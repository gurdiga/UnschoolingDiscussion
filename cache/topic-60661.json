That it was external to you rather than your reactions and thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible you&#39;re just irritated by singing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI sing, my kids sing, there&#39;s a lot of singing at our house, and my kids know some musical theatre (not classical opera much).   Yesterday I said &quot;Marty, Holly and I are going to see Gilbert and Sullivan at Popejoy, but I didn&#39;t invite you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said eagerly, &quot;Really?  Gilbert and Sullivan themselves are going to be at Popejoy!?&quot;  Very enthusiastically and sarcastically.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s on a Sunday at 3:00, the only showing, and he has something he always does on Sundays.  He asked which one it was and I said &quot;The Mikado,&quot; and he said &quot;Don&#39;t know it; don&#39;t care.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If it had been HMS Pinafore, you&#39;d&#39;ve wanted to go?&quot;  He shrugged positively and waggled his head some.<br/>\n&quot;Pirates of Penzance?&quot; Nodded solidly.<br/>\nHe&#39;s 22.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day before, I had told him, &quot;When I go to England, I should forget modern stuff.  No Lion King or that.  I should go see Gilbert and Sullivan.&quot;  The next morning by e-mail there was an offering for tickets for a single local performance of a traveling show. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m telling that for a couple of reasons.   People ask, &quot;Yes, but HOW...&quot; about conversations and suggestions, and there&#39;s a fresh example.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCommunicating things lightly and positively gives kids an opportunity to think on their own rather than to be reactive to a parent&#39;s suggestions or opinions or attitudes.  It&#39;s worth remembering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I wrote &quot;It&#39;s possible you&#39;re just irritated by singing&quot; is that a girl I&#39;ve known since birth, a bit older than my kids, has two parents who are artists but not good singers.  She was very artistic as a kid--sculpted things, built things out of paper and cardboard and foil, drew.   When she was at our house she would sometimes say &quot;Stop singing,&quot; to my kids who didn&#39;t even realize they were singing.   She asked me once, &quot;Why are they always singing?&quot;   It just bugged her.  She preferred it quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sing-songy voice is good to avoid, even for people who didn&#39;t mind it much as a child.   Here&#39;s a fun story:<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the nicest of words can be ruined, though, if they&#39;re spoken in a condescending, treacly way. It&#39;s not bad for infants, and it&#39;s great for French poodles. It&#39;s that talking-to-a-French-poodle voice, and the thoughts that go with it, that should be avoided when parents are talking to their children. Dan Vilter shared this story on the AlwaysLearning list in 2001:<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a park day, we were having a discussion about the usefulness of praise and sincerity. The unschoolers in the group were trying to point out the fallacy of over and insincere praise, and indirectly about treating your children as people first. After much talk getting nowhere, one of the other unschooling parents turned to me and in the French poodle voice started thanking me for all the things I had done for the group that day. Something like,&quot;Oh Dan, thank you for bringing the stove for hot cocoa. You did such a good job setting it up and heating the water! You&#39;re so strong carrying that big jug of water all by yourself!&quot; Everyone had a good laugh and the point was succinctly made.<br/>\n�Dan Vilter<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tone\">http://sandradodd.com/tone</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Out of the batcave...into the light?","postDate":"1303189624","msgId":60720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDREQUQxODc4LjUwMzA0MDNAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGk9YmN6ZW9EPUhtMTIzV2NfMUdrdFBULWorRHFBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlvaGhnMCtiYTE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MDRDRUFGODktNDZCMC00NjQ5LTk4N0EtRDA5QjFDNDA0OUYwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkFOTGtUaT1iY3plb0Q9SG0xMjNXY18xR2t0UFQtaitEcUFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60719,"nextInTopic":60722,"prevInTime":60719,"nextInTime":60721,"topicId":60661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But I had a few very clear thoughts as I read and felt prompted to contribute. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I understand of the world and history, narrative has been a piece of human culture since... well since the birth of culture.  People tell stories, always have.  Its just the medium that has changed over time.  Narrative is used to explore uncomfortable, scary, bad, lovely, great, beautiful, wondrous ideas. Various mythologies, Shakespeare&#39;s plays, biblical stories, modern literature - they are all exploring what it means to be human through narrative.  I even dream in a sort of narrative.  If TV and books weren&#39;t around (since you don&#39;t seem to be afraid of the medium, but more the idea of narrative), your son might be play-acting the stories you passed down orally, or that he saw in theatre, or from other children&#39;s play.  This is one way to work through ideas that scare or delight us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRepetitiveness is also very common in young children. My kids love to watch the same episodes of shows again and again, or read the same books over again, or sew the same embroidery, cook the same recipe, etc. (They also delight in new things to do).  My daughter goes through the same play-acting with me day in and out, with occasional changes.  Right now we are Alicia and Dora nearly every day all the time (and little brother is Baby Jaguar).  As it goes on for weeks at a time, it gets slightly more sophisticated... although I have to be paying attention to notice. <br/>\n<br/>\nI posit that this is the mental equivalent to what kids do on the jungle-gym, mental gymnastics, building/flexing their minds.  Following his cues is allowing him to build/flex his mind-muscle so much more than if you weren&#39;t following his cues.  Instead of shutting down that play, you are participating in its growth.  And I&#39;m fairly sure this is somewhat true, because my own mental flexibility has grown as I&#39;ve re-learned how to really play with my kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShira Rocklin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Out of the batcave...into the light?","postDate":"1303126736","msgId":60702,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMjg2NC43OTgyOC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGltc1VhU3NtQkdzcm9NODJablRkVERpNStEbThBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlvZXBnNitrZjBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDg1MUJGMzEtMzFFMC00QUFGLUI4QjItQUU1QkQ5MjU3MUIyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkFOTGtUaW5fYUxvVGRRdUwzTDROdUJfMkxMOFFNMWpod2dAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw2OTYzNTkuOTkxMjYucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDA2Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPEJBTkxrVGltc1VhU3NtQkdzcm9NODJablRkVERpNStEbThBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60701,"nextInTopic":60704,"prevInTime":60701,"nextInTime":60703,"topicId":60661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When Simon was little I was afraid of the television.

It sounds ludicrous now, <br/>\nbut when he was little I remembered my own passive seeming relationship with the <br/>\ntelevision and predicted that it was what his life would be like if I let him <br/>\nwatch television. I wanted to protect Simon from my own experience and when <br/>\nother folks would tell me about how they don&#39;t let their children watch <br/>\ntelevision I would think with some kind of envy that they must be better parents <br/>\nthem me. The problem was that Simon enjoyed television. He liked Tellytubbies <br/>\nand Bear in the Big Blue House and Blues Clues and Barney. He liked to sit in my <br/>\nlap and have me enjoy the shows with him. He liked to talk about the things he&#39;s <br/>\nseen, he liked to dance to the music, he liked to dance with me to the music. <br/>\nAnd when I watched him watching the shows and when I engaged with him watching <br/>\nthe shows, I didn&#39;t see a passive seeming relationship, I saw an engaged and <br/>\nhappy little boy hanging out with his happy and engaged mum. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was watching television as a child and as a teenager and as a young adult <br/>\nI was often using it to relax, to zone, to obscure other aspects of my life. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t an addiction, it was a kind of self-medication, without really any <br/>\nnegative side effects. But people talked about me being helpless in front of the <br/>\ntelevision, and I believed them. I believed that it was an evil thing that <br/>\noverpowered me, I accepted that narrative. You mention liking Hans Christian <br/>\nAndersen. I reread the Snow Queen recently and thought a lot about how Kai&#39;s <br/>\nchanged perspective is about an evil entering him, an evil that is separate from <br/>\nwho he is, and how wonderfully passive that is. I don&#39;t buy into that narrative. <br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that a happy little boy, living a good life in a garret with his <br/>\nbest friend across the balcony would be struck down by a piece of glass from an <br/>\nevil mirror. But you seem to. Maybe back up and look at your happy boy enjoying <br/>\nBatman (which is a really cool story) and let go of the notion that he is going <br/>\nto be destroyed by a piece of glass that enters his heart and his eye. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Out of the batcave...into the light?","postDate":"1303124223","msgId":60701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzRDQzMTcxLUNFRTUtNDVDOC1CQTFBLTJERkU1REIzNDA3QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGluX2FMb1RkUXVMM0w0TnVCXzJMTDhRTTFqaHdnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlvZXBnNitrZjBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDg1MUJGMzEtMzFFMC00QUFGLUI4QjItQUU1QkQ5MjU3MUIyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QkFOTGtUaW5fYUxvVGRRdUwzTDROdUJfMkxMOFFNMWpod2dAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60697,"nextInTopic":60702,"prevInTime":60700,"nextInTime":60702,"topicId":60661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Isn&#39;t this healthier?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you think a healthy person would choose an unhealthy reaction?  <br/>\nPeople *think* that&#39;s common in real life, but it&#39;s common in stories.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s what we interpret has happened in real life when we can only see  <br/>\nthe surface of a person&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nStories give us a warped view of why people make choices. Even further  <br/>\nI think there may be some primal need to seek out demons to blame our  <br/>\nweaknesses on. It&#39;s more satisfying for people to believe the devil  <br/>\n(or TV or corporations, drugs, sex in our culture, rock music) made  <br/>\nthem do something. It&#39;s more satisfying in a story to have a bad thing  <br/>\nto focus on as the cause than to delve into all the damage from  <br/>\nparenting and school that<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is your desire to take away something he enjoys any different than  <br/>\na Christian&#39;s desire for a whole spirit for their child that they want  <br/>\nto achieve by limiting access to the secular world?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can&#39;t be a whole person until you see the whole person he is. Stop  <br/>\nlooking outward and see him. Is he happy?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s unhealthy is looking at a happy person and seeing sickness  <br/>\nbecause outside sources are saying you can&#39;t trust what you observe.  <br/>\nGet the theories out from between you and your son and look right at  <br/>\nhim and see him as a whole being right now. You&#39;re doing what you fear  <br/>\nhe&#39;s doing. You&#39;re seeing and believing this fantasy that you&#39;re  <br/>\ncreating instead of who he is.

People who have grown up limited to the ideas their  <br/>\nparents think are best for them. Some people fight against the control  <br/>\n-- and fight against their parents.

Seriously. People have a &quot;dark side&quot; when their passions are seen as undesirable. My dark side was (brace yourself) handcrafts. Yes, smart girl me who had succeeded in being bad at sports, felt I had to hide the fact that I liked to cross stitch and knit. As dark sides go, that might not seem so bad, but its tied up in a whooooole lot of scary sexist baggage about what makes people good and strong and smart and right. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoys run into that kind of baggage too, and it can lead to other kinds of &quot;dark sides&quot;.

But your son won&#39;t learn to stuff his feelings watching batman - he&#39;ll learn to stuff them if you say &quot;what you love isn&#39;t important&quot;. Your words and actions are far, far more powerful than a tv show.

If you are interested in exploring more complex <br/>\nnarratives on good vs. bad, try some Hayao Miyazaki movies.  His approach seems <br/>\nto be that there is good and bad in everyone and it&#39;s not so dualistic and <br/>\nsimplistic.  Actually a lot of anime comes from that approach.  Even Batman is a <br/>\nbit like that, the &quot;bad&quot; guys have reasons for being that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter has spent her life in narrative.

She would have <br/>\nbeen the kid secretly reading with a flashlight at night to get stories, or <br/>\ngoing to sleepovers just to watch movies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a fiction writer, it&#39;s likely your own childhood was imbued with <br/>\nstories.  It could be genetic.  It could be how your child processes the world! <br/>\n When my oldest gets in a funk, the best thing I can do for her is to invite her <br/>\nto watch a movie or TV series for hours.

To tell a good story, you have to know the parts of a story and how they hang together, so you study stories. You read them or listen to them or watch them as shows or plays and then repeat them as exactly as you can to be sure you have the parts right. There are writing classes that give people modles to study. There are painting schools that start students by copying the work of &quot;great masters&quot;. How do people learn ballet? Lots and lots of repetition of other people&#39;s work. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids know all that, already, so they find things that intrigue them and repeat them over and over, to get a sense of how they go together. Not all kids all the time, but its a big, big part of learning for many people. Parents and teachers find that upsetting because the child has chosen what to imitate - but batman isn&#39;t inherently worse than the Brothers Grimm or folk tales or religious stories.

My son just turned three.  We don&#39;t have a television in our house, but we have internet and laptops and we watch dvds, netflix and you tube. I actually just cancelled netflix as we are sick of the watch instantly selections and with nicer weather can walk daily to the library to pick new dvds. We&#39;re relatively new to our area so our library dvd selection is largely untapped.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how batman first came into our lives.  Sometimes we buy a shirt or a plate that has a picture on it, sometimes we get a DVD at the library, or we just hear about something,  We get on the internet, surf around, and see what we can find. My son loves heroic figures.  The first one he loved was Don Quixote, we had gotten a DVD and he rode around on his pole horse with his foam sword shouting &quot;Dulcinia, I am here to save you!&quot; He loves underdog very much as well. But Batman has been his favorite.  No one else is ever allowed to enact batman but him, which of course is fine with us. We have a batman cape, and I&#39;ve put in many hours as robin and catwoman. We&#39;ve made a shadowpuppet theatre with all of the figures from the television program, The Batman. We&#39;ve managed without television to watch this program many, many times and we all actually enjoy it. i think it is nicely drawn and stunningly colorized, and there are some ironies that my DH and I appreciate. Its themes, on the other hand, do cause me some concern. Batman, the hero, is also a wealthy industrialist with little or no relationships or connection to the world around him except through his masked identity. I could speak at length about my objections to the shows premise but it doesn&#39;t matter-- I do not think my son appreciates all of that.

I am not so concerned about this, but I worry in exactly the same way about narrative.  Is narrative obscuring the world for my son, what attitudes is this narrative tracing in his young mind, what other facets our world could it be potentially blinding him to?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany of our other activities have become batman themed. I often introduce batman themed activities In our play because it so delights my son. Our shadowpuppet theate has a cast of superheros and villians from all different shows. I do see that my son is sometimes testing the limits of the many narratives we&#39;ve seen, but more often we are just reenacting the shows.  I like that we&#39;ve seen so many different batmans via the amazing internet, but I am worried that my son will be limited by these core narratives. narrative is what causes us to select from the vast stimuli, to choose what to preference and notice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany days go by with no shows at all, we spend entire days outside in our yard, playing with sand or in the water table, working on the garden, and reading in our tent. My son has chosen to take numerous books out to our thin mesh tent and it has become a reading room.  Of course, I have the same fears with books as I do with media, concerns about narrative. I do not think I am bringing these fears into my play with my son, I am somehow able to suspend disbelief. Probably because my son is so adorable and funny I really love playing with him! Nor are my concerns all about batman, or necessarily related to the violence of those shows.  we wrestle and play fight with our very physical son and always have. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were playing at our water table last week, adding colors and leaves and dirt and grass and mixing things up. He started calling me scientist mommy and talking about doing experiments, like we&#39;d seen on the Backyardigans.  i worry--is he experiencing the tactile expereince, feeling the textures, the sunlight on the water, etc. if he is preoccupied with playing a role?  I fear something is being lost!    <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t restrict my son, we will even watch the same show multiple times if he requests.  He sometimes requests a particular scene. I know he is doing this in order to get the part down better, as he is able to imitate the characters very well. But he is also totally enamored with the heroic figure in all its forms and told me the other day that he wants to protect me and save me. I hugged him and told him I feel the same way. The other day he asked me after his nap (did he have a dream I wonder?) if there are bad things in the world. When I admitted, mildly, that there were, he said, in a voice with trembling with emotion, that he would fight those things.  I don&#39;t know what to think of this. When he&#39;s frightened by something he slips on his batman gloves and is brave. Sometimes he is very timid and whispers...is this the real child beneath all the barman bravado? Is all of this playacting, with dh and I following his cues, healthy? Please help!   <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long post and thanks in advance for your time in reading and responding! <br/>\n<br/>\nSasha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60636,"nextTopicId":60775}}
