I have been reading along and see what you <br/>\nare intending. Good stuff imo. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when I use the phrase &quot;have to&quot; in the standard way it is used in <br/>\nEnglish I mean it in the if-then way -- really it&#39;s how real life works for me. <br/>\nIf I want to pay the bills, I &quot;have to&quot; go put money in the bank.

Unless somebody wants to think that my bill-paying habits are something <br/>\nworth deep contemplation. <br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH sometimes using the phrase &quot;have to&quot; may be a bad habit that needs to be <br/>\ncorrected in our thinking -- to help expand the possibilities. Sometimes <br/>\nusing the phrase &quot;have to&quot; is an everyday expression about how the day needs to go <br/>\nto get from point A to point B. Two usages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe frustration I sense in this thread is coming from a failure to <br/>\nacknowledge both meanings and usages. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, there are probably more than two, but if Johnny wants to get to point <br/>\nB, he may &quot;have to&quot; pass through point A. He may be choosing both. Now I &quot;have <br/>\nto&quot; go warm up the coffee -- because I choose to have another cup. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance (who spent most of yesterday afternoon explaining hsing to an Uncle who <br/>\nwas truly nice and supportive but astonished -- the word &quot;unschooling&quot; was <br/>\nmentioned, but really in passing -- just the idea of hsing was big news! :) )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86871,"nextTopicId":86835}}
