The learning chosen could be<br/>\nancient Greek or auto mechanics, the timetable could be at any age and<br/>\nit could be instant &quot;on-the-spot&quot; learning or choosing to take a 6-month<br/>\ncommunity college course, and the method could be totally by oneself<br/>\nwithout any supervision, walking in the woods, sitting down at the<br/>\nkitchen table for weeks with a workbook, or attending a class.  What<br/>\nseparates &quot;unschooling&quot; from more traditional approaches is neither the<br/>\nsubject matter nor the timetable nor the method, but the fact that the<br/>\nchild, faced with the range of options, freely (or as freely as<br/>\npossible) chooses all three.  And there is never such a thing as not<br/>\nchoosing, for children (like the rest of us) are learning all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"FUN (Billy & Nancy)","from":"&quot;FUN (Billy & Nancy)&quot; &lt;FUNLists@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jz97_QM0FFi6lvHZmFJTbP6Fqwty03BdEuuDZYkuoYsBhihEtbDWhVCNvEdiepnCIQOuXnxVozEo8pzgq1atsUDN3eOs8qqUhBK_z8oQDgzu_Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unschooling defined?","postDate":"928594970","msgId":534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy41My41MzQuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":528,"nextInTopic":539,"prevInTime":533,"nextInTime":535,"topicId":528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve always compared unschooling to Bruce Lee s Jeet Kune Do (a style of martial arts).

Basically, Lee believed that there wasn&#39;t any one &quot;best&quot;<br/>\nstyle or way to do things. Some people were taller than others, some were<br/>\nfast, some were strong, some were left handed. Because of these variations,<br/>\nwhat worked well for one person might not work well for another. He felt<br/>\nthat Jeet Kune Do was not about technique or doctrine but about the<br/>\nindividual. Thus, a big part of the art was to learn what worked best for<br/>\nyou and to do that. He borrowed freely from other styles to take what worked<br/>\nfor him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLee felt that trying to define Jeet Kune Do is to miss the point. He said<br/>\n&quot;If people say Jeet Kune Do is different from &#39;this&#39; or from &#39;that,&#39; then<br/>\nlet the name of Jeet Kune Do be wiped out, for that is what it is, just a<br/>\nname.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the same is true of unschooling. When you put the focus on the<br/>\nlearner and work from their strengths or interests, that is unschooling.<br/>\nThen it doesn&#39;t matter if the learner uses a linear, incremental approach<br/>\n(like many workbooks) or has a more gestalt approach where the seem to go<br/>\nfrom nothing to a complete understanding overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you start trying to apply strict definitions as to what unschooling is<br/>\nor isn&#39;t, then you are limiting yourself and missing the point. I&#39;ve heard<br/>\ntoo many people say that their kid wants a workbook on a particular subject<br/>\nbut they won&#39;t buy it because they are unschoolers. If that&#39;s the way they<br/>\nlearn best, then that&#39;s the way to do it. And that&#39;s the point. Unschooling<br/>\nis about learning, not about teaching. When you eliminate options without<br/>\nregard for how well they work or don&#39;t work but just because they don&#39;t fit<br/>\na definition of unschooling, then you are no longer unschooling. Unschooling<br/>\nis also about freedom and why you do things, not about what you do. As Nance<br/>\npointed out, you can be a stay at home mom and still be a feminist. That&#39;s<br/>\nbecause you had the freedom to choose. In fact, there are many women who<br/>\nwork outside of the home who are not feminists, but feel they have no choice<br/>\nbecause they need the income or their husbands have told them they have to<br/>\nwork. Again, it&#39;s not what you do but why you do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the hard part is to discover what really works best and why a<br/>\nchild wants to take a particular approach. Do they want workbooks because<br/>\nthey have been in school and think that&#39;s the only way to learn? Do they<br/>\nexpect you to tell them what to do, to be the expert on every subject, and<br/>\nto teach them? It may take a while for them to realize that learning is<br/>\nsomething they have to do, not something you do to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother Bruce Lee quote that could apply to unschooling: &quot;Self-knowledge is<br/>\nthe basis of Jeet Kune Do because it is effective, not only for the<br/>\nindividual&#39;s martial art, but for his life as a human being.&quot; (Can you tell<br/>\nBruce Lee was a philosophy major in college?)<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\n<br/>\n&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/<br/>\nF.U.N.
