I know <br/>\n<br/>\nbetter. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Eddie Izzard DVD lives here now.  We bought one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to share it with a longtime friend.  He has a son who&#39;s seven or <br/>\neight, and he asked if Josh could watch it.  I said sure, but the guy uses <br/>\nthe word &quot;Fuck.&quot;   So Josh couldn&#39;t watch it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids can.  And the discussions which have ensued, the &quot;dots which have <br/>\nbeen connected,&quot; the facets added to things they already had some ideas about <br/>\nare HUGE.  More information than most kids ever get out of the purely best <br/>\nday of school in their lives my kids could get out of this one two-hour <br/>\ncomedy routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt only could happen because I was interested (Marty kept telling me I would <br/>\nreally like Eddie Izzard, and Marty had only heard quotes from other kids who <br/>\nhad seen it), because I was not freaked out about them hearing &quot;fuck.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I eliminate that word, I limit them to input of people who also eliminate <br/>\nthat word.  If I shelter them from a movie that might have that word, they <br/>\nmiss a lot of ideas and connections.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when people say &quot;How do your kids know so much? How have they learned all <br/>\nthis history?&quot; I just say they have access to everything and they make <br/>\nconnections all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend.  (Kind of former friend now, because she&#39;s a teacher and <br/>\nkept thinking I would come to my senses and send my kids to school.)   She <br/>\nloved my chocolate chip cookies.  (Literally; I&#39;m off that cookie analogy and <br/>\nonto real toll-house cookies with pecans now.)  She gushed and made a huge <br/>\ndeal.  HOW do you get them to do this?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, I use real butter, and...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well I&#39;m not going to use butter.  I&#39;m going to use margarine.  And then <br/>\nwhat?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen nothing.  Or, then I refrigerate the dough, actually, so they start to <br/>\ncook before they melt out flat.  That part&#39;s important.  But to say &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>\ngoing to use butter, but I want mine to be just like yours&quot;--that&#39;s a big <br/>\nwaste of my time and energy to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf her principles and priorities say &quot;No butter,&quot; then that&#39;s fine.  She can <br/>\nlive a butter-free life and get cookie recipes elsewhere.  But for her to eat <br/>\nmy cookies and praise them is hypocritical.  And for her to reject my advice <br/>\nbecause it goes against her principles is fine, but took five minutes off my <br/>\nlife energy! &lt;bwg&gt;  (I just ate another cookie and recovered.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when people admire my kids&#39; attitudes and behavior and compassion and <br/>\nhumor and then they say &quot;How can I get my kids to be like your kids?&quot;   I <br/>\nwill invariably say &quot;lighten up, loosen up, let them watch TV, let them watch <br/>\nmovies.&quot;  And every once in a while someone comes along and says, &quot;Well, <br/>\nyeah, as long as they&#39;re not R rated movies, there&#39;s no language, sex, <br/>\nviolence, guns, offensive views of women, and as long as the games they play <br/>\nare wholesome and they turn it off by 10:00 and TV sucks so we&#39;re not going <br/>\nto have one, but HOW can my kids be just like YOURS!???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVery sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly as rented the first disk of The Family Guy and is watching it in the <br/>\nnext room, laughing by himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6121707,"authorName":"Jana Eagle","from":"Jana Eagle &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"jana_eagle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"arthurian legend","postDate":"1051639432","msgId":66653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2M2NrMXJ4aXYuZnNmQGh1Z28uRklHPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyYi4yOGM4MWZjNC4yYmUwMGQxMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66631,"nextInTopic":66661,"prevInTime":66652,"nextInTime":66654,"topicId":66566,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"just thought someone here might be able to recommend a place to start for an adult wanting to learn about arthurian legend.  i read The Mists of Avalon by","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-305769567\">just thought someone here might be able to recommend a place to start<br/>\nfor an adult wanting to learn about arthurian legend.  i read The<br/>\nMists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley and really liked it... more<br/>\nfor its beautiful vision of goddess culture and its writing.   it was<br/>\nalso very easy to get lost in the story.   <br/>\n<br/>\nany suggestions about where to go next?  while briefly looking around<br/>\ni am astounded at how much stuff is out there.<br/>\n<br/>\njana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Okay, I&#39;m going to try this today","postDate":"1051636498","msgId":66631,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYi4yOGM4MWZjNC4yYmUwMGQxMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":66566,"nextInTopic":66653,"prevInTime":66630,"nextInTime":66632,"topicId":66566,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/29/2003 10:10:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
