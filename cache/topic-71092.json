They&#39;ve decided two things which matter here.  They&#39;re <br/>\nstaying in England, and she&#39;s planning to homeschool her son who&#39;s three (or <br/>\npossibly four, Holly would know but she&#39;s asleep).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey homeschooled their oldest a bit when she was little, but the kid <br/>\npreferred school.  Under their circumstances then, I understand why!  She was living <br/>\nreally new the flagship hippie school of the district, which had been open <br/>\nclassroom, which hosted the first &quot;family schools,&quot; which is the place <br/>\nalternative teachers want to be.  So it wasn&#39;t a fair representative sample of public <br/>\nschool. &lt;g&gt;   When they moved to England she wanted to try the local schools and <br/>\nhas really loved it, as a challenge, as an experience nobody back home will <br/>\nhave had, and it&#39;s always helped that she didn&#39;t HAVE to go, but I&#39;ll tell you, <br/>\nshe loves the uniforms, she lives the lunches, she loves the exotic games the <br/>\nkids play and the little traditions that are foreign to Americans.  And she&#39;s <br/>\nbeen admitted into some more special midschool (whatever their terms for <br/>\njust-past-elementary) in London she had to test into so she&#39;s in school-experience <br/>\nheaven and likes the friends she&#39;s made there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two other children, though, who have no American experience, for <br/>\nwhom it will  NOT be exotic and spa-like to go to the nearest school.  One was <br/>\nborn in January.  One moved there as an infant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her about Hesfes before it was over, so she might even have gone out <br/>\nto check it out.  We have done MUCH weird camping together.  She&#39;s definitely <br/>\nequipped and able to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I&#39;m Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaccckkkkk","postDate":"1054127708","msgId":71097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA2MWYwMWMzMjUxYiQyOWFmMTJiMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDhmLjJkNTU4YmI2LjJjMDVmNDdhQGFvbC5jb20+IDwzRUQ0QTMyMi5DOThENkRCRkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":71092,"nextInTopic":71101,"prevInTime":71096,"nextInTime":71098,"topicId":71092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks so much!!
