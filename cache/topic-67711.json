I googled &quot;cdc child deaths&quot; and found a lot of lengthy<br/>\nstatistics, including that 63% of mva fatalities are in rural areas.<br/>\n(Who would have guessed that?) Also there are fewer mva deaths now than<br/>\nin 1953, a result that the website writer attributed almost entirely to<br/>\nsafety features in vehicles including seat belts, and stronger crack<br/>\ndowns on drunk drivers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line for me: I don&#39;t think we can expect our children to put on<br/>\ntheir seatbelts if we don&#39;t do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/spotlite/chldseat.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/spotlite/chldseat.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNational Child Passenger Safety Week<br/>\nFebruary 9-15, 2003  <br/>\n<br/>\nMotor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children in<br/>\nthe United States. In the United States during 2001, 1579 children ages<br/>\n14 years and younger died as occupants in motor vehicle crashes, and<br/>\napproximately 228,000 were injured. That&#39;s an average of 30 deaths and<br/>\nmore than 4,300 injuries each week (NHTSA 2002). <br/>\n<br/>\nOf the children ages 4 years and younger who were fatally injured in<br/>\n2001, nearly 50 percent were completely unrestrained (NHTSA 2002).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of these injuries could have been prevented. Placing children in<br/>\nage-appropriate restraint systems reduces serious and fatal injuries by<br/>\nmore than half (NHTSA 2002).  <br/>\n<br/>\nNational Child Passenger Safety Week occurs each year during the week of<br/>\nValentine&#39;s Day, bringing public attention to the importance of safely<br/>\ntransporting children. This year, the focus of National Child Passenger<br/>\nSafety Week is on the 4 Steps for Kids: rear-facing infant seats,<br/>\nforward-facing toddler seats, booster seats, and finally seat belts.
