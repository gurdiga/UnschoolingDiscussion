Currently, her Cooper&#39;s Hawk is fostering 5 baby Cooper&#39;s Hawks that the local authorities removed from a hotel courtyard (the parents were attacking guests!) her son is fostering some starling babies, along with the hummingbirds.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince baby birds eat frequently (like every 20 minutes for those little hummers!) she carries them with her when she goes out.  Little tiny nest in a cardboard box covered with cheesecloth and a cloth diaper to keep them warm.  She was feeding them from a tiny syringe, and the kids got to watch.  To get them to open their mouths for food, she gently blows over them to simulate the movement of their mother&#39;s wings.  They open their beaks wide and she puts several drops of food in. In the wild, the mother feeds babies regurgitated food until they fledge and begin to find their own food.  We learned that while hummingbirds will happily eat sugar water, they are in fact carnivores.  The reason they drink nectar in the wild is to get the tiny insects that hide in the flowers.   The tiny birds were so cute, and it was great to learn more about them.   The boys really enjoyed it all.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.  Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo!

We <br/>\nare really excited but we only think one is a hummingbird nest.
