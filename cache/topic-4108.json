We want to give them all our support and see the<br/>\nfamily growing together, learning together.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents had attended a gathering in Madrid where they became acquainted<br/>\nwith John Holt&#39;s work.  Here was a kindred spirit whose writings resonated<br/>\nin their hearts and minds.  They had found the course that they would take<br/>\n- parents as teachers, learners together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome education is neither legal nor illegal in Spain; local school<br/>\nauthorities decide each case.  In the case of this family, the response of<br/>\nauthorities was to file suit against them in court.  The parents had tried<br/>\nto telephone both the Inspector of Schools and the local authorities, but<br/>\ntheir calls were never returned. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Delegate hasn&#39;t returned calls; the Inspector hasn&#39;t returned calls. <br/>\nWe want them to know our position,&quot; states a quote from Lola in La Voz de<br/>\nAlmeria, September 18, 1999.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an entire week this September, the newspaper, La Voz de Almeria,<br/>\npublished a series of articles about the family&#39;s home schooling.  The<br/>\nsituation was thoroughly examined from every possible angle-the family&#39;s<br/>\nreasons for their choice, the court proceedings, the local authorities&#39;<br/>\nresponse, and the actions of the State Inspector.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe local school principal reported that she &quot;did her duty by informing the<br/>\nState School Inspector&quot; as soon as she learned of the family&#39;s home<br/>\neducating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe headlines and subtitles pretty much tell the tale:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;GABRIEL LIVES 6000 KILOMETERS FROM THE SCHOOL.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Ministry of Education admits that this is an atypical situation but<br/>\ndefends compulsory education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne photo of Gabriel playing in his yard was captioned, &quot;The garden and the<br/>\nopen area that surround the house, together with the plaza and the park of<br/>\nthe town, are the scenarios for the child&#39;s games.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The tribunal disagrees about the higher right of parents regarding the<br/>\nschooling of their children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&#39;Our Child is a Happy Child. Gabriel Eats when he wants to.  Neither<br/>\nbefore nor after. Textbooks bore him,&#39; says his mother.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No child should be deprived of the companionship of other children,&quot;<br/>\nopines the Delegate of Education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was, also, a grave misunderstanding about the use of the Internet. <br/>\nLola maintains regular communication with her Clonlara-assigned contact<br/>\nteacher via email over the Internet.  In early articles, the newspaper<br/>\nreporter&#39;s observations were misconstrued by school officials who got the<br/>\nimpression that Gabriel was being schooled over the Internet.  This caused<br/>\na ruckus, naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education authorities are looking for legal ways to stop a young boy of<br/>\neight years old from studying only over the Internet,&quot; blares one headline.<br/>\n The article under it states that Gabriel spends 10 hours each day laboring<br/>\nover the keyboard.  Lola is then called upon to make the correction that it<br/>\nis she herself who uses the Internet (but not for 10 hours a day).  Gabriel<br/>\ndoes not even know the keyboard yet and he shows absolutely no interest in<br/>\nusing it.  A second headline shouts: &quot;What they have said about this child<br/>\nspending ten hours connected on the Internet is totally false.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDe`ja vu all over again?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rights of parents to determine the educational choice for their<br/>\nchildren, the underlying distrust of parents to determine the educational<br/>\nchoice for their children, the underlying distrust of parents by school<br/>\nauthorities to choose wisely, and the threat that home education makes to<br/>\nconventional schooling are all part of the mix.  The scene has been played<br/>\nout in homes and towns and cities all over the United States in the last 25<br/>\nor so years; it has run its course through school districts and courtrooms<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it has reached fever pitch in Spain.  Oh, there have been home<br/>\nschoolers in that country for years, but they operated &quot;underground.&quot; This<br/>\nfamily has been forced into the public spotlight, a position that curbs<br/>\ntheir freedom to educate in peace, without undue interference.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We never thought that is would cause so much dust to blow up,&quot; states Lola<br/>\nin La Voz.  Hear! Hear!<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps now that the issue is public, the local and state school<br/>\nauthorities and the editor of La Voz de Almeria may benefit by hearing the<br/>\ntrue stories of success from home educators in America.  You can share the<br/>\ngood news, as you know it, with them.  You can help alleviate the distrust<br/>\nand the fear of the authorities.
