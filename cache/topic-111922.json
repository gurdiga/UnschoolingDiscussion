I DO find myself wanting to use a slightly<br/>\nhigher pitch with wee babsies....and of course we sing silly songs and<br/>\nsuch.But I don&#39;t pay attention to using only certain words, or<br/>\nsimplifying my sentences. I just talk to them.<br/>\nI told them things I might not tell an adult, like &quot;ok, I&#39;m going to<br/>\nthe bathroom now, then we&#39;re going to get into the van&quot; blah, blah, blah.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to them and explained things as we went about our day. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t  assume they could or couldn&#39;t understand. I just explained<br/>\nanyway. I don&#39;t use a different voice with little people, but I did<br/>\nfind myself talking to my babies in a higher pitch occasionally like<br/>\nRobyn.<br/>\nNOT that sweet, syrupy voice I find SO appalling. Major yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had people talk to my kids that way and it really bothered them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111222,"nextTopicId":111584}}
