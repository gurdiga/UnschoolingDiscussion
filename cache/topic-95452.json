My two kids are like night and <br/>\nday in this regard. One total risk-taker, one very cautious kid. Both <br/>\nhave had respectful parenting and unschooling from the start.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me, my parents weren&#39;t particularly supportive of most of my <br/>\nendeavors, but I&#39;m a whole lot like my daughter - fearless and bull-<br/>\nheaded. When my parents wouldn&#39;t support what I was doing, I left. <br/>\nWhen I ran out of money, I lived on the streets. I don&#39;t think it had <br/>\nall that much to do with what my parents did or didn&#39;t do, more or <br/>\nless what I was born with. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as encouraging or discouraging goes, I think that can <br/>\ndefinitely make a difference with kids who are by nature more <br/>\ncautious. I think if my son ends up taking risks it will most likely <br/>\nbe because we have stood by him while he tried the waters, didn&#39;t <br/>\nforce him to do things he didn&#39;t want to do, but gently encouraged <br/>\nhim. For instance, he didn&#39;t want to go in water until he was almost <br/>\nfive. I think if we had pushed something like swimming lessons on <br/>\nhim, we could&#39;ve really freaked him out about it and had him <br/>\nassociating water with panic. I&#39;ve worked with adults who have that <br/>\nwater-panic connection and it&#39;s hard to get past. But because we let <br/>\nhim come to it in his own time and his own way, he was able to do it <br/>\ncautiously enough to suit him. Supporting the non-risk taker allows <br/>\nthem to find their way to being more adventurous. Of course, my <br/>\ndaughter was flinging herself into the deep end of swimming pools <br/>\nlong before she could swim. For her, support means finding ways for <br/>\nher to do things safely that she would go ahead and do anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My father was incredibly encouraging.

First books, then through the Greater Columbia Obedience  <br/>\nClub.I started training my first dog when I was 11. I started teaching classes  <br/>\nwhen I was 16. When I lived in California and Germany, I got paid. When I  teach <br/>\nfor the club, I volunteer.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nDog grooming. I was living in Germany, and one of the women asked whether I  <br/>\nknew of a good groomer that spoke some english. I went home and told Ben that <br/>\nI  though *I* should start grooming. I did. Books and meeting <br/>\nhandlers/breeders and  picking their brains and trial and error. Then before I left Germany, I <br/>\n trained someone to take over my clientele. That happened again when I left <br/>\nSt  Louis, and again when I sold my mobile business here in Columbia five years <br/>\nago.  I&#39;ve netted as much as $50,000/year grooming. Yes, you can make a <br/>\nliving!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nGardening. If you had told me 20 years ago that I would have been a  <br/>\ngardener, I would have laughed in your face! &lt;g&gt; No money there, but I  grow many of <br/>\nour vegetables. fruits, and all our herbs and flowers. I gave a  <br/>\nbutterfly/hummingbird gardening class for our homeschool group the first  year. I&#39;m really <br/>\nbig on trial and error there! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nCeramic tiling. Kathryn&#39;s offered to pay me! &lt;G&gt; But I have done  other <br/>\npeople&#39;s bathrooms and kitchens as well as my own. Could I make a living?  <br/>\nPossibly. Same with wallpapering.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nCooking. I&#39;ve sold desserts to restaurants. Not really a living, but extra  <br/>\n$$$.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMore food: we (my family---dad and brother) opened a provincial french  <br/>\nrestaurant. I managed the front (waitstaff, bar, and dining room). Just dining  out <br/>\na lot, taking notes, working as a waitressand hostessing at other  <br/>\nrestaurants, and trying to treat the staff as I would like to have been  treated.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHorses. I&#39;ve taught lessons, ridden race horses, and opened a tack  shop.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nDogs, again----I&#39;m a junior showmanship judge. One of the girls I used  to <br/>\nwork with is a professional handler now. She&#39;s awesome.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd the conference. Just throw me in, and I&#39;ll swim.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHow to be a great mom! &lt;G&gt; Thanks to the wonderful moms here and on  the <br/>\nboards.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nCan I toss something else out there?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nBen and I had a discusion last week about *why* I&#39;m so fearless when it  <br/>\ncomes to trying new things. He&#39;s rather timid, but trying to gain some insight  <br/>\ninto why.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nOur conclusion (based entirely on our own personal histories) is that  you&#39;re <br/>\nable to BE fearless when you are absolutely sure you have a fall-back  <br/>\nposition----a safety net, so to speak.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMy father was incredibly encouraging. And even if I failed, he would cover  <br/>\nmy butt. Not just big things---and not just little things. I always knew that I <br/>\n had a home to crawl back to or a money source when I was broke. He was  <br/>\nALWAYS there. Always.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nBen&#39;s family figures that, if you are an adult, you should just suck it up  <br/>\nand fix the problem----they won&#39;t help. You made your bed; go lie in it. Better <br/>\n safe than sorry.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nQuick example: We made a bad business decision (Ben tried to run a  <br/>\nnot-for-profit sports festival. Not-for-profit is JUST THAT!). Major financial  <br/>\nset-back. Bankruptcy court. Ben asked his family for some money to buy groceries  and <br/>\nto pay for electricity----his father said, &quot;Go get a job. You shouldn&#39;t have  <br/>\ntried something so stupid. You&#39;re an adult. Act like it.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nNeedless to say, we&#39;ve never asked him for money since. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMy father, on the other hand, kept slipping me $100 bills. Offered to buy  <br/>\nthe boys clothes. Paid our mortgage, more than once. WAS Santa Claus that  <br/>\nChristmas.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI have no fears to try different things because I KNOW that, if I fail, I  <br/>\nwon&#39;t become a bag lady. I&#39;ve always had a life-line, a safety-net. I always  <br/>\nfelt that I could TRY anything. And I have! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nSmall successes as a child---and small failures, with that  life-line----have <br/>\ntaught me that I can do anything. (Daddy always told me THAT  too!)  I think <br/>\nthat, if our children know that we are  their safety-nets should anything go <br/>\nbad, they will become more eager  to attempt what others think is impossible!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"What have you learned &quot;other ways&quot;?","postDate":"1086721777","msgId":95452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2LjUwY2ZkMGFlLjJkZjc2OGYxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":95455,"prevInTime":95451,"nextInTime":95453,"topicId":95452,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What are some things you ve learned entirely outside of school?
