A Friday Funny for you....<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Why did the chicken cross the road?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PAT BUCHANAN<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; JERRY FALWELL<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the chicken was gay!  Isn&#39;t it obvious?  Can&#39;t you people<br/>\n&gt;see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;other side.&quot;  That&#39;s what &quot;they&quot; call it-the &quot;other side.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;Yes,<br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friends, that chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you<br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out<br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly<br/>\n&gt;harmless<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phrases like &quot;the other side.&quot;  That chicken should not be free to<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;cross<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the road.  It&#39;s as plain and simple as that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DR. SEUSS-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did the chicken cross the road?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did he cross it with a toad?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes!  The chicken crossed the road,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but why it crossed, I&#39;ve not been told!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ERNEST HEMINGWAY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To die.
