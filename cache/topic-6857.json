With these headaches I have realized that I couldn&#39;t even<br/>\nthink about back tracking and looking at the whole picture  because my<br/>\nhead hurt so bad.<br/>\nAfter the meds took the headache back some, and I read more about<br/>\nmigraines though I was able to see a pattern of life that leads me to<br/>\nbelieve that there is a problem somewhere with seratonin levels in my<br/>\nbrain.  I seem to have all the consequences of this.<br/>\nSo, and antidepressant, like Zoloft, prevents seratonin from being lost<br/>\nwhere it is not used my brain.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I agree with your statement below about antidepressants,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m not sure I really understood what you were saying..  I know that<br/>\nZoloft doesn&#39;t replace seratonin, but cuts off the uptake of seratonin<br/>\nin ones brain.<br/>\nAm I misunderstanding?<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that we take in....One last note on antidepressants....they<br/>\n&gt; release =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain chemicals in the brain that allow someone to feel better,<br/>\n&gt; please<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remember that these are naturally occuring chemicals that are<br/>\n&gt; already in<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the brain..their ability to be released at the appropriate time<br/>\n&gt; has been<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somehow cut-off..what is the most common factor to cut off the<br/>\n&gt; brain&#39;s =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ability to release the chemicals naturally????drugs that make the<br/>\n&gt; brain<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dependant to release them...in other words  things such as =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; antidepressants.

migraine=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems..going even to the extremists extent and going to pain =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; management where=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they prescribe....highly addictive narcotics...like Morphine,<br/>\n&gt; which does<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; damage to her in the long run, than the migraines limit her...and<br/>\n&gt; being<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fetal position in severe pain..does sometimes cause one to be =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; depressed....and=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moody.&nbsp; What I have found is that western medicine tends to<br/>\n&gt; mask =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; initiator problem, and then causes more&nbsp; problems , having<br/>\n&gt; many =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; side=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effects, and long term effects that they are not aware of, because<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s not=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what they were testing for... with these new mangled<br/>\n&gt; fangled....miracle=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cures...rather than look for or find the root problem of the =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; migraines...they=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; treat the symptom, never touching the actual<br/>\n&gt; problem........therefor =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; healing=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never takes place, only part time relief..and as with<br/>\n&gt; anything.....like<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; natural flow of energy...there is ebb and flow..ebb &amp;<br/>\n&gt; flow..a=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; motion......when you hold something that is in motion on a steady<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; keel..it may=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not show any symptons...but is nature is still in motion..you can<br/>\n&gt; not =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hold it=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forever..eventually it will begin motion again..either making a<br/>\n&gt; higher =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ebb or=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeper flow......more or less severe migraines.....but you can not<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hold=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something in limbo forever......and when I&#39;m looking at or facing<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disease....I=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; begin with the cause...if I can..or I begin with the symtom and<br/>\n&gt; work my<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way back=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the cause....there are various natural&nbsp;remedies, known to<br/>\n&gt; =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do&nbsp;little=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or no harm to&nbsp;the body ...and when something is in it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;

=<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you....but the=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process educates, and allows you to take part in your health care,<br/>\n&gt; and =<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know more=20<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;
