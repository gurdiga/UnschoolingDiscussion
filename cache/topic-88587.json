Kids are fun, I will miss mine <br/>\nwhen they are all grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe no fear thing struck a cord, I have been criticized because our kids have <br/>\nno fear of us. It&#39;s often thought of as a fault, that&#39;s too bad. I can see <br/>\nthat DH and I have been living the un-something lifestyle long before we got the <br/>\nunschooling part right, LOL. I can&#39;t remember that last time I cared what <br/>\nanyone ate and DH got over it pretty quick too. I cook when I feel like it, there <br/>\nis always food here, we eat out now and then but people here can eat what <br/>\nthey would like and when they would like. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure it was a bit different here when I had very young kids but that has <br/>\nbeen a while and food has not been an issue here for a while. (Well, except <br/>\nthe other day when the 16yro locked the 20yro out for eating the leftover <br/>\npizza, LOL. )<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did go through a period of dad complaining that no one goes to bed here <br/>\nbut that has worked out too. Sometimes we stay up late but usually we all are in <br/>\nbed by midnight. Sometimes the 12yro watches his own TV later and the 16yro <br/>\nmay be on the computer later but as long as dad can sleep it&#39;s ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone helps out...usually. The 16yro likes to barter, I will sweep and mop <br/>\nif you will drive me to ...... or for some extra cash as we don&#39;t give <br/>\nallowances but we will give them money if they need it. It&#39;s not been an issue so <br/>\nfar. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been interesting reading, I had never thought about how we live, I can <br/>\nsee we&#39;re pretty relaxed and yet we are very involved. We drive more than any <br/>\nof the kids schooled friends parents. Just observations.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88541,"nextTopicId":88515}}
