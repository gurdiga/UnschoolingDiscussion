They differ in <br/>\ntheir emphases, priorities and interpretations.  I grew up learning why Baptists <br/>\nhave chosen to ignore big chunks of the Bible because there&#39;s a new covenant <br/>\nnow, yet plucking chosen bits and pieces out of &quot;the old covenant&quot; when it suits <br/>\ntheir purposes to do so.  Same with every splinter group.  And the &quot;main <br/>\ngroups&quot;: LDS, Roman Catholic Church, whichever monasteries are oldest--have all <br/>\naugmented their basic beliefs with later revelations and executive decisions and <br/>\ninterpretations and traditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the way it works with people.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo arguing dogma in relationship to a movie is like arguing whether a piece <br/>\nof art is appropriate for one church or another.  Each small group will decide. <br/>\n Clean empty cross is what the Baptists have.  Bloody messy cross, Catholics. <br/>\n Others might have a drape or a heart or a pattern but they decide what fits <br/>\ntheir iconography.<br/>\n<br/>\nMel Gibson had enough money to make a piece of art.  It&#39;s not Catholic art, <br/>\nit&#39;s Mel Gibson art.   Take it or leave it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question was about sending kids, and I think the decision&#39;s been made, <br/>\nright?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone know of any great websites where this moviehanks to those who turned <br/>\nit back toward unschooling!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91639,"nextTopicId":91654}}
