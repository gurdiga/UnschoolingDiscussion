Tickets  are usually <br/>\n$45, and you can get them today for $20 each. <br/>\n <br/>\nGroupon is a collective buying group, offering great discounts on cool  <br/>\nthings. (They also write the funniest descriptions I&#39;ve ever seen.) If you want <br/>\n tickets, you have until midnight tonight (Thursday) to get them.
