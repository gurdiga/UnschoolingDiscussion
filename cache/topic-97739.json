C has <br/>\nalways been a willing student, eager to do whatever asked of her. <br/>\nStill, we decided that she thrives when allowed to follow her <br/>\nparticular fascinations (of which she has many).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the school year of 2003-2004, C spent her time in the following ways:<br/>\n<br/>\nTV Viewing<br/>\nC is keenly interested in the construction of the situation-comedy. She <br/>\ncan be heard throughout the house imitating her favorite characters and <br/>\nactors. She has been known to tell me what makes one show effective and <br/>\nwhat makes another trite or predictable. She is able to identify <br/>\nstereotypical characters, caricature and bad dialog. She also has <br/>\ndeveloped an unbelievable vocabulary that I can only attribute to TV. <br/>\nShe�s really clever with irony and puns. One of my favorite comments of <br/>\nhers: �All the Disney villains are so predictable.� She went on to <br/>\nelucidate the qualities that make a Disney villain.  Go C!<br/>\n<br/>\nBird Watching<br/>\nC loved watching birds with us this year. She has learned to identify <br/>\nmost backyard birds and helped with recording which ones visited the <br/>\nfeeder. She also helped us stock the feeder with seed.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading and Language Arts<br/>\nC is learning to read. She is still working on the phonics of reading <br/>\nand has made lots of progress, though she still isn�t reading fluently. <br/>\n  We�ve used some workbooks (Explode the Code) because she likes to <br/>\nwrite in them, but mostly learn phonetics using techniques shown to me <br/>\nby a reading specialist.  She loves to write and has filled oodles of <br/>\nnotebooks with letters and �writing� that is her own. She�s working <br/>\nthrough the Frog and Toad series right now reading a little bit each <br/>\nweek.<br/>\n<br/>\nI�ve read aloud to her from the Girls of Many Lands books (from <br/>\nAmerican Girl) and we�ve enjoyed creating question and answer games for <br/>\nthose. She easily narrates the contents when asked about the stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite moments came when she set up her five dolls on a <br/>\nspecially designed, tiered stand. She put the English doll in the <br/>\nmiddle and at first had the Indian (India) doll next to her. C <br/>\nexclaimed: �Wait. I can�t put the India doll next to England. They hate <br/>\neach other.� She began to remind me of the conflicts between India and <br/>\nEngland that we had read about in the book. Then she had to decide who <br/>\ncould be next to England since China and France also had histories with <br/>\nthe British that included war.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe enjoys a wide variety of literature and we read aloud every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also participated in our language games that produced limericks and <br/>\nscrounged poetry. She loves to read and learn poems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read the last three Harry Potter books aloud to the kids during our <br/>\nread aloud times in addition to reading poetry. And we make nearly <br/>\nweekly library visits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn co-op, she studied the Beatrix Potter books and created several <br/>\nprojects that detailed BP�s work. She easily narrated to me what she <br/>\nlearned and what she enjoyed. She also took �Let�s Read and Write.�<br/>\n<br/>\nMath<br/>\nFor math, we took an eclectic approach. C did do some of the Miquon <br/>\nmath books I have for her and Jon bought her two traditional math books <br/>\nfrom the supermarket. But C finds the abstract concepts harder to grasp <br/>\nthat way so we use them only intermittently (she likes writing in <br/>\n�official books� but they often hinder more than help). More often, we <br/>\nused math books like: [I]Family Math[/I], [I]The I Hate Mathematics <br/>\nBook[/I] and other resources from the library. We also used the <br/>\nInternet for creative math ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral games helped to reinforce math concepts:<br/>\nMonopoly<br/>\nPoison<br/>\nDots<br/>\nYahtzee<br/>\nLentil Measuring<br/>\nManaging her money<br/>\nCounting games<br/>\n<br/>\nC is also endlessly fascinated with patterns. Currently she has an <br/>\nentire collection of cut outs from magazines that she pins to a <br/>\nbulletin board in endless arrangements based on their similarities and <br/>\ndifferences. She might put all the long skinny models in one corner and <br/>\nall the short square ones in another. Then she matches the �bling <br/>\nbling� (jewelry) to go with them based on color or shape or size.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe constantly organizes the house, her room and her belongings into <br/>\narrangements based on her need to see patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreek<br/>\nAmazingly, though C can�t yet read English fluently, she is fascinated <br/>\nby ancient Greek and has learned the alphabet. We�ve worked on both <br/>\nlower case and upper case letters as well as knowing how to pronounce <br/>\nthe names of the letters. She has her own Greek notebook and keeps a <br/>\nlist of our names written in Greek. We sometimes spend several days in <br/>\na row working on Greek and then take some time off. She�s always <br/>\ninterested in doing more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSports<br/>\nC played soccer in both fall and spring. And she took gym during co-op. <br/>\nShe swims at the YMCA and she danced this summer in a ballet five-week <br/>\nworkshop as well. One thing I like about C and sports is that she is <br/>\nhighly motivated to practice at home. We play soccer in the backyard <br/>\nand she loves to dance in the living room using books from the library <br/>\nto guide her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory/Geography<br/>\nThe American Girl books from India, China, and Turkey were our primary <br/>\nresources for history this year. We learned about the Indian revolt <br/>\nagainst Britain (1939), the Opium War in Canton (1857), and we studied <br/>\nlife in a harem in Turkey (1720).<br/>\n<br/>\nC turned her knowledge into a card game making questions and answers <br/>\nfor the details of the books. She played with the dolls as well as <br/>\nidentified the places mentioned in the books on the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched �Bend It Like Beckham� many, many times too.  That movie <br/>\ncombined her love of Britain, soccer and India.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe participated in our geography work from �Map the World by Heart.� <br/>\nShe learned about longitude and latitude as well as flags. She tasted <br/>\nChinese food for the first time this year as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe read several chapters from Story of the World and took time to read <br/>\nstories from 1001 Arabian nights. The kids loved these. We did several <br/>\nof the projects that are a part of SOTW including a Roman banner, <br/>\nChinese lanterns and clay pots. We also looked at maps.<br/>\n<br/>\nArt<br/>\nC loves art so we watched the Sister Wendy video series again. We <br/>\nvisited the art museum many times and she took art at the co-op. She�s <br/>\nprolific with design type drawings preferring them to portraits and <br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nFilms/TV<br/>\n�Pride and Prejudice�<br/>\n�Lord of the Rings: Return of the King� (and a repeat of the whole <br/>\ntrilogy including hours and hours and hours of behind the scenes <br/>\nmaterial about film making, script writing etc.)<br/>\n�Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban�<br/>\n�Newsies� (musical about the history of newspapers in the late 1800s in <br/>\nNYC)<br/>\n�Tornadoes� � History of tornadoes<br/>\n�Sinbad� � she loves mythology so we had fun with this since it related <br/>\nto our reading of the 1001 Arabian Nights.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97730,"nextTopicId":97743}}
