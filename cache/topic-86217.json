Because once <br/>\nyou commit it&#39;s stay for life or be shunned.   So at 16 kids go out and be <br/>\nwhile a while (or they stay and be wild, partying and drinking in the barn at <br/>\nnight).   It was sad, and too rough to watch with little kids (drug situation and <br/>\nbad language), but it was another instance of people basing their lives on <br/>\nsomething besides the inherent value and goodness of people, and the extreme <br/>\neffect it has on anyone who can&#39;t relax and fit in.  Yet one of the details was <br/>\nthat nearly 90% come back and join the church--the highest figure since the <br/>\nreligion was established in the late 1600s.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey live on this earth to earn a place in Heaven.
