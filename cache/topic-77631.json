Children use going into the street as a near-perfect way <br/>\nto gain parents&#39; attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there is a promising new educational intervention program, called <br/>\nSafe Playing.  The underlying principles of the program are simple:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Define safe boundaries in a POSITIVE way.  &#39;Safe players play on the <br/>\ngrass or sidewalk.&#39;<br/>\n2. Give stickers for safe play.  That makes it more fun than playing <br/>\ndangerously.<br/>\n3. Praise your child for safe play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese three principles have an almost instant effect on  increasing <br/>\nsafe play.

During the recent<br/>\nDefense of Spanking thing, the original poster tried to use<br/>\npseudo-intellectual reasoning about how it was necessary and the choice<br/>\nwas either that or her child be hit by a car, while other posters were<br/>\nfocusing on the emotional responses a child might have to being hit and<br/>\nhumiliated in public. She couldn&#39;t acknowledge that at all, she couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndeal with the emotional impact of what she had done so she ignored it and<br/>\npretended it didn&#39;t exist, or that it was necessary and therefore<br/>\nunworthy of comment. I can&#39;t think of any way to get through to someone<br/>\nin that place except getting her to acknowledge those emotions, but<br/>\nacknowledging those emotions in her child would have meant admitting to<br/>\nherself that she has caused them, and she wasn&#39;t willing to do that yet.<br/>\nIt takes a lot of courage, to face up to your mistakes as a parent. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose there are two ways to deal with someone like that. You can be<br/>\nnon-confrontive, and suppport the good things they&#39;re doing, and hope<br/>\nthat eventually the person is able to see past their blockage. In a one<br/>\nto one situation with someone who doesn&#39;t seem real ready to change, that<br/>\nwould seem like a good option. On a huge email list, though, where the<br/>\npoint of the list is to help hundreds of people get somewhere, not just<br/>\none person, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s feasible. If ideas contrary to the point<br/>\nof the list are left out there, unchallenged, then it changes the point<br/>\nof the list and waters it down, and that&#39;s not fair to the hundreds of<br/>\nother people on the list. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think learning about unschooling is the goal here, rather than peace. <br/>\nI&#39;d prefer to have respectful, fruitful discussions, because it&#39;s a lot<br/>\nmore pleasant, but if I have to chose between some strife and<br/>\n&quot;Unschooling-lite&quot;, I would chose the former...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2006689,"authorName":"Paradox","from":"&quot;Paradox&quot; &lt;paradox@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Emotion vs Intellect","postDate":"1059151985","msgId":77674,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWMzNTM5YSQyMTk2YjYyMCRhOWE4ODdkOUBwYXJhZG94Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFjZC5lNDI0NTI3LjJjNTE2ZWRlQGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDAzMDFjMzUyYzQkYzEyOThmZTAkZTQ2ZTZjMThAZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":77667,"nextInTopic":77693,"prevInTime":77673,"nextInTime":77675,"topicId":77631,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
