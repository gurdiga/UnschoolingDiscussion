One state now says no, you can&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt;that. In fact - if you do - you could get arrested. Who should<br/>\n&gt;control your children&#39;s education you or the state?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;William Longenese (spelling?) reports. You decide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(narrator) It&#39;s back to school for the Andersons. Only this year the<br/>\n&gt;state considers their teacher a felon. The crime? Their mother<br/>\n&gt;schools Stan and Katie at home - without a teaching credential.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Homeschool Mom - Thurleen Anderson) )  &quot;I decided that I could do<br/>\n&gt;better. We also are very committed to raising our children to be<br/>\n&gt;leaders.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Calif. Education Department Deputy Superintendent Scott Hill) &quot;In<br/>\n&gt;the eyes of the department there is no way to read the law but to say<br/>\n&gt;that that&#39;s not an authorized education for those children.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Mike Smith - Home School Legal Defense) &quot;Well that&#39;s their opinion,<br/>\n&gt;and we say they&#39;re wrong.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(narrator) More than a million children nationwide are homeschooled<br/>\n&gt;With enrollment grow 15% per a year, some fear public education may<br/>\n&gt;suffer. Last month California did something about it - issuing this<br/>\n&gt;statewide directive. &quot;In California homeschooling, a situation where<br/>\n&gt;noncredentialed parents teach their own children.. is not an<br/>\n&gt;authorized exemption from mandatory public school attendance.  <br/>\n&gt;Therefore parents who homeschool their children are operating outside<br/>\n&gt;the law.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Mike Smith - Home School Legal Defense)  &quot;Perhaps this is an effort<br/>\n&gt;to scare people not to remove their child from public school. They<br/>\n&gt;are telling them it&#39;s illegal for most of them unless they are a<br/>\n&gt;certified teacher.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(Calif. Education Department Deputy Superintendent Scott Hill)  &quot;The<br/>\n&gt;law is very clear kids must be educated. There&#39;s a compulsorily<br/>\n&gt;education law in California. Kids are required to go to school. They<br/>\n&gt;are require to learn our state content standards. That is the law.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;(narrator) It is now up to the local districts to enforce truancy<br/>\n&gt;statutes and while many won&#39;t bother. One&#39;s already going door to<br/>\n&gt;door looking for kids who are homeschooled. Then it&#39;s up to a local<br/>\n&gt;DA to prosecute parents - not because they can&#39;t teach, but because<br/>\n&gt;they don&#39;t carry a teaching credential.<br/>\n&gt;* * * *<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m wondering if flooding the California Department of Education with<br/>\n&gt;an email campaign would help the homeschoolers in California. The<br/>\n&gt;HSLDA asked for email to go to Germany several years ago, and that<br/>\n&gt;was supposed to have been effective.
