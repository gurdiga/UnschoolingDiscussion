You could sound one out for him.  With <br/>\n&quot;digital,&quot; I would have said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a hard word.  &quot;g&quot; is usually hard, like <br/>\n&quot;dig&quot; in English, but this one is from the word &quot;digit&quot; that means finger.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s from Latin or Greek word parts.  &quot;Digital&quot; just has to do with counting <br/>\nand numbers, and people count on their fingers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told TONS of stories like that to kids learning to read.  For one thing, <br/>\nit&#39;s distracting (in a good way) and it shows WHY English is so inconsistent.   <br/>\nIt trades them a COOL piece of knowledge for their sad frustration in not <br/>\nreading a word they might never even have heard or seen before.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Walmart on Monday Holly said there are words with &quot;th&quot; in the middle which <br/>\nare NOT &quot;th&quot; words.   &quot;Foothills&quot; and &quot;Sweetheart.&quot;    We talked about how <br/>\nhard that must be to read for kids who are looking for phonics blends they have <br/>\nlearned, instead of looking at the words themselves to see what they seem to <br/>\nbe made of.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhonics says to work from front to end, sounding out.    But if a child is <br/>\nlooking at the whole word and seeing FIRST whether it&#39;s something sensible he <br/>\nrecognizes in context, he will see those two for the English compound words they <br/>\nare, broken between the t and the h.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple English one-syllable words are the most commonly used in English.   <br/>\nThere are tons of the longer words we have from French, Latin and Greek, but <br/>\nthey&#39;re not the bulk of everyday speech and writing.  They&#39;re the bulk of the <br/>\ndictionary, but that&#39;s a different way to count.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the more words he knows from watching movies, singing songs, talking, <br/>\nplaying video games, etc., the easier it will be for him to recognize those <br/>\nwords when his reading ability DOES kick in.  Holly had a huge vocabulary <br/>\nbefore she could read, so she would as easily have been able to read &quot;vocabulary&quot; <br/>\nas &quot;words.&quot;  When it made sense to her, it made sense.   What would have been <br/>\ndifficult for her in the few sentences above would be &quot;huge&quot; and &quot;singing&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;does.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And then, with prompting on my part, he read the rest of the joke with <br/>\nease.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPrompting might not be as helpful as just reading it to him and letting him <br/>\nthink &quot;I knew that,&quot; if he did.

Will he ever become a reader if he thinks he is not, or can&#39;t be, or, maybe even never will be able to become a reader?<br/>\n<br/>\nHey Kelly,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking more about this, and I really think the best thing to do is back off completely. I know a big part of your concern is J being down on himself and believing that he &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do it--far more than you&#39;re worried about the act of reading itself. But I think at this point any kind of &quot;encouragement&quot; however hands-off and well-meaning is going to reinforce his attitude of &quot;they want me to be able to do this, but I just can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reflecting on this in terms of Emily, who had only about 3 weeks of daily practice &quot;encouraged&quot; on her. It was turning so incredibly negative. Once we completely, and I mean completely, backed off, she began to do things on her own terms. At first she just didn&#39;t do anything at all, but then she started reading little things like boxes, signs, video titles. She built up her confidence in her own way and on her own terms and started thinking to herself, &quot;hey, I can do this!&quot; Gradually, she went back to the Clifford readers, which dh and I had decided were &quot;too easy&quot; for her and had &quot;encouraged&quot; her to move away from. She would read 2 or 3 at a time and reinforce the confidence that she was rebuilding on her own, now that we&#39;d finally stopped interfering with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the other night she read 4 in a row while snuggling in bed with me--I was just keeping my mouth shut! I&#39;m still disappointed with myself because she&#39;ll look up at me periodically, asking with her eyes &quot;am I getting this right?&quot; I&#39;m just smiling at her and listening, maybe a wink or a rub periodically, but I&#39;m trying to be way hands off. After the 4th book was done, she yawned and said, &quot;I am getting *so* good at reading! I&#39;m going to bed now, mama. I love you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily is beginning to own the reading for herself, which is what is reversing the &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; attitude. Yes, damage has already been done. I think it&#39;s minimal, and I&#39;m very grateful to have come to my senses sooner rather than later. But I really believe that the only reason she&#39;s changing her attitude is because I have dropped any efforts to encourage. I quietly support by being there to listen when she&#39;s ready to read, but that&#39;s it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWatching her read on her own terms without any involvement from us was really dh&#39;s turning point on unschooling. While he had been generally supportive of it, he was hanging onto the whole math and reading thing. Now, he&#39;s seeing how unschooling works in action, and he&#39;s really impressed. I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ll revisit his concerns periodically, and I feel bad that Emily will take the brunt of it all as the oldest. But now, I have a success story to remind him about. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135843572,"authorName":"24hrmom","from":"&quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;24hrmom@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] worry about pessimism?","postDate":"1074087509","msgId":88828,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzYzcwMWMzZGFhMyRiMjgzMjc1MCQwMjAwYThjMEBUaW5rZXJiZWxsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDZmLjQwYTFjMWVmLjJkMzVjNGM1QGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDA2MDFjM2RhMjkkYzE3MTA2MzAkMTYwMmE4YzBAUzAwMjYyOTI5MjA+"},"prevInTopic":88789,"nextInTopic":88842,"prevInTime":88827,"nextInTime":88829,"topicId":88766,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1043642968\">&lt;&lt;But his initial attitude was &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;  Is there any way that I can help him with this attitude?

My daughter went through the &quot;I can&#39;t read&quot; stage after she left school (she was almost 8).  What I did was to remove any pressure she felt.  I knew she *could* read, technically, but obviously she had no such confidence.  So I did not ask her to sound anything out; I just read whatever she asked.  I did point out to her once in a while when she was reading a word here and there ... see you can read, you just haven&#39;t meet all the words yet (and I mentioned how I sometimes come across new words as well - nobody knows them all!).  I would get books from the library that I thought she might like and left them lying around.  And I read stories to the kids.  This lasted just over a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it ended up that the kids loved the Harry Potter books and I read them over and over.  We eventually got the audiobooks and she listened to them almost constantly in her room.  Last fall she started picking up the books to look up various passages and found she wasn&#39;t as intimidated as before.  Soon she read the first HP book (and her first book) on her own in 3-4 days.  And now she&#39;s branched out to &quot;The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter&quot; and various other things.  In fact, a few weeks ago she announced in mock horror &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m turning into a bookworm!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that your son does not enjoy being read to, so maybe you can bring the words to him in a different way.  I know my eldest learned to enjoy the written word through video game guides and magazines.  Does your son have an interest that maybe you could get a magazine subscription for?  Especially if the magazine has wonderful pictures in it as well.  He can get info through the pictures to start and his interest may lead him to start reading the captions and eventually the articles.  For now, you can do any reading he wants from it for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147376218,"authorName":"liza sabater","from":"liza sabater &lt;listdiva@...&gt;","profile":"lm_sabater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] worry about pessimism?","postDate":"1074050759","msgId":88789,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVGOUREQ0M4LTQ2NDEtMTFEOC1BMjEyLTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTE0MDI0Ni5pMEUyazVRSDAwNzEzN0Btcy1zbXRwLTAzLWVyaTAub2hpb3JkYy5yci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":88783,"nextInTopic":88828,"prevInTime":88788,"nextInTime":88790,"topicId":88766,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... i think you already did. you asked him if it was the one word. evan is like that as well. he will say, i can t do it for the drama effect. then i will","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-876047733\">On Tuesday, January 13, 2004, at 09:47  PM, Marjorie Kirk wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there any way that I can help<br/>\n&gt; him with this attitude?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>i think you already did. you asked him if it was the one word.<br/>\n<br/>\nevan is like that as well. he will say, &quot;i can&#39;t do it&quot; for the drama <br/>\neffect. then i will ask, which word can&#39;t you do. he&#39;ll point to it and <br/>\nthe drama is all gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nl i z a<br/>\n=========================<br/>\nwww.culturekitchen.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":42924764,"authorName":"Marjorie Kirk","from":"&quot;Marjorie Kirk&quot; &lt;mkirk@...&gt;","profile":"mdlfkirk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] worry about pessimism?","postDate":"1074048457","msgId":88783,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTE0MDI0Ni5pMEUyazVRSDAwNzEzN0Btcy1zbXRwLTAzLWVyaTAub2hpb3JkYy5yci5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWMzZGEyOSRjMTcxMDYzMCQxNjAyYThjMEBTMDAyNjI5MjkyMD4="},"prevInTopic":88773,"nextInTopic":88789,"prevInTime":88782,"nextInTime":88784,"topicId":88766,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For instance, today he brought a popsicle stick to me with a joke on it and said, I can t read this.

My oldest is Sarah, who is nearly 8 years old. She has a diagnosis of ADHD, quite possibly has mild Asberger&#39;s (sp?!) but we decided not to pursue testing for it. Next I have Logan, who is nearly 4. As far as we can tell at this point he is NT. Megan is 2 1/2, and has some developmental delays that may or may not be related to possible PDD-NOS but we&#39;re not pursuing a diagnosis there either. Gracie is 5 months old, and so far also seems NT. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ve kept Sarah home since the end of Kindergarten, nearly 2 years now. While she figured out that she &quot;could&quot; read during the first couple months of &quot;first grade&quot; she has only really begun to read since about last October. She, too, had a very pessimistic attitude towards reading. She is primarily an auditory learner, and visual things seem to be a weak spot for her. Mostly, we just kept reading to her and telling her that she COULD read. After about a year of having the technical knowledge but not really interest, she became interested in reading and will now read some. Like I said though she is primarily an auditory person so I don&#39;t expect her to ever become a &quot;reader&quot; like I am...I &quot;devour&quot; books. I continue to encourage her to read for fun, and listen as she reads when she wants to read aloud, which gives me the opportunity to see that her skills are improving. I just do my best though to understand that reading may never be her primary source for information or a favorite<br/>\n &quot;fun&quot; activity.<br/>\n <br/>\nRight now though, your son may just need you to continue to not make a big deal out of his reading or seeming lack of it. Keep interesting things around that he might like to read, especially if they are full of pictures and just be available. I think he&#39;ll do just fine eventually!<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apmomto4@...\">apmomto4@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI have learned so much from this list!
