I&#39;ve <br/>\ntried to explain to others who have expressed concerns over our <br/>\nmethods that blind obedience is not, and never has been, our goal.  <br/>\nWhen my husband or I are being unreasonable, my older son (who is 6 <br/>\n1/2) has no problem asking &quot;why,&quot; and often it is his fresh question <br/>\nthat will make me think, &quot;Now why am I asking him to do this?  Do I <br/>\nhave a reason or am I just issuing orders?&quot;  I try to treat them like <br/>\nI&#39;d like to be treated, which is with courtesy and respect, and I <br/>\nhave to say, they respond very positively to this.  Anyhow, I love <br/>\nyour Mother&#39;s Day story, and I imagine you&#39;ll remember this one for a <br/>\nlong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tracey Inman <br/>\n&lt;traceyinman@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are new unschoolers and I have had my share of &quot;is this really <br/>\n </span></blockquote>going work&quot; thoughts since January.

Our family who came for <br/>\nmother&#39;s day lunch got all excited and my cousins who are a bit <br/>\nyounger than I am were taking pictures for school.  Rachael got upset <br/>\nwhen the other minnows starting eating the babies so she seperated <br/>\nthe mom and babies.  The poor mother gave birth for 8 hours (somthing <br/>\nlike 50 babies) and finally died.  Rachael pushed the last two babies <br/>\nout of her.  My dh and I were amazed at the knowledge Rachael was <br/>\nspouting out to us during all of this.   As I was taking pictures and <br/>\nhaving a grand time. I kept thinking to myself and occasionally said <br/>\nout loud for the benefit of those not understanding why we do what we <br/>\ndo that this was not an event likely to happen in a classroom.  Since <br/>\nthe birth of the babies Rachael stayed on her mission to discover <br/>\nwhat kind of fish would give birth the live young.  And alas!
