You could walk 20 miles if you needed to.<br/>\nHealthy means being able to do anything a body your age should be<br/>\nable to do. It means not getting every cold that comes along. It<br/>\nmeans getting up every morning and feeling vital and alive. I heard a<br/>\nwoman, a healthy-looking woman, at the gym yesterday telling her<br/>\nfriend that every morning she had to have two cups of caffeine and<br/>\nthree ibuprofin or the stress she&#39;s under gives her a monster<br/>\nheadache. *every day*. That&#39;s not healthy. Out of a friend&#39;s 6<br/>\nsiblings (all in their 30&#39;s or early 40&#39;s), one has had a heart<br/>\nattack, two already have diabetes, all are out of shape and<br/>\noverweight. That&#39;s not healthy. But they&#39;re very typical Americans.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, we still have 7 here who fit your bill. IF, we get one cold a year, <br/>\nthat&#39;s a lot. Even my oldest who goes to school, never gets sick. Maybe once <br/>\nevery few years with a cold. And if we do get a bug, it&#39;s passed us in a few <br/>\ndays, really. As far as climbing a mountain, I wouldn&#39;t want to chance it as <br/>\nI&#39;ve had no training and that&#39;s not the kind of thing one just does. But <br/>\nwalking a mountain trail or something, no problem. And it&#39;s not something we <br/>\ndo, but we could if we had to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;How many of us could get up at 5:00 in the morning, milk three cows,<br/>\ncarry the pails of milk back to the house, churn the cream into<br/>\nbutter, split the firewood, walk 6 miles to town to get the supplies<br/>\nyou need to sew all the dresses for your family for the next year?<br/>\nThat&#39;s what my great-grandma did.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s pretty much what your great grandma had to do. I remember my grandma <br/>\nwalking all over the place well in her 70&#39;s when she was offered rides. She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t take them because that&#39;s not what she was use to. She walked <br/>\neverywhere and far too. If we had to live like that or wanted to, yes we <br/>\ncould do that too. It would be a matter of time and getting use to it, but <br/>\nour bodies could handle it I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as saying most people aren&#39;t healthy in this country, I would a gree <br/>\nthat a lot aren&#39;t.

I&#39;d say easily less than 1% of people I know <br/>\nor have met or seen are *healthy*. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe health club I used to go to did Body Age testing, where they <br/>\ntested your body fat, evaluated your diet, put you on a treadmill and <br/>\nramped it up until you fell apart, tested your VO2Max (oxygen use), <br/>\netc. and then they told you what your actual bodily age was - as <br/>\nopposed to the number of years you&#39;ve lived on the planet. <br/>\nSurprisingly, even most people who were tested there (people who had <br/>\nbothered to go to a health club and be active in the first place) had <br/>\na bodily age *above* their chronological age. Often well above.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say healthy means that if someone asked you to climb a mountain <br/>\ntomorrow, you could do it.

But overall, even people <br/>\nfree from diseases or afflictions or congenital problems are, for the <br/>\nmost part, not healthy. If Americans overall were healthy, the diet <br/>\nindustry wouldn&#39;t be a multi-billion dollar industry, there wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe an entire 50-foot-long aisle in the supermarket filled with <br/>\nantacids, cold remedies, aspirin, ibuprofen, acetominophen, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of us could get up at 5:00 in the morning, milk three cows, <br/>\ncarry the pails of milk back to the house, churn the cream into <br/>\nbutter, split the firewood, walk 6 miles to town to get the supplies <br/>\nyou need to sew all the dresses for your family for the next year? <br/>\nThat&#39;s what my great-grandma did. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d guess that my definition of healthy is maybe more rigorous than <br/>\nwhat many people consider healthy.
