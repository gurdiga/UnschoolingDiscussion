Sorry. :( I don&#39;t  know what I did wrong. But<br/>\nanyway, you can find the game at Walmart and probably<br/>\nother places. I admire my son because he doesn&#39;t<br/>\naccept gifts of slaves from other rulers, even though<br/>\nthe slaves would save him money on labor. He knows<br/>\nit&#39;s just a game, but the idea of owning even pretend<br/>\nslaves is abhorrent to him. *sniff* I&#39;m so proud! :)<br/>\nIn this series, there are also games of Zeus, King<br/>\nArthur, Cleopatra, etc. We&#39;re all hoping a Queen<br/>\nElizabeth I game will come out sooner or later.
