I&#39;m not sure what you mean exactly here.<br/>\n<br/>\n***and relaxing and getting enough sleep, among other<br/>\nthings.***<br/>\n<br/>\nA good book interferes with my getting enough sleep more than tv ever does.  I won&#39;t be swearing off books any time soon though.  Lately what&#39;s been interfering with my sleep the most is our new puppy, but I&#39;m still glad to have him.<br/>\n<br/>\n***The other thing I hated about television was that<br/>\nwhen we did have it, it was too easy for me to use it as a babysitter.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI always find this to be a curious comment even though it&#39;s one I used to make myself.  If your child is, say, watching a video while you make dinner you might say you are &quot;using the tv as a babysitter&quot; but would you say the same thing for other activities the child enjoys that keep him happily occupied while you attend to something else?  I&#39;m very guilty then of using the bathtub as a babysitter since my usual solution for keeping my three year old occupied when I need him to be is to fill up the bathtub with water and toys.  Playdough also makes a good babysitter in my house.<br/>\n<br/>\n***get them excited about compulsory schooling, distract them<br/>\nfrom what the world is REALLY like-- make them think it is always<br/>\nhappy, with bright, primary colours, and animals that smile and talk<br/>\nand also go to school.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you&#39;re giving kids enough credit for realizing that talking animals and such are pure fantasy and happen only on tv and in books.  My children have all loved various tv shows with talking animals and I have yet to have a child surprised when a *real* animal doesn&#39;t talk, dance, or sing.<br/>\n<br/>\n***TV is not a waterfall, it is not a<br/>\nflock of geese, it is not a replacement for an actual sensorial<br/>\nexperience of nature.***<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither are a lot of other things in our lives, including the computer you&#39;re sitting at.  <br/>\nI want my children to have waterfalls, flocks of geese, sensorial experience of nature *and* tv.  It doesn&#39;t have to be either or.  Really. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61898,"nextTopicId":61253}}
