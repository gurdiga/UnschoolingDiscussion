(I told him that we probably weren&#39;t typical with 3 desktops, a<br/>\nlaptop and a handheld all on a 100MBPS network, all with internet access and<br/>\nindividual e-mail accounts for the kids)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Has the Net convinced parents to embrace homeschooling and why?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- How do parents and children communicate using the Net: to what extent do<br/>\nthey use chat, message boards, email etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- What does that mean for the contested issue of socialization through<br/>\nhomeschooling vs. attending a regular school?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Economic factors: Does the Internet help make homeschooling most<br/>\ncost-efficient or do families tend to buy/outsource more teaching in terms<br/>\nof<br/>\nbuying curriculum packages etc, online, signing their children up for<br/>\ndistance-learning schools etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to help with this article, you can send your responses to<br/>\nSteffan by June 28.
