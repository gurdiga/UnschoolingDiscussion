It was a pretty agonizing <br/>\ndecision, because his father lives in cincinnati, and moving meant he <br/>\nwould not see his father every day like he was used to. I quit a job <br/>\nwhere i was making almost $30,000 a year (probably not a huge income <br/>\nto most people, but for me it was my first &quot;real&quot; job), gave up our <br/>\nthree-story house with tons of space (it was falling apart anyway), <br/>\nwe even had to leave our little dog with seamus&#39; father&#39;s mother. <br/>\nCincinnati had tons of stuff to do, great restaurants, bookstores, <br/>\nthe zoo, the aquarium, museums, tons of HSers, everything within 10 <br/>\nor 20 miles of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we live with my brother in his 2 bd apt, we have much less space <br/>\nand i have to deal with having a roommate again. I work for my mom, <br/>\ntaking care of her (disabled from a stroke)about four days a week. I <br/>\nhave to say, our lives are great...seamus and i are almost always <br/>\ntogether, he surrounded by complete love and acceptance from my <br/>\nmother, two sisters, two of my brothers who live close, and his very <br/>\nbest friend in the world, my 8 yr old niece. He didnt have that in <br/>\nCincy. He still sees his father every month. Its not the same though. <br/>\nWhen i moved down to Cincinnati when seamus was 3, i went through the <br/>\nsame agonizing decision (should he live near his father? Or my close <br/>\nfamily??) I am very happy with what i chose this time. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion is that having the memories of growing up having &quot;Sunday <br/>\ndinner at Grandma&#39;s house&quot; (which, like you, i did NOT have as a <br/>\nchild)is priceless. And if you actually like your family and get <br/>\nalong well, having that kind of supportive atmosphere around is also <br/>\ntotally worth the move. Much more important than money and museums.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142940964,"authorName":"Burton Bunch","from":"&quot;Burton Bunch&quot; &lt;livnrway@...&gt;","profile":"livnrway","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] moving back to the country","postDate":"1082040457","msgId":92619,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDIwMWM0MjJmOCQ5ZDk0OTI1MCRiN2FkYTUzZkBCdXJ0b25zYXRsYXN0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgwLjk3NmU3YzcuMmRhZjA0MzhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":92592,"nextInTopic":92637,"prevInTime":92618,"nextInTime":92620,"topicId":92592,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We moved from a large city to the country almost 8 years ago and have never regretted it.

Our extended family actually came to join US in the last 3<br/>\nyears.  While we may not have the museums, libraries, concert halls etc. at<br/>\nour back door (within a few hours drive if we feel the need for something<br/>\n&quot;bigger&quot;) there are so many other avenues to explore and things to do that<br/>\nenrich us everyday.  We discovered an old refurbished church that was turned<br/>\ninto an art center that hosts many intimate events..not on the grand scale<br/>\nof a large city but ones in which the kids can be right there involved in<br/>\nthe performance and asking questions etc.  For me it&#39;s all in how I choose<br/>\nto see where we are and why we are here.  In the city we were living a much<br/>\nmore limiting lifestyle than we ever have here --- we just have a real sense<br/>\nof freedom now that wasn&#39;t there before the move.   Life seems to move a bit<br/>\nslower here and I truly love that.
