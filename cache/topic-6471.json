It could never work.  You<br/>\nwould have to include everything from every faith to make it fair.  That&#39;s<br/>\nnot what they&#39;re there for. <br/>\n........<br/>\nFamilies must take the responsiblility to raise their own, each according<br/>\nto their personal beliefs.  We teach our own and also allow trusted Sunday<br/>\nschool teachers etc at our church to teach them.  Parents have given up on<br/>\nmolding and training their kids and just expect the school or the gov&#39;t to<br/>\ntake care of it.  Which is probably why this country is such a mess.<br/>\n  <br/>\nWhat do you guys think?<br/>\n  <br/>\nBetsy Wright<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m standing in my chair whisting and applauding Betsy, that&#39;s what I<br/>\nthink.  You hit the nail right on the head on both counts.  Religion in<br/>\nPublic schools is impossible, unrealistic and just plain wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the other, it is a symptom of the &quot;It&#39;s not MY fault!&quot; mentality to<br/>\nblame everyone BUT the parents for how the children turn out.  While<br/>\nparents cannot be held wholly responsible for the actions of their<br/>\nchildren, it is, as you said, the FAMILIES responsibility to teach<br/>\nmorality, value systems and to raise their children &quot;each according to<br/>\ntheir own personal beliefs.&quot;  And what tunnel visioned fool saw fit to<br/>\ncombine some of the concepts in the original post and equate them all with<br/>\nthe departure of Judeo-Christian worship from the public schools?  What a<br/>\ncrock of #&#%!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat message really chapped my hide, and I was surprised to see such a<br/>\nbigotted and narrow minded post on this, one of my most cherished lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6465,"nextTopicId":6484}}
