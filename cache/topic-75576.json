I have two <br/>\n&gt; grown unschoolers.  I have an almost 5-year-old that I would love to <br/>\n&gt; homeschool in the unschooling way, but I&#39;m a single mom and I have a <br/>\n&gt; job that I love now.  So, I&#39;ve been thinking about starting <br/>\n&gt; an &quot;unschool&quot; for my son and other children whose parents would like <br/>\n&gt; to homeschool, but cannot do so on their own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Has anyone else tried to do this?  Sudbury Valley Schools seem to be <br/>\n&gt; the closest, but I don&#39;t want to do anything that big and there are <br/>\n&gt; none in my area.  I just want to create an unschooling community <br/>\n&gt; learning center for a small number of children.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you have any suggestions, ideas, or warnings for me, let me know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sue <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My best friend&#39;s family has been involved in a Sudbury school near Hartford, <br/>\nCT (which is desperately looking for students, by the way, in case you know of <br/>\nanyone!), which started up last fall.  They would tell you it&#39;s the most <br/>\nwonderful and horrific thing they&#39;ve ever done. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s wonderful because they have a small group of kids who were sad that <br/>\nschool ended last week. Nick (my friend&#39;s son) is the happiest he&#39;s ever been. <br/>\nWhen my friend, Melissa, was talking about the school possibly having to close, <br/>\nher reaction to the possiblity of Nick&#39;s having to go back to public school (he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to homeschool) was &quot;When will he have time to learn anything?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe horrific part is that it&#39;s really HARD to start a school or program. (By <br/>\nthe way, apparently most of the Sudbury schools across the country, other than <br/>\nthe first, are small and always scraping by looking for students.) It&#39;s hard <br/>\nto find kids, it&#39;s hard to work out money issues, it&#39;s just hard!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like I can connect you with my friend and she&#39;ll be able to answer <br/>\nmore questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75575,"nextTopicId":75578}}
