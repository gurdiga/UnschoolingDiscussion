The administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while the public&#39;s attention is on the elections, so our action on this is needed immediately. <br/>\n<br/>\n      $28 million has been added to the 2004 Selective Service System (SSS) budget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as June 15, 2005. Selective Service must report to Bush on March 31, 2005 that the system, which has lain dormant for decades, is ready for activation. Please see website: www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html to view the sss annual performance plan - fiscal year 2004. <br/>\n<br/>\n      The pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 draft board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide.. Though this is an unpopular election year topic, military experts and influential members of congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld&#39;s prediction of a &quot;long, hard slog&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a permanent state of war on &quot;terrorism&quot;] proves accurate, the U.S. may have no choice but to draft. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and HR 163 forward this year, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/legislation/na...s89/default.asp\">http://www.hslda.org/legislation/na...s89/default.asp</a> entitled the Universal National Service Act of 2003, &quot;to provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.&quot; These active bills currently sit in the committee on armed services. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those from the Vietnam era. <br/>\n<br/>\n      College and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada and the U.S. signed a &quot;smart border declaration,&quot; which could be used to keep would-be draft dodgers in. Signed by Canada&#39;s minister of foreign affairs, John Manley, and U.S. Homeland Security director, Tom Ridge, the declaration involves a 30-point plan which implements, among other things, a &quot;pre-clearance agreement&quot; of people entering and departing each country. Reforms aimed at making the draft more equitable along gender and class lines also eliminates higher education as a shelter. Underclassmen would only be able to postpone service until the end of their current semester. Seniors would have until the end of the academic year. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Even those voters who currently support US actions abroad may still object to this move, knowing their own children or grandchildren will not have a say about whether to fight. Not that it should make a difference, but this plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as a <br/>\n      shelter and includes women in the draft. <br/>\n<br/>\n      The public has a right to air their opinions about such an important decision. <br/>\n<br/>\n      Please send this on to all the friends, parents, aunts and uncles, grandparents, and cousins that you know. Let your children know too -- it&#39;s their future, and they can be a powerful voice for change! <br/>\n<br/>\n      Please also contact your representatives to ask them why they aren&#39;t telling their constituents about these bills -- and contact newspapers and other media outlets to ask them why they&#39;re not covering this important story. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\nYour files are attached and ready to send with this message.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94756,"nextTopicId":94796}}
