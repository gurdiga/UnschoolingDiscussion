Persevere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe expectation that someone would be able to say these things and then <br/>\nthe kid would go &quot;Oh yeah&quot; is unrealistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re doing is building up credit - it takes a while. You get <br/>\ncredit for listening, for commenting appropriately, for being loving <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s not, for having good instincts about when to hug and when to <br/>\ngive space.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t a magic pill - to use these ideas. It doesn&#39;t work <br/>\ninstantaneously. At least not usually - although sometimes it does seem <br/>\nlike a miracle cure at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks ago, at our park day, a little girl came, crying, to <br/>\nher mom. Her brother was being mean, she said. In their pretend play, <br/>\nshe was his dog and she wanted to be named one thing and he said that <br/>\nwas a stupid name and told her she was named something else. Her mom <br/>\nheld her and hugged her while she cried and cried. She&#39;d gulp and <br/>\nbreathe and recover a little and look at her mom and say, &quot;Its not fair <br/>\nI WANT to be Penny and he won&#39;t LET me.&quot; And then cry some more. Mom <br/>\npatted her back gently. She&#39;d comment just a little, once in a while - <br/>\n&quot;You REALLY want to be Penny, huh.&quot; Stuff like that. At one point mom <br/>\nkind of repeated something the girl had been saying, &quot;He called the <br/>\nname you want to be stupid,&quot; The girl&#39;s crying got MUCh bigger and she <br/>\nsaid, &quot;He always thinks my  ideas are stupid because he&#39;s older and he <br/>\nthinks my ideas are for babies and.....on and on in a rush of <br/>\nresentment and upset all against her brother.&quot; Mom NEVER argued with <br/>\nher. Just hugged her while she got it ALL out. Said things once in a <br/>\nwhile like, &quot;Oh,&quot; or other equally sympathetic, but noncommittal, <br/>\nsounds. This took a LONG time - 20 minutes maybe. The son came over in <br/>\nthe middle of it - one of the other kids had tried to intervene, but he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t budging. Eventually the girl was done and ready to go play again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mom never got up and tried to intervene and force the boy to give <br/>\nin - even though I imagine it was really frustrating, considering how <br/>\nsilly the whole fuss seemed - who CARES what name your pretend pet dog <br/>\nchooses? Answer - both of these kids cared a lot - or maybe this wasn&#39;t <br/>\neven ABOUT that, really. Maybe he&#39;d been bossing her around for an hour <br/>\nand this was just the final straw OR maybe she&#39;d been refusing to go <br/>\nalong with any of HIS ideas for the previous hour. NO way could mom <br/>\nreally know. Neither kid wanted to work it out - neither wanted to talk <br/>\nabout it at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was SO impressed with this mom&#39;s patience. She built up HUGE credit <br/>\nwith her daughter - she was so there for her - so NOT impatient and <br/>\nwanting her to hurry up and get over it. She didn&#39;t interfere - allowed <br/>\nher daughter to set the timing. She didn&#39;t force a solution - didn&#39;t <br/>\nforce her to go &quot;talk about it&quot; - didn&#39;t try to make them work it out <br/>\nsince it was obvious that, at that time, anyway, neither wanted to do <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer kids played happily together for hours following that incident. All <br/>\nwas forgotten and forgiven. Maybe they talked about it later - or maybe <br/>\nnot. I know they talk about stuff like that - when everybody is feeling <br/>\ngood and they have a bit of distance and perspective. Either way, it <br/>\nwas a lovely lovely thing to watch such patience and kindness and <br/>\nintelligence at work!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]NO!","postDate":"1050120665","msgId":64384,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3ODNrcCtnaWZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgxOUU3OEQ3LTZDOTktMTFENy1COTVGLTAwMDM5M0FGNUEyRUBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64383,"nextInTopic":64560,"prevInTime":64383,"nextInTime":64385,"topicId":64262,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... lots ...

Usually the younger one <br/>\nwill give a quick swat at his brother, or sometimes he thinks it is in fun <br/>\nbut the older one doesn&#39;t.  I usually hold the one being hurt and say that we <br/>\nnever leave anyone feeling hurt or sad.  We have to be there as a family for <br/>\neach other. I usually repeat that No means No.  If Dallen thought is was <br/>\nfunny he would be laughing. I say something like would you come over hear and <br/>\nhelp me to help Dallen feel better. I try to get the hurt one to express <br/>\ntheir feelings and try to get the one doing the hurting to talk about how <br/>\nthey were feeling.

It usually <br/>\ntakes some time but we can come to a compromise so that each one gets some of <br/>\nwhat they want.  I try my hardest because I think problem solving is a skill <br/>\nthat takes practice.  I really liked the book &quot;Raising a Thinking Child&quot; at <br/>\nleast I think that is the title.

If you have two children, and child 1 keeps <br/>\nthrowing wooden blocks at child two, child one hides under a table to <br/>\nkeep from getting hit with the blocks, screaming, &quot;Stop throwing the <br/>\nblocks at me&quot; and child 1 won&#39;t stop.  Then what? <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some have said in the past that you should remove the child <br/>\nwho&#39;s being hurt.  However, I have done that and sometimes feel like <br/>\nI&#39;m just a shield, and sometimes not an effective one.  I have been <br/>\nholding a hurt child only to have the other child come and try to hit <br/>\nthem on the leg or pull their hair while I&#39;m not looking.  WHILE I&#39;m <br/>\nholding them.  Do you go somewhere and lock the door until he stops <br/>\nbanging on it and decides to calm down?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there ever a time that you&#39;re firm with your kids and say, &quot;NO!  <br/>\nYou will NOT keep hurting your sister, and then physically remove the <br/>\nchild from the situation?  If you tell them he has to go to his room <br/>\nif he has to throw things but that he can&#39;t throw things at his <br/>\nsister but he refuses to go to his room, do you physically put him <br/>\nthere?  If he leaves, do you keep putting him back in?  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering how others handle those situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ooops.
