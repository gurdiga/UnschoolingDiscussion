We are a family and we go together. If it is not <br/>\nfamily friendly, then we don&#39;t make it. However, this is your grampa&#39;s <br/>\nparty. I wonder why no kids are being included? I wonder if someone <br/>\norganized a child meal, say potluck, it would be appreciated and the kids <br/>\ncan attend. It may be the cost per plate per kid that is the reason kids are <br/>\nbeing asked not to attend the meal. Is there enough time to ask why the kids <br/>\nare not included? Maybe pointing out how lonely the kids would be missing <br/>\nthe party. Telling our real feelings can open up some doors which seemed not <br/>\nto exist. Are you up for seeking the truth from your family?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38193,"nextTopicId":38170}}
