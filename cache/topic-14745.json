I&#39;m saving the digests with people&#39;s answers because<br/>\nthere is so much great info in there.This is something I think a lot about<br/>\nat this time of year, because I try to make at least one New Year&#39;s<br/>\nresolution that has to do with being a better steward of the planet. Last<br/>\nyear it was to cut down on my car driving by 50%, and I got a bicycle<br/>\ntrailer for the kids and dropped the average number of weekly miles I put on<br/>\nmy car by about 75%, using my bike for all trips under 6 or 7 miles (which<br/>\nare the most polluting ones anyways because your car is firing up and<br/>\nstopping). The year before it was to buy at least 50% organic. I&#39;ve found<br/>\nthat usually when I start at a &quot;doable&quot; level, I find myself working up from<br/>\nthere anyways as I find that it is not that hard to change. I agree with the<br/>\nperson who said that if we all just make incremental changes it can make an<br/>\nenormous difference. I used to be involved in the &quot;Ecoteams&quot; project which<br/>\nwas exactly that idea - people would go through a 6 week class that focused<br/>\nthem on changing the things that make the *most* difference in areas like<br/>\nenergy, food, transportation, water, etc. and you committed to doing certain<br/>\nactivities in the workbook (like replacing your shower heads with low-flow<br/>\nshowers) or making certain changes (like turning off the faucet when you are<br/>\nbrushing your teeth, or carpooling once a week). They found that once a<br/>\nperson changes a habit for a few weeks, they have developed a new habit and<br/>\nit usually sticks. People could set the level of commitment wherever they<br/>\nwere comfortable. Then, each ecoteam was supposed to go out and<br/>\nrecruit/spawn two more ecoteams in their neighborhood., thus it would grow<br/>\nto a critical mass.You can find out more about ecoteams and starting them<br/>\nat: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.globalactionplan.org/.\">http://www.globalactionplan.org/.</a> I really urge people to read this<br/>\nwebsite, it is a great program for instituting real change, household by<br/>\nhousehold!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, my goal is to plant and tend my own organic garden. I can<br/>\nsympathize with you Carol because I hardly got any gardening done last year<br/>\nafter my little girl started crawling! Before that I could set her in the<br/>\ngarden on a blanket, but after that it was chasing her and pulling rocks,<br/>\nbugs, twigs, dirt out of her mouth. This year we&#39;re going to re-do and<br/>\nterrace our backyard and put in a swingset. Hopefully she and her brother<br/>\ncan then entertain themselves while I get some gardening done! My son loves<br/>\nto help me garden and this year we did manage to plant and harvest our own<br/>\nHalloween pumpkins and pie pumpkins. Next year I hope to grow a much bigger<br/>\npercentage of food. I&#39;m also trying to reclaim my knowledge of sustainable<br/>\npractices, things like canning and sewing.

One of the columnists for the Newshour did an<br/>\n&gt; essay on something similar - how we lose sight of the poor in this season<br/>\n&gt; of excess.  The visual at the end was stunning in its poignancy.  She had<br/>\n&gt; all these images of excess (furs, yachts, etc.) and in the upper center<br/>\n&gt; outlined by a strand of pearls was the face of a small African child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what am I doing for the world : I am homeschooling my children, I am<br/>\n&gt; working on recycling more, simplifying more, consuming less, composting<br/>\n&gt; more, using organic products and planting more plants.  I am particularly<br/>\n&gt; interested in getting some rare (endangered) native CA plants to put on<br/>\n&gt; my land.  I know a native plant nursery which sells them so I won&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt; something from the wild! I am working on being a good steward for the l<br/>\n&gt; and where I now live - I have 12 acres of redwoods, live oaks, madrones,<br/>\n&gt; and lately lots of mushrooms! Spiritually I am working on developing<br/>\n&gt; more compassion and in May I have tickets to see/hear the Dalai Lama<br/>\n&gt; teach.  I hope from that to learn what more I can do to heal the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW Sonoma State University (part of the California State University<br/>\nsystem)<br/>\n&gt; used to publish a report of the ten most under-reported news stories of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; year.

Many of you probably know all about biointensive already,<br/>\nbut for those who don&#39;t, the quick explanation is that through the use of<br/>\ndouble digging and composting you can get huge yields from a very small<br/>\ngarden plot with little to no input from artificial fertilizers. Practiced<br/>\non a local scale, it can help solve worldwide food distribution problems, as<br/>\nwell as resource squandering and pollution problems arising from the<br/>\ntrucking and manufacture of petrochemical fertilizers and use of pesticides<br/>\nand herbicides. It conserves and actually restore lost topsoil. It is very<br/>\nwater-conservative -- important given the water shortages looming in many<br/>\nparts of the world. In my (admittedly very idealistic) opinion, it offers<br/>\none of the fundamental keys to world peace, because when everyone has a bit<br/>\nof productive garden to tend resulting in enough food for their family and<br/>\ncommunity to eat, the motivation for territorial aggression goes way down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have an impressive network of training workshops that operates<br/>\nworldwide, and those they train are committed to teaching others. So that,<br/>\nperson by person, the word is spreading in Africa, Mexico, Russia, South<br/>\nAmerica, Asia.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey need all the money they can get, and whenever I have a little spare<br/>\nmoney, I make a donation. They have almost no overhead and use every penny<br/>\nfor the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, check them out at www.growbiointensive.org.

(Amazon has it.) Make a donation. (Once you join, you get a<br/>\ngreat newletter a few times a year.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of these days I&#39;ll write to Warren Buffet and Bill Gates and urge them<br/>\nto support this organization. In the meantime, I have you guys to nag -- and<br/>\nto think I only just joined this list. Oh, the cheek of me. Sorry -- I just<br/>\nreally, really believe in what Ecology Action does.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, we also homeschool, drive as little as possible, don&#39;t expose our<br/>\nkids or ourselves to commercial advertising, buy and grow organic, don&#39;t buy<br/>\nor eat packaged, processed food, and try to spread love and kindness with<br/>\nevery though, word and deed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening!
