The man who runs it<br/>\nhas adult children but not much contact with small ones.  When we come in,<br/>\nthe kids (all 5 of them) love to climb up on the counter stools to tell him<br/>\nwhat we need, they talk to him about the animals or 4-H or hunting or<br/>\nwhatever.  He ALWAYS has candy for them.....so at Halloween, we took a big<br/>\nbag for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the kids were gone to grandma&#39;s this last week and I went in the<br/>\nfeedstore.  Carl asked about the kids and I told him they were gone.  He<br/>\nsaid &quot;I have to ask, how do you do it?  Don&#39;t get me wrong the kids are<br/>\nalways very nice here, very polite but when they get home......they have to<br/>\nbe going in a thousand different directions?  How do you do it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI replied &quot;I drink lots of herbal tea and simply let them go.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl kind of grinned and said &quot;That might be an idea.&quot;  Then he went back in<br/>\nthe back to get something else I needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl came back out and said laughingly, &quot;Now that I think about it....it is<br/>\nprobably a really good idea.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;melissa4123&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melissa4123@...\">melissa4123@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 04, 2004 9:44 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] defending educational experts /<br/>\npreschool<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@e...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Betsy&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have no answer to your question but, I do think that I remember<br/>\n&gt; this having come up some time ago.

At one time some of the members of my group were all for<br/>\ngoing to see him and talk about the proposed legislation. I didn&#39;t care to<br/>\ngo, and some other members felt it was like inviting trouble with the local<br/>\nDOE. At the time there was increased paranoia in CA due to a memo being<br/>\ncirculated about hs being illegal (it&#39;s not of course). However I believe<br/>\nthat the push for this one year early, is entirely to do with an extra year<br/>\nof free child care for the large population of economically struggling<br/>\nfamilies in much of this electorate, and almost nothing to do with education<br/>\nadvantages. These are children who are already in childcare of varying<br/>\nquality - and much of it is overcrowded and overpriced. The affluent have<br/>\nnannies, not group daycare. Some schools offer paid kindergarten. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want preschool, but many people would like the financial relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I don&#39;t want <br/>\ntaxpayers to subsidize this for every child, even when the parents can <br/>\nafford it and/or the kids don&#39;t want to go.  Even if there isn&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;enough&quot; childcare available and even if it is expensive, I like the <br/>\nfact that it is diverse; people who use it can pick a program that they <br/>\nfind appealing (e.g Montessori preschool).  To drive existing daycares <br/>\nand preschools out of business and supply one generic government school <br/>\nexperience for 3 and 4 year olds is really a crappy idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And while I&#39;ve got the word &quot;crappy&quot; in mind can I link this with the <br/>\npotty-training thread?  Is it likely to be mandatory to start government <br/>\nschooling at age 3 and to be potty trained at that age without <br/>\nexception?  Good grief.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, of course, I think kids benefit from spending lots of time with <br/>\nloving parents at home or in the world.  Let&#39;s dump the ingrained idea <br/>\nthat love and comfort &quot;spoil&quot; children and make them too weak for life&#39;s <br/>\nstruggles and battles.
