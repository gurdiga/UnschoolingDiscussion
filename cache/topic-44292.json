The doctors and I have been fighting about<br/>\nChris for two years. As I have said many times, I know he has a medical<br/>\nproblem but it cannot be as bad as the teachers have put on. Eventually the<br/>\ndocs just have to give in and try your suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The weird thing is that Chris is never at home the way he is at school.<br/>\nHe has weird ticks though (Your discription rung a bell for me.) He says<br/>\nthat there is a beeping noise in his head and it makes him &quot;talk out&quot;. He<br/>\nmakes these space age sound effects or animal noises. Its not really bad at<br/>\nhome, except at night when he is trying to go yo sleep. But his teacher says<br/>\nhe does it constantly at school. I hope this does not mean there is<br/>\nsomething else they can &quot;diagnose&quot; him with. One teacher diagnosis in a life<br/>\ntime is enough&lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the support. Taje Care.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrightest Blessings,<br/>\n               Virginia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 24<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 17 Sep 2002 02:58:47 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;ebmsc&quot; &lt;ebmsc@...&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: ADD/ADHD - Thoughts on Labels<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Virginia,<br/>\n<br/>\nI can somewhat relate to your description of your son.  I&#39;ve never<br/>\nsent my daughter (who&#39;s almost 6) to school, and I self-diagnose her to<br/>\nbe ADHD based on the checklist that can be found on almost any ADD<br/>\nwebsite.  In addition, she has developed TICS, so I&#39;m self-diagnosing<br/>\nher as having Tourettes.  She also has explosive outburts and blame<br/>\neverybody for her problems.  I&#39;m looking into coping techniques from<br/>\n&quot;The Explosive Child&quot;.  I joined a Tourette&#39;s list, because her tics<br/>\nwere so severe at one time, we panicked.  Sad to say, the majority of<br/>\nthe list members advocated medication --- this list is not a homeschool<br/>\nlist, so I don&#39;t think the members can relate to me very well.<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for a more homeschool-friendly list for<br/>\nchildren with &quot;special needs or gifted&quot; (however you want to call it)<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t immediately jump to meds as a quick-fix to all their<br/>\nproblems.<br/>\nI also finished reading the book &quot;ADD - A different perception&quot; by Thom<br/>\nHartmann, and it&#39;s a very empowering book.  He criticises the public<br/>\nschool system for failing to deal with gifted children, whom the<br/>\nteachers easily dismiss as &quot;problem&quot; children.  Another book that I<br/>\nfound empowering is Thomas Armstrong&#39;s &quot;In Their Own Way&quot; and &quot;The<br/>\nMyth of ADD&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don&#39;t believe in the school system anymore, and anything<br/>\nthat requires interaction with the school system, I avoid as much as<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you will find homeschooling a more satisfying and rewarding<br/>\nexperience for you and your son.   This list keeps people &quot;sane&quot;,<br/>\ninstead of other lists e.g. for special needs or whatever, which seems<br/>\nto advocate that people with &quot;disorders&quot; are outcasts and needs meds<br/>\nto function completely in society.  This is a very sad picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes,<br/>\nMerilyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.386 / Virus Database: 218 - Release Date: 9/9/2002</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44242,"nextTopicId":44296}}
