I had a wallet stollen<br/>\n1 month ago from my unlocked car. Today it was hot, baby T 2.5years threw a<br/>\nfit. I brought her shoes with us. Such a terrible mom I am. Well then son 5.5<br/>\nwas a little wild after homeschool tennis group and wanted to race 4 other<br/>\nkids in the parking lot. We are at the high school in town. Not a runable<br/>\nparking lot. So I have a new wallet, two kids going a zillion directions and I<br/>\njust don&#39;t know what I did with the fine black leather which houses my<br/>\nidentity and ice cream money. At 3pm I tear the car apart wondering where it<br/>\nis. I want to take the kids for ice cream at 4pm. We drive to swim practice,<br/>\nthe two little one&#39;s and I cool off in the local fountain. All the while I&#39;m<br/>\nwondering, did I leave that wallet on top of the car?<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t. Turns out baby T secured my wallet with Bitty baby in her back pack.<br/>\nI sure am glad I didn&#39;t leave my wallet on the roof of my car.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ate sundaes, shopped for birthday gifts, had pizza, and I never never never<br/>\nam going to lose this wallet, again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44413,"nextTopicId":44498}}
