I suppose that is because I <br/>\nwas usually given the oprotunity to learn about subjects that I was <br/>\ninterested in.

If I <br/>\nread a book that I really liked, I would get every book written by <br/>\nthat author and read them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result, I usually ended up knowing, understanding, and <br/>\nretaining a lot more than they ever taught in school.  I was <br/>\nalso &quot;lucky&quot; enough to have teachers who understood that I learned <br/>\nbetter on my own.  Yes, I was still required to turn in book reports <br/>\nand similar projects but I was usually given the leeway to do these <br/>\nprojects on subjects that interested me (which was not always what <br/>\nwas being taught in class).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that is why I have had no real problem understanding and even <br/>\nembarcing unschooling.  All I know is that I want my daughter to <br/>\ngrow up loving to learn about things that interest her and not being <br/>\nforced to study things she has no interest in; memorizing the <br/>\nanswers so that she can pass the test and then prompty forgetting it <br/>\nall.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":239750918,"authorName":"Heather  Woodward","from":"&quot;Heather  Woodward&quot; &lt;bacwoodz@...&gt;","profile":"bacwoodz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Is learning fun?","postDate":"1143754115","msgId":113136,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWM2NTQ0MCRlOTAzZDM2MCQwMzAxYThjMEBENDZGUzQ4MT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM0MS4xMGUzOWU3LjMxNWQ5MmM3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":113135,"nextInTopic":113137,"prevInTime":113135,"nextInTime":113137,"topicId":113135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s also what we are learning.
