Being homeschooled, his <br/>\nschedule could be really flexible, and depending what your state child labor <br/>\nlaws say, you could declare a school-year schedule that makes those days days <br/>\noff, if the co-op plan wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in Kirby&#39;s case he was offered the job because when he was 12 and 13 he <br/>\nhung out there and was helpful.  He&#39;d volunteer to help clean up, or fold <br/>\nflyers, or move furniture, and he ended up organizing the Pokemon tournaments <br/>\nbecause he had a knack for remembering all the rules and being able to explain them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your son could hang out at the bookstore and offer to file or dust or <br/>\nclean the storage room or I don&#39;t know what.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105250,"nextTopicId":105261}}
