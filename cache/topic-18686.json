I began cutting school when I was your daughter&#39;s age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 14 I took MYSELF out of school and entered an independent study HS, which made a world of difference, and my studies excelled.  But I had to go all the way to the county seat of the school board and threaten to drop out.  I fought with my parents, the school, everyone, but I got out.

My name and general info. are below. I am 34, <br/>\nwill celebrate 16 years of marriage in October to my wonderful <br/>\nhusband (who is a mail carrier) and unschool (have homeschooled for 6 <br/>\nyears and am new to unschooling) our 4 fabulous sons (born 8/29/86, <br/>\n1/8/88, 8/17/90 and 12/12/91). We live in NE Ohio with our male cat <br/>\n(Red), 3  female Guinea Pigs (Bubbles, Buttercup & Blossom) who <br/>\njoined our family yesterday (we had a male  bunny named Cat and he <br/>\nwas too agressive for us to handle.....the family we gave him to have <br/>\nother bunnies), male dog (Black Lab named Buckeye) and 2 male <br/>\nMississippi Map turtles (1 we have had for almost 6 years and the <br/>\nother for a little over a year--their names are LT and DM for <br/>\nLawrence Taylor and Dan Marino). I am a &quot;Lake Girl&quot;  (I love Lake <br/>\nErie and living within walking distance --5 blocks) and a &quot;small town <br/>\ngirl&quot; (which makes living in this tiny village of 1500 people <br/>\nenjoyable).<br/>\n<br/>\n My dh is a mail carrier and I have always been an at home mom. I am <br/>\nvery family oriented (of course) and am a &quot;koolaid mom&quot; (this is the <br/>\nhouse all the kids congregate at).<br/>\n<br/>\n I am an Ohio native and my dh is a New York native but my mother <br/>\n(who is 53) and sisters & their families live in TX (my dad lived in <br/>\nOH almost all of his life and moved to KY last August and passed <br/>\naway, at age 53, last Nov.---the day after Thanksgiving) and my dh&#39;s <br/>\naunts, uncles and cousins live in NY while his brother and his wife <br/>\nand daughter & her family live in CA and his son lives in HI (my dh&#39;s <br/>\nparents would be 80 and 85 this year but they passed on in 11/79, his <br/>\nmom and 11/81, his dad.....his parents died on 11/23 and 11/25 and my <br/>\ndad died on 11/24). I have 2 younger sisters (ages 34 and 26) who <br/>\nhave 5 children between them (Martha, 33, has 1 son and 2 <br/>\ndaughters.....Timothy was born in 1/87, Krysten was born in  12/88 <br/>\nand Bailey was born TODAY around noon TX time--weighing in at 8#3oz. <br/>\nand measuring 21 in. long--I am a very happy aunt today!!!!) & Lynda <br/>\nhas 2 sons--Forrest born 3/94 and Perrin born 12/12/00--my 9yo&#39;s <br/>\nbday) & Gary has 2 older brothers (his oldest brother is 55 and other <br/>\nbrother would have been 45 this year) who have 3 children between <br/>\nthem (Bob has 1 daughter, Tina, who will be 33 this year and 1 son, <br/>\nBrian, who is 27 & Alan&#39;s son, Michael, is 17) and Tina has 2 <br/>\nchildren (Antony, not Anthony, is 12 and Marley was born 12/22/00). <br/>\nWe don&#39;t see our families often but we speak to them often and <br/>\nemail/IM them often. Gary & I are the only ones in our families to <br/>\nhomeschool our children but thankfully everyone accepts our choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n I enjoy reading, taking long walks, listening to music/going to <br/>\nconcerts (I am 80&#39;s rocker type....LOL), cooking/baking, being with <br/>\nmy family, travelling (on a shoestring) and more that I can&#39;t think <br/>\nof.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway....that&#39;s me in a nut shell....sorry for rambling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forward to getting to know everyone and sharing <br/>\ninfo... :-)<br/>\n                                       Tracy-Lynn<br/>\n<br/>\nWife to Gary for 15 1/2 years<br/>\n Unschooling Mom to 4 sweet boys:<br/>\nCrisstoffer ~14 1/2, Andru ~13,Wylliam~10 1/2 & Danyel ~9</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18661,"nextTopicId":18796}}
