Very long, <br/>\nvery curly, very tangly.  It&#39;s been a long process.  We wash about once a <br/>\nweek - just when both the kids get stinky.  then we glob on the conditioner <br/>\nand let it sit.  Then we comb.  It used to be a screaming match.  I talk <br/>\ncalmly throughout.  telling her how it will break off in clumps if not combed <br/>\n(we jhave a cat who mats and this illustrated the problem nicely), how <br/>\nbeautiful her hair is when it&#39;s combed, how we could decide to cut it short <br/>\nif she really doesn&#39;t want it combed, yada, yada.  Options given and <br/>\nrejected.  Crying time shortens.  Each time someone outside comments on her <br/>\nhair (it really is beautiful!), I mention how it was just combed.  Now she&#39;s <br/>\nasking for it to be combed.  She&#39;s not happy during the combing but likes the <br/>\nend result.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure this was the right way or the wrong way.  She didn&#39;t want her <br/>\nhair cut, which seemed to be the only logical resolution to the problem.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s started looking at herself in the mirror now.  Ultimately it was her <br/>\ndecision to keep her hair long and have it combed.  At least I think it was.  <br/>\ni looked at it like her inhaler.  She doesn&#39;t particularly like to use it, <br/>\nbut if she doesn&#39;t, she gets an asthma attack with each and every cold.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s mostly accepting of that now too.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58704,"nextTopicId":58725}}
