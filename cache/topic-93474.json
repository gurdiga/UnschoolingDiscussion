I was driving the cart and <br/>\n  my son was walking along with me.  Well, it is very busy in front of this <br/>\n  store, no curb, just flat with the road and only a few feet from it.  We stopped <br/>\n  for a car and then the next let us go.  Coming out of the automatic doors was a <br/>\n  young woman with 2 kids, about 3 years and 6 months.  She was carrying the <br/>\n  baby and driving the cart, while the 3 year old walked with.  All the while, <br/>\n  hollering at him to keep moving, get out of the way, etc., etc.  Something catches <br/>\n  his eye and he turns to run back into the store, she kicks at him to prevent <br/>\n  it, it doesn&#39;t work.  She then puts the baby on the floor, next to the cart, <br/>\n  almost all the way out the door.  The baby starts crawling towards the street <br/>\n  while she goes after the other.  Somebody yells the baby is going toward the <br/>\n  street, she grabs the 3 year old up by the arm and drags him over and swats his <br/>\n  behind and then grabs the baby by the arm, yelling at them the whole time.  My <br/>\n  son and I both were walking with our mouths wide open.  I know I was giving <br/>\n  her a horrible look, disgust and pity.  Then she screams at me, &quot;Hey, lady you <br/>\n  can take them with you!!!&quot;.  If she wasn&#39;t moving so fast, and I wasn&#39;t so <br/>\n  shocked, I might have said something.  There were a couple other people but no <br/>\n  one got involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, Andrew was horrified and when we got home he was so worried that <br/>\n  those kids would not be safe.  He asked if she was really gonna give her kids away <br/>\n  to a stranger and that we need to find them so we could really take them <br/>\n  before she gives them to someone bad.  And on it went.  And then again tonite he <br/>\n  asked if they were okay.  So it&#39;s still bugging him.  What should I do or say <br/>\n  to help comfort him?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pamela   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
