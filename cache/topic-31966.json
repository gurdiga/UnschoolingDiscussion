I will be <br/>\nsorry to see it go, since it has be the catalyst for so many <br/>\nfriendships for all of us. But we all move on, and it’s time to let <br/>\nothers take up the crusade! We now have several similar conferences all <br/>\nover the US and Canada. GO to them! &lt;g&gt; These conferences change lives!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re delighted to once more be in the beautiful mountains of North <br/>\nCarolina near Asheville, September 3-7, 2008. Again we will be taking <br/>\nover the mountain at the beautiful, majestic YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly, <br/>\na full-service conference center situated on 1200 acres of woodland <br/>\nbeautified by mountain streams, wildflowers, ridges, valleys and <br/>\nspectacular views.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur speaker panel includes Anne Ohman, shining star of her <br/>\nSHINEWithUnschooling e-list; Scott Noelle, host of the popular and <br/>\ninspirational Daily Groove; James Coburn, wired for sound as well as <br/>\nanything you can plug into him!; Ronnie Maier, better known and loved <br/>\nas “dragonfly” on the message boards and e-lists; and young adults, <br/>\nBrenna McBroom and Cameron Lovejoy, both fixtures of the Live and Learn <br/>\nConference and poster children for unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe’re looking forward to the Funshops and Roundtable Talks that you all <br/>\nwill come up with. The dads and teens will have their open panels, and <br/>\nwe’d like to have a few children take the leap to speak before the <br/>\ngroup as well. Grandparents receive free registration and are warmly <br/>\nwelcomed at Live and Learn, so we hope to see even more opportunities <br/>\nfor grandparents to share of themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will have several new events and activities this year. Old favorites <br/>\nlike the talent show and the picnic will continue. But you will be <br/>\nWOWed by the concert given by AMY STEINBERG on Wednesday evening. And <br/>\npack your costumes because we will be hosting a Masquerade Ball on <br/>\nSaturday night! Please see the Special Events page for details as they <br/>\nare added.<br/>\n<br/>\nLodging will be similar to last year’s set up, you will be booking all <br/>\nhotel and lodge rooms through us as part of your registration. Please <br/>\nspend some time on the Blue Ridge Assembly site thinking about which <br/>\ntype of space you would like. The rooms will be available on a first <br/>\ncome - first served basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hope you&#39;ll decide to join us! This is a wonderful opportunity to <br/>\nspend time relaxing in a beautiful area of the country while recharging <br/>\nyour Unschooling batteries, reconnecting with old friends, meeting <br/>\nvirtual friends, and \u2028being inspired as well as inspiring others!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait to see all the familiar faces and meet some new ones!<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo…I am pleased to announce that the 2008 Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>\nConference Website and Shop are now officially open!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
