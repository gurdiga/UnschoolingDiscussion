Then she asked:...my real question is how do folks handle young<br/>\nchildren who see something on television or hear about a friend doing it and<br/>\ndo the &quot;me too&quot; routine.  Do you rush out and sign them up for ballet<br/>\nbecause they saw a ballarina on tv?  Or sign them up for karate because they<br/>\nlike to watch the Karate Kid movies.  Or do you try and set up some activity<br/>\nwith a homeschooling group so they can &quot;play&quot; at it until they are older and<br/>\nreally know what it is that they want or buy them a ballarina costume so<br/>\nthey can play at home.  Not to say that they don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to be a ballarina<br/>\nat that moment, just that what they want is to play at it, not get serious<br/>\nabout it<br/>\nand take lessons in a very organzied sense.<br/>\n...AND, also, how much is too much. I thought it was a bit too much to haul<br/>\na 2 yo around 6 days a week (plus he has sunday school on sundays) and on<br/>\nsome days to 3 different activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone once said: &quot;It is hard to be a homeschooling family if you are never<br/>\nat home!&quot;<br/>\nOne could probably also say: &#39;&#39;It is hard to be an unschooling family if you<br/>\nare always taking classes?&#39;&#39;<br/>\nWhere I live there is a very strong pressure for kids to be doing all sorts<br/>\nof &#39;&#39;enrichment&#39;&#39; stuff - to the extent that you can find yourself being<br/>\nfrowned upon as somewhat neglectful if your kids aren&#39;t. Seems crazy to me -<br/>\nI know kids who are at school from 7h30 till 13h30, then rush off to pack in<br/>\n2 or 3 activites in the afternoon, after which they rush home to do homework<br/>\nand tumble into bed so that they can do the same thing the other days of the<br/>\nweek. Where is the time to just be a child? And/or to learn about life?  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot even touching on the real learning that we are discovering in<br/>\nunschooling!!!<br/>\nAnyway, years ago we thrashed out a &#39;&#39;policy&#39;&#39; that works for our family,<br/>\nand means that everyone has something and their mom isn&#39;t going crazy trying<br/>\nto keep up with the taxi service!<br/>\nBasically, everyone may (not must) select 1 or 2 activites (not more) for<br/>\nthe year. In November we/they begin to reflect and plan what they will be.<br/>\nThe first month of the new year is spent selecting these activities (trying<br/>\nout various things they are interested in). Then they make our choices,<br/>\nsettle down and get on with it. We spend a lot of time chatting during this<br/>\nperiod; it has become a valuable time in our family of self-discovery and<br/>\ndiscovering each other. We also pray - God made each one unique, and with<br/>\nspecial giftings, passions and interests. Discovering these is like opening<br/>\npresents at Christmas; an exciting and special experience. The challenge is<br/>\nin stilling the outside noise (other people&#39;s opinions, outside pressures<br/>\netc) enough to hear from God and from the person inside what these giftings,<br/>\npassions and interests are - what makes you tick. Who are you and what<br/>\nshould you be doing right now to develop and/or express that uniqueness?<br/>\n(This by the way is THE key attraction of unschooling for me - it stills the<br/>\nnoise and makes it easier to hear...)<br/>\nSo, I have one daughter who has a passion for dance; seems to have been born<br/>\nwith it. For her the choices are easy; she continues with Ballet and adds<br/>\nIrish dance for this year. (For the past 3 years it has been Spanish dance).<br/>\nVery structured, very disciplined, but right for her.<br/>\nOn the other hand, our son, who last year experienced all the pressures of<br/>\nhis friends playing cricket, soccer, rugby etc, and who really felt he<br/>\nneeded to do likewise, has found his heart - it is so exciting. He has<br/>\ndiscovered his passion for science. So now he doesn&#39;t want to do a so-called<br/>\nextramural; he has asked for an equivalent allowance to spend at the Science<br/>\nshop, and has got into rocketry and electronics.<br/>\nWith regard to the &#39;not more than 2&#39; limit, I have explained why to the<br/>\nkids - I am concerned that there won&#39;t be enough time for them to do other<br/>\nimportant things, that they will become pressurised and stressed, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nquite fit in with this still new unschooling lifestyle we are pursuing,<br/>\nalso, there<br/>\nis a limit to how much driving one mom (with a 6month old baby) can do in a<br/>\nweek, and that there is not enough money available in the budget for more.<br/>\nHowever, if someone really feels strongly about doing an additional<br/>\n&#39;extramural&#39;, let&#39;s talk. Maybe we can find a way of circumventing the<br/>\nproblems. Especially with regard to the older children, I have suggested<br/>\nthat there may be ways of earning the money to pay for another activity if<br/>\nthey really want it. So far they have been happy with the 2 activity quota,<br/>\nand agree with the reasons - I know because I have heard them explaining<br/>\nthem to their friends!!<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31953,"nextTopicId":31694}}
