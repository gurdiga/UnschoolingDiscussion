Every time I hear of another government<br/>\nprogram directed for<br/>\nhomeschoolers I cringe.  The other day I watched the debate<br/>\nfor governor in New Jersey.  Yeah, I know I don&#39;t live in<br/>\nNJ.  I just like to watch this stuff occasionally.  I&#39;m<br/>\nodd.  Anyway, a man got up and said something like &quot;We&#39;re<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  Why do we have to pay for public schools?&quot;<br/>\nAnother one asked why doesn&#39;t the state do something to<br/>\nhelp out private schoolers and homeschoolers.  My daughter<br/>\nthought it was really cool to hear homeschoolers speaking<br/>\nout.  She also thought they all had a point.  <br/>\nShe wanted to know why I haven&#39;t spoken up like that.  She<br/>\nwanted to know why I cringed with each statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her quite simply, I don&#39;t want any help from the<br/>\ngovernment.  I don&#39;t want any of their strings or their<br/>\nattention.  I don&#39;t want to give them a chance to get their<br/>\nfoot in the door.  Basically I want Uncle Sam to leave me<br/>\nalone (on that score anyway).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet.
