Here&#39;s an interesting site that lists various bands and <br/>\nhow they fit into the punk history&#39;s timeline:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI always think of The Who when I think of punk history- mostly due to <br/>\ntheir Quadrophenia album and movie.  Although it is about the &#39;mod&#39; <br/>\nand &#39;rockers&#39; clash, I feel like this album and movie really made way <br/>\nfor the punk movement.  The Who really seemed quite &#39;punk&#39; compared <br/>\nto what was going on in their day.  Pete Townsend was the first to <br/>\nreally smash his guitar and destroy instruments on stage.  They were <br/>\nLOUD and went around destroying hotel rooms and driving cars into <br/>\nswimming pools when that wasn&#39;t the &#39;norm&#39; for music bands.  <br/>\nInterestingly enough, they also &#39;discovered&#39; Jimi Hendrix and gave <br/>\nLed Zeppelin their band name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something interesting I found written about Quadrophenia:<br/>\n<br/>\nQuadrophenia - The Story<br/>\nAn Introduction by Marc Leaman <br/>\n<br/>\nQuadrophenia... the ultimate Who album. The album in which all that <br/>\nhas gone before comes together into one perfect package. The <br/>\ndefinitive Rock album, although perhaps not the definitive Who <br/>\nalbumyet still the most &quot;Who&quot; of any Who album. QUAD was the only <br/>\nPete Townshend production for his band, which may be the reason for <br/>\nthis. Or perhaps it was one of those elusive moments in Art when many <br/>\nelements come together and a higher level is achieved. In any case, <br/>\nit might be questioned but never dismissed that the essence of Rock <br/>\nmusic was better defined than within these 82 minutes. Unlike <br/>\nTownshendís earlier work, TOMMY (a fantasy which reflected the <br/>\nyearning for but ultimate rejection of spiritual enlightenment by the <br/>\npopulous), QUAD is almost stark in its realism. In a brilliant <br/>\ndisplay of songwriting prowess, both the story and the music of QUAD <br/>\nare multi-leveled and complex. On the surface it is merely the story <br/>\nof James Michael Cooper, Mod. With him comes his psychological <br/>\nproblem, that being a four way split personality (designed to reflect <br/>\nthe four members of The Who, mislabeled Quadrophenia in reference to <br/>\nSchizophrenia). Jimmy is supposed to be four people: a tough guy, a <br/>\nromantic, a lunatic, and a hypocrite. Sometimes one could just as <br/>\neasily be another, and like real life there&#39;s no real pattern, so in <br/>\nthe end it seems a writing tool never completely utilized by <br/>\nTownshend. <br/>\n<br/>\nJimmy is a member of the Mod scene, and (like most teenagers) he&#39;s <br/>\ndesperately attempting to fit in. And failing, despite being an <br/>\nadvocate and devoted follower of Mod-consciousness. That&#39;s on the <br/>\nsurface. Embedded within this story, one can find the adolescent <br/>\nangst common to us all. As usual, Townshend was speaking for his <br/>\ngeneration. Jimmy is a typical frustrated teenager (if such a being <br/>\ncan be said to exist), bound to find THE ANSWERS yet unable to see <br/>\nhow. Envying the guys who seem to have figured it out, not realizing <br/>\nthey are no wiser than he. Desiring the girls he cannot approach, not <br/>\nyet aware their needs are different yet no less compelling than his <br/>\nown. Wanting to be accepted as an adult, while in the core of his <br/>\nbeing he knows that he isn&#39;t really prepared. QUAD captures this <br/>\ndilemma so perfectly that it could serve as a primer to help any teen <br/>\nget through adolescence. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s take the story itself step by step. &quot;The story is set on a rock <br/>\nin the middle of a stormy sea.&quot; So Townshend said at Largo, Maryland <br/>\n(or was it Philadelphia?) for the opening of this story. Jimmy is <br/>\nsitting on this rock in the bay, with rain pouring on him, reflecting <br/>\non his woes to date. The album opens with the crashing of waves <br/>\nagainst the rock, in the theme of Helpless Dancer. &quot;Is it me, for a <br/>\nmoment?&quot; &quot;Bell boy&quot; &quot;Love reign o&#39;er me.&quot; Jimmy, feeling tortured by <br/>\nit all, screams in agony: &quot;Can you see the real me, can ya? Can YA?&quot; <br/>\nThe Real Me kicks in as Jim angrily recounts his attempts to be <br/>\nunderstood. He recalls the sessions with his psychiatrist, where <br/>\nJimmy doesn&#39;t feel he&#39;s getting through. The psychiatrist: &quot;never <br/>\nbetrays what he thinks.&quot; Frustrated, he turns to his mother, but <br/>\nunfortunately she can only offer: &quot;I know how it feels, son/Cause it <br/>\nruns in the family.&quot; No help there. With wonderful imagery, the song <br/>\nshows how the frustration takes Jimmy&#39;s consciousness to a higher <br/>\nlevel (as on an acid trip): &quot;The cracks between the paving <br/>\nstones/Like rivers of flowing veins.&quot; Jim notes that even those in <br/>\nthe neighborhood he knows are really strangers to him &quot;peeping behind <br/>\nfrom every windowpane.&quot; He has lost his girl and cannot figure out <br/>\nwhy. His life is turning to shit, and no one can understand him. He <br/>\nfells alienated and alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo Jimmy turns at last to a holy man, although so bitter now that <br/>\nhe&#39;s &quot;full of lies and hate.&quot; The preacher, used to less volatile <br/>\nsituations, is frightened but doesn&#39;t really understand. So he does <br/>\nhis best to show Jim the path as he sees it, not able to grasp the <br/>\nstrength of the forces at work within Jimmyís skull. It&#39;s not enough <br/>\nfor Jim, and he rejects it ending with the same frustrations, <br/>\nintensified. The four personalities then grip him, one by one. <br/>\nMusically, this is shown by each theme in the song Quadrophenia. They <br/>\nrage through him, and in the end Jimmy is left weakened and <br/>\nreflective. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy feels he needs a direction. Jim thinks that being a Mod can <br/>\nsave him; can solve his problems. Even in a less spiritual work, <br/>\nTownshend cannot escape the humanís basic drive for spirituality. Mod <br/>\nis Jimmyís religion, his buffer from the harsh reality of a life he <br/>\ndoesnít quite understand. He tires to rationalize his behavior and <br/>\nlifestyle to himself, alternately justifying the lifestyle (&quot;Why <br/>\nshould I care/If I have to cut my hair/I&#39;ve got to move with the <br/>\nfashion/Or be outcast.&quot;) and declaring his belief in the truth of it <br/>\n(&quot;I&#39;m out on the street again/And I&#39;m leaping along/Dressed right/For <br/>\na beach fight&quot;) but is still honest enough to feel itís not doing <br/>\nwhat he needs it to (&quot;but I just can&#39;t explain/Why that uncertain <br/>\nfeeling/Is still here in my brain&quot;). Here we also see how rejected <br/>\nand separated he feels even form his Mod pals (&quot;Why do I have to be <br/>\nthe same old row again and again/Why do I have to move with a <br/>\ncrowd/Of kids that hardly notice I&#39;m around/I work myself to death <br/>\njust to fit in&quot;). Even Modism isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s all he&#39;s got. <br/>\nHis goal becomes being the perfect Mod. This will be his salvation. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in search of the relief he so desperately needs, he goes to see a <br/>\ntop Mod band at a live show (The Who, of course). It&#39;s not long <br/>\nbefore he realizes they are no more than a reflection of their <br/>\naudience (&quot;You declared you were three inches taller/You only became <br/>\nwhat we made you&quot;). The band admits to this (&quot;No surprise/I told <br/>\nlies/ I&#39;m the punk in the gutter&quot;) and tries to convey a feeling of <br/>\nvision (&quot;And yet I&#39;ve lived your future out/By pounding stages like a <br/>\nclown&quot;). But Jimmy needs real heroes; someone he can look up to. <br/>\nSomeone who has successfully dealt with the problems he faces. And so <br/>\nthis is just another letdown for him. He returns home to find himself <br/>\nthrown out, because his mother had found drugs (leapers) in his room. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlone, he still finds the strength within himself and the idea of Mod <br/>\nall he has &quot;discovered&quot; is that these particular people aren&#39;t up to <br/>\nhis standard. So while he admits that he&#39;s got problems (&quot;I&#39;m a <br/>\nloser/No chance to win&quot;), he also has what it takes to overcome them <br/>\n(&quot;You&#39;ll all see/I&#39;m the one&quot;). Jimmy gets a job as a dustman. High <br/>\non self-declarations, he maintains &quot;Things are changing/I&#39;m not going <br/>\nto sit and weep again&quot; and &quot;Just like a child/I&#39;ve been seeing only <br/>\ndreams/I&#39;m all mixed up but I know I&#39;m right&quot; After two days of this <br/>\ndirty and nonfulfilling work, Jim quits his job. His answer lies <br/>\nelsewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain thrown into depression, he rages against life (&quot;And when your <br/>\nsoul tells you to hide/Your very right to die&#39;s denied/And when a man <br/>\nis trying to change/It only causes further pain&quot;). Like any other <br/>\nteen, Jimmy is looking for the fairness in life, and not finding any <br/>\n(&quot;And you get beaten up by blacks/Who though they work still got the <br/>\nsack...&quot;). In the end, he can find only one solution: giving up (&quot;You <br/>\nrealize that all along/Something in us is going wrong/You stop <br/>\ndancing.&quot;). And that&#39;s no solution at all. Jim begins to feel once <br/>\nmore that the problem lies within him (&quot;I try to number those who <br/>\nlove me/And find exactly what the problem is/Is it in my head/Or in <br/>\nmy heart&quot;). The evidence seems to point in that direction <br/>\n(&quot;Statements to a stranger/Just asking for directions/Turns from <br/>\nbeing help/To being questions&quot;); he can&#39;t interact with anyone around <br/>\nhim. It must be his fault. <br/>\n<br/>\nSearching for what seems an impossible solution, Jimmy rides out in <br/>\nhis GS scooter. He is still declaring his Modism (&quot;My jacket&#39;s gonna <br/>\nbe cut slim and checked/Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open <br/>\nneck&quot;), striving to be a perfect Mod. Then Jimmy sees the girl he <br/>\nloves with his best friend, which seems to be the final straw, and is <br/>\nupset enough to crash the bike. He can only reject everything (&quot;I&#39;ve <br/>\nhad enough of living&quot;), because it&#39;s all been taken away form him <br/>\nanyway. Even the Modism he knows appears corrupt (&quot;I&#39;ve had enough of <br/>\ndancehalls/I&#39;ve had enough of pills/I&#39;ve finished with the <br/>\nfashion/And acting like I&#39;m tough/I&#39;ve bored with hate and <br/>\npassion/I&#39;ve had enough of trying to love&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\nJim has lost everything he loved. This is the low point in his life. <br/>\nAnd yet, though depressed and frustrated, he still clings to the <br/>\nbelief that Mod can save him. It&#39;s all he has left and he must find <br/>\nan uncorrupted group of true believers, so he will at last find the <br/>\npeople with which to fit in. Other, perfect Modsso he gets pilled up <br/>\nand takes the train to Brighton, where he remembers everything as <br/>\nbeing perfectly Mod. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe leapers take him into a surreal mental state, and the whole <br/>\njourney is one long observational trip (ìGirls of fifteen/Sexually <br/>\nknowing/The ushers are sniffing/Eau-de-cologning/The seats are <br/>\nseductive/Celibate sitting/Pretty girls digging/Prettier women&quot;). <br/>\nThere is no action, just images filtered through a pill-induced haze <br/>\n(&quot;Magically bored/On a quiet street corner/Free frustration/in our <br/>\nminds and our toes/Quiet storm water/My generation/Uppers and <br/>\ndowners/Either way blood flows&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\nUpon arriving, he finds the seaside rather less than perfectly Mod <br/>\nthis time. There are no other Mods around, and here Jim is just as <br/>\nlonely as at home. So he goes down to the beach (Here by the sea and <br/>\nsand/Nothing ever goes as planned) He recalls the &quot;good old days&quot; <br/>\nwhen things were the way they should be (&quot;I am the face/She has to <br/>\nknow me/I&#39;m dressed up better than anyone one within a mile&quot;), moans <br/>\nabout his situation (&quot;So how come the other tickets look much <br/>\nbetter/Without a penny to spend/They dress to the letter&quot;), and <br/>\nthinks evil thoughts about his former girlfriend and girls in general <br/>\n(&quot;How come the girls come on oh so cool/And when you meet them/Every <br/>\none&#39;s a fool&quot;). (Note: At this point, the story becomes a bit <br/>\ndisjointed. The proper sequence, as the photos show in the booklet, <br/>\nhas Jimmy seeing the Bell Boy and then stealing the boat. Song-wise, <br/>\nit&#39;s the other way aroundwhich makes no sense; how could Jim meet the <br/>\nBell Boy after getting stuck on the rock? So I&#39;m going to report it <br/>\nin the correct sequence, or at least the sequence I see as correct.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, for the final time, Jimmy&#39;s heroes are dashed to pieces. <br/>\nThe &quot;Ace Face&quot; Mod he remembers from his last visit is now seen as a <br/>\nlowly Bell Boy. Instead of the swaggering Mod leader (&quot;Ain&#39;t you the <br/>\nguy that used to set the paces/Riding up ion front of a hundred <br/>\nfaces&quot;), we have a bowing-and-scraping fellow, trying to justify it <br/>\nall (&quot;I&#39;ve got a good job/And I&#39;m newly born/You should see me <br/>\ndressed up/In my uniform) to his former admirer. But as always, <br/>\nreality sets in (ìBell boy!/Gotta get running now/Keep me lip <br/>\nbuttoned down/Carry this baggage out/Always running at someoneís <br/>\nheel). Jim has now, truly, had enough. Everything he believed in, all <br/>\nof the people he has looked to for leadership or help, has let him <br/>\ndown. Even Modism has let him down. It was a pale mockery of what he <br/>\nwanted, or needed, (really what he thought it was) and was never any <br/>\nsolutions there. <br/>\n<br/>\nNothing there to save him which wasn&#39;t found within himself. He gets <br/>\na bottle of Gin and begins to rage (&quot;Laugh and say I&#39;m green/I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen things you&#39;ve never seen/I&#39;ll take on anyone/Ain&#39;t scared of a <br/>\nbloody nose/Drink till I drop down&quot;). Every weakness he sees (and <br/>\nhates) in himself, he now denies. Every cruel and ugly behavior he <br/>\ncan think of, all of the things he wants to do but cannot, he claims <br/>\nas his own (&quot;You say she&#39;s a virgin/Well I&#39;m gonna be the first <br/>\nin/Her fella&#39;s gonna kill me/Oh, fucking will he&quot;). He does, at <br/>\nleast, realize that he has unleashed the beast within himself (&quot;He <br/>\nonly comes out when I drink my gin&quot;), but this is a time for the <br/>\nbeast because there&#39;s nothing left for any other in the life he has <br/>\nrejected. Coupled with this are flashes of rationality (&quot;Is it me, <br/>\nfor a moment&quot;), where Jimmy actually wonders what indeed he really <br/>\nis. Who is the real Jim? Is it this me, for a momentor is it that me? <br/>\nOr are any of the four James Michael Cooper the real me? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the crisis building to the climax; he&#39;s no longer able to <br/>\nreconcile the four people that he is. As it all becomes too much for <br/>\nhis mind to deal with, he is coming closer to a solution. Once again, <br/>\naggravation (not to mention the gin & pills) takes his mind to a <br/>\nhigher level (&quot;The stars are falling/The heat is rising/The past is <br/>\ncalling&quot;). All part of the rational Jim trying to figure out what&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on. <br/>\n<br/>\nDisgusted, angry, and still in a higher state of consciousness he <br/>\nsteals a boat and heads for a lonely rock in the bay (&quot;I&#39;m flowing <br/>\nunder bridges/And flying through the sky/I&#39;m traveling down cold <br/>\nmetal/Just a tear in a baby&#39;s eye/Let me flow into the ocean/Let me <br/>\nget back to the sea/Let me be stormy, let me be cold/Let the tide in <br/>\nand set me free&quot;). Here, perhaps, he can figure it all out and find <br/>\nand answer. The rage within him has cooled, and now he is a bit more <br/>\nreflective (&quot;I&#39;m remembering distant memories/Recalling other <br/>\nnames/Rippling over crayons/And boiling in the train&quot;). And, upon <br/>\nclimbing up on the rock, the boat drifts away, and he&#39;s stuck out <br/>\nthere, in the rainwhich is where the story began. His reflection is <br/>\nover. The four facets of his personality visualize themselves before <br/>\nhim in the falling water. He sees them swirling about him, coming <br/>\nslowly closer and closer tighter, until at last they overlapand <br/>\ncoalesce into one. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the moment of realization for Jimmy. It all becomes clear, <br/>\nall of the problems and also a possible way of solutionfor the only <br/>\nsolution for any problem must come from within. No one can really <br/>\nsolve anything for him. He must meet the challenges of life one by <br/>\none and deal with them himself. And more than anything else, trust in <br/>\nhimself. Sure, he still faces all of the problems he did only moments <br/>\nago. But now he knows he can deal with them. They aren&#39;t as crushing <br/>\nas they seemed, insurmountable and impossible. Overjoyed, freed, and <br/>\nfeeling very spiritual, Jimmy embraces the rain (rather than cursing <br/>\nit) and allows the water to run over himwashing away his pain and <br/>\nfilling his soul. Instead of rejecting love, he must draw it to him <br/>\n(&quot;Only love can bring the rain/That falls like tears from on high&quot;) <br/>\nand let it cleanse him. Only through the pain can come joy; only <br/>\nthrough the pain can on recognize happiness. And in the end, only <br/>\nlove matters (Love, reign o&#39;er me&quot;). Jim realizes that love, however <br/>\nfleeting and temporarily it may be, is goal worth seeking <br/>\nnonetheless. And that without it, life is empty and dry (&quot;On the dry <br/>\nand dusty road/The nights we spent apart, alone/I need to get back <br/>\nhome/To cool, cool rain&quot;). <br/>\n<br/>\nThis ending is typically Townshend. Rarely does he really end a <br/>\nstory, because in real life there is no endingjust moving on to the <br/>\nnext situation. The triumph here for Jimmy is that he has climbed a <br/>\nlevel in his development. He&#39;s on his way up. True, he may fall back <br/>\ndown againbut at least he has learned how to climb and which <br/>\ndirection to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, notice that water plays a big part in the spiritual <br/>\nrealizationjust as in many Townshend songs, like The Sea Refuses No <br/>\nRiver and The Ferryman (which was based on the Buddhist tale <br/>\nSiddhartha). This is a common image for many writers aspiring to <br/>\nspirituality in their works, and Townshend uses it well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have made the case QUAD is less spiritual and more realistic than <br/>\nother Townshend works, but thereís no denying the parallels of coming <br/>\nto the Universal Mind and Jimmyís embrace of the solution. I still <br/>\nread much of the story as more self-affirming than spiritual, but <br/>\nsongs like Drowned and Love Reign Oíer Me (for two) are quite <br/>\nspiritual in essence. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are flaws in QUAD; not only is the story out or sequence but <br/>\nJimmy&#39;s behavior does not really indicate four separate <br/>\npersonalities. Townshend, in wanting to create a definitive Who <br/>\nalbum, stretched to the point of attempting to reflect the four <br/>\nmembers of The Who. When in fact the story works just as well without <br/>\nthis element. The movie version ignores it completely. And it&#39;s just <br/>\nas well; it complicates the story with nothing gained. To <br/>\nreach &quot;everyman,î as is clearly Townshend&#39;s goal, the hero should be <br/>\nan &quot;everyman&quot; after all. Too, the four facets of Jimmy&#39;s behavior are <br/>\ncommon enough to be found in any adolescent. We are, all of us, multi-<br/>\nfaceted individuals to begin with. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe story is set in a 1964-5 London/Brighton, but again this isn&#39;t <br/>\nextremely important. Mod as a cult (in this story) is analogous to <br/>\nany group (or religion), even a small group of friends. So again, <br/>\nQUAD is a universal tale. Since the vast majority of people (at least <br/>\nin the Western cultures) go through a traumatic adolescence, it is an <br/>\nextremely universal tale. <br/>\n<br/>\nRock Music itself is a reflection of youth and rebelliousness, and <br/>\ngoing through adolescence is the most traumatic part of our youthand <br/>\nthis makes QUAD the definitive Rock album. At least, the most <br/>\ndefinitive so far...</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86181566,"authorName":"jenneferh2000","from":"&quot;jenneferh2000&quot; &lt;jenneferh2000@...&gt;","profile":"jenneferh2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Punk was: Re: Music and strewing","postDate":"1104958577","msgId":102366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyaGs5aCsxNmduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxREI4REUyLjEwNDAyMDNAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":102362,"nextInTopic":102376,"prevInTime":102365,"nextInTime":102367,"topicId":102280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My partner does a Celtic Music radio show, and I came across this 2004 CD in his collection that might be of interest to some: Shite n Onions volume 1 An","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1073742306\">My partner does a Celtic Music radio show, and I came across this <br/>\n2004 CD in his collection that might be of interest to some:<br/>\n<br/>\nShite &#39;n&#39; Onions volume 1<br/>\n&quot;An international compilation- 22 tracks of the best shite from 15 <br/>\nup -and-coming Celtic/Punk bands&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.ShiteNOnions.com<br/>\nwww.Omnium.com<br/>\n<br/>\n...it&#39;s pretty entertaining...<br/>\n<br/>\n;-)<br/>\nJennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, julie w <br/>\n&lt;jjjwoolfolk@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I always have enjoyed the more irish-punk bands </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202074434,"authorName":"Lorrie Shenenberger","from":"&quot;Lorrie Shenenberger&quot; &lt;homesweetclass@...&gt;","profile":"luv2hmschool2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Punk was: Re: Music and strewing","postDate":"1104952699","msgId":102362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxREMzRDdCLjAwMDAwQS4yMjYzNUAzUUpINDBCPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwMTA1LjEwNDIxMS44MjAuNS5mcmVlZm9ybUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":102357,"nextInTopic":102366,"prevInTime":102361,"nextInTime":102363,"topicId":102280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the link for the Dolls....they are my all time fave punk band.

(Iggy Pop and the<br/>\nStooges was mentioned on a couple of pages and Iggy had a connection to<br/>\nBowie.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a bit that matches what I absorbed about punk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mt.essortment.com/punkrockhistor_rapl.htm\">http://mt.essortment.com/punkrockhistor_rapl.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe history of Punk rock music and what it meant, both musically and<br/>\nsocially.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike any musical genre, it&#39;s hard to pinpoint that time and place where it<br/>\nactually began. But unlike any other musical genre, Punk rock was started as<br/>\na deliberate reaction to the mass commercialism of music. In the year 2000,<br/>\nit&#39;s common to see someone &quot;being A punk,&quot; rather than seeing someone &quot;be<br/>\npunk.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, the music industry rang eerily familiar in<br/>\nits method of promoting trends over music. The public was being spoon-fed<br/>\nmusic that corporations simply intended to make a profit from. The backlash<br/>\nto this came to be known internationally as Punk rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew York, early 1970&#39;s. Young, virtually unknown artists like Patti Smith,<br/>\nthe Velvet Underground, and the Dolls of New York(changed later to New York<br/>\nDolls) brought about a new style of &quot;alternative-bohemian&quot; entertainment,<br/>\nrooted in a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; attitude. Short, frenetic songs, aggressive,<br/>\nsometimes confrontational stage presence, and angry messages against<br/>\nconsumerism hit the stages at venues like New York&#39;s CBGB&#39;s, starting the<br/>\nmovement that would be known as punk rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nBands like the Ramones and the Talking Heads would evolve out of the punk<br/>\nrock movement, and become influences for those who shared a similar distaste<br/>\nin what was occurring in the music industry. Some say the underlying roots<br/>\nof punk was the frustration and anger from being treated as sheep, while<br/>\nothers say punk stemmed from the &quot;politics of boredom.&quot; It was both.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalcolm McLaren has an indelible role in the history of punk rock, either<br/>\nbeloved or hated for his managerial skills. In February of 1975, the New<br/>\nYork Dolls, once a forerunner in punk, tried to revive a lagging career by<br/>\nhiring McLaren as their new manager. Understanding the value of shock,<br/>\nMcLaren took the band and reintroduced them as born again communists. They<br/>\ndraped themselves in communist flags and said catchy phrases like &quot;better<br/>\nred than dead.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately for the band, they continued to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately for McLaren, they continued to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter his attempt with the New York Dolls, McLaren relocated to England and<br/>\nteamed up with his friend Bernie Rhodes. The two nurtured a band that was<br/>\narguably their greatest success, the Sex Pistols. McLaren and the Pistols<br/>\nadopted an anarchistic view of the world that made them instaneous<br/>\ncelebrities. With spiked hair, tattered clothes, and safety pins as jewelry,<br/>\nthey frequented talk shows and publicly badmouthed fellow artists, bands,<br/>\nand musicians. They spoke harshly of the British class system and the<br/>\nsubjugation of the working class. They made news for concert violence and<br/>\nfighting with fans. The Sex Pistols were also as notorious for their<br/>\nbrashness as they were for their inability to play their instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir shock value not only brought them fame, but made them the single most<br/>\nrecognizable punk band. Therefore, many believed that punk rock began with<br/>\nthe Pistols, while others believed it made punk into a novelty and signified<br/>\nthe beginning of the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the internal turmoil in the punk movement, punk rock made several<br/>\nthings clear to international audiences. Punk Rock, in its subculture,<br/>\nmanaged to break down many barriers of expression and language. It made an<br/>\nindentation in the commericial music industry. It provided a fresh<br/>\nalternative to a boring, stagnant music scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut most of all, punk&#39;s legacy lies in its introduction of self employment<br/>\nand activism. It illustrated that anyone can do it themself, without<br/>\nreliance on the commercial media or the luxury of having financial<br/>\nabundance. Against the backdrop of mass consumer conformity, the punk rock<br/>\nmovement made a statement of individuality that was heard worldwide.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135609248,"authorName":"julie w","from":"julie w &lt;jjjwoolfolk@...&gt;","profile":"juliewinar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Punk was: Re: Music and strewing","postDate":"1104907747","msgId":102333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxREI4REUyLjEwNDAyMDNAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNyZnU3YSs1NW5mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNyZnU3YSs1NW5mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102331,"nextInTopic":102336,"prevInTime":102332,"nextInTime":102334,"topicId":102280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If only I could get ds to not yell they suck when the Ramones come on my play list.
