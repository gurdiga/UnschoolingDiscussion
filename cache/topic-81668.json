Very cool Anne.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne morning when I was jogging up our street I heard a bunch of mockingbirds screeching loudly and looked up to see a hawk in the middle of the street with one of their babies under it&#39;s talons. I felt bad for all the mockingbirds, bravely trying to divebomb the attacker, but the hawk sat there nonplussed, and eventually flew up into a tree to eat his/her meal. It&#39;s amazing to see birds of prey in action.<br/>\nThe pelicans doing their fantastic dives into the ocean still amaze me! <br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81600,"nextTopicId":81667}}
