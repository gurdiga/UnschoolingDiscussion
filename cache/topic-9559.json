My husband and I are not<br/>\n&gt; getting along.  (For about 5 years now) and I want to get out of the<br/>\n&gt; marriage.  I took me a long time to come to this conclusion because I really<br/>\n&gt; believe that kids need a daddy too.  But I think they would be better off<br/>\n&gt; without one in this case.  Anyhow,  I am really worried about their<br/>\n&gt; education should I actually make the leap.  I homeschooled Lili for<br/>\n&gt; Preschool this year and loved it.  She also did very well and does not like<br/>\n&gt; going to school.  (We tried it for a while)<br/>\n&gt; I do not want her to go into a public school and a private school is also<br/>\n&gt; something I dont want and could not afford anyway.  If I leave him I will<br/>\n&gt; have zero support from my family and I will have to work full time to<br/>\n&gt; support my two kids.  Does anyone know any stay at home work opportunities<br/>\n&gt; that could actually support two kids?

The logistics?  My husband works outside the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;home and I have my own business which I work around the kids.

Do you schedule everything at night?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Do you work when the other is home and available for the kids?  Do you work<br/>\n&gt; &gt;only weekends?

My oldest will be 6 in Sept.  When he was 4 we<br/>\n&gt; tried the preschool route, too.  It lasted from Aug- the end of Nov.  My son<br/>\n&gt; began wanting me to be there all of the time, because I often helped out.  On<br/>\n&gt; days that I was not going, he did not want to go either.  Also, he did not<br/>\n&gt; like the idea of having to conform to the group, and do things like sing and<br/>\n&gt; march around the room with al of the other kids.  He just never liked the<br/>\n&gt; idea of doing something just because the group was doing it.  They had a<br/>\n&gt; Thanksgiving program in Nov, where the kids were to wear Pilgrim hats and<br/>\n&gt; sing songs.  When the time came, John would NOT have anything to do with it<br/>\n&gt; at all.  He absolutely had no interest in taking part.  All the while, I was<br/>\n&gt; considering homeschooling for my kids, and this helped confirm the decision<br/>\n&gt; to do so.  There was not anything specifically &quot;wrong&quot; with the preschool<br/>\n&gt; program;  it just did not match the needs that my child had.  He requires<br/>\n&gt; more freedom, and less conformity than traditional schooling offers.  Forcing<br/>\n&gt; him to go to school would not be in his best interest.  Who knows down the<br/>\n&gt; road how things  will go; but for now, this is the best decision for him.  We<br/>\n&gt; have 2 more children that are younger than John, and at this time, we plan to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool them, too.  Your question about  would you be neglecting your<br/>\n&gt; child if he was not initiating an area of learning...  Your child is always<br/>\n&gt; learning, even if it does not look like it.  Unschooling is something that<br/>\n&gt; takes a &quot;leap of faith&quot;.  It takes trusting your child.  It takes knowing<br/>\n&gt; that your child wants to learn innately, and as you go along, you will find<br/>\n&gt; there are highs and lows.  Times of busy, explosive learning, and times where<br/>\n&gt; you wonder if your kid is a slug!  Take time to read as muchas you can on<br/>\n&gt; home/unschooling.  There are a lot of great books and web sites available.<br/>\n&gt; Hope this is not too long!  Take care~Karen in Ind<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 16:48:18 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Not ready for many solids yet<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/20/00 7:10:08 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; A neighbour of mine told me that her daughter (who&#39;s 9mo) isn&#39;t all<br/>\n&gt;  that interested in food.

Some of the families on this list (and others of<br/>\n&gt; you as well) have contributed to a small fund I formed with the proceeds<br/>\n&gt; from my homeschooling book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (www.skylarksings.com) to help build 10,000 cyclone-proof houses in the<br/>\n&gt; coastal areas of southeast India.  The funds were to be used to purchase<br/>\n&gt; two cinder block-making machines.  These houses  which people in the<br/>\n&gt; villages are being trained to build themselves  are replacing homes<br/>\n&gt; made of mud and straw, with thatched roofs that rot easily, which are<br/>\n&gt; wet inside (with children sleeping on the floor) during the entire<br/>\n&gt; monsoon season, and which are often destroyed in seasonal flooding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am pleased to report that the machines were purchased in February and<br/>\n&gt; building is now under well underway. Each house requires 600 blocks and<br/>\n&gt; contains 352 square feet of living space (this can be a little more than<br/>\n&gt; double an average poor familys current living space, if you can believe<br/>\n&gt; it!), plus a veranda, with space for a kitchen garden and cattle shed at<br/>\n&gt; the back.  These villages are made up of 11,000 families whose ancestors<br/>\n&gt; had been landless laborers for up to 700 years, but now have regained<br/>\n&gt; land peacefully through the efforts of my Indian mothers organization,<br/>\n&gt; Land for the Tillers Freedom (LAFTI).

We have 7 children...aged 13 down to 6 mos.<br/>\n&gt; We use all kind of resources to teach our kids the Faith in our home.  We<br/>\n&gt; read lots of stories and the gospels-we go to Mass together.  But, I think<br/>\n&gt; the kids are especially open to the rich traditions that the church offers,<br/>\n&gt; so we try to implement as many of those as we can in our home...like<br/>\n&gt; celebrating feast days, lighting candles, singing songs at home.  I&#39;ve always<br/>\n&gt; liked that about the Catholic Faith-that there are so many &quot;tangible,<br/>\n&gt; hands-on&quot; ways to celebrate what we believe.<br/>\n&gt; And really, those skeptical kids are the fun ones...they really cause you to<br/>\n&gt; have to stop and think about what you believe!<br/>\n&gt; If you need some catalog resources, let me know.<br/>\n&gt; You can e-mail me privately.<br/>\n&gt; Carol from WI<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 23:36:16 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lisa Bugg&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LisaBugg@...\">LisaBugg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re:unschooling Fill in the blanks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ... and am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschooling abby next year for 7th grade... so that&#39;s why i joined this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; list... so far i haven&#39;t really read any home schooling e-mails... not<br/>\n&gt; that i<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mind at all... i know how lists go and i enjoy sidetracks<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ll yak about most anything, but if you ask a question we usually jump in<br/>\n&gt; it like a duck takes to water.  ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What made you choose homeschooling now?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; LisaKK<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 25<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 21 Jun 00 14:18:53 +0900<br/>\n&gt;    From: Covert &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:covert@...\">covert@...</a>-net.ne.jp&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Japan&#39;s ODA in the schools<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi again all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A Japanese newspaper carried this interesting story yesterday about the<br/>\n&gt; promotion of &quot;overseas development assistance&quot; in Japanese school<br/>\n&gt; curriculums.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sounds nice on the surface, but there is one glaring omission: Japan has<br/>\n&gt; come under heavy fire in years past for the way its ODA is &quot;distributed&quot;<br/>\n&gt; to so-called underdeveloped nations around the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; More often than not, the Japanese government grants this ODA to projects<br/>\n&gt; that Japanese corporations are involved in overseas. And guess what: Lots<br/>\n&gt; of those Japanese corporations working in those poorer countries have<br/>\n&gt; contracts directly or indirectly with the Japanese government. Many<br/>\n&gt; people in and outside Japan have been blasting the Japanese government<br/>\n&gt; for this practice for years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Funny how these kinds of facts conveniently get omitted from news stories<br/>\n&gt; -- and classroom curriculums as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Japanese Education Ministry&#39;s motivation for pushing ahead with this<br/>\n&gt; dubious curriculum in public schools becomes apparent in the last<br/>\n&gt; paragraph of the story.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brian Covert<br/>\n&gt; (KnoK NEWS)<br/>\n&gt; in Osaka, Japan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Daily Yomiuri - 20 June 2000]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; MATERIALS TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT NATION&#39;S ODA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Foreign Ministry has produced educational materials designed to help<br/>\n&gt; children better understand the role Japan plays in funding aid programs<br/>\n&gt; through official development assistance, and has distributed the<br/>\n&gt; materials to 3,000 primary schools nationwide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subtitled &quot;To Make Everyone Smile,&quot; the materials are a 22-minute video<br/>\n&gt; and a teacher&#39;s booklet, and is designed for sixth-grade students,<br/>\n&gt; ministry officials said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The video discusses Japan&#39;s economic recovery after World War II and<br/>\n&gt; international assistance given to Japan after the Great Hanshin<br/>\n&gt; Earthquake in Kobe. It also focuses on the difficulties facing developing<br/>\n&gt; countries, which account for about 80 percent of all the nations of the<br/>\n&gt; world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The fact that ODA from Japan, the largest ODA contributor, has been used<br/>\n&gt; to build bridges and schools in many countries is also explained in the<br/>\n&gt; video.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Following the advice of schoolteachers, the video also contains a number<br/>\n&gt; of quizzes.
