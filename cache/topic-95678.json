The examples he was giving were about everyday minutiae<br/>\nlike &quot;sister left the milk out&quot;, not serious instances of children hitting<br/>\nor otherwise hurting each other. I guess he was trying something startling<br/>\nto disrupt a negative dynamic that was becoming a habit amongst his several<br/>\nchildren. The whole idea probably doesn&#39;t remotely apply here. For some<br/>\nreason it just popped into my mind, when I read the original post about the<br/>\nbrother baiting and then tattling to his Dad, who wasn&#39;t present for the<br/>\nlead up, although Mom was aware of the whole story. It seems like the Dad<br/>\nthere *was* using incomplete knowledge as a reason to then do whatever it<br/>\nwas he was doing - speaking sternly to the other brother? That wasn&#39;t clear<br/>\nin the phrase &quot;dh rises to the bait&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really does happen that siblings try to get the other one into trouble -<br/>\nI see it with our neighbors all the time, and sometimes that girl tries to<br/>\nget Jayn into trouble with me - a futile endeavor. I have been in public<br/>\nplaces where Jayn has been doing some innocuous thing, like playing at Ikea<br/>\nin the kids&#39; section. I&#39;ve heard other children (strangers) noticing that<br/>\nshe is doing something they would apparently be forbidden to do, and<br/>\ndebating whether or not they should &quot;tell on her&quot;. Sometimes they say things<br/>\nlike, &quot;Just let her get into trouble&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Sending kids back to handle their own problems seems coldhearted to me,<br/>\nif they&#39;ve come to an adult for help.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey haven&#39;t come to me for help - they have come to me because they expect<br/>\nJayn to get into trouble, as they would from their parents if they did the<br/>\nsame thing. Or they have come because they are so accustomed to parent&#39;s<br/>\nconstantly mediating their interactions. I&#39;m talking about Jayn, or someone,<br/>\ndoing something that is merely annoying, as compared to something that could<br/>\nbe actually dangerous. I try to encourage Jayn to express herself to other<br/>\nkids at the park (eg), especially if they do something that bugs her - again<br/>\nI&#39;m not talking about things that could be dangerous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I can tell, Jayn never speaks to an adult with the expectation<br/>\nthat another child will be punished. I know that there are parents who do<br/>\npunish with time outs, or privilege removal in our local group. These<br/>\nchildren are more likely to tell tales. I hope I can tell the difference<br/>\nbetween someone who is wanting me to intervene because they need help, and<br/>\nsomeone who is perhaps jealous of Jayn&#39;s greater freedoms. Maybe I can&#39;t and<br/>\nI need to be more open to the needs behind the tattling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

And, of course, we had some testing of that.  Andy hit Dan (hard) after Dan stole his drinker bottle, so we left the park.  Once more this evening, Andy did some sort of passive-aggressive thing with a toy, that hurt Daniel.  I explained (not very nicely, either) that I would never let one of his friends come in and treat Dan that way, so I can&#39;t let him do it either.  That it stops NOW.  Our job is to protect them, even if that means we have to protect them from each other.

It isn&#39;t a steady <br/>\ntransformation - it is a 2 steps forward, one step backwards change. <br/>\nOne minute we&#39;re talking like friends, two women, and the next minute <br/>\nshe seems like my little girl again. Its FINE with me - I&#39;m not in a <br/>\nhurry and, in fact, I&#39;m kind of enjoying this time. When she was a <br/>\nreally wild super active hard-to-keep-up-with toddler, I remember the <br/>\nsame kind of forward/backward transformation happening as she became <br/>\nmore independent. But I was tired - I was pregnant the year she was 2 <br/>\nand, although I recognized what was happening - how she&#39;d venture <br/>\nfurther and further away from me, for example, but always run back, I <br/>\nwas TIRED a lot of the time then and she was very fast and impulsive <br/>\nand exhausting. This feels a bit the same, emotionally, and this time <br/>\nSHE is conscious of it too, so that&#39;s kind of cool, and I&#39;m NOT <br/>\nexhausted all the time like I was then, which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re through the stage of her feeling any need to be rebellious in <br/>\norder to make a break and feel adult - we had a bit of that. It is hard <br/>\nfor these unschooled kids to FIND something to rebel against - when we <br/>\nparents don&#39;t have arbitrary rigid rules!! &lt;G&gt; But they do have some <br/>\nurges to make things difficult in order to feel better about themselves <br/>\nwanting to be separate and independent - so things can get a little <br/>\nweird and uncomfortable sometimes. We&#39;re past that - at 19 she&#39;s so <br/>\nclearly an adult now and doesn&#39;t feel any need to make that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: was Clothes, now kids volleying rude adults&#39; comments","postDate":"1087004745","msgId":95707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBjNWQwMWM0NTAxZSRmYWM5OGJkMCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PGNhZDFucSs3ajFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95702,"nextInTopic":95708,"prevInTime":95706,"nextInTime":95708,"topicId":95678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think maybe it&#39;s because, at 3, Dan is finally moving into some of Andy&#39;s territory -- finding the same interests, wanting the same toys, etc.  Up until the last few months, they&#39;ve been almost inseparable, then in March we had to put them into separate bedroom because Dan was instigating by &#39;touching&#39; Andy&#39;s things.  I&#39;ve seen evidence that Dan baits Andy, then will run and tattle on Andy. Gary (dh) who is an only child, falls for this almost every time, expecting Andy to be more mature about it.  As an oldest, with a younger sister at the same interval my boys are, I see Dan&#39;s baiting.  I bristle at the idea of expecting Andy to just be mature and stoic -- it feel so unjust to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the problem is I remember being told that I was older, and should know not to take the bait.  I watched my little sister set up my brother for years. She would do something guaranteed to bug him, he&#39;d get mad and retaliate, then she&#39;d tattle to our Dad who ALWAYS blamed my brother (my sister could do no wrong with Daddy).  I know it&#39;s a really bad cycle, I just don&#39;t have the tools handy to stop it.  I find myself thinking (thankfully, not yet saying) the same lectures I heard as a kid, tempted to smack them all and send them to their rooms.  I&#39;ve read Sibling Rivalry (and I&#39;m going to stop by the library for it again this weekend) but as I recall, the methods she suggest -- sit down and talk until both are happy -- is something Dan&#39;s just not old enough for at 3.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s not like they pull this stuff when we&#39;re just sitting around the living room -- it&#39;s usually in the car, or when I&#39;m on the phone.  Really, most of the time they get along great.  Andy has always happily included Dan, so there&#39;s not the tag-along thing I had to endure, and Dan adores Andy wanting to be just like him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSyl  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
