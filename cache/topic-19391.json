Goldman had bought the full<br/>\nversion, all unknowing, for his son, and was disappointed and baffled when<br/>\nthe son was reluctant to read it. Then he perused his son&#39;s copy and got the<br/>\nshock of discovering that his dad had been skipping whole dull chunks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got my copy of the &quot;good parts version&quot; I was enthusiastic about<br/>\nreading it. But then I discovered that it was almost word for word the<br/>\nmovie. Call me perverse! I was hoping that the book would have more - as<br/>\nmost movie adaptations have to leave *something* out - for time, for<br/>\nenhancing the visuals, because they cast someone who looked different than<br/>\nthe original description - whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the movie makers did a fantastic job with the movie, including<br/>\nadding the framing device that recalls Goldman&#39;s story with his dad - but if<br/>\nyou haven&#39;t seen it, and want to read the book, I recommend reading the book<br/>\nfirst.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
