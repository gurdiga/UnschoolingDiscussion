Then I slowly replaced that with an orange<br/>\npekoe and green tea combo.  Next step was a green tea with lemon grass which<br/>\nis a tea that takes little or nothing to make it sweet and is really good<br/>\nwith homemade lemon ice cubes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen comes the hard step, no more tea bags.  There are a few of ways to do<br/>\nthis--the gold plated method (not us &lt;g&gt;) where you buy the organic tea in<br/>\nunbleached tea bags, the economy method (using unbleached cheese cloth to<br/>\nhold the tea leaves), the other economy method (using those tea holder<br/>\nthingys you see on proper English type shows &lt;g&gt;) or the REALLY cheap method<br/>\n(that&#39;s me &lt;g&gt;) where you dump the tea leaves in and when the tea is ready<br/>\nyou strain it into another jar.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we finally have sun again, we will be back to making sun tea on the<br/>\ndeck (glass jug, spring water and green tea left outside in the sun).  Now<br/>\nthat is good tea!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really a hoot because you would think he had invented the whole thing<br/>\nhimself and he is the best advertisement!  He just raves on and on about it<br/>\nso you would never know getting him to change was almost as hard as if I<br/>\nsaid he was going to have a bikini wax or something equally as dreadful!!!<br/>\nSo, there is hope &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lite2yu@...\">lite2yu@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 09, 2001 5:07 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:Iced Tea/Lynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/9/2001 7:51:24 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Although it really was more steps than that, first I had to get him past<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instant iced tea thing, yuck, yuck, yuck!!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok Lynda. . . if you can explain how to do this, I would be eternally<br/>\n&gt; grateful.
