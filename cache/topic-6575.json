Some are early<br/>\n&gt; readers, some are whizzes with math from the get go, some are born with an<br/>\n&gt; urge to create beauty.  It has nothing to do with age.  Once one discards<br/>\n&gt; this notion it is much easier and the kidlet is happier, for them to<br/>\n&gt; actually absorb the things they know instead of creating a surface veneer<br/>\n&gt; which dissolves and fades with age.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.
