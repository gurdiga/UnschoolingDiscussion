At the point where the dodo birds are on my 4 yr old walks in and after a minute or two asks me about the birds and if we can see them some time. So, with the laptop on my lap already I looked up info on the net about the dodo and why they are extinct--got the opportunity to discuss a little about enviornmental awareness--and then he wanted to know about saber tooth tigers (also in the movie). did you know that there were many different types of animals that had saberteeth? and that they probably used them to slice at the underbelly of the prey to let it bleed out and then chow down? More info than you wanted? Well it was a beautiful thing! oh, and when we were talking about the dodo birds Shawn said he wanted to look at their bones and then I read a little bit about what the paleontologists said and I asked him if he knew what a paleontologist was and he said &quot;a scientist that studies bones.&quot; ok, maybe I shouldn&#39;t be amazed and impressed, but I am:) and this is why I LOVE unschooling...the opportunities are constantly presenting themselves:)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth in GA<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46811,"nextTopicId":57701}}
