Great book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in grad school right now and my professor opened summer session by saying that <br/>\nschool (especially high school) robs kids of their identities and leaves them emotionally <br/>\nand physically exhausted. He said he prefers &quot;C&quot; students. They usually have their own <br/>\ninterests, work harder, talk more in class and are more interested in life. &quot;A&quot; students are <br/>\nafraid to take risks and only learn to store information in their short term memories. Often <br/>\nthey have no idea what they want to do after college, can&#39;t identify interests and end up in <br/>\nlower paying jobs. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163221353,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Quote to Share","postDate":"1084936608","msgId":94263,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM4ZWpqMCtmOTk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94269,"prevInTime":94262,"nextInTime":94264,"topicId":94263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been doing A LOT of reading lately.
