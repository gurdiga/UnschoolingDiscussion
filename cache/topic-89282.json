We <br/>\nwent to a shop the day after to catch a sale and get gifts for people we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t&#39; see before the holiday.  I had a lot more stuff that she did, getting a <br/>\nhead start on next year&#39;s Christmas list.  She waited outside as they rang me up <br/>\nand hunted for shipping boxes and such.  When I came out, I felt a need to <br/>\napologize for the delay, as she had an impatient look on her face.  She said she <br/>\nhad forgotten about the chitchat factor.  Her 10 year old son said all he <br/>\never gets asked in the store is if he wants to buy a lottery ticket.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, it&#39;s probably not everywhere.

I think I&#39;ve told <br/>\nthe story here before about how a woman commented on my beautiful girls at the <br/>\ngrocery store and he proudly said &quot;Yes, but I have a penis!&quot;  It doesn&#39;t&#39; <br/>\nreally bother him, but he doesn&#39;t&#39; get it either.

They are treated more tenderly, I <br/>\nthink, sometimes.  People treat them as sweet, caring and kind.  They are all of <br/>\nthose things but by just meeting them in a store or on the street you might not <br/>\nsee it as you would if you had a chance to talk with them.  Also my boys can <br/>\ngo in either restroom without a second look.  And at the age of 9, my oldest is <br/>\nat a stage where sometimes he wants to go in the men&#39;s room, but if it is a <br/>\ncrowded place he wants to go in the ladies room with me, I feel more <br/>\ncomfortable with that as well, and no one takes a second look.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are used to being called girls.  They just correct the person and <br/>\nusually explain that it isn&#39;t the first time someone has made that mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been two times, both in restaurants, where the waitress, has said <br/>\ngirls and the boys have corrected them.  Then she said &quot;oh...we&#39;re boys today <br/>\nare we.&quot;  The boys just looked at them like they were crazy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a waiter called the boys as girls and the boys corrected him.  He looked <br/>\nat me and asked if they were really boys.  I said yes...they would know.  He <br/>\nthen looked at a friend who was with us and asked her if it was right.  She <br/>\nanswered that the mother should know if they are boys or not.  We all laughed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when my oldest was about 6 and some kid in the grocery store made <br/>\na comment about if Dallen was a boy or a girl and Dallen said boy and the boy <br/>\nlaughed at Dallen.  Dallen was hurt and of course I was hurt that my son was <br/>\nhurt.  Dallen then told me he wanted his hair cut.  We talked.  We looked <br/>\naround and I pointed out all the men who had long hair.  We talked about what he <br/>\nliked and why he wanted it cut etc.  I told him to think about it and if he <br/>\nstill wanted it cut I would do it for him.  He thought for a few days then told me <br/>\nhe really wanted it long and was going to keep it that way.  I was proud of <br/>\nhim but totally understand what it is like to be picked on. It has never <br/>\nhappened again. <br/>\n<br/>\nEnough for me for one day.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] short hair girls","postDate":"1074455515","msgId":89294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3LjRmOGI2NGUyLjJkM2MzZGRiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89282,"nextInTopic":89297,"prevInTime":89293,"nextInTime":89295,"topicId":89282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/18/04 11:01:56 AM, kaculwell@sbcglobal.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-966266874\">In a message dated 1/18/04 11:01:56 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kaculwell@...\">kaculwell@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I have found it interesting though how she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\nreally care what people think, or that they even mistake her for a boy! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we were in a fancy toystore, little place, one room, and Holly was <br/>\nbuying something for a birthday gift.    The owner, a man in his 60&#39;s, said <br/>\n&quot;Are you ready, buddy?&quot; and dealt with all her check out business.  I had walked <br/>\nover to the music section, to keep from snickering, and when we were leaving, <br/>\nHolly said not only did he not know she was a girl, but he said two other <br/>\nthings he would only say to a boy, ending with &quot;Thank you, young man!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWHY?<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I don&#39;t get.  What&#39;s the point of treating a male customer <br/>\ndifferently from a female character?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad used to complain in the 60&#39;s that with boys wearing long hair and <br/>\ngirls wearing jeans and boots, he couldn&#39;t tell is someone walking on the street <br/>\nwas male or female.  I asked him why he cared?  He said it mattered in how you <br/>\ntreated them.  I suggested he could treat them the same way.   But he was <br/>\nraised to shake hands with a man, to give a female the right of way on the <br/>\nsidewalk and open doors for her, etc., and his very everyday behavior needed him to <br/>\nknow male from female.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s a behavior change at least in some parts of the population in two <br/>\ngenerations.  It&#39;s foreign to Holly, it was common to my dad, and I see both <br/>\nsides.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in college in the 70&#39;s the question of who opens doors was BIG.  <br/>\nSome women were used to just standing there knowing a male person would open <br/>\nthe door for her.  Some women started being vocally insulting if males opened <br/>\ndoors for them.   Lots of people were advocating anyone opening the door for <br/>\nanyone else who was carrying something, seemed frail or small or old.   Some <br/>\nolder men, though, would be insulted if a big strong college girl opened a door <br/>\nfor him.   I remember a long series of letters in the campus newspaper about the <br/>\npossibility of changing traditional etiquette, and how to act.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, it seems to have settled around here to whoever gets there first <br/>\nopens the door but goes in and holds it for the next few people if they&#39;re near <br/>\nenough.   The door-holding is relinquished to the next &quot;head of party&quot; or <br/>\nstrongest-fastest kid of a group, or  a gentlemanly looking man who seems eager to <br/>\ntake over door-holding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty case-by-case, but I also live where strangers do tend to make eye <br/>\ncontact and to greet each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt UPS, people with packages get the door held by anyone who&#39;s near.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that common everywhere?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150540278,"authorName":"Kathy Culwell","from":"&quot;Kathy Culwell&quot; &lt;kaculwell@...&gt;","profile":"natrlmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] short hair girls","postDate":"1074448929","msgId":89282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyNjgwMWMzZGRlZCQzMTY2OTU2MCQ0Y2MzZmVhOUBrYXRoeT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM0LjQ0NDQ0NTRjLjJkM2I4NzEwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":89294,"prevInTime":89281,"nextInTime":89283,"topicId":89282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"He said Holly, I like your haircut.
