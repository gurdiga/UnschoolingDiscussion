You <br/>\nput it on and cut off the extra. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is very true, but....<br/>\nI was making the materials list and knew the bottom 2x4 had to be 10 <br/>\nfeet. Knowing that the top piece would be longer, because of the <br/>\nangle, I didn&#39;t know if 10 foot pieces would suffice or if I needed <br/>\n12 foot 2x4. After doing the calculation, I could see that it was <br/>\nsuch a tiny amount that the 10 foot would indeed work fine.....no <br/>\nneed to buy 12 foot and cut the extra off. :)<br/>\nSo sometimes, knowing a little math can save you money!
