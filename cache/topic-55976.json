On the other hand, the Internet and books<br/>\n&gt; with lists of resources for homeschools seldom, if ever, mention using the<br/>\n&gt; public library.  So, for my project, I thought I would see 1) what <br/>\n&gt; resources<br/>\n&gt; the public libraries provide; 2) who uses those resources and how often; <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; 3) what resources the parent/teacher and children need/want.

All the librarians know me and my boys by name (I doubt they&#39;d <br/>\nrecognize Ben, though). Whatever I need, they order. David Albert&#39;s book just <br/>\ncame in. It&#39;s usually a two week wait for orders. We have a remarkable <br/>\nhomeschooling section---and an ASTOUNDING UNschooling section! (Yep, all MY <br/>\ndoing! &lt;G&gt;) We&#39;ve ordered Mary Griffith&#39;s books, all of Grace Llewellyn&#39;s, <br/>\nJohn Holt&#39;s (even an out-of-print one!), John Taylor Gatto&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt many libraries have the resources we have, but they COULD!
