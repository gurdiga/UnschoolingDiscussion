There, I assume he&#39;ll go &quot;urbing&quot;, which is finding<br/>\nplaces to jump his bike up onto and ride or going over jumps or whatever he<br/>\ncan find.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?  Do you use any workbook<br/>\n </span></blockquote>at<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all or is that what unschooling is all about?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the child chooses the workbook while having lots of other choices, yes.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now my oldest just wants to read his Garfield comic books or watch<br/>\n </span></blockquote>TV<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or listen to the radio or play on the computer or go sledding.  ANYTHING,<br/>\n&gt; but &quot;school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So get rid of &quot;school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I thought, well maybe he&#39;s stressed by the workbooks, so we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cut some out of our day.  No change in him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course not, if you only cut out *some* of the workbooks.  That&#39;s not<br/>\nunschooling.  Until you get rid of &quot;school&quot; and let him get over it, he&#39;ll<br/>\nstill be doing whatever he can to avoid &quot;school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretend it&#39;s summer vacation.  What would you and your kids be doing?  Go do<br/>\nthose things.  Watch what catches their interest, and find ways to give them<br/>\naccess to more of whatever it is, even or even especially if it&#39;s TV, games,<br/>\nor comics.  Help them find the connections between their current interests<br/>\nand the rest of the universe.  Pay attention to what floats past you in your<br/>\nlife and send some of it their way.  They&#39;ll find their interests and<br/>\npassions, but it rarely ends up looking like school.  I spent about the<br/>\nfirst nine years of what I thought was unschooling watching for behavior<br/>\nthat looked like school.  I rarely found it and became quite frustrated.  It<br/>\nwasn&#39;t until finding this list and paying attention to what the most<br/>\nexperienced people were saying that I stopped looking for school.  I know<br/>\nthat&#39;s hurt my son, and now I&#39;m trying to make up for it by &quot;really&quot;<br/>\nunschooling.  &lt;g&gt;  Hopefully you&#39;ll see the light earlier than I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I think he&#39;s just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; taking this being home thing for granted and needs a dose of what it could<br/>\n&gt; be like!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like a dose of school?  You *want* him to take being home for granted, as in<br/>\n&quot;this is how we live&quot;.  Get rid of the school stuff and just live your<br/>\nlives.  You&#39;ll all be happier, and your kids will end up with exactly the<br/>\nright education for each of them.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58136,"nextTopicId":58161}}
