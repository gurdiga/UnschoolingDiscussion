Maybe it was just the way it was worded but it<br/>\nsounds like you don&#39;t see a &quot;problem&quot; or the need to change anything. If<br/>\nthat&#39;s the case, just enjoy your son for who he is. Labels can be a tricky<br/>\nthing sometimes and cause more harm than good. Especially if the situation<br/>\nisn&#39;t a drastic physical one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter you mentioned this in the post, I did some research on the net and<br/>\ncame to the conclusion that two of my daughters could very well be diagnosed<br/>\nwith something similar. To me it makes no difference. Yes there are<br/>\nsituations to handle with them that I don&#39;t have with my other two children,<br/>\nbut so what really? All 4 of my kids are different in many ways. And yes<br/>\nsometimes those situations can cause turmoil around the house and<br/>\nfrustration on the part of my husband and me, but isn&#39;t that just a part of<br/>\nparenting anyway? Figuring things out? Even children with similar problems<br/>\ncan react differently to what parents try and do to help, so I would say<br/>\nit&#39;s pretty much trial and error anyway.
