They chose to come<br/>\nanyway. <br/>\nAnd I was just using Thanksgiving as an example because it occurred with<br/>\nmore than one person. But some guests come, and it doesn&#39;t matter what<br/>\nseason it is, they have to watch some kind of sports on tv, or can&#39;t miss<br/>\ntheir reality show, or whatever. I guess my point was more along the<br/>\nlines of people not just being able to visit with people. I would never<br/>\nthink of accepting an invitation to someone&#39;s house, to go and read a<br/>\nbook by myself in the corner. That is just plain rude. I guess maybe if<br/>\nsports watching was more of an inclusive social event, I would be more<br/>\naccepting of it. Whenever it has involved my family, it has always been a<br/>\n*children leave the room*, *total silence for fear of missing a play*<br/>\nkind of thing. And it is only fun (if you want to call screaming<br/>\nobscenities at the tv fun) for the couple of people actually interested<br/>\nin it. You are welcome to disagree, but in my opinion sports are taken<br/>\nway too seriously at gatherings that should be festive, and if you are<br/>\ngrumpy because the place that you knowingly *chose* to be does not have<br/>\ntv available, then yes, it has a hold on you.<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58058,"nextTopicId":58259}}
