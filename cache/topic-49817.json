Their brains work in a way that resonates with mine.  But my<br/>\nhusband, who is my closest friend, plays the cd player, and that&#39;s it.  He&#39;s<br/>\nfairly tone-deaf.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd professional musicians tend to drive me absolutely wacko.  Maybe it&#39;s<br/>\nthat we&#39;re tuned on the same wavelength, and so there&#39;s static?<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the musicians I grew up with went into the sciences (medicine,<br/>\nmainly) rather than music.  I wonder if it&#39;s logic but with room for<br/>\npersonal expression that appeals in both those areas.  Therefore, as a<br/>\nscientist of sorts yourself, Sandra (experimenting with education), that<br/>\nsame mindset appeals to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49735,"nextTopicId":49814}}
