So, I hope I&#39;m doing it correctly.  I<br/>\njust\r<br/>\nhad to write when Sandra asked if there were any other families that\r<br/>\nhad been unschooling for a while, and didn&#39;t have a problem with \r<br/>\nshowers.  We don&#39;t.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIf we are going out somewhere, my two, (almost 10, and 11) just\r<br/>\nautomatically shower.  And since, we are going somewhere almost\r<br/>\neveryday, they shower daily.   It&#39;s never been an issue, and I&#39;m sitting<br/>\nhere\r<br/>\nasking myself why.  Maybe it&#39;s because I always gave them baths before\r<br/>\nwe went out, when they were younger.  They have very thick hair, and the\r<br/>\nonly way to make it look brushed, was to condition it.  So, if you&#39;re going\r<br/>\nto wash the hair, you might as well wash the whole kid.  There were\r<br/>\nalways so many toys in the tub, that they never felt they were missing\r<br/>\nanything by being there.  Perhaps the feeling of fun has lasted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt could be because their cousins showed up at my daughter&#39;s birthday\r<br/>\nparty , two years ago, smelling.  One of her older homeschooling friends\r<br/>\nwhispered that her cousins should take a shower, and it embarrassed my\r<br/>\ndaughter, (and me too).  There was a very long discussion after that .\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt could be because we are really into the way things feel around here.  And\r<br/>\nthere is nothing like putting on warm clothes, right out of the dryer, on\r<br/>\na clean body, right out of the shower, after a long day.  Unless, you \r<br/>\nalso have just washed sheets, but I&#39;m only human.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThey have deodorant in their upstairs bathroom, which they use.  I only\r<br/>\nexplained it&#39;s purpose to them once, but they had  watched me use it\r<br/>\nfor years, (I never get any privacey).  They are really into conditioner now<br/>\n\r<br/>\nbecause the chlorine in the Y&#39;s pool has been making their hair feel\r<br/>\nstale, (my son&#39;s word).  My daughter asked the lifeguard to tell her\r<br/>\n10 minutes before the pool closed today, so she could take a shower there,\r<br/>\ncomplete with conditioner, before she went home.  My son automatically\r<br/>\ntook a shower before getting dressed to pick up his friend. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, we don&#39;t have a shower problem.  However, we do have a dirty towel\r<br/>\nproblem, which I&#39;m  going to stop complaining about.   Okay, it\r<br/>\nwas only muttering to myself, but I&#39;m going to stop it anyway.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nVicky\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I&#39;ve talked to <br/>\nher about the importance of regular bathing.  She doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>\nfair that she has to take a bath regularly and I pointed out that <br/>\nit&#39;s not just her, it&#39;s ALL people past a certain age who will smell <br/>\nif they don&#39;t stay clean.  I told her that people might think poorly <br/>\nof her if she smells bad and has greasy looking hair.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried getting her nice soaps and shower gels(she likes that when <br/>\nthey&#39;re new but the novelty wears off soon and she doesn&#39;t care <br/>\nanymore), I offered to light candles for her (she says she doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncare about candles), I offered to take a shower with her and we could <br/>\nwash each other&#39;s backs (she said no)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, how much would you remind/try to convince an 11 <br/>\nyear old to shower?  For example, I noticed on Thursday that she <br/>\nreally needed a shower, so I suggested it to her.  She said, &quot;Maybe <br/>\nlater&quot;.  So I reminded her again later in the day (like 9 pm) and she <br/>\nsaid, &quot;later&quot;.  She never did.  Friday she was REALLY smelling bad, <br/>\nand I told her that.  She said, &quot;later&quot;.  I reminded her again, and <br/>\nshe said, &quot;First thing tomorrow morning, I promise&quot;.  Saturday <br/>\nmorning she didn&#39;t shower.  Nor did she all day Saturday.  Today, I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;How about if you take a shower and then pick out some nail <br/>\npolish and I&#39;ll paint your toenails after your shower?  So she did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I nagging too much?  If I remind her once and she doesn&#39;t do it, <br/>\nshould I keep reminding her or just let it go?  What about the issue <br/>\nof body odor and not wanting other people to look down on her?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98818,"nextTopicId":98602}}
