I <br/>\nbelieve that by allowing them choices in their lives now and always they will <br/>\nbe able to make choices all through their lives and there won&#39;t be this shock <br/>\nwhen they turn 18 or 21 or whenever the magical number is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are learning how to make choices.  For us TV is just another tool.  <br/>\nAnother something to explore.  And just because they are watching TV doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean they aren&#39;t learning or processing something else they did that day.  <br/>\nAlso my boys don&#39;t just watch TV.  I watch it with them and I can answer <br/>\nquestions.  TV starts a lot of interesting conversations about a variety of <br/>\ntopics.

If you expect the child to &quot;self monitor&quot; to an hour a day then<br/>\nthe answer is never. If you expect the child to be able to freely choose<br/>\nwhat they find most interesting at any given time, then after they gain the<br/>\nconfidence that TV won&#39;t be restricted any more, then they will obviously<br/>\nself-limit to how much they want to watch. It may be more than you&#39;d choose<br/>\nfor them, but it would be self-monitoring all the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be stumbling blocks. There should be opportunities that are more<br/>\ninteresting than TV. If TV is the most interesting thing in the house, then<br/>\nlimiting TV is like schools covering up the windows so kids will will find<br/>\nthe teacher more interesting than the blinds. They may not want to miss a<br/>\nprogram. Kids can feel trapped by the TV station&#39;s schedule. If they don&#39;t<br/>\nwatch something now they can&#39;t watch it.

I have been very pleasantly surprised. The tv is on more during the day,<br/>\nbut it does not have the same appeal. My oldest used to sit glued, but now he is up<br/>\nand doing other things while the tv is on. He no longer feels that he *has* to watch tv<br/>\nevery day. In the past, if we were out and runnng around and did not get back until<br/>\nlate in the day, he would pitch a fit if he had not watched his hour of tv. Now he<br/>\ndoes not mind, he knows that he can watch it tomorrow. I have also seen that if I start<br/>\nto do something interesting (like set up the train set or start cooking) they will<br/>\nmore then likely come join me. Before nothing could tear them away from their 1 hr <br/>\nof tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning, the boys watched quite a bit of tv. But I can tell you now that we<br/>\ndo not watch anywhere near 4-5 hours of tv a day. Some days we watch more and some<br/>\ndays less, but even if it is on, we are usually doing something else at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry it, I think that your kids will surprise you. Mine did (they are 6 and almost 3).<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted our experiences a couple of days back. I will post them here now again (feel<br/>\nfree to skip if you saw this before!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I am a hundred or so messages behind, but wanted to write a quick one. I used to <br/>\nbelieve those studies about tv and we definitely limited it. What convinced me to <br/>\nchange my mind was realizing that the warnings to not let your kids watch more then<br/>\n2 hrs/day were based on kids who were in school all day. Betw school and homework,<br/>\nif kids were watching more then 2 hrs/day, they most likely were not doing much else.<br/>\nFor our kids, 2 hrs/day is really not much when you look at all the &quot;free&quot; time they<br/>\nhave. There is tons of time for them to do other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe lifted restrictions on tv back in october and it has worked great. They definitely<br/>\nwatch more then the 1 hr/day I previously let them, but I have found that they<br/>\nare now doing other things while watching (previously my oldest (6 yo) would<br/>\npretty much sit transfixed). Now he builds legos, bounces on his mini trampoline,<br/>\nplays with his brother etc. Much of the time the tv is more background noise. I have<br/>\nalso noticed that they do use the tv to relax...after we have had a really exciting day<br/>\nand also to transition to waking up in the morning (all 3 of us usually cuddle on the <br/>\ncouch and watch blue&#39;s clues). <br/>\n<br/>\nThings I have also noticed is that they don&#39;t fight when we have to go somewhere and<br/>\nturn off the tv. When my ILs were visiting, they hardly turned it on at all (my ILs<br/>\nlove playing with the boys). It is pretty easy to get them involved in other things<br/>\n(mainly with the tv on). The tv no longer goes on first thing when we get home and <br/>\nJason has started asking me to put on music. I have seen no loss in creativity...they<br/>\nstill like to do lots of stuff. It has cut back on arguments and I like that I no<br/>\nlonger make them feel bad for liking something &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only downfall is that I have lost my &quot;never-fail&quot; option...before lifting restrictions<br/>\nif I had to get something done (phone call etc) I could always let them watch tv...doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhold the same attraction nowadays...<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":107820645,"authorName":"Christine Helms","from":"&quot;Christine Helms&quot; &lt;KindredSpiritsYoga@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] More TV questions?","postDate":"1044416776","msgId":57865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMjA1MDM0Ny5oMTUzbEhFZTAyMjI5MEBjbGVhbmVyMS5jYXJvLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57871,"prevInTime":57864,"nextInTime":57866,"topicId":57865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks sandra!

Rahima balwin &quot; you are your childs first<br/>\nteacher&quot; and true many waldorf inspired books and authors have led me to<br/>\nbelieve that the best place for the TV is in the closet. And it has come and<br/>\ngone there many times. My biggest struglle is that i feel my 5 year old<br/>\nwould sit there for hours on end watching. At what point does the<br/>\nself-monitoring occur in the child? Is it the forbidden fruit that is the<br/>\ntemptation and then soon dwindles. I&#39;d really like to hear from other moms<br/>\nwho have had this same concern and who have come through to the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t beleive that a little TV is bad. It&#39;s the 4 or 5 hours a day that<br/>\nworries me that his brain is not being creative in other ways and is<br/>\nabsorbing the ideas of others on what the world is like. And it has been<br/>\nshown that the brain works differently when watching a TV program . We limit<br/>\nthe TV to 2 hours a day. But even at that i still hear, &quot; mom can i watch<br/>\nanother show?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo whats the real scoop?<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n----------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58042,"nextTopicId":57762}}
