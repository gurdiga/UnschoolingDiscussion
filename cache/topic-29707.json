Sometimes people get annoyed at discussions of <br/>\nearly readers or precocious math ability. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo hey, I&#39;ll add a few more real live unschooled kids to the anecdotal <br/>\n&quot;statistics&quot; pile here. I have three totally unschooled kids (never schooled <br/>\nfor a single day in their lives). 1 girl and the boy were reading fluently on <br/>\nthe early side of average. The girl read avidly for pleasure from then on, <br/>\nthe boy is rarely interested in fiction and only reads for information needs <br/>\nnot the pleasure of the hunt though he reads very well. The other girl was a <br/>\nbig surprise, she used sophisticated language at an early age but had a great <br/>\ndeal of trouble learning to read despite her earnest efforts. She wanted to <br/>\nread early more than any of my children but ended up a late reader anyway, <br/>\nstill struggling with it. She has definite discernable differences in the way <br/>\nshe perceives the world and the printed page.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most interesting thing about her story is that she mostly never thought <br/>\nof herself as a nonreader or slow reader. All those years when she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeing remediated or prodded by anyone but herself, she could sit on the couch <br/>\ntaking an hour to read a five sentence paragraph, and know she was a reader. <br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for the months when she was five that I HID the early readers and <br/>\nphonics materials from her and helped her twin with reading only when she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t around. But that&#39;s another story. :) No, really it&#39;s the same story. <br/>\nShe was at the time INSISTING on learning to read, insisting on trying over <br/>\nand over and over until she was crying in frustration and I felt like joining <br/>\nher. She wasn&#39;t ready. In spite of her sophisticated vocabulary she didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand rhymes (so phonics made no sense to her) and couldn&#39;t see the <br/>\ndifferences in words. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helped some. She still tried to read and failed but she wasn&#39;t so <br/>\nfrustrated because she knew she was trying to work with REALLY HARD STUFF so <br/>\nit was okay in her head for her to be messing up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, see, I guess I just supported my point. The late reading stories are <br/>\nusually more interesting, so that&#39;s what folks hear.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29705,"nextTopicId":29719}}
