I just got it from a used book store and haven&#39;t read it yet, but I<br/>\nread his book on the Civil War (from the same series) and it was really<br/>\nfascinating. It might be too dry for 11 and 15 year olds, but maybe not. He<br/>\nfills it with good anecdotes and answers commonly held myths (for instance,<br/>\nin the Civil War book, he had a subchapter heading &quot;Was Jefferson Davis<br/>\nreally captured wearing a dress?&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Native American studies, when I was a teenager I really loved reading a<br/>\nbook (novel) called &quot;Hanta Yo&quot; by Ruth Beebe Hill. It&#39;s very long and quite<br/>\ndeep (for a novel), set in the Lakotah nation. It has been translated fully<br/>\ninto Lakotah and back out to English, which makes it read differently than a<br/>\nnovel written purely in English. Depending on how interested your teenager<br/>\nis, he might like it. Warning, it does address some fairly serious issues<br/>\nthat you might have to talk about - sex, war, torture, etc. or might not<br/>\nwant a child reading (depending on your viewpoints I guess). It covers many<br/>\nof the rituals, songs, etc. of the tribal life in a way that non-fiction<br/>\nbooks really can&#39;t, giving at least a small feel for a way of life so very<br/>\ndifferent from modern culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I have magic in my mind&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who doesn&#39;t want to take her fairy wings off...ever<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13956,"nextTopicId":13960}}
