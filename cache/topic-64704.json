Joe and I had been to a Christian Homeschoolers Parent support group<br/>\nand got a real bad taste in our mouth. No we didn&#39;t feel comfortable or<br/>\nwelcomed their at all. It was just like being in church and nothing like<br/>\nhomeschooling. Actually it was like school in church!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I figured it was at least worth the orientation day as most from my local<br/>\nsupport group raved about the coach. (not all christians either) Well after<br/>\none short hour of being there and seeing my kids so unconcerned about where<br/>\nI was and having so much fun, I figured why not. It was pay as you can, come<br/>\nwhen you want stop when you want. So I went from being not sure to how can I<br/>\npossibly say no to this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; People were VERY careful not to criticize Mary&#39;s choice. Mary held it<br/>\n up, at first, as an example of a Christian group that was very open to<br/>\n and comfortable for nonChristians - and was questioned about what that<br/>\n meant.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I first spoke about it when the subject of Christian Homeschoolers<br/>\nbeing all spanking no respecting children came up. I was saying how this<br/>\ngroup which calls themselves Christian Homeschoolers isn&#39;t like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Sandra and I both said that wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n feel welcoming to us and we wouldn&#39;t want our kids involved. It IS,<br/>\n however, more inclusive than requiring a statement of faith and less<br/>\n inclusive than, say, an Interfaith sports league which is less<br/>\n inclusive than a sports league that is just SPORTS and doesn&#39;t involve<br/>\n religion at all.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess if I looked at it from a religious point of view only, I could see<br/>\nwhere it wouldn&#39;t be welcoming. But I looked at it from my children&#39;s point<br/>\nof view. Joseph has since joining come to terms with his need to win<br/>\nattitude and Sierra has managed nicely around a group of kids her own age.<br/>\n(she was very shy and he was extremely competitive) Both helpful things for<br/>\nthem both. But mostly, it&#39;s just fun for them. Joseph was involved with a<br/>\nnon religious T-ball group and by the time season was up, he hated it. With<br/>\nthis group he counts the days until Friday from Sat. They&#39;ve made lots of<br/>\nfriends and so have I. I don&#39;t look at the christian talk as anything to be<br/>\nannoyed with or upset about because it doesn&#39;t include everyone possible. I<br/>\nlook at it as a great opportunity for my children to learn and have fun with<br/>\npeople different from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got flack one time because I let Tara go to summer swims at the local<br/>\nfreshwater beach. The people there were different. They looked different,<br/>\nthey spoke different and listened to different music. Tara and her friend<br/>\nwere literally the only ones there not like everyone else. Tara had a blast<br/>\nand went all summer long. If I were uncomfortable about any of the things<br/>\nthat the other people were, Tara would have missed out on making great<br/>\nfriends and having a good time. &quot;I&quot; consider sports camp the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t have any objection to Christian environments, in general. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t find it very welcoming, though, to show up for, say, a dance  lesson<br/>\nand then be treated to an hour of nonstop Christian-only music.  We go to<br/>\nthings at people&#39;s churches frequently. Sometimes we go to  Christmas Eve or<br/>\nEaster services at other people&#39;s churches. We are<br/>\n guests there and we enjoy it very much. That is different than being a<br/>\n&quot;member&quot; of an organization that is Christian, though. It is also  different<br/>\nthan being exposed on a regular basis to child evangelism&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you also on the first part. Now if my child were older and<br/>\nobviously getting into the religion as in wanting to participate, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a problem with that.

If my kids <br/>\nwanted sports enough to put up with the praying and giving up goals for <br/>\nJesus  - I would help them make it work as best i could.  That doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean I&#39;d WANT my kids in that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mary has said over and over that her kids love the camp.

Mary held it <br/>\nup, at first, as an example of a Christian group that was very open to <br/>\nand comfortable for nonChristians - and was questioned about what that <br/>\nmeant. As we&#39;ve discovered, it means they are fine with nonChristians <br/>\nas long as the nonChristians are okay with being part of prayer circles <br/>\nand giving up goals for Jesus. Sandra and I both said that wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel welcoming to us and we wouldn&#39;t want our kids involved. It IS, <br/>\nhowever, more inclusive than requiring a statement of faith and less <br/>\ninclusive than, say, an Interfaith sports league which is less <br/>\ninclusive than a sports league that is just SPORTS and doesn&#39;t involve <br/>\nreligion at all. This was all a perfectly civil discussion and I think <br/>\nMary answered the questions really nicely and we all learned something. <br/>\nSome people may not have thought about that in some areas kids who <br/>\nhomeschool, but are not Christians, get left out of things or don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel welcome - sometimes things that it doesn&#39;t seem there is any <br/>\nreason to have religion involved, like sports or homeschool ice skating <br/>\nor homeschool 4H clubs. It is good if more people are a little more <br/>\naware of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I won&#39;t direct this to anyone specifically..

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t find it very welcoming, though, to show up for, say, a dance <br/>\nlesson and then be treated to an hour of nonstop Christian-only music. <br/>\nWe go to things at people&#39;s churches frequently. Sometimes we go to <br/>\nChristmas Eve or Easter services at other people&#39;s churches. We are <br/>\nguests there and we enjoy it very much. That is different than being a <br/>\n&quot;member&quot; of an organization that is Christian, though. It is also <br/>\ndifferent than being exposed on a regular basis to child evangelism. If <br/>\nmy kids NOW wanted to go, of course - they are 12, 15, and 18 - I&#39;d be <br/>\ncurious about what they thought and we&#39;d talk about it, I&#39;m sure, <br/>\nbecause they would want to. But &quot;let them?&quot; of course. I took mine out <br/>\nof something that became very obviously intended as a vehicle to <br/>\npressure them to become Christian, when the older two were 2 and 5 <br/>\nyears old. It had begun to seem very sneaky to me and it wasn&#39;t like <br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t have dance lessons somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at a family get-together once - my sister&#39;s in-law family - and <br/>\nthey all stood in a big circle - maybe 50 of us - and went around the <br/>\ncircle praying to Jesus, one after the other. It came to one of my <br/>\nlittle kids - maybe 8 years old - who promptly recited a little Baha&#39;i <br/>\nverse; &quot;Oh God, Guide me. Protect me. Illumine the lamp of my heart and <br/>\nmake me a brilliant star.&quot; That was it - a sweet little few lines.
