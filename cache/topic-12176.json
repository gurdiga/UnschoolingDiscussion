Isn&#39;t it great how it works! When I started <br/>\nout I had all these wonderful plans for unit studies that I thought would be <br/>\nfun, and interesting, and could incorporate all the usual school subjects <br/>\ninto one topic. It didn&#39;t take me long to find out that what sounded fun and <br/>\ninteresting to me might sound dumb and boring to the kids. Or, more likely, <br/>\nit would appeal to one kid, but not the others. So, after a few months of <br/>\ntrying to force people to participate in all my carefully planned fun, I <br/>\nbegan my own de-schooling too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, though, after two years, it seems that the kids would like to do some <br/>\nof the things that I threw out. Now that they are truly free to learn what <br/>\nthey want, they do want to learn. Now they will put the effort into it, and <br/>\nseem to be able to appreciate each others contributions and interests. So, <br/>\nwe may do a unit. This time, however, it won&#39;t be me planning it all out and <br/>\ntelling them what they are to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool starts in our district tomorrow. We traditionally have breakfast in <br/>\nour garden and watch the bus pass by. We celebrate our freedom and do a <br/>\nlittle thinking and talking about where we want to go with school this year <br/>\nand what we would like to do. When they went to school I always video taped <br/>\nthem on this day, getting on the bus, and then telling me how the first day <br/>\nwent. That tape was a big motivator in the decision to pull them out of <br/>\nschool when I looked back at the changes over the years-from a wonderful <br/>\nfamily that you would love to know, to a bunch of rude brats interrupting <br/>\neach other. Maybe I will tape again tomorrow to see what a difference there <br/>\nis now.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cararmst@aol.com","from":"Cararmst@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"SQ7Lx4lwTjG-FNw-L7m6aqdGu8X4sTYQksUvhYF1Lnex9do_AEwJzJHF2SoVYUYNKcx93uGPWA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Rebellion (was Pink Hair)","postDate":"967300034","msgId":12187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJlLjg5ODU1OWYuMjZkOTJkYzJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12183,"nextInTopic":12194,"prevInTime":12186,"nextInTime":12188,"topicId":12176,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/26/2000 7:14:28 AM Central Daylight Time, ... all ...

Then, as time progresses, and <br/>\nthe dad sees that the children and mom are happy, productive people, that the <br/>\nkids are learning and they won&#39;t be social misfits, he &quot;comes around&quot; and <br/>\nbecomes an advocate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis happened with my husband, too.  But wouldn&#39;t it be so much more <br/>\nproductive if we could bring these guys around sooner?
