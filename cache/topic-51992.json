All <br/>\nboys (which was great for MY boy).  One of the kids brought a bag of matchbox <br/>\ncars and all the little boys gathered on the sidewalk to play. One of the <br/>\nmoms immediately went over and began directing their play - not just their <br/>\nplay, their dialogue!  I remember thinking &quot;oh my god, if this is <br/>\nhomeschooling, I&#39;m out of here&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy MIL taught school for nearly 30 years so you can imagine what she thinks <br/>\nof all this.  Fortunately, DH is not close to his mom so we see her <br/>\ninfrequently (that sounds like a horrible thing to say, sorry).

I can only believe that it&#39;s because they&#39;ve been forced to sit in a <br/>\nclassroom for 7 hours, forced to &quot;listen&quot; to a teacher, &quot;forced&quot; to obey, <br/>\n&quot;forced&quot; to comply with someone&#39;s ideas about what they should be doing.  <br/>\nMaybe if our MIL&#39;s could see our children in a setting like this it would <br/>\nhelp them understand what we&#39;re doing!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth Allen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52024,"nextTopicId":52009}}
