Not ma, not ba, not dada, no bye bye, NOTHING.  <br/>\nNot a sound of any sort.  Her parents were resigned to the fact she &quot;might&quot; <br/>\nhave a problem.  I was fairly sure of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and her brother are here more waking hours than home, it seemed peculiar <br/>\nthat she had NO sound available to her at all.  She seemed in a world all her <br/>\nown for the most part.  Her mother was distant with her for sure.  Often <br/>\nsaying she &quot;didn&#39;t want to get too attached to her, since she had to go back <br/>\nto work at six weeks&quot;.  I nurtured her and held her and cuddled her.  Didn&#39;t <br/>\nmake any difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day after her second birthday she was over and we were all sitting <br/>\naround, we heard someone in a very strange voice say &quot;whose ball is that?&quot;  <br/>\nit was a voice no one recognized.  It was coming from near the front window <br/>\nwhere Courtney was standing but it was IMPOSSIBLE for her to have said a <br/>\ncomplete sentence, she made NO sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tentatively said &quot;what?&quot;  clear as day, she repeats &quot;whose ball is that?&quot;.  <br/>\nShe hasn&#39;t been quiet barely a second since.  I know that isn&#39;t really LATE <br/>\ntalking but it&#39;s odd and it&#39;s late to not be offering ANY sounds or attempts <br/>\nat communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was simply amazing to me, she still refused to speak for her family for <br/>\nprobably close to a year longer.  Not a word to them, she just allowed <br/>\nherself to be &quot;there&quot; and  not really a part of anything.  They would come <br/>\nover here to hear her speak.  Her grandparents were appalled that their <br/>\ngranddaughter would talk for someone other than her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have no explanation for it, it&#39;s probably the oddest thing regarding <br/>\nspeech and children I&#39;ve ever encountered.

That works great. Since all of us start with the ability to understand body lenguage, that seems to be the first real way in which we communicate. So why not give him some tools that he can work with.I started with learning some of the signs and introducing her with these when apropriate, words for drinking, dog, food, more and such. she picked it up realy fast and even comes up with her own, whiping of hands when she played with sand is now her word for sandbox. Offcourse I speak all the words as well as signing them. It made her less frustrated about not being able to express herself.You can read about this system at www.mybabyfingers.com.It even makes your kid smarter because it learns to use both hemisperes of the brain at the same time, neat.I think she will speak before she is 18 LOL Hope to have been of help.Greetings,  Myrrha<br/>\n<br/>\njmcseals SEALS &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmcseals@...\">jmcseals@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nMy 21 month old son (two June 30th) still isn&#39;t really talking.

I did take him for some speech therapy when<br/>\nhe was three.  It wasn&#39;t because I thought he *should* be talking.  It was<br/>\nbecause he was into the question stage, and I couldn&#39;t understand the<br/>\nquestions.  It was getting very frustrating for both of us.  Aside from<br/>\nthat, I would have waited.  It only took a few sessions to get him to the<br/>\npoint where I could understand him.

Or<br/>\ntwo and a half years.  And when I&#39;d ask about it online, people would<br/>\ntell me about genius children who never talked and then spoke full<br/>\nsentences.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLittle kids at the park, much smaller than my son, spoke in full<br/>\nsentences.  (It did *not* help that he&#39;s very tall for his age -- he&#39;s<br/>\nnot quite five now and taller than many eight and nine year olds).  The<br/>\nwhole thing made me want to stay home and cry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I cried a lot.  And I was scared.  And I didn&#39;t want to take<br/>\nhim to a government-sponsored speech therapy program because he&#39;s such a<br/>\nsensitive person that I knew he wouldn&#39;t survive public school, and I<br/>\nwas afraid that if he got a diagnosis I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to<br/>\nhomeschool.  I couldn&#39;t afford private speech therapy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI felt like a failure as a parent.  I mean, I put so much effort into<br/>\nparenting, and he couldn&#39;t talk!  There are people who put absolutely no<br/>\neffort into parenting and ignore their kids all day while they watch<br/>\ntalk shows, and their kids learn how to talk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened was not a miracle.  He didn&#39;t just wake up one morning<br/>\nquoting Shakespeare.  His first clear word was &quot;apple&quot;, at the age of<br/>\nthree.  Then he started saying &quot;kee ka&quot;, which turned out to be &quot;kitty<br/>\ncat&quot;.  It was a long, hard struggle for him to talk and to get his point<br/>\nacross clearly.  He didn&#39;t speak clearly enough for outsiders to<br/>\ncompletely understand him under he was four, maybe a little older.  But<br/>\nhe was making progress everyday, so I knew it would be ok.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s about to turn five at the end of May, and he speaks clearly and<br/>\nintelligently.  His vocabulary keeps impressing people, and he&#39;s lately<br/>\nbegun correcting his own grammar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never thought I&#39;d say this, but sometimes I wish he&#39;d stop talking for<br/>\njust a minute.  From the minute he wakes up, until long after the rest<br/>\nof the family is asleep, he never stops.  And most of that is a barrage<br/>\nof questions.  One night he came into the bedroom after I&#39;d been asleep<br/>\nand started asking, &quot;Where do the Care Bears live?&quot;  &quot;Care-a-lot.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Isn&#39;t that in the clouds?&quot;  &quot;Yes.&quot;  &quot;Don&#39;t airplanes fly in the<br/>\nclouds?&quot;  &quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;  &quot;Do you need a ticket to go on an airplane?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;  &quot;Ok, mom, you go back to sleep.  I&#39;m going to go out the<br/>\nfront door and walk to the airport and buy a ticket so I can fly up to<br/>\nCare-a-lot.&quot;  &quot;WHAT???!!&quot;  This is what I mean about wishing he&#39;d stop<br/>\ntalking for a minute now and then.  Late at night, I don&#39;t listen as<br/>\ncarefully as I should because I&#39;m trying to fall back to sleep, and you<br/>\nhave to listen carefully to someone like him, because he&#39;s always making<br/>\nplans. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I knew then how well he&#39;d be speaking now, I would have saved myself<br/>\na ton of stress.  I don&#39;t know anyone who spoke as late as my son (all<br/>\nthe other late stories seemed to end with, &quot;and then when he was three<br/>\nhe said, &quot;Mother, what are your feelings about this presidential<br/>\nadministration?&quot;  Or some other genius thing.  My son was a late speaker<br/>\nwho started at the beginning and took a long time to catch up). <br/>\n<br/>\n If I&#39;d known some of the intelligent things he&#39;d say, I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nsecretly wondered if he was, well, not smart (he also had &quot;issues&quot; where<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t play with toys the &quot;right&quot; way -- his mind works differently<br/>\nthan other kids.  For example, he never figured out the shape sorter and<br/>\nI finally threw it away in frustration).  His mind still works<br/>\ndifferently than most people&#39;s, but now I realize that it&#39;s his greatest<br/>\ngift, and he may never be a genius, but the way his mind works humbles<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also glad every day that I didn&#39;t take him to a specialist because I<br/>\nknow with his temperament and unusual way of thinking, combined with the<br/>\nspeech delay, there would have been a diagnosis.
