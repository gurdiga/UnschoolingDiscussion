My husband has to be in bed by 9:30, since he <br/>\n&gt;gets up at 4:30.  He usually goes on to bed and leaves it up to me to get the <br/>\n&gt;kids in bed.  I let them all eat a snack around 9:00, then I send them up to <br/>\n&gt;their room.  They are all allowed to read a book or play a quiet game.  The 7 <br/>\n&gt;yr. old and 11 yr old like to sit and talk, so sometimes I have to go up a <br/>\n&gt;few times and tell them to be quiet.  The 13 yr. old and 17 yr old go to <br/>\n&gt;their separate bedrooms and read, so they are pretty quiet and aren&#39;t any <br/>\n&gt;trouble.  I usually do some last minute clean up and errands for awhile, then <br/>\n&gt;I log on to the computer about 12:00 midnight.  I think we are all being very <br/>\n&gt;quiet (the master bedroom is on the first floor, while all the other bedrooms <br/>\n&gt;are upstairs.  The computer is in a nook off the kitchen, so he can&#39;t hear <br/>\n&gt;any noise from it), however lately he has been screaming and yelling at all <br/>\n&gt;of us.  He starts doing this around 9:00, and by the time he goes to bed, he <br/>\n&gt;has himself all worked up!  We are really having struggles with this.  My <br/>\n&gt;husband has always been laid back and calm, until he started this about a <br/>\n&gt;year ago.  We have tried going to bed earlier, and getting up earlier, but he <br/>\n&gt;still yells alot.  The kids and I are NOT morning people and it is very hard <br/>\n&gt;on us to go to sleep at 9:00.  I have had many heartfelt talks with my <br/>\n&gt;husband about this, and I am at my wits end.  I just don&#39;t know what else to <br/>\n&gt;do.  So I know what you are saying, since I am having the exact same problem. <br/>\n&gt; I would love to get some good suggestions, since I don&#39;t know what else to <br/>\n&gt;try and I am really getting desperate.

I have a tendency toward<br/>\nnight owlishness. Here dh has to get up early  for work so we all go to bed<br/>\nat 9pm.  Here is what we do: I get up early with dh every day and this is<br/>\nwhen I get my computer time in, to check mail and whatnot. Dh has school 2<br/>\nnights a week and doesn&#39;t get home until 9:30 so he stays up for an hour and<br/>\nhas his computer time. If he wants he can wake me up (I am asleep with the<br/>\nkids) and we can have &#39;our&#39; time. Two other nights a week he does his<br/>\nhomework from his school and on those nights he goes to bed with the kids<br/>\nand I stay up if I want to and many times he joins me. On Fridays (or<br/>\nsometimes Saturdays) we get the kids to sleep, brew up some cappuccino and<br/>\nstay up reallly late. We have some of &#39;our&#39; time and we also have a late<br/>\nnight online Bible study with some friends in the next state.  Then we sleep<br/>\nin. &lt;g&gt; . Our kids are 7, 5, 4, 3, and 2 (she is the one who isn&#39;t really<br/>\nours, but we have her on Friday nights).

My husband has to be in bed by 9:30, since he <br/>\ngets up at 4:30.  He usually goes on to bed and leaves it up to me to get the <br/>\nkids in bed.  I let them all eat a snack around 9:00, then I send them up to <br/>\ntheir room.  They are all allowed to read a book or play a quiet game.  The 7 <br/>\nyr. old and 11 yr old like to sit and talk, so sometimes I have to go up a <br/>\nfew times and tell them to be quiet.  The 13 yr. old and 17 yr old go to <br/>\ntheir separate bedrooms and read, so they are pretty quiet and aren&#39;t any <br/>\ntrouble.  I usually do some last minute clean up and errands for awhile, then <br/>\nI log on to the computer about 12:00 midnight.  I think we are all being very <br/>\nquiet (the master bedroom is on the first floor, while all the other bedrooms <br/>\nare upstairs.  The computer is in a nook off the kitchen, so he can&#39;t hear <br/>\nany noise from it), however lately he has been screaming and yelling at all <br/>\nof us.  He starts doing this around 9:00, and by the time he goes to bed, he <br/>\nhas himself all worked up!  We are really having struggles with this.  My <br/>\nhusband has always been laid back and calm, until he started this about a <br/>\nyear ago.  We have tried going to bed earlier, and getting up earlier, but he <br/>\nstill yells alot.  The kids and I are NOT morning people and it is very hard <br/>\non us to go to sleep at 9:00.  I have had many heartfelt talks with my <br/>\nhusband about this, and I am at my wits end.  I just don&#39;t know what else to <br/>\ndo.  So I know what you are saying, since I am having the exact same problem. <br/>\n I would love to get some good suggestions, since I don&#39;t know what else to <br/>\ntry and I am really getting desperate.
