Piano lessons,<br/>\n&gt;   swimming lessons, tai chi lessons, etc. I&#39;m talking about where the child<br/>\n&gt;   goes to a place, with another adult, not the parent, and learns in a<br/>\n&gt;   structured way about something. Ever do that? Or is it bad-bad-bad?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My son Julian (12) loves a bunch of structured classes and lessons. He takes <br/>\nguitar lessons from a wonderful woman who talks with him with great respect, <br/>\nas two people who love music. He&#39;s joined a series of enrichment courses at <br/>\nMIT for ten weeks, and has a blast wandering about the MIT campus, eating <br/>\nlunch at the cafeteria, figuring out where they might have moved the Music <br/>\nTheory class THIS week.  He is eagerly anticipating a hands-on program this <br/>\nsummer in oceanography in Northern Maine, by the Boston Museum of Science.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I see an opportunity I think he might like, I mention it to him, and he <br/>\ndecides if he&#39;d like to do it. Sometimes he asks me to keep an eye out for <br/>\nsomething specific he&#39;d like to do. At this point, I am the Resource Person <br/>\n-- he relies on me a lot for outside resource opportunities. I suspect in the <br/>\nnext couple of years that will be changing. (But I am also a <br/>\nResource-kinda-gal among adult friends and relatives. I tell all kinds of <br/>\npeople when I see something I think they&#39;ll love.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about the classes and lessons that has happened is: He always seems <br/>\nto end up learning from people who LOVE what they&#39;re doing, and want to share <br/>\nit. The MIT classes are taught by MIT students who are passionate about the <br/>\nthing they care about. The Oceanography is led by scientists, and the <br/>\nassumption is that the kids will act as scientists.  I think Julian would run <br/>\nscreaming from a class taught in a less empowering way. And if they tried to <br/>\ngive him a TEST about it...well, forget it. None has been condescending or <br/>\n&quot;schooly&quot; in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe when you have choices you find people to learn from who see you as a <br/>\npartner in a journey rather than someone who requires wisdom to be imported <br/>\nupon.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn Baptista<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34257,"nextTopicId":34071}}
