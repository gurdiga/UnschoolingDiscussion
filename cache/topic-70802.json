Most restaurant kitchens are worked by men here in NYC. When I <br/>\napprenticed at one of them here, the first thing they asked me was, <br/>\n&quot;Where&#39;s your knife?&quot; (I had forgotten to bring it with me, ugh!) Then <br/>\nmy chef proceeded to share with me some horror stories about unattended <br/>\nknives, blunt knives, etc. etc. Given my own accidents in the kitchen, <br/>\nI would never, EVER let a 5 month old play with a knife. It&#39;s just too <br/>\ndangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich takes me to the distinction between a rule and a safety measure: <br/>\nA rule can be haphazard. A safety measure is based on fact --a 5 month <br/>\nold does not have the motor skills to handle a knife.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, May 26, 2003, at 03:39 America/New_York, jmcseals SEALS <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; This thread reminded me of the TCS list too.  I recall a discussion on<br/>\n&gt; knives.  Someone posted about being in the kitchen and a 5 month old <br/>\n&gt; child<br/>\n&gt; was interested in a large, sharp knife.  The recommendation was to <br/>\n&gt; allow the<br/>\n&gt; baby to explore the knife with her own hands rather than redirect her<br/>\n&gt; attention or put it away.  It got really freaky and scary after that.  <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; stuck out the entire thread just to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing <br/>\n&gt; something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry but I would not allow my 5 month old child to &#39;handle&#39; a <br/>\n&gt; huge,<br/>\n&gt; sharp knife whether I was holding her or not.  Babies have very fast<br/>\n&gt; reactions and I don&#39;t see how it would even be possible to safely <br/>\n&gt; allow a<br/>\n&gt; child to hold such a thing.  Someone even said that if she happened to <br/>\n&gt; cut<br/>\n&gt; herself, she would learn &#39;respect&#39; for the knife.  YIKES!  I ran and <br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; looked back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another time an 11 year old had a 16 year old boyfriend and was having <br/>\n&gt; sex. <br/>\n&gt; There were actually people who said they should be left alone to make <br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; own &#39;informed&#39; decisions.  That it would be coercive to interfere.  She<br/>\n&gt; ended up pregnant.  Call me coercive, but I wouldn&#39;t stand idly by and <br/>\n&gt; end<br/>\n&gt; up with a pregnant 11 year old daughter, that&#39;s for sure!   There is <br/>\n&gt; no way<br/>\n&gt; an 11 year old girl is capable of truly understanding the emotional<br/>\n&gt; ramifications of sex and pregnancy, much less have the ability to be a<br/>\n&gt; mother.  That poor child *needed* a mother herself!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not every situation was as bad but I left that list after 6-8 months <br/>\n&gt; or so<br/>\n&gt; feeling frightened, appalled and scared for some of the children.  It <br/>\n&gt; seemed<br/>\n&gt; rather fishy to me, also, that everything was hypothetical.  That was<br/>\n&gt; strange.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did come away with a few bits of knowledge and insight, but overall, <br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; was an incredibly negative experience.  I always wonder if I just hit <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; list at a &#39;bad&#39; time or if it is always like that....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jennifer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; MSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.

I recall a discussion on <br/>\nknives.  Someone posted about being in the kitchen and a 5 month old child <br/>\nwas interested in a large, sharp knife.  The recommendation was to allow the <br/>\nbaby to explore the knife with her own hands rather than redirect her <br/>\nattention or put it away.  It got really freaky and scary after that.  I <br/>\nstuck out the entire thread just to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry but I would not allow my 5 month old child to &#39;handle&#39; a huge, <br/>\nsharp knife whether I was holding her or not.  Babies have very fast <br/>\nreactions and I don&#39;t see how it would even be possible to safely allow a <br/>\nchild to hold such a thing.  Someone even said that if she happened to cut <br/>\nherself, she would learn &#39;respect&#39; for the knife.  YIKES!  I ran and never <br/>\nlooked back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time an 11 year old had a 16 year old boyfriend and was having sex.  <br/>\nThere were actually people who said they should be left alone to make their <br/>\nown &#39;informed&#39; decisions.  That it would be coercive to interfere.  She <br/>\nended up pregnant.  Call me coercive, but I wouldn&#39;t stand idly by and end <br/>\nup with a pregnant 11 year old daughter, that&#39;s for sure!   There is no way <br/>\nan 11 year old girl is capable of truly understanding the emotional <br/>\nramifications of sex and pregnancy, much less have the ability to be a <br/>\nmother.  That poor child *needed* a mother herself!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot every situation was as bad but I left that list after 6-8 months or so <br/>\nfeeling frightened, appalled and scared for some of the children.  It seemed <br/>\nrather fishy to me, also, that everything was hypothetical.  That was <br/>\nstrange.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did come away with a few bits of knowledge and insight, but overall, it <br/>\nwas an incredibly negative experience.
