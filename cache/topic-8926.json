And then I make up a bunch of these little tiny glass bowls with<br/>\nhomemade dill dip, ranch dressing, peanut butter and peanut butter and honey<br/>\nin them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I&#39;ve found that when they have helped fix do the shopping and then<br/>\nhelped fix them they are more inclined to eat them.  We make homemade<br/>\ngranola and healthy muffins and stuf and they devore them because, in part,<br/>\nthey are part of the process.  They&#39;ve been either sitting on the counter or<br/>\nstanding on stools to help since they were old enough to sit unaided.  So,<br/>\nthey &quot;own&quot; the foods and thus eat things other kids might not.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, another organic food nut<br/>\n<br/>\nFruit leather recipes:<br/>\n<br/>\nPureed fruit can be dried on special, heavy plastic sheets in a dehydrator<br/>\nor in your oven. To prepare apples or pears for leather making, wash fruit<br/>\nthoroughly, peel and core removing all seeds, puree in a blender or food<br/>\nprocessor until smooth. Mixture should be of pouring consistency. It is<br/>\nimportant to add honey to help keep the leather pliable when dried. If the<br/>\npuree is too thick, add liquid to thin. If too tart, add more honey or sugar<br/>\n(stevia works, also). Heat apple or pear mixture to 190� F to prevent<br/>\noxidization, cool before pouring onto dehydrator trays. Coat trays with a<br/>\nlayer of fruit puree about 1/8 inch thick. Dry at 135� F until leathery (use<br/>\nlowest oven setting and leave door propped open). Be careful there are no<br/>\nmoisture pockets. Roll up fruit leather while warm, wrap in plastic and<br/>\nstore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also made strawberry, watermelon, peach, plum, fig and date fruit<br/>\nleather.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Brown","from":"Brown &lt;mjcmbrwn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BBz6MEMmrUi4bN7SHff0zmFI9zy45581vm4t1RW4XupIQ5uleI6BeUghUF37wITxIPOzac7hOsUnvRxB6M9SQGFx","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"fruit leather","postDate":"960238456","msgId":8926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5M0MxMzc3Ljk0N0Q4NTBAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMzcwMWJmY2YwNCQ5MmRhZTBlMCQ0ZDEwOGMxOEBjb21wYXEuc3NzbmV0LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28851,"prevInTime":8925,"nextInTime":8927,"topicId":8926,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tanya My favourite is plain persimmon.
