I&#39;m not Ned , or Yol, or Sherry, or Bridget. Let me <br/>\nsee, someone asked me if I was, or if I &quot;knew&quot; some other lady from NC, I <br/>\ncant recall her name ... actually I think it was a couple of ladies who also <br/>\nwent and made their own group. Maybe one of them was Bridget.    <br/>\n<br/>\nFor folks that only read what I write in response to Sandra. I will once <br/>\nagain answer the question of why I stay here.  I&#39;ve answered it over and over <br/>\nand over, but evidently, no one reads those posts I write.  I get accused of <br/>\nwriting negative stuff, disrupting the list, throwing tantrums. When in <br/>\nreality, I write about a lot more than in defense of myself against Sandra.  <br/>\nI suppose if I am not arguing with Sandra, or defending myself, my posts are <br/>\nnot worthy to read.  I&#39;ve been told I write too confidently.  I&#39;ve been told <br/>\nto &quot;be quiet&quot; I&#39;ve been told to ignore stuff that doesn&#39;t suit me.  And, I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen asked MANY MANY times, why I stay here, why don&#39;t I start my own list.  <br/>\nWell, the most recent response I made to those questions was on Feb 10th. <br/>\nI&#39;ll just copy it for inquiring minds who skipped over it when I posted it. <br/>\nor maybe they read it and just &quot;forgot.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n____________<br/>\nI can only speak for myself. I can just as easily call myself &quot;eclectic&quot; <br/>\nor relaxed or whatever term may best fit my style of parenting and <br/>\nhomeschooling. No one term is better or worse in my opinion. I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\ncalled a &#39;school at home&quot; person, because, I don&#39;t do school at home. I&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid before, that I find labels restrictive and I don&#39;t feel I fit any one <br/>\n&#39;way&quot; of doing things. It doesn&#39;t&#39; offend me that folks here may say. OH <br/>\nOH. You&#39;re not a REAL TRUE unschooler. Just like I&#39;m not offended if folks <br/>\nsay. OH, your not a real true Christian because I don&#39;t subscribe to their <br/>\nfundamental beliefs 100% (or heck, even 50%). I stay around this group <br/>\nbecause its active, there are lots of GOOD advice here, and I have made some <br/>\nfriends. For unschooling information, ( which is what I look for, even if <br/>\nI&#39;m not &quot;there&quot; yet) this group has consistently been the best source I have <br/>\nfound. That&#39;s why I hang around here. Folks can call me eclectic or relaxed <br/>\nor &quot;unschooling modified&quot; LOL.. ( although, I don&#39;t INTEND to modify <br/>\nunschooling in my home. its just I&#39;m lower on the continuum and still <br/>\nlearning). I know I&#39;ve been called much worse :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n____________________<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as why so many other lurk. I can only assume its because they also get <br/>\nGOOD information.  They take it and sort through it and use what is helpful <br/>\nto them.  Others come forward occasionally to say that they are lurkers and <br/>\nthey just want to thank Sandra and pat her on the back. Of course they do <br/>\nthat publicly.  Folks aren&#39;t gonna come out and say they get lots of good <br/>\nstuff EXCEPT for Sandra&#39;s. They know how that would be received.  Everyone is <br/>\nnot a glutton for punishment or has those balls of steel like me.  I&#39;ve also <br/>\nsaid several times before that I gain a lot of insight, learn a lot about <br/>\nunschooling, and find much of what Sandra says useful.  I just don&#39;t find it <br/>\nuseful for her to have such an in your face, I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong, attitude <br/>\nand to personally attack folks under the guise of &quot;generally helping&quot; folks.  <br/>\nMaybe that works for some people, but for most, its a detriment to the <br/>\nunschooling lifestyle.  I&#39;ve compared Sandras radical unschooling to that of <br/>\na radical Christian.  She likes to insult and attack Christians for their <br/>\ntactics in trying to convert others, but she utilizes the same methods.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t work.  Just like the bible thumper dressed in biblical costume, holding <br/>\nup signs, standing on the street corner, shouting at sinners to REPENT, <br/>\nscreaming out scripture about hellfire and damnation does NOT persuade others <br/>\nto turn to Jesus.  In fact it causes others to turn against Christianity.   I <br/>\nthink the tactics that Sandra and her close followers use have the same <br/>\neffect on &quot;passersby &quot; that might have thought they wanted to be unschoolers, <br/>\nuntil they got it shoved down their throat evangelical style <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ll run spell check for the grammar and spelling perfectionists)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK got all the typos and commas in. Hope that helps... BTW, I am an excellent <br/>\nspeller, terrible typist.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Talk about unschooling","postDate":"1045322540","msgId":58943,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNzNDNTVCLjEzRkM1JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzNGQwMWMyZDRiYiQxZGNhZDQ4MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":58901,"nextInTopic":58946,"prevInTime":58942,"nextInTime":58944,"topicId":58723,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There were a lot of things said last night that didn t help get the list back onto the subject of unschooling.
