You simply <br/>\nreport your activities to Clonlara and they handle credits.

So <br/>\nif you have no impediments to moving to Alaska (or the next county), you can <br/>\njust go and get her.  Kids disappear and appear in U.S. schools all the time, <br/>\nand the schools just have to accept them, records or no records.  And unless <br/>\nyou&#39;re wanting the records transferred to another school (which you don&#39;t), <br/>\nyou don&#39;t even need to tell the school what you&#39;re doing right away.   She <br/>\ncan miss several days of school without it being their big business.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegistering by August (or whatever date individual states have, who have such <br/>\nrequirements) is for subsequent years.
