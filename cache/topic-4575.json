It is<br/>\nin French with English subtitles.  It was very effective in examining the French<br/>\ninvolvement in North Africa.  Not for kids though imo though older or mature<br/>\nteens might handle it okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all films are propaganda to a certain extent which is an interesting<br/>\naspect to remember and is part of the viewing of them.  Does this film confirm<br/>\nmy prejudices or does it challenge them?  Whose interest does this film serve?<br/>\nWho makes money off of this film?  Was it financially successful at the time it<br/>\nwas made.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of films which never make it in North America because they are<br/>\ntoo radical in one way or another.  They challenge people around issues of<br/>\nsexuality, morality, class issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people do not like to have their bias perturbed. I think this is an<br/>\nespecially big problem for Americans.  Americans generally have no idea<br/>\nwhatsoever how insular, provincial, and parochial they are unless they travel or<br/>\nare very widely read.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a great book from a few years ago called the &quot;Closing of the American<br/>\nMind&quot;.  People in other countries have often been living cheek by jowl with such<br/>\na mix of people for so long that they are just generally more broad in their<br/>\nviews.  Of course there striking exceptions to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the &quot;Enormous Room&quot; by e e cummings.  I am wandering off topic.  bye<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCarolyn Talarr wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Carolyn Talarr&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:talarr@...\">talarr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmm..This will be a fun list to watch build up...sticking to fascism and<br/>\n&gt; communism:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First of course, the one the only Leni Riefenstahl&#39;s &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (commissioned by Hitler, but more like fascist propaganda pretty much)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bertolucci&#39;s &quot;1900&quot; (one major storyline is the growth of the Italian<br/>\n&gt; Fascist party--fascinating film)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visconti&#39;s &quot;The Damned&quot;--about a German family in the 30s<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; from my husband:  Deutschland Bleiche Mutti (Germany, Pale Mother [or more<br/>\n&gt; like Mommy]):  from the 70s; fascism and everyday life.
