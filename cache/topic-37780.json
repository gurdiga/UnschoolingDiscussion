That last thirty seconds made<br/>\nme fall off my chair!**<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Bridget --<br/>\n<br/>\nI had read Buffy spoiler boards on the Television Without Pity website<br/>\nevery day for about six weeks leading up to the finale.  (That&#39;s<br/>\nobsession!)  So I knew what was going to happen.  Which made for a<br/>\ncompletely different viewing experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to email me offlist if you want to chat more, but be warned, I<br/>\nknow too much!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen recaps of a pretty interesting interview with one of the Buffy<br/>\nscriptwriters (Jane Espenson) who says the Spike&#39;s quest scenes were<br/>\nintentionally misleading.  Their objective was to make people fall off<br/>\nof their chairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read a lot of speculation about what Spike&#39;s personality (and hair)<br/>\nare going to be like next season.  Be warned, I can go for hours on the<br/>\nwhole Buffy and Spike topic, which has only a very tenuous connection to<br/>\nunschooling.  So I&#39;ll stop here.  For. Now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37620,"nextTopicId":37781}}
