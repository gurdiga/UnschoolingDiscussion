The publishers of Home Education<br/>\nMagazine founded and have always sponsored the list as a feature of<br/>\ntheir Unschooling.com website, but over the years this list has taken<br/>\non a life of its own and has developed far beyond the original purpose<br/>\nand intent. For that reason we, the publishers of HEM, feel this list<br/>\nneeds to be given over to those who have nurtured and cared for it,<br/>\nand who will continue to do so as the list continues to develop and grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will continue to support and encourage this list as the premier<br/>\nunschooling list it has become, but we will no longer be the list<br/>\nowners. We are transferring ownership when this message is sent, and<br/>\nthe new listowners will be posting their own message right after this<br/>\none. This list will remain associated with the Unschooling.com<br/>\nwebsite, and we will continue to advertise it in our magazine,<br/>\nnewsletters, resource listings and other resources, but it will be an<br/>\nindependent list, no longer owned by the magazine, nor officially<br/>\nrepresenting the Unschooling.com website.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne important note: The list name will change from<br/>\nUnschooling-Discussion to UnschoolingDiscussion; note that the dash<br/>\nseparating the two words will be deleted. You&#39;ll want to make note of<br/>\nthe change in your address books, email filters, etc. to avoid<br/>\nproblems down the road. The list archives will remain available<br/>\nwithout change, as will the files, photos, links and other features<br/>\nprovided by Yahoo Groups (the new owners may elect to make changes).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new Unschooling- lists created in June will remain features of the<br/>\nUnschooling.com website, owned and managed by the publishers of Home<br/>\nEducation Magazine. Those lists include: Unschooling-Cafe,<br/>\nUnschooling-Politics, Unschooling-Resources, Unschooling-Days, and<br/>\nUnschooling-Creatively. Other Unschooling-related lists will be<br/>\ncreated from time to time as interests dictate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for our old friends who might be wondering: Yes, we&#39;ll remain list<br/>\nmembers, and will join the discussion from time to time. This has<br/>\nalways been a favorite list of ours - and we&#39;re excited to see where<br/>\nthis newfound freedom takes it!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur warmest best wishes to everyone on this list as the new adventure<br/>\nbegins!<br/>\n<br/>\nKind Regards,<br/>\nMark and Helen Hegener, Publishers<br/>\nHome Education Magazine, Unschooling.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n* * * * * * * *</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79633,"nextTopicId":79646}}
