None is allergic, but if one had exzema, which I did as a kid, I KNOW I would consider the freedom to choose and to live","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-99542285\">My kids drink large amounts of milk.  None is allergic, but if one had <br/>\n  exzema, which I did as a kid, I KNOW I would consider the freedom to choose <br/>\n  and to live a more stress-free life more important than the freedom from <br/>\n  exzema.  Exzema and asthma and some other such conditions are more closely <br/>\n  correlated with emotional than dietary factors, aren&#39;t they?  Maybe all the <br/>\n  correlations and guesses in the world aren&#39;t the real answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son has both eczema and asthma.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone claim that there are emotional factors involved with them.  I have heard lots and lots of claims, and research, of the direct dietary factors involved.  My son and I don&#39;t drink milk or eat wheat.  Neither of us are allergic, but we are &quot;sensitive&quot; to them.  Without them in our diet, my son no longer has stomach cramps, night terrors, eczema, his astma is under control without drugs, and his behavior has changed significantly (we both also have Tourette Syndrome, and the behavioral &quot;co-morbidities&quot; that go along with TS have disappeared.)  My son hates his new diet, but is very, very happy with the changes that have gone on in his body.  He&#39;ll get used to the diet eventually, and there is no way that I will allow him to go back to his old ways of eating.  The diet hasn&#39;t caused me any more stress than eating the old way, it&#39;s just replaced the stress of having a sick, cranky, anxious, depressed child, with a healthy child who is generally not happy at dinner time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  BTW, even conservative Discover magazine did a cover story on the connection between ingesting large amounts of dairy products, and the high incidence of osteoporosis, alzheimers, certain cancers, MS, and several other neurological disorders.  The only groups still pushing a high dairy intake are having their research funded by the dairy lobby.  This is a case where there is a significant amount of research and correlation.  It&#39;s also a well established and completely uncontroversial fact that the majority of the world&#39;s population is lactose intolerant (3 out of 5 in European decent population, about 90-95% in non-white populations) and that injesting dairy products would hurt them.  In fact, there is a very good chance that you or your children are lactose intolerant and don&#39;t know it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Allison<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"KaqF2-BQWC8dTUd0N9FSh7RUP1grOTyFL0Fv3g6NjaHT3pu8dD_-0NdtLcZxRASjxHsjrlo63Se5FbHVbjNOtxstFkvTHy2TAfM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Deschooling--TV and Video Limits?","postDate":"1005682224","msgId":27677,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTExMzEyMDk0NC4wMWMwYTkxMEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZmIwMWMxNmM3ZCRmZTJkYTJjMCQxNjVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+","referencesHeader":"PDAxZDkwMWMxNmJkMyRkYTE1ODc0MCQ0NjFjOTNhOEBpZm5ldC5lZHU+IDw1LjAuMi4xLjAuMjAwMTExMTIxOTQ4NDguMDFjNDFjZjBAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":27673,"nextInTopic":27681,"prevInTime":27676,"nextInTime":27678,"topicId":27572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Then Skye started waking up in the morning <br/>\nasking if they could go and get one of the foods she wasn&#39;t allowed to <br/>\nhave.  She was totally obsessed with food.  My daughter finally decided to <br/>\nlet her eat what she wanted.  It wasn&#39;t a perfect solution, but it was <br/>\nbetter than the obsession.

I have two sons with food allergies.  My four year old <br/>\nis allergic to peanuts, wheat, and milk.  I have a kit that I carry <br/>\nwith me that I can use in case he accidentally eats something with <br/>\npeanuts in it and has an anaphylactic reaction.  When we go out to <br/>\neat, I ask if they fry their food in peanut oil.  If they do, he&#39;s <br/>\nnot allowed to have it.  I went through his trick or treat candy and <br/>\nread labels and took out everything that had peanuts in it.  There is <br/>\nnothing anyone could say to convince me to allow my son to eat a <br/>\npeanut butter sandwich!  I also know that if we omit milk from his <br/>\ndiet now, we may be able to keep him from developing asthma.  If it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen a few weeks since he&#39;s had milk products and there&#39;s a special <br/>\noccasion (ie, birthday cake or pizza at a birthday party), I will let <br/>\nhim have some, but then have to watch that he doesn&#39;t get any milk <br/>\nfor at least another week.  If he does, he will break out with <br/>\nexzema.  When he was a baby he spit up so much that he dropped on the <br/>\ngrowth charts because I was nursing him and I drank milk.  When he <br/>\nwas a toddler, he had exzema that he would scratch at night and there <br/>\nwould be blood on the sheets from it the next morning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy two year old is also allergic to milk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I&#39;ve learned about food allergies is that people tend <br/>\nto crave what they&#39;re allergic to.  I also believe that kids are <br/>\nallergic to foods more often than people realize.  You should always <br/>\nsuspect food allergies with exzema, chronic ear infections, colic, <br/>\nbabies spitting up excessively, asthma, acne, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou won&#39;t be seeing me allowing my kids to control their diet any <br/>\ntime soon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, suppose you daughter decides to eat nothing but celery.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>All celery<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; ever day.

That<br/>\nall, as she put it &quot;negative behaviors&quot; would be outgrown and no harm would<br/>\ncome from them learning from their mistakes.  She &quot;was&quot; a 100% died in the<br/>\nwool unschooler complete with family bed, home births, all the television<br/>\nand video games they want, no limits on anything, etc., etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has hence decided that children do not always know what is best for them<br/>\nand that all situations must be looked at on an individual basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 12, 2001 12:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Deschooling--TV and Video Limits?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/12/01 1:27:21 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Ever hear of a little known disorder called ANOREXIA?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever heard of a homeschooled girl who went to<br/>\neating<br/>\n&gt; all CELERY.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Maybe some of you were more secure, but I didn&#39;t want anyone to<br/>\nthink I was a bad mother.  The video game issue was probably the hardest<br/>\nbecause my sil was here when the Playstation arrived.  She would say  &quot;<br/>\nAre you STILL playing that?&quot;  and &quot;Are you just going to let him sit<br/>\nthere all day?&quot;   Well, yes, I did, and he played all day, every day, for<br/>\ndays and days, until HE decided HE was finished and wanted to move on to<br/>\nsomething else.  People have raised their eyebrows more than once in our<br/>\ndirection about how much TV he can watch, what he can watch, no bed<br/>\ntimes, etc.  But I hear constantly about what an exceptional child he is<br/>\nand how smart he is.  Well, he&#39;s smart because no one&#39;s stomping him<br/>\ndown, telling him constantly by controlling him, that he&#39;s NOT smart<br/>\nenough to make his own choices.  IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it with another boy too.  A neighbor boy who is always in<br/>\ntrouble at school and was considered such a handful other neighbors even<br/>\nwarned me about him.  He loves coming to our house because he can do<br/>\nwhatever he wants.  And you know what?  He doesn&#39;t do anything horrible. <br/>\nHe&#39;s a really fun kid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHis folks used to lock him out of his house too, by the way.  When I<br/>\nfigured out what was going on, I  said, why don&#39;t you just tell him he<br/>\ncan come to my house after school?   She said they locked him out because<br/>\nhe ate everything in the house and then wouldn&#39;t eat any dinner.  <br/>\nI told her I&#39;d have something nutritious for him, then if he snacked, it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be a big deal.   They stopped locking him out.  And now if he&#39;s<br/>\nhome by himself he knows he can call me if he needs something.  Usually<br/>\nhe just comes over here, and we&#39;re glad to see him.  At our house he is<br/>\nNOT the &quot;monster&quot; he is at school, and I believe it&#39;s because he knows we<br/>\nlike and respect him, and believe he&#39;s a good person.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zayzUDndlXt6kAwtsxum-sgMNK6LucZLKLlYCh1fSTSUk8rjfve8DUvtduL0btNkUhI52WNvFGk","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Deschooling--TV and Video Limits?","postDate":"1005524707","msgId":27581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTExLjE3MjUyMS4tMjc5Njg5LjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27577,"nextInTopic":27588,"prevInTime":27580,"nextInTime":27582,"topicId":27572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sun, 11 Nov 2001 15:49:41 -0500 Bonnie M.
