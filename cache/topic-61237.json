For those of you who might not have heard it, I<br/>\nwanted to share.  What follows is the transcript from NPR.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNational Public Radio<br/>\nAll Things Considered <br/>\n<br/>\nMarch 13, 2003 <br/>\n<br/>\nCommentary: Illogical reasoning of a war against Iraq <br/>\n<br/>\nEdition: 9:00-10:00 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nEstimated printed pages: 2 <br/>\n<br/>\nArticle Text: <br/>\n<br/>\nMICHELE NORRIS, host: <br/>\n<br/>\nThe deliberations at the UN over possible military action in Iraq have<br/>\nfeatured thousands of pages of documents and hours and hours of debate,<br/>\nnot to mention all the press conferences, Op-Ed articles and pure<br/>\nspeculation that have filled the airwaves in the last few months. But<br/>\neven after all of that evidence and discussion, commentator Peter<br/>\nFreundlich still wants to express the trouble he&#39;s having trying to make<br/>\nsense of the argument to go to war. <br/>\n<br/>\nPETER FREUNDLICH: <br/>\n<br/>\nAll right, let me see if I understand the logic of this correctly. We<br/>\nare going to ignore the United Nations in order to make clear to Saddam<br/>\nHussein that the United Nations cannot be ignored. We&#39;re going to wage<br/>\nwar to preserve the UN&#39;s ability to avert war. The paramount principle<br/>\nis that the UN&#39;s word must be taken seriously, and if we have to subvert<br/>\nits word to guarantee that it is, then by gum, we will. Peace is too<br/>\nimportant not to take up arms to defend. Am I getting this right? <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, if the only way to bring democracy to Iraq is to vitiate the<br/>\ndemocracy of the Security Council, then we are honor-bound to do that<br/>\ntoo, because democracy, as we define it, is too important to be stopped<br/>\nby a little thing like democracy as they define it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in dealing with a man who brooks no dissension at home, we cannot<br/>\nafford dissension among ourselves. We must speak with one voice against<br/>\nSaddam Hussein&#39;s failure to allow opposing voices to be heard. We are<br/>\nsending our gathered might to the Persian Gulf to make the point that<br/>\nmight does not make right, as Saddam Hussein seems to think it does. And<br/>\nwe are twisting the arms of the opposition until it agrees to let us<br/>\noust a regime that twists the arms of the opposition. We cannot leave in<br/>\npower a dictator who ignores his own people. And if our people, and<br/>\npeople elsewhere in the world, fail to understand that, then we have no<br/>\nchoice but to ignore them. <br/>\n<br/>\nListen. Don&#39;t misunderstand. I think it is a good thing that the members<br/>\nof the Bush administration seem to have been reading Lewis Carroll. I<br/>\nonly wish someone had pointed out that &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; are meditations on paradox and puzzle and<br/>\nillogic and on the strangeness of things, not templates for foreign<br/>\npolicy. It is amusing for the Mad Hatter to say something like, `We must<br/>\nmake war on him because he is a threat to peace,&#39; but not amusing for<br/>\nsomeone who actually commands an army to say that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a collector of laughable arguments, I&#39;d be enjoying all this were it<br/>\nnot for the fact that I know--we all know--that lives are going to be<br/>\nlost in what amounts to a freak, circular reasoning accident. <br/>\n<br/>\nNORRIS: Peter Freundlich is a freelance journalist in New York.<br/>\nTomorrow, we will hear a different view about the appropriate use of<br/>\nmilitary force. <br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright C2003 National Public RadioR.
