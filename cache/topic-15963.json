Toy guns are just bits of plastic. I imagine there<br/>\n&gt; are amazingly well-made fakes out there that until you lifted them you<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t really tell, but that&#39;s not your run of the mill Toys R Us<br/>\nspecial.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is not to say I think carrying around fake guns that look at all real<br/>\n&gt; is a good idea. In the home, in the yard, no problem. In the car, out and<br/>\n&gt; about, there is IMHO a risk that at a quick and nervous glance people<br/>\nwon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know which is which.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I always find it interesting that people focus on whether there are guns<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; the house when they send their kids &quot;over to play&quot;. I&#39;d be a lot more<br/>\n&gt; interested to know if there were child abusers, including people who shout<br/>\n&gt; at or hit their own children (this kind of uproar would terrify mine), or<br/>\n&gt; large untrained dogs, or many other hazards. By the time my children are<br/>\nold<br/>\n&gt; enough to &quot;go visiting&quot; alone, guns will be (already are) old and boring<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday at the state fair, my almost-4 year old was thrown about 5 feet<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; the whack of a cow&#39;s large, heavy and irritated head swinging into her. It<br/>\n&gt; knocked the wind out of her, bloodied her nose, and scared her to bits.<br/>\n&gt; After that experience, I&#39;m more worried about accessible cattle and folks<br/>\n&gt; who don&#39;t necessarily know what they&#39;re doing, like me: I stupidly let her<br/>\n&gt; stand at the side of the cow pen where she could get hit instead of<br/>\ndirectly<br/>\n&gt; in front where the structure of the pen would prevent it. I didn&#39;t know<br/>\ncows<br/>\n&gt; DID that -- none of us standing there knew it -- but my daughters know<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; guns do. They didn&#39;t know not to stand to the side of a cow, they do know<br/>\n&gt; not to point a gun at someone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of people think their dogs won&#39;t bite and don&#39;t ever see the warning<br/>\n&gt; signs until a kid gets half his face bitten off. &quot;He turned on him without<br/>\n&gt; warning&quot; is a fairy tale. 99.9% of severe dogs bites can be seen coming a<br/>\n&gt; mile away if you know what you&#39;re looking at. In 12 years of dog training<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; a profession, specializing in aggression problems, I was surprise-bitten<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; one dog. She was just-plain-nuts, and that happens hardly ever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is not to say that guns are harmless, or should be taken lightly, but<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; think they get taken too heavily, too. You can&#39;t just say, &quot;be careful of<br/>\n&gt; guns&quot;, you have to live careful of guns, and raise children who care about<br/>\n&gt; taking care with anything of potential danger -- guns, dogs, cattle,<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; who scream at children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

The reserach has already been done and that is why laws have<br/>\n&gt; been passed about what toy guns can look like.  Not that it has done much<br/>\n&gt; good so far!  AND, since even the cops can&#39;t tell the difference between<br/>\n&gt; real guns and play guns in some instances, I seriously doubt that a child<br/>\n&gt; can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At a distance, when someone is pretending a fake gun is real and pointing it<br/>\nswiftly at you, in a tense situation, in poor lighting, with fear as a<br/>\nfactor, if you forgot your glasses and were not close enough to see the<br/>\nmuscles involved in holding up a real gun vs. a fake one, you can make this<br/>\nmistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at a real and a fake next to each other in decent lighting up close,<br/>\nand definitely by lifting one, it&#39;s very, very easy to tell the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuns are heavy and bulky with real bulk and feel and look and smell like<br/>\nsolid, serious weapons. Toy guns are just bits of plastic. I imagine there<br/>\nare amazingly well-made fakes out there that until you lifted them you<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t really tell, but that&#39;s not your run of the mill Toys R Us special.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to say I think carrying around fake guns that look at all real<br/>\nis a good idea. In the home, in the yard, no problem. In the car, out and<br/>\nabout, there is IMHO a risk that at a quick and nervous glance people won&#39;t<br/>\nknow which is which.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always find it interesting that people focus on whether there are guns in<br/>\nthe house when they send their kids &quot;over to play&quot;. I&#39;d be a lot more<br/>\ninterested to know if there were child abusers, including people who shout<br/>\nat or hit their own children (this kind of uproar would terrify mine), or<br/>\nlarge untrained dogs, or many other hazards. By the time my children are old<br/>\nenough to &quot;go visiting&quot; alone, guns will be (already are) old and boring to<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday at the state fair, my almost-4 year old was thrown about 5 feet by<br/>\nthe whack of a cow&#39;s large, heavy and irritated head swinging into her. It<br/>\nknocked the wind out of her, bloodied her nose, and scared her to bits.<br/>\nAfter that experience, I&#39;m more worried about accessible cattle and folks<br/>\nwho don&#39;t necessarily know what they&#39;re doing, like me: I stupidly let her<br/>\nstand at the side of the cow pen where she could get hit instead of directly<br/>\nin front where the structure of the pen would prevent it. I didn&#39;t know cows<br/>\nDID that -- none of us standing there knew it -- but my daughters know what<br/>\nguns do. They didn&#39;t know not to stand to the side of a cow, they do know<br/>\nnot to point a gun at someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people think their dogs won&#39;t bite and don&#39;t ever see the warning<br/>\nsigns until a kid gets half his face bitten off. &quot;He turned on him without<br/>\nwarning&quot; is a fairy tale. 99.9% of severe dogs bites can be seen coming a<br/>\nmile away if you know what you&#39;re looking at. In 12 years of dog training as<br/>\na profession, specializing in aggression problems, I was surprise-bitten by<br/>\none dog. She was just-plain-nuts, and that happens hardly ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to say that guns are harmless, or should be taken lightly, but I<br/>\nthink they get taken too heavily, too. You can&#39;t just say, &quot;be careful of<br/>\nguns&quot;, you have to live careful of guns, and raise children who care about<br/>\ntaking care with anything of potential danger -- guns, dogs, cattle, people<br/>\nwho scream at children.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Shona Jesta Dunning","from":"Shona Jesta Dunning &lt;mummranch@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4lIFSHHt2HDdLc9VUceEOa8MY-Gbq58BWtq7lRCk2KCDhGHxVOiUPyVgIdPiGPUPmQj5VxO_TAj77ThWFJbAlxjUUBfju9zGRkxWHFpBSIHk","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] guns","postDate":"999223559","msgId":23920,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMTA4MzAyMDA0MjYuMDIwMmZiMDBAcG9wLnBsYWlucy5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWMxMmZlMyQxMDBhYTdlMCRiZDZiMWIzZkBkZWZhdWx0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":23816,"nextInTopic":23930,"prevInTime":23919,"nextInTime":23921,"topicId":15963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry so later in giving my 2 cents worth, but we are getting ready to go to the Colorado State Fair, where my son has qualified in 4-h Shooting Sport.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-935730188\">Sorry so later in giving my 2 cents worth, but we are getting ready to go <br/>\nto the Colorado State Fair, where my son has qualified in 4-h Shooting <br/>\nSport.

I&#39;m assuming that by the word &quot;gun&quot; in this statement you <br/>\nmean a toy gun?  I don&#39;t really care much if my kids play with toy guns.  I <br/>\nwould even buy them one if they couldn&#39;t be gently persuaded to something <br/>\nelse.  I just give it as little attention as possible which, so far, has had <br/>\nthe desired effect, they aren&#39;t interested in them.<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;In such a case, I would recommend for my kids say &quot;I don&#39;t want to be <br/>\naround <br/>\n guns, so I&#39;m going home,&quot; or just &quot;I&#39;m going home now.&quot;   Dishonesty, even <br/>\nto <br/>\n oneself, is a harm that goes soul deep and can affect those who&#39;ve never had <br/>\n a toy gon or a game with a picture of a gun.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree on the damage that lying causes.  This is the reason that until my dd <br/>\nreached a point of reason she simply never went alone to a home that I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ncertain about.  That means that I knew the parents VERY well, knew they had <br/>\nno guns for one thing.  Honesty is ALL situations was taught and modeled.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the actions and choice of words for this situation were carefully <br/>\nthought out and considered.  I also waited for a time of maturity when my dd <br/>\nwould be able to separate the honest person she is from a moment of crisis <br/>\nthat may call for lying.  Yes, I do believe there are rare events which a <br/>\nhigher calling takes precedence.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday my dd and I were discussing the &quot;Black Market&quot; and what it <br/>\nmeans.  I explained that it is generally used for illegal activity and greed. <br/>\n I added that it has been used for good but rarely.  From here we discussed <br/>\nWWII and the Nazi occupation in Europe and how some folks used the BM to <br/>\nobtain goods, food and medication to do good, like aiding Jews in hiding.  <br/>\nShe was shocked to learn that I was in agreement with this kind of action.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom here we went discussed civil disobedience and lying for a greater good.  <br/>\nIt was an opportunity for me to restate MY beliefs on this issue.  Deciding <br/>\nto take an action like this requires brutal honesty in self-examination <br/>\nbecause the temptation to do this for selfish reasons is strong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two reasons for advising her to use this particular statement, worded the <br/>\nway it is are:<br/>\n1)  To avoid any hesitation on her part.  It can be hard for a kid to take a <br/>\nstand and even though she is usually good at this, I don&#39;t want her to wait <br/>\neven a few seconds before getting out of there.<br/>\n2)  To avoid the other kids from trying to stop her from leaving.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant them to stand in her way or try to persuade her because they are afraid <br/>\nshes going to &quot;tell&quot; or get them in trouble somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, I am sure that I want her to &quot;lie&quot; to get out of there and we have <br/>\ndiscussed &quot;why&quot; in detail, more than once.  I would rather she violate her <br/>\nown conscience in a moment like this than risk death.  I&#39;ve also told her <br/>\nthat she can say or do ANYTHING if she is in a dangerous situation, ie; being <br/>\napproached by someone whom she feels is threatening.  A few months ago she <br/>\nwas on the sidewalk and a man pulled up next to her in a car and began to <br/>\ntalk to her.  She was caught off guard and blurted, &quot;Thats my mom calling!&quot; <br/>\nand ran away.  Yes she could have just run but maybe she needed to say that <br/>\nto get her feet moving.

They were there for sentimental<br/>\n&gt; reasons and were old. My <br/>\n&gt; Dad did not hunt or own a gun that worked but as a<br/>\n&gt; kid he did hunt. I loved <br/>\n&gt; guns as a kid. Not sure why. I had a cool pop gun<br/>\n&gt; and at 5 talked my Mom into <br/>\n&gt; letting me have a cowboy suit, complete with holster<br/>\n&gt; and guns. Her main <br/>\n&gt; concern was that the pants zipped up the front. ( I<br/>\n&gt; remember her talking to <br/>\n&gt; her friends about whether it would be improper to<br/>\n&gt; let me own such a pair of <br/>\n&gt; pants) My, haven&#39;t times changed. My brothers both<br/>\n&gt; had BB guns but by the <br/>\n&gt; time I was old enough to have one I had lost my gun<br/>\n&gt; interest and replaced it <br/>\n&gt; with an interest in animals. I was upset that anyone<br/>\n&gt; would hunt them. ( both <br/>\n&gt; my brothers lost their interests in guns too) My<br/>\n&gt; husband grew up with hunting <br/>\n&gt; being a big part of his life. His family depended on<br/>\n&gt; his Father&#39;s ability to <br/>\n&gt; hunt in the winter months when he was laid off work.<br/>\n&gt; All the boy&#39;s hunted and <br/>\n&gt; it was certainly a different kind of life than the<br/>\n&gt; one I was raised in. It <br/>\n&gt; was liked they lived in a different time period!<br/>\n&gt; When our oldest son became <br/>\n&gt; fascinated with guns we let him have toy guns. And<br/>\n&gt; then when he was 11 he got <br/>\n&gt; a BB gun. My husband, who seldom has time to hunt<br/>\n&gt; now, was looking forward to <br/>\n&gt; hunting with the oldest someday. He spent a lot time<br/>\n&gt; teaching the kids gun <br/>\n&gt; safety, they all like to target practice with Dad.<br/>\n&gt; Then a funny thing <br/>\n&gt; happened to the oldest boy called Animal Planet. He<br/>\n&gt; loves the shows on that <br/>\n&gt; channel. And now he loves animals and has no desire<br/>\n&gt; to hunt them. My husband <br/>\n&gt; was very disappointed. Second son never had an<br/>\n&gt; interest in guns or hunting. <br/>\n&gt; And the girls do not either. So you never know how<br/>\n&gt; things will turn out. I <br/>\n&gt; personally do not like guns and now the only guns we<br/>\n&gt; have in the house are <br/>\n&gt; black powder which my husband uses to hunt deer, if<br/>\n&gt; he has time. So I guess <br/>\n&gt; you never know how it is going to turn out. <br/>\n&gt; peace and grace <br/>\n&gt; Candy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

But sometimes he does<br/>\nsee some violent game (I&#39;m talking fighting now, not<br/>\nshooting...) and want to get in on it. My natural<br/>\ninclinations is &quot;AAAGGGHH!!! no no no!!!&quot; But thanks<br/>\nto a very logical boyfriend who reminds me of that<br/>\nwhole forbidden fruit thing and how he&#39;ll just want it<br/>\nand try to sneak to do it eventually if I be a freak<br/>\nabout it, then sometimes I&#39;ll indulge him and come to<br/>\nfind out he never asks again. It&#39;s like he has his own<br/>\ndistaste for violence when it comes down to it. I&#39;m<br/>\nglad for that. <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to find a balance, instead of one extreme or<br/>\nthe other. For example my cousin&#39;s son only almost<br/>\nONLY toy guns. ONLY plays violent, graphicly gory<br/>\ngames, and everything else seems boring to him. He&#39;s a<br/>\nnice kid, other than he only wants to pretend he&#39;s<br/>\nshooting you. He&#39;s alot older than Tori and I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember him being like that when he was younger, but<br/>\nALL restrictions on anything like that were removed to<br/>\nnot make it more fascinating and it&#39;s a &quot;phase&quot; he has<br/>\nnot gotten over yet. But I know kids who have far TOO<br/>\nMANY restrictions and are so happy to go over to<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s house so they can play something &quot;fun&quot;<br/>\nwithout thier parents around. <br/>\nah to be a discerning parent. :)<br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think the point that was being made was that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; possible to cause someone <br/>\n&gt; to want something by not letting them even see or<br/>\n&gt; touch one.

He owned a rifle or two and had a really old cool<br/>\nlooking pistol, was really really into the &quot;old west&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;cowboy shows&quot; as my son called them, and my son<br/>\nthe first time he saw him watching one was shocked cuz<br/>\ngrampa was such a kind gentle man he would never think<br/>\nthat he enjoyed watching shows where people got shot.<br/>\nThe way I resolved that was to explain that things<br/>\nwere much different back then &quot;cowboy dayz&quot;, and the<br/>\nsame way cops have to carry guns now, everyone back<br/>\nthen had thier own guns. It&#39;s funny that you mentioned<br/>\ncoyotes and rattlers cuz i also explained that to him,<br/>\nas did my dad. If you were out in the desert and you<br/>\ncame upon one you might need to defend yourself. But<br/>\nhe also understands that that would be in a complete<br/>\nlife or death defend yourself situation that you would<br/>\nshoot any animal, or if you were stranded somewhere<br/>\nand needed food. Not hunting for sport. We live near a<br/>\nstore where we can buy meat from animals that have<br/>\nalready been killed, there is no reason for us to go<br/>\nshoot some more. My dad got rid of his guns when my<br/>\nson was born and we lived with them for awhile. He<br/>\nalso stopped hunting. He looked at it through his<br/>\ngrandson&#39;s eyes and couldn&#39;t see a way to explain to<br/>\nhim why he would have a gun in the house or why he<br/>\nwould go and shoot any of the animals that I was<br/>\nteaching him to cherish when our freezer already had<br/>\nmeat in it. But I agree that it is affected alot by<br/>\nwhere you&#39;re from. My family are very much &quot;hicks&quot; (as<br/>\nI affectionately call us), my dad was a &quot;good ol boy&quot;<br/>\nand was guns and hunting was just passed down to him<br/>\nas a normal part of life, (but he also remembered that<br/>\nthe first time he saw an animal shot when he was<br/>\nlittle it was very hard for him to accept that it was<br/>\nok to do and said it changed him quite a bit.) and<br/>\nwild west shtuff will always be around us. And I&#39;m<br/>\nglad. It reminds me of my darling gentle sweet dad who<br/>\npassed away less than a year ago. But we don&#39;t LIVE in<br/>\nthe wild west anymore. <br/>\nCowboyz did alot of other cool things too, besides<br/>\nshooting. My son loves to play cowboy and never does<br/>\nit involve a gun. <br/>\nBut like I said to each his own. I agree that people<br/>\nwho do like them should be allowed to have them, but I<br/>\nalso believe it should be much more regulated, so not<br/>\njust any ol violence crazed person can get a gun out<br/>\nof the paper for &quot;target practice&quot; that is basically<br/>\ntraining them in the art of taking another life.

They were there for sentimental reasons and were old. My <br/>\nDad did not hunt or own a gun that worked but as a kid he did hunt. I loved <br/>\nguns as a kid. Not sure why. I had a cool pop gun and at 5 talked my Mom into <br/>\nletting me have a cowboy suit, complete with holster and guns. Her main <br/>\nconcern was that the pants zipped up the front.

My brothers both had BB guns but by the <br/>\ntime I was old enough to have one I had lost my gun interest and replaced it <br/>\nwith an interest in animals. I was upset that anyone would hunt them. ( both <br/>\nmy brothers lost their interests in guns too) My husband grew up with hunting <br/>\nbeing a big part of his life. His family depended on his Father&#39;s ability to <br/>\nhunt in the winter months when he was laid off work.

My husband, who seldom has time to hunt now, was looking forward to <br/>\nhunting with the oldest someday. He spent a lot time teaching the kids gun <br/>\nsafety, they all like to target practice with Dad. Then a funny thing <br/>\nhappened to the oldest boy called Animal Planet. He loves the shows on that <br/>\nchannel. And now he loves animals and has no desire to hunt them. My husband <br/>\nwas very disappointed. Second son never had an interest in guns or hunting. <br/>\nAnd the girls do not either. So you never know how things will turn out. I <br/>\npersonally do not like guns and now the only guns we have in the house are <br/>\nblack powder which my husband uses to hunt deer, if he has time.
