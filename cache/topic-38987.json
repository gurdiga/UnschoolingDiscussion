Luz and I unschooled our son and send a newsletter (just<br/>\nask for it -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a> ) about unschooling, and have long said that<br/>\nit&#39;s the parents who need to know that they are the ones who need to   UN-<br/>\nlearn what they think about how children become educated. Most adults cannot<br/>\nimagine a life without schooling, so when they consider homeschooling, most<br/>\nof them believe that it means doing school at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren do not need to go through that change of thinking -- they simply<br/>\nneed to be allowed to continue what they&#39;ve been doing since they were born,<br/>\nwhich is learning at an incredible pace how the world around them works.<br/>\nFrom our Unschooling experience with our son, now 23, academic basics are<br/>\nlearned simply by being alive and involved in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe introduction to our info packet, written by Luz, is as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Unschooling?<br/>\n Unschooling is trusting the learner to be in charge of his or her own<br/>\nlearning. It is not a method of instruction we use on our children, but a<br/>\nprocess we adults go through to unlearn the lessons and undo the effects of<br/>\nour  years of schooling.<br/>\n Schooling taught us that learning only happens in a certain place and time,<br/>\nunder the direction and/or force of a teacher.<br/>\n Unschooling ourselves restores our child-like curiosity. It encourages us<br/>\nto trust that we are all learning all the time and that we are the experts<br/>\nwhen it comes to choosing what, when, how, where, how much and with whom we<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n Schooling taught us that our interests were unimportant, disruptive, a<br/>\nwaste of time, just play, not ³the real world.²<br/>\n Unschooling frees us to follow our interests wherever they lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38974,"nextTopicId":38985}}
