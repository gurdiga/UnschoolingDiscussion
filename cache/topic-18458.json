As I speak, DS is building a pirate fort in the living room<br/>\nand DD is scattering crayons to kingdom come.<br/>\nI used to think that too  - that people couldn&#39;t possibly interact with<br/>\ntheir kids and have a clean house (confessions of a former un-housekeeper,<br/>\nmess-a-holic :-). My husband is a very neat and tidy guy and over the years<br/>\nhas showed me how to keep a clean house most of the time. Sure, the kids&#39;<br/>\ntoys are still out sometimes, but we have little routines that keep it all<br/>\nin order. Anyone going upstairs carries toys or clean laundry and puts it<br/>\naway, anyone coming downstairs brings dirty laundry, or anything else that<br/>\nneeds to come down. Before we get anything new out, we clean up the old mess<br/>\n(unless it is going to be used later - the pirate fort will probably stay up<br/>\nfor awhile, but the crayons will get picked up before we go on to anything<br/>\nelse). In the evening, we have a little picking up routine so that the house<br/>\nis in order when we wake up in the morning. Any given room usually takes<br/>\nless than 5 minutes to straighten out. In the morning, I clean the kitchen<br/>\nup while the kids eat breakfast, and straighten up the bathroom after<br/>\neveryone&#39;s all washed up. The kids take their dishes to the sink and hang up<br/>\ntheir towels and such.<br/>\nI must confess that I love having the house so organized and I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t miss doing the panic drill if someone is coming over to visit :-). My<br/>\nmom was like that when I was a kid and I just hated it! That and the<br/>\nmarathon house or room-cleaning sessions because everything had gotten in<br/>\nsuch a terrible state, or the fact that we could never find anything we were<br/>\nlooking for. I remember my mom trying to bribe me into keeping my room<br/>\nclean, at the same time that the rest of the house was always a total mess<br/>\n(we only ate dinner on the dining room table during holidays, the rest of<br/>\nthe time it was a repository). She never taught me by example the skills<br/>\nnecessary to just *keep* a clean house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But maybe that&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; how all kids are. Mine are though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids learn from example. If you&#39;re not a tidy housekeeper, they won&#39;t learn<br/>\nthe skills either. I&#39;m not saying this is necessarily true for you, but it<br/>\nmight be one reason they&#39;re &quot;not that way&quot;. I was never great at picking up<br/>\nmy room (as my folks like to remind me, it was pretty much a trash heap),<br/>\nbut now I&#39;m good at it, it&#39;s a learned attribute. Kids that live in a house<br/>\nwhere people cheerfully put in the daily work to keep it neat also learn<br/>\nthose skills. Now whether or not they take root for awhile might depend more<br/>\non personality and such, but without the example the skills never have a<br/>\nchance. I have to say I am convinced that in the long run it takes far less<br/>\ntime and effort to keep a house clean than to clean it after it has gotten<br/>\nfairly messy and dirty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I figure as long as it&#39;s not dangerous and/or<br/>\n&gt; unsanitary then I&#39;m not going to waste my energy<br/>\n&gt; picking up allll day long everyday. What a grouch I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; be! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Honestly, I used to hate housework too but now I love it. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow/why/when I made the switch. Maybe just from having a clean house and<br/>\nwanting to keep it that way. I now find I&#39;m way grouchier in a cluttered<br/>\nroom (like my office is right now, LOL!) than I am in a clean one. Choosing<br/>\nto make housework a joy was somewhat of a conscious choice for me. And the<br/>\nmore joyous about it I am, the more fun my kids have with it. We make<br/>\neverything a game and they actually beg (!!!!) to scrub toilets or floors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying anyone should or must change or even that it&#39;s better to have<br/>\na clean rather than a cluttery place. Just sharing my own journey. But if<br/>\nanyone is interested in a great system for learning how to joyfully keep a<br/>\nclean house, I&#39;d recommend <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.FlyLady.net\">http://www.FlyLady.net</a> . I&#39;m trying to get my mom<br/>\nto do this as every time we visit her, we have to spend 5 minutes cleaning<br/>\noff the table before we can eat on it, and 10 minutes cleaning the kitchen<br/>\nbefore we can cook, and, and, and..... And then there&#39;s my grandma. She&#39;s<br/>\ngot tons of boxes scattered around her house filled with all kinds of just<br/>\nstuff. The boxes are marked &quot;DSA&quot; (for &quot;Do Something About&quot;) and some are<br/>\ndated from 30 or 40 years ago. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;My pants are outgrowing me&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Potty pee!
