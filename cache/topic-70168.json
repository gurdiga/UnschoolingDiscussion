We had the most wonderful evening.  <br/>\nI took the kids to the beach with a friend and her kids.  It was low <br/>\ntide with a mild breeze and the water was like a bath.  The kids were <br/>\nLOVING the water and rolling in the sand down the sand hills.  Sand <br/>\ncovering every square inch of their bodies..LOL!!  We walked back to <br/>\nthe car with the boys wrapped in their towels and naked butt cheeks.  <br/>\nThat is one of those moments that stands out and you will forever <br/>\nremember or would be heartbroken to forget.  I felt such peace <br/>\ntonight.  No stress over reading or writing.  NO concerns with <br/>\nschools and the associated playmates.  Just great fun with our <br/>\nfriends enjoying our community and eachother.  I am going to sleep <br/>\nlike a baby, which my boys are doing now.  This peace comes from <br/>\nunschooling so I want to thank everyone for their general support and <br/>\nconstant praises of their own kids.  Those posts give me the <br/>\nconfidence I need everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70165,"nextTopicId":70173}}
