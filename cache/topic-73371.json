What I want to point out<br/>\nis that your son may always be inclined toward doing more physical things.<br/>\nThis is absolutely not a bad thing.  I&#39;ve been reading that, at least in<br/>\nCanada and probably also in the States, blue collar workers are going to be<br/>\nat a premium in a few years.  So many parents and teachers and counsellors<br/>\nhave been pushing academics over vocational training for so long that there<br/>\njust aren&#39;t all that many younger blue collar workers.  It&#39;s stupid for two<br/>\nreasons.  For one, there&#39;s now going to be a shortage.  For the other, there<br/>\nare always going to be kids who aren&#39;t academically oriented.  They can be<br/>\nvery successful doing the kinds of physical things they like to do, so why<br/>\npush them in directions that don&#39;t suit them?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 15 year old son is a lot like your boy, and he&#39;s never been to school.<br/>\nHis passions are team sports and mountain biking.  He&#39;s spent a lot of time<br/>\non his computer searching out biking information and pricing bike parts.<br/>\nThat and his bike mags are about the only reading he does, but he can now<br/>\nread anything he chooses to read.  (He only learned at age 12.)  I&#39;m happy<br/>\nwith that.  His spelling is still terrible, and it&#39;s starting to bother him.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t bother him enough to want to do anything about it yet, but I<br/>\nthink he&#39;s leaning that way.  And even if he doesn&#39;t, he can always get one<br/>\nof those Franklin spelling machines.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis interest in biking has led to watching biking videos a lot, which has<br/>\nled to an interest in film-making, especially the editing aspect  Maybe<br/>\nhe&#39;ll do something with that one day.  He already knows enough about fixing<br/>\nbikes that the local bike store owner would hire him if he had enough<br/>\nbusiness.  I can see him owning his own bike store one day.  I can also see<br/>\nhim running an eco-tourism business (very big here on Vancouver Island).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s worked off and on for his dad doing forestry work and knows he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to make his living that way, but he could if he had to.  Which brings<br/>\nme to the lazy, unmotivated comment.  My son *looks* lazy and unmotivated at<br/>\ntimes.  When he isn&#39;t working he&#39;ll sometimes watch TV for days straight.<br/>\nBut when he starts working, he seems much happier.  He likes the challenge<br/>\nof making as much money as he can.  (The forestry work is piece-work.  They<br/>\nget paid by the hectare or number of trees or whatever, depends what they&#39;re<br/>\ndoing.)  He jumps right out of the crummy when it gets to the job site and<br/>\nstarts working right away.  The older workers sit around smoking and<br/>\ndrinking coffee for half an hour, with frequent smoke and coffee breaks<br/>\nthrough the day.  Then they bitch and complain if he makes more money than<br/>\nthey do.  He likes feeling competent and needed.  Maybe your son needs help<br/>\nfinding work that would make him feel competent and useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the best thing you can do for your son is much like what everyone else<br/>\nhas said.  See him as smart, competent, motivated, and interesting.  Give<br/>\nhim time to deschool, but don&#39;t expect that he *will* turn to academics.  He<br/>\nmay never do much in that area, but he *can* be very successful, especially<br/>\nwith your support.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":234387,"authorName":"Andrea","from":"Andrea &lt;andrea@...&gt;","profile":"runmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Myers-Briggs...was Am I just  thick?","postDate":"1055263704","msgId":73491,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjUuMS4yMDAzMDYxMDEzNDc0NC4wMjE5NWRkMEBwb3AxLm5zLnN5bXBhdGljby5jYT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFRTVGN0QyLjFDOUYyNzdDQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWMzMmY0MyRhN2M2NDhkMCQ2NDAwYThjMEB5b3Vyam9ua3c2OHRseT4="},"prevInTopic":73478,"nextInTopic":73494,"prevInTime":73490,"nextInTime":73492,"topicId":73371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There is no greater insight into <br/>\nthe <br/>\nfuture than recognizing when we save our children, we save ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting that you would have this as a sig line.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I read in your email is frustration over today and panic about <br/>\ntomorrow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe what you all need to do is take ONE day at a time, and just <br/>\nlive that day, together...doing whatever makes it a pleasant and <br/>\nhappy day for all of you.  Remember when you gazed on that baby boy <br/>\nand just loved him and everything was a significant milestone in the <br/>\nright direction?  Try doing that again.  See him as wonderful, even <br/>\nas he is.  When you believe in him, he&#39;ll believe in himself.<br/>\nHe may be 15 and full of bravado, but believe me, he still looks to <br/>\nyou to see how he measures up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you string a bunch of happy days together, not only do you have <br/>\na happy LIFE, but your whole perspective begins to change (and so <br/>\nwill his).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was very young and I didn&#39;t know any better, we saw a <br/>\npsychologist, who had a 15 year old boy at the time.  I was scared to <br/>\ndeath for my son&#39;s future, even then.  One of the things the <br/>\npsychologist told me was that if you take each day at a time, and <br/>\ntake each thing as it comes, and work on each one, the future will <br/>\ntake care of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my son is almost 15.  And you know what?  The psychologist was <br/>\nright.  My son is not perfect.  He is still somewhat immature and <br/>\nimpulsive (as he should be!) and he is currently of the belief that <br/>\nhe should be himself at all costs, no matter how offensive it might <br/>\nbe to others.  But I remember being the same way at that age.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of worrying that he will alienate himself out of a future <br/>\njob, or a future &quot;education&quot;, I realize now that this personality <br/>\ntrait is what makes a critical thinker, a lobbiest, an activist, an <br/>\ninventer, a philosopher, and/or a catalyst for change in the world.  <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll never do anything with that skill but vote his <br/>\nconscience.  The point is, its a good trait to have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of worrying about what your son is *not* doing...think about <br/>\nwhat he *is* doing and all the possibilities there are in the future <br/>\nfor him to utilize those traits and skills.  There is no such thing <br/>\nas a negative character trait.  EVERY character trait has good uses <br/>\nand bad uses.  Its a choice, but that choice is based on how we see <br/>\nourselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou say your son is &quot;lazy&quot;.  But could it be that he is just <br/>\nnot &quot;anal&quot;?  Maybe he is just very laid back and lets things roll <br/>\nright off of his shoulders.  Maybe he sees the &quot;bigger picture&quot; in <br/>\nthings and doesn&#39;t get hung up on &quot;details&quot;.  We need both kinds of <br/>\npeople in the world.  I&#39;m a &quot;big picture&quot; person too, and I make a <br/>\npretty good ER nurse because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember how often my mother told me I was lazy because I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nconcerned with the same details that she was.  I was just interested <br/>\nin other things.  I&#39;m 36 now, and my house is clean, my kids are well <br/>\ncared for, and I manage to hold a decent job too...even when I <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;feel like&quot; going to work :o).  I&#39;m not anal about it because I <br/>\nhave other things I&#39;m more interested in paying attention to.  Its <br/>\njust a trade off, its not immoral.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was &quot;deschooling&quot; (or maybe it was just an age thing), he <br/>\nwent through about a year of retreating into his own games, music, <br/>\nmagazines, etc.  When he emerged, he suddenly got a job, and joined <br/>\nthe swim team knowing only one stroke...and with no knowledge of how <br/>\nto do a flip turn.  That takes quite a bit of courage for a 13 year <br/>\nold perfectionist.  He even had to attend practice with younger kids, <br/>\nbut he was ok with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...take a deep breath and think about all the *good* things his <br/>\npersonality traits could produce.  See him and just love him as he <br/>\nis.  And when you feel you have accomplished that, let *him* know how <br/>\nmuch you believe in him.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Am I just thick?","postDate":"1055218778","msgId":73414,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjM204cSszNDB2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjM3UjdpOGk5NUhGSjYwMDA2YmY2OUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73411,"nextInTopic":73418,"prevInTime":73413,"nextInTime":73415,"topicId":73371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... individuals ... that ... possible even ... things) This reminds me of a comment a friend made to  me once when I was explaining to her that writing is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-443927095\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; &lt;&lt;Unschooling is a fantastic oppertunity for self motivated <br/>\n </span></blockquote>individuals<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but with lazy and unmotivated people it is more difficult.

It is great for UNmotivated people! <br/>\n  It gives them time and freedom to explore what it is they DO like.  My <br/>\nfirst suggestion would be to help your son find other interesting people to <br/>\nhang out with if you are concerned about the troubled girl next door.  Here <br/>\nwe have skate parks, is there anything like that where you live?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess would be that your son has many more interests than what you are <br/>\naware of.  It sounds like he doesn&#39;t feel safe letting you in on what does <br/>\nmotivate him.  Especially if he is or is afraid of being punished.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next suggestion would be to read, read, read.  RUN out and buy a copy of <br/>\nThe Teenage Liberation Handbook.  You can find a discounted copy here...<br/>\n<br/>\nI can almost guarantee if you read it and offer it to your son as <br/>\nacceptable, he will fly!  If he feels comfort and support in pursuing his <br/>\nown interests with your support he won&#39;t be content to just lie around <br/>\nreading magazines all day everyday.  I&#39;ve never known a kid to honestly do <br/>\nthat.  I don&#39;t think anyone here has.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour fears are steeped in public school brainwashing.  I know that sounds <br/>\nharsh, but it is absolutely true.  He needs, more than anything, to know <br/>\nthat you support him and think he is worthy of becoming an amazing <br/>\nindividual.  I promise, whether you believe it or not, he has picked up on <br/>\nyour feelings and doubts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this the same kid who reads skater mags all day and dresses in black, <br/>\nbaggy clothes?  My 12 yr old is very into the skater/punk scene.  She <br/>\ndresses in black and wears spikey jewelry and belts most of the time.  She <br/>\nis a GREAT kid!  We were school-at-homers for quite some time.  Then we <br/>\nbecame really laid back but still used curriculum.  She wanted to go to <br/>\nschool and asked often.  I left it as an option and ran like hell to find <br/>\nsomething better than what we were doing.  I found unschooling.  I took a <br/>\ndeep breath and dove in head first.  I quit asking her to do school work, <br/>\nchores, and every other nonsense thing I had been doing.  I quit punishing.  <br/>\nI started to ask myself questions daily.  Would I want someone telling me <br/>\nhow to learn?  How to eat, speak, spend my free time?  If I was feeling <br/>\ndown, bored, directionless, would I want my Mom to tell me what a lazy bum I <br/>\nwas or how hard I was going to have it if I didn&#39;t make something of myself?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was clear to me then what my daughter needed.  I read here; still do!  I <br/>\nbought books, checked out books, bought tapes (buy Sandra&#39;s!) read websites <br/>\nand started a journal.  The change has been truly amazing.  We are still <br/>\ngrowing, still learning, still feeling down and bored sometimes.  What we <br/>\nhave now is freedom.  We have love and respect for each other.  We finally <br/>\nhave peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nI urge you to start with Sandra&#39;s site first.  Her site has the more <br/>\npersonal changes and life transforming information.  Then go to <br/>\nunschooling.com.  For me personally, I got more out of Sandra&#39;s site.  You <br/>\nmight be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, tell yourself everyday, every minute if you have to, that your son <br/>\nwill turn out to be more than you ever dreamed he could be.  Remember that <br/>\nschool never turned out a bright or successful person.  The success comes <br/>\nfrom the person himself.  From his desires and motivation.  All the pushing <br/>\nand punishing in the world won&#39;t make a successful person.  Nor a happy one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106031689,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Am I just thick?","postDate":"1055212008","msgId":73393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYmYwMWMzMmVmNyRjMDlhZGMwMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4YS4xYjI5ZjIxOS4yYzE2OTFlYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73392,"nextInTopic":73394,"prevInTime":73392,"nextInTime":73394,"topicId":73371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Londa - I ll give you my opinions on some of the things you said.
