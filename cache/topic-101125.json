They&#39;ve always had play time for toddlers <br/>\non a daily basis, all over town.  When some homeschooling families came <br/>\nto use that time for their entire families, they were sent away for <br/>\nhaving the older children mixed with the younger ones.  After some teary <br/>\ndiscussions, they now have open gym/open games 4 afternoons a week <br/>\n(during school hours) for all ages -- not specifically for the <br/>\nhomeschool community, but open to us.  We take advantage at least once a <br/>\nweek; so far it&#39;s worked out wonderfully.  Even when the PE teacher on <br/>\nthe other side of the nylon gym divider gets pissy for having to compete <br/>\nagainst playgroups all day [I *do* understand his pain] and gets out his <br/>\nPA to talk to his class, we just pack up and go to the game room where <br/>\nwe can play FREE air hockey and choose from over 100 boardgames and 4 <br/>\nvideo game systems!!  We are quick to get out of there before school <br/>\nlets out, so we don&#39;t have to fight the traffic of kids pouring into the <br/>\ncommunity center where they can stay until 6pm or the traffic of parents <br/>\ntrying to get their kids home. <br/>\n    Every Friday we have an activity: Bowling, Swimming 2x/mo, and Game <br/>\nDay.  On days when there is no public school (including all summer <br/>\nlong), siblings and friends often join us. My kids get to see &#39;schooled <br/>\nkids&#39; every Sunday at church; our Sunday School program is run by an <br/>\nunschooling mom so the atmospere is very relaxed &lt;g&gt; For the schoolkids <br/>\nit&#39;s a treat, for my kids it&#39;s not a huge *school-like* imposition into <br/>\ntheir week.  My good friend with schooled kids has decided NOT to let <br/>\nour kids socialize as her kids have a bad attitude about school after <br/>\nbeing with mine for extended periods.  SHE doesn&#39;t want to deal with it, <br/>\nso the kids don&#39;t see each other.  In reality, my kids had to struggle <br/>\nso much to understand the school mentality [Hayden&#39;s a boooooy, we can&#39;t <br/>\nplay with /him/]of these kids that they don&#39;t miss them very often. <br/>\n    Our school district offers the text books for home use.  Last year, <br/>\nI brought them home and let them take up space on our shelves for the <br/>\n&quot;just in case&quot; someone wanted to see them.  THIS year, I don&#39;t have room <br/>\non my shelves for books we don&#39;t love, so I didn&#39;t accept their books. <br/>\n    The public libraries are REALLY QUIET during the afternoons! We have <br/>\nthe librarians to ourselves &lt;bg&gt; not to mention the computers are always <br/>\navailable and we get to choose from a fully stocked video/dvd library!!  <br/>\nThe zoo is ours and so is the local children&#39;s science center.  <br/>\nHonestly, I like the reduced germ factor when we&#39;re there alone &lt;vbg&gt; <br/>\nnot to mention the noise factor.<br/>\n    We are beginning a Destination Imagination program [which I somehow <br/>\ngot snagged into coordinating] in our group.  We have enough kids for <br/>\ntwo complete teams, but some of the older kids want a different <br/>\nproject.  We may have to open the team to schooled kids or have our kids <br/>\njoin a &#39;school&#39; team in order to participate in their dream team.  As an <br/>\nunschooler, I love the improv aspect of this program and the whole <br/>\n&#39;think outside of the box&#39; mentality of the organization. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Do you have any contact with researchers to get any insight on how to <br/>\n&gt;best allow our children to become outstanding adults - as well as giving <br/>\n&gt;feedback on our experience, which, in turn, might change the tone of <br/>\n&gt;some press reports and perception by the general public?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ME.  I have regular, daily, almost momentary conversations with myself.  <br/>\nThe one who is on this path of journey and discovery about how to best <br/>\n*ALLOW* my children to become the adults they&#39;re meant to be.  Okay, I&#39;m <br/>\nsniggering about *allow* -- what that means to me is that I move MYSELF <br/>\nout of the way of my children&#39;s lives and let them have their own, allow <br/>\nthem to have issues that are completely different than mine.  MY schooly <br/>\nideas and MY fears and MY ideals have no room on their journey -- <br/>\nthey&#39;re MY issues to deal with, dealing with them as mine makes all our <br/>\nour journeys easier.  THEY give me regular feedback on how I&#39;m doing.  <br/>\nTHEY let me know immediatly what is working and what isn&#39;t.  THEY are <br/>\nnot afraid to tell me what they need or that they need something and <br/>\ncould I help them figure out what it is... The public perception that <br/>\nneeds the most work is the perception of children as minions, as <br/>\nmindless robots who have no voice worth hearning; that&#39;s the one I work <br/>\non daily. <br/>\nI have opportunities to contribute as diana, the home/unschooling mommy <br/>\nwho is also a real-live human being: I&#39;m part of the Dakota Comment <br/>\npanel for our local newspaper, every week my opinion appears with my <br/>\nheading: Diana Jenner, 36, Homeschooling mother;  I was just asked to be <br/>\npart of a panel for SD Public Broadcasting to discuss the recent article <br/>\nabout the high % of kids in daycare in SD -- I declined as I don&#39;t find <br/>\nthe relevance, but they are keeping my info in case there comes a <br/>\nhomeschool issue to discuss;  I speak at church, most recently a talk <br/>\nentitiled &quot;A UUnique Perspective on Homeschooling&quot; which included an <br/>\nhour long group discussion following the talk;  anyone who goes to <br/>\nwww.southdakotahomeschool.com can find my phone number and call me for <br/>\ninfo -- I&#39;ve been the first contact for many people exploring <br/>\nhomeschooling in SD and I&#39;m glad to be the first one to tell them to <br/>\nrelax and enjoy the ride.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would also be interested in more specific experiences, such as, did <br/>\n&gt;any of you allow their children to read by themselves?

I found them insipid and <br/>\nthe kids did too!  Just as I carried them for as long as it took for <br/>\nthem to walk (and my heart broke as they each did learn it, in spite of <br/>\nwhat others warned me about wearing my babies), I read to my children <br/>\nfor as long as it takes for them to read.  AND just as I continued to <br/>\ncarry those babies long after they were walking experts, I continue to <br/>\nread to my children.  At 6.5, Hannah decided she could read and, by <br/>\ngolly, she did!  Her brother is now near that age and has been &quot;a <br/>\nreader&quot; for over a year, her aptitude sparked his interest better than I <br/>\nEVER could have with any *learn to read* technique. Reading came easy to <br/>\nme as a kid, because I saw the value it had to MY life immediately.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve always always loved to read.

We (ie the<br/>\nCoburns) have no interest in any contact with the local school system<br/>\nresources.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe playing sport question depends on the State and the school district.<br/>\nThere are also home school leagues for some sports. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you have any contact with researchers to get any insight on how to <br/>\nbest allow our children to become outstanding adults - as well as giving <br/>\nfeedback on our experience, which, in turn, might change the tone of <br/>\nsome press reports and perception by the general public?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only research I have needed is the fine example of parents here, some<br/>\nwith over 20 years experience with grown children, and the experience of<br/>\nhearing about and meeting some of the kids themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not looking for some formula for Jayn to *become* an outstanding adult.<br/>\nShe already is a wonderful and interesting person.

She has been able to recognize certain special<br/>\nletters, like &quot;J&quot;, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, for a while as well as certain words that<br/>\nare signs or labels - Toys R Us, Ralphs, Barbie, X-box, Mattel, Coke (from<br/>\nbill boards) and Stop. She has understood for a couple of years that these<br/>\nmarks on paper and screen represent spoken words. In the last 6 months she<br/>\nhas spontaneously been deducing that certain words begin with certain<br/>\nletters - usually correctly. Sometimes she will hear a sound in the word and<br/>\nrelate it to another word. One thing that intrigues her is the way the names<br/>\nof letters have different letters in them, for example &quot;eff&quot; begins with an<br/>\n&quot;e&quot;. This sometimes leads her to assert that the word &quot;egg&quot; begins with &quot;f&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI read to Jayn when she asks me to. This will be at different times. We have<br/>\nno bedtime routine or set schedule during the day, so the amount of reading<br/>\nI do for her is irregular. Some days she seems to want me to read to her for<br/>\nhours, continually choosing different stories, other times we go for several<br/>\ndays without me reading any stories or books. However Jayn is still<br/>\nsurrounded by a print rich environment. She is also interested in<br/>\ncatalogues, magazines and computer games. She sees me and dh reading many<br/>\ndifferent sources every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is still in the process of writing her birthday thank you cards to all<br/>\nher friends. She draws a portrait of the giver, and then is writing &quot;Thank<br/>\nyou [name] Jayn&quot; inside, or &quot;Dear [name] Thanks Jayn&quot;. She often wants to<br/>\nwrite sentences and asks me to spell the words for her. I tell her the<br/>\nspelling, and then she will either write the letters from her memory or ask<br/>\nwhat they look like. I show her either with my fingers (which she also likes<br/>\nto do), or I find it written on the labels or book covers around us. As the<br/>\nlast resort, I write the letter on her magnadoodle for her to see it, if she<br/>\nhasn&#39;t recalled the shape from my description. She has been both writing and<br/>\ntyping (for computer games) her own name for many months.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is interested in the idea of different fonts. She notices when some<br/>\nletters are &quot;fancy&quot;. She is mostly writing in capitals, although will create<br/>\nsome fancy versions of her own name sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never &quot;taught&quot; her to read or write anything. All of her reading or<br/>\nwriting activities are of her own instigation, although I did suggest that<br/>\nshe should create the thank you cards. I had the expectation that I would be<br/>\ndoing the writing in them, so I got a delightful surprise when she wanted<br/>\nto! She is exactly where she is meant to be. Of all her friends who are<br/>\nclose to her age, one is an early reader, one shows no interest in doing any<br/>\nwriting or drawing whatsoever (according to her mom), and the others all<br/>\nseem to be doing about the same amount of writing that Jayn does. The<br/>\ndifference? Most of the others have mothers who are making them do reading<br/>\nand writing lessons.

The variety of homeschooling styles reflects the diversity of the <br/>\npeople who choose this method. Some families organize their homeschool the same <br/>\nas a traditional school, with the children studying the same subjects the same <br/>\nway as public school students. Some families use the opposite approach and <br/>\n&quot;un-school&quot; their children-a far less structured approach where the children’s <br/>\nschedule is determined by their interests and readiness. Most homeschoolers, <br/>\nhowever, use an eclectic approach that is partly structured and partly <br/>\ninterest-based. This method allows parents to pick and choose the classes and materials <br/>\nthat meet their children’s needs. These may be college or co-op classes, pool <br/>\nteaching, charter schools, independent study programs, apprenticeships, <br/>\nvolunteering, and a host of options. Homeschooling is as unique as you are.<br/>\nQ: What type of families homeschool their children?<br/>\nA: Although homeschoolers are often stereotyped as hippies or religious <br/>\nfanatics, most homeschoolers are just normal parents who have decided to take <br/>\ncharge of their children’s education.

Some homeschoolers have <br/>\nstrong religious beliefs and some are nonbelievers. Homeschoolers are just <br/>\nlike you.<br/>\nQ: Is homeschooling legal?<br/>\nA: Homeschooling is legal in all fifty states and throughout Canada. <br/>\nHomeschooling is also becoming increasingly popular in Australia, New Zealand, <br/>\nEngland, and Japan. However, every state and province has its own laws regarding <br/>\nhomeschooling and some are more &quot;friendly&quot; than others. Some homeschooling laws <br/>\nmerely require you to let your local school district know that you will be <br/>\nhomeschooling your children. Some laws require you to fill out paperwork as if you <br/>\nwere a private school. If you are considering homeschooling, you will need to <br/>\nget information on the current laws in your area. State or local homeschool <br/>\ngroups are often the best source of information. A member of a support group in <br/>\nyour state can advise you on how to register as a homeschooler in your state. <br/>\nIt is NOT necessary to join a Legal Defense Fund. We also recommend become <br/>\nfamiliar with your state&#39;s homeschool law at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a><br/>\nQ: How much does homeschooling cost?<br/>\nA: Depending on the choices you make, homeschooling can cost either a little <br/>\nor a lot. Generally, you can assume that homeschooling costs more than a <br/>\npublic school education and less than a private school. If you had to, you could <br/>\nhomeschool for free using public resources like libraries, PBS shows, museums, <br/>\nthe Internet, and hand-me-down educational supplies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, homeschooling costs more if you use a boxed curriculum or sign up <br/>\nwith an independent study program. For example, in 2001, a complete fifth <br/>\ngrade program costs $570 from Calvert School, $230 from Alpha Omega Publications, <br/>\nand $1,400 from Laurel Springs. Homeschooling costs are higher for teenagers <br/>\nthan for elementary school students, and fees are normally charged on a per <br/>\nunit basis. Since many homeschool teens also take college classes, you will have <br/>\nto factor that into your educational budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will also want to budget additional funding for extracurricular <br/>\nactivities such as soccer, gymnastics, martial arts, piano lessons, and the like. Since <br/>\nhomeschooled children have more time, they tend to participate in more of <br/>\nthese activities.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202109565,"authorName":"MoonStarWolf )O(","from":"&quot;MoonStarWolf &#92;)O&#92;(&quot; &lt;moonstarwolf333@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]Unschooling Vs Homeschooling was: Digest Number 5033","postDate":"1100710412","msgId":101160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmQwMWM0Y2NjNSRmOWMwMjdjMCRjMzI5OWYwNEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDFlOC4yZTM2ODk0Yi4yZWNjZGE3NkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101149,"nextInTopic":101182,"prevInTime":101159,"nextInTime":101161,"topicId":101125,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The HSLDA only works for those who they share their hard core beliefs. we have never considered turning our cash over to them.  big waste of time.
