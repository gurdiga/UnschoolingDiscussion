I&#39;d check <br/>\nwww.nyc.gov for that kind of information.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I need to know a few things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) What are your kids ages?<br/>\n2) Are you renting a car?<br/>\n<br/>\nNYC is probably on of the most car and kid unfriendly places in the <br/>\nworld --unless you know where to go. So, depending on the ages, I can <br/>\ngive you more information.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor general stuff, some rules of thumb:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Never rent a car EVER unless you want to go out of NYC. It is not <br/>\nonly incredibly expensive but, if you do get a deal you will be screwed <br/>\nwith what it costs to pay for parking ($14-20/hour at most lots in <br/>\nMidtown). Even downtown lots will cost you about $9 and hour. Unless <br/>\nyou want to spend 4-5 days looking for a parking space, good luck <br/>\ntrying to find one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. If you do not want to pay out the nose for lodging, stay away from <br/>\nmidtown Soho, Midtown and the Upper East and West sides (up to 95th <br/>\nStreets). That is about most of Manhattan. Harlem may have affordable <br/>\nbread and breakfasts. You certainly want to look into Brooklyn. At the <br/>\nlow end, expect to pay between $90 to $125 a night. You may find <br/>\nsomething for $75 a night in Brooklyn or even Harlem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would stay away from Staten Island, especially if you have small <br/>\nchildren and do not have a car. It is as suburban as you can go in the <br/>\nNYC area. There is not much to Staten Island unless you consider the <br/>\nFresh Kills Landfill a top sight-seeing place. Snug Harbor Cultural <br/>\nCenter does have some interesting things but it can be all done in <br/>\nabout 1 day (www.snug-harbor.com).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. If you are going to go whacked out traveling from one place to the <br/>\nnext, the best thing to do is to get an unlimited rides MetroCard. It <br/>\nis $16 and it lasts for a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in the East Village. It costs me $11.50 + tip to go to 86th & <br/>\nAmsterdam. On any given day you could easily spend $30-50 just on <br/>\ntaxis. You certainly want to focus on mass transit. At the NYC website <br/>\nyou can get maps to the train and bus systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Try not to eat in the Midtown area. Most places suck and are their <br/>\nprices are ridiculous. Stay especially away from the delis with buffets <br/>\n(big rip-offs). The place to look for decent food at affordable prices <br/>\nis down here in the Village. From East to West you can find places <br/>\nwhere you can spend anything from $5 to $50 per person. In midtown the <br/>\naverage is $20.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY has an exhibit about <br/>\nEinstein. I still have to go see it but I have been told it is good. <br/>\nI&#39;m going next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost museums in NYC are private like the AMNH but THE METROPOLITAN <br/>\nMUSEUM OF NEW YORK is actually publicly funded. Never, EVER pay the $10 <br/>\nsuggested entrance fee. That would be $40 for a family of four. No real <br/>\nNew Yorker ever does :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6. TKTS is a non-profit organization that &#39;harvests&#39; first class <br/>\ntickets to Broadway and Off-Broadway shows and sells them half-priced. <br/>\nBefore you get excited, please note that to see a show like OKLAHOMA! <br/>\n(which is fantastic and I highly recommend), it would cost you $100 for <br/>\norchestra tickets. So for a family of 4, instead of $400, we are <br/>\ntalking about $200. This is just the show --no food, no drinks, nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people make the like at Times Square. The other booth was at Tower <br/>\n#1. After 9/11 they moved just off South Street Seaport. If you take <br/>\nthe M15 bus it leaves you a half a block away. You have to go and buy <br/>\ntickets either for the 8pm show of that day or the 3pm (if there is any <br/>\nmatinee) of the next day. They only accept cash --no traveler&#39;s checks <br/>\nof any kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on your interests I can give you more specific information. <br/>\nIt would take at least a year to really see NYC. This is a small space <br/>\nmade huge with the diversity of activities you can find. Tell me what <br/>\nyou guys would like to do so I can help you better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: NYC","postDate":"1042676499","msgId":55273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMS41Y2M3OS4yYjU3NTUxM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55251,"nextInTopic":55346,"prevInTime":55272,"nextInTime":55274,"topicId":55030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/15/2003 7:14:04 PM Eastern Standard Time, mulwiler@hotmail.com writes: The day we were there, we had to choose between Oklahoma, Lion","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-490596693\">In a message dated 1/15/2003 7:14:04 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mulwiler@...\">mulwiler@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day we were there, we had to choose between Oklahoma, Lion King, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Les Mis, and a few others.
