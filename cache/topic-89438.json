Do you think a lemon tree branch would do?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, I do remember my friend and I staring intently at objects after<br/>\nreading about someone who claimed to be telekinetic.  We were sure it would<br/>\nwork if we tried hard enough.  I also remember trying to walk on the surface<br/>\nof the swimming pool like Jesus and Peter but this was more fantasy play<br/>\nthan actual religious thinking.  Must have been about 10years old at the<br/>\ntime.   Later we saw how they did it in the movies (clear plastic platform<br/>\njust under the surface of the water.  Cool.)  It&#39;s funny, that, even though<br/>\nI learned telekinesis is a sham, and actors in movies can&#39;t really walk on<br/>\nwater, my faith in Jesus (or Peter for that matter) didn&#39;t suffer as a<br/>\nresult.  I think kids are able to learn and process things in lots of<br/>\ndifferent ways.  When we try to put everything into &quot;real&quot; and &quot;not real&quot; we<br/>\nspoil some of the fun and sometimes rob them of the *real* magic that is<br/>\nfound in myths, allegories and fictional stories.
