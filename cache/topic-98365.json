I just can&#39;&#39;t afford it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to tell neighbor kids to go home to eat before, but I try <br/>\nto keep affordable snacks on hand. When they stop here after school <br/>\nand start snooping through my fridge, I say NO. That&#39;s what home is <br/>\nfor. But if we have company, I assume we feed them while they&#39;re <br/>\nhere.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a difference between kids that stop here every day and those <br/>\nwe invite. The invited ones I expect to feed, the stopoffs I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel responsible for...though I&#39;ll put out cheap snacks for them <br/>\nsometimes too. Depends on our finances at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nChips, lemon/limeade, small oranges or apples, cereal, nuts or <br/>\nchunks of cheese are the typical ok snacks. Lately our S&#39;mores maker <br/>\nhas been popular with the neighbor friends we have....they think <br/>\nit&#39;s heaven to get sick on marshmallows. Marshmallows are cheap, I <br/>\njust hope their parents don&#39;t catch on!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a fairly cheap trade off...a few extra groceries for my <br/>\nkids to have a fairly constant stream of friends through our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98363,"nextTopicId":5500}}
