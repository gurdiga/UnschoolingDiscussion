We&#39;ve tried watching for the animals but can&#39;t see them.... <br/>\ndid a google search and came out empty.  They&#39;re like rabbit <br/>\ndroppings but larger; we&#39;ve ruled out a porcupine I think, and I <br/>\nthink we&#39;d notice deer and they&#39;d much the plants besides.  We&#39;re in <br/>\na trailer park, not much wildlife here ... maybe skunks?  They&#39;ve <br/>\nnever pooped in the garden before but I put down llama manure this <br/>\nyear and cedar mulch in the paths, maybe one is drawing them?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thought IDing it would be fun to do with the kids then we <br/>\ncan clean up all the poop and solve the problem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94757,"nextTopicId":94631}}
