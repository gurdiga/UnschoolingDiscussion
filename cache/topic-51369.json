Babies look for the nipple instinctively and do know how to suckle, they don&#39;t need to learn!<br/>\nSeems to me that a lot of the times they are not given the chance to do it on their own, especially when they&#39;re born in hospitals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember watching a video on natural birth as I was getting ready to give birth myself, and you could see the newborn (just born) crawl from the mom&#39;s belly toward the nipple and then start suckling. It took some time and effort, but that baby had total determination, in a gentle, soft way. It was beautiful to see!<br/>\nThen I got to experience it myself when my daughter was born AT HOME.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere have you been told this? It&#39;s like saying than humans are less evolved than animals. Next the &quot;experts&quot; are gonna start saying that babies need to be taught how to breathe or something. Actually, didn&#39;t they think so in the 50&#39;s when they would slap the poor newborn on the bottom to &quot;make him breathe&quot;? Oh my God!!!!   ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBirth has become so artificial (of course, it&#39;s always BIG bucks for the medical institutions) that now they promote fear of natural birth and unnatural reactions left and right. Then they try to make people think that those baby reactions are all &quot;natural,&quot; they create &quot;statistics&quot; to prove their points and sell more crap and fear. It&#39;s such a well-rounded business.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a baby was &quot;out of it&quot; in an environment like a hospital, where he is separated from his mother to begin with and left with the feeling that he has no control whatsoever of his environment and no protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/12/02 9:32:29 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:liza@...\">liza@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; The fact that human babies have to learn how to suckle<br/>\n&gt; really tells us a lot about the human animal.  &gt;&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga and Therapeutic Massage.<br/>\nAsheville/Weaverville, NC<br/>\nwww.bluelotustherapeutics.com<br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of North Carolina<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\nWeaverville, NC<br/>\nwww.dyc-nc.org<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
