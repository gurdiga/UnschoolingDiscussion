Hot shot out-of-staters. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as we crossed the state line from OK into Arkansas we missed a<br/>\nspeed limit sign and got pulled over. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe patrolman&#39;s name was officer Crusader.  No kidding. He didn&#39;t ticket<br/>\nus. He just asked a lot of questions about where we were going and told<br/>\nus to slow down.  He was nice, but honestly, officer Crusader?!<br/>\n<br/>\nMontana has a speed limit again.  I mostly comply. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102469,"nextTopicId":103477}}
