I don&#39;t agree, I loved the movie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids (10 and 16, both boys) watch as much tv as they want, as <br/>\nmuch computer as they want, as much nintendo as they want.  <br/>\nHowever, as with anything, if you allow them unlimited access to it, <br/>\neventually they get REALLY tired of it and look for other things to <br/>\ndo.  It&#39;s better if they learn on their own that it&#39;s really boring to do it <br/>\nall the time.  That way, I am not constantly forcing them to do <br/>\nsomething else.  They choose on their own to do something else.  <br/>\nMy ten year old loves nintendo, but he also loves creative projects.  <br/>\nAll I have to do is sit down at the kitchen table and start a project, <br/>\nand he&#39;s right there wanting to help me.  He also loves to play <br/>\noutside in the summer.  Also, we talk about every program they <br/>\nwatch, so they get a lot of values teaching from everything they <br/>\nwatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t have a lot of restrictions on what they can do....as <br/>\nlong as they clean up their own mess, and don&#39;t disturb or hurt <br/>\nothers, they can do what they want, go to bed when they want, get <br/>\nup when they want, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and as a member of the household they have to do chores.  I <br/>\nguess that is a limit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20900,"nextTopicId":20911}}
