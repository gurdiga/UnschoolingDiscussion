One night I IM&#39;d her in tears as I <br/>\nhad just returned from a homeschool picnic and felt<br/>\ntotally not fitting the pattern of the homeschool parents that <br/>\nwere in attendance. I was also cornered, and yes, I also brought<br/>\nup unschooling.<br/>\nShe was a godsend.<br/>\nThe first thing I did when deciding to re-homeschool was to  rejoin this <br/>\ngroup. I needed<br/>\nthe support and felt like I was with people that understood<br/>\nmy decision, and how important my child&#39;s future was to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be honest and let you all know that I was in a very<br/>\nabusive marriage, there wasn&#39;t a day that I wasn&#39;t walking<br/>\non pins and needles, I was called every name in the book,<br/>\nI was spoken to with the words that have been mentioned<br/>\nin the posts. There were nights that I thought I wouldn&#39;t live<br/>\nthrough his rages, and times I literally had to fight for my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime has healed a lot of that, my hopes are that no one here<br/>\neven has had to go through any of it, ever. The words in print brought<br/>\na lot of it back for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a post to ridicule anyone, I don&#39;t want anything except<br/>\nfor you to hear me. I will give myself a few days to think about<br/>\nleaving this group.
