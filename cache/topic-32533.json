There were<br/>\nfour different companies publishing the<br/>\nSears-catalog-sized version last time I noticed,<br/>\npriced between ten and twenty dollars.  Using them and<br/>\nthe PBS GED programs (30 minutes each, a series on<br/>\neach major subject area) you can cover everything<br/>\nrequired on the tests.  PBS stations also made<br/>\navailable the set of GED workbooks for about $25, but<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t use those.  Local high schools and community<br/>\ncolleges -- many facilities that offers adult<br/>\neducation -- often provide pre-testing to check<br/>\nreadiness for the GED, as well as classes which help<br/>\nyou catch up on shaky areas.  You can take all or one<br/>\nor any of the subjects.  The high school in the town<br/>\nwe came from last year offered these free of charge<br/>\nfor anyone eighteen or older. My first daughter wanted<br/>\nher GED, to show on paper she had learned something,<br/>\nand of course it is easier to find work and enter<br/>\ncollege with a high school or equivalent certificate.<br/>\nThe GED book was very thorough, and she didn&#39;t have to<br/>\nspend much time with it.  She started working at age<br/>\n16, did a lot of reading and letter-writing, sewing,<br/>\nbrief classes and various community activities. I<br/>\ntaped the PBS programs for her while she was at work<br/>\nand she watched them when she had time. She pre-tested<br/>\nto feel confident she was ready and soon after her<br/>\n18th birthday took her GED test, passing with a pretty<br/>\ngood score the first time.  The test is in something<br/>\nlike five sections.  If you don&#39;t pass them all you<br/>\ncan retake the sections you need.  At that time, there<br/>\nwas no limit on how many times you could take each<br/>\nsection.  The community college she attended gave a<br/>\nscholarship for the higher GED scores.  <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
