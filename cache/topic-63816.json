Might help though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a last note, good for you for finding a support group of unschoolers. I<br/>\nhave yet to find one other family in my area that homeschool. Found out<br/>\nyesterday that there is a group of unschoolers in Miami. That&#39;s just way too<br/>\nfar for me. I&#39;m happy for you. I would love to find just one family locally.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140850796,"authorName":"elfmama_2","from":"&quot;elfmama_2&quot; &lt;elfmama@...&gt;","profile":"elfmama_2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"mother problems :-(","postDate":"1049924433","msgId":63816,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3MjQwaCttYmhiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":63817,"prevInTime":63815,"nextInTime":63817,"topicId":63816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sorry about this, but I m home alone with the kids, Jason is out helping my stepdad, and I just got a hour long reeming from my mom about how schools are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-653277587\">I&#39;m sorry about this, but I&#39;m home alone with the kids, Jason is out <br/>\nhelping my stepdad, and I just got a hour long reeming from my mom <br/>\nabout how schools are different then I remember and how I&#39;m damaging <br/>\nmy kids by keeping them from school and peer interaction and that <br/>\nJaiden obviously has aspeech problem and if I knew what was good for <br/>\nhim I&#39;d put him in school so he could get free speech therapy. I told <br/>\nher that we were commited to homeschooling (I haven&#39;t even tried to <br/>\nexplain unschooling to her) and that no we don&#39;t sit down and do <br/>\nschool every day. She told me that I was teaching my kids to be <br/>\nunable to function in the real world if I don&#39;t force them to eat <br/>\nwhen I say it&#39;s time and send them off to bed when I think it&#39;s time <br/>\nand all the other crap that I&#39;m sure you all have heard a million <br/>\ntimes from people in your life. I knew it would happen sooner or <br/>\nlater, I just thought it would happen when Jaiden and Avery were old <br/>\nenough to actually GO to school. I feel, hell I don&#39;t know how I <br/>\nfeel. I&#39;m angry and hurt and saddend by it all. I am a little scared <br/>\nof what she might do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry about all of this I just didn&#39;t know where eles to turn. <br/>\nThank you all for being here.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\np.s on a happier note, I just started a local unschooling group, it&#39;s <br/>\nstill in the early stages but as of yesterday(day 2 of the group) we <br/>\nwere up to 25 members, I&#39;m so excited to think that ther are <br/>\nunschoolers in my area!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the link in case anyone is interested. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/SanDiegoUnschoolers\">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/SanDiegoUnschoolers</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64235,"nextTopicId":63790}}
