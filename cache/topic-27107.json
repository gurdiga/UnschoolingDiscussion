I&#39;ll use a high profile case that most everyone<br/>\nheard about, Patty Hearst.  The media told you about a poor little rich girl<br/>\nwho was kidnapped and how the evil (notice that word again) SLA used her for<br/>\ntheir own ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the reality.  Patty hung around Berkeley and was a radical sh*t<br/>\ndisturber from the get go.  She was arrested on at least 3 occasions that I<br/>\npersonally know of for &quot;intent to insite a riot.&quot;  One of her more enfamous<br/>\nspeeches was about &quot;make yourself available&quot; blah, blah, blah &quot;so your<br/>\ncapitalist warmongering dog parents will have to buy your safety.&quot;  She<br/>\ncontinued on to outline the plan.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I went to school with Nancy Ling, later to add the last name Perry.<br/>\nNancy was quiet, comfortable, not rich, an Honor student, student body<br/>\nofficial, and very concerned about what was happening in our world.  We all<br/>\nuse to go down to Berkeley and hang around People&#39;s Park complaining and<br/>\nprotesting about what was going on.  By then the 3 classes that we knew the<br/>\nbest (ours, the before and the one after us) numbered about 700 kids and<br/>\nalready over 70 of the boys we went to school with had died.  We were not<br/>\nhappy campers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all knew Patty.  We all hung out together.  A favorite place was Jack<br/>\nLondon Square.  Patty continually talked about how to set up &quot;kidnapping&quot;<br/>\nand how to get the borgouise (o.k., so I can&#39;t spell &lt;g&gt;) dogs (meaning<br/>\nparents) to &quot;cough up their blood money.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was NOT kidnapped.  She was the &quot;brains&quot; of the plans to kidnap folks.<br/>\nThere were two or three others but they never made the news.  Maybe because<br/>\nher father owned the news???  Her arrest records have &quot;vanished.&quot;  Those of<br/>\nus who use to hang around the coffee shops were all contacted and threatened<br/>\nif we said boo about what really happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ONLY PEOPLE who they could positively ID as having been at the last<br/>\nplanning meeting were killed in a fire in LA!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the average citizen does not realise is that most of the violence that<br/>\nis attributed to radical protesters has usually been perpetrated by the<br/>\ngovernment.  If you look into any group the Feebs have taken on you will<br/>\nfind a gun fight and a fire!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is interesting to note that both the LA fire and the Waco fire have some<br/>\nreal close similarities, &quot;they fired on us&quot; and &quot;we only used tear gas<br/>\ncannisters.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe average citizen needs to know that the Feebs give seminars to local<br/>\npolice departments that supposedly are to show how to dismantle pipe bombs.<br/>\nThere was one held here at College of the Redwoods.  Shortly thereafter Judi<br/>\nBerry was injured and ultimately died from injuries received from a pipe<br/>\nbomb.  There was another seminar held shortly before a vehicle that belonged<br/>\nto AIM activists blew up from a pipe bomb.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe average citizen needs to know that the Feebs train groups and<br/>\nindividuals to infilitrate organizations and to do violent acts in the name<br/>\nof the organization they want to look bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Alcatraz for instance.  There was NO damage done to any building except<br/>\nfor some grafitti on the front of the building declaring it Indian land.<br/>\nALL the media and all the polls were in favor of the island being given back<br/>\nto the Indians as the law dictates (any abandoned federal land belongs be<br/>\nrights to any local tribe that applies for it).  The Feebs and government<br/>\nwere getting hundreds of calls and letters each day telling them to back off<br/>\nand follow the law and give back the land.  A group of 3 white men brought<br/>\nover a boat with food.  They supposedly were supporters of the effort.  Two<br/>\nnights later there were fires in the buildings and a major fire.  The next<br/>\nday the three men left and their names turned out to be phoney.  The press<br/>\nwere fed some inflamatory information saying the Indians had deliberately<br/>\nset fire to the building which was considered to be of historical<br/>\nsignificance (by who no one could ever figure out) as a way of thumbing<br/>\ntheir noses at the white community.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the protests in Seattle.  All you read about or saw on television was<br/>\nthe group that were breaking up windows and stealing things.  Those folks<br/>\nwere NOT part of the protestors.  They were a group that has Feeb ties that<br/>\nroutinely show up to cause violence so that the average citizen will<br/>\ncorrelate the protest with violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list goes on but I&#39;ll shut up now &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, who is sure she just heard a big sigh of relief &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Bridget E Coffman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 5:21 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Patriotism, media, protesting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Wendy,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have you met/talked to anyone who advocated violence in the name of<br/>\n&gt; protesting today?<br/>\n&gt; The only people I see harming innocent women and children are the Taliban<br/>\n&gt; and our government.<br/>\n&gt; Some of the time, you seem to think that protest is okay and other times<br/>\n&gt; you seem to associate ALL protesters with the minority of violent<br/>\n&gt; protesters in the 60&#39;s.
