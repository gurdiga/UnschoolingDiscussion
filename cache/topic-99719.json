We apologize.  The MAISD and local  districts were<br/>\n&gt; not aware of the scenario, and it was not shared  with<br/>\n&gt; students or parents who took part in the  exercise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; According to Dan Stout, Chief Deputy,  Emergency Services of<br/>\n&gt; Muskegon County, this scenario was  constructed in his office.<br/>\n&gt;  A sample scenario was required  in order to receive the<br/>\n&gt; necessary funding to stage the  event.  The Muskegon Area<br/>\n&gt; Intermediate School District and  our local schools did not<br/>\n&gt; construct the scenario, but  participated with other county<br/>\n&gt; agencies, hospitals, and  emergency responders in conducting<br/>\n&gt; the drill.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This exercise was meant to sharpen the skills  and response<br/>\n&gt; time of our emergency services personnel, but  was<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately clouded by the choice of this fictional  group.<br/>\n&gt; We believe this exercise had everything to do with  testing<br/>\n&gt; emergency response time and the protection of our  children.<br/>\n&gt; It had nothing to do with the home school  population.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As educators, we believe that the  first and most important<br/>\n&gt; teacher is the parent, whether in home  schools, public<br/>\n&gt; schools, or non-public schools.  We all  work together to<br/>\n&gt; ensure a safe and secure environment for our  children to live<br/>\n&gt; and grow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We sincerely regret offending home school educators.   We<br/>\n&gt; believe that all parents are educators and do important  work<br/>\n&gt; at home with their children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; # # #<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Please forward all  additional questions and comments to the<br/>\n&gt; Public Information  Coordinator at the Muskegon Area<br/>\n&gt; Intermediate School District at  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ktank@...\">ktank@...</a> or<br/>\n&gt; (231) 767-7263.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  **************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;  ************************<br/>\n&gt; Apology from Emergency Services of  Muskegon County<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Daniel Stout:  (231)  724-6341<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stoutda@...\">stoutda@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the world today Homeland security is very a  important<br/>\n&gt; issue.
