If Susan joined for emotional <br/>\nsupport for herself, rather than to examine how and why unschooling works, <br/>\nshe is needy of something this list can&#39;t provide.   And a desire for emotional <br/>\n(or technical) support for using a curriculum and pressing him to &quot;want to <br/>\nlearn&quot; is not something this list would do anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I see judgement, assumptions...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe   the policy of not allowing posts until a person has read for two <br/>\nweeks should be enforced more stringently.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I suspect that Susan has already concluded that sincere, supportive help <br/>\nis not to be found here-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she concludes that, she will be incorrect in that assumption.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Following the tone of<br/>\nthis discussion has shaken me, as I had been hoping to find a circle<br/>\nof encouragement, support and acceptance. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll find it here.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nA day and a half of reading, posting before waiting a week or two, and <br/>\njudging the list based on that is your option, but it&#39;s not the best option. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose who have written do live out their philosophy with their children, and <br/>\nthey were freely and generously sharing what they KNOW to be true--that <br/>\nfamilies can live peacefully, joyfully, and children can learn to read gently and <br/>\nsurely in their own time.    If that&#39;s not the answer Susan wanted to read, then <br/>\nshe came to the wrong place.   But I think she knew that, and it was clear in <br/>\nher first post that she didn&#39;t really intend to take our advice to heart, but <br/>\nto continue with Rod and Staff and her teaching methods.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is clearly, overtly, plainly not a Rod and Staff kind of list.   Rod and <br/>\nStaff is about control (the concept of the name of the curriculum, apart from <br/>\nany other details, some of which can be discovered here):<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.anabaptists.org/tracts.html#rastracts\">http://www.anabaptists.org/tracts.html#rastracts</a><br/>\nYou can do   your own google search.   There is no official site, but this <br/>\ncurriculum is by the people who have little free tracts you can pick up at some <br/>\nhomeschooling conferences (certainly not the Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>\nconference) that would just break your heart with their recommendations about the <br/>\ntreatment of children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t mean that the family in question uses those methods.   They <br/>\nmight not!   (I hope not.)<br/>\nBut this list is very clearly described at yahoogroups, and those who post <br/>\nbefore two weeks are taking their own chances AND disrupting the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut honestly, in this case even if the questioner decides she learned <br/>\nnothing, others on the list who were unclear about whether they might calmly wait <br/>\nthrough a child&#39;s &quot;late reading&quot; have probably been encouraged and enlightened, <br/>\nand those who were still at the point of figuring out what they believed have <br/>\nbeen able to see their ideas in light of those others that came by.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery unschooler has to figure out each aspect on her own.   Without <br/>\nunderstanding it and really choosing to practice it, that aspect will be cloudy and <br/>\nvague.    We can&#39;t sell the instructions, as Rod and Staff does.    <br/>\n<br/>\nControl won&#39;t work, with reading.   Reading cannot be controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a page on Disciplining Children at a site explaining Rod and Staff&#39;s <br/>\nphilosophy, right after the spanking paragraph (the five methods are Teaching, <br/>\nExample, Praise, Warning and Spanking), there is discussion of, when the kids <br/>\nget older, move toward withholding privileges instead of spanking.   Get this <br/>\nexample:   <br/>\n-=-<br/>\nWithholding privileges is more adult-like treatment. If one disobeys a proper <br/>\ndiet, the doctor will likely withhold pastries and sweets.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are people living with a set of life rules in which the idea that one&#39;s <br/>\ndoctor &quot;withholds pastries&quot; as an adult treatment.     <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.anabaptists.org/bh/258.html\">http://www.anabaptists.org/bh/258.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHow far can or should unschoolers go to meet that in the middle?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not trying to sell unschooling here. We&#39;re giving it away. We&#39;re <br/>\nhelping people build it new in their own minds, to help make it work in their own <br/>\nhomes. Those who don&#39;t want it don&#39;t need to stand and complain about it.   They <br/>\ncan go somewhere else where someone IS selling something, and buy that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] living out your philosophy","postDate":"1131549032","msgId":109423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDEwMWM1ZTUzZiRiYWFjOTRlMCQ2OTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrdDE1aytlNTg1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109419,"nextInTopic":109424,"prevInTime":109422,"nextInTime":109424,"topicId":109419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1831999326\">&lt;&lt;Following the tone of<br/>\nthis discussion has shaken me, as I had been hoping to find a circle<br/>\nof encouragement, support and acceptance.

(don&#39;t we all want to do better<br/>\nby our children?) We are here to discuss unschooling; what it is and what it<br/>\nisn&#39;t.  When people come here with an agenda already mapped out and aren&#39;t<br/>\nopen to changing then what is the purpose of the dialog?  The poster Momof7<br/>\nwas the first one to point out that she indeed was not an unschooler nor did<br/>\nshe want to be.  She also said<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I want my son to learn how to read. I&#39;m afraid that if I just stop <br/>\n&gt; &quot;teaching&quot; him, that when other people find out he can&#39;t read they <br/>\n&gt; will make a big deal about it. I&#39;m afraid that this will make him feel <br/>\n&gt; dumb and damage his self-esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which would lead me to believe it was more about her than him.  Because if<br/>\nit were only about how he felt, she would support him where he is at, not<br/>\npush him to do more than he is ready for.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be painful to have our subconscious agendas pointed out to us, but<br/>\ngrowth comes from self reflection.    <br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201771850,"authorName":"leavingemeraldcity","from":"&quot;leavingemeraldcity&quot; &lt;jtmartin@...&gt;","profile":"leavingemeraldcity","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"living out your philosophy","postDate":"1131546612","msgId":109419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrdDE1aytlNTg1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":109423,"prevInTime":109418,"nextInTime":109420,"topicId":109419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"But Kelly is right, she doesn t want to solve *her* problem.

I have read a lot about unschooling and am just<br/>\ntaking my first steps into it. My understanding is that it is a<br/>\nloving, accepting way of allowing one&#39;s children to blossom and flower<br/>\nin their own time according to the gifts that are in them. To not<br/>\njudge according to arbitrary standards, to seek to understand and<br/>\ngently nourish their initiatives. But I am not seeing this philosophy<br/>\nbeing lived out in the dialogue following Susan&#39;s questions. I see<br/>\njudgement, assumptions (the above quote is an example), even some<br/>\nunkind attacks. I suspect that Susan has already concluded that<br/>\nsincere, supportive help is not to be found here, as the consensus<br/>\nseems to be that she has not &quot;seen the light&quot; and members have taken<br/>\nto discussing her rather than responding to her.
