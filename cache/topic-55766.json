I <br/>\nwould say our parenting hasn&#39;t changed much lately, except for possibly the <br/>\nwords I use with the children. My husband Joe is still a bit more strict <br/>\nthan I would like but he&#39;s trying and listens to all my suggestions on what <br/>\nto do and not to do with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the question. Is there a general age when you have noticed that the <br/>\nchildren become more aware of others and start to not be so selfish?<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;m thinking of it more or the kids are more into <br/>\nthemselves lately, but they seem so into themselves recently they don&#39;t stop <br/>\nto think about others. I hear their words when there is a conflict, that <br/>\nthey talk it out and think of how the other would feel. What I don&#39;t see is <br/>\nthe action behind it on a daily basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as an example, this morning my 2 middle kids got up very early, (for <br/>\nthis house) it was obvious everyone else was asleep. They proceded to play <br/>\nin the playroom at a noise level that would wake the dead. I mentioned it <br/>\nonce and not 3 minutes later, it was just as loud as before. That&#39;s the kind <br/>\nof stuff I am thinking that maybe they would see by now. I&#39;m not looking for <br/>\na magical age, I know they are kids, but I just kind of worry now that maybe <br/>\nthey won&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55750,"nextTopicId":55760}}
