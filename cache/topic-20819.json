Most bulls<br/>\ncan&#39;t deliver naturally and are done by c-section.  Being a novice, I didn&#39;t<br/>\npay as much attention as I should have when we bought the bitch and then had<br/>\nher bred.  Our vet was not a bulldog specialist.  He gave her antibiotics<br/>\nafter the c-section as a routine thing, not as a necessary thing.  He did<br/>\nnot tell me about it.  All but one of the puppies died--the one that<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t nurse.  I had an autoposy done ($250 back in the dark ages) and<br/>\nthey had died of anaphalactic shock induced by penicillin which came through<br/>\nthe milk post surgery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have all the books on this where I can get to them.  However, years<br/>\nlater when I worked as Nursing Services Coordinator, I did coordination of<br/>\nECUs for nursing staff (they have to complete so many ECUs to keep their<br/>\nlicense current) and one of the videos and talks was on this very thing and<br/>\nwhat to watch for in the new baby nursery and the ICN (ours locally had<br/>\nmothers who wanted to nurse come in and nurse ICN babies if they (both)<br/>\ncould.  It is rare but not totally unheard of.  I suppose I could find it in<br/>\none of the nursing books.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:squeaksoup@...\">squeaksoup@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 09, 2001 6:25 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Milk does not always do a body good, was<br/>\nGeneralitie...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/8/01 19:32:54, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; It is a fact that SOME humans and<br/>\n&gt; other mammals bodies act as a sieve and the amount of antibiotic or other<br/>\n&gt; substance that goes into their body goes through and out in the breast<br/>\nmilk<br/>\n&gt; in the same concentration it goes in.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you have references for this?
