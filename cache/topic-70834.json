My husband supports our family very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comfortably. He never went farther than H.S. but he always tells the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; story of sleeping in class and the teacher telling him,&quot;he will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never amount to anything&quot; and some one pipes up and says<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;teacher..he already makes more money than you&quot;! He was airbrushing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; T-shirts in Daytona. He has gone on to be a very succesfull artist!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have friends (unschoolers, BTW!) who make a living with their art.  The <br/>\nfather was handicapped as a child (one leg is shorter than the other, tons of <br/>\noperations, etc.)  As a child and young adult he had to wear those ugly clunky <br/>\northopedic shoes and hated them.  This was in the 60&#39;s so he decided to design <br/>\nhis own cool/funky looking shoes...well, it turned into a business.  They now <br/>\ncompletely support their family with handmade, hand painted leather shoes.  <br/>\nHere&#39;s their website if you want to take a peek:  www.thoseshoes.com<br/>\n<br/>\nThey sell at a few big craft houses (Tamarack) and spend the summer going to <br/>\nshows and selling.  They have 2 very, VERY talented daughters (their artwork <br/>\nis unbelievable) who have been unschooling since they moved to WV about 6 or 7 <br/>\nyears ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70767,"nextTopicId":70835}}
