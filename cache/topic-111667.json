What<br/>\nworks, and doesn&#39;t work, for your families?**<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Carri Ann -<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an only child, James, who is 11.  While having fewer children in <br/>\nsome ways reduces the effort required by the parent, the lack of built <br/>\nin kids to play with in the home has a small opposite effect.  Parents <br/>\nof only kids may end up playing more Candyland and Monopoly than other <br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, finding kid and adult friends at parkdays (for him and for me) <br/>\nhas been very important.  (Unfortunately, in the community we moved to <br/>\nfor my husband&#39;s job, the only active homeschoolers I can find are <br/>\nsigned up for the school district&#39;s homeschooling program.  So we <br/>\ncommute to parkday.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur life is quieter than a lot of other unschoolers.  (Which can be <br/>\npleasant.  If I feel lonely, I can get on the computer.)  My kid enjoys <br/>\nbeing at home.  Until recently he was totally into World of Warcraft and <br/>\nwas playing that as much as six hours a day, on &quot;at home&quot; days.  (We <br/>\ndrive an hour each way to go to our favorite park day, and when we leave <br/>\nthe house, like today, we&#39;re gone for 7-10 hours, including dinner and <br/>\nextra-curricular hanging out.  So we have two kinds of days, and it&#39;s <br/>\nnot meaningful to &quot;average&quot; them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watch a lot of TV.  Mythbusters, stuff on Animal Planet and anything <br/>\nfunny are big at our house.  Last night we watched Terminator 2 and <br/>\ntalked about time paradoxes.  (I thought I spotted a plot hole!)  <br/>\nEarlier in the week we watched Sky High twice, because he saw a <br/>\ncommercial and asked me to rent it.  (Both from Netflix.)  Star Trek TNG <br/>\nand DS9 are on for about 3 hours on SciFi in the mornings, and sometimes <br/>\nhe watches a chunk of those.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you care, he goes to bed around 11pm and wakes up at 8:30 or 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is going on 12, but not all of his friends are that old.  <br/>\nPossibly because he&#39;s never been in school, he&#39;s still willing to spend <br/>\nhis time with them playing a lot of tag and hide and seek.  It&#39;s kind of <br/>\ncool that a kid who watches violent action movies can still be so innocent.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames likes to read, but for the last 4 years has read comic books (like <br/>\nGarfield and Foxtrot) almost exclusively.  (We have a lot of them!) Last <br/>\nnight he read Harry Potter after I was asleep, but that&#39;s rare.  I&#39;d say <br/>\nhe spends less than an hour a day reading.  Oh, I do read to him, when <br/>\nhe asks, and he picks what we read.  We&#39;ve read most of the HP books <br/>\ntogether multiple times.  The last book my husband read to him was <br/>\nSwimming to Antarctica.  I had picked this up at the library for my <br/>\nhusband, who&#39;s a swim coach, but my kid liked it a lot and asked for <br/>\nmore memoirs.  (I&#39;m thinking Farley Mowat.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI get concerned sometimes about the amount of so called &quot;screen time&quot; my <br/>\nson is getting, and find it hard to get him out and moving on the day we <br/>\ndon&#39;t go to the park.  I don&#39;t use threats, but I have stooped to <br/>\nnoodging.  (I don&#39;t recommend this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to get him to go cabin camping in the Santa Cruz mountains <br/>\nwith our state group next week, but he doesn&#39;t want to go without his <br/>\ndad.  I think he doubts my competence. &lt;g&gt;  (My husband is a school <br/>\nteacher so his schedule conflicts with a lot of great dates for <br/>\nhomeschooling events.  Darn it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy, in Benicia, CA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":11046692,"authorName":"sahm2cody","from":"&quot;sahm2cody&quot; &lt;CXFiles@...&gt;","profile":"sahm2cody","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Newbie question regarding unschooling only children","postDate":"1138681387","msgId":111667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRybW9uYitubnQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111673,"prevInTime":111666,"nextInTime":111668,"topicId":111667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"(this is cross-posted on other unschooling lists, so ignore it if you ve seen it before.

Thanks)<br/>\n<br/>\nHi ladies,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious about those of you who have only children. Although we&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen hs&#39;s for 4 years, we&#39;ve only been unschooling the last 4 - 5 <br/>\nmonths. I read a lot (on message boards, in hs/us magazines, etc.) <br/>\nabout familes with 2+ children. Their kids play together, do projects <br/>\ntogether, etc. I know that these parents also spend a lot of time <br/>\nwith their kids, but their kids also seem to spend a fair amount of <br/>\ntime doing things *together*. We don&#39;t have any kids nearby, nor <br/>\nunschoolers (we do know some VERY strict school-at-homers, but we <br/>\ndon&#39;t socialize with them much). There aren&#39;t any hs co-ops or <br/>\nplaygroups in the area, unless the kids are 5 and under. He does have <br/>\nsome public school friends that come over every weekend, plus several <br/>\nother weekly activities with kids, so he&#39;s not completely isolated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just wonding how other familes like ours work.
