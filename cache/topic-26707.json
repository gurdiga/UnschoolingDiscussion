The whole physics <br/>\nthing<br/>\nthrew me......then I watched Bill Nye and went Duh.  I understood physics<br/>\nvery well just didn&#39;t use the same words to describe things that the text<br/>\nbooks did.  As soon as I realized that, I realized that could be true of so<br/>\nmany things....that I or the kids understood the concept in the real world,<br/>\njust not the way that it is dissected in a &quot;curriculum&quot;.  Now I feel like<br/>\nthe world has opened up to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was like that in physics too.  I understand the concepts, just not the <br/>\nnotation (or I was so afraid of the notation early on that I blank out, and I <br/>\ncan&#39;t tell which).  But I&#39;ve seen homeschooled kids who were NOT made afraid <br/>\nof such things pick it up the same way they&#39;d pick up a Mario game--it&#39;s just <br/>\nanother game to them, another interesting bit of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed with grammar, too, that when a child is already using &#39;fancy&#39; <br/>\ntenses and forms, when/if the question comes up you can give a real-life <br/>\nexample of something they already do or know.  (And if the question never <br/>\ncomes up, so?  They&#39;re already using language in advanced native-speaker <br/>\nfashion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s also why I don&#39;t mind at all the idea of kids having books read to <br/>\nthem that wouldn&#39;t have been assigned to them until years later in school, or <br/>\nwatching movies with them with &quot;adult content.&quot;  (MacBeth, or Hamlet, or the <br/>\nparts of Othello they can stand are coming to mind.)  It doesn&#39;t matter what <br/>\norder things are learned in by an individual.  It only (vaguely) matters at <br/>\nschool, since kids are batch-taught in a system which wishes it used Ford&#39;s <br/>\nassembly line principles (so that an American third grader can change schools <br/>\nand not be behind or ahead, but that part has  never worked yet, not even <br/>\nwithin the same school oftimes).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo bits and parts of different things is all that individual learners <br/>\n(unschoolers and newly re-inspired parents thereof) to build a big model of <br/>\neverything.   I keep learning and reviewing things I know from  years back in <br/>\nlight of new information.   Yesterday a friend asked me about <br/>\n&quot;afghanistanism&quot; which is an old (hundred year old maybe) term.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow the meaning until he asked me to find it, and he could have used <br/>\ngoogle.com too, but I&#39;m glad he asked me because now I know something.  It&#39;s <br/>\na term used in and about politics and journalism to describe distracting <br/>\npeople from local problems by saying &quot;Oh, LOOK!&quot; at something foreign and <br/>\ninteresting.  The term has has a new life this month.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I wonder what was happening in Afghanistan in the Victorian or pre-WWI <br/>\ndays (IF that&#39;s when the term really originated).  But I don&#39;t have to find <br/>\nout this week.  It will be on my &quot;I wonder...&quot; checkllist and someday I&#39;ll <br/>\nfill it in some or I&#39;ll die first.
