I seriously underestimate how much<br/>\ntime it will take to get me ready. But, oh, yeah, I have to get Kat ready<br/>\ntoo.

What if every time you were in the middle<br/>\nof a great movie that you just couldn&#39;t stop watching your husband wanted<br/>\nyou to stop right now so you could accompany him to a sports bar to watch<br/>\n(some sport you detest) on the big screen for the next 3 hours for reasons<br/>\nthat weren&#39;t making much sense to you but you didn&#39;t have a choice. How<br/>\nquickly would you be getting ready each time he told you to get ready?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can ask them to get ready but you can&#39;t make them. Ask but assume you&#39;ll<br/>\nhave to do it for them. (And you&#39;ll be surprised and pleasantly thankful<br/>\nwhen they do get ready instead of being irritated when they don&#39;t :-) Tell<br/>\nthem it&#39;s important to you and thank them when they help out. Ask one of the<br/>\nolder ones to help a younger one? Talk to them about how to get out and work<br/>\nout a plan. Analyze the plan to see how it&#39;s working.

Here are some things which have <br/>\nmade my life easier when trying to get out the door..<br/>\n<br/>\nPlan ahead!  Have clothes ready the night before or a few hours <br/>\nbefore and put them in a central place.  My closet is big enough for <br/>\nus all to fit into so that&#39;s a good place in my house.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a go-bag for everyone.  I have little hooks by the garage <br/>\ndoor.  Everyone has a little bag to hang on it.  At least a couple <br/>\nof hours before we need to leave, I gather everything each person <br/>\nwill need and toss it in their bags. I also have a small dry-erase <br/>\nmagnetic board above the hooks and keep a list of what each person <br/>\nalways needs when we leave. (This would be good for listing such <br/>\nthings as glasses, inhalers, diaper bag supplies, small book or toy <br/>\nfor everyone, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had the shoe problem more times than I can count.  We tried <br/>\nthe shoe basket, then the shoe closet but everytime I was ready to <br/>\nwalk out the door, someone was missing a shoe.  The only solution <br/>\nthat worked for us was to put the shoes up high on a closet shelf <br/>\nand make that the last thing we do before we walk out the door.  I <br/>\nmake sure I schedule time to do it and as soon as we get home I put <br/>\nthe shoes back.  Our problem is the babies like to wear everyone&#39;s <br/>\nshoes and end up hiding them in places we never think to look just <br/>\nas we&#39;re heading out the door.  If the kids that can&#39;t reach them <br/>\nyet need them, they just ask and then I&#39;m alerted to remember to ask <br/>\nabout them later so I can put them away again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve actually left the house and noticed one of the girls didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave underwear on.  It took about three times of that happening and <br/>\nnow  do panty-checks on the little girls before we head out the <br/>\ndoor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think most of the problems are resolved with mom being prepared <br/>\nand organized. Of course, once the kids get older and you have <br/>\neveryone in the habit, it gets easier and they begin to naturally <br/>\npick up those tricks and use them for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118475879,"authorName":"Rebeca Zavaleta","from":"&quot;Rebeca Zavaleta&quot; &lt;rzavaleta@...&gt;","profile":"energmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"We can&#39;t get anywhere on time!","postDate":"1086677815","msgId":95421,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PCF+IVVFTkVSa1ZDTURrQUFRQUNBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUJnQUFBQUFBQUFBL2R6UWdCZTNjazZ1Tmdtbm40WFV1TUtBQUFBUUFBQUE4eWV3V3hhbmwwbS9LenVscU1jaEx3RUFBQUFBQHNvY2FsLnJyLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwODY2NzI5NjEuNDk5Ny4xNzE4MC5tMjVAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":95439,"prevInTime":95420,"nextInTime":95422,"topicId":95421,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"First off, I m new to the list and to unschooling (less than a year).

I&#39;ve also loosened up with our<br/>\n&#39;house rules&#39; and found that my kids (3, 7, and 10 yrs) are reasonable,<br/>\nresponsible, and willing to help me most times (when I ask -- and sometimes<br/>\nwhen I don&#39;t). Especially the 3 yr old.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we just can&#39;t all seem to get out of the house together in a timely<br/>\nmanner.  And some things have to be done by a certain time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always give the kids a heads up if something is planned, and remind them<br/>\na half hour before the time to leave. (bathroom breaks, shoes on, get stuff<br/>\ntogether if they need to bring something).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the very last second someone who seemed ready gets to our car but has<br/>\nforgotten shoes, or important toy, prescription glasses,(even underwear)...<br/>\nAnd then makes us all late, because they honestly cannot find the important<br/>\nitem they had a moment ago.  (We even have a basket near the front door<br/>\nwhere we place items to take and the shoes are in the front closet<br/>\n(ideally)).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a pretty patient person, but I find myself getting uptight.  And what&#39;s<br/>\nworse -- I&#39;ve lost my sunglasses quite a few times lately, too! (but not<br/>\nunderwear!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve relaxed our schedule, but we&#39;re scattered (only with leaving the house<br/>\n-- the rest of the time the kids and I are organized).  These are not<br/>\nusually forced outings (except grocery shopping or the like), even so, the<br/>\nkids enjoy even the usual outings.  Once we&#39;ve actually LEFT the house,<br/>\nthey&#39;re fine -- it&#39;s the leaving that seems hard for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this typical? <br/>\nWe have outings that we&#39;ve planned for the summer and I&#39;m dreading the<br/>\ngetting out of the house routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebeca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95410,"nextTopicId":95580}}
