(Bowling for  <br/>\nSoup...REALLY fun!)  I learned a bunch of things. <br/>\n <br/>\nFirst, I&#39;d assumed that when you bought a ticket to a concert in a club, it  <br/>\nmeant they gave you a seat. Apparently you just get a square of space on a <br/>\nfloor  where you can jump up and down. Luckily, there were not terribly in demand <br/>\nseats  at the side, so I was quite comfortable.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn the way home, we were taking the subway back to the car. There was a  <br/>\ngroup of girls who had also been at the concert, about Julian&#39;s age, maybe a  <br/>\nlittle older. I suddenly realized that I was looking at them in a brand new  <br/>\nway...  Each of these girls could be someone Julian loves someday. Yeah, I  know, <br/>\nprobably not these particular girls, but...  Seeing Julian as this  potential <br/>\npartner or dad, and these girls as something more than a bunch of  teenagers on <br/>\nthe train...  wow!<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s getting OLD!  Or maybe I am....<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105646,"nextTopicId":105743}}
