I&#39;m heading out on the road tomorrow, and was fiddling<br/>\naround with list settings before I leave, and thought I&#39;d check the digest<br/>\nfor this list, just to see how things are going... Didn&#39;t plan on posting<br/>\nanything, as life is, as Lisa puts it, very busy and hectic...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here I am. Lynda&#39;s note reminded me that this list is a reflection of<br/>\nthe people who use it, and if some of us don&#39;t take the time to make our<br/>\nvoices heard, er, writings read, then people just might be left wondering<br/>\nwho&#39;s minding the store, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a long-long term unschooler. Five totally unschooled kids, now ages 14<br/>\nthrough 26. Three grandkids, with a fourth due literally any minute now.<br/>\nMost of you probably know that, as I&#39;m not exacly low-profile online, but I<br/>\nthought I&#39;d toss it out there for the newbies on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat effect our unschooling kids are having out there in the world. Good<br/>\nconversation starter, Lisa. &lt;g&gt; Mine seem to be having a pretty good<br/>\neffect. Jody (20) called this last weekend and told us about going to visit<br/>\nsome UW college kids with a friend of hers. The Superbowl was on TV, and<br/>\nsome of the guys were watching it... she said a commercial came on showing<br/>\nsomething about overcrowded schools, and posed the question &quot;What can be<br/>\ndone about the problem...?&quot; To which Jody shouted &quot;Homeschool!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a typical Jody response, but she said the reaction from the college<br/>\nkids was dropmouthed amazement - they started asking questions -<br/>\nintelligent questions, according to her - and she said most of those who<br/>\nstarted out against the idea seemed to decide that maybe homeschooling<br/>\nwasn&#39;t what they thought. Jody said interestingly enough, no social life<br/>\nwas the primary argument from the girls, and no documentation was the<br/>\nbiggest question from the guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5980,"nextTopicId":6054}}
