Guess we&#39;re not alone, sounds like a lot of the USA is having a heat wave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined the kids today in the wading pool and eating a lemonade popsicle.  It was very nice :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just came back from an evening bike ride, now that it&#39;s finally cool enough to exert some physical effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just finished reading Never Too Late by John Holt.  It has motivated me to make time for some of the things I&#39;ve been trying to do, but haven&#39;t been spending enough time at.  I will be spending less time here for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuge thanks to everyone who has replied to my sometimes ignorant comments.  I *think* I&#39;m finally understanding unschooling, but still have lots of personal issues to work on so that I can help my kids grow up with fewer hang-ups.  I will always be grateful for the ways this list has opened my eyes, mind, and heart to so many issues regarding living with children.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope everyone is having a great summer!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76723,"nextTopicId":76828}}
