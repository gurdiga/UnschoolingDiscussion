Just means babies don&#39;t thrill me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly.<br/>\nMy dh does not care for the baby stage. That doesn&#39;t mean he does not ADORE his own children from the moment he laid eyes on them, it means he enjoys other stages better. It&#39;s not a crime to enjoy certain stages more than others. And it doesn&#39;t lessen the love you feel for your own children in any way.<br/>\nI happen to adore toddlers. Chubby, cute, silly-talking, busy toddlers. Especially that really kissable place right underneath their chin. Mmmmmm....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the slug comment? OH PLEASE! Slug means SLOW MOVING...as in Sluggish. My dh often says &quot;I feel like such a slug today&quot; when he&#39;s feeling slow and tired. It was a total JOKE. If you found it in poor taste, then I venture to say that there is a lot of humor that you might want to ignore.  I happen to know Kelly respects her children deeply and intensely and is not disrespectful to anyone elses children either. My very busy babsy boy felt very comfortable and loved at the conference last year, he&#39;ll be there again this year. <br/>\nWe stayed with the Lovejoys for a couple of nights and felt completely at ease, welcomed and all filled up with joy when we left.<br/>\nBabies ARE slugs...not in a bad way, it wasn&#39;t meant as a put down. Sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78146,"nextTopicId":78152}}
