When I first joined this list, <br/>\nSandra talked about gradually saying yes more often rather than saying <br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ve removed all limits.&quot; She also talked about spending more time <br/>\nwith my kids and focusing on their interests rather than focusing on <br/>\nmine for them. I do this with writing and language arts. I help moms to <br/>\nshift their focus from teaching a subject to knowing their children and <br/>\nseizing opportunities to encourage them in their writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took to unschooling partly because this is how I teach writing. I <br/>\nhelp mothers to become more in tune with who their kids are. We don&#39;t <br/>\nstart with the assumption that kids need to be &quot;taught&quot; writing but <br/>\nrather that our kids are interesting people whose thoughts deserve to <br/>\nbe recorded and shared (whether by them or for them by the mom).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when helping a homeschooling mom, to me the first step is to help <br/>\nher become aware of her children. Instead of seeing them as willful or <br/>\nas uncooperative or people to be taught, help her to see the ways that <br/>\nher children are already bright, interesting, reasonable people. Help <br/>\nher to see how she can nurture them, even if she is still holding onto <br/>\nthe security of following a program.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we help moms head in that direction (in the direction of seeing <br/>\ntheir children as delightful people who love to learn), they will more <br/>\nlikely keep travelling down that road (and using jj&#39;s analogy, they <br/>\nwon&#39;t be content to stop at the horsefarms and highway, but will get to <br/>\nDisneyWorld eventually). I&#39;ve had more moms share that the best thing <br/>\nabout changing how they see writing is that they have improved their <br/>\ncommunication with their kids and know them better. Isn&#39;t that the way <br/>\nto begin? We don&#39;t want moms to have to focus on whether their kids are <br/>\nlearning x, y or z (through unschooling or homeschooling), but on what <br/>\nneat people they get to live with and grow with. Then the learning has <br/>\na chance to be transformed and will fall into place.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrave Writer Online Writing Services<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bravewriter.com\">http://www.bravewriter.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVisit our user forums:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bravewriter.com/cgi-bin/dcforum/dcboard.cgi\">http://www.bravewriter.com/cgi-bin/dcforum/dcboard.cgi</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94993,"nextTopicId":94967}}
