My biggest piece of advise would be to just stop and enjoy.  Don&#39;t feel that you have to have alot of activities scheduled.  Usually children that age like to take it slow and explore.  Like when they go on walks and have to stop every two steps to examine something interesting on the ground...stop with him and look too.  When he asks &quot;why&quot; (a toddlers favorite question) and you don&#39;t know research the answer together.  It will do him good to see that adults don&#39;t know everything and also where to look for answers.  He will open up your world and make you wonder again, if you allow it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!
