I chose not to because I<br/>\nused to do evaluations for a living.  The information isn&#39;t going to tell<br/>\nyou anything you don&#39;t know....he&#39;s a nervous kind of kid who doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nseparation.  All the evaluation does is to compare him to a large group of<br/>\nkids and see where he falls along the bell curve.  You probably know pretty<br/>\nmuch exactly where he would fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, after you get the label, you will be pushed to medicate or at the very<br/>\nleast get counseling.  If you feel he needs either, go ahead.  If not, don&#39;t<br/>\nbother.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48733,"nextTopicId":48761}}
