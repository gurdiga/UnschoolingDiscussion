Well, according to the test, I do have ADD. And,<br/>\nwhile I believe that my son exhibits very many of the<br/>\ncharacteristics, I don&#39;t feel it necessary to have him<br/>\ntested, because I don&#39;t necessarily see it as an<br/>\nimpediment. And I definitely don&#39;t see it as an excuse<br/>\nfor bad behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever -- and this is a big however -- it was<br/>\nenlightening for me to learn about some of the traits<br/>\ncommon to ADD that have had an impact in my life. And<br/>\nawareness has helped me help my son learn to minimize<br/>\n(I definitely agree with Sandra that minimize is the<br/>\nright word here) the impact that a given trait (or<br/>\nlimitation -- call it what you will) has on him and<br/>\nhis life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that we (society) are making a huge mistake by<br/>\nletting children use ADD as a &quot;get out of jail free&quot;<br/>\ncard as an excuse for bad behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion -- and I certainly am no expert except<br/>\nin my knowledge of myself and my children -- having<br/>\nADD just means you may process information and<br/>\nsituations differently than some other people. But<br/>\nthen, introverts process information differently than<br/>\nextroverts. That doesn&#39;t make introversion or<br/>\nextroversion a handicap.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping our children understand themselves, how they<br/>\nview and interact with the world, and how to maximize<br/>\ntheir talents and minimize, or work around, their<br/>\nlimitations IS one of our responsibilities as parents.<br/>\nIn my mind, this is the same as &quot;finding more creative<br/>\nways to live with it&quot;, as Nancy stated. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, that&#39;s not unique to parents with children<br/>\nwho have been diagnosed with ADD. Everyone has<br/>\nstrengths and limitations. Some limitations will<br/>\nalways be part of us, and although we may develop ways<br/>\nto cope with them, some talents or abilities will<br/>\nnever be natural or easy to us. To me, that&#39;s the<br/>\nbeautiful thing about unschooling. My son could not<br/>\ncope with a &quot;learning&quot; situation in which he had to<br/>\nsit at a desk facing forward for several hours a day<br/>\nand pay perfect attention to a person at the front of<br/>\nthe room imparting information. <br/>\n<br/>\nInteraction with other people is just too important to<br/>\nhim. That&#39;s how he learns best, by bouncing ideas off<br/>\nof someone else, by sharing (verbally) what he&#39;s<br/>\nlearning, by discussing things he finds interesting.<br/>\nSo by choosing unschooling, I believe I am helping him<br/>\ncapitalize on his strengths and minimize the impact of<br/>\nhis limitations.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I&#39;m wrong, it&#39;s not my fault, because I have<br/>\nADD.

She said, and I quote exactly: &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>\nblame me, I have ADD and that means I&#39;m special needs and I can&#39;t help what I <br/>\ndo.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTHERE IT IS.<br/>\n<br/>\nMakes me shudder.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the hell is wrong with teachers and parents and school?  (Oh, never <br/>\nmind.  Ignore that question entirely.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIF one of my kids has a personality or mental quirk which could make it hard <br/>\nfor him to interact with other people (hey wait--it&#39;s not &quot;if,&quot; as they do <br/>\nhave a few little things) then I see my duty to help them find ways to <br/>\nminimize their problems, to interact without that being detrimental.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would never EVER tell my kids &quot;Well, just ignore people who think you&#39;re <br/>\nrude.  They don&#39;t know your excellent biological or psychological reasons for <br/>\nbeing rude.  They don&#39;t have your disabilities.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s easy for one child to be courteous and safe in play situations and <br/>\nmore difficult for another child to do the same, then there it is.  It&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to be more difficult for that one, but it&#39;s STILL expected and required <br/>\nto be courteous and safe when playing with other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents are worried that their kids might not have enough math skills or <br/>\nreport-writing experience to get jobs, and they might do better to see if <br/>\nthey have enough social skill to pass an interview and be respected by <br/>\nco-workers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27494,"nextTopicId":37791}}
