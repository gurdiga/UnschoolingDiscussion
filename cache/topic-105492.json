I thought those of you with younger children <br/>\nmight especially appreciate it:<br/>\n<br/>\nI Just Don’t Want to Mess Up My Child!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big secret to being happy with yourself, as a parent, is to focus <br/>\non the little moments. Don&#39;t be constantly worrying about the future, <br/>\nbut REALLY enjoy each age and stage and respect and honor the child as <br/>\nhe is right now. Easy to say, but this is so much harder for most of us <br/>\nthan it sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet your child teach you how to parent her. Think of yourself as a <br/>\nlearner. Your child knows perfectly well how to be exactly what she is <br/>\nright now; you’re the one who needs to intellectualize because you are <br/>\ncarrying around all kinds of baggage. Many of your reflexive responses <br/>\nto her are likely to be bound up in unexamined societal expectations <br/>\nand in duplication of or reaction to how you were, yourself, parented.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, work on being reflective instead of reflexive; put yourself in your <br/>\nchild’s place as much as you can. Practice seeing the world from his <br/>\npoint of view and you&#39;ll realize that he wants to grow up capable and <br/>\ncompetent and successful in his own way and that he wants to have good <br/>\nrelationships and to feel good about himself. And, you’ll know just how <br/>\nmuch he wants you to support and encourage and help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, what your child really needs is for you to recognize and <br/>\ncelebrate the shining beautiful spirit within her because how her <br/>\nparents see her, when she is a child, is very possibly how she&#39;ll see <br/>\nherself for the rest of her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest is just details!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam sorooshian</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105482,"nextTopicId":105493}}
