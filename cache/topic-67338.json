Was excited when<br/>\n  the<br/>\n  movie came out even though I knew it would be much less than the book.<br/>\n  The<br/>\n  movie was terrible. Maybe I&#39;d have liked it better (though I don&#39;t think<br/>\n  so)<br/>\n  had I not read the book. I wasn&#39;t expecting it to match up, but it was<br/>\n  ****way**** worse than not matching up.    Lara............. ****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, bummer.  I read the book a few weeks ago and just rented the movie<br/>\n  to watch tomorrow night.  Oh well, I&#39;ll watch it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I thought the new movie Holes was pretty true to the book, and the kids<br/>\n  and I enjoyed both.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kate<br/>\n  who loved White Oleander the book<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
