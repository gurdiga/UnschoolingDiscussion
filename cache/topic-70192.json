It started off with Joseph watching the last part of Men of Honor. He really liked it and we had a nice discussion afterwards. Alyssa was playing with old Cherry Merry Muffin toys and Sierra was playing a game with my mom. Joseph&#39;s attention was then drawn to asking questions about the Seminole Indians here and why they are allowed to have gambling and no one else here can. (my mom returned the other night with some considerable winnings) It all ended with me explaining a jock strap. Thanks to Sponge Bob Squarepants!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we all ended up in the playroom to play a new game Joseph made up. He&#39;s always making games and sometimes they are pretty cool and sometimes just more interesting to him and Sierra than anyone else. Well this game was really neat and we all enjoyed playing it. He had set up foam blocks and people and it was a strategy game trying to corner your opponent in and keep him from making anymore moves. It was funny because it reminded me of a favorite game of mine called Quandary. I was explaining it to Joseph and my husband and my husband got lost and Joseph was getting more excited about making our own Quandary game as he understood what I was saying. Joe (dh) stated that Joseph was definitely my child as he had no idea what were talking about!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we were all so excited and enjoyed the game so much we are now trying to figure out how to make it available to others and how we can improve on it. Thinking maybe selling it to the homeschool group or on the internet. I know toy companies are not looking for more board games. Does anyone know off hand how we can go about this so there aren&#39;t any problems? I&#39;ve been doing some searching tonight but not coming up with anything on a small scale. We&#39;re not looking to market it to Mattel. I just really want to find out if there would be a problem if someone else has a similar game. I can&#39;t look by names because I would have no idea just by name what the game is like. Wondering if I would need to get a patent or anything? Just thought someone here might know.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70097,"nextTopicId":70234}}
