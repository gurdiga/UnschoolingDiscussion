Oh wait, maybe that&#39;s flash<br/>\nbacks.)&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Mary,<br/>\n Puddles came about because we had acquired a new puppy (Jenni.. golden<br/>\nretriever) and she left little puddles all over the place :(. Also, after<br/>\ngiving birth to a 10+ lb baby, I can create a few &#39;puddles&#39; myself when I<br/>\nsneeze ( I can&#39;t stand allergy season!). So the kidlets were making fun<br/>\nabout the problem the puppy and I share and the name just evolved. My &#39;real&#39;<br/>\nnickname is Queenie and it came about because some friends, realizing I<br/>\nneeded a boost, delegated me to that imaginary status. Being an imaginary<br/>\nposition, I also acquired imaginary &#39;power&#39; worth about the size of this<br/>\ndot--&gt; . It&#39;s been amazing to see how some people see the name and assume I<br/>\nhave a superiority complex %-/ when, in fact, it is quite the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Carothers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: The &quot;Hs&quot; have it","postDate":"1016901883","msgId":33550,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxM1lsdUxDVGFvZ3hMRHA3bXYwMDAwMTFmYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33438,"nextInTopic":33598,"prevInTime":33549,"nextInTime":33551,"topicId":32828,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes one needs road signs but most of the time one<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really hard to describe how we unschool or define it without a whole<br/>\nhistory.  I never paid too much attention to rules or gender specific roles<br/>\nbecause we never really had any in our family.  My grandfather taught all us<br/>\ngirls how to hammer a nail and use a saw.  My dad had no problem with<br/>\nteaching us how to rebuild a Harley or letting us help rebuild the engines<br/>\nin cars or learning how to do body work.  I learned to box when I was 10<br/>\n(that was in the 50s and unheard of) because one of my uncle&#39;s best friends<br/>\nwas a professional boxer and when I asked about it they showed me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it was the area I grew up in or maybe I just lucked out by being born<br/>\ninto several generations of liberated folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always been totally &quot;kicked back&quot; and a rebel, so what has become known<br/>\nas unschooling came easy, we just didn&#39;t know it had a name for the longest<br/>\ntime &lt;g&gt;  I think the family motto is &quot;Hey, KEWL&quot; and then we explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is a typical day for us.  Youngest kidlet (9) got up at about 8.  She<br/>\ndid exercises (she wants to take gymnastics but decided she wanted to be in<br/>\nshape first) which included the weight machine, free weights and floor<br/>\nexercises and stretches.  Then she made herself breakfast and played on the<br/>\ncomputer for awhile.  Then she headed outside with Tuff E (new puppy).  They<br/>\nfed the rabbit and played chase.  She came in about 12:30 and fixed lunch<br/>\nfor herself and Tuff E.  Right now she just finished watching a video (Why<br/>\nCoyote Has The Best Eyes) and is now watching cartoons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys rolled out of bed about 1.  Eldest son pulled out a writer&#39;s<br/>\nhandbook and spent about an hour reviewing writing practices.  He&#39;s decided<br/>\nthat his writing isn&#39;t up to par for college and he is headed off to college<br/>\nin the fall.  He then went out and hit the punching bag for a while, then<br/>\nplayed with the puppy, took a shower and called a couple of friends.  They<br/>\nall took off for parts unknown.  About an hour ago they stopped back with a<br/>\nmovie that they thought hubby and I would enjoy watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle kidlet futzed on the computer for a while and the curled up in the<br/>\nsun with a book while grumbling that he wished the woman that wrote the<br/>\nHarry Potter books would get her arse in gear and get the next one<br/>\npublished.  Later he went out and practiced punting a football.  He hasn&#39;t<br/>\ndecided if he will try out for the high school team next year or the Pop<br/>\nWarner team or if he will just make a video when he is older and send it to<br/>\nNFL scouts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHubby transplanted a tree for me earlier, then went shopping and is now<br/>\nwatching Rosie or Oprah.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked on a deposition for a ADA case against the state this morning and<br/>\nnow I&#39;m up here in my VIP space pounding away at this machine &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday was completely different and tomorrow will be too.  Although, I<br/>\nhave been informed (3 different times, by 3 different people, in 3 different<br/>\nways &lt;g&gt;) that it is time to get busy in the garden so I guess that means we<br/>\nwill probably all be out in the garden tomorrow.  Which reminds me, I was<br/>\nsuppose to be looking for blue flowers that smell good on the net.  Anyone<br/>\nknow of any that are blue AND smell good?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do I define it?  I don&#39;t.  Definitions are too constraining.

Both my grandfather and<br/>\ngreat-grandfather would have been right at home with unschooling.  If my<br/>\ngrandfather or any of his 18 brothers and sisters wanted to learn about<br/>\nsomething, their father (this was in the 1800s) would order up whatever was<br/>\nneeded (including shipping tutors in).  There was no &quot;I am a landowner and<br/>\nfarmer, you will be too&quot; or &quot;you are a girl you will learn to clean and<br/>\ncook.&quot;  My grandfather was the same with my mother and my aunts and uncles.<br/>\nIn fact, he risks federal prison and withdrew them all from school!<br/>\n<br/>\nHerb.  My dad would have been right at home with unschooling.  Even though<br/>\nmy sister and I went to ps it wasn&#39;t required that we fit the mold and<br/>\nwherever our interests led that is where we were encouraged to go.  I was<br/>\nworking on motorcycles when I was 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather.  She was my first experience with what is now called unschooling.<br/>\nShe was the influence that led me to &quot;unschool&quot; my nieces and nephews back<br/>\nwhen homeschooling was underground.  I still stop and think &quot;what would<br/>\nHeather do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolt.  He gave it a name and the foundation from which the world of<br/>\nunschooling has grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen.  She is why I joined this list and while there are many others that I<br/>\nrespect (Mary, Mary, Linda, and the list goes on), her words are the ones<br/>\nthat always seem so rational in what sometimes seems like a war of words or<br/>\neven a deliberate misunderstanding simply because one party may not like the<br/>\noriginal poster, not their words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd worth reading again in my wanderings with the letter &quot;H&quot; -- Lynda<br/>\n==========<br/>\n<br/>\nDefining Unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nby Helen Hegener<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past few months there has been a lot of discussion<br/>\nin homeschooling circles about unschooling, what it is, what it<br/>\nisn&#39;t, and how one does it - or doesn&#39;t. Workshops on unschooling<br/>\nhave become standard fare at homeschool conferences and conventions,<br/>\nand several homeschooling publications have tried to define the word.<br/>\nThere are even derivatives now, like Christian unschooling and<br/>\nstructured unschooling and radical unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is an interesting word, or at least I think it&#39;s<br/>\na word. How many people need to use a word, and more or less<br/>\nunderstand and agree on what it means, before it officially joins our<br/>\nlanguage - as in it gets added to our dictionaries? I don&#39;t think the<br/>\nword homeschooling was around for more than six or seven years before<br/>\nit showed up in a major dictionary. Maybe with a few more years of<br/>\nuseage unschooling will join the ranks of publicly recognized and<br/>\nrespectable words.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to be included in a dictionary, a word needs a<br/>\ndefinition, and unschooling is a particularly difficult word to<br/>\ndefine. Just last month there was a long and involved discussion<br/>\nabout what it means - and doesn&#39;t mean - on one of America Online&#39;s<br/>\nhomeschooling forums. There were those who felt unschooling totally<br/>\nprecludes the use of school-type materials, and those who said the<br/>\nmaterials don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s your attitude that counts. From the<br/>\nonline discussions, one could gather that unschooling generally seems<br/>\nto refer to the act of not learning in the same ways we were expected<br/>\nto learn in school, i.e. with textbooks, workbooks, lesson plans,<br/>\ndrills and all the rest. But many avowed unschoolers said they do use<br/>\nthese handy educational tools, just not always in the ways they were<br/>\noriginally designed for.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost unschoolers agree that it goes a little further than<br/>\nthat, tho, and can mean the entire process of shaking off schoolish<br/>\nhabits, patterns, and expectations. Of course others will say that<br/>\nit&#39;s not a process at all, but just what they do with their kids<br/>\nevery day. It&#39;s their interactions, their interconnectedness, their<br/>\nvery lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Dec/Jan 1995 issue of Growing Without Schooling,<br/>\neditor Susannah Sheffer had some interesting comments on the history<br/>\nof the word &#39;homeschooling,&#39; and I was surprised to learn that<br/>\nunschooling was actually the predecessor of that word. For a long<br/>\ntime now I&#39;ve thought it was the other way around!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusannah noted that John Holt had used the word &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>\nin GWS #2, noting &quot;at the beginning Holt simply used it as a synonym<br/>\nfor what we now call homeschooling.&quot; She adds &quot;By issue #12, which<br/>\nI&#39;d date at June 1979, you can see that the magazine was using<br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39; and &#39;homeschooling&#39; pretty much interchangeably, and<br/>\ngradually the term &#39;homeschooling&#39; became the more common one.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn gives our term an interesting spin in The<br/>\nTeenage Liberation Handbook. Throughout the book she prefers the term<br/>\nunschooling, explaining early on that it has fewer negative<br/>\nconnotations than homeschooling. But in Chapter 11, on Legal Issues,<br/>\nshe writes: &quot;I am shifting my terminology a little. In this chapter,<br/>\nI will mostly use the euphemism &#39;homeschooling&#39; rather than<br/>\n&#39;unschooling.&#39; &#39;Unschooling&#39; is not a legally recognized term, and<br/>\nprobably never will be. Don&#39;t use it when you talk to schools,<br/>\ncourts, or legislators; it will confuse them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, maybe we shouldn&#39;t get our hopes up about getting it<br/>\ninto the dictionaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that matter, do we even want official dictionary-style<br/>\nrecognition of the word&#39;s meaning? Unschooling means many things to<br/>\nmany people... that became quite obvious in the America Online<br/>\ndiscussions. And that&#39;s part of its appeal. Each family, each<br/>\nindividual, can decide what they want it to mean for themselves<br/>\nwithin a loosely-accepted larger context.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an odd dynamic at work in that once a word is<br/>\ndefined, it begins to lose its meaning through overuse,<br/>\noverpopularity. The word homeschooling, officially recognized for<br/>\nsome time now, has been showing up in some strange places, most<br/>\nnotably as what parents do with their children after school and on<br/>\nweekends. Because the term is widely recognized and accepted, it&#39;s<br/>\nbeing used to stretch the meaning of other activities, with the very<br/>\nreal danger that the word&#39;s own original meaning will be completely<br/>\nlost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has already happened with the term &#39;alternative<br/>\nschools.&#39; Where that once meant schools which functioned outside the<br/>\neducational bureaucracy, it now also means special public schools for<br/>\nkids who don&#39;t fit well into the usual regimen. If one uses the term<br/>\nalternative schools but means free schools, or student-participatory<br/>\nschools, or any of the other originally accepted definitions, the<br/>\ndistinction needs to be made clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is still a wonderfully nebulous term, subject to<br/>\nindividual interpretation. Homeschoolers can argue themselves in<br/>\ncircles about what it means, and that&#39;s as it should be. We need<br/>\nwords that are vague yet descriptive, changeable while unchanging. In<br/>\nmuch the same way that homeschoolers have taken leave of the<br/>\neducational bureaucracy, we&#39;ve taken leave of the English language<br/>\nbureaucracy and are exploring new options in communication. We&#39;re<br/>\nunschooling in the best sense of the word.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33590,"nextTopicId":33536}}
