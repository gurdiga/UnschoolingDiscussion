I do have my own business but it can&#39;t be done much<br/>\nduring the day.  We volunteer at an animal shelter once a week (but that<br/>\nis mostly for my son).  It&#39;s clear we need to structure time for me<br/>\nduring the day as well as my son.  I may figure out how I can structure<br/>\nmore time for my business.  I do have times that I need for day<br/>\nappointments and I have a friend who could take him then.  I also enjoy<br/>\ndoing art which I may provide more time for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13654,"nextTopicId":13656}}
