I remember reading aloud parts of The Sheepskin Psychosis<br/>\n(a book which questions the true financial value of college tuition as an<br/>\ninvestment), because he kept insisting that I belonged in college (Id been<br/>\naccepted through early admissions, then ducked out and the last moment and<br/>\nwas swearing Id never go).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing about this scene, with me pacing around in front of the<br/>\nwoodstove declaiming and him shaking his head, was that he had gone all the<br/>\nway through college and med school, and started his residency, before<br/>\nrealizing that hed never really wanted to be a doctor  that it had been<br/>\nhis parents idea, and that what he really wanted to do was to work with his<br/>\nhands in a more elemental way. Hed also told me that hed discovered while<br/>\ndoing his emergency room rotation that he was powerless to help most of his<br/>\npatients. Theyd come to him with some horrible problem that could only<br/>\ntruly be resolved through major lifestyle changes, and all he could do was<br/>\nwrite them a prescription so they would go away and he could get on to the<br/>\nnext one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he could have gone into some form of alternative medicine, given that<br/>\nsuch an enormous amount of effort and money had gone into getting him<br/>\nthrough med school. But, hey, wait  if were going to think of somebodys<br/>\nlife as an investment, maybe all this trouble could have been avoided if<br/>\nhed gotten a taste of the reality of being a doctor way back as a teenager!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my early teens I wanted to be either a doctor or a lawyer because they<br/>\nwere the most difficult college majors I knew of. I suspect a lot of teens<br/>\nwant to be doctors and lawyers because of this, or because of all those<br/>\nflashy TV series about these two professions. Also, its a really safe thing<br/>\nto say when all those adults start coming at you with the question, What do<br/>\nyou want to be? (Its also a safe thing for parents to say to their<br/>\nrelatives and acquaintances.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot saying thats necessarily the case here, of course  I dont know Sarah<br/>\ns daughter. But an unschooling teen has a great advantage in being able to<br/>\ntake the time to explore options live, in the flesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was that age, hospitals accepted volunteers starting at age 14.

Oldest wants to become a doctor. Youngest wants to be a rock star (seriously!). She talks of nothing else and hasn&#39;t for years. <br/>\nI believe I understand what&#39;s expected especially of the doctor one, moreso than the rockstar one. I&#39;ve researched all the &quot;how to become a doctor&quot; and books written by doctors, as well as interviewed several doctor/friends  and they all basically come away with the same thing... it&#39;s important to stand out in your 4 yr college as the best at *whatever* your major(and that can be anything, including a dancer!)  and secondly, it helps if that major is in the sciences.  So, to that end, I consider myself capable of telling my child what she needs to do now in order to get to point &quot;b&quot;. In the context of what technology will be available then, I have no way of forseeing that, either and don&#39;t pretend to. We&#39;re talking different wave lengths here, I think, Susan.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Joseph Fuerst <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 5:54 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: encouraging writing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sarah wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Yes, I agree that you have to be careful &quot;encouraging your children&quot; to<br/>\n  learn something you believe they need to know.
