I know that this topic has been sort of discussed to death, and I&#39;m <br/>\nsorry if my particular question has already addressed.  I have been trying to <br/>\nread all of the posts on the subject (and there are many...LOL) and I am <br/>\nwondering where some of you stand on the sexual content of so many shows and <br/>\nmovies.  My son is 11.  I, personally, do not have a problem with the violent <br/>\naspect because my son is pretty clear on his comfort level.  The same is true <br/>\nof really emotional stuff (death of a parent, friend, pet...stuff like that). <br/>\n The trouble is that there are so many shows and movies that I know he would <br/>\nlove (for their other content...like magic, adventure, etc.) but sometimes <br/>\nthe sexual content is almost pornographic (okay, I&#39;m exaggerating here, <br/>\nLOL... I just find it beyond my comfort level.)  Not just people in bed <br/>\ntogether where it is implied that there has been sex (which is how it was <br/>\nwhen I was growing up.  Most of it went over my head. LOL).  Should I let his <br/>\ncomfort level be our guide in these cases too?  If so, how?  I really <br/>\nstruggle with this, because I feel like I go way overboard with this aspect <br/>\nof TV restriction.
