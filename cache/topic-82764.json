Huge decsion for us!  <br/>\nRight now we are in the preliminary stages of getting the business <br/>\nready to sell, figuring out how his parents will survive or if they <br/>\nshould come with us and of course where our business would do well.  <br/>\nWe are considering the northeast (narrowed down to VA, MD, DE, CT, <br/>\nME, MA, PA, NH, VT and even considering PEI in Canada.  <br/>\n<br/>\n1: How are these states for homeschooling, obviously unschooling in <br/>\nterms of being relaxed?<br/>\n2.

We <br/>\nwould like to continue that and specialize in teas and such.  Anyone <br/>\nknow any places that are needing of such a thing or would appreciate <br/>\nartisan baking and the such.  <br/>\nGo to Portland, Maine. With a very short car ride you can be in a pretty <br/>\nrural area, but the city is big enough and has LOTS of culture. AND it&#39;s only a <br/>\ncouple hours to Boston. I think the homeschooling laws are pretty easy, and it&#39;s <br/>\nhard to get too much more laid-back than Mainers. The city has had a major <br/>\nrenaissance.
