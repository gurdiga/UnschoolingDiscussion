Others do laundry sometimes, but I try to beat them to <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty has left some of his dirty socks balled up, I COULD yell and get <br/>\nhim in there to at least pull them out straight so I don&#39;t have to touch his <br/>\ntoe-grunge, but then I remember that I WANTED Marty, and planned him, and <br/>\nhave cleaned up his shit and puke (though not for many years), and that socks <br/>\nare clean compared to that.  I have held him when he was feverish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I had broken my leg just five days before and it was time for us to <br/>\nfly home from South Carolina to Albuquerque, and I was embarrassed and really <br/>\nafraid that I would need the bathroom on the plane and not be able to manage <br/>\nit, and I was afraid I would maybe cry when strangers were carrying me <br/>\nstrapped to a scary chair on steep, narrow stairways in and out of a Canadair <br/>\njet (too small for the tunnel jetway ramps), Marty was cheerful and <br/>\nreassuring, and entirely attentive and distracting in a sweet way.   I never <br/>\nhad to &quot;tell&quot; him to do anything, and hardly had to ask.  When we were <br/>\nwaiting in Cincinatti airport, and he kept checking to see if I was <br/>\ncomfortable, whether I needed a drink, whether I wanted to move somewhere <br/>\nelse for a different view.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s his fourteenth birthday.  He&#39;s wonderful.  I will miss him when he&#39;s <br/>\ngrown and gone.  He&#39;s half of 28 now, and will be gone relatively soon.  I&#39;m <br/>\nso glad I have photos, and little bit of video, and a lot of notes and <br/>\nmemories.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54889,"nextTopicId":54755}}
