My daughter and<br/>\nstep-daughter are with their great-grandparents for three weeks.  They flew<br/>\nout the 11th and will return on 8-2.  I miss them something awful.  I love<br/>\ntheir company.  They are such a big part of my day.  And my daughter, Amanda<br/>\n has only been away from me for  a week when she went to stay with my<br/>\nparents for a visit.  We are facing a bit of a trial with this visit. <br/>\nAmanda is on a strict gfcf diet for her Autism.  Well, they are not buying<br/>\nher gfcf food, so she is doing her best to stick to it on her own.  When we<br/>\ndiscussed this with my wife&#39;s grandmother, the reply was that she didn&#39;t<br/>\nlook like she was having any problems.  They aren&#39;t around her enough to see<br/>\nthe benefits of the diet.  Oh well, I just encourage Amanda to do her best<br/>\nto stick to fruits and veggies.  We&#39;ll detox her when she gets home.  On the<br/>\nupswing, both girls are enjoying their visit.  We just got a letter today<br/>\nfrom them and they have been swimming, playing ping pong and pool.  They are<br/>\nstaying active :-) My heart goes out to you...I am missing my girls alot too<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\nSarah\r<br/>\nHomeschooling mama to Amanda, 12 1/2 and Ashleigh 12 1/2<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76659,"nextTopicId":76664}}
