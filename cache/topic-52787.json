Her and her two children saw a program about it, I think it may have <br/>\nbeen 60 Minutes. Anyway, as soon as it was over, both of her children said <br/>\nthat&#39;s where they wanted to go. She had been pretty relaxed with them on <br/>\nhomeschooling. They were both getting older and looking for something else. <br/>\nSo, for her children, she up and moved to Oregon. That was the only place <br/>\nthat had a Sudbury school that was public. She couldn&#39;t afford the other <br/>\nones.
