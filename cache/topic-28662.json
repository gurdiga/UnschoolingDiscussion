Brain-f*rt ;-).... they just *did* by taking them *out* of school.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Not if the child requested to be taken out of school. My son recognized before I did that school was not the right place for him to be. My daughter went to Kindergarten (she wanted to) and was appalled at the injustices of the system--the senseless rules, the lack of respect...I think that when a child is used to being treated with respect and consideration, they are very aware and sensitive to what is not &quot;fair,&quot; regardless of their chronological age.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;...A child of 5 or 6 cannot begin to understand the vast differences he will experience if he takes path a). public school or path b). unschool.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think this has less to do with age and more to do with not being able to see the future. When I make a decision for myself, *I* can&#39;t foresee the vast differences I will experience if I take path &quot;a&quot; or path &quot;b&quot;.

Now, on to my post:<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting how homeschoolers (nobody in particular here) take their kids out of schools,thinking to themselves &#39;nobody&#39;s going to tell *me* how to raise my kids, etc&#39; and then get on lists, such as this one, and talk all day about not controlling their kids.  Brain-f*rt ;-).... they just *did* by taking them *out* of school. They have now altered their childrens&#39; path in  numerous and postive ways, I might add.  A child of 5 or 6 cannot begin to understand the vast differences he will experience if he takes path a). public school or path b). unschool.  As the parent of this child, *we* have controlled some of his destiny already.  Was this a *bad* thing to do? No, I don&#39;t think so!  Is control a bad thing? No, not if it&#39;s kept within certain limits. I believe the goal is to raise happy, healthy children. To do so, we have to give them choices as they are able to understand the various  outcomes... it&#39;s a maturity thing. <br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kathy <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 1:08 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hello Snarky List<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Helen Hegener &lt;HEM-Editor@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; Oh my.

That&#39;s cool. I can&#39;t say she <br/>\n  wasn&#39;t hurt, and I can&#39;t say that she didn&#39;t hurt others. It happens. <br/>\n  It&#39;s over.
