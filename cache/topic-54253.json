She drank only water (if you<br/>\nmixed meds in she would not) and breastmilk from the breast. She ate only a<br/>\nfew things and would touch none of them when she was not feeling well,<br/>\ngetting nourishment only from nursing, so it was no good mixing the meds in<br/>\nwith any kind of food.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn desperation I once poured a dose down her and made her swallow it (yes, I<br/>\nam as capable of being an idiot as the next mom &lt;g&gt;) and Mikey looked at me<br/>\npityingly and then threw it up on me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Mikey got over her ear infections with a little warmed garlic oil in the<br/>\near, got past croup by being rocked in steamy bathrooms, and got over colds<br/>\nwith breastmilk and crossed fingers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she had ever had something that was truly life-threatening-without-meds<br/>\nthey would have had to use an injection or an i.v. or whatever. And of<br/>\ncourse no baby is going to choose such a thing and it&#39;s impossible to ask<br/>\ntheir permission. This is where non-coercive and I part company. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, Mikey will take meds -- she&#39;s very stoic, but if she has pain, she&#39;ll<br/>\ntell me, and if I suggest something (for example, for a pulled muscle a<br/>\nchewable pain reliever) she&#39;ll take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrit (8) was easy to dose as a baby, and now extremely finicky about<br/>\nmedications and hates to take them.

Homeopathic remedies are tiony little sugar<br/>\npills and my main problem when they were young was *stopping* them taking them.<br/>\nAs for seat belts and helmets. I&#39;ve explained to them that it is the law. I am required to wear a seatbelt too so that helps. The helmet thingy is trickeir. VA law doesn&#39;t require me to wear one so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t (I know all the stats and arguments and I&#39;ve come down on the &#39;not wearing&#39; side) and UK law doesn&#39;t require helmets for cycling or skating. VA law requires all youg people under 14 to wear one.<br/>\nMy daughter is furious after years of biking without one. So I explained the law, pointed out that it is me that gets in trouble, not her. She now agrees to wear one but complains everytime. Cycle<br/>\nhelmets are badly designed for people wearing glasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think safety laws have gone mad in this country but thats a whole nother topic :-)<br/>\nActually, they are going mad in the UK too. Recently children were forbidden to make daisy chains and pick buttercups in school in case they picked up any bacteria.
