Couldn&#39;t stand the stuff.  But, I<br/>\nbelieve that it is good to retry foods periodically to remember WHY you<br/>\ndon&#39;t like them.  So today, I tried Pecan Pie again.  Great Stuff!  I<br/>\nlove it now.  Over the years, my tastes have changed a lot.  I now eat<br/>\nloads of things I didn&#39;t like when I was younger.  So, my message to all<br/>\nthe young ones out there: it&#39;s okay not to like certain foods.  But try<br/>\nthem every once in a while anyway, just to make sure!<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n          I don&#39;t suffer from insanity, I enjoy every minute of it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27394,"nextTopicId":27446}}
