Like carrying on with <br/>\nmy own interests and leaving her to hers - this did work at first.  <br/>\nYes she is going through puberty - her body shape has changed <br/>\ndrastically in the past couple of months! I also think if I came down <br/>\nto hard on TV she would become very stuborn - we have tried the <br/>\nworksheets.<br/>\nI have always encouraged all my kids to be independant - but house <br/>\nrules have to be kept - Right now I am not sure if to just let her <br/>\nbe, or be the *Teacher*......... <br/>\nToni has written to the local TV studio for information on *makeup <br/>\nartists* - we are still waiting for a reply.  Afraid she is not <br/>\ninterested in any grop activity like Guides - we have tried them <br/>\nall.  And she is not confident enough to do volunteer work.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain Thankyou.
