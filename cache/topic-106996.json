My husband and I were watching it, my 17 year old son","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-693389824\">Today on the &quot;E True Hollywodd&quot; channel there was a show <br/>\ncalled, &quot;what Hollywood Taught us About Sex&quot;. My husband and I were <br/>\nwatching it, my 17 year old son was sitting at the computer that is <br/>\nin our family room...he is my one child NOT remotely embarassed <br/>\nabout sex, he is almost too open if there is such a thing..LOL, some <br/>\nthings a mom just dosen&#39;t need to know..ha<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow..my 13 year old daughter came in and sat down while we were <br/>\nwatching the program. (The program was funny and showed clips from <br/>\nmovies, and then would go into &quot;What&quot; did we learn from this movie <br/>\nabout sex. Example..&quot;Fast times at Ridgemont High&quot;...we may have <br/>\nlearned not to &quot;do it&quot; in a baseball dug out.)She asked what we were <br/>\nwatching, I explained the concept of the program, and told her she <br/>\nwas more then welcome to watch if she felt like it, or I would go <br/>\ninto the other room with her and watch something with her <br/>\nthere...or, did she want to work the puzzle we started this morning? <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said,&quot;I&#39;d like to watch it&quot;. She has seen several programs with <br/>\nsexual conotation and she has two brothers who have been an open <br/>\nbook when it comes to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething came up in the program about having a &quot;Orgasim&quot;. She ask <br/>\nus to pause the Tivo, and then asked, &quot;What is a orgasim?&quot; I <br/>\njokingly looked at my husband and asked, &quot;Do you want to take this <br/>\none?&quot; He said, not really..laughing a little. <br/>\nThen my son said, &quot;It&#39;s why people enjoy sex&quot;. Then she <br/>\nsaid, &quot;oh&quot;...but what IS it? <br/>\n<br/>\nI stepped in at this point and explained it as best I could...I <br/>\nasked her if she has ever had a spot on her body that itched REALLY <br/>\nbad? She said, &quot;Yeah&quot; and then I said,&quot;when you finally itched it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t it feel good?&quot; &quot;Yeah&quot;...I said it&#39;s kinda like that. And that <br/>\nit happens during sex to both a man and a women..or can happen. I <br/>\nasked her if she wanted me to explain it further..she said, &quot;No, <br/>\nThanks Mom&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was most happy with the answer I gave her..my husband and son <br/>\nwere shocked at my explanation of a orgasim. My son said, &quot;Great <br/>\nmom..now she will think if she has a itch she has had a orgasim !!!&quot; <br/>\nWe got to laughing about it later...my son said, &quot;Oh, I have a <br/>\nitch..!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to keep it simple and to the point, in terms I thought she <br/>\nwould understand...my husband and son have been laughing at me ever <br/>\nsince...LOL . They just whish that had thought of my <br/>\nexplaination !!! <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else have this question asked of them? If so, what did you <br/>\nsay? <br/>\n<br/>\nTracymc</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106969,"nextTopicId":106998}}
