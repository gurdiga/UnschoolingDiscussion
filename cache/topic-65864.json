Also, John Taylor <br/>\nGatto. These authors rocked my world, and redefined education (it&#39;s <br/>\nabout learning, not teaching) for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to post lots of questions here, similar to yours, then I went <br/>\naway for a few months, and read the above authors and learned this: <br/>\nThere IS no core knowledge that everyone must have in order to <br/>\nsucceed. Many successful, happy people move along in life just fine <br/>\nwithout (fill in the blank).<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery human being needs to know different things, and each human <br/>\nbeing will learn the things he needs to know. In an unschooling <br/>\nscenario, when the need comes up, the learner will find someone to <br/>\nteach it to him. And then! it&#39;ll be like a sponge sucking up <br/>\nmoisture, the learning will come so easy and so fast and the kid will <br/>\nlove it...until he masters it, or turns to something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s happening with my eight year old whose &quot;formal math education&quot; <br/>\namounted to my teaching her how to write her numbers when she was <br/>\nfive. While I was busy fretting about her late verbal abilities, she <br/>\nwas figuring out how to subtract, how many quarters in $1.00, .50, <br/>\nand .75, how to count by two, five, ten, and heh 25, how to tell time <br/>\nwithout any help from me. That, even more than Holt and Gatto, is <br/>\nwhat brought me back to this group. The fact that my kid was picking <br/>\nup math without me teaching it to her, thus proving not only what is <br/>\nbeing said here and at several unschooling pages (articles), but also <br/>\nwhat Holt and Gatto say in their writings: the human brain will take <br/>\nup knowledge. It&#39;s part of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is, when your girl is ready to get into algebra, she will. <br/>\nBut she might not ever, and that&#39;s okay. But if you let her come to <br/>\nalgebra on her own, so that she is learning it because she needs it <br/>\nor wants it, she will be more likely to learn it well, than if she is <br/>\ntold she needs it, reminded that she needs it, hinted at that she <br/>\nshould learn it, etc. and finally gives in and forces herself to <br/>\nlearn it, in order to please someone else besides herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nsheesh. I didn&#39;t mean to go on so long. I&#39;m at the very beginning of <br/>\ntrusting this, myself. I&#39;m going to be biting my tongue IN HALF while <br/>\nmy middle child (by far the most &quot;schooled&quot; of the three) deschools. <br/>\nBut I do know that they&#39;ll learn what life teaches them they need to <br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace, heidiC who is just at the beginning of this unschooling thing, <br/>\nherself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Thanks for the food for thought, I&#39;ve been thinking about it but <br/>\n </span></blockquote>can&#39;t yet <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; see the comparison, but I&#39;m trying to get it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe instead of completely different types of cookies, they are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the slice <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; and bakes or microwaved instead of a conventional oven.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks again for making me THINK, I LOVE it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; glena<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Math phobia, again","postDate":"1051587292","msgId":66462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4LjJmOThlNzEwLjJiZGY0Y2RjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66460,"nextInTopic":66463,"prevInTime":66461,"nextInTime":66463,"topicId":65864,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/28/03 8:12:25 PM, rubyprincesstsg@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1504025381\">In a message dated 4/28/03 8:12:25 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Sandra, thank you so much for taking such an active role in helping me to <br/>\nso <br/>\ndeeply search my motives and I can appreciate that you can know the meaning <br/>\nin my words beyond even my own comprehension. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo problem!

I learned because it was expected, required, mandatory, not <br/>\n  for the LOVE of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n  No matter if it&#39;s poetry or algebra, art or geometry I want her to be able to <br/>\n  embrace each part of learning with enjoyment of absorbing and learning <br/>\n  something new.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just didn&#39;t have any idea how MATH could possibly be FUN or enjoyable and <br/>\n  not just a task to be completed or learned.

Wanting her <br/>\nto LOVE EVERY aspect of learning, even the things you need/want/have to <br/>\nlearn later in life to reach your goals.*****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think you are missing is that no one loves every aspect of learning.  <br/>\nEVEN when they WANT to learn it.  I love food.  Most of the time I love <br/>\ncooking it, too.  I want to learn more about cooking and healthy eating, but <br/>\nI don&#39;t always enjoy every little aspect of it.  I don&#39;t like cleaning the <br/>\ndishes!  I don&#39;t like how messy my kitchen gets just to cook a decent meal.  <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t stop me from wanting to learn better eating habits, better <br/>\nrecipes, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is highly unrealistic to want anyone to LOVE EVERY aspect of <br/>\nlearning.  Even in the best of unschooling situations, completely child-led, <br/>\nthe child will come across something he doesn&#39;t enjoy, much less LOVE!  <br/>\nSometimes, it IS the means to an end!  I think perservering through the <br/>\nyucky spots helps us take even more pride in our success!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can stop your brain tape of (Oh ick, how Dr. Phil of me!) what YOU <br/>\nwant for HER to love then you can begin to allow HER to find what SHE loves. <br/>\n  Does that make sense?  I don&#39;t know how else to say it to help you <br/>\nunderstand, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust hang in there and keep listening.  Grab a pen and paper and write down <br/>\nall YOUR wants, needs, desires for her and go back and see if it is in YOUR <br/>\ninterest, or hers.  I think you may be a bit surprised.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all want the best for our children.  I think it is important to <br/>\nunderstand they aren&#39;t us though.  They can&#39;t make up for our failures, <br/>\nshorcomings or relive our lives for us.  It is perfectly ok to want better <br/>\nfor our children, but we have to stop our own brain baggage and let them <br/>\nfind their own way.  She may very well grow up HATING math!  What would that <br/>\nmean to you?  Does that mean she failed?  Does that mean YOU failed?  What <br/>\nif she absorbs herself in writing and becomes an author someday, instead of <br/>\na doctor?  She&#39;ll only need enough math to balance her checkbook and count <br/>\nchange and that should pretty well cover any other math skills needed for <br/>\nthe average person on an average day.  I don&#39;t think that is such a bad <br/>\nthing.  I wonder if you do, though?<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.

I have found some new ways to lay <br/>\naround and share with her but I&#39;m not in the panic mode I was before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still wish I knew some magic math fun but I&#39;m not panicking that I will <br/>\nhave failed her as a mother by not introducing her to it and helping her to <br/>\nunderstand and love it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"gruvystarchild","from":"&quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Math phobia, again","postDate":"1051335366","msgId":65864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4ZDVzNitxZGwzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66269,"prevInTime":65863,"nextInTime":65865,"topicId":65864,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Glena, You say you never got a direct NO about the math and kept pushing, and yet THIS was your first post on the topic: So I have the conversation about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1848682334\">Glena,<br/>\nYou say you never got a direct &quot;NO&quot; about the math and kept pushing, <br/>\nand yet THIS was your first post on the topic:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So I have the conversation about what you are going to do with your <br/>\nlife and <br/>\nget the usual response that they are going to go to college and <br/>\nbecome a <br/>\ndoctor. Always the same answer since this child was five. I expected <br/>\nit <br/>\nwould change somewhere along the line but it hasn&#39;t. So am I helping <br/>\nprepare <br/>\nher to meet her dreams and hopes for the future?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I probably am, except maybe in math which she seems to lack <br/>\nmuch <br/>\ninterest in so I don&#39;t bring it up. We&#39;ve studied latin together, <br/>\nwe&#39;ve <br/>\nstudied so much together actually BUT you HAVE to be strong in math <br/>\nto get in <br/>\na premed program, you just have too. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I tell her maybe she would want to look at some Algebra stuff <br/>\nthat I <br/>\nbought for the computer. And she doesn&#39;t. So I suggest maybe she look <br/>\nonline and see what kind of stuff google will offer her with the <br/>\ntyping of <br/>\nAlgebra. She doesn&#39;t care.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I have to go into a lengthy discussion that while I don&#39;t care <br/>\nif she <br/>\never learns algebra or not, that SHE wants to go to medical school <br/>\nand at <br/>\nsome point if she can&#39;t bring herself to learn math she&#39;s just not <br/>\ngoing to <br/>\nsee that dream realized, which is fine by me, but I want her to know <br/>\nthe <br/>\nfacts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds to me like a Mom that is pushing.<br/>\nTHAT is what we were responding to.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also said that you hoped a book I suggested would MAKE her want <br/>\nmath. It was all about what you thought she needed and hoping she&#39;d <br/>\nlearn a certain thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that you keep using your dd&#39;s math resistance as ammo <br/>\nagainst this list is more than slightly frustrating, in light of what <br/>\nyou wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing their paths is not about what we WANT them to absorb.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just about living interesting lives and sharing our passions <br/>\nwith each other. <br/>\nI don&#39;t try to get math into my kids but I do expose them to lots of <br/>\nopportunities.<br/>\nThere is a world of difference.<br/>\nCan you not see that?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67683,"nextTopicId":67686}}
