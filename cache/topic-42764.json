Not all the families were <br/>\nunschoolers, but since it was clearly called an unschooling group, they kept <br/>\nthe curriculum talk down, and kids played, and parents socialized and played, <br/>\nand we had fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys got to old to want to be in a group, and were tired of it.  Holly was <br/>\nstill fairly young, 8 or 9, when another group started in town with lots of <br/>\nkids.  I used to take her, and then I started letting her arrange to go with <br/>\nother families if she wanted to, but I have a hard time going.  I only go <br/>\nonce in a great while.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s why:<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople want to talk to me.  They want to take me aside and sit down and say <br/>\nmy kids are SO wonderful and they want their kids to be like mine, but their <br/>\nkids just won&#39;t do their math, or as soon as their kids can read well enough <br/>\nto learn on their own, they might think about considering unschooling too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy choices at that point are to smile and nod and think about England until <br/>\nthey&#39;re through talking or to talk about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I do the former, I&#39;m being dishonest.  I think there&#39;s nothing to smile <br/>\nand nod about if people want me to coo and agree that gosh darn, it IS hard <br/>\nto make kids do math.  Because I&#39;ve never made kids do math, and I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto start.  I think they&#39;re wasting their own time and their children&#39;s joy by <br/>\ndoing it.  They&#39;ve gone to an inclusive group meeting and not an unschooling <br/>\nmeeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I do the latter, I&#39;m spending twenty minutes of time I could have been <br/>\nhanging around with Holly or talking to people I&#39;ve known for years about <br/>\nother teenged homeschoolers I&#39;ve known since they first left school.  THAT <br/>\nwould be okay, but I invariably am asked to talk to someone individually.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my choice is being dishonest or honest, I&#39;m going to be honest.  <br/>\nIf my choice is to be at peace or stressed, I&#39;m going with peace, so I&#39;d <br/>\nrather stay home.<br/>\nBut if my choice is being useful or pissing my time away, I&#39;d rather be <br/>\nuseful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s better for me to write where I can leave things for people to come <br/>\nback to.  It&#39;s better for me to only be involved with clearly-delineated <br/>\nunschooling sites and activities, and put no effort into helping people learn <br/>\nabout what curriculum to buy, or how to inspire kids to like workbooks, or <br/>\nhow to design unit studies.  I cannot in good conscience help someone do <br/>\nsomething I don&#39;t think is good for their kids or for their relationship with <br/>\ntheir kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel guilty about not going to the playgroup (which is not just a <br/>\nplaygroup, though they call it that), because I&#39;ve totally done my time for <br/>\nyears and years, locally.

It depends on your purpose, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by all the different <br/>\ncurriculums out there - so I know a lot about them (especially math) <br/>\nand so it is natural that people ask me about them. That is my own <br/>\npersonal difficulty - that people want me to help them evaluate math <br/>\ncurriculum. It isn&#39;t like they are all created equal - there are some <br/>\nthat are MUCH more harmful than others, imo. So - I try to be <br/>\ngoodnatured about it - I can&#39;t make myself withhold information, so I <br/>\ndo give my opinions, but I constantly (albeit gently) remind them that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t NEED it at all. AND, when I give my &quot;official&quot; math talks, I <br/>\nrefuse to recommend any math curriculum at all because I am <br/>\nspecifically talking about unschooling math at those times.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers here will say that they couldn&#39;t in good conscience help people <br/>\nfind curriculum materials - that it would be wrong, against what they <br/>\nreally believe is good for kids. I agree with that - but think that if <br/>\nI can get someone to stop using textbooks and try some unit studies <br/>\nthat THAT is a good step for them and so I feel okay about helping them <br/>\ndo that as long as I can get a chance to point out that they don&#39;t have <br/>\nto DO that either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sunday, April 6, 2003, at 09:49 AM, The Burton Bunch wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  I guess my question here is how to continue helping those just <br/>\n&gt; getting their feet wet with homeschooling - - letting them know that I <br/>\n&gt; unschool, but being available to answer other questions too without <br/>\n&gt; sounding phony - because that is truly how I feel when I talk about <br/>\n&gt; using the pre- packaged, workbooks, unit studies, etc. Unschooling <br/>\n&gt; makes perfect sense and I get frustrated when people just don&#39;t seem <br/>\n&gt; to get it.
