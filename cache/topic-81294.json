It is imo all about the Power of <br/>\nStory.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Pleasantville is one of our family favorites for just these unschool-y <br/>\nreasons. Then we discovered Strictly Ballroom last week and had great fun <br/>\nrelating its themes back to Pleasantville, Dirty Dancing, and Footloose. We <br/>\ndecided the Preacher in Footloose, the Mayor in Pleasantville, and the toupeed <br/>\nDance Association head in Strictly Ballroom (Barry I think) all were the same <br/>\ncharacter, embodying the repressive forces of convention, keeping the populace in <br/>\nline so people can&#39;t grow beyond the bounds those leaders represent and <br/>\nbelieve are necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n       As an academic thinker, what I like about the heroes in each of these <br/>\nmovies is that they beat the controller-standardizers at their own game. In <br/>\nother words, they aren&#39;t brought up as rebels or indoctrinated to rebel. They <br/>\ndon&#39;t set out to be rebels at all, and they don&#39;t come to it by default because <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t able enough to excel within the rules. Instead they come to it <br/>\ngradually and reluctantly, for their own reasons. It is a personal journey with <br/>\nmeaning only to that young person who tries first of all to fit in rather than <br/>\nto rebel. <br/>\n<br/>\n       The Strictly Ballroom dancer was the best at all the conventional <br/>\nsteps, and then he needed even more, to grow beyond their limits. Tobey Maguire <br/>\nknew and loved everything about the old black-and-white tv world -- he didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to rebel, but eventually it happened in spite of his desire to fit in, just <br/>\nbecause its limits couldn&#39;t hold him forever. <br/>\n<br/>\n       The preacher&#39;s daughter in Footloose who just wants to rebel and run <br/>\naway has a horrible time of it until she&#39;s inspired to understand her own <br/>\nfeelings and her father&#39;s feelings as well. Same with the Dirty Dancing daughter, <br/>\nwho is such a good girl in every way, until she meets the rebel dance teacher <br/>\nand her generous heart grows even more, finally breaking through beyond <br/>\nsocietal limitations. All the successful hero characters first steep themselves in <br/>\nthe rules and boundaries and learn to understand them, thereby also learning <br/>\nabout and eventually exceeding their own limitations through experience. These <br/>\nare acts of personal growth and discovery, not social rebellion.<br/>\n<br/>\n       That&#39;s how we see unschooling. That&#39;s the Power of Our Story.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Not trying to rebel or decide anything for anyone else, or reform the <br/>\npublic schools or take over homeschooling. We are simply being true to our own <br/>\nfamily&#39;s journey of personal growth and discovery. We do this just like in <br/>\nthe movies, by first knowing more than most people about what those boundaries <br/>\nare and how to live within them and what is possible beyond them. And <br/>\nsometimes, it just happens to have revolutionary import of which we never dreamed! :)  <br/>\nJJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; One movie that I associate with unschooling, because it is about <br/>\n&gt; thinking outside the box, and living life passionately (but it is NOT <br/>\n&gt; for little kids...) is Pleasantville.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Toby McGuire and Reese Witherspoon both star, and it may be the <br/>\n&gt; first  big movie for both of them.
