Do you not think unschooling is <br/>\nbetter than ps or school at home?  Isn&#39;t that why you chose to do <br/>\nit?  And don&#39;t you think that giving chldren control over their <br/>\nlearning is better for most if not all kids, not just yours?  Every <br/>\ntime we make a choice about something, we are judging its value.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Or maybe some people recognize that things change. In Richard Bach&#39;s <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Illusions&quot; (one of my personal all-time favorites) there&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>something <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; along the lines of &quot;Ask yourself these questions once in a while: <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; am I? Where am I going? Where have I been? - and see how the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>answers <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; change.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I try hard not to judge people but when I see someone shaming their <br/>\nchild or some such thing it is hard not to make some judgement.  I <br/>\nwas talking with some moms a couple of years ago and a mother <br/>\nmentioned that she had told her seven year old son to call his penis <br/>\nand testicles his monkey and coconuts and how when he asked what <br/>\nsanitary napkins were, she told him they were throat warmers.  Now, I <br/>\nthink that is just the same as telling him that he better not ask her <br/>\nquestions about sexuality because she won&#39;t answer them honestly, not <br/>\nto mention what it says to me about whether or not she is likely to <br/>\ntreat her son respectfully. If I knew that when she was a child she <br/>\nwas slapped every time she asked such a question, then I could <br/>\nrecognize and appreciate that she is doing better than what was done <br/>\nto her and maybe if she has younger children, she will come even <br/>\nfarther and answer them.  However, I still think it&#39;s even better to <br/>\nbe honest with your kids.  And I can allow for the possibility that <br/>\nshe may not ever get to a place where she can do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Some people don&#39;t believe they&#39;re doing the best they can do.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;wish they had other jobs, or ate better, or went to church more, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or weeded<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;their yards more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that I am doing the best I can do in several areas of <br/>\nmy life;  I can be a better parent and I don&#39;t weed my yard nearly <br/>\nenough.  I had to smile at that example because we live in between <br/>\ntwo homes of truly superior gardeners and I used to feel badly about <br/>\nthat.  But then I realized that right now my energy goes towards <br/>\nbeing a better parent and just accepted that having a beautiful <br/>\ngarden is not a priority in my life right now.  That doesn&#39;t mean my <br/>\nneighbors are better people, but they are definitely superior <br/>\ngardeners.  And if they want to base their opinion of me as a <br/>\nneighbor on the condition of my yard, then so be it.

My son had problems in school since the beginning.  I even went so far as to have him tested (due to his kindergarten teacher&#39;s insistence) and &#39;they&#39; found him to be ADHD, ODD, and bulemic (vomiting since 18mos. with no physiological reason found.  I personally believe it is mainly due to anxiety).  He was 5 years old.  I was advised to medicate him. During that time I was researching on the internet about ADHD and &#39;discovered&#39; homeschooling.  I had not even thought of that as an option.  I was so upset, and I am still a little bitter, that no one tells you that you have a choice of sending your child/ren to school or keeping them home. The many doctors, counselors, other parents, grandparents, and friends gave a lot of advice but no one ever mentioned homeschooling, much less UNschooling.  It was like a bright beacon of light at the end of the long, dark tunnel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe did return to school after staying home a year and things did seem to be going okay.....for a while........then it got worse again.  I really tried to &#39;play by their rules&#39; and fully encourage school, be the room mother, etc...but it just didn&#39;t feel right at all.  I think all along I knew that my children needed to be home with me and that&#39;s what we are doing now.  School started here last week and we are still doing the &#39;happy dance&#39; every morning at 9am when they get up and realize that they would have been late for school if we were going.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to thank everyone on the list for the continuing support, advice, and encouragement.  I joined this list in the spring (when my kids were still in school) and by &#39;listening&#39; to all of the posts, I firmed up my beliefs about what is right for my family.

She hated it.  She wished she didn&#39;t have <br/>\nto.  But she just didn&#39;t know there was another way.  She might have <br/>\nvaguely heard of homeschooling, but didn&#39;t know anyone who ever did <br/>\nit.

As far as most people <br/>\nare concerned their only choice is whether or not to send their kids <br/>\nto pre-K.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing is true with a lot of things.

I don&#39;t unschool <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t believe the school-at-home approach isn&#39;t best for my <br/>\nkids, I unschool because school at home isn&#39;t good for any kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I do believe I&#39;ve made a superior choice.

With practice, I have become able to<br/>\ntell the difference between the sincerely-interested and the<br/>\ninsincerely-interested &lt;g&gt; and either give helpful, longer answers to the<br/>\nformer or smile and change the subject with the latter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with anything else, people will see what you do and if their family is<br/>\nhaving a consistently hard and stressful time and they see your family<br/>\nhaving a consistently peaceful and happy time, they may come to realize they<br/>\ncan change if they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis goes back to what Dar (I think) was saying about single moms and<br/>\naffording homeschooling and all that -- it&#39;s a matter of priorities. If job<br/>\nor city or neighborhood or proximity to family is a higher priority than<br/>\nfreedom in education, that&#39;s fine, but I think there is rarely (very rarely?<br/>\nsomewhat rarely? don&#39;t know) a real &quot;can&#39;t&quot; to homeschooling, for those who<br/>\nreally want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sounding superior?","postDate":"1030569143","msgId":42404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5OTJCNEY3LkM0RjIlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PHAwNTAwMTliMGI5OTJkZTIyODZmMEBbMjA4LjI2LjIyNy4yMTFdPg=="},"prevInTopic":42401,"nextInTopic":42413,"prevInTime":42403,"nextInTime":42405,"topicId":42277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *I* think it s just a sloppy way of expressing the feeling that they respect that different people have different needs and find different ways of meeting","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-643497635\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; At 3:53 PM -0400 8/28/02, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I think it&#39;s fear of confrontation or fear of people asking more questions<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that makes people say &quot;I think all religions are equal&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sure<br/>\n&gt;&gt; vegetarianism is no better than hot-dog-scarfing&quot; or whatever people are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; willing to base their lives and decisions on, but aren&#39;t willing to ADMIT<br/>\n&gt;&gt; they base their lives and decisions on...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on 8/28/02 4:17 PM, Helen Hegener at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or maybe some people recognize that things change.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*I* think it&#39;s just a sloppy way of expressing the feeling that they respect<br/>\nthat different people have different needs and find different ways of<br/>\nmeeting them. It&#39;s just a socially current phrase that people have found<br/>\nresonates with the feeling they have inside but haven&#39;t bothered examining<br/>\nclosely enough to put words to.

She didn&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;ve made a<br/>\nsuperior choice therfore I&#39;m a superior person.&quot; She just said &quot;I&#39;ve made a<br/>\nsuperior choice.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever committed to something because it&#39;s inferior or no better than<br/>\nanything else?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs she says later judgement of a person is based on why they made a choice,<br/>\nnot on the choice they made. Someone who chooses to send her children to<br/>\nschool because she feels she&#39;s doing the best she can for them is superior<br/>\nto someone who homeschools because she&#39;s tired of being hassled by the<br/>\nschool. (Perhaps not a realistic example but the best I could come up with<br/>\non the spur of the moment. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Some people don&#39;t believe they&#39;re doing the best they can do.

But when someone makes a decision like taking a child out<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of school and it&#39;s not JUST about that one child&#39;s needs at the moment but it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; involves their belief that schools are harmful and that homeschooling is<br/>\n&gt;&gt; better in MANY ways, they might as well admit they think it&#39;s better in many<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Helen:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If one truly believed that then there&#39;s no reason why they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; anyway, but what about those who aren&#39;t so certain that homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; is better?

There seems to be <br/>\na popular misconception that unschooling or homeschooling in general <br/>\ntakes vast amounts of time and patience on the part of a parent. In <br/>\nmy experience it doesn&#39;t take any more of either than thoughtful <br/>\nparenting should rightfully take anyway, and in fact, as our kids got <br/>\nolder it seemed like they took increasingly less time and patience <br/>\nthan their public schooled friends, whose parents were always running <br/>\nhere and there either transporting them to events or attending things <br/>\nor buying them stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always wondered how much the wheels of economy are greased by <br/>\nthis constant buzz of activity. I went to Wal-Mart with my mom <br/>\nyesterday and was amazed to see a rack with lists of school supplies <br/>\nfrom the various schools around the area; kids and parents were <br/>\nscanning the rack and seizing the list for their school... Out of <br/>\nsheer curiousity I ventured down the school supplies aisle and sure <br/>\nenough - there were scads of parents and children busily filling <br/>\ntheir carts with items on their lists. I must not get out enough <br/>\nbecause this struck me as pretty weird, but these folks all seemed to <br/>\ntake it in stride.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere was I? Oh yeah, patience. I don&#39;t think patience is a virtue <br/>\nwe&#39;re born with. I think we need to learn how valuable it is to apply <br/>\npatience as liberally as possible, especially where smallish children <br/>\nare concerned. I know I didn&#39;t start out as a patient person; it took <br/>\nquite a while for me to figure out how to really listen to what my <br/>\nkids were saying, and I know I&#39;m still learning now with my <br/>\ngrandkids. It&#39;s interesting to watch how their parents react to <br/>\nthings they say, and how I get a totally different interpretation <br/>\nbased on body language, tone, attitude and other subtle and <br/>\nnot-so-subtle indicators. Their parents tend to take things at <br/>\nsurface value - they said this so they must want that - whereas I&#39;ve <br/>\npointed out a number of times that there&#39;s more going on with little <br/>\nkids than meets the eye, or the ear. Case in point: the eternal &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nhungry,&quot; which sometimes does mean they&#39;re hungry, but more often <br/>\nthan not means they&#39;re bored, or restless, or want attention, or want <br/>\nto distract attention from something else (usually something they <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be doing), or any of a number of other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1294635,"authorName":"Helen Hegener","from":"Helen Hegener &lt;HEM-Editor@...&gt;","profile":"hemhelen","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sounding superior?","postDate":"1030558783","msgId":42377,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNTAwMTk5ZmI5OTJjMjk5MDkzYUBbMjA4LjI2LjIyNy4yMTFdPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0LjJjNzhkMzFhLjJhOWU1ODU5QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGU0LjJjNzhkMzFhLjJhOWU1ODU5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42360,"nextInTopic":42378,"prevInTime":42376,"nextInTime":42378,"topicId":42277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They always sounds<br/>\nslightly superior to me, like unschooling is the best for *our* children<br/>\nbut let&#39;s remember to be kind to those *other* children who aren&#39;t as<br/>\nfortunate and have to settle for second best.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a choice. I didn&#39;t even consider it to be a very extreme one, at<br/>\nleast it wasn&#39;t for me. I think people with unsupportive spouses or<br/>\nextended families where everyone is a public school teacher have a much<br/>\nharder time unschooling than I did as a single mom taking care of my<br/>\nchild all alone. I don&#39;t actually know of any single moms who decided<br/>\nthey wanted to homeschool, tried to make it work, and ended up sending<br/>\ntheir kids to school because they couldn&#39;t do it financially. OTOH, I<br/>\nknow *lots* of homeschooling single moms who seem to be doing just fine.<br/>\nMaybe you don&#39;t take your dream job, or you don&#39;t live in your dream<br/>\ncity, but there are always trade-offs in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"OUT of school to home (was Digest Number 2296)","postDate":"1030497580","msgId":42277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5ZC43YmUwODQxLjJhOWQ3ZjJjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42324,"prevInTime":42276,"nextInTime":42278,"topicId":42277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/27/02 5:37:48 PM, PSoroosh@aol.com writes:  I am afraid I ...

The public schools? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was at a barbecue with several families.  One homeschools. One was <br/>\ngoing to homeschooling meetings last year with her four year old daughter.  <br/>\nOne family doesn&#39;t homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly told me this afternoon that the mom of the four year old said she was <br/>\ngoing to put her in school, partly because it was free daycare, and partly <br/>\nbecause she had asked the girl to write down her ABCs and the child refused, <br/>\nso she should go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That SO SAD,&quot; Holly said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of the other family she said the mom was reporting that the first morning <br/>\nof school he didn&#39;t want to get up and refused to go.  &quot;When he got home&quot; <br/>\n(she said, which means his refusal didn&#39;t work) he said &quot;I don&#39;t want to go <br/>\nback to school. I want to be homeschooled like Josh.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her if the mom was likely to let him, and she didn&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me, though, of what might be a good thing for some people, and <br/>\nwill surely be a bad thing for many more:  Our proving that there is an <br/>\noption will make many children resent school and their parents even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little and there was really NO option it was easier for parents <br/>\nand children to resign themselves to what they saw as inevitable.  And for <br/>\nsome parents now it is still inevitable.  Ijust got e-mail from a single mom <br/>\nfriend of mine who works full time in Washington DC.  She just got a better <br/>\njob and is thrilled. But it&#39;s expensive to live there and she&#39;s taking care <br/>\nof her son all alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there are extreme options, but not easy options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe we need to remember to be compassionate in this back-to-school <br/>\nseason and not do the happy dance TOO publicly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75818,"nextTopicId":75858}}
