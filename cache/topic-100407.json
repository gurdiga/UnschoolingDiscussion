There&#39;s a very interesting essay about these issues in<br/>\nDouglas Hofstadter&#39;s book &quot;Meta Magical Themas,&quot; particularly as it<br/>\nrelates to translating titles and the &quot;slip-ability&quot; of our concepts and<br/>\nwords.  Stanislaw Lem is a Polish author (highly recommended by the way)<br/>\nwhose work is stuffed full of all kinds of wordplay, and I believe all<br/>\nof his work was originally written in Polish.  In one of his short<br/>\nstories (which I read in an English translation) someone is challenged<br/>\nto write a poem about a particular subject in a particular meter where<br/>\nevery word starts with the letter s.  The translation does it!  I would<br/>\ndie to know what sort of changes this entailed!  Does the original have<br/>\nthe same subject?  Use the same letter?  Same meter?  Sadly, I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow anyone that speaks polish to check it out for me ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo try gamely to wrestle this back around to unschooling... is there<br/>\nanyone on the list who has kids (or is a kid) interested in learning a<br/>\nsecond language in a non-class environment?  What kinds of strategies<br/>\nwork for people?  I&#39;m currently trying to read the first Harry Potter<br/>\nbook side by side in english and spanish.
