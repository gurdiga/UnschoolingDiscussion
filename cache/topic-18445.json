It&#39;s bone chilling to me., this neighborhood isn&#39;t THAT safe.<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\nSad but true, many children are left to wander unsupervised, play in the street, near rivers and canals, etc.  This area is terrible for that.  There was a death in the paper last winter of an 18 month old left in his pajamas in the cab of a truck all day while his father went hunting.  Another recent death involved a three year old left to play by the Snake River with a five and 6 year old in supervision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not even let my 3 and 4 year old children play in our own backyard unless they are adult supervised.  But our next door neighbor&#39;s five year old public schooled child (now age 7) was andering the neighborhood at will for hours, crossing streets etc, when she was 5.  They were always wandering around calling her at dusk, usually her older sister, since her mother could not be bothered.  She also went into neighbors homes to play that her parents did not know, played with older kids, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18452,"nextTopicId":18479}}
