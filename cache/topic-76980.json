The last time he saw <br/>\nthem Grandpa was trying to run out of a mall with him while Grandma and Aunt <br/>\ntried to keep me busy. I spotted him and ran to get my son. He was 3 maybe 4, he <br/>\nhad no idea what was happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called his biological dad who by the way has never seen or met him. I told <br/>\nhim what happened and that I was getting an order against them. He and I <br/>\nagreed that since I was remarried and his Mom was controlling and abusive that it <br/>\nwas best if he relinquished rights so he did. Kinda sad but the best situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey tried to come once someone at their home even told the local police that <br/>\nthey had flown here. We packed the kids and took the dirt road out of here. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey say he is considered a king as he is the first male grandchild. They <br/>\nhave savings accounts and stocks in his name. I don&#39;t know how they did that?  <br/>\nThey tried to buy his love when they where here. No amount of money or court <br/>\nwill cause me to send him to visit them when I know he will not be safe.  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; In Pennsylvania and several other states, grandparents do have the <br/>\nright to get court-ordered visitation rights to their grandkids.  It really <br/>\nbothers me that this should even be necessary, though.  You would think we <br/>\nwould all <br/>\nhave the maturity to work these things out like adults.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76545,"nextTopicId":76999}}
