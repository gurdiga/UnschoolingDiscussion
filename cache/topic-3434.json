Americans in general <br/>\ndon&#39;t celebrate death and are typically very fearful of it, and want to avoid <br/>\nit at all costs. To think that millions of Americans would celebrate <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s death says much about the hatred and vengeful attitude that would <br/>\nbe in their heart for having that celebration, not much different from the <br/>\nhatred some people have for us as a country. I, for one, would not celebrate <br/>\nbin Laden&#39;s death.  If he is proven to be the mastermind behind the attacks I <br/>\nsincerely hope he is brought to justice, but my idea of justice does not <br/>\ninclude state sanctioned murder.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Homeschool4us123@aol.com","from":"Homeschool4us123@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jFeCSxZ1_TGJhDTQ0W9mrt297wsi0287BqtPwGSkTzCtDiP42a1p7-RXJG2OfOgMCYU4KzW9tbe0yxS4IJ6r","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Holiday","postDate":"1001446314","msgId":26242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMi4yMWU1NGU2LjI4ZTIzNWFhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3435,"nextInTopic":26243,"prevInTime":26241,"nextInTime":26243,"topicId":3434,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HOLIDAY. . .

I<br/>\nprepare the turkey & dressing, sweet potatoes & potatoe salad for<br/>\nThanksgiving dinner.  Then everyone else brings the rest of the meal<br/>\n(Grandma better not show up without her banana pudding or she won&#39;t be<br/>\nallowed in the house!). We have 6 kids. For a while my entire family (I&#39;m<br/>\none of three kids), my husband&#39;s family (he&#39;s oldest of 4) and any friends<br/>\nthat wanted to come were invited.  We have seen some Thanksgivings of 30-35<br/>\npeople in the house for dinner.  People would eat where ever they could find<br/>\nsomewhere to sit.  Then a poker game usually breaks out!<br/>\n<br/>\nRight after Thanksgiving  I decorate the house.  During the first weekend of<br/>\nDecember we would go to Penland SC to cut our tree, eat at one of the &quot;fish<br/>\ncamps&quot; in Gastonia, NC and go thru McAdenville to see Christmas Town all<br/>\naglow. (A truly wonderful sight).  The past couple of years we have had to<br/>\nforego this part and find a local cut your own lot. And I truly do miss the<br/>\nroad trip. Decorating the tree means that Dad is in charge of the lights,<br/>\nkids the ornaments, and mom the tinsel; Christmas carols MUST be playing and<br/>\ncider and hot chocolate served.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Christmas Eve we attend a candle light service at church, stop by<br/>\nGrandma&#39;s for a very brief visit then come home to do our own Christmas<br/>\nrituals. Our own personal ritual includes getting into Jammies, setting out<br/>\nSanta&#39;s goodies, lighting a fire and reading.  Each year the person reading<br/>\nseems to change now.  The oldest child reads Twas the Night Before<br/>\nChristmas, I read the Luke version of the Christmas story.  Then Dad and the<br/>\noldest child read  an &quot;Advent Service&quot; that my husband wrote--taking into<br/>\naccount that 5 of our children are adopted--and the advent wreath is<br/>\nlighted.  It is a really special time for us and one that I really do<br/>\ntreasure.  My oldest daughter has commented on how much she misses this part<br/>\nof the season since she is now out on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Christmas morning, after gifts and some breakfast we just play and enjoy.<br/>\nWe go to Grandmas for lunch (taking 1 or two dishes for the potluck) and<br/>\nexchange gifts there.  We draw names and have a $10 limit.  Very young<br/>\nchildren do not participate in the name drawing and get gifts from<br/>\nGrandparents and anyone else deciding to give them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26398,"nextTopicId":26464}}
