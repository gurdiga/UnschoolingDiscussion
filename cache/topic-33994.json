For","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-701174055\">This is a networking and discussion list for unschoolers. The primary purpose of the list is to create opportunities for dialoging about unschooling. For purposes of discussion on this list, unschooling is child led learning where young people are free to choose the what, when, and where of their learning, and parents are facilitators or helpers for them. Additionaly, our definition of dialog is a type of discourse which invites self and group exploration in search of useful information and insights. A dialog is NOT a discussion in which participants make and defend a point with the intention of convincing others. Rather, it is an opportunity to share one&#39;s perspective in a way that invites others to do the same in a joint search for new and valuable ideas. All are welcome on the list, but please keep in mind that unschooling and how to get to unschooling is the focus of the list. Hence, the expression and coexistence of diverse viewpoints is encouraged while tolerance and civility are expected. Posts which are primarily argumentative or defensive or otherwise focused on proving ones perspective &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; will not be tolerated.<br/>\nAll of us together can create a list where learning opportunities abound. Thank you for your cooperation in this.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33991,"nextTopicId":33999}}
