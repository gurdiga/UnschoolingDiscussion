I am a single, <br/>\nunschooling mom and we barely get by but it&#39;s a choice I&#39;ve made money vs. being <br/>\nthere for my son. It can be sooo hard...I really don&#39;t have any concrete <br/>\nsuggestions but just wanted you to know there&#39;s someone else out there in similiar <br/>\ncircumstances. I&#39;m working at home freelance editing and just started <br/>\nwriting. I&#39;m also an Usborne books educational consultant and know of people making <br/>\nvery comfortable incomes that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are very, very, very blessed in that my parents help out tremendously. I <br/>\nput a nice sized down payment on our house and my parents are currently, paying <br/>\nthe mortgage....so we co-own it, but the house is in their name and it has <br/>\nalmost doubled in value. It&#39;s a pretty safe and lucrative investment and I will <br/>\npay them back when we decide to sell or when I&#39;m making more money.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be possible to caretake a house or help on a farm in exchange for <br/>\nfree housing and living expenses? There are so many homes in Bucks County (and <br/>\nall over PA) that are second and third homes w/guesthouses or private wings. <br/>\nPerhaps you could post flyers in the area? There is a Fresh Fields in or around <br/>\nJenkintown, that may be a place to start and also Newtown, Yardley, New Hope <br/>\nand across the river there. Also, Lancaster County is up and coming and trendy <br/>\nw/huge homes so ythat may be an option, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\nDebbie~:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 5/27/04 6:37:03 PM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes: <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can&#39;t bear to think of the girls going back to school- it makes my<br/>\n&gt; blood curl!

Mine is an only child - but very self-sufficient.  Your daughters have each other - but do they get along well together?  Happily, I have the kind of job where my son and I can check in with each other several times a day (and often, a few times an hour!).  I always know what&#39;s going on.  I love the calls that start with &quot;Mom!  guess what I just found out!&quot;...  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be done - and I admit, it was very rough on us both at first - but, it&#39;s been like this for over a year now - and he&#39;s just blossoming.  And it&#39;s like a party most nights when I get home!  We celebrate the time together and talk about everything that&#39;s gone on - and what&#39;s on the plate for the next day... Weekends become our mini-vacations as we go out and explore things - and he picks up a new interest that will spark even more of those phone calls I love the next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck! and Take care,<br/>\n<br/>\nLari<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Amy Childs &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amyc@...\">amyc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: May 26, 2004 7:33 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] single working unschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello there, you very cool group of smart and inspiring unschoolers, you-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been &quot;lurking&quot; (that sounds so sordid) on this list for a while (as<br/>\nwisely instructed by the guidelines), and although it is a little<br/>\noverwhelming to follow all the threads and stay on top of the volume, it has<br/>\nbeen a breath of fresh air to have my inbox so full of your thoughts on so<br/>\nmany topics.
