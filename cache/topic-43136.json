We encourage them not to do something just<br/>\nbecause they think they have to.   Heck, on Election Day our local poll had<br/>\na separate place for kids to vote. The girls and I have had many discussions<br/>\non the election process and about the candidate&#39;s views on particular<br/>\nissues.   Well, my youngest daughter was all in to wanting to vote.  But my<br/>\noldest daughter (12) didn&#39;t want any part of it.  I told her it was<br/>\ncertainly her decision that she did not have too if she didn&#39;t want to.  The<br/>\nonly question I asked was &quot;why?&quot;  She couldn&#39;t give me an answer.  But that<br/>\nis o.k.  My mother about had a cow when she heard my dd didn&#39;t vote.  I<br/>\nquickly told her not to say one word to her about it.  I explained why she<br/>\nhad every right not to and reminded her we live in the &quot;land of the free&quot;.<br/>\nMy dh and I don&#39;t say much about how we homeschool so we don&#39;t get any flack<br/>\nfrom our faith community.
