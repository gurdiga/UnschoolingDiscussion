He never plays loud music or <br/>\n&gt;throws raucous parties. He doesn&#39;t gossip over the fence, just smiles <br/>\n&gt;politely and offers you some tomatoes. His lawn is cared-for, his house is <br/>\n&gt;neat as a pin and you get the feeling he doesn&#39;t always lock his front <br/>\n&gt;door. He wears Dockers. You hardly know he&#39;s there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And then one day you discover that he has pot in his basement, spends his <br/>\n&gt;weekends at peace marches and that guy you&#39;ve seen mowing the yard is his <br/>\n&gt;spouse.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Allow me to introduce Canada.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Canadians are so quiet that you may have forgotten they&#39;re up there, <br/>\n&gt;but they&#39;ve been busy doing some surprising things. It&#39;s like discovering <br/>\n&gt;that the mice you are dimly aware of in your attic have been building an <br/>\n&gt;espresso machine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Did you realize, for example, that our reliable little tag-along brother <br/>\n&gt;never joined the Coalition of the Willing? Canada wasn&#39;t willing, as it <br/>\n&gt;turns out, to join the fun in Iraq. I can only assume American diner menus <br/>\n&gt;weren&#39;t angrily changed to include &quot;freedom bacon,&quot; because nobody here <br/>\n&gt;eats the stuff anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And then there&#39;s the wild drug situation: Canadian doctors are authorized <br/>\n&gt;to dispense medical marijuana. Parliament is considering legislation that <br/>\n&gt;would not exactly legalize marijuana possession, as you may have heard, <br/>\n&gt;but would reduce the penalty for possession of under 15 grams to a fine, <br/>\n&gt;like a speeding ticket. This is to allow law enforcement to concentrate <br/>\n&gt;resources on traffickers; if your garden is full of wasps, it&#39;s smarter to <br/>\n&gt;go for the nest rather than trying to swat every individual bug. Or, in <br/>\n&gt;the United States, bong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, here&#39;s the part that I, as an American, can&#39;t understand. These poor <br/>\n&gt;benighted pinkos are doing everything wrong. They have a drug problem: <br/>\n&gt;Marijuana offenses have doubled since 1991. And Canada has strict gun <br/>\n&gt;control laws, which means that the criminals must all be heavily armed, <br/>\n&gt;the law-abiding civilians helpless and the government on the verge of a <br/>\n&gt;massive confiscation campaign. (The laws have been in place since the <br/>\n&gt;&#39;70s, but I&#39;m sure the government will get around to the confiscation <br/>\n&gt;eventually.) They don&#39;t even have a death penalty!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And yet ... nationally, overall crime in Canada has been declining since <br/>\n&gt;1991. Violent crimes fell 13 percent in 2002. Of course, there are still <br/>\n&gt;crimes committed with guns -- brought in from the United States, which has <br/>\n&gt;become the major illegal weapons supplier for all of North America -- but <br/>\n&gt;my theory is that the surge in pot-smoking has rendered most criminals too <br/>\n&gt;relaxed to commit violent crimes. They&#39;re probably more focused on <br/>\n&gt;shoplifting boxes of Ho-Hos from convenience stores.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And then there&#39;s the most reckless move of all: Just last month, Canada <br/>\n&gt;decided to allow and recognize same-sex marriages. Merciful moose, what <br/>\n&gt;can they be thinking? Will there be married Mounties (they always get <br/>\n&gt;their man!)? Dudley Do-Right was sweet on Nell, not Mel! We must be the <br/>\n&gt;only ones who really care about families. Not enough to make sure they all <br/>\n&gt;have health insurance, of course, but more than those libertines up north.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This sort of behavior is a clear and present danger to all our stereotypes <br/>\n&gt;about Canada. It&#39;s supposed to be a cold, wholesome country of polite, <br/>\n&gt;beer-drinking hockey players, not founded by freedom-fighters in a bloody <br/>\n&gt;revolution but quietly assembled by loyalists and royalists more <br/>\n&gt;interested in order and good government than liberty and independence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But if we are the rugged individualists, why do we spend so much of our <br/>\n&gt;time trying to get everyone to march in lockstep? And if Canadians are so <br/>\n&gt;reserved and moderate, why are they so progressive about letting people do <br/>\n&gt;what they want to?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Canadians are, as a nation, less religious than we are, according to <br/>\n&gt;polls. As a result, Canada&#39;s government isn&#39;t influenced by large, <br/>\n&gt;well-organized religious groups and thus has more in common with those of <br/>\n&gt;Scandinavia than those of the United States, or, say, Iran.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Canada signed the Kyoto global warming treaty, lets 19-year-olds drink, <br/>\n&gt;has more of its population living in urban areas and accepts more <br/>\n&gt;immigrants per capita than the United States.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;These are all things we&#39;ve been told will wreck our society. But I guess <br/>\n&gt;Canadians are different, because theirs seems oddly sound.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Like teenagers, we fiercely idolize individual freedom but really demand <br/>\n&gt;that everyone be the same. But the Canadians seem more adult -- more <br/>\n&gt;secure. They aren&#39;t afraid of foreigners. They aren&#39;t afraid of <br/>\n&gt;homosexuality. Most of all, they&#39;re not afraid of each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wonder if America will ever be that cool. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: OT?

It wasn&#39;t until years later that I learned they <br/>\n&gt; were gay, not sisters.

When we finally talked about it years later, my mom was very <br/>\n&gt; matter of fact and accepting.
