The movies are a mystery to so many people; I like to<br/>\ntell all the secrets.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for stop-frame animation, you are correct that most camcorders don&#39;t have<br/>\na feature that lets you record one frame at a time.  (Some do, but they<br/>\nusually cost lots more.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I used as a kid was a Super-8 camera (the &quot;camcorder&quot; of the late &#39;60s<br/>\nand early &#39;70s).  You can still get these today at flea markets and on eBay<br/>\n(be sure to get a SUPER 8 camera and not &quot;regular&quot; 8 -- regular 8 film is no<br/>\nlonger made).  Also, ask around: so many people have these cameras around<br/>\nand have no use for them.  Before you buy one, do make sure it can do one<br/>\nframe at a time.  Most of them can, but some lame ones were made with very<br/>\nfew features.  You should be able to purchase one for $15 - $20, regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d also need a projector to watch the results of your handiwork.  Lots of<br/>\npeople have these in their attics, or again, eBay.  Super-8 film is easily<br/>\navailable, but you&#39;d likely have to mail-order it in and ship it out for<br/>\ndeveloping (email me if you can&#39;t find places online).  But I think this is<br/>\npart of the fun -- to get your film back 3 weeks later, so excited about<br/>\nwhat it&#39;s going to look like!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process is simple, if tedious.  You stick the camera on a tripod or<br/>\nother firm surface.  You put your scene in front of the camera, usually on a<br/>\ntable.  Look through the lens and focus for the scene.  (You may want to<br/>\nturn bright lights on to help the camera focus.)  When you&#39;re all set up,<br/>\nyou click the &quot;shutter&quot; so that the camera records ONE lonely frame.  (Two<br/>\nis okay too.)  Then, you move your scene a little bit: the clay man moves<br/>\nhis arm half-an-inch, maybe.  Or the lego car moves a similar amount.  It&#39;s<br/>\nfun to move a couple of elements each time, and to know where all this<br/>\naction is heading -- otherwise, it&#39;s hard to know when you&#39;re finished.<br/>\nTake another frame or two.  Move your elements a little more.  Take a frame.<br/>\nMove the elements.  Take a frame.<br/>\n<br/>\nBear in mind that film moves at 24 frames per second (though some super-8 is<br/>\n18 frames per second).  At 24 fps, one minute of finished film takes 1440<br/>\nframes!  That said, most of my animations from childhood are less than 10<br/>\nseconds long and they are still pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nRegan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: film making<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regan, <br/>\n&gt; You are a positive wealth of information, thank you!!<br/>\n&gt; I have been fascinated with the stop frame type of film work for some time,<br/>\n&gt; but assumed you need a special camera as my camcorder isn&#39;t capable of doing<br/>\n&gt; that.

I think the material would be easier to<br/>\nabsorb this way, with lots of pictures of people behind the camera and<br/>\nbuilding models.

Or you could end up meeting local filmmakers who<br/>\nwould let you visit the set of their next project.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what age your kids are, but some fun film-related projects are:<br/>\n<br/>\n*  making scripted videos, using real people or dolls<br/>\n*  making stop-frame animation (with clay or legos)<br/>\n*  making nonsense or found-footage videos (editing bits from tv + movies)<br/>\n*  writing new scripts for a favorite tv show<br/>\n*  documenting small events like dinnertime, a party, a wedding<br/>\n*  videotaping a pet + later adding &quot;voiceover&quot; of what the pet is thinking<br/>\n*  make a comic-book movie by video-ing each frame for a little while +<br/>\nreading the text<br/>\n<br/>\nOlder kids who are interested in filmmaking can learn a lot from still<br/>\nphotography, reading fiction (or reading fiction and then seeing the movie<br/>\nit was made into), a video camera (doesn&#39;t have to be fancy; a $10 one from<br/>\n1987 that works is just fine -- ask around, because lots of people upgrade<br/>\nand have no use for their older models), and any computer editing programs<br/>\nthey can get their hands on [but you CAN edit with two VCRs, or one camera<br/>\nand one VCR.] Storytelling is storytelling, though the tools may change.<br/>\n<br/>\nFilmmaking is one career where you find lots and lots of people with<br/>\nnontraditional and no-college backgrounds.  Another interesting aspect of<br/>\nthe field is that it also features many other jobs that some people aren&#39;t<br/>\naware of: a film set requires hairdressers and medics and teachers and<br/>\nphysical trainers and language experts and architects and historians and<br/>\nmusicians/composers... which is good to know for anyone who thinks film<br/>\nmight be fun, but doesn&#39;t have the personality of a director, actor, or<br/>\nproducer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nRegan<br/>\n<br/>\n(And I have worked on an Alan Rickman movie -- a creepy, no-budget movie<br/>\ncalled &quot;Dark Harbor&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: film making<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the advice Regan...any books that are a simple overview, not too<br/>\n&gt; technical for young kids?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m saving your email addy in case they do stay interested.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ren </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"film making","postDate":"1041956573","msgId":53533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1LjY5MmZmNTguMmI0YzU4ZGRAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53516,"nextInTopic":53553,"prevInTime":53532,"nextInTime":53534,"topicId":53200,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the link Cheryl!
