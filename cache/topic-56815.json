It might have been what changed my <br/>\nview of words---whether they are bad and all. They&#39;re just words. My roommate <br/>\nlived on the Caloosahatchie River. We joked that Caloosahatchie could just <br/>\nhave easily have been decided by the English-speaking-world to be the word <br/>\nfor &quot;shit&quot;. Why did Shit get to be shit? So we started using Caloosahatchie <br/>\ninstead of shit. Or Caloo for short. We changed a lot of words that night, <br/>\nbut Caloo is the only one I remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also talked about folks&#39; reactions to words and how anger/meanness could <br/>\nbe the reason for most &quot;definitions&quot;.

As someone said earlier---look what <br/>\njust happened here. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd conference attendees will never forget &quot;LOWING&quot;! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone&#39;s Granny can say something---or a two year old!---and we can&#39;t help <br/>\nbut snigger. What is it that makes the same wods coming out of an adult&#39;s <br/>\nmouth NOT funny?<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO love words---how they got here, where they&#39;re going. The word pregnant <br/>\nwas banned on TV for YEARS. Now we have gay Will trying to impregnate Grace. <br/>\nGo figure! The evolution of words is fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho KNOWS what will be the &quot;four-letter&quot; words 50-100 years from now. SO cool <br/>\nto speculate.
