It is actually easier<br/>\non your back than carrying the baby because your body is in a more natural<br/>\nposture.  Much like the &quot;papooses&quot; where you carry a child on your back for<br/>\nhiking or lots of walking.  Seems it would hurt your back but it does not.<br/>\n(I used a papoose a lot too, walking for exercise & even at the mall, one on<br/>\nmy back, one in the stroller).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if anyone has suggested it or not, but I would highly recommend<br/>\nyou read Dr. William Sears Baby Book....I called it my baby bible when my<br/>\nfirst was born.  It has SO MUCH good info, about virtually anything from how<br/>\nto wear a sling to how much tylenol to give.  I think Dr. Sears must be the<br/>\n&quot;father of attachment parenting&quot;  as he seems to be the foremost authority.<br/>\nHe has lots of other books too, but the Baby Book might be one you invest in<br/>\nto keep at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with it all....sometimes it is overwhelming but you&#39;ll be<br/>\nsurprised how well you handle it IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jennifer VanLaanen-Smit","from":"Jennifer VanLaanen-Smit &lt;jvanlaanen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kprlsgwidWqYfSQGOF0DEHhaP0MmAiTx3-wiFvC93lcI6Aa1eR6cTriVq5dR2-d6KbuhRQRaaYMQj2tR_uM7xjlTpF4ONjIuUwxGiO0dpmzODMfFYyS5-Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"slings","postDate":"-62152609509","msgId":9473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjIwMDIxNDUyLjIwMTAzLnFtYWlsQHd3dzByLm5ldGFkZHJlc3MudXNhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":9426,"nextInTopic":9476,"prevInTime":9472,"nextInTime":9474,"topicId":3648,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just began to get this list and wanted to say that I am enjoying it.
