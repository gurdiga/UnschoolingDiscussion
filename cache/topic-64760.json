One of our little frogs died and we don&#39;t want the rest of them to. Figure maybe natural food will give them a better chance. <br/>\n<br/>\nSierra watched Hansel and Gretal with Howie Mandel in it. Cute from the parts I saw. Alyssa has watched the video&#39;s Dora the Explorer, Scoobie Doo and Wizard of Oz. I think Scooby at Vampire Rock was on twice today. I don&#39;t think she saw any of them all the way through. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had bacon for lunch. The kids played with playdough and Joseph volunteered to help clean up the whole mess when they were done. Joseph has been drawing and him and Sierra went outside to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlyssa fell asleep in her room. Turned the light off, closed the door and went to bed! Now she&#39;s up and Joseph and Sierra chased me out of there because they wanted privacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTara isn&#39;t home from work yet. Boyfriend picked her up and who knows when she&#39;ll be home.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe wanted to go to Dairy Queen for ice cream. He wants to go now. I said the kids haven&#39;t eaten yet. He told me they can have ice cream for dinner.  More specificially, Palm Sunday ice cream!!! We&#39;ll be leaving after I eat some dinner food.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64646,"nextTopicId":64764}}
