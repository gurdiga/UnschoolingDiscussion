How can someone be <br/>\nunhelpful when he/she expresses or responds to an idea and gives reasons (for <br/>\nor against). I think some here are attempting to sensor valid opinions. <br/>\nCensorship is the tool of the fearful. Are some here perhaps afraid of the <br/>\nwrath of powerful organizations such as the NEA. The concept of Unschooling <br/>\nIS the natural opposite of school. Perhaps some feel that if we openly <br/>\ncriticize schools and it&#39;s supporters such as the government, NEA, and PTO, <br/>\nthat the unschoolers way of life might be regulated out of existence.
