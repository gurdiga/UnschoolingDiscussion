She goes into the bathroom, and closed the door, but<br/>\nstill answers the questions that are whined her way. She comes out makes<br/>\nbreakfast, be it eggs, soup, or nachos. She then starts a load of laundry,<br/>\npicks up a toy, heads to the living room to read. Sits down, opens her book,<br/>\ncloses her book, gets up goes into the kitchen, gives seconds, glasses of<br/>\njuice and milk, and then starts the dishes. She goes back into the living<br/>\nroom to help one of the children find a shoe, and then starts cleaning out<br/>\nunder the sofa. The laundry is done, so she hangs the laundry up. She picks<br/>\nup the breakfast leftovers, lets the dog in, feeds all the pets, and then<br/>\nfinishes the dishes. She eats the leftovers, and runs to catch the glass<br/>\nthat was put tooo close to the edge of the table. She finds the elusive pair<br/>\nof socks, kisses her husband, hands him his keys, and makes sure he has the<br/>\nkeys to HIS car. (Not hers, again) She dresses the lagger, remembers that<br/>\nshe is in her robe, dresses herself, and then grabs books on the way out the<br/>\ndoor. AND this is before any schooling!<br/>\nI AM A SUPER WOMAN<br/>\nI am not the thin, tall, brunette that Major Steve Austin adored.<br/>\nI am in sweats, socks, and sneaks (matching if lucky)<br/>\nI am not in red, white, and blue<br/>\nI am using my fingers to tie my hair up<br/>\nI am not the perfect hair person<br/>\nI am with a wonderful, hard working man<br/>\nI am not with an actor<br/>\nI am a mother and wife, therefore all my days, in someone&#39;s eyes, I am a<br/>\nSUPER WOMAN<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6880,"nextTopicId":6762}}
