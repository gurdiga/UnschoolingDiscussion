It&#39;s just more from the author&#39;s parents about the <br/>\nview of unschooling expressed in the Washington Post article as well <br/>\nas some other points they wanted to make. They gave permission to the <br/>\nperson they were writing to forward it to their list and from there <br/>\nonward.<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************************<br/>\n____________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Thank you for writing with your concerns about the<br/>\n&gt; Washington Post article.<br/>\n&gt; The article was troubling to Christopher and our<br/>\n&gt; family as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The media, as I&#39;m sure you know, doesn&#39;t always<br/>\n&gt; report things correctly. In<br/>\n&gt; fact just last week a newspaper in Britain said that<br/>\n&gt; Christopher wrote his<br/>\n&gt; book while stuck in our &quot;ramshackle farmhouse&quot;<br/>\n&gt; during Montana&#39;s three-month<br/>\n&gt; blizzards. Right.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the first place, Christopher did not do an<br/>\n&gt; interview with the Washington<br/>\n&gt; Post. This was a reprint of an article that ran in<br/>\n&gt; the Jewish World Review.<br/>\n&gt; He did the interview many months ago and was perhaps<br/>\n&gt; not as &quot;on his feet&quot; as<br/>\n&gt; he should have been with his comments. From an<br/>\n&gt; interview that may have<br/>\n&gt; lasted 20 minutes, the reporter chose comments that<br/>\n&gt; fit her purpose.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The use of the word &quot;unschooling&quot; was the<br/>\n&gt; journalist&#39;s choice. Christopher<br/>\n&gt; never mentioned unschooling by name and never would.<br/>\n&gt; It is his firm belief<br/>\n&gt; that the success of homeschooling by any method<br/>\n&gt; depends on the efforts of<br/>\n&gt; the parents or guardians. He espouses no method as<br/>\n&gt; being better than the<br/>\n&gt; other. His comments about families whose children<br/>\n&gt; had little education was<br/>\n&gt; based on true cases from this area. The parents in<br/>\n&gt; these cases were either<br/>\n&gt; too lazy or too caught up in their own endeavors to<br/>\n&gt; give their children the<br/>\n&gt; attention they needed. Not only did the children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; education suffer, but<br/>\n&gt; other aspects of their lives did as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another point in this article was particularly<br/>\n&gt; annoying, the mention of A<br/>\n&gt; Beka. Over the years, Talita cobbled together<br/>\n&gt; material from here and there.<br/>\n&gt; We used many concepts of unschooling, along with<br/>\n&gt; some workbooks, and lots of<br/>\n&gt; hands-on projects designed to help our children<br/>\n&gt; learn by tapping into their<br/>\n&gt; current interests. We used the A Beka materials for<br/>\n&gt; some math and spelling<br/>\n&gt; worksheets because it was easier than writing out<br/>\n&gt; problems by hand. We in no<br/>\n&gt; way support the ideology of A Beka, either their<br/>\n&gt; religious slant or their<br/>\n&gt; curriculum. Unfortunately, Christopher mentioned<br/>\n&gt; their name during the<br/>\n&gt; interview, and the journalist took it further, to<br/>\n&gt; mean that Christopher was<br/>\n&gt; raised with it exclusively. This is far from the<br/>\n&gt; truth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Christopher asked us to tell you that he is a strong<br/>\n&gt; supporter of<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling. He understands that life experience<br/>\n&gt; is the ultimate teacher,<br/>\n&gt; that parents and materials simply facilitate what<br/>\n&gt; must come from within. He<br/>\n&gt; and we send best regards to all homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; families. We chose to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool when it was unpopular and understand the<br/>\n&gt; pressure from family,<br/>\n&gt; friends, and society to school your children<br/>\n&gt; conventionally. We know that<br/>\n&gt; without homeschooling Christopher never would have<br/>\n&gt; written Eragon or be in<br/>\n&gt; the position he is in now. As homeschooling was the<br/>\n&gt; right choice for us, we<br/>\n&gt; also know that for many families public school is<br/>\n&gt; the best or only option.<br/>\n&gt; Our hope is that, whatever educational path is<br/>\n&gt; taken, every child has the<br/>\n&gt; chance to fulfill his potential and follow his<br/>\n&gt; dream.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All the best,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Kenneth and Talita Paolini </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: writer of eragorn-- hidden agenda?
