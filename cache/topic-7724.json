They watch Blues Clues any time they want. They also have some \n    Thomas the Train tapes they watch anytime they want. We are currently \n    learning about space and the solar system. I found a 2 min movie on the net \n    that I downloaded about the sun that they like to watch over and over on the \n    comp. Although they can watch the videos anytime most of their time is spent \n    playing games like dominos, puzzles, and just made up games of their own. \n    They keep themselves and me pretty busy. I make sure that they help pick up \n    the house with me. This is usually stuff they got out but we work in the \n    same room together. They feed and water their dogs and cat, climb trees and \n    explore the woods on our lot. They also like to help me cook. Sometimes they \n    will say, &quot;Mom, lets make a cake.&quot;&nbsp; About two weeks ago they got the \n    food coloring out and suggested a cake. We made a yellow cake, from scratch, \n    and divided the batter into four bowls. Then we added the color and took \n    turns mixing all the bowls. We sworled the colors together when we put the \n    batter in the pans and made it a two layer cake. The icing we used was \n    black, but had been lighted by other colors (I always put my left over icing \n    in a container in the fridge for fun cooking times) It was a beautiful \n    purplish&nbsp;pinkish lavenderish and looked gorgious next to the colors of \n    the cake, red, blue, green and yellow, when we cut it.</tt></font></div>\n    <div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\">&nbsp; Do you have certain lesson plans \n    that you go with? </font></tt></div>\n    <div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\">Our lesson plans are whatever the kids want \n    to do or show and interest in, games, reading, math i.e. counting. \n    </font></tt></div>\n    <div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\">Do any of you enroll your children in \n    classes given by the school districts?</font></tt></div>\n    <div><tt><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"3\"></font></tt>&nbsp;</div>\n    <div><font face=\"Arial\"><tt>I have chosen not to use the school districts at \n    all mainly bacause in other states where this has been done it turns out to \n    be a ploy to get the kids back in the ps.

It is not <br/>\npermission, but tells the school district you will be educating at home.  You <br/>\ndo not need to worry about it at all before age 8.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are testing/evaluation requirements.  They are kept by the parents and <br/>\nare not turned over to the school district.  The theory is that if/when the <br/>\nchild enters public school they will need to know how the child is doing.  <br/>\nIMO it&#39;s hogwash because the school has the &#39;option&#39; of re-testing the child <br/>\nand will ultimately end up placing the child in the grade the school feels is <br/>\nappropriate with our without the tests.  So, don&#39;t let that throw you.  <br/>\nAssessments can be done or tests can be taken.  (or ignored, if you&#39;re so <br/>\ninclined)<br/>\n<br/>\nA teaching parent is supposed to take a &#39;how to homeschool&#39; class or have a <br/>\ncertain amount of college in order to teach at home.  Or a certificated <br/>\nteacher can oversee the education.  I don&#39;t worry about it because DH and I <br/>\nboth have sufficient college hours to check that box.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the basics...for more details on specific laws go to  &lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/&quot;\">http://www.nhen.org/&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: Welcome To the National Home <br/>\nEducation Network&lt;/A&gt;  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/)\">http://www.nhen.org/)</a>  Go to the legslative/legal <br/>\npage and it lists resources for all states.  They work hard to be accurate. <br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, many people never &#39;bother&#39; filling out letters of intent for various <br/>\nreasons ranging from &#39;it&#39;s not the gov&#39;t&#39;s business&#39; to &#39;I never get around <br/>\nto it&#39;.  There is potential for truancy issues which can bring a fine of <br/>\n$25/day.  It is potential and generally not a real threat, at this point.  <br/>\nObviously you&#39;ll have to decide how you feel about it for your family.  I <br/>\nonly want to point it out so you know it&#39;s out there.  Again, no worry before <br/>\nage 8!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for typical day.  In our home there is no such thing.  I find I like it <br/>\nthat way.  I have FMS, which often leaves me in pain, exhausted and weak.  On <br/>\nthose days we don&#39;t &#39;do&#39; much.  On good days we &#39;do&#39; more.  I have had times <br/>\nof feeling really guilty because I worried we weren&#39;t covering the basics <br/>\nwell enough (read not enough textbook or work book work for math or <br/>\nspelling).  I&#39;m learning that we can&#39;t help but cover that material in our <br/>\nday to day living!  Seemingly out of the blue DS will come and tell me all <br/>\nabout how multiplication works or some other discovery he&#39;s just made on his <br/>\nown.   At that point, I ask questions to help me understand what he&#39;s sharing <br/>\nand check to see if he&#39;s on the right track...also to figure out how in the <br/>\nworld that subject even came up!  LOL  Then I can <br/>\ndirect/correct/share/support as needed while he figures it out.  It amazes me <br/>\nwhat he comes up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS (11 yr old) reads a LOT.  Our family loves to read.  Somebody is always <br/>\nstarting or finishing a book around here.  We read out loud to each other and <br/>\nsilently.  In fact, one of the benefits of my FMS is that on bad days I have <br/>\nDS read to me.  Gives us a great chance for quality time together, I can help <br/>\nhim out with his pronunciation and understanding of &#39;big&#39; words.  He tends to <br/>\nread at early adult/college level novels.  Doesn&#39;t want to waste his time on <br/>\nkid&#39;s stuff...with the exception of Harry Potter!  (But I read that too.  <br/>\nLove those books.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving him read to me is relaxing to me and gives us a great opportunity to <br/>\ndiscuss what&#39;s happening in the book he&#39;s reading, share thoughts on the <br/>\nworld at large, whatever.  Again, it amazes me the topics we cover on a <br/>\n&#39;typical&#39; reading session!  (one of the best benefits is I KNOW where he is <br/>\nand what he&#39;s doing, while I am relaxing.  The more relaxed I am, the more <br/>\nlikely to gain enough energy to accomplish something else.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned to not worry about it if he doesn&#39;t understand the book the <br/>\nfirst time he wades through it...he&#39;ll pick the same book up later and read <br/>\nit again with greater understanding.  He&#39;s on his 3rd time through the <br/>\nTolkien series.  Each time brings new insights and better understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I see it is if he can read well and understand what he&#39;s reading, he <br/>\ncan find a resource somewhere to learn anything he wants at any time.

Do you have <br/>\n certain lesson plans that you go with?  Also, do any of you enroll your <br/>\n children in classes given by the school districts? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s different for each family.  That&#39;s the good news and the bad!  You get <br/>\nto figure it out for yourself but you have to figure it out for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t use a lesson plan but I did a lot of checking when we started to see <br/>\nwhat my kids would have been doing in school.  The state dept of ed has a <br/>\nlisting called Sunshine Standards on line.  Don&#39;t know what it would be by <br/>\nyou-- each state does it a little different -- but a lot do seem to have some <br/>\nsort of on line info.  And the &quot;What Your X Grader Should Know&quot; series is <br/>\nhelpful to a lot of people too.  At least these and other organized <br/>\napproaches can get you past that first nervous stage of what to do first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it all starts to flow, I think.  We&#39;ve only been at this for about 1 1/2 <br/>\nyears and I love it and just make it up as we go along.  The kids are doing <br/>\nso well that we are just going to keep on doing what we like to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich includes but is not limited to:  outside classes for Tae Kwon Do, piano <br/>\nand dance, online math class, lots of CDs and internet computer time, lots of <br/>\ntrips to the library, a weekly science experiment that we get online, <br/>\nsuggestions from Gramma (very supportive now that she has started <br/>\nvolunteering in a local ps 1st grade class!), etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also constantly checking to see if something better has come along in <br/>\nour area.  No harm in checking, I say.  So far, nothing has.  The latest was <br/>\na charter school but they don&#39;t seem to be really ready for any sort of <br/>\npart-time hs/ps arrangement and that&#39;s what we would want to do, if at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, I don&#39;t have the option of classes at the local ps.  Some people are <br/>\nopposed to this sort of arrangement all together.  I fall into the &quot;whatever <br/>\nworks&quot; category and just wish I even had the choice at this point but don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Do you have to hand in a <br/>\n letter of intent thru your school district or have you just done this on <br/>\nyour <br/>\n own?  I have been asked by several people.......&quot;Can&#39;t you be thrown in jail <br/>\n for educating your child at home?&quot;   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Florida so, yes, we have to send in a letter of intent when we <br/>\nstart hsing.  Then annual evaluations (testing or portfiolio review) after <br/>\nthat.  And we have to keep a log and portfolio (nothing too formal tho if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to) as we go along.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut these things differ greatly from state to state.  You might want to check <br/>\nthe state law for your state at:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.nhen.org<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a relatively new online hsers networking organization.  They have <br/>\nlots of good info.  A page of info for new hsers, for instance.  And they are <br/>\nworking on putting up more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are lots of other resources on line and in the library to give you <br/>\ntips and project and curriculum -- probably too much!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, altho this is not the case in many areas, our local school board was <br/>\nactually helpful in getting us the info about the regulations and what to <br/>\nfile.  So you could check there if that&#39;s comfortable.  But it didn&#39;t sound <br/>\nlike you have a great school situation so maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you can get everything you want and more if you just have lots and <br/>\nlots of time to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and there are local hsing groups in a lot of areas.  The one near us did <br/>\nnot fit our family (we are not Christians and they are) but you may find one <br/>\nnear you that can get you headed in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with everything!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"braunville@aol.com","from":"braunville@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Yz5651U54Op_rcVujBhENC334JIY8IS2LWLJJCJPdEQ1N6j3j5e1RyhbE4uotwa_TUGrxb_8CgnU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to the list","postDate":"964904063","msgId":11600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4LjkyMDNlNTQuMjZiNDllN2ZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11599,"nextInTopic":11603,"prevInTime":11599,"nextInTime":11601,"topicId":7724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/28/2000 11:08:41 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

It is ashame that some (many) teachers are only there to go <br/>\nthrough the routine, and receive a paycheck; sad but true.                      <br/>\n                                                                A typical <br/>\nunschooling day is different for each family-- no two are really alike.  In <br/>\nmy home, my kids are very young-- my oldest will be 6 in Sept.  I have one <br/>\nthat will be 4 in Nov and a 10 mo old, too.  We play a lot of games, and read <br/>\nbooks mostly right now.  My kids have a lot of outdoor play, we are raising <br/>\ntadpoles, have a goldfish pond, and an indoor aquarium.I try to be an <br/>\nencourager when it comes to learning a specific skill, but sometimes I find I <br/>\npush a little, too.    That&#39;s ok, because sometimes a little push is needed.  <br/>\n:)  We are beginning to participate in our local homeschooling events, such <br/>\nas in the annual science and art fair.  My kids are enjoying learning on the <br/>\ncomputer, too.  We do not have a rigid scheduled  day, and usually don&#39;t <br/>\npursue educ. activities until late morning or early after lunch, because <br/>\nmornings are not conducive to those kinds of things at this time in our <br/>\nlives.  If we are having an off day, we may not do much that seems actively <br/>\neducational.  Some days are very busy, and some days are less busy, but it <br/>\nall balances out.   We do not have to turn in lesson plans to anyone  here in <br/>\nInd.  The laws are lenient and easy going here.  Tell your questioners that <br/>\nhomeschooling is legal in all states in the USA.  Have a great Sat., too.  <br/>\n~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"aworthen","from":"&quot;aworthen&quot; &lt;aworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"SExE13KR1LSciYe_7_fl1vf3lc9Swqj8lOdbbKpCnw5Paptuntot-SsLBBtvweu9xwMM224Igq--6h4qXwLvVByCbnURzlBqyQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to the list","postDate":"964896983","msgId":11597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYWYwMWJmZjk4ZSRiMGZjZTgyMCRkM2E0ODAxOEBuZS5tZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwYzcwMWJmZjhmMCRlYmJkZmVjMCQ3Y2FiMTRkMUBjb21wYXE+"},"prevInTopic":11595,"nextInTopic":11599,"prevInTime":11596,"nextInTime":11598,"topicId":7724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Colette, I m Amy unschooling mom of three girls 7, 4, and 2.

I began schooling him at home about 2 years ago when he was<br/>\n&gt; having troubles with his teacher in public school.   We took the<br/>\n&gt; relaxed appraoch to home-schooling then and I have just learned about<br/>\n&gt; Un-schooling and come to find out, that is exactly what I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; doing without knowing it!
