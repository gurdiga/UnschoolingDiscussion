ER, CSI, action/adventure movies, etc....  I think I do tend to shield them from gratuitous sex moreso than violence, though.  With the violence, it is pretty easy to see and understand what is &quot;wrong&quot; or undesirable with it.  The kids can identify a &quot;good guy&quot; and a &quot;bad guy.&quot;  With the sex... it just isn&#39;t that cut and dried.  We tend to fast forward through anything explicit...   I will discuss the relationship between the people with my 9yo... as it relates to our family&#39;s beliefs regarding sex as something for a married couple, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, if a movie is full of violence for violence&#39;s sake, we usually won&#39;t want to watch it.  It needs to be key to the movie&#39;s plot.  Same with the sex and/or language.  We pretty much discuss anything that raises questions from the kids or that we think needs to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\nMama to Emily (12/91), Noah (12/95), Halle (10/98), and Joel (9/00)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2358\">http://www.geocities.com/heartland/2358</a><br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:careermom@...\">careermom@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19081,"nextTopicId":19148}}
