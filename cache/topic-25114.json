As there<br/>\n&gt; is no flat ground here making one side deep and the<br/>\n&gt; other shallow is easy enough.  We want one side to be<br/>\n&gt; so that the toads and frogs and turtles can get out<br/>\n&gt; easily.  I often have to dump the toads and frogs out<br/>\n&gt; of the dog&#39;s water in the morning before the drown.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tadpoles eat algae.  Also water hyacinths help to keep<br/>\n&gt; it down. And baby fish hide in it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Other Sharon, how deep does the water need to be<br/>\n&gt; for water lilies? Our deep side is going to be about 3<br/>\n&gt; feet. It is mostly in shade...can the lilies flourish<br/>\n&gt; in shade?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our little pond is only about 6&#39;X 8&#39;. I can&#39;t dig more<br/>\n&gt; than that!! We plan to have no pumps or filters.  Just<br/>\n&gt; gamboozia, maybe some goldfish (feeder type) our two<br/>\n&gt; little turtles, maybe transplant some crawdads  (plan<br/>\n&gt; to have dirt in the bottom) and minnows, and then<br/>\n&gt; whoever else moves in. We do have plans to plant<br/>\n&gt; plants. Around and in. Anybody have any favorites?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DH tells me I don&#39;t have enough cement. 3 40lb dry<br/>\n&gt; bags. Oh well. DS and I will use this first and see<br/>\n&gt; how far it goes, etc. then get more.  We have plans to<br/>\n&gt; make inlaid stepping stones here and there anyways.<br/>\n&gt; Actually the stepping stones were the original reason<br/>\n&gt; to get the cement mix. I just thought that Roy would<br/>\n&gt; have more enthusasim for a pond.  He does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe we&#39;ll get really ambitious and use the quick<br/>\n&gt; drying kind and make a statue or shrine or something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wonder how hard an arched cement bridge over the brown<br/>\n&gt; water run-off would be? Maybe just big enough for toy<br/>\n&gt; trucks. Probably the end result will be that our yard<br/>\n&gt; will look like archaeological ruins.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sharon...in NE FL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  On Mon, 10 Sep 2001 13:33:19 -0400 Ann<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mumsienc@...\">mumsienc@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve wanted to do a pond for a long time, but can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keep up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with the gardens I have now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; LOL<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ann<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ann,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve found the water garden to be much less work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than a regular garden.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another benefit to it is that the bunnies can&#39;t eat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the water lilies like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the way they love to eat everything else they can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get at.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sharon<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!<br/>\nMessenger<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://im.yahoo.com\">http://im.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
