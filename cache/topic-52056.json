The two of them got <br/>\nout and went missing back in September.  After 4 days, Ladybug managed to <br/>\nflag down my husband on the road late one night.  We never heard or saw from <br/>\nPercy again.  I presumed and felt strongly that she was dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today we&#39;re driving a direction on our road we don&#39;t normally go, and who <br/>\nis standing in the road but Percy!  I stopped the car and called her name, <br/>\nand she took off running.  She ran about 100 yards to her new driveway, up <br/>\nthe driveway and around back.  I hopped out of the car in the driveway, and <br/>\ntrotted to the back to find her standing on a deck chair, barking at me.  As <br/>\nsoon as she got a whiff of me she started wagging all over and jumping and <br/>\ndoing her happy dance!  :&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy this time tears were streaming down my face, and I rang the doorbell.  A <br/>\nman came out and he said they had been feeding her since she showed up, and <br/>\nthat she was a sweet dog and that his wife was going to be heartbroken.   :(  <br/>\nWe talked a little about who she was and where she&#39;d come from and about her <br/>\ncataracts and her sneezing and diminished sense of smell (age or sinus <br/>\npolyps, no one knows).  He knew from our conversation that I wasn&#39;t pulling <br/>\nhis leg.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s healthy and slimmed down and happy to be home!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI bought the couple some chocolate today.
