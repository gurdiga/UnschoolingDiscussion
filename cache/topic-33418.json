She thought it was a good idea because<br/>\nshe wanted to try college and also wanted to be able<br/>\nto show on paper that she had learned something.  We<br/>\nstill did other things together, and she decided when<br/>\nand how much to study.  I taped the PBS GED programs<br/>\nfor her.  At sixteen she started her first job.  At<br/>\nseventeen she was allowed to take GED pre-tests at the<br/>\nlocal high school.  After seeing her scores, the<br/>\nteacher advised her to just take the test instead of<br/>\nspending any time in class.  At eighteen she passed<br/>\nher GED, took the ACT, then placement tests at the<br/>\ncommunity college, then attended college classes for<br/>\ntwo years while still working part- to full-time.  Not<br/>\ntransferring to the university was her choice.  She&#39;s<br/>\nworked full-time steadily since college and now is 23,<br/>\nwith a great variety of interests and activities in<br/>\nher life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a specific goal in mind, the related volunteer<br/>\nwork, and relationships with people in her chosen<br/>\nfield, your daughter will probably want to do what&#39;s<br/>\nneeded.  My younger girl even asks for new workbooks,<br/>\netc, for her least favorite subjects so she&#39;ll know<br/>\nshe&#39;s maintaining a useful body of knowledge and<br/>\nskill.  I don&#39;t think it matters so much what<br/>\nresources you use, if you&#39;re both comfortable.  I<br/>\npersonally feel regimentation is unhealthy, and that<br/>\nit&#39;s different from being disciplined or<br/>\nself-disciplined.  I know it&#39;s very easy for my<br/>\ndaughters and for myself to learn something at the<br/>\ntime it&#39;s interesting or related to something<br/>\ninteresting and when the time-frame doesn&#39;t matter. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a great deal more to novels and movies, for<br/>\nexample, than just a story line, and they&#39;ve led us in<br/>\na lot of fascinating directions academically.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
