While foreign language <br/>\n(Spanish, French, Japanese, etc.) courses are offered online, there <br/>\nare hardly any high quality courses offered for free.  On the other <br/>\nhand, virtually all Esperanto resources online are free, including <br/>\ncomplete introductory courses, as well as some advanced courses, <br/>\ndictionaries, news and radio broadcasts, literature (novels, short <br/>\nstories, poetry), music, travel opportunities through the hospitality <br/>\nservice &#39;Pasposta Servo&#39;, etc.  Check out the following list of the <br/>\nmost useful links:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/ljecak\">http://www.geocities.com/ljecak</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is now a new and extraordinary web site for learning Esperanto, <br/>\nas always, for free.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lernu.net/lernu.php?lingvo=en\">http://www.lernu.net/lernu.php?lingvo=en</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt offers three basic mini-courses equivalent to about a year&#39;s worth <br/>\nof college studies.
