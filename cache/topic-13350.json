What a<br/>\nresponse to my question! Very interesting what you&#39;all have to say - and<br/>\nso informative to hear of your experiences. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to add that in my reading, I have learned that with the<br/>\nchicken pox vaccine, you only get partial immunity for a few years (10,<br/>\nI think it was) - but if you get the disease naturally, you have<br/>\ncomplete lifetime immunity. And yes, the older you are when you get the<br/>\npox, the worse it is... can be deadly in some cases!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got it when I was in 2nd grade, I remember it well but it was no huge<br/>\ndeal. I was miserably itchy for a week, then took an additional week off<br/>\nschool just to make sure. I worry about my boyfriend though, he&#39;s never<br/>\nhad it and he&#39;s 29... we might decide to get HIM vaccinated, but I&#39;d<br/>\nrather my daughter get the pox naturally, and have lifetime immunity. <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to reading...<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13164,"nextTopicId":13351}}
