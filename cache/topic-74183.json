Shalom, Raine<br/>\n<br/>\nPERSPECTIVES <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be.  They  spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family.  When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, &quot;How was the trip?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVery good, Dad!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Did you see how poor people can be?&quot; the father asked.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah!&quot;  &quot;And what did you learn?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe son answered, &quot;I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four.  We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden, they have a creek that has no end.  We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars.  Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHis son added, &quot;Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it true that it all depends on the way you look at things?  If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you&#39;ve got everything!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t buy any of these things.  You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, provisions for the future, etc., but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74182,"nextTopicId":74167}}
