We are in Pataskala, southeast or so of <br/>\nJohnstown, a 10 minute drive.  We went when the local school sponsored there <br/>\nmonthly skate, when a homeschooling group had a skate, when a cousin had a <br/>\nbirthday party there. We even went a few weeks ago on a sunday afternoon, <br/>\nthey have open skate. Anyhoo, Pataskala is 15 miles west of Newark, it is our <br/>\ncounty seat. I am right smack between Newark and Columbus,  I got bored once <br/>\nand used mapquest to see which stores were further, it&#39;s about even. I lived <br/>\nin Newark in 1990, my freshman year at Ohio State I did a summer pre-quarter <br/>\nand my first quarter there. I lived in the apartments behind the campus. I <br/>\ngrew up and graduated in Whitehall(suburb of Cols), and moved back there to <br/>\nstart my family. I have only been away from Whitehall and in Pataskala about <br/>\n2 years.
