Rob was in almost fulltime. Levi was in  for lack of <br/>\nemotional and impulse control. Ashton was getting evaluated for her <br/>\nlearning disabilities when I said enough. <br/>\nI have only been unschooling since this fall. I did school at home, <br/>\nwith frustration for all. <br/>\nHere is my perspective.. My kids are unique. They are all unique. I <br/>\nwant them to be the best at whatever they enjoy. RIGHT now the boys <br/>\nare into Diablo. And clay. Ashton is into writing. Everyones <br/>\nconfidence is growing every day.. Ashton asks how to spell the as <br/>\nshe writes. But reads the guide on the tv fluently. ROB played <br/>\nCranium today. He wanted to read every card with me.. ALthough his <br/>\nreading is very jumbled and dislexic. He played the game as well as <br/>\nany of us. Levi was up until 1.30 am watching a movie and had a <br/>\nsmall meltdown today.. He needed to snuggle for a bit on the couch <br/>\nand have his back tickled. I am going with the full confidence that <br/>\nas they get to not worry about what they do not possess they will <br/>\nget what they need. <br/>\nWhen I see my kids I see their birthparents many times. Birthparents <br/>\nthat if they had experience kindness would not be so hurt and <br/>\ndamaged. My kids are amazing people they do not need to be fluent <br/>\nreaders or math geniuses they need to be secure and they need to <br/>\nhave joy and live their lives.<br/>\nI had a woman ask if Olivia my three year old was retarded.. Very <br/>\nfunny. Olivia is delayed about nine months.

School is a horrible place for children who do not <br/>\nfit the social and academic norms.  As daunting as dealing with a <br/>\nspecial needs child on a 24/7 basis may seem, if they go to school, <br/>\nthe time you spend with them outside of school is going to be <br/>\nseverely compromised.  The difficulties they have will only <br/>\nintensify, not just magically disappear.   Also, think of the <br/>\nchallanges of dealing with one special needs child.  Special Ed <br/>\nteachers have several students, it&#39;s very rarely a one on one <br/>\nsituation, and if it is, it is for only a breif part of the day.  <br/>\nImagine dealing with a roomful of children who all have differing, <br/>\nintense needs.. not a good situation.
