I am the mother of 3,<br/>\ntwo of which homeschool, or should I say unschool.  In response to your<br/>\nmigraine questions, I think I can help.  I have been a migraine sufferer<br/>\nsince the ripe old age of three.  At least that is what I have been<br/>\ntold.  I too am a daily migraine sufferer and have finally found<br/>\nrelief.  I have tried all the conventional antidotes ex- ergotomines,<br/>\nimitrex, and so on.  I finally found a nuerologist who really knows his<br/>\nmeds.  He has me taking a drug called Sibelium Capsules 5mg. one daily<br/>\n(I take it before bed) and it  does the trick. Technically it is known<br/>\nas a calcium channel blocker.  Now for the bad news.  This med is only<br/>\navailable out of the country.  I get it in Mexico.  It is made by<br/>\nJanssen Pharmacuetical, which is a large reputable drug company, in case<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t know.  Also, I should mention that my dad is a physician and<br/>\nif there was any risk with this drug I would not be taking it.  It seems<br/>\nthe FDA just hasn&#39;t approved it for sales in the U.S. yet.  In Mexico,<br/>\nit is sold over the counter, like most other drugs are there, so it is<br/>\nno problem getting it  if you have a connection.  Don&#39;t know where you<br/>\nare located, but Canada probably has it too.  I know of other people who<br/>\nare also taking this and it has made the world of difference in their<br/>\nlives.  Mind you I still get the occasional migraines (in fact I woke<br/>\nwith one this morning) but with 3 excedrin, a dark room, and pressure on<br/>\nmy head I can usually get over it within a hour.  I would really<br/>\nquestion a dr. who wants to put you on antideppresants for migraine.<br/>\nJust my $.02.  Didn&#39;t mean to go on so long but I do know what you are<br/>\ngoing through and wish you all the best.  Shelley<br/>\nA.
