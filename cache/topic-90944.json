Then tell him/her to go read some history.

Especially since I hardly ever post.<br/>\n First, I love unschooling and am so happy to be raising my children this <br/>\nway. But as an unschooling mom I personally don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m the one educating <br/>\nmy children. I didn&#39;t teach my son (8) to add, subtract, multipy or how <br/>\npercentages work. He figured it out on his own. I never sat down to teach him to <br/>\nread. But he reads most words and sounds out the ones he douesn&#39;t know. I don&#39;t <br/>\nteach him about snakes or lizards or the solar system or politicsor history. <br/>\nHe watches television , both educational and not supposed to be educational <br/>\nprograms, movies, goes to museums, and litens and participates in conversations <br/>\nabout various subjects. My daughter (14) has learned much in the same way. They <br/>\nare responsible for their own education as far as I&#39;m concerned. I went to <br/>\npublic school and I still feel as though most of my learning was on my own. <br/>\nSecond, as much as I love unschooling and am excited to see other people home <br/>\nwith their kids too, it&#39;s not for every family and situation. My home was no <br/>\nplace to be during my childhood and I&#39;m so glad I had a place to go.

Im new to this group and have been reading your posts over the<br/>\nlast week.  My name is Rheta.  I have 2 dd Isabel and Viven, 5 yo and 2<br/>\n½ yo respectively.  My wonderful dh of 10 years, Mark, and our 3 cats<br/>\n(cant forget them!).  We decided to Homeschool from the time I was pg<br/>\nwith Isabel and after reading as much as I could, came across the term<br/>\nunschooling and started to read up on it.  I cant say I know it all and<br/>\nIve been known to get uptight when a friends child begins to do<br/>\nsomething I think my dd should know;  learning how to back off and<br/>\nfollow her interests has been an experience in itself.  A good one<br/>\nthough.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI was posed a question today that I wasnt sure how to answer and<br/>\nfigured if anyone could help me with this, it would be all of you.

Does anyone know<br/>\nif there were public schools that far back.  Ive read that the public<br/>\nschool system was not in place until just the past 100 years or so.  As<br/>\nI said, I do not know it all.  I figure I can research all of this in my<br/>\nspare time (LOL) or I can ask those of you who already know how to<br/>\ncounter this statement.  I feel I should be able to answer this but seem<br/>\nto have drawn a blank.  Any help would be appreciated.
