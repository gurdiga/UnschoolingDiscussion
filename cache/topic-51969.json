It&#39;s<br/>\ncalled &quot;Atanarjuat, The Fast Runner&quot; and is in Inuktitut, subtitled in<br/>\nEnglish and runs about three hours.  I have not (to my dismay) seen it yet,<br/>\nbut know folks who have liked it very much.  It is based on an Inuit legend<br/>\nand won Canadian film awards, plus the Cannes Palme d&#39;or for Best First<br/>\nFeature Film.  It&#39;s available in DVD, but not sure about VHS.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can Google it, too.
