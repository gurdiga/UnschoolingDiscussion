In fact, it seems to indicate that Jews regard their <br/>\ncommentary as authorative as they do their scriptures, which <br/>\nChristians do not (generalizing here for simplicity).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole web site warns against simplistic comparisons of the <br/>\nChristian OT and the Jewish scripture, which I guess was your point.  <br/>\nSo I learned something new from this research.  Here are the first <br/>\nand last paragraphs:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;STILL MORE fundamental is the partiality of vision that allows the <br/>\nstatement&#39;s authors to declare that both faiths &quot;seek authority from <br/>\nthe same book,&quot; known to Jews as the &quot;Tanakh&quot; (a Hebrew acronym for <br/>\nthe three sections of the Jewish Bible) and to Christians as the &quot;Old <br/>\nTestament.&quot; This awkward gloss on how the two traditions refer to <br/>\nthe &quot;same book&quot; already points to the problem. Christians do not <br/>\nrefer to the Old Testament alone as the Bible, and Jews, for their <br/>\npart, do not consider the New Testament to be biblical in any way.&quot;<br/>\n........<br/>\n&quot;In their paragraph about the Bible, the authors of Dabru Emet also <br/>\npassed up an opportunity to correct one of the most common Christian <br/>\nmisconceptions about Judaism--namely, that the Bible is its sole <br/>\nauthority. They could have done so by pointing to the centrality of <br/>\nthe oral Torah, that is, the Mishnah and subsequent rabbinic <br/>\nteaching. Did they refrain out of the (perhaps unconscious) <br/>\nrecognition that this would have profoundly undermined their <br/>\nsimplistic claim that the two communities appeal to &quot;the same book&quot;?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Ebbers<br/>\nAge 51, still learning</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Evolution of the Bible (was re: Evolution)","postDate":"1035054079","msgId":46890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMy4xNjQ3MWRmMy4yYWUzMDVmZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46897,"prevInTime":46889,"nextInTime":46891,"topicId":46890,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/16/02 2:58:16 PM, mikeebb@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2124471421\">In a message dated 10/16/02 2:58:16 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mikeebb@...\">mikeebb@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Jews and Christians share the same scriptures: the <br/>\nOld Testament, as Rachel Ann mentioned, was passed intact from Jews <br/>\nto Christians.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Intact&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Torah is only the first five books of the Protestant Old Testament.  <br/>\nCatholics have extra books which Protestants decided to dump at some point.  <br/>\nWhen was it &quot;intact&quot;?
