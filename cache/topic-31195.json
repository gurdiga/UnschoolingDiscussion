A special edition of the 1984<br/>\nclassic, The Deluxe Transitive Vampire is populated by a wickedly decadent<br/>\ncast of gargoyles, mastodons, murderous debutantes, and, yes, vampires (both<br/>\ntransitive and otherwise), who cavort and consort in order to illustrate<br/>\nbasic principles of grammar. The sentences are intoxicating--&quot;How he loved<br/>\nto dangle his participles, brush his forelock off his forehead with his<br/>\nforeleg, and gaze into the aqueous depths&quot;--but the rules and their<br/>\nexplanations are as sound as any you might find in Strunk and White.<br/>\nOutlining the building blocks of the English language, from parts of speech<br/>\nto phrases and clauses, The Deluxe Transitive Vampire goes on to exorcise<br/>\nsuch grammatical demons as passive voice, fragments, comma splices, and<br/>\nrun-on sentences. At last, a handbook of grammar you will actually want to<br/>\nread. In the words of Gordon&#39;s preface, &quot;Howling, exploding, crackling,<br/>\nflickering with new life-forms, and drunk on fresh blood (some of mine is<br/>\ncertainly missing), this deluxe edition reminds us on every page that words,<br/>\ntoo, have hoofs and wings to transport us far and deep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are *lots* of interesting resources like this for *every* subject.<br/>\nDry, boring textbooks just aren&#39;t necessary.  For kids who like to read,<br/>\nthey can learn what they need to by reading books like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Leslie Moyer</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31205,"nextTopicId":31202}}
