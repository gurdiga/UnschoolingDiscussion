He was<br/>\nsearched 5 times at LAX when he flew home just before Christmas, because<br/>\nhe was a single guy on a one-way ticket (we flew him out on a one-way<br/>\nticket, too, because his mother was dying and we didn&#39;t know when he was<br/>\ngoing to go back but we needed him right away) and had a &quot;funny&quot; last<br/>\nname (Hungarian, not Middle Eastern, but apparently anything &quot;funny&quot; is<br/>\ndangerous).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn one of the last searches, the army reservist was making conversation<br/>\nand asked my brother what he did for a living (the bald head apparently<br/>\nwasn&#39;t enough of a clue). My brother told him, and the guy was kind of<br/>\ntaken-aback and said, &quot;Oh... how&#39;d I do?&quot; My brother told him that he had<br/>\nnot done well at all, and named the training videos he had apparently<br/>\nslept through. Then he named off a few things they had missed - he had a<br/>\nmetal shoe horn that he could have sharpened in seconds; another guy came<br/>\nthrough with a video camera and they didn&#39;t x-ray or check it at all - he<br/>\ncould have removed the insides and stuck anything in there; another guy<br/>\ncame through with a full water bottle and they didn&#39;t check it, it could<br/>\nhave been anything in there... and other stuff.

I answered 20 questions and then another one came <br/>\nover and said it was necessary to ask me more questions. Some of them <br/>\nwere the same and when I said that, they said &#39;just answer the questions. <br/>\nSo I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen they took me to a small alcove that was off to the side and <br/>\nproceeded to check my luggage. They asked me to tell them WHO was in the <br/>\npictures from the wallet, their relationship to me etc. etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my luggage I had carefully wrapped Celentano ravioli and Drake&#39;s <br/>\nYodels for my sister in England. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I sat there and lit up a cigarette they tried to tell me there was no <br/>\nsmoking. I told them they were detaining me they should let me go to a <br/>\nrestaurant or deal with the smoke. So they dealt with the smoke.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of a sudden one of them comes running in shouting in a language I <br/>\ncould not understand and proceeded to make round gestures with his hands. <br/>\nThe woman searching my pocketbook looked up and I said to her it was <br/>\nraviolis. But by then it was too late, they tore apart my wrapping, <br/>\ntossed the dry ice and handed them back to me all dripping and stuff. My <br/>\nfriend and I got sugar rushes from eating Yodels for dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, they told my friend to go and took me down the hall where a <br/>\nwoman officer said she needed to make sure I wasn&#39;t carrying anything. <br/>\nShe made me take off my sneakers and she put a metal detector to them and <br/>\nthen me. Then she frisked me.. it was rather quickly and she was thankful <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t wearing anything that one can really hide something in (ahh, <br/>\nlife before children!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, they walked me to  my seat by an armed guard and I was told <br/>\nnot to move.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other friend had joined me in England the next day and I told her we <br/>\nneeded to switch flights coming back. I said I would rather take a chance <br/>\non the security of other airlines than deal with that again. Somehow, she <br/>\nthought I was exaggerating and she said &#39;don&#39;t worry, this time, I&#39;ll be <br/>\nthere&#39;. She was a therapist and YOU know how they are =)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, on the way back, a watered down scenario of the above happened and <br/>\nshe was complaining like a woman. I said &#39;this is nothing&#39;!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe proceeded to get into a fight with the stewardess when the employee <br/>\ngrabbed her and to put out her cigarette. And she couldn&#39;t believe how we <br/>\nwere singled out (as americans) and treated with such contempt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I left the plane, I held up a homeopathic solution I picked up in <br/>\nGermany and proceeded to tell them that this is the same kind of <br/>\ncontainer that NitroGlycerin is transported in. I explained that they let <br/>\nme hand-check this (no x-ray) and they let me carry it all over the place <br/>\nwhile they were so busy looking for bombs. I told her that no matter what <br/>\nkind of security you *think* you have.. its not going to cover all the <br/>\nbases and still function as a business.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe just looked at me like I had two heads and prolly had no idea what <br/>\nkind of damage 36 vials of Nitro could do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve flown a lot in the past few years and scanning for guns, large <br/>\nknives and explosives are about all you could do.. not unless you put <br/>\neveryone in a straightjacket and feed them IV.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] off topic: airline security issues","postDate":"1009583433","msgId":30358,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMjI4MjM1MC5mQlNOb2lpQzAyNTI3MUBueWNzbXRwMW91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":30357,"nextInTopic":30360,"prevInTime":30357,"nextInTime":30359,"topicId":30353,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The older dd, age 11 went through the metal detector and sounded off the alarm (due to belt buckle, hair accessories). My sister also set the alarm off. Normal procedure is to pat down these individuals, which did occur. But they would NOT let my sister(who is a flight attendent for this airlines) get close to her child during this time. Also, an airline rep was standing between the line of vision of sister and her dd, so my sister asked her to move and she got in a huff about the request. Anyway, just so you all know if you are flying with kids... a pat down isn&#39;t out of the question for your kids no matter how innocent they may be or look.  Also, just heard on NPR tonight that diplomats to NOT have to be searched nor is their carryon luggage. (and yet they&#39;ll pat down a kid). Go figure...<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, the pat-down is done in a decent way... the officer uses the back of his hand and he&#39;s very careful with kids.
