They have lots of food restrictions, limited media exposure (disney is evil tv is evil, coorporate monsters that will make your child materialistic, unimaginative and violent) and rots your brain, waldorfy toys, no plastic toys, earthy crunchy sorts that we have more in common with than mainstream folks, but still different.   Organic foods only, no sugar or hydrogenated whatever.  (don&#39;t eat the baked goods).  Just kidding, some is fine.  But, very restrictive in my opinion.  Probably the same as you experienced.  Kind of waldorfish.  Their kids knit which is neat.  We go to a science class in the park that has a great mix.  The class is this guy that brings neat animals and talks to the kids about nature.  <br/>\nMostly, earthy crunchy attachment parenting types.  So, for the most part we fit in great.

Has anyone else read &quot;The Plug In Drug&quot;? <br/>\n-=- <br/>\n<br/>\nI read it and thought it was nonsense, honestly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf flicker effect and radiation and passivity are serious dangers, jump up <br/>\nand run away from this computer you&#39;re looking at! Kids don&#39;t sit this close to <br/>\nthe TV or stare so closely. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen automobiles were first invented there was professional opinion that <br/>\nhumans couldn&#39;t survive going that fast. Pressure on their faces or some such. <br/>\nGosh, they were wrong. And automobiles, trains and planes are necessary for <br/>\ngetting around the world unless one wants to have a horse or bicycle and never <br/>\nleave the neighborhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children will be in a world with video after I&#39;m dead, and I can&#39;t change <br/>\nthe world. That iS part of our world, and living artificially separate from th<br/>\ne culture and from technology might be the reason some people homeschool, but <br/>\nI WANT my children to live in the world as whole people, not protected or <br/>\nstunted people. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child didn&#39;t have books at home he might be seriously fascinated by them <br/>\nelsewhere. If a child never heard music and heard it elsewhere, it might be <br/>\nseriously more interesting than his mom while he was first listening. The <br/>\nanswer wouldn&#39;t be to stop taking him where books or music were. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra <br/>\n===============================<br/>\nThe last was in reference to someone&#39;s evidence that TV was bad for her child <br/>\nbecause he (who didn&#39;t have TV at home) would become mesmerized when he was <br/>\nwhere a TV was.   <br/>\nI think that just shows he was interested in it and thought it was wonderful. <br/>\n I&#39;ve been mesmerized by things.  Last week it was the instruction manual for <br/>\nmy new rice machine.  When I started reading it, my husband was telling my <br/>\ndaughter stories I had already heard, and I tuned them out.

(Yeah, letting the little Baptist<br/>\nkid in my <br/>\n&gt; shine forth for a second. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent my kid to school because of the extremely negative experiences<br/>\nI had with the unschoolers in my area. This was after six years of<br/>\nbeing a total unschooling groupie, John Holt fanatic, being positive I<br/>\nwould NEVER sent my kid to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I got acquainted with actual unschoolers . . . well, let&#39;s<br/>\njust say that the ones in my area, those I know, anyway, are nothing<br/>\nlike the ones on this list. They seem to be unschooling more for<br/>\npolitical/social reasons than as a way to get close to or nurture<br/>\ntheir kids. They are very controlling about TV, computers, food, guns,<br/>\netc. They talk very stridently about how terrible the larger culture<br/>\nis and how they are protecting their kids by not sending them to<br/>\nschool . . . a lot, imho, like fundie school-at-homers do. A lot of<br/>\nthe kids seem to be genuinely neglected by parents who are more or<br/>\nless just doing their thing (raising goats or protesting wars, not<br/>\nthat there&#39;s anything inherently wrong with either of those<br/>\nactivities) and expecting the kids to join in and making them feel<br/>\nguilty if they&#39;d rather be playing video games with their friends or<br/>\nsomething. Some of the kids have asked repeatedly to go to school and<br/>\ntheir parents guilt trip them over that too but make no attempt to<br/>\nmake their lives at home more pleasant -- sometimes they live way out<br/>\nin the country, nowhere near friends, and really are suffering from<br/>\nlack of social contact. A lot of the kids are HORRIBLY behaved, not<br/>\njust &quot;free spirits&quot; but rude, destructive, violent -- basically, imo,<br/>\nexpressing a deep-seated discomfort and unhappiness with their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the school-at-homers were even worse than the unschoolers.<br/>\nWhen I looked around to see who did have the best relationship with<br/>\ntheir kids, which kids seemed happiest and nicest and most comfortable<br/>\nwith their lives, which parents seemed most in tune with their kids<br/>\nand most concerned to do what actually made them happy, it was the<br/>\n&quot;relaxed&quot; or &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschoolers -- and the attached-parenting<br/>\npeople who sent their kids to school. Most of the relaxed<br/>\nhomeschoolers had sent their kids to school originally and had brought<br/>\nthem home when they were unhappy and were spending a lot of their time<br/>\nthinking up fun stuff for them to do, not pressuring them to do what<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want, having academic goals in mind but accomplishing them<br/>\nin the most gentle, family-friendly way possible. The parents whose<br/>\nkids were still in school had kids who just liked school, adjusted to<br/>\nit well, and were perfectly happy, so they saw no reason to bring them<br/>\nhome. I&#39;m talking about a select group of school parents here, of<br/>\ncourse. They weren&#39;t obsessed with grades or achievement, parented<br/>\ngently and did lots of family stuff outside of school, intervened with<br/>\nthe school when there were problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I took a deep breath and sent my son to school. He loved it. The<br/>\nkids in his class were great. He made tons of friends. His teacher was<br/>\ngentle and creative and they did all kinds of fun stuff. I had no regrets.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years later, things weren&#39;t going so well . . . I had to pull him.<br/>\nI tried some relaxed-homeschooly stuff but he was very resistant. I<br/>\ndecided to check out unschooling again and found this list . . . I am<br/>\nso glad I did. It finally got through to me that I can parent the way<br/>\nI want -- very attuned -- and unschool. I honestly had never seen that<br/>\ncombination before. I wish I&#39;d been confident enough to make it up for<br/>\nmyself &lt;g&gt;. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I feel like I should look around my area again for some<br/>\nunschoolers who are more on my wavelength -- maybe I just fell in with<br/>\nthe wrong group before? Everyone else here seems to rave about how<br/>\nmuch more comfortable they are with unschoolers than with even the<br/>\nmost liberal school parents and that just hasn&#39;t been my experience --<br/>\nI tend to be seen as a pariah by the unschoolers around here because I<br/>\nhave cable TV and plastic toys!

I can only think that has to be good for<br/>\nsociety.<br/>\n<br/>\nGah. I still feel like I&#39;m sort of dancing around my point and unable<br/>\nto pin it down. I&#39;m going to revisit this later, once the Java God has<br/>\nshined down upon my sleep-deprived brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, 29 Sep 2004 17:13:06 EDT, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandradodd@...\">sandradodd@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandradodd@...\">sandradodd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; So...<br/>\n&gt; Teens who aren&#39;t in college aside for a moment, it seems that ever fall here<br/>\n&gt; and there the idea comes up of whether homeschoolers should have a<br/>\n&gt; responsibility to represent all homeschoolers in a good light.

But yet we *are* in the <br/>\nminority and we *do* care about the philosophy, so I guess yeah, kind <br/>\nof.  I don&#39;t think we should break stuff and leave big messes and <br/>\nblatantly disregard the rules of the places we go. I don&#39;t think we <br/>\nshould be rude and disrespectful of others.  But then again we <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t do those things anyway even if we don&#39;t care about making <br/>\nan impression for unschooling, so maybe my answer is no.  Maybe we <br/>\nshould just be ourselves and let who we are shine.  If we try to make <br/>\nourselves look more shiny than we really are, then the shine that <br/>\nothers will see isn&#39;t real.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even if we think we&#39;re being a good example, others might not <br/>\nthink we are.  If we are in Wal-mart with our kids at midnight, are <br/>\npeople going to talk about &quot;those wild unschoolers who have no <br/>\nbedtimes?&quot;  I think at that point, we should not choose to stay home <br/>\nat midnight and hide because of what others might think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at a fair today and one of the stands had decorative water <br/>\nfountains for yards.  My 5 year old put his hand in the water while <br/>\nwe were looking at them and the guy said, &quot;Ooooh, I wouldn&#39;t put my <br/>\nfingers in there, the water is all dirty&quot;. Luke immediately took his <br/>\nhand out, and a lady the guy was waiting on said looked right at me <br/>\nand said, &quot;Some people nowadays just don&#39;t care about their kids&quot;.  <br/>\nUGH!  (No, the water wasn&#39;t that dirty and the kids have had their <br/>\nhands in worse just playing outside in the yard).  Now that lady <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know we are unschoolers, but if she had, should I have worried <br/>\nthat I made a bad impression because I let my 5 year old put his <br/>\nfingers in &quot;dirty&quot; water?  No, I don&#39;t think so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if our kids do something unusual ordering from a menu?  Order <br/>\ndessert first?  Order something and then barely eat it?  Will people <br/>\nlook at us and think poorly of us because of that?   I don&#39;t think we <br/>\nshould care at that point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we take an 8 year old to a museum and the guide realizes he can&#39;t <br/>\nread?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think worrying about making a good impression would just wear us <br/>\nout, and it could be for nothing.  We might see all the joy and peace <br/>\nand know that we&#39;re shining but others might just see the non-reader <br/>\nand the late bedtime and the fingers in &quot;dirty&quot; water.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"representing unschoolers (responsibility)","postDate":"1096492386","msgId":99997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyLjQ0NzY3YTk4LjJlOGM3ZjYyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":100003,"prevInTime":99996,"nextInTime":99998,"topicId":99997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So...
