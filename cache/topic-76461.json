I can still understand <br/>\ns-l-o-w Spanish and read a good bit---haltingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had one pathetic year of college German and then spent my junior year in <br/>\nGermany and Austria. Then I married into the Air Force and spent three more <br/>\nyears there. Total immersion. I am basically fluent (my writing leaves a bit to be <br/>\ndesired, but I can read well and carry on an extended conversation---I don&#39;t <br/>\njust translate: I think in German.<br/>\n<br/>\nFive years of high school Latin and one college semester of Greek. I can <br/>\nstill translate Latin (and I remember most of the Lord&#39;s Prayer and Twinkle <br/>\nTwinkle Little Star!), but all I remember in Greek is probably the letters! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving &quot;learned&quot; languages several different ways, I&#39;m positive the typical <br/>\nschool drill is useless. Total immersion---&quot;sink or swim&quot;---works because it <br/>\nHAS to. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople ask me all the time how to teach a child a foreign language. I tell <br/>\nthem to move to another country! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13788,"nextTopicId":76459}}
