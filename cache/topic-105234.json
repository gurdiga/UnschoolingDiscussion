The only cures for those self doubts are to read and watch I<br/>\nfind. Read as much as you can, as many related books and personal<br/>\nexperiences a,d watch your son. Watch as he goes about his day and learns<br/>\nfrom what is around him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi my name is Elaina. I&#39;m 26 and have a 7 year old DD, 5 year old DS,<br/>\n&gt; and 3 year old DD. This has been our first year homeschooling. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; noticed over the past few months that we follow a more unschool<br/>\n&gt; approach. So I&#39;m looking more into just what the unschool philosphy<br/>\n&gt; is, what works for different families and just how do you get over<br/>\n&gt; your own self doubts. Right now we are with a charter school but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not sure if I want to use a charter school again next year. Mostly<br/>\n&gt; since my DS likes to do the majority of his learning through watching<br/>\n&gt; and talking about what he sees and the charter school makes you tuen<br/>\n&gt; in worksheets as proof of schooling. My son would rather die than sit<br/>\n&gt; still and do a worksheet. But then I come full circle back to my own<br/>\n&gt; self doubts and think how can he learn if he isn&#39;t sitting down doing<br/>\n&gt; any actual lessons. I look forward to hearing what everyone has to say.<br/>\n&gt; Elaina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yahoo!
