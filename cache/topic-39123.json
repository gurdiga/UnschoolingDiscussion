He will actually get up<br/>\nand walk away if they won&#39;t settle! down.  He doesn&#39;t know how to be a<br/>\nkid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that this subject was a few days ago (we&#39;ve been gone for a long<br/>\nweekend and I am now sitting here catching up), but it did remind me of<br/>\nmy 7 yo ds&#39;s karate class.  Most of his class is made up of homeschooled<br/>\nkids between the ages of 6 and 12.  The kids in the class who are<br/>\nunschooled are in the class to learn, they sit and watch, they listen<br/>\nwith respect, and they are the ones who practice at home.  The kids who<br/>\nare not unschooled, even though they technically don&#39;t go to school,<br/>\nspend most of the time socializing with each other.  It drives my son<br/>\ncrazy!  I like the explanation given by someone that there schooling is<br/>\nrigid and they are blowing off some steam. I&#39;m going to use it the next<br/>\ntime my son leaves the floor because his friends want to use this time<br/>\nto visit.<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39038,"nextTopicId":39030}}
