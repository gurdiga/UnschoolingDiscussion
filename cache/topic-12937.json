I worked for Congress back<br/>\nthen (many 60 hour weeks, but I loved it ---I&#39;m a political junkie! )  We<br/>\nlived in the DC metro area for 6 1/2 years (in Maryland, at first; then, in<br/>\nVirginia).  We left in June of 1993 for me to take a policy position with<br/>\nthe State of Mississippi.  We had always planed to go back up there (I was<br/>\ngoing to go to law school  and go back to the Hill as an attorney) and my<br/>\nhubby, who has a law degree, was going to get his masters in history.<br/>\nWell, I never got to law school and the Congress changed from Democratic<br/>\ncontrol to that (expletive deleted) bunch we have now.  He didn&#39;t get too<br/>\nfar along on his masters either.  We even sold our house and moved back up<br/>\nthere in 1996 thinking that we were going to take back the House!  So much<br/>\nfor believing in causes (I still believe).  I&#39;m just a bit slower to sell<br/>\nthe property and move-- we did that FIRST!  You live and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we are in the Texas Hill Country now and have decided to move to the<br/>\nNW.  Gonna find jobs and a nice place to live BEFORE we sell the house (&<br/>\nvery small ranch) this time!<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez!  Did I go on and on or what?!!!  But I am proud of myself!  I have<br/>\nkept quiet through several political discussions and haven&#39;t flamed a soul<br/>\n(in quite some time---never have on this list).<br/>\n<br/>\nMelodie  (a yellow dog democrat----I&#39;m so left that I&#39;m almost right [which<br/>\n,of course, would be wrong! IMO)  =)<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Melodie, where in the DC &#39;burbs&#39; are you?  My dh&#39;s db and family<br/>\n&gt;live in Fairfax, is that anywhere near you?  We&#39;d love to go over<br/>\n&gt;and visit &#39;em, but I kind-of wonder if I&#39;d go nuts, since their life is<br/>\n&gt;so opposite ours (bil&#39;s wife went back to work within weeks of<br/>\n&gt;birth, as standard, and justified it by saying that they daycare<br/>\n&gt;people would be better at it than her, as if that makes a<br/>\n&gt;difference, babies need mothers!!!!!!, but I digress, as usual...)<br/>\n&gt;So if you are in that neck of the proverbial woods, I&#39;d love to have<br/>\n&gt;some contact with someone more on my wavelength while I was<br/>\n&gt;there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tracy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12936,"nextTopicId":12365}}
