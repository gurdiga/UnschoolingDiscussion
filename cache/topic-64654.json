I have heard many like it<br/>\nfrom others. <br/>\nI voiced this same belief some months ago and nearly<br/>\ngot my head chewed off. Be careful :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hadn&#39;t given it much thought - being &quot;chosen&quot; by<br/>\n&gt; my kids, but one day when<br/>\n&gt; Mackenzie was 2, he said to me &quot;Remember that time<br/>\n&gt; when you were dressed<br/>\n&gt; like a white princess and you walked down a long<br/>\n&gt; trail with lots of people<br/>\n&gt; beside it and dad was standing on the other end, and<br/>\n&gt; I was floating on the<br/>\n&gt; ceiling and watching you?&quot; All I can figure from<br/>\n&gt; that conversation was that<br/>\n&gt; he was present at our wedding, *years* before he was<br/>\n&gt; conceived. Asa has said<br/>\n&gt; some very similar stuff when she was a young<br/>\n&gt; toddler, she mentioned our<br/>\n&gt; wedding once too. I do believe now that they chose<br/>\n&gt; us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt;    -Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
