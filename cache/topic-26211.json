What I realized was that I have <br/>\nthe suggestion that Joyce suggested &quot;a husband that does laundry all the <br/>\ntime&quot;....  I think it&#39;s hearing him complain and dumping the laundry in the <br/>\nliving room at 9pm at night and telling me &quot;that&#39;s the 4th load of laundry <br/>\nI&#39;ve done&quot;, makes me feel like I&#39;m guilty for not doing it all... I think <br/>\ninstead of feeling guilty is to just say &quot;I know sweetie, it&#39;s so wonderful <br/>\nthat you have the stamina and desire to do all that laundry&quot;.... Maybe he <br/>\njust wants someone to praise him....<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t mind doing a lot of the laundry except the majority is his and the <br/>\nboys.  Everytime DH uses a towel it goes in the laundry.... so really looking <br/>\nback on what I&#39;ve written this is another problem for my husband to deal with <br/>\nand not me (LOL)...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went through this with the cleaning, when I said I wouldn&#39;t clean the <br/>\nbathrooms and he could either hire a cleaner or do it himself.  He moaned and <br/>\ngroaned for several months doing it (I&#39;d never done bathrooms in our entire 7 <br/>\nyear relationship) and then he finally said &quot;let&#39;s get a cleaner&quot;.....  Maybe <br/>\nthe same thing will happen with the laundry....<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for sock, paper clips and pens.... they are all disappearing in my house <br/>\nas well...<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;-George <br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26210,"nextTopicId":26214}}
