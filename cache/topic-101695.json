You&#39;ve got <br/>\nentrepreneurs like Bill Gates (who dropped out to spend more time <br/>\ndeveloping a little company called Microsoft) saying Look, a college <br/>\ndegree isn&#39;t essential for everyone. Yes, for some things it helps - <br/>\nif you want to get anywhere in accounting, a CPA helps. If you want <br/>\nto be a college professor, an MA or PhD is usually required. For <br/>\nmedical professions, the MD or RN or whatever are required for <br/>\nlicensing purposes. But the guy who used to be my boss and is now in <br/>\nupper management in this software development firm doesn&#39;t have a <br/>\ncollege degree. The guy in the next office to me (same job, same <br/>\npay) has a 2 yr tech school diploma. More and more, if you have <br/>\nevidence that you can do the work, you&#39;ll get the job. Sometimes a <br/>\ncollege degree is just an easier way to get that proof - but I&#39;ve <br/>\nknown many degreed people in my career who really were slim on <br/>\nability to actually do the job they were hired to do. And, <br/>\nsometimes, spending the same 4 or 5 years working your way in from <br/>\nthe bottom up is just as acceptable. DH worked as a stocker in <br/>\nretail, in a mailroom, and in a shop situation (cutting sheets of <br/>\nplastic for something or other) BUT he also taught himself enough <br/>\ncomputer skills (back in the late 80s and early 90s) that he was <br/>\nhired to do phone support for a software company - the big skills <br/>\nthey wanted were self-motivated learner and creative problem-solver. <br/>\nFrom there he moved to another company where in addition to phone <br/>\nsupport he taught himself HTML (back in the hand-type it into <br/>\nNotepad days) and became their web designer and BBS manager. THEN he <br/>\nfound something totally different that lit him up and *chose* a <br/>\ncollege degree as a way to pursue it and had a blast in college (we <br/>\nhad been married 2 years by the time he started, a decade after high <br/>\nschool where he was told he wasn&#39;t college material - ha on them he <br/>\ngraduated with a 3.99 GPA because it was *his choice* and *his* <br/>\ngoal). My former roommate went from high school to working at Dunkin <br/>\nDonuts and playing with a Commodore 64 in her spare time. When an <br/>\nopening came up where I was working (trainability and computer <br/>\nliterate were the qualifications for the position as circulation <br/>\nmanager for a niche computer industry newsletter), she got the job. <br/>\nShe went from there to a job with EDS in Dallas and now she works <br/>\nfrom her home in NJ still for EDS - not a lick of college anywhere, <br/>\njust lots of willingness to learn. So, whether college is necessary <br/>\nin employment really depends on what it is you are shooting for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other part to that question, IMO, is social: do people look down <br/>\non those without a degree? does a person without a degree miss out <br/>\non something *essential* in society? I&#39;d have to say no on both <br/>\ncounts with explanation. Yes, there are always some who will look <br/>\ndown on others for any or no reason. If you don&#39;t go to college or <br/>\ngo to a &quot;lesser&quot; college or live in the &quot;wrong&quot; neighborhood or <br/>\nwhatever. And yes there are some things (dorm life, cafeteria <br/>\nfood, &quot;all nighters&quot;, etc) that are semi-pervasive in the culture <br/>\n(movies, music, late night TV jokes) - but then again there are many <br/>\npeople with college degrees who commuted or lived at home or <br/>\nwhatever too, so that&#39;s not a be-all, end-all either. Just as the <br/>\nhigh school prom and lockers and cafeteria food are not the be-all <br/>\nend-all of high school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it getting harder and harder to get accepted into colleges?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so. On the contrary, due to costs, colleges are <br/>\nseeking ways to keep enrollment up so their income stays up as more <br/>\npeople choose to go right to work, intern, apprentice, use online <br/>\ncourses and the like, etc. There is also a sharp trend toward <br/>\nentrepreneurial start-ups and self-employed, work from home <br/>\nsituations where someone finds a niche and fills it - without <br/>\nnecessarily needing a college degree, just the skills and <br/>\nconnections to get up and running.  In the last newsletter thing we <br/>\ngot from DH&#39;s alma mater (a private 4 yr university), enrollment was <br/>\nway up - so I don&#39;t think it is getting harder to get in, just <br/>\nharder to afford maybe (DH&#39;s alma mater tends to give lots of <br/>\nassistance - in addition to loans and a campus job, DH got a grant <br/>\nwhen I was pregnant because we&#39;d have additional expenses with DS - <br/>\nthe school&#39;s own financial aid application is really important <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s where you can give additional info regarding your <br/>\nsituation). <br/>\n<br/>\nA search on college enrollment statistics got me lots of hits so <br/>\nthat might help you as well if that sort of data is more telling for <br/>\nyour DH than anecdotal evidences.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","postDate":"1103794258","msgId":101699,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJERUZGQTgxLjJGNjA1JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWM0ZTg2YyRlMGY3OTM1MCQ2NDAzYThjMEBqb2huPg=="},"prevInTopic":101695,"nextInTopic":101705,"prevInTime":101698,"nextInTime":101700,"topicId":101695,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just received an email from Amazon announcing that HP #6 would be released on July 16!
