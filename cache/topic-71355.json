She is very resistant to sleep.  She always has been the type who doesn&#39;t want to miss anything.  Her dad and I like to have a bit of time in the evening that we are awake, but not engaged with Davan, as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, this is what we&#39;ve come to.  She has a room time, instead of a bed time.  We do all the bed time stuff - snack, teeth brushing, a book if she wants one, hugs, kisses, good-nights at room time.  Then she is responsible for herself.  She doesn&#39;t have to stay in her room exclusively, she isn&#39;t a prisoner, but we do encourage her to be in her room.  It&#39;s easier for her to remember that she&#39;s playing on her on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe really likes listening to books on tape, so she has those on, which we don&#39;t allow on the main stereo after &quot;room time&quot;, which also encourages her to play in her room.  She listens to tapes and plays until she feels tired, then listens to tape in bed until she falls asleep.  If she wakes up at night, she turns her tape back on and sometimes even gets up and plays again for a while.  It turns out that she really likes to sleep with the lights on, as well.  I&#39;ve always thought it was very difficult to sleep well with the lights on, so have imposed lights out on her, but she doesn&#39;t need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad leaves for work at 5 and goes in to say good morning every morning and reads her a poem (she likes poems).  She then almost always joins me in bed for the rest of the morning.  In my room, though, there is no tape to listen to and the room is dark.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;d want to be there all night due to this, but I must admit that I haven&#39;t offered.  She used to family bed, but when we moved a little over a year ago she chose to start sleeping in her own bed in her own room.  The novelty of it might have worn off and she might have started family bedding again, but we moved from a king to a double at the same time.  So, we&#39;d rather she wasn&#39;t there all night - too cramped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefit of this plan to me is multifold.  She&#39;s happy enough about &quot;room time&quot;, so no bed time fights.  I get a bit of time in the evening to relax without needing to engage.  Here&#39;s a big one, though:  I have no idea how much time she is sleeping, so I have no basis for thinking she is grumpy due to lack of sleep.  Sometimes it seems that if I think she hasn&#39;t slept enough and is grumpy, it comes true.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope you find a solution!<br/>\n<br/>\nNicholina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Bedtime questions","postDate":"1054311270","msgId":71426,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWMzMjZjNiQ4ZDQ4MWY0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGJiNmpvNSs3dG8yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71382,"nextInTopic":71473,"prevInTime":71424,"nextInTime":71427,"topicId":71355,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Olga  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1514568605\">From: &quot;Olga&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:britcontoo@...\">britcontoo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;How do I allow him to go to bed when he is tired which is never before 10<br/>\nif he is not directed to go to<br/>\nbed and still be a happy, well rested child?

Finally, I gave <br/>\nup and thought it will be easier to start from scratch and erased <br/>\nit!  Probably missed out on some great things, oh well..LOL!!  <br/>\nAnyway, I had a question about bedtime.  We are pretty relaxed about <br/>\nbedtime.  I have been trying to get my older son to regulate his own <br/>\nbedtime.  The 2 yo seems to be better at is because if he is tired he <br/>\nwill either stay in his bed or fall asleep somewhere in the afternoon <br/>\nand get a nice nap.  My almost 5yo is different.  I have no problem <br/>\nwith him staying up later.  However, he usually fights the idea of <br/>\ngoing to bed because he wants to stay up and force Dad to play Harry <br/>\npotter on the computer!  I would not mind except after a few 10 <br/>\noclock nights and no naps he is just a crabby little boy.  The <br/>\nreality is he need more sleep.  How do I allow him to go to bed when <br/>\nhe is tired which is never before 10 if he is not directed to go to <br/>\nbed and still be a happy, well rested child?
