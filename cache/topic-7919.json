He&#39;s into sports.  He builds <br/>\nthings like bike trails and ramps.  He&#39;s good at fixing things.  (His <br/>\nfriends ask for his help fixing bikes, and he&#39;s been going to the bike <br/>\nstore to use some of their tools.  I think he&#39;s made a good impression on <br/>\nthem and may eventually get hired there.)  He&#39;s a good worker.  (He just <br/>\nfinished working full time for his dad for a few weeks.  Rod said his work <br/>\nhabits were quite good.)  He knows how to do at least one trade (tree <br/>\nplanting) that would put food on his table or put him through <br/>\nuniversity.  He also knows that he doesn&#39;t want to do that for a <br/>\nliving.

I&#39;m just now (after a<br/>\nfew months) able to get her to even entertain the idea of seeing outside<br/>\nhelp from the medical community.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she had a serious physical problem that required treatment (ie.<br/>\nsuspicious mole, sx of diabetes etc.) would you still be trying to convince<br/>\nher to go or would you say I&#39;m sorry but for your safety, I need to take you<br/>\nto see a doctor and then take her? (and I am one of those parents who<br/>\nattempts to respect my kids autonomy and choices.) Whether a problem is<br/>\nphysical or emotional, it should be treated as equal, IMO.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Good suggestions and we did try them. One of the kids gave her some grief<br/>\n </span></blockquote>over not being able to read yet and that was the end of that. :( She refused<br/>\nto go back to the park days.... said she hated them and never liked going in<br/>\nthe first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n****Is there more to the HS community than park days? Sometimes a large<br/>\nnumber of children can be overwhelming, especially those children that are<br/>\nshy. Maybe smaller activities are better<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Yes, I know but then, do you *ever* step in and *do* something?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course! If my child is in immediate danger than I would step in. If she<br/>\ncan&#39;t read at 11 (and my dd may not) then I would look, listen adn discuss<br/>\nsome possible reasons, I would check if she has any physical reasons for not<br/>\nreading, I would probably then a.) take her to a specialist for a physical<br/>\nor emotional  problem or b.) relax. Children do things in their own time. I<br/>\nwould take that as a mantra and repeat it constantly.<br/>\n  I mean, hind-sight is 20/20. If I had *known* that this child would have<br/>\nsuch problems now because of not learning this stuff whenever she felt like<br/>\nit, I&#39;d have done something about it sooner. I would have pushed a little.<br/>\nBut I didn&#39;t ... I did the very unschooling &quot;let her do it when she&#39;s<br/>\nready.. leave her alone&quot; thing and now, I&#39;m not so sure it was the *right*<br/>\nthing to do for *THIS* child.<br/>\n<br/>\n****IMPO, I think unschooling IS right for every child. Because IMPO, it is<br/>\nfacillitating my child&#39;s desire to learn. It is not a method of<br/>\nhomeschooling. It is not even to me an educational philosophy, it is a<br/>\nlifestyle philosophy.<br/>\nMy suggestion about all this is to do just a few things.<br/>\n1. Have her see a therapist that SHE likes and is willing to talk to. Who<br/>\ncares if you consult with 10, sometimes it takes a while to find the right<br/>\none.<br/>\n2. Suggest to her that she may enjoy learning some of these basic skills<br/>\nfrom someone outside of the family, an older HSer, a college student or<br/>\nbeloved family friend.<br/>\n3. Try some smaller HS activities<br/>\n4. (and most important) BREATHE. She&#39;s only 11 and she&#39;s only &quot;behind&quot; if<br/>\nshe is viewed that way by those who love her and have her best welfare at<br/>\nheart. Keep on telling her that she WILL get this stuff one day, it may take<br/>\nsome creativity but you will help and support her and give her as much time<br/>\nas she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Somebody *please* .... pass me the parenting manual!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Put your name on the reserve list after mine!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Elissa </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lMQkER9IDk4Lh38jvbE9hpW-FWR_vhoHRUq8RyxKCDhLcXPpVs18Ni4RTz3N1m2zhdiZJTl69zCsTuyWJtDPt6wnwg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: spelling","postDate":"1006975144","msgId":28797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYzgwMWMxNzg0NiQwYWEwMzU4MCQ5NzVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+","referencesHeader":"PDAzYmMwMWMxNzgyYiRhOGE2OTFlMCQ0ODNiYWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4gPDAwOTAwMWMxNzgzMSQxM2I1YjI5MCQwMjAxYThjMEB6b29vZy5vcmc+"},"prevInTopic":28795,"nextInTopic":28798,"prevInTime":28796,"nextInTime":28798,"topicId":7919,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ya know, she might be like son #3.

AND I think I<br/>\nagree with both of you.  Yes, in a perfect world a child should not have<br/>\nto be pushed into learning.  But, we don&#39;t live in a perfect world.  It<br/>\nsounds to as if the 11 year old in question needs a little push to help<br/>\nher believe she can do it.  My son is nearly ten an he is just now<br/>\nlearning to read.  He only very recently learned to tell time on an<br/>\nanalog clock.  Six months ago he truly believed he could not do it -<br/>\neither thing.  My mother convinced him otherwise.  He needed her to<br/>\nbelieve in him enough to make him believe too.  She did that by never<br/>\ngiving up.  She lives next door and he goes there for a few hours a day. <br/>\nShe worked with him and helped him learn.  <br/>\nNow she helps the older two with math at their asking - they both want to<br/>\ntake the ACT in February.  <br/>\nBut the thing about individuality is that Wyndham would never have been<br/>\nable to ask for help.  He didn&#39;t understand that help was possible.  And<br/>\nI think that was partly the effect of his sister&#39;s never needing any help<br/>\nwith stuff like that.  He saw them learning everything by themselves and<br/>\nthought he should be able to and since he couldn&#39;t it was his problem.<br/>\nBut that&#39;s what should be the good thing about unschooling . . . we are<br/>\nfree to figure out for ourselves what our children need.  Two of mine<br/>\ndon&#39;t need encouragement to learn, the third did.  <br/>\nAnd the original thought on this thread was that there are some &quot;basics&quot;<br/>\nthat all should know.  Maybe that should say most should know?  I do<br/>\nthink that nearly every child needs to learn (eventually)  to read and<br/>\nmaybe do some basic math - adding and subtracting.  I think most will<br/>\nlearn with no trouble and little help.  Beyond that, I don&#39;t think there<br/>\nis any &#39;core&#39; knowledge that everyone needs.

I remember onnce when a friend of Cacie&#39;s<br/>\nwho was 15 at the time asked how to spell a word that Cacie knew how to<br/>\nspell (and spelling is not her strong suit). He was okay with it, she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t think less of him (although she was proud that she could help him)<br/>\nand nobody thought less of him. She has friends who are 9 and 10 who are<br/>\njust learning to read and write, and friends who are 9 who are just<br/>\nlearning to calculate simple arithmetic problems. It just doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nmatter. When she&#39;s with schooled kids, it&#39;s usually during soccer or<br/>\ndrama, and she&#39;s pretty good at both of those things (she has a lot more<br/>\ntime to practice :-) and the times that her writing and spelling have<br/>\ncome up during dramam class - no one has ever mentioned them to her, but<br/>\nshe has felt self-conscious - it has become quickly apparent that her<br/>\nacting skills are what really matters in that setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah, you&#39;ve said that your duaghter can&#39;t tell time or count to 100 and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have any friends. I don&#39;t think most of Cacie&#39;s friends know<br/>\nwhether she can do those things or not - no one has ever asked.  In other<br/>\nwords, I&#39;m not sure having friends around her age  (and I&#39;m assuming that<br/>\nyou don&#39;t mean exactly her age, but within  few years) has anything to do<br/>\nwith those skills. Learning how to get along with other kids requires a<br/>\nunique set of social skills, and I think that as unschooling parents, we<br/>\ncan help our kids learn them when they clearly seem to want to. It&#39;s<br/>\nharder, because they&#39;re really more unwritten, but when we moved here a<br/>\nfew months ago I watched as Cacie came to a big park day full of kids and<br/>\nreally used some pretty sophisticated skills to hook up with some other<br/>\nkids.

Even if you<br/>\nparent your children in exactly the same way the<br/>\ndifferences in their personalities makes them<br/>\n*perceive* the parenting differently. Their brains are<br/>\ndifferent and work differently. You may have found<br/>\nthat if you had done the exact same thing with both of<br/>\nthem that nothing would be different now. I suppose<br/>\nit&#39;s a question that we&#39;ll never know the answer to.<br/>\nAlso what do you mean by &quot;doing better&quot;? In what way?<br/>\nMaybe the one who isn&#39;t &#39;doing as well&#39; is better at<br/>\nother less academic things, does that make those<br/>\nactivities less valuable? And maybe he&#39;ll come into<br/>\nhis own academically as he matures. I think we are so<br/>\nconditioned as a society to think that academics are<br/>\nthe be all and end all of education that we forget<br/>\nabout the myriad of other possibilities. I firmly<br/>\nbelieve that a child  will get the &#39;basics&#39; he needs<br/>\nall on his own as they become relative to his<br/>\ninterests. Trusting in the process is the hardest<br/>\npart. And I should know because I regularly go through<br/>\nperiods of doubt and uncertainty. Oh good! I guess<br/>\nthat means I&#39;m normal and healthy?! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
