Hats?  yes.  Okay.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI made pancakes and sausage for all of them.  Keith made juice, Holly set the <br/>\ntable, all got full.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister calls pretty frantic because the twelve-year-old son of a family <br/>\nthey know who live in a town near Las Vegas, NM, is missing.  Two days <br/>\nmissing, and she wants them to look for him at Edgefest.  She&#39;s not calming <br/>\ndown.  I said &quot;Do you want to ruin their day? I&#39;ll paraphrase.&quot;   I convinced <br/>\nher that if he ran away he probably would not go to Edgefest, and if he was <br/>\nabducted, the abductor would not take him to Edgefest, and so to wait until <br/>\nin the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the kotei batch had left, and I said calmly to the remaining set that if <br/>\nthey saw Skye they should call me or Ruth (my former sister-in-law, from my <br/>\nlong-ago first marriage, and close friend of the mom) so we could let his mom <br/>\nknow he&#39;s okay, because she&#39;s not sure where he is.  I said it calmly, <br/>\nwithout panic or details.  They said fine.  I gave them phone numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly goes to two classes, Holly auditions for some photo thing (they liked <br/>\nher and spent a lot of time with her, and then asked her how tall her parents <br/>\nare. Very tall?  Wah.  I&#39;m 5&#39;4&quot; but Holly wasn&#39;t sure.  She said her dad was <br/>\ntall but her mom says she&#39;s not too tall).<br/>\n<br/>\nHome, all ten teens are still out, Keith says my sister called before her <br/>\nthree kids and their two friends left to say they had found Skye in an <br/>\narroyo, dead.  Keith opted not to offer the phone to the kids, convincing my <br/>\nsister they would NOT search the concert site for him, but just planned <br/>\ncasually to glance around and call if they saw him.  Better not to ruin their <br/>\nday.  My sister agreed, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby and crew came back.  The winner (of the fancy-sword prize) was a friend <br/>\nof theirs, so they were happy for him.  Kirby had lost to a cheater from <br/>\nUtah, he said--literally cheating,  drawing cards in a sleight-of-hand way, <br/>\nand having nine cards  after playing two, when the hand limit was eight.  But <br/>\nsince Kirby works there he was bending over backwards to be hospitable to <br/>\npeople, and thought he could whip him anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other kids came back late, REALLY exhausted, didn&#39;t say anything about <br/>\nSkye (and I was glad).  One was sun poisoned, pretty sick, and we got her <br/>\nAleve, much water, and some quiet.    One had a mosh-pit scrape on his back, <br/>\nand the last three seemed to have survived okay, but all were droopy-tired.  <br/>\nThree slept out on our upstairs deck, five on floor and couch in the library, <br/>\nand my own boys in their own rooms (probably tired from the overwhelming day).<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday morning, I watched the last third of Gone With the Wind (for the first <br/>\ntime seeing it, and it was cool).  I was folding clothes while watching a <br/>\nvideo.  Most teens were up, in various stages of finding out Skye was dead.  <br/>\nI went in after my sister had talked to all three of her kids, and talked to <br/>\nthem.  I apologized for knowing and not saying more, and they understood.  I <br/>\ntold them until the autopsy it woudln&#39;t be known what happened, and even then <br/>\nmaybe not.  The body had been &quot;pretty banged up&quot; was the only quote we had so <br/>\nfar.   There&#39;s the possibility of his friend being suspect.  The first story, <br/>\nWednesday, when he was first missing, was he left his friend&#39;s house to walk <br/>\nhome.  He didn&#39;t make it.  He was found in an arroyo (a ravine) the other <br/>\ndirection.   So I told the kids not to guess yet until more was known.  <br/>\nCould&#39;ve been the boys were playing too rough and he got badly hurt and his <br/>\nfriend panicked.  Could be someone hit him with a pickup and panicked and <br/>\ntook him and hid him.  Maybe a mountain lion, or dogs (we know instances of <br/>\nboth, in our lives, in Northern New Mexico).  Possibly, but not necessarily, <br/>\nabduction and murder.  But for them to keep calm and be careful and that they <br/>\nwould probably need to go to the funeral this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby got in the shower, needing to be at work before 11:30.  I sent his <br/>\neight balled-up pairs of clean socks with Holly up to his room so they would <br/>\nbe there when he got out of the shower.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the whole weekend, delivering clean, sorted socks to his room felt like <br/>\na huge privilege, not a job.  I KNOW that he dealt with things this weekend <br/>\nmuch more educational and important than sock-supply, and it&#39;s only noon on <br/>\nSunday.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  I forgot discovering that our huge juniper tree had been blown by the <br/>\nwind so hard that it had pulled one of its roots up from the ground some, and <br/>\nthere were cracks in the ground like a little earthquake, about three feet <br/>\nsquare, and that visible root, about 2&quot; diameter.

Maybe I&#39;ll go look on construction sites for older <br/>\n  plants that are going to be trashed anyway.  We&#39;ll get some firewood out of <br/>\n  the deal--whatever we want to pull out of the pile before they get back <br/>\n  Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our kids are alive, and so losing a tree or missing a social moment aren&#39;t <br/>\n  the end of the world.  And who gets clean socks from one room to another is <br/>\n  positively miniscule.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Almost everyone&#39;s gone from the house at the moment and it&#39;s quiet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
