We are relatively new to this too and I am also using a combination of both approaches with my children. My Sadie (2 1/2 ) in particular is guiding me to what she wants to learn about and I am learning how to let her guide me. I am giving her the tools that she needs (great art and supplystuff, videos, musical instruments ect) and just letting her go at it. We are in Massachusetts and I am hoping to meet some others soon.
