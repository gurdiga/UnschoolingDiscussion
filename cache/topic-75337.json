Now I have days when I feel obligated or guilty for not vaxing the two wee ones and think it would be no big deal.  So I start hunting down the smart vax info on the net which brings me back to the &quot;no way&quot; can this be safe side and I go over my how to live without vaxing info..<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very hard to live with the barrage from both sides.  Each saying they are the right and good side with one major difference in the literature.  The anti vax side wants you to get informed and make your own decision based on all the info you can find.  The pro vax side will not even effectively inform the people who are in charge of administering the Vaccines about all possible complications etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nTeresa in Canada<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, June 24, 2003 1:52 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] vaccinations OT?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 6/24/2003 2:21:24 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ctbucknum@...\">ctbucknum@...</a> writes:<br/>\n  I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t make cense of your post.
