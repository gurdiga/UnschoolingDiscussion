Or &quot;mealtime&quot; exactly. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n       I think the set family dinner may have sprung from the same schoolish <br/>\ncontext context as tv limits. <br/>\n<br/>\n       In a schooling family, especially one with traditionally employed <br/>\nparents, what other regular family time is even possible, much less likely? It <br/>\ntakes a major commitment by each family member, maybe sacrifice of other <br/>\nenjoyable plans and choices, to manage formal dinnertime together regularly. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Imo this is similar to the schoolish idea of screen time as an <br/>\nunacceptable interference with homework, or with the tiny remaining slivers of <br/>\nafternoon into which schooled children must shoehorn all outdoor activity and <br/>\npursuit of individual interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n       But in our unschooling, we&#39;ve found such unnecessary contrivance <br/>\nisn&#39;t, well, necessary! <br/>\n<br/>\n       All the worthwhile goals of formal mealtime -- togetherness, parental <br/>\nmodeling, companionable conversations and of course sufficient ingesting of <br/>\nvaried and nutritious foodstuffs &lt;g&gt; -- can be achieved by unschoolers *without* <br/>\nthe actual mealtime, just as we can achieve the goals of healthy outdoor <br/>\nactivity and plenty of time for pursuits of interest without limiting tv. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       I remain astonished (after a decade or more, depending on how I count <br/>\nit) at what falls naturally into place, if a family can just break the <br/>\ngravitational pull of &quot;school&quot; and chart its own path through time and space.
