Boy did she bloom in the past 4 <br/>\nmonths! I have a quiet, somewhat sullen child, who never talks loud enough <br/>\nfor the car radio to be on. <br/>\n    She got up yesterday and wanted to know about the lights on the side of a <br/>\nsmokestack. Yes, I understand they are just beacons, but to Tiff.... WOW! She <br/>\nlearned how the lights work in the van, what a jump was (yep, our battery <br/>\ndied...) and even how the &quot;stuff&quot; gets in the filled donuts. This is my <br/>\ndream! And Tiffany, again WOW. <br/>\n    This AM I am still lightheaded from her. She just sailed through the day. <br/>\nI even ?? her on the things we spoke about last night. Other than the <br/>\nairplanes flying UNDER the lights (yes, that is backwards, over honey.) she <br/>\nwas retaining EVERYTHING! Even that Daddy went to the police station and she <br/>\nsaw pictures of the dogs that work there! YES!!!<br/>\n    I had to share this with all of you! For those who met Tiff, you know <br/>\nthat this is spectacular! For those who haven&#39;t- This is spectacular! LOL <br/>\n    A word of note, in proofreading, I see it looks like Dad was in trouble. <br/>\nThat is not right. Wanted to set record for that. Today will be another <br/>\nblooming day for the princess, we will be on the road. I hope she keeps this <br/>\nup, I am so amazed, I just had to share! <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nTeacher and Mommy of 4 homeschooling fanatics, wife to the best principal, <br/>\nprotector of many pets and wild ones, and unpublished writer.<br/>\n<br/>\n            ***Life&#39;s Learnings Academy - Protecting Our Children***<br/>\n        IT&#39;S GREAT TO LEARN WHERE THE PRINCIPAL LOVES YOU<br/>\n                           ICQ: 43428000     AOL IM: Lifeslearn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5445,"nextTopicId":5460}}
