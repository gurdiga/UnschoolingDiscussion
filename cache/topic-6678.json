I began by reading and using the recipes in The Soap Book by Sandy Maine.  This was her first book on soapmaking but I believe she has several others now.  All the rec<br/>\nipes in this book are vegetarian (meaning they don&#39;t use tallow or lard) and are scented using herbal essential oils (which is by far the most expensive ingredient).  <br/>\n<br/>\nStacia:<br/>\n<br/>\nThank You! It&#39;s funny how a person can use different search engines and never come up with what their looking for. That&#39;s one reason I like this list! I think she will like several of the books offered here. Thanks again, we really appreciate the info...Aleasa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6654,"nextTopicId":6679}}
