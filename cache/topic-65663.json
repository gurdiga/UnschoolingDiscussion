That&#39;s what I keep telling everyone!  (And myself occasionally!)  My <br/>\nhusband and I were talking about this last night (he&#39;s worried) and I told <br/>\nhim I bet he will rue the day he ever complained!  Our 2 yr old and 6 yr old <br/>\ntalk our heads off!  My friends son didn&#39;t talk until right after his second <br/>\nbirthday, then he came up to her one day and said, &#39;I wanna go to Grandma&#39;s <br/>\nhouse!&#39;.  I was on the ohone with her when he said it.  It was SO funny!  He <br/>\nhad only ever said Mama before and that was it!  I expect that Caeleb, too, <br/>\nwill bypass single and double word sentences for paragraphs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the comments.  Sometimes, after a long spell of my husband&#39;s <br/>\ndoubts, I begin to doubt myself and just need some reassurance.  The baby <br/>\nwas up all night last night, so I guess I had a LOT of time on my hands to <br/>\nworry about everything!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
