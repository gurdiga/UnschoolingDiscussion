He&#39;ll be nine March 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote months ago about his reading. Since then, he&#39;s progressed so much! He can read any note I leave for him (Ben&#39;s are harder to read &#39;cause Ben doesn&#39;t print! &lt;g&gt;). When I clean his room, I find books strewn from one end to the other---different kinds: &quot;baby&quot; books, nature books, _Scooby-Doo_, _Charlotte&#39;s Web_---a jumbled assortment. He&#39;s just picking them up and reading what he can. He asked Cam the other night to read a precious signed copy of &quot;Spawn&quot;---the comic book. Cam says Duncan knew almost every word. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks ago, he asked to go to the book store to buy _Faeries&#39; Landing_. He was through with it in a few days. We went right back to buy issues two and three. He insisted on paying for them with his own money. Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron (the child who said he would never read again! &lt;G&gt;) has two new magazine subscriptions (Relix & Modern Drummer) and a mess of new books (mostly on music and musicians). I went looking for the dictionary to make sure how to spell sergeant (it just didn&#39;t look right! &lt;g&gt;): I found it in Cam&#39;s room! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nCameron said he was really enjoying watching Duncan as he learned to read and do math in his head. It makes it *real* for Cameron to see it happen in someone else---with no pressure and out of pure love and desire to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t tell me unschooling doesn&#39;t &#39;work&#39;!<br/>\n<br/>\nOH! And Cameron has just recently started playing video games with Duncan----and LIKES them! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s VERY exciting to watch!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140747339,"authorName":"Jenny Altenbach","from":"Jenny Altenbach &lt;salten@...&gt;","profile":"brownaltenbach","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling reading","postDate":"1107030427","msgId":102876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxRkJGMTlCLjQwOTA5MDdAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGN0Z3IwbCthNThuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGN0Z3IwbCthNThuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102871,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":102875,"nextInTime":102877,"topicId":102864,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are <br/>\nonly certain shirts he will wear.  It has to be &quot;soft&quot; enough, and it <br/>\nhas to &quot;look good&quot;.  He&#39;s low on long sleeved shirts, so in spite of <br/>\nhaving lots of hand me downs that he&#39;s rejected, I took him to wal-<br/>\nmart to see if there were any there that he liked. Of all the shirts <br/>\nthey had at wal-mart there were only 2 he liked, and they were both <br/>\nsponge bob shirts.  One of them says, &quot;Go be stupid somewhere else&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, last night we were lying in his bed and he told me how much he <br/>\nlikes his new shirts.  And he said that he also knows which word on <br/>\nhis shirt says &quot;Go&quot;.  He said it&#39;s the word that has the G and the <br/>\no.  Cool!  He then pointed out that G and o are also in George, which <br/>\nhe knows because his favorite stuffed animal is a plush Curious <br/>\nGeorge. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s also figured out the words yes and no on animal crossing (video <br/>\ngame) and he recognizes the word zoo from a Putt Putt computer game. <br/>\nHe knows Mom from writing me notes, and he knows his name and his <br/>\nbrother&#39;s and sister&#39;s names from just seeing them a lot from <br/>\nlabeling stuff, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s neat for me to see him slowly learning about reading through <br/>\nunschooling!  I believed in the philosophy of unschooling before, but <br/>\nI hadn&#39;t had the chance to see it work with reading first hand with <br/>\none of my kids yet, because I started unschooling my daughter after I <br/>\nalready had taught her how to read.  So this is exciting for me to <br/>\nwatch!
