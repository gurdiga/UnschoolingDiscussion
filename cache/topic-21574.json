We &quot;made reading available&quot; simply by always <br/>\nhaving lots of stuff around to read, which we&#39;d have done whether we <br/>\nhad kids or not because we&#39;re both reading addicts. And we never <br/>\nreally went out of our way to have children&#39;s books or <br/>\nage-appropriate books for the kids - although we definitely had lots <br/>\nof them, everything from Dr. Seuss to those Disney movie tie-in <br/>\nbooks, and probably every &quot;Little Golden Book&quot; ever published, and <br/>\nentire sets of classics, kid-type encyclopedia sets, etc. But those <br/>\nare interesting to me, too, which seems like a good standard for <br/>\nwhether or not to have a book around. A couple of weeks ago I read <br/>\ntwo supposedly children&#39;s books in one night, both biographical <br/>\nfiction, those &quot;diaries kept by pioneer children&quot; type books, because <br/>\nthey were well-written and quite interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just always assumed the kids would read pretty much the same books <br/>\nwe did, only until they got old enough to actually read them they&#39;d <br/>\njust look at the pictures. Which they did. They&#39;d always ask us about <br/>\nphotos and drawings and artwork that interested them, and we&#39;d either <br/>\nexplain what it was, or read the caption or a bit of text about it. <br/>\nAround here, books never had that weird &quot;mystique&quot; some people seem <br/>\nto associate with them. They were just another tool, like a hammer or <br/>\nthe computer, and the kids used them with ever-increasing skill and <br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing we did have lots of - and which probably helped them all <br/>\nlearn to read - was books on tape. Not just the little storybook/tape <br/>\nsets, although we had dozens of those, but audiobooks on a vast range <br/>\nof subjects. We have hundreds of them now, with their own <br/>\nfloor-to-ceiling bookcase, and the favorites have had their cardboard <br/>\ncases taped back together numerous times. For us, our frequent road <br/>\ntrips were just good reasons to buy more audiobooks!<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, daughter Jody (21) was looking for a book on <br/>\nherbs just yesterday, combing the bookcases here by my desk, and at <br/>\none point she stopped and thanked me for having so many good books <br/>\naround, saying that it was like having her own private library to <br/>\ncome to when she wanted to know something.
