Horowitz<br/>\n<br/>\nHollywood has become to the right what big corporations are to the left.<br/>\nWhen it comes to criticizing popular entertainment, the two targets<br/>\ncoincide, and the differences between left and right dissolve. I vividly<br/>\nremember the ghastly sight of Jesse Jackson and Bill Bennett appearing<br/>\ntogether on CBS’s Face the Nation a decade ago, united in their eagerness to<br/>\nprotect vulnerable youth from cultural pollution.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo new books, one mainly from the right and the other from the left,<br/>\nreflect this bipartisan view of America’s young people as victims of mass<br/>\nculture and mass marketing. But both also contain hints that kids are not<br/>\nempty vessels waiting to be filled with evil desires -- that in fact, they<br/>\nand their parents can counteract the antisocial messages decried by critics<br/>\nlike Jackson and Bennett.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91192,"nextTopicId":91214}}
