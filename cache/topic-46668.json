No one doubts that<br/>\n  people in the region west of Dillingham have seen a very large raptorlike<br/>\n  bird. But biologists and other people familiar with big Alaska birds say<br/>\n  they&#39;re skeptical it&#39;s that big.<br/>\n<br/>\n  A recent sighting of the mystery bird occurred last Thursday morning when<br/>\n  Moses Coupchiak, a 43-year-old heavy equipment operator from Togiak, 40<br/>\n  miles west of Manokotak, saw the bird flying toward him from about two<br/>\n  miles<br/>\n  away as he worked his tractor.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;At first I thought it was one of those old-time Otter planes,&quot; Coupchiak<br/>\n  said. &quot;Instead of continuing toward me, it banked to the left, and that&#39;s<br/>\n  when I noticed it wasn&#39;t a plane.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  The bird was &quot;something huge,&quot; he said. &quot;The wing looks a little wider<br/>\n  than<br/>\n  the Otter&#39;s, maybe as long as the Otter plane.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  The bird flew behind a hill and disappeared. Coupchiak got on the radio<br/>\n  and<br/>\n  warned people in Togiak to tell their children to stay away.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pilot John Bouker said he was highly skeptical of reports of &quot;this great<br/>\n  big<br/>\n  eagle&quot; that is two or three times the size of a bald eagle. &quot;I didn&#39;t put<br/>\n  any thought into it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  But early this week while flying into Manokotak, Bouker, owner of Bristol<br/>\n  Bay Air Service, looked out his left window and 1,000 feet away, saw a<br/>\n  very<br/>\n  big bird.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The people in the plane all saw him,&quot; Bouker said. &quot;He&#39;s huge, he&#39;s<br/>\n  huge,<br/>\n  he&#39;s really, really big.
