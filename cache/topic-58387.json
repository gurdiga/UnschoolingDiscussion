It&#39;s <br/>\nlike some kind of badge of honor.  I don&#39;t understand it but I&#39;ve seen it <br/>\ndozens of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly introduced herself at a little graduation ceremony and said <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m Holly Dodd, I&#39;m eleven years old, and I&#39;m unschooled.&quot;    I cringed.  I <br/>\nneed to ask her to say &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled.&quot;  Because &quot;unschooling&quot; is <br/>\ngibberish to people who barely know what homeschooling is.  It&#39;s jargon from <br/>\nwithin the homeschooling world.  It&#39;s nothing anyone outside who thinks kids <br/>\nshould all be in school need to hear anything about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Here is what I think some are saying about unschooling - that we need to<br/>\ntrust our children in everything, not trust them in everything but math, or<br/>\neverything but feeding themselves, for instance.  It doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nchildren are left totally to their own devices either.  Parents provide an<br/>\nenvironment that includes math/food/etc., and are available to guide and<br/>\nassist their children in using math/food/etc., and trust that children will<br/>\nuse math/food/etc., as they need to without the parent requiring it of them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI like that and I understand it, but I think it goes too far.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what to say about the full-treatment of kid trust, but I think <br/>\nthe food and the TV and chores stuff, while proving a HUGE big point, is <br/>\nbeyond unschooling in a way.  But I have no idea what to call it.  And I <br/>\nthink that sometimes those families who DO go beyond &quot;just unschooling&quot; find <br/>\nunschooling to be easy.  Maybe it&#39;s just a mark you have to overshoot.  Or <br/>\nmaybe when someone sees that learning can work so well, they just know that <br/>\ntrusting their children with other things will work the same simple, <br/>\nwonderful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe it&#39;s that if a child is expected to be a person early, not a kid <br/>\ntil 18, not &quot;preparing for the future,&quot; maybe part of that rich, early <br/>\nacknowledgement of their powerful selfhood involves trusting them with their <br/>\nown lives, while still being entrusted ourselves with shepherding the <br/>\npeaceful, safe unfolding of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a big damned unnamed deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to call it.  It&#39;s swirling around me, and once in a while a <br/>\nphrase jumps out, and it&#39;s not about &quot;school&quot; or education, it&#39;s about <br/>\nempowerment at a deeper level.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Going beyond that, arithmetic and food are things that we use to accomplish<br/>\nour goals in life, but they are not the end goals by themselves.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  But what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Mary Ellen.   The water&#39;s still muddy, but you&#39;re stirring it in a <br/>\ngood place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58296,"nextTopicId":58398}}
