And these attitudes are tied to my ankles like a noisy string <br/>\nof tin cans.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Any comforting words?  Or, perhaps, a virtual kick in the pants? &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t find the original of that, just the really cool responses.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did want to add that I have plans for a page about the problem of book <br/>\nworship.  I love books myself, and I try to fight that snobbery and prejudice <br/>\nwhich is so unfounded about their value over other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/books\">http://sandradodd.com/books</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLook at the bottom.  <br/>\nThat (and it partly embarrasses me) is the image I have on my main <br/>\nunschooling page.  I like the idea.  It&#39;s a colored-up (by me) version of a traditional <br/>\n(I think) piece of art I&#39;ve seen in other versions over my life, of knowledge <br/>\nshown as a tree growing with its roots in and around a book.  I have since I <br/>\nwas a teenager had bookplates with that art from Antioch books (so if I make <br/>\nthis a review maybe I&#39;m not so deeply into copyright violation if it is their <br/>\nspecial art).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand book worship as an early medieval thing, when a book was <br/>\nhandwritten and nobody would bother unless the information contained were <br/>\nextremely valuable.  But nowadays...   that gateway is long gone.  And I know Bible <br/>\nliteralists (some were my relatives) who worship the Bible (King Jame&#39;s <br/>\nVersion) itself as their one physical link to God, and as the literal, actual word of <br/>\nliteral, actual God, as though it were a personalized autograph.  (Brother <br/>\nJohn Quincy: love ya, but I&#39;d kill ya in a heartbeat, God)  [My uncle who was a <br/>\nBaptist preacher was named John Quincy, and he was my dad&#39;s youngest brother, <br/>\nand you probably don&#39;t have to guess hard what my maiden name was.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think that for some people the awe of universities and higher degrees <br/>\nand caps and gowns and of the Bible and of people who can read Greek and Latin, <br/>\nall that gets wadded up in a knot of brain cells that flash &quot;books are <br/>\nawesome&quot; and put all else in shadow. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98640,"nextTopicId":99170}}
