has not only become an issue of power for children but for parents as well .  it is a sad perversion of the parent/child relationship.   there is so much social pressure to &#39;civilize/socialize&#39; your children that children are being forced to exhibit behaviors that have no essential meaning, turning them into &#39;trained animals&#39; (diane&#39;s- I have forced her to before and she  did it). <br/>\n<br/>\n    deepak chopra wrote a book: the seven spiritual laws for parents.   it&#39;s a nice little book about a way <br/>\n    &#39;to keep the innocence flowing.  there&#39;s a lot in this world that can destroy innocence and precious little that can keep it flowing. &#39;   &#39;as parents, then, what we teach our children is no different from what we must keep teaching ourselves.&#39; <br/>\n    the issue of self-esteem does not lay solely in the lap of children, many parents have very low self-esteem making it difficult to love their children because they struggle with loving themselves (this struggle is often expressed by the use of control over ones environment; which often children are seen as, instead of, equal contributing members of the family). <br/>\n<br/>\n    in chopra book he talks about power and sharing in the context of the spiritual development of the self. <br/>\n    &#39;spirituality, the value of the preschool stage is that power is spiritual - only the distortion of power leads to problems.   so rather than try to curb your child&#39;s rush to power, you need to channel it into tasks and challenges that teach balance.&#39;   &#39;in our love for the child, we allow the illusion (of power) to exist, because we want her to grow up a strong, capable person who feels up to any challenge that comes along.   this sense of self-esteem won&#39;t develop if the feeling of being powerful is shut down or repressed at this stage.&#39; <br/>\n    it seems to me that we, as parents, balance the need to protect our children from the world and to protect the world from our children (grabbing, hitting - basic expressions of power &lt;g&gt;).  this balance, within today&#39;s &#39;politically correct&#39; climate (not to say that historically this hasn&#39;t also been the case, for example in the name of religion many injustices have been perpetrated against children, new face, old problem), has been forsaken.  children&#39;s right to develop and acquire the tools that will aid them in finding their own happiness and contentment, is being sacrificed for the good of the group (again another balance to be maintained, but given some time and some suport/faith this balance will happen- the development of the self will naturally be followed by a caring of others, provided the child does get the opportunity to develop self). <br/>\n<br/>\n    chopra goes on to say that giving and sharing (among other attributes) are really acquired around the ages of 5-8, not that children do not experienced these before this time, but giving and sharing are experienced more toward the child rather then from the child (much like the example diane gave of the girl learning to say please because she experienced it rather than was told that it was the &#39;right&#39; thing to do).  chopra says: <br/>\n    &#39;giving is how, at any age, we show that we empathize with needs outside ourselves.  if giving is seen as a loss - i have to give something up so you can have it (illustrated by diane&#39; example of the boy being forced to give up his piece of pottery)  - the spiritual lesson of this stage has not been taught.  giving, in spiritual terms, means &quot; i give to you without loss to me because you are part of me&quot;.   a young child can not fully grasp this idea, but he can feel it.   children don&#39;t just want to share - they love to share.   they feel the warmth that comes from reaching beyond ego boundaries to include another person in their world; no act is more intimate, and therefore no act feels so blissful.&#39; <br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    carolyn&#39;s story of the 18 month old girl is sad for 2 main reasons: first is because the girl is being asked to do something well beyond her years and out of rhythm with her natural development; and second, and equally sad, is that the mother, needing to control her daughter, lacks faith in her child&#39;s ability to develop and grow.  this lack of faith undermines this most primary and critical relation.  we are so lost to our need to appear &#39;on top of it&#39; and to be &#39;doing the right thing&#39;, that we have forgotten that these things have no meaning if the relationship is lost. <br/>\n<br/>\n    a personal example that i can give is the issue of &#39;where the child should sleep&#39;.    our son has always slept with us though he has had his own bed (giving him a choice and a the sense of power to exercise that choice), which we bought when he was around 18 months old.   at that time he choose to sleep in it for about 2 months but then returned to &#39;the big bed&#39; and still sleeps there (he was 4 in sept.).  the commonly accepted practice of, literally, no time in the &#39;parents&#39;, because the child will become too attached and never individuate, has not been a reality for us.  rene&#39; is extremely independent to the point that he virtually potty trained himself, always introduces himself to new people and does not hang on me (in public that is, though at home is another story:) and has not experienced any overly dependent behavior, in fact he is amazingly confident and has a strong sense of who he is.  what he has learned is that his needs will be met, his desires do matter and his happiness is as important as every other member of the family.  the joy and satisfaction i personally experience because of this is more than i could have imaged (or could have &#39;willed&#39; into existence) and this is why i feel great sorrow when parents literally stop themselves from having an opportunity to experience this level of relating by trying to force their children to conform to some pre-set/external concepts of &#39;right and wrong&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\n    -susan <br/>\n    austin,tx</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"McBryan Alignan","from":"McBryan Alignan &lt;clairefree@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kEO-X6ICSMzefuuJZOOLPAIuqtY5d8eKP6vovyXiA7NZXG9uLxSuwHozNYyuiAu25aw8sVaIU6KNk-ufdcaDUom1CBIVI7Vp8F57OPpc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"power, sharing & sense of self","postDate":"945643747","msgId":5358,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDUuNTM1OC45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5357,"nextInTopic":5361,"prevInTime":5357,"nextInTime":5359,"topicId":5357,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Diane McBryan Alignan: Of power, I would like to say - it s really about a solid sense of self - of feeling right.

This, unfirtunately becomes issue if power<br/>\nwhen others/culture begin to destroy/change/shape a self.  At a very<br/>\nyoung age when a self is forming, focus shifts from being oneself - <br/>\n*all of oneself* - to exerting power in order to retain and preserve<br/>\noneself.  That&#39;s load of unjust work for anyone to have to do - each <br/>\nand every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to share something from Erich Fromm.  This is getting<br/>\noff the unschooling topic - but I thought it was very important and<br/>\nI wanted to quickly throw it out there and bounce off of what Susan <br/>\nhad written in her excellent post.<br/>\n<br/>\nErich Fromm wrote:<br/>\nSelfishness is one kind of greediness. (The German word Selbstsucht<br/>\n(addiction to self) very adequately expresses this quality common to all<br/>\nSucht.) Like all greediness, it contains an insatiability, as a<br/>\nconsequence of which there is never any real satisfaction. Greed is a<br/>\nbottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy<br/>\nthe need without ever reaching satisfaction. This leads to the crucial<br/>\npoint: close observation shows that while the selfish person is always<br/>\nanxiously concerned with himself, he is never satisfied, is always<br/>\nrestless, always driven by the fear of not getting enough, of missing<br/>\nsomething, of being deprived of something. He is filled with burning<br/>\nenvy of anyone who might have more. If we observe still closer,<br/>\nespecially the unconscious dynamics, we find that this type of person is<br/>\nbasically not fond of himself but deeply dislikes himself. The puzzle in<br/>\nthis seeming contradiction is easy to solve. The selfishness is rooted<br/>\nin this very lack of fondness for oneself. The person who is not fond of<br/>\nhimself, who does not approve of himself, is in a constant anxiety<br/>\nconcerning his own self. He has not the inner security which can exist<br/>\nonly on the basis of genuine fondness and affirmation. He must be<br/>\nconcerned about himself, greedy to get everything for himself, since<br/>\nbasically his own self lacks security and satisfaction. The same holds<br/>\ntrue with the so-called narcissistic person, who is not so much<br/>\noverconcerned with getting things for himself as with admiring himself.<br/>\nWhile on the surface it seems that these persons are very much in love<br/>\nwith themselves, they actually are not fond of themselves, and<br/>\ntheir narcissism - like selfishness - is an overcompensation for the<br/>\nbasic lack of self-love. Freud has pointed out that the narcissistic<br/>\nperson has withdrawn his love from others and turned it toward his own<br/>\nperson. While the first part of this statement is true, the second one<br/>\nis a fallacy. He neither loves others nor himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nErich Fromm also wrote:<br/>\nThe criticism of democratic society should not be that people are too<br/>\nselfish; this is true but it is only a consequence of something else.<br/>\nWhat democracy has not succeeded in is to make the individual love<br/>\nhimself; that is, to have a deep sense of affirmation for his individual<br/>\nself, with all his intellectual, emotional, and sensual potentialities.<br/>\nA puritan-protestant inheritance of self-denial, the necessity of<br/>\nsubordinating the individual to the demands of production and profit<br/>\n[the good of society], have made for conditions from which Fascism could<br/>\nspring. The readiness for submission, the pervert courage which is<br/>\nattracted by the image of war and self-annihilation, is only possible on<br/>\nthe basis of a - largely unconscious - desperation, stifled by martial<br/>\nsongs and shouts for the F�hrer. The individual who has ceased to love<br/>\nhimself is ready to die as well as to kill. The problem of our culture,<br/>\nif it is not to become a fascist one, is not that there is too much<br/>\nselfishness but that there is no self-love. [***&gt;]The aim must be to<br/>\ncreate those conditions which make it possible for the individual to<br/>\nrealize his freedom, not only in a formal sense, but by asserting his<br/>\ntotal personality in his intellectual, emotional, sensual qualities.<br/>\nThis freedom is not the rule of one part of the personality over another<br/>\npart - conscience over nature, Super-Ego over Id - but the integration<br/>\nof the whole personality and the factual expression of all the<br/>\npotentialities of this integrated personality. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe continues:<br/>\nThe problem of selfishness has a particular bearing on psychotherapy.<br/>\nThe neurotic individual often is selfish in the sense that<br/>\nhe is blocked in his relationship to others or overanxious about<br/>\nhimself. This is to be expected since to be neurotic means that<br/>\nthe integration of a strong self has not been achieved successfully. To<br/>\nbe normal certainly does not mean that it has. It means, for the<br/>\nmajority of well-adapted individuals that they have lost their own self<br/>\nat an early age and replaced it completely by a social self offered to<br/>\nthem by society. They have no neurotic conflicts because they<br/>\nthemselves, and, therefore, the discrepancy between their selves and the<br/>\noutside world has disappeared. Often the neurotic person is particularly<br/>\nunselfish, lacking in self-assertion and blocked in following his own<br/>\naims. The reason for this unselfishness is essentially the same as for<br/>\nthe selfishness. What he is practically always lacking is self-love.<br/>\nThis is what he needs to become well. If the neurotic becomes well, he<br/>\ndoes not become normal in the sense of the conforming social self. He<br/>\nsucceeds in realizing his self, which never had been completely lost and<br/>\nfor the preservation of which he was struggling by his neurotic<br/>\nsymptoms. A theory, therefore, as Freud&#39;s on narcissism which<br/>\nrationalizes the cultural pattern of denouncing self-love by identifying<br/>\nit with selfishness, can have but devastating effects therapeutically.<br/>\nIt increases the taboo on self-love. Its effects can only be called<br/>\npositive if the aim of psychotherapy is not to help the individual to be<br/>\nhimself; that is, free, spontaneous and creative - qualities<br/>\nconventionally reserved for artists - but to give up the fight for his<br/>\nself and conform to the cultural pattern peacefully and without the<br/>\nnoise of a neurosis.<br/>\n<br/>\nWritings from Erich Fromm</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thad Martin","from":"Thad Martin &lt;tmartin@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"wnsWx_wnE9EkzsnaeD5T4uyqZHVzDX6QaR_55koU-5A_iiCpokdeT5Yy5g_2viFb7-WwPSfQpaFCj9vMixyV1bIbBEApBUKqbis","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"power, sharing & sense of self","postDate":"945615909","msgId":5357,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDUuNTM1Ny45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5358,"prevInTime":5356,"nextInTime":5358,"topicId":5357,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi, i think this is a very important issue.  it seems, in general, that sharing has not only become an issue of power for children but for parents as well .","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1187679692\">hi,<br/>\n<br/>\ni think this is a very important issue.  it seems, in general, that<br/>\n&#39;sharing&#39;
