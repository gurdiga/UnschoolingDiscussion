The teacher made the mistake of saying, &quot;Throw that in the garbage<br/>\nright now!&quot; and the child went ballistic, throwing chairs around and<br/>\neverything.  She said she wishes she had requested, then given choices if<br/>\nhe refused to cooperate, to have been more respectful.  I have given my<br/>\nchildren choices between a positive or negative behavior, and they will<br/>\npause, and say, &quot;Okay,I choose this.&quot;  I have only done it a few times<br/>\nwhen to have not done it meant not respecting my child.  I would never<br/>\nsay it to my older children, because they already know it is their<br/>\nchoice.  I just wanted them to know that they did not have to only have<br/>\nthe choice of throwing a fit.  I think the clue is in your motive.  Do<br/>\nyou want to control them, then they&#39;ll see through it.  Do you want to<br/>\nshow them you respect them and yourself enough to give a boundary?  They<br/>\nwill feel honored.  Choosing your battles.  Some things are just stupid,<br/>\nand there is no need to get control of a situation.  But at times, the<br/>\nchild is asking for direction or for safe boundaries, because they never<br/>\nlearned them at home in a positive, nurturing environment.  If my husband<br/>\nwere cheating on me, I would respectfully give him the option of leaving<br/>\nthat person behind or of leaving me.  That is because I respect myself,<br/>\nand I respect him.  But if he is leaving his socks on the floor, I will<br/>\njust ask them to pick them up.  If he doesn&#39;t , I leave them there or<br/>\nmove them to his side of the room.  Because it is not a battle worth<br/>\nfighting, even if it does get on my nerves.  If I told him &quot;Get rid of<br/>\nthe socks or else...&quot;  that is stupid.

The other is, if they try and weasel out of something, just<br/>\nsay &quot;Susie, take out the garbage&quot; repeatedly in a calm, distinct and<br/>\npolite manner until they see you&#39;re not going to let it go or bow to<br/>\nthem, and do it.  Something else I remember learning in a program called<br/>\nSecond Step, (I think that is the name), was to give the child a choice. <br/>\nThis really helps teachers in public school who are working with special<br/>\nneeds children (abused, violent backgrounds who do not respond well to<br/>\nthreats).  They would say, &quot;John, will you put the apple in the garbage?&quot;<br/>\n If he&#39;s defiant, the teacher would say, &quot;You have a choice to either put<br/>\nthe apple in the garbage or sit down in the hall, which do you choose?&quot; <br/>\nThat way the child has a feeling of control, so it takes away the need to<br/>\nrebel.  Rebellion is a result of a feeling of powerlessness.  Choice<br/>\ngives the child power.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if any of this helps.  I know it&#39;s a good reminder for me.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TFBp3StbeFWOaArKZSl5BYukH4XRAOnZZQjsSZ5LcOeptSdyJCM6uuHbS4oMywVMaFX7Ii-IafDHB1TgEWfabsi1twfl32ylHn9fSASa","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: choices and growth","postDate":"999797363","msgId":24264,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBHSjkwMDcyNDRLWllKQG10YTYuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":24243,"nextInTopic":24276,"prevInTime":24263,"nextInTime":24265,"topicId":24243,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
