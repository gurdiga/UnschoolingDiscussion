Houses keep us from sleeping under the <br/>\nstars, indoor plumbing keeps us from peeing on trees or digging outhouses, <br/>\nheating systems keep us from huddling together by the fire at night, the <br/>\nelectric light keeps us up past sundown when all diurnal animals are <br/>\nsleeping, refridgeration keeps us from going out to gather our food daily, <br/>\netc. Are we addicted to these things or have we learned to use them for our <br/>\nbenefit?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as our physiology being able to adapt, I would say that man has done <br/>\nnothing but adapt up until now.

Well I say it because it&#39;s true, of course. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrestricted just means that my kids have a choice to watch or not. Casey <br/>\n(9) had a friend sleepover last night. They have the choice to watch TV or <br/>\nnot. This morning they chose to finish a movie they got from the library <br/>\nlast night and then they turned it off. They spent some time painting each <br/>\nother&#39;s nails and now they&#39;re off playing. Later we&#39;re all going to the <br/>\nChildren&#39;s Museum and maybe the park.<br/>\n<br/>\nConor (13) is choosing to sleep in as he does most mornings. That&#39;s because <br/>\nhe&#39;s usually up late listening to books. (I will say that we do ask him to <br/>\nturn off the TV and computer after midnight as it keeps my dh awake.) He&#39;ll <br/>\nprobably get up and either go on the computer or watch a TV show before we <br/>\ngo to the Children&#39;s Museum where he will be volunteering. Later he&#39;ll go <br/>\nbowling with his dad and friends. He has the choice to watch TV all day if <br/>\nhe wants. He thinks these other activities are better today. It&#39;s his <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I say, &quot;Bravo!&quot; if you can do that.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you.
