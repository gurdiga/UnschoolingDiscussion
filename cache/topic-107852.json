","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1096154928\">I am cross posting with slight modifications this from AU, for reasons that<br/>\nare immediately clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The amount of t.v. hasn&#39;t been the problem, but the content.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been the most pronounced incidence of synchronicity that I have yet<br/>\nnoticed on the lists where there have been three mothers posting almost the<br/>\nexact same sentiments on three Unschooling lists, specifically expressing<br/>\nthe same concerns about &quot;limiting to appropriate content&quot; with children of<br/>\nvarying ages, from 2 yo to 6 year olds, to a 10 yo, and a 14 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not really the forum for a lengthy dissertation into the discourses<br/>\nof television comedy, or a dissection of the semiotics of the sitcom as a<br/>\ndepiction of the American family - as entertaining as I would personally<br/>\nfind writing such an essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor is it necessarily as helpful to get into a lengthy &quot;I don&#39;t like show<br/>\nX&quot;...&quot;Oh I like show X a lot&quot; debate - because tastes differ, definitions of<br/>\n&quot;vulgar&quot; or funny differ, and it doesn&#39;t really get any further into the<br/>\nprinciples behind the ideas of choice and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere seem to be two issues in reference to the content of tv programs or<br/>\nmovies. The first is the idea that the content, while not necessarily<br/>\nobjectionable in itself, is too &quot;mature&quot; for the children - either too scary<br/>\nor too sexually explicit seem to the main concerns. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first situation I have found, similarly to what others have reported,<br/>\nthat Jayn is very good at self-care if she starts to become scared of<br/>\nimages, sounds or characters&#39; behavior. She also seems to have developed her<br/>\nown specific coping mechanisms for exploring the scary stuff including fast<br/>\nforwarding, going away for a minute, desensitizing herself with repeated<br/>\ngradual exposures, and role-playing games. I too have learnt the kind of<br/>\nmusic or images that disturb her, and will warn her if a program seems<br/>\nlikely to be scary. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of sexually explicit - and people have different places where<br/>\nthey will become concerned - I have found, again similarly to what others<br/>\nhave reported, that Jayn has zero interest in the sexual or even mere<br/>\nromantic antics of people on tv. She certainly is not seeking it out. If<br/>\nsomething comes on in the course of changing channels or she walks into the<br/>\nother room and something is on, she gets a kind of &quot;that looks stupid&quot;<br/>\nexpression and usually totally ignores it. At around 3, she used to enjoy<br/>\n&quot;Sex and the City&quot; because she liked the pretty dresses and sparkles, and<br/>\nwould just go play with her dolls during any of the incomprehensible to her<br/>\nsexual scenes. Now she just lumps adult themed shows of any kind (eg police<br/>\ndrama) together as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stupid garbage&quot; and asks for Disney channel.<br/>\nIt is only a matter of time before she starts expressing ideas and seeking<br/>\nclarification (her version of asking questions) on the odd sexual scenes she<br/>\nbumps into at times on tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I will add that I believe that she will start seeking out or being<br/>\nattracted to programs with sexual content (of any kind) at the appropriate<br/>\ndevelopmental time when her inner questioning arrives at that place - or to<br/>\nput it conversely, she won&#39;t be interested until and unless she is &quot;ready&quot;<br/>\nto receive that kind of information, coupled with the additional guidance<br/>\nthat I will be able to give her about the level of reality that she is<br/>\nseeing. I try to see every new program as an opportunity for more<br/>\ncommunication between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second issue of concern has to do with the &quot;family values&quot; and behavior<br/>\nand relationships of characters in the shows. I have to agree that both the<br/>\ncharacters and the situations in teen sitcoms and movies often depict values<br/>\nthat are in conflict with the ideas of Unschooling, including lousy<br/>\nparenting, adults as adversarial and dumb simultaneously, and sibling<br/>\nconflict portrayed as normal and acceptable. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever whether these values are going to be genuinely internalized and<br/>\nadopted by our children is another question. I personally doubt it, despite<br/>\nthe experimental forays into these less than charming behaviors our kids<br/>\nsometimes engage in. I am seeing it for the first time - Jayn has started<br/>\ncalling me &quot;stupid head&quot; at odd times - from &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; (movie). I<br/>\nhave Trust that it will get old soon. I also endorse the idea of talking<br/>\nover in a genuine way specific behaviors or ideas, rather than making a<br/>\nnegative assessment of the show your kid loves. (I come and blurt the latter<br/>\nonto the lists instead of onto Jayn). ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from the fact that I doubt that any of us are remotely like any of<br/>\nthese detached, authoritarian or befuddled parents, the biggest, hugest,<br/>\nmost significant difference between our children and 100percent of the kids<br/>\nportrayed on any of these shows is: they are all in mandatory school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese TV children&#39;s primary bonding relationships are shown as being with<br/>\ntheir friends and age peers, and with few exceptions, the majority of their<br/>\ntime is spent in the school hallways, on school related projects, including<br/>\nsome really contrived nonsense, and conversing with each other about school<br/>\nstuff or school people. Additionally, with the one exception of Ren Stevens<br/>\nwho likes it and is a butt of humor for that reason, they seem consider<br/>\nschool a necessary evil. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that these shows portray a heightened and exaggerated depiction of<br/>\nwhat we Unschoolers would consider some of the very real negatives of school<br/>\nas they apply to family life - the appropriation of almost all time with the<br/>\nconcomitant disintegration of close family relationships, the culture of<br/>\npeer approval and cliques and personality labeling (&quot;jocks&quot;, &quot;geeks&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;popular girls&quot;, etc), the separation and fostering of distrust and<br/>\ndisconnection between parents and children, the adult (parent or teacher) as<br/>\nboth incomprehensible and a killjoy even while they are &quot;humorously&quot;<br/>\ninfantile (esp. males), children as directly powerless in the face of school<br/>\nor parental rules so resorting to underhand strategies (hi jinks ensue!<br/>\n:P~~). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe entertainment value of these shows to schooled children, who undoubtedly<br/>\nrecognize themselves to a much greater degree, is likely partly in that very<br/>\nseparation from the parents. The tv kids usually spend almost no time in<br/>\nclass of any kind - more wishful thinking for the schooled kids. It is<br/>\npossible that these tv kids have more personal power and autonomy than the<br/>\nreal children - they certainly will do more outlandish stuff. The didactic<br/>\n&quot;mother knows best in the end&quot; message of most of these shows, is a small<br/>\nprice to pay (I mean for the schooled child viewers) for getting to watch<br/>\npeople make really dumb choices (dumber than they might make irl) and follow<br/>\nthrough the absurd results. I notice that &quot;grounding&quot; is the universal<br/>\npunishment, applied even after the &quot;lesson&quot; has been learned. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that most of our children have much less identification with the<br/>\ncharacters. Maybe they watch this stuff with the same sense of disbelieving<br/>\nastonishment that some of us apply to Jerry Springer, or with the same<br/>\ncuriosity as pausing to view a car wreck or collapsed building. It is the<br/>\nvery &quot;otherness&quot; of these families that makes them interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Jayn what she likes about &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;, her current favorite. I<br/>\ndiscovered that her attraction to the show comes from her enjoyment of<br/>\nRaven&#39;s dress up as odd characters antics, and also she likes Raven&#39;s<br/>\nregular clothing which is heavy on the sparkle, feathers and embroidery. We<br/>\nrecord the programs, and sometimes if one of the other characters is the<br/>\nfeatured story that day, she will ask me to skip over those scenes that do<br/>\nnot include Raven herself. In other words the actual narrative or internal<br/>\n&quot;logic&quot; is irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past Jayn has included shows that I don&#39;t like (for values) in her<br/>\nviewing schedule. Her interest has waned, not because I made any attempt to<br/>\nlimit, but because she received all she needed and her interests matured. We<br/>\nhad lots of conversations about specific moments that I disapproved of,<br/>\nalong the lines of other choices the characters could have made in those<br/>\nmoments.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike schooled kids, our children have the opportunity to continue to have<br/>\nauthentic relationships with us. We can continue to be the first and primary<br/>\nvalues influence in their lives, as well as their strongest safety net,<br/>\nregardless of what tv shows they like. I hope that it is our huge presence<br/>\nin their lives, and willingness to really listen without a hidden agenda,<br/>\nthat will ultimately mitigate any of the experimental &quot;bad&quot; behavior that<br/>\nthey may try on.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
