I just don&#39;t want my kids left with the<br/>\ngeneralization that all  &quot;indians&quot; are going to attack and kill and burn.  Yes,<br/>\nsome did.  Some were like that, but there were others like those in Sarah Noble.<br/>\nI guess it&#39;s just going to take some talking to explain that like all of us....we<br/>\nare all different.

One book you might try is called Thunder from the<br/>\nClear Sky by Marcia Sewall. It is the story of the Wampanoags and the<br/>\nPilgrims, written alternately from a Wampanoag&#39;s viewpoint and that of a<br/>\nPilgrim. It is a picture book, but the language is not always easy. I&#39;m<br/>\nreading it aloud to a 10- and 6-yo, and often stop to explain what the<br/>\nnative American is saying. It&#39;s been good for discussing the<br/>\nmisunderstandings, the good intentions gone awry, racism, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother book set more contemporaneously with Matchlock Gun, but probably too<br/>\nmuch for your young kids, is Indian Captive by Lois Lenski. This is the true<br/>\nstory of the captivity of Mary Jemison, and is pretty tense and scary in<br/>\nparts. She eventually decides to stay with the Seneca who adopt her, so the<br/>\nreader is left with a pretty favorable impression of the native Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura Bush<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura@...\">laura@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.honeypot-hollow.com\">http://www.honeypot-hollow.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve just read The Matchlock Gun.
