In fact, I think you&#39;re supposed to get good and messy with<br/>\nit, too, because it&#39;s like pulling teeth to get them to give you more than 2<br/>\nnapkins, no matter how many burgers you buy!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, the little kiosks that sell food at the bigger train<br/>\nstations, at town fests, etc. always provide at least a little fork-like<br/>\nthing (about 3 inches long) with french fries, and a proper plastic knife<br/>\nand fork for a crepe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Germans think I&#39;m wierd for eating donuts, french fries, etc. with my<br/>\nfingers, even if I try to eat daintily.  (Actually, I think the Germans<br/>\nthink I&#39;m wierd in general.)<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\nback after 4 days vactation and a couple more of chaos.  sheesh, you guys<br/>\nhave been prolific!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60765,"nextTopicId":60781}}
