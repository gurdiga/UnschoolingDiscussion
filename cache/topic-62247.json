Just<br/>\nwondering because you seemed so convincing of how he behaved and then <br/>\nit just<br/>\nseemed to be alright. Was it hard to transition for him or you?&quot;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell......without all the in between posts it&#39;s hard to see the <br/>\ntransisition, but I was also less vocal during the transistion so it <br/>\nneeds some added information anyway.<br/>\nI was quite sure I was right, so posting that I MIGHT be wrong didn&#39;t <br/>\nhappen. I just slowly quit saying &quot;No&quot; and quit trying to make my <br/>\nkids feel bad for watching a lot.<br/>\nI never said &quot;ok, all restrictions off&quot; or anything. I actually think <br/>\nthat can be a bad idea.<br/>\nIt depends.<br/>\nAnyway, yes, the transition was a little hard. I dont&#39; like <br/>\nelectronic noise all the time, I find it invasive and draining. Like <br/>\nmany here, I prefer being outdoors a lot or at least have soothing <br/>\nmusic playing part of the day, NOT tv and video games all the time.<br/>\nSo the transition was harder on me than them of course!<br/>\nMost of the behavior &quot;problems&quot; were reactions to control.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but it was true, because most all of <br/>\nthe behavior disappeared not long after lifting the restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevor can still cop quite an attitude over video games sometimes, <br/>\nget really crabby and not pleasant.<br/>\nBut Mary Gold brought up something last year that helped me see it <br/>\ndifferently.<br/>\nShe mentioned that he may be getting the anger due to trying to solve <br/>\na puzzle he can&#39;t solve and that is frustrating him.<br/>\nThe video games have a lot of puzzles to solve sometimes...heck, I <br/>\nget frustrated very quickly on them, so it made sense. I started <br/>\npaying attention. I asked him about it and he said that only certain <br/>\ngames caused the frustration. And sure enough, it was the ones like <br/>\nZelda in which you have to solve a lot of puzzles to get where you <br/>\nneed to go.<br/>\nSo the frustration was causing the grumpy behavior and once we both <br/>\nrecognized it as that, he was more able to keep things in perspective.<br/>\nI will suggest a break if I see him getting very intense.<br/>\nSometimes he&#39;ll just say that he&#39;s really close to solving the puzzle <br/>\nand he needs to stay on it. OK.<br/>\nSo he proceeds to solve it and he&#39;s alright after that, he feels <br/>\nreally good that he was able to finish it.<br/>\nSometimes he gets so absorbed that he can&#39;t seem to get away from the <br/>\ngame, in spite of everyone else happily playing. But it just doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstress me out the way it used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a lot of burps and fits along the way...heck, I still get <br/>\nfrustrated once in a while and ask them to PLEASE turn that &quot;thing&quot; <br/>\noff!!! They know it overwhelms me after a while, but they are just <br/>\nstarting to be a little more sensitive about it.<br/>\nAFter all, I wasn&#39;t very sensitive to their needs/desires so it takes <br/>\na while to undo all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nA warning to Julie and others that are trying to &quot;deprogram&quot;....<br/>\nDon&#39;t expect anything quickly.<br/>\nMy kids are still VERY absorbed in their video games for long <br/>\nstretches of time (maybe they always will be) but tv is no longer <br/>\nthat big of a deal.<br/>\nThey have certain shows they watch and they no longer sit and just <br/>\nwatch anything that&#39;s on just to be watching....though we went <br/>\nthrough that too.<br/>\nDon&#39;t just sit back and wait for them to self regulate. Watch WITH <br/>\nthem, offer other options, be part of their world. That made the <br/>\nbiggest difference in our lives.<br/>\nFor a while I just kept holding my breath, waiting for the novelty to <br/>\nwear off. It did to some degree, but they were still watching SO much.<br/>\nFinally, the advice here about getting into their interests clicked <br/>\nwith me.<br/>\nTheir interests included a LOT of tv and video games. I was not <br/>\nentering into that particular interest!! How could I have been so <br/>\nblind?<br/>\nI started watching a lot of the Japanese anime with them, it was <br/>\nactually really cool! I started looking stuff up on the internet and <br/>\nforwarding it to Trevor.<br/>\nNow we have some common ground. It changed everything. I am no longer <br/>\nthe &quot;enemy&quot; trying to keep them from what they want. I just never had <br/>\nbeen able to bridge my unschooling philosophies over the certain <br/>\nareas of our lives. But once I did (ok, I still say some stupid <br/>\nthings) it changed our entire family dynamics, changed our <br/>\ninteractions and the trust level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when people say it just won&#39;t work for their families, of course I <br/>\nam very stubborn. I KNOW it will  work if the parents want it to.<br/>\nI KNOW it will lead to better relationships, more learning <br/>\nopportunities and such.<br/>\nIf I know these things, it is my responsibility to share them with <br/>\nyou.<br/>\nJust like other people here shared with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nA home where the parents are controlling ANY information or interests <br/>\nis not as happy, bubbly and joyful as a home where that isn&#39;t <br/>\nhappening.

Some of it wasn&#39;t true (like about me not being a tv addict, I<br/>\nfailed<br/>\n&gt; to mention that I WAS one when I first owned a tv) but I felt the need to<br/>\n&gt; defend my beliefs against the WISE words of Anne, Joyce and<br/>\nSandra....others<br/>\n&gt; too.<br/>\n&gt; So what follows is only MY posts, over a very long conversation about tv.<br/>\n&gt; You can imagine what the other ones were like, similar to the issues<br/>\n&gt; discussed here recently.

I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in<br/>\n&gt; perspective<br/>\n&gt; and prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly<br/>\n&gt; entertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from<br/>\n&gt; each of<br/>\n&gt; these, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the<br/>\n&gt; amount of<br/>\n&gt; time we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; part of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; the chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to<br/>\n&gt; sit and<br/>\n&gt; veg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family.<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; kids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those<br/>\n&gt; days<br/>\n&gt; where I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time<br/>\n&gt; everything<br/>\n&gt; seems to fall apart.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Sunday, June 17, 2001 - 11:28 pm:<br/>\n&gt; I guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; good and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; that if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; works for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that<br/>\n&gt; technology<br/>\n&gt; has many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on<br/>\n&gt; it...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times<br/>\n&gt; but if<br/>\n&gt; I let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a<br/>\n&gt; row<br/>\n&gt; with no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel<br/>\n&gt; better<br/>\n&gt; and enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come<br/>\n&gt; outside<br/>\n&gt; and play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental<br/>\n&gt; experience<br/>\n&gt; comes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; show growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as<br/>\n&gt; too much<br/>\n&gt; control but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; negative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of<br/>\n&gt; contact with<br/>\n&gt; family members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; telling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us.<br/>\n&gt; There<br/>\n&gt; are numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per<br/>\n&gt; day is<br/>\n&gt; detrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel<br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but<br/>\n&gt; the tv.<br/>\n&gt; And too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not<br/>\n&gt; fun<br/>\n&gt; to be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; became &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was<br/>\n&gt; always reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or<br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; else to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the<br/>\n&gt; earth, with<br/>\n&gt; the animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to<br/>\n&gt; me that<br/>\n&gt; my children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the<br/>\n&gt; opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; learn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; watch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time<br/>\n&gt; spent<br/>\n&gt; doing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Monday, June 18, 2001 - 04:10 pm:<br/>\n&gt; I think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; the tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you<br/>\n&gt; must,<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the<br/>\n&gt; Indians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; No, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about<br/>\n&gt; being<br/>\n&gt; in touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing<br/>\n&gt; ourselves in<br/>\n&gt; excess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; board applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; choose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a<br/>\n&gt; connection<br/>\n&gt; to her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot;<br/>\n&gt; any more<br/>\n&gt; than we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; makes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; me...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor<br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; it turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our<br/>\n&gt; house?<br/>\n&gt; Would that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as<br/>\n&gt; necessary<br/>\n&gt; to a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view<br/>\n&gt; videos<br/>\n&gt; and have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one<br/>\n&gt; for 6<br/>\n&gt; months last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; past (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people<br/>\n&gt; faced not<br/>\n&gt; so long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; deprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the<br/>\n&gt; studies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to<br/>\n&gt; account. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have<br/>\n&gt; neglectful<br/>\n&gt; parents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of<br/>\n&gt; the tv<br/>\n&gt; most of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from<br/>\n&gt; sitting<br/>\n&gt; in front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only<br/>\n&gt; point<br/>\n&gt; before was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing<br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; things, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; that. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes,<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; may mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that<br/>\n&gt; area<br/>\n&gt; over to them and that is a good thing for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>\n&gt; The topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the<br/>\n&gt; time her<br/>\n&gt; son spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we<br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; (which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no<br/>\n&gt; worry<br/>\n&gt; about it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very<br/>\n&gt; valuable<br/>\n&gt; even if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with<br/>\n&gt; some of<br/>\n&gt; you, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic<br/>\n&gt; games, tv<br/>\n&gt; you name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; mother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga,<br/>\n&gt; paints,<br/>\n&gt; teaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!!<br/>\n&gt; And yet,<br/>\n&gt; if I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it<br/>\n&gt; every<br/>\n&gt; time. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned<br/>\n&gt; that I<br/>\n&gt; would like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it<br/>\n&gt; limited<br/>\n&gt; because he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be<br/>\n&gt; willing<br/>\n&gt; to up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example<br/>\n&gt; does<br/>\n&gt; rub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all<br/>\n&gt; day<br/>\n&gt; every day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; you have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well.<br/>\n&gt; But<br/>\n&gt; their are different kids with different personalities and each of us<br/>\n&gt; has to<br/>\n&gt; find what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is<br/>\n&gt; equally<br/>\n&gt; affected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very<br/>\n&gt; addictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very<br/>\n&gt; obvious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 11:48 pm:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; get to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy<br/>\n&gt; in the<br/>\n&gt; house to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row<br/>\n&gt; with no<br/>\n&gt; control and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all<br/>\n&gt; kids are<br/>\n&gt; like that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he<br/>\n&gt; has had<br/>\n&gt; long binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he<br/>\n&gt; completes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on<br/>\n&gt; time and<br/>\n&gt; make sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is<br/>\n&gt; free<br/>\n&gt; to choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as<br/>\n&gt; and as<br/>\n&gt; often as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For<br/>\n&gt; most kids<br/>\n&gt; maybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days<br/>\n&gt; playing<br/>\n&gt; Nintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; mean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He<br/>\n&gt; is not<br/>\n&gt; usually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding<br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; and it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; mind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; it, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; let them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor<br/>\n&gt; time&quot; but<br/>\n&gt; I do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin<br/>\n&gt; fever...LOL.<br/>\n&gt; Usually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all<br/>\n&gt; together...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time<br/>\n&gt; down<br/>\n&gt; there with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida<br/>\n&gt; mosquitoes!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Wednesday, June 20, 2001 - 10:51 am:<br/>\n&gt; I appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me<br/>\n&gt; think. I<br/>\n&gt; am personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any<br/>\n&gt; kind, we<br/>\n&gt; are very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our<br/>\n&gt; money on<br/>\n&gt; travel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it<br/>\n&gt; himself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy<br/>\n&gt; the new<br/>\n&gt; Zelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from<br/>\n&gt; it...that<br/>\n&gt; is definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that<br/>\n&gt; tends to<br/>\n&gt; get grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and<br/>\n&gt; needs<br/>\n&gt; to move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot,<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; his way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; could care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; different souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for<br/>\n&gt; limiting<br/>\n&gt; it, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is<br/>\n&gt; appropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; order and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is<br/>\n&gt; an<br/>\n&gt; ongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen.<br/>\n&gt; Obviously he<br/>\n&gt; knows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; taught<br/>\n&gt; me a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; wants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting<br/>\n&gt; irritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we<br/>\n&gt; had a<br/>\n&gt; little converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; agreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I<br/>\n&gt; know how<br/>\n&gt; obsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A<br/>\n&gt; not so<br/>\n&gt; good trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me<br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; that day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I<br/>\n&gt; agree<br/>\n&gt; that we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my<br/>\n&gt; son.<br/>\n&gt; And we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s why<br/>\n&gt; he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; different rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to do here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Thursday, June 21, 2001 - 05:25 pm:<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different<br/>\n&gt; unschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; &quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; concept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are<br/>\n&gt; indeed<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I<br/>\n&gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; what you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage<br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; and teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against<br/>\n&gt; well-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you.<br/>\n&gt; But I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining<br/>\n&gt; why I<br/>\n&gt; do it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of<br/>\n&gt; this...I just expect certain things done before we do other<br/>\n&gt; activities--helps<br/>\n&gt; me be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another<br/>\n&gt; person but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; point but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it<br/>\n&gt; open.<br/>\n&gt; There are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different<br/>\n&gt; people,<br/>\n&gt; with different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; messing with it...LOL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Friday, June 29, 2001 - 04:26 pm:<br/>\n&gt; I too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this<br/>\n&gt; hasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; D___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have<br/>\n&gt; found<br/>\n&gt; that my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; need a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they<br/>\n&gt; really want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; alone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; views and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; actually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he<br/>\n&gt; showed me a<br/>\n&gt; bunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; questioning<br/>\n&gt; my motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another<br/>\n&gt; activity,<br/>\n&gt; like they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 03:28 pm:<br/>\n&gt; well I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to<br/>\n&gt; be any<br/>\n&gt; different..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs<br/>\n&gt; over it.<br/>\n&gt; I have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out<br/>\n&gt; first. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and<br/>\n&gt; ready<br/>\n&gt; to help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on<br/>\n&gt; very<br/>\n&gt; little control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has<br/>\n&gt; spent<br/>\n&gt; three full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for<br/>\n&gt; it. How<br/>\n&gt; long do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not<br/>\n&gt; agree<br/>\n&gt; with sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your<br/>\n&gt; words<br/>\n&gt; (Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out<br/>\n&gt; before I<br/>\n&gt; intervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some<br/>\n&gt; games<br/>\n&gt; put him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere<br/>\n&gt; you want<br/>\n&gt; and work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; learning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; also.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 07:31 pm:<br/>\n&gt; Yeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the<br/>\n&gt; problem is<br/>\n&gt; living in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; private spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug<br/>\n&gt; me so<br/>\n&gt; much. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and<br/>\n&gt; figure<br/>\n&gt; out what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; with our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his<br/>\n&gt; insights on<br/>\n&gt; the issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant<br/>\n&gt; change<br/>\n&gt; for sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; way he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly<br/>\n&gt; spending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; whatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting<br/>\n&gt; again....something<br/>\n&gt; I sure wish I had learned at a young age.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; are very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a<br/>\n&gt; triathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid<br/>\n&gt; LOVES swim<br/>\n&gt; team and goes to practice every day of the week with very few<br/>\n&gt; exceptions...so<br/>\n&gt; relax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a<br/>\n&gt; waste<br/>\n&gt; of time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not<br/>\n&gt; sure how<br/>\n&gt; comfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; comfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a<br/>\n&gt; considerable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with<br/>\n&gt; household stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is<br/>\n&gt; helping them<br/>\n&gt; feel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling<br/>\n&gt; over<br/>\n&gt; all...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any<br/>\n&gt; promises<br/>\n&gt; here. Just trying to find the balance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By ren on Monday, August 6, 2001 - 03:15 am:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; ok to<br/>\n&gt; limit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not<br/>\n&gt; interested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything.<br/>\n&gt; If I<br/>\n&gt; say &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is<br/>\n&gt; usually<br/>\n&gt; glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to<br/>\n&gt; watch I<br/>\n&gt; just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and he<br/>\n&gt; always is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; think there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it<br/>\n&gt; than<br/>\n&gt; others. I just disagree with total self regulation on that<br/>\n&gt; topic....sorry. I<br/>\n&gt; do believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self<br/>\n&gt; regulation<br/>\n&gt; works for all of you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By ren on Friday, August 10, 2001 - 08:10 pm:<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of<br/>\n&gt; veggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the<br/>\n&gt; junk. The<br/>\n&gt; key to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; have healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; junk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my<br/>\n&gt; neices/nephews.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; they will balance it all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By ren on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 - 10:39 am:<br/>\n&gt; The first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; enough time to deschool&quot;....<br/>\n&gt; It took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; that. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of<br/>\n&gt; inventiveness I hadn&#39;t before.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; writing. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10<br/>\n&gt; times 5<br/>\n&gt; last night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you<br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; what? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; touch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to<br/>\n&gt; write or<br/>\n&gt; do math equations.<br/>\n&gt; Keep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work.<br/>\n&gt; I totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot;<br/>\n&gt; enough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and<br/>\n&gt; a new<br/>\n&gt; baby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad<br/>\n&gt; nightly<br/>\n&gt; in Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical<br/>\n&gt; thinking,<br/>\n&gt; reading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides<br/>\n&gt; etc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday<br/>\n&gt; (complete<br/>\n&gt; with decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in<br/>\n&gt; any<br/>\n&gt; way. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house,<br/>\n&gt; watching tv and just hanging out too.<br/>\n&gt; Your girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever<br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; seen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important<br/>\n&gt; things<br/>\n&gt; about their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of<br/>\n&gt; daily<br/>\n&gt; living and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are<br/>\n&gt; absorbing all of that.<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By ren on Thursday, October 4, 2001 - 11:10 am:<br/>\n&gt; Having formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; choose I can relate to both sides of this issue.<br/>\n&gt; I have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; to come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere<br/>\n&gt; today. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy)<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; being very social. Like down time for them.<br/>\n&gt; I have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; more relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that<br/>\n&gt; &quot;forbidden<br/>\n&gt; fruit&quot; thing!<br/>\n&gt; There is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and<br/>\n&gt; saying<br/>\n&gt; &quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 10:14 am:<br/>\n&gt; I had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv.<br/>\n&gt; I got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints<br/>\n&gt; in this<br/>\n&gt; very forum not too long ago.<br/>\n&gt; That annoyed feeling made me think though.<br/>\n&gt; It made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!!<br/>\n&gt; COULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control?<br/>\n&gt; Was I hindering their world in some way?<br/>\n&gt; I finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE.<br/>\n&gt; My children have a right to choose their own life.<br/>\n&gt; And they have now.<br/>\n&gt; Trevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; the new cable we had installed.<br/>\n&gt; Better now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on<br/>\n&gt; his own<br/>\n&gt; imo.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire<br/>\n&gt; household.<br/>\n&gt; Now that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really<br/>\n&gt; enjoyed<br/>\n&gt; some wonderful moments as a family.<br/>\n&gt; My kids have learned a TON from it.<br/>\n&gt; I just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the<br/>\n&gt; learning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it.<br/>\n&gt; To me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to<br/>\n&gt; shun one<br/>\n&gt; tool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; offer.<br/>\n&gt; All of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above?<br/>\n&gt; Can you believe that we have that AND a telly?<br/>\n&gt; Hmmm....<br/>\n&gt; The television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool.<br/>\n&gt; You can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over<br/>\n&gt; your life<br/>\n&gt; unless you want it to.<br/>\n&gt; Some of these responses make me wonder if people think television is<br/>\n&gt; akin to<br/>\n&gt; smoking and causes addiction.<br/>\n&gt; Why would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; spouses or listen to them 100%?<br/>\n&gt; Do you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a<br/>\n&gt; conversation?<br/>\n&gt; I find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; effective<br/>\n&gt; communication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh.<br/>\n&gt; And insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion.<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; By Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 03:31 pm:<br/>\n&gt; . &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then it won&#39;t work.<br/>\n&gt; You can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking<br/>\n&gt; about.<br/>\n&gt; Only total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; forum.<br/>\n&gt; You will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; candy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control<br/>\n&gt; yet)<br/>\n&gt; and you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; It only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always<br/>\n&gt; there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning<br/>\n&gt; that is<br/>\n&gt; available through television because of what I view as the negative<br/>\n&gt; aspects<br/>\n&gt; of it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative<br/>\n&gt; aspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; seen<br/>\n&gt; this repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be<br/>\n&gt; entertained &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative<br/>\n&gt; things on<br/>\n&gt; television, you will shut down the positive aspects of it?<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are<br/>\n&gt; negative.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot;<br/>\n&gt; ???<br/>\n&gt; Really? Well, that is not true in my house.<br/>\n&gt; My 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative,<br/>\n&gt; prefers<br/>\n&gt; to daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw.<br/>\n&gt; He has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his<br/>\n&gt; creativity abound.<br/>\n&gt; He is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have<br/>\n&gt; a 12<br/>\n&gt; y.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; while.......<br/>\n&gt; I suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view.<br/>\n&gt; Kids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area.<br/>\n&gt; Everything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited.<br/>\n&gt; Of course their creativity is stifled.<br/>\n&gt; And independant play is not necessarily a good thing.<br/>\n&gt; Some people need more person to person interaction, others are more<br/>\n&gt; introverted.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with<br/>\n&gt; preschoolers.<br/>\n&gt; Independance is overrated.<br/>\n&gt; Interdependance is much healthier.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; watch that much. &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to<br/>\n&gt; person.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer.<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; school ideas into their lives.<br/>\n&gt; I suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the<br/>\n&gt; better way.<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.

I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in <br/>\nperspective <br/>\nand prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly <br/>\nentertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from <br/>\neach of <br/>\nthese, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the <br/>\namount of <br/>\ntime we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids <br/>\nbe <br/>\npart of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only <br/>\nafter <br/>\nthe chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to <br/>\nsit and <br/>\nveg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family. <br/>\nThe <br/>\nkids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those <br/>\ndays <br/>\nwhere I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time <br/>\neverything <br/>\nseems to fall apart. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Sunday, June 17, 2001 - 11:28 pm:<br/>\nI guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it <br/>\nis <br/>\ngood and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you <br/>\ndo <br/>\nthat if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do <br/>\nwhat <br/>\nworks for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that <br/>\ntechnology <br/>\nhas many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on <br/>\nit...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times <br/>\nbut if <br/>\nI let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a <br/>\nrow <br/>\nwith no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel <br/>\nbetter <br/>\nand enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come <br/>\noutside <br/>\nand play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental <br/>\nexperience <br/>\ncomes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as <br/>\nthey <br/>\nshow growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as <br/>\ntoo much <br/>\ncontrol but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is <br/>\nnot <br/>\nnegative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of <br/>\ncontact with <br/>\nfamily members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m <br/>\nnot <br/>\ntelling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us. <br/>\nThere <br/>\nare numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per <br/>\nday is <br/>\ndetrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel <br/>\nlike <br/>\nit&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but <br/>\nthe tv. <br/>\nAnd too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not <br/>\nfun <br/>\nto be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone <br/>\nthat <br/>\nbecame &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was <br/>\nalways reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or <br/>\nsomething <br/>\nelse to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the <br/>\nearth, with <br/>\nthe animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to <br/>\nme that <br/>\nmy children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the <br/>\nopportunity to <br/>\nlearn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this <br/>\nand <br/>\nwatch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time <br/>\nspent <br/>\ndoing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works <br/>\nfor <br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Monday, June 18, 2001 - 04:10 pm:<br/>\nI think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to <br/>\nhave <br/>\nthe tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you <br/>\nmust, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the <br/>\nIndians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of <br/>\nit. <br/>\nNo, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about <br/>\nbeing <br/>\nin touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing <br/>\nourselves in <br/>\nexcess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across <br/>\nthe <br/>\nboard applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason <br/>\nI <br/>\nchoose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a <br/>\nconnection <br/>\nto her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot; <br/>\nany more <br/>\nthan we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat <br/>\nmakes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire <br/>\non <br/>\nme...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nthink so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor <br/>\ndid <br/>\nit turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our <br/>\nhouse? <br/>\nWould that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as <br/>\nnecessary <br/>\nto a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view <br/>\nvideos <br/>\nand have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one <br/>\nfor 6 <br/>\nmonths last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in <br/>\nthe <br/>\npast (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people <br/>\nfaced not <br/>\nso long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nthat <br/>\ndeprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the <br/>\nstudies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to <br/>\naccount. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have <br/>\nneglectful <br/>\nparents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of <br/>\nthe tv <br/>\nmost of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from <br/>\nsitting <br/>\nin front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only <br/>\npoint <br/>\nbefore was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing <br/>\nthese <br/>\nthings, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthat. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes, <br/>\nthat <br/>\nmay mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that <br/>\narea <br/>\nover to them and that is a good thing for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>\nThe topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the <br/>\ntime her <br/>\nson spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we <br/>\nwould <br/>\n(which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no <br/>\nworry <br/>\nabout it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very <br/>\nvaluable <br/>\neven if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with <br/>\nsome of <br/>\nyou, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic <br/>\ngames, tv <br/>\nyou name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am <br/>\na <br/>\nmother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga, <br/>\npaints, <br/>\nteaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!! <br/>\nAnd yet, <br/>\nif I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it <br/>\nevery <br/>\ntime. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned <br/>\nthat I <br/>\nwould like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it <br/>\nlimited <br/>\nbecause he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be <br/>\nwilling <br/>\nto up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example <br/>\ndoes <br/>\nrub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all <br/>\nday <br/>\nevery day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot <br/>\nof <br/>\nyou have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well. <br/>\nBut <br/>\ntheir are different kids with different personalities and each of us <br/>\nhas to <br/>\nfind what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is <br/>\nequally <br/>\naffected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very <br/>\naddictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very <br/>\nobvious. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 11:48 pm:<br/>\nI&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let <br/>\nhim <br/>\nget to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy <br/>\nin the <br/>\nhouse to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row <br/>\nwith no <br/>\ncontrol and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all <br/>\nkids are <br/>\nlike that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he <br/>\nhas had <br/>\nlong binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he <br/>\ncompletes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on <br/>\ntime and <br/>\nmake sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is <br/>\nfree <br/>\nto choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nsee that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as <br/>\nand as <br/>\noften as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For <br/>\nmost kids <br/>\nmaybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days <br/>\nplaying <br/>\nNintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but <br/>\nbe <br/>\nmean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He <br/>\nis not <br/>\nusually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding <br/>\nthings <br/>\nand it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in <br/>\nmy <br/>\nmind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any <br/>\nof <br/>\nit, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness <br/>\nto <br/>\nlet them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor <br/>\ntime&quot; but <br/>\nI do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin <br/>\nfever...LOL. <br/>\nUsually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all <br/>\ntogether...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time <br/>\ndown <br/>\nthere with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida <br/>\nmosquitoes!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Wednesday, June 20, 2001 - 10:51 am:<br/>\nI appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me <br/>\nthink. I <br/>\nam personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any <br/>\nkind, we <br/>\nare very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our <br/>\nmoney on <br/>\ntravel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it <br/>\nhimself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy <br/>\nthe new <br/>\nZelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from <br/>\nit...that <br/>\nis definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that <br/>\ntends to <br/>\nget grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and <br/>\nneeds <br/>\nto move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot, <br/>\njust <br/>\nhis way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv <br/>\nand <br/>\ncould care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are <br/>\njust <br/>\ndifferent souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better <br/>\nwhen <br/>\nhe&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for <br/>\nlimiting <br/>\nit, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is <br/>\nappropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is <br/>\nin <br/>\norder and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is <br/>\nan <br/>\nongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen. <br/>\nObviously he <br/>\nknows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s <br/>\ntaught <br/>\nme a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game <br/>\nhe <br/>\nwants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting <br/>\nirritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we <br/>\nhad a <br/>\nlittle converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough <br/>\nand I <br/>\nagreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I <br/>\nknow how <br/>\nobsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A <br/>\nnot so <br/>\ngood trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me <br/>\nsomething <br/>\nthat day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I <br/>\nagree <br/>\nthat we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my <br/>\nson. <br/>\nAnd we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe <br/>\nthat&#39;s why <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults <br/>\nhave <br/>\ndifferent rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to do here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Thursday, June 21, 2001 - 05:25 pm:<br/>\nI think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different <br/>\nunschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make <br/>\nthem <br/>\n&quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand <br/>\nthe <br/>\nconcept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are <br/>\nindeed <br/>\nunschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I <br/>\nunderstand <br/>\nwhat you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage <br/>\npeople <br/>\nand teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against <br/>\nwell-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you. <br/>\nBut I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining <br/>\nwhy I <br/>\ndo it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of <br/>\nthis...I just expect certain things done before we do other <br/>\nactivities--helps <br/>\nme be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another <br/>\nperson but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at <br/>\nsome <br/>\npoint but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it <br/>\nopen. <br/>\nThere are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different <br/>\npeople, <br/>\nwith different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not <br/>\nmessing with it...LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Friday, June 29, 2001 - 04:26 pm:<br/>\nI too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this <br/>\nhasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of <br/>\nthe <br/>\nD___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have <br/>\nfound <br/>\nthat my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they <br/>\njust <br/>\nneed a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they <br/>\nreally want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving <br/>\nit <br/>\nalone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about <br/>\nmy <br/>\nviews and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I <br/>\nwas <br/>\nactually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he <br/>\nshowed me a <br/>\nbunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m <br/>\nquestioning <br/>\nmy motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another <br/>\nactivity, <br/>\nlike they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 03:28 pm:<br/>\nwell I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to <br/>\nbe any <br/>\ndifferent..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs <br/>\nover it. <br/>\nI have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out <br/>\nfirst. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and <br/>\nready <br/>\nto help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on <br/>\nvery <br/>\nlittle control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has <br/>\nspent <br/>\nthree full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for <br/>\nit. How <br/>\nlong do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not <br/>\nagree <br/>\nwith sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your <br/>\nwords <br/>\n(Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out <br/>\nbefore I <br/>\nintervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some <br/>\ngames <br/>\nput him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time <br/>\nand <br/>\nit&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere <br/>\nyou want <br/>\nand work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So <br/>\nwe&#39;re <br/>\nlearning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv <br/>\non <br/>\nalso. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 07:31 pm:<br/>\nYeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the <br/>\nproblem is <br/>\nliving in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nprivate spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug <br/>\nme so <br/>\nmuch. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and <br/>\nfigure <br/>\nout what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to <br/>\ndo <br/>\nwith our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his <br/>\ninsights on <br/>\nthe issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but <br/>\nhe <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant <br/>\nchange <br/>\nfor sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal <br/>\nthe <br/>\nway he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly <br/>\nspending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide <br/>\nand <br/>\nwhatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting <br/>\nagain....something <br/>\nI sure wish I had learned at a young age. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh <br/>\nand I <br/>\nare very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a <br/>\ntriathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid <br/>\nLOVES swim <br/>\nteam and goes to practice every day of the week with very few <br/>\nexceptions...so <br/>\nrelax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a <br/>\nwaste <br/>\nof time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not <br/>\nsure how <br/>\ncomfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not <br/>\ncomfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a <br/>\nconsiderable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with <br/>\nhousehold stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is <br/>\nhelping them <br/>\nfeel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling <br/>\nover <br/>\nall...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any <br/>\npromises <br/>\nhere. Just trying to find the balance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Monday, August 6, 2001 - 03:15 am:<br/>\nI&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s <br/>\nok to <br/>\nlimit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not <br/>\ninterested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything. <br/>\nIf I <br/>\nsay &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is <br/>\nusually <br/>\nglad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to <br/>\nwatch I <br/>\njust say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot; <br/>\nand he <br/>\nalways is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but <br/>\nI <br/>\nthink there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it <br/>\nthan <br/>\nothers. I just disagree with total self regulation on that <br/>\ntopic....sorry. I <br/>\ndo believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self <br/>\nregulation <br/>\nworks for all of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Friday, August 10, 2001 - 08:10 pm:<br/>\nOk, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of <br/>\nveggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the <br/>\njunk. The <br/>\nkey to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if <br/>\nyou <br/>\nhave healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as <br/>\nthe <br/>\njunk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my <br/>\nneices/nephews. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the <br/>\nmore <br/>\nthey will balance it all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy ren on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 - 10:39 am:<br/>\nThe first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t <br/>\nhad <br/>\nenough time to deschool&quot;.... <br/>\nIt took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior <br/>\nto <br/>\nthat. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of <br/>\ninventiveness I hadn&#39;t before. <br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons <br/>\nor <br/>\nwriting. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10 <br/>\ntimes 5 <br/>\nlast night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you <br/>\nknow <br/>\nwhat? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being <br/>\nin <br/>\ntouch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to <br/>\nwrite or <br/>\ndo math equations. <br/>\nKeep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work. <br/>\nI totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot; <br/>\nenough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and <br/>\na new <br/>\nbaby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an <br/>\nunschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad <br/>\nnightly <br/>\nin Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical <br/>\nthinking, <br/>\nreading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides <br/>\netc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday <br/>\n(complete <br/>\nwith decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in <br/>\nany <br/>\nway. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house, <br/>\nwatching tv and just hanging out too. <br/>\nYour girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever <br/>\neven <br/>\nseen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important <br/>\nthings <br/>\nabout their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of <br/>\ndaily <br/>\nliving and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are <br/>\nabsorbing all of that. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Thursday, October 4, 2001 - 11:10 am:<br/>\nHaving formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting <br/>\nthem <br/>\nchoose I can relate to both sides of this issue. <br/>\nI have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I <br/>\nhave <br/>\nto come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere <br/>\ntoday. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy) <br/>\nafter <br/>\nbeing very social. Like down time for them. <br/>\nI have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that <br/>\nI&#39;m <br/>\nmore relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that <br/>\n&quot;forbidden <br/>\nfruit&quot; thing! <br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and <br/>\nsaying <br/>\n&quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 10:14 am:<br/>\nI had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv. <br/>\nI got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints <br/>\nin this <br/>\nvery forum not too long ago. <br/>\nThat annoyed feeling made me think though. <br/>\nIt made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!! <br/>\nCOULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control? <br/>\nWas I hindering their world in some way? <br/>\nI finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE. <br/>\nMy children have a right to choose their own life. <br/>\nAnd they have now. <br/>\nTrevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthe new cable we had installed. <br/>\nBetter now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on <br/>\nhis own <br/>\nimo. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire <br/>\nhousehold. <br/>\nNow that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really <br/>\nenjoyed <br/>\nsome wonderful moments as a family. <br/>\nMy kids have learned a TON from it. <br/>\nI just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the <br/>\nlearning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it. <br/>\nTo me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to <br/>\nshun one <br/>\ntool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool <br/>\ncan&#39;t <br/>\noffer. <br/>\nAll of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above? <br/>\nCan you believe that we have that AND a telly? <br/>\nHmmm.... <br/>\nThe television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool. <br/>\nYou can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over <br/>\nyour life <br/>\nunless you want it to. <br/>\nSome of these responses make me wonder if people think television is <br/>\nakin to <br/>\nsmoking and causes addiction. <br/>\nWhy would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nspouses or listen to them 100%? <br/>\nDo you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a <br/>\nconversation? <br/>\nI find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have <br/>\neffective <br/>\ncommunication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh. <br/>\nAnd insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 03:31 pm:<br/>\n. &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThen it won&#39;t work. <br/>\nYou can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking <br/>\nabout. <br/>\nOnly total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in <br/>\nthis <br/>\nforum. <br/>\nYou will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick <br/>\non <br/>\ncandy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control <br/>\nyet) <br/>\nand you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot; <br/>\nIt only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always <br/>\nthere. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning <br/>\nthat is <br/>\navailable through television because of what I view as the negative <br/>\naspects <br/>\nof it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative <br/>\naspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen <br/>\nthis repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be <br/>\nentertained &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative <br/>\nthings on <br/>\ntelevision, you will shut down the positive aspects of it? <br/>\nThat&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are <br/>\nnegative. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot; <br/>\n??? <br/>\nReally? Well, that is not true in my house. <br/>\nMy 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative, <br/>\nprefers <br/>\nto daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw. <br/>\nHe has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his <br/>\ncreativity abound. <br/>\nHe is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have <br/>\na 12 <br/>\ny.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for <br/>\na <br/>\nwhile....... <br/>\nI suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view. <br/>\nKids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area. <br/>\nEverything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited. <br/>\nOf course their creativity is stifled. <br/>\nAnd independant play is not necessarily a good thing. <br/>\nSome people need more person to person interaction, others are more <br/>\nintroverted. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with <br/>\npreschoolers. <br/>\nIndependance is overrated. <br/>\nInterdependance is much healthier. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nwatch that much. &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to <br/>\nperson. <br/>\nI&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer. <br/>\nHomeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree. <br/>\nThat&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot <br/>\nof <br/>\nschool ideas into their lives. <br/>\nI suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the <br/>\nbetter way. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.

I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in <br/>\nperspective <br/>\nand prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly <br/>\nentertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from <br/>\neach of <br/>\nthese, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the <br/>\namount of <br/>\ntime we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids <br/>\nbe <br/>\npart of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only <br/>\nafter <br/>\nthe chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to <br/>\nsit and <br/>\nveg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family. <br/>\nThe <br/>\nkids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those <br/>\ndays <br/>\nwhere I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time <br/>\neverything <br/>\nseems to fall apart. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Sunday, June 17, 2001 - 11:28 pm:<br/>\nI guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it <br/>\nis <br/>\ngood and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you <br/>\ndo <br/>\nthat if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do <br/>\nwhat <br/>\nworks for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that <br/>\ntechnology <br/>\nhas many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on <br/>\nit...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times <br/>\nbut if <br/>\nI let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a <br/>\nrow <br/>\nwith no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel <br/>\nbetter <br/>\nand enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come <br/>\noutside <br/>\nand play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental <br/>\nexperience <br/>\ncomes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as <br/>\nthey <br/>\nshow growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as <br/>\ntoo much <br/>\ncontrol but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is <br/>\nnot <br/>\nnegative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of <br/>\ncontact with <br/>\nfamily members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m <br/>\nnot <br/>\ntelling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us. <br/>\nThere <br/>\nare numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per <br/>\nday is <br/>\ndetrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel <br/>\nlike <br/>\nit&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but <br/>\nthe tv. <br/>\nAnd too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not <br/>\nfun <br/>\nto be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone <br/>\nthat <br/>\nbecame &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was <br/>\nalways reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or <br/>\nsomething <br/>\nelse to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the <br/>\nearth, with <br/>\nthe animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to <br/>\nme that <br/>\nmy children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the <br/>\nopportunity to <br/>\nlearn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this <br/>\nand <br/>\nwatch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time <br/>\nspent <br/>\ndoing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works <br/>\nfor <br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Monday, June 18, 2001 - 04:10 pm:<br/>\nI think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to <br/>\nhave <br/>\nthe tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you <br/>\nmust, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the <br/>\nIndians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of <br/>\nit. <br/>\nNo, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about <br/>\nbeing <br/>\nin touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing <br/>\nourselves in <br/>\nexcess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across <br/>\nthe <br/>\nboard applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason <br/>\nI <br/>\nchoose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a <br/>\nconnection <br/>\nto her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot; <br/>\nany more <br/>\nthan we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat <br/>\nmakes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire <br/>\non <br/>\nme...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nthink so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor <br/>\ndid <br/>\nit turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our <br/>\nhouse? <br/>\nWould that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as <br/>\nnecessary <br/>\nto a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view <br/>\nvideos <br/>\nand have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one <br/>\nfor 6 <br/>\nmonths last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in <br/>\nthe <br/>\npast (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people <br/>\nfaced not <br/>\nso long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nthat <br/>\ndeprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the <br/>\nstudies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to <br/>\naccount. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have <br/>\nneglectful <br/>\nparents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of <br/>\nthe tv <br/>\nmost of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from <br/>\nsitting <br/>\nin front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only <br/>\npoint <br/>\nbefore was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing <br/>\nthese <br/>\nthings, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthat. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes, <br/>\nthat <br/>\nmay mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that <br/>\narea <br/>\nover to them and that is a good thing for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>\nThe topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the <br/>\ntime her <br/>\nson spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we <br/>\nwould <br/>\n(which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no <br/>\nworry <br/>\nabout it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very <br/>\nvaluable <br/>\neven if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with <br/>\nsome of <br/>\nyou, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic <br/>\ngames, tv <br/>\nyou name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am <br/>\na <br/>\nmother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga, <br/>\npaints, <br/>\nteaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!! <br/>\nAnd yet, <br/>\nif I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it <br/>\nevery <br/>\ntime. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned <br/>\nthat I <br/>\nwould like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it <br/>\nlimited <br/>\nbecause he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be <br/>\nwilling <br/>\nto up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example <br/>\ndoes <br/>\nrub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all <br/>\nday <br/>\nevery day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot <br/>\nof <br/>\nyou have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well. <br/>\nBut <br/>\ntheir are different kids with different personalities and each of us <br/>\nhas to <br/>\nfind what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is <br/>\nequally <br/>\naffected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very <br/>\naddictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very <br/>\nobvious. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 11:48 pm:<br/>\nI&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let <br/>\nhim <br/>\nget to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy <br/>\nin the <br/>\nhouse to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row <br/>\nwith no <br/>\ncontrol and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all <br/>\nkids are <br/>\nlike that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he <br/>\nhas had <br/>\nlong binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he <br/>\ncompletes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on <br/>\ntime and <br/>\nmake sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is <br/>\nfree <br/>\nto choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nsee that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as <br/>\nand as <br/>\noften as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For <br/>\nmost kids <br/>\nmaybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days <br/>\nplaying <br/>\nNintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but <br/>\nbe <br/>\nmean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He <br/>\nis not <br/>\nusually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding <br/>\nthings <br/>\nand it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in <br/>\nmy <br/>\nmind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any <br/>\nof <br/>\nit, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness <br/>\nto <br/>\nlet them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor <br/>\ntime&quot; but <br/>\nI do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin <br/>\nfever...LOL. <br/>\nUsually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all <br/>\ntogether...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time <br/>\ndown <br/>\nthere with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida <br/>\nmosquitoes!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Wednesday, June 20, 2001 - 10:51 am:<br/>\nI appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me <br/>\nthink. I <br/>\nam personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any <br/>\nkind, we <br/>\nare very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our <br/>\nmoney on <br/>\ntravel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it <br/>\nhimself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy <br/>\nthe new <br/>\nZelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from <br/>\nit...that <br/>\nis definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that <br/>\ntends to <br/>\nget grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and <br/>\nneeds <br/>\nto move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot, <br/>\njust <br/>\nhis way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv <br/>\nand <br/>\ncould care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are <br/>\njust <br/>\ndifferent souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better <br/>\nwhen <br/>\nhe&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for <br/>\nlimiting <br/>\nit, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is <br/>\nappropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is <br/>\nin <br/>\norder and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is <br/>\nan <br/>\nongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen. <br/>\nObviously he <br/>\nknows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s <br/>\ntaught <br/>\nme a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game <br/>\nhe <br/>\nwants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting <br/>\nirritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we <br/>\nhad a <br/>\nlittle converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough <br/>\nand I <br/>\nagreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I <br/>\nknow how <br/>\nobsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A <br/>\nnot so <br/>\ngood trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me <br/>\nsomething <br/>\nthat day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I <br/>\nagree <br/>\nthat we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my <br/>\nson. <br/>\nAnd we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe <br/>\nthat&#39;s why <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults <br/>\nhave <br/>\ndifferent rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to do here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Thursday, June 21, 2001 - 05:25 pm:<br/>\nI think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different <br/>\nunschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make <br/>\nthem <br/>\n&quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand <br/>\nthe <br/>\nconcept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are <br/>\nindeed <br/>\nunschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I <br/>\nunderstand <br/>\nwhat you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage <br/>\npeople <br/>\nand teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against <br/>\nwell-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you. <br/>\nBut I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining <br/>\nwhy I <br/>\ndo it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of <br/>\nthis...I just expect certain things done before we do other <br/>\nactivities--helps <br/>\nme be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another <br/>\nperson but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at <br/>\nsome <br/>\npoint but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it <br/>\nopen. <br/>\nThere are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different <br/>\npeople, <br/>\nwith different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not <br/>\nmessing with it...LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Friday, June 29, 2001 - 04:26 pm:<br/>\nI too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this <br/>\nhasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of <br/>\nthe <br/>\nD___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have <br/>\nfound <br/>\nthat my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they <br/>\njust <br/>\nneed a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they <br/>\nreally want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving <br/>\nit <br/>\nalone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about <br/>\nmy <br/>\nviews and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I <br/>\nwas <br/>\nactually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he <br/>\nshowed me a <br/>\nbunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m <br/>\nquestioning <br/>\nmy motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another <br/>\nactivity, <br/>\nlike they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 03:28 pm:<br/>\nwell I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to <br/>\nbe any <br/>\ndifferent..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs <br/>\nover it. <br/>\nI have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out <br/>\nfirst. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and <br/>\nready <br/>\nto help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on <br/>\nvery <br/>\nlittle control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has <br/>\nspent <br/>\nthree full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for <br/>\nit. How <br/>\nlong do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not <br/>\nagree <br/>\nwith sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your <br/>\nwords <br/>\n(Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out <br/>\nbefore I <br/>\nintervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some <br/>\ngames <br/>\nput him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time <br/>\nand <br/>\nit&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere <br/>\nyou want <br/>\nand work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So <br/>\nwe&#39;re <br/>\nlearning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv <br/>\non <br/>\nalso. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 07:31 pm:<br/>\nYeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the <br/>\nproblem is <br/>\nliving in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nprivate spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug <br/>\nme so <br/>\nmuch. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and <br/>\nfigure <br/>\nout what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to <br/>\ndo <br/>\nwith our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his <br/>\ninsights on <br/>\nthe issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but <br/>\nhe <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant <br/>\nchange <br/>\nfor sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal <br/>\nthe <br/>\nway he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly <br/>\nspending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide <br/>\nand <br/>\nwhatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting <br/>\nagain....something <br/>\nI sure wish I had learned at a young age. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh <br/>\nand I <br/>\nare very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a <br/>\ntriathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid <br/>\nLOVES swim <br/>\nteam and goes to practice every day of the week with very few <br/>\nexceptions...so <br/>\nrelax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a <br/>\nwaste <br/>\nof time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not <br/>\nsure how <br/>\ncomfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not <br/>\ncomfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a <br/>\nconsiderable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with <br/>\nhousehold stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is <br/>\nhelping them <br/>\nfeel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling <br/>\nover <br/>\nall...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any <br/>\npromises <br/>\nhere. Just trying to find the balance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Monday, August 6, 2001 - 03:15 am:<br/>\nI&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s <br/>\nok to <br/>\nlimit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not <br/>\ninterested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything. <br/>\nIf I <br/>\nsay &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is <br/>\nusually <br/>\nglad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to <br/>\nwatch I <br/>\njust say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot; <br/>\nand he <br/>\nalways is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but <br/>\nI <br/>\nthink there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it <br/>\nthan <br/>\nothers. I just disagree with total self regulation on that <br/>\ntopic....sorry. I <br/>\ndo believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self <br/>\nregulation <br/>\nworks for all of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Friday, August 10, 2001 - 08:10 pm:<br/>\nOk, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of <br/>\nveggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the <br/>\njunk. The <br/>\nkey to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if <br/>\nyou <br/>\nhave healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as <br/>\nthe <br/>\njunk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my <br/>\nneices/nephews. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the <br/>\nmore <br/>\nthey will balance it all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy ren on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 - 10:39 am:<br/>\nThe first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t <br/>\nhad <br/>\nenough time to deschool&quot;.... <br/>\nIt took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior <br/>\nto <br/>\nthat. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of <br/>\ninventiveness I hadn&#39;t before. <br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons <br/>\nor <br/>\nwriting. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10 <br/>\ntimes 5 <br/>\nlast night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you <br/>\nknow <br/>\nwhat? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being <br/>\nin <br/>\ntouch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to <br/>\nwrite or <br/>\ndo math equations. <br/>\nKeep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work. <br/>\nI totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot; <br/>\nenough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and <br/>\na new <br/>\nbaby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an <br/>\nunschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad <br/>\nnightly <br/>\nin Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical <br/>\nthinking, <br/>\nreading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides <br/>\netc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday <br/>\n(complete <br/>\nwith decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in <br/>\nany <br/>\nway. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house, <br/>\nwatching tv and just hanging out too. <br/>\nYour girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever <br/>\neven <br/>\nseen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important <br/>\nthings <br/>\nabout their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of <br/>\ndaily <br/>\nliving and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are <br/>\nabsorbing all of that. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Thursday, October 4, 2001 - 11:10 am:<br/>\nHaving formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting <br/>\nthem <br/>\nchoose I can relate to both sides of this issue. <br/>\nI have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I <br/>\nhave <br/>\nto come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere <br/>\ntoday. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy) <br/>\nafter <br/>\nbeing very social. Like down time for them. <br/>\nI have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that <br/>\nI&#39;m <br/>\nmore relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that <br/>\n&quot;forbidden <br/>\nfruit&quot; thing! <br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and <br/>\nsaying <br/>\n&quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 10:14 am:<br/>\nI had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv. <br/>\nI got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints <br/>\nin this <br/>\nvery forum not too long ago. <br/>\nThat annoyed feeling made me think though. <br/>\nIt made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!! <br/>\nCOULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control? <br/>\nWas I hindering their world in some way? <br/>\nI finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE. <br/>\nMy children have a right to choose their own life. <br/>\nAnd they have now. <br/>\nTrevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthe new cable we had installed. <br/>\nBetter now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on <br/>\nhis own <br/>\nimo. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire <br/>\nhousehold. <br/>\nNow that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really <br/>\nenjoyed <br/>\nsome wonderful moments as a family. <br/>\nMy kids have learned a TON from it. <br/>\nI just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the <br/>\nlearning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it. <br/>\nTo me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to <br/>\nshun one <br/>\ntool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool <br/>\ncan&#39;t <br/>\noffer. <br/>\nAll of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above? <br/>\nCan you believe that we have that AND a telly? <br/>\nHmmm.... <br/>\nThe television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool. <br/>\nYou can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over <br/>\nyour life <br/>\nunless you want it to. <br/>\nSome of these responses make me wonder if people think television is <br/>\nakin to <br/>\nsmoking and causes addiction. <br/>\nWhy would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nspouses or listen to them 100%? <br/>\nDo you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a <br/>\nconversation? <br/>\nI find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have <br/>\neffective <br/>\ncommunication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh. <br/>\nAnd insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 03:31 pm:<br/>\n. &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThen it won&#39;t work. <br/>\nYou can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking <br/>\nabout. <br/>\nOnly total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in <br/>\nthis <br/>\nforum. <br/>\nYou will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick <br/>\non <br/>\ncandy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control <br/>\nyet) <br/>\nand you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot; <br/>\nIt only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always <br/>\nthere. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning <br/>\nthat is <br/>\navailable through television because of what I view as the negative <br/>\naspects <br/>\nof it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative <br/>\naspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen <br/>\nthis repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be <br/>\nentertained &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative <br/>\nthings on <br/>\ntelevision, you will shut down the positive aspects of it? <br/>\nThat&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are <br/>\nnegative. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot; <br/>\n??? <br/>\nReally? Well, that is not true in my house. <br/>\nMy 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative, <br/>\nprefers <br/>\nto daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw. <br/>\nHe has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his <br/>\ncreativity abound. <br/>\nHe is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have <br/>\na 12 <br/>\ny.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for <br/>\na <br/>\nwhile....... <br/>\nI suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view. <br/>\nKids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area. <br/>\nEverything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited. <br/>\nOf course their creativity is stifled. <br/>\nAnd independant play is not necessarily a good thing. <br/>\nSome people need more person to person interaction, others are more <br/>\nintroverted. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with <br/>\npreschoolers. <br/>\nIndependance is overrated. <br/>\nInterdependance is much healthier. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nwatch that much. &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to <br/>\nperson. <br/>\nI&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer. <br/>\nHomeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree. <br/>\nThat&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot <br/>\nof <br/>\nschool ideas into their lives. <br/>\nI suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the <br/>\nbetter way. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.

I feel that all forms of entertainment need to be put in <br/>\nperspective <br/>\nand prioritized. To me tv, computer games and gameboy are mostly <br/>\nentertainment value. Yes, my kids learn certain positive things from <br/>\neach of <br/>\nthese, they are not bad in and of themselves...but I do limit the <br/>\namount of <br/>\ntime we do those activities. This has worked for us and we let the kids <br/>\nbe <br/>\npart of the decision on what is a healthy amount of time, and then only <br/>\nafter <br/>\nthe chores, activities, errands etc.... are done do we allow them to <br/>\nsit and <br/>\nveg. This may not sound very &quot;unschooled&quot; but it works in our family. <br/>\nThe <br/>\nkids don&#39;t feel cheated and I have some sanity. There are always those <br/>\ndays <br/>\nwhere I just let them choose 100% but if I do that all the time <br/>\neverything <br/>\nseems to fall apart. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Sunday, June 17, 2001 - 11:28 pm:<br/>\nI guess I believe along Charlotte Masons&#39; ideas on this topic. That it <br/>\nis <br/>\ngood and healthy to be outdoors for long periods of time....how do you <br/>\ndo <br/>\nthat if hours and hours are spent at a tv or electronics games? You do <br/>\nwhat <br/>\nworks for your family, we do what works for us right? I feel that <br/>\ntechnology <br/>\nhas many benefits but one negative is that we become too dependant on <br/>\nit...and yes, my kids VEG when in front of a tv. That&#39;s fine at times <br/>\nbut if <br/>\nI let them choose 100%of the time they spend all day for many days in a <br/>\nrow <br/>\nwith no sign of interest in anything else. They have told me they feel <br/>\nbetter <br/>\nand enjoy the day more when I regulate it and remind them to &quot;come <br/>\noutside <br/>\nand play&quot; or go swim or whatever. I think that&#39;s where parental <br/>\nexperience <br/>\ncomes in to play...at some age they have to choose on their own but as <br/>\nthey <br/>\nshow growth and maturity I let go more and more. You may see this as <br/>\ntoo much <br/>\ncontrol but I do view excess amounts of electronics as negative. It is <br/>\nnot <br/>\nnegative in and of itself but when it begins to rob your life of <br/>\ncontact with <br/>\nfamily members and doing the other things you love---it&#39;s too much! I&#39;m <br/>\nnot <br/>\ntelling you how to run things in your house...just what works for us. <br/>\nThere <br/>\nare numerous studies that show anything in excess of 2 hours of tv per <br/>\nday is <br/>\ndetrimental....maybe that isn&#39;t true for everyone but I personally feel <br/>\nlike <br/>\nit&#39;s a big time waster. It is a passive activity..not the games, but <br/>\nthe tv. <br/>\nAnd too much of that causes my oldest to become very aggressive and not <br/>\nfun <br/>\nto be around. I grew up without a tv and guess what? I was not someone <br/>\nthat <br/>\nbecame &quot;bored&quot; because I could think up my own things to do...there was <br/>\nalways reading, putting on skits, building tree forts, sledding or <br/>\nsomething <br/>\nelse to do. I think people today are not in touch enough with the <br/>\nearth, with <br/>\nthe animals and things that grow under their feet. It is important to <br/>\nme that <br/>\nmy children spend a lot of time outdoors so that they have the <br/>\nopportunity to <br/>\nlearn about and be connected to the earth. Of course you can do this <br/>\nand <br/>\nwatch tv, play games etc... but we are on the topic of EXCESS time <br/>\nspent <br/>\ndoing those things. Live and let live, each person has to do what works <br/>\nfor <br/>\nthem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Monday, June 18, 2001 - 04:10 pm:<br/>\nI think that&#39;s great that it worked out that way...I&#39;m not willing to <br/>\nhave <br/>\nthe tv on that much of the time at our house. Call it a hang up if you <br/>\nmust, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m very old fashioned that way. I think along the lines of how the <br/>\nIndians lived...totally in touch with the earth and how to live off of <br/>\nit. <br/>\nNo, we usually don&#39;t have to do that now but I feel very strongly about <br/>\nbeing <br/>\nin touch with the life force that sustains us and not absorbing <br/>\nourselves in <br/>\nexcess amounts of technology. I agree with you Joyce about not across <br/>\nthe <br/>\nboard applying someones views, but that is the part of Charlotte Mason <br/>\nI <br/>\nchoose to apply. Not because she was &quot;right&quot; but because we feel a <br/>\nconnection <br/>\nto her words about being outdoors. And we do not have &quot;outdoor time&quot; <br/>\nany more <br/>\nthan we have math time. I choose to limit tv and gameboy, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat <br/>\nmakes me an evil parent! Maybe you are all right and it will backfire <br/>\non <br/>\nme...they will turn into tv junkies for the rest of their lives, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nthink so. Growing up without one in my house did not limit my world nor <br/>\ndid <br/>\nit turn me into a tv addict. What if we chose not to have one in our <br/>\nhouse? <br/>\nWould that make me overly controlling? I don&#39;t see these things as <br/>\nnecessary <br/>\nto a full life. Just an extra. The only reason we own one is to view <br/>\nvideos <br/>\nand have access to news occasionally....my kids and I did not have one <br/>\nfor 6 <br/>\nmonths last year and it was awesome. Didn&#39;t miss it. Maybe I&#39;m stuck in <br/>\nthe <br/>\npast (and no, I don&#39;t have illusions about the difficulties people <br/>\nfaced not <br/>\nso long ago) but I like living a fairly simple life, I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nthat <br/>\ndeprives my kids of anything. You may have a point about the <br/>\nstudies...obviously there are a lot of factors that aren&#39;t taken in to <br/>\naccount. My feeling is that sometimes the kids they study have <br/>\nneglectful <br/>\nparents that are absent or out of it and the kids just sit in front of <br/>\nthe tv <br/>\nmost of the day, every day. I personally don&#39;t see any benefit from <br/>\nsitting <br/>\nin front of it every day but that&#39;s an individuals choice. My only <br/>\npoint <br/>\nbefore was not that parents should limit their childrens time doing <br/>\nthese <br/>\nthings, but that if they choose to I personally do not see a problem <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthat. Unschooling means I allow my children to self-educate--and yes, <br/>\nthat <br/>\nmay mean vegging at times. But I do not hand complete control of that <br/>\narea <br/>\nover to them and that is a good thing for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 05:42 pm:<br/>\nThe topic started with a question on whether a mom should limit the <br/>\ntime her <br/>\nson spent on an electronic game and some of us responded that yes, we <br/>\nwould <br/>\n(which evolved into the tv debate) and others said No, they would no <br/>\nworry <br/>\nabout it. Topics often evolve into other discussions which are very <br/>\nvaluable <br/>\neven if not totally linked with the first question, yk? I agree with <br/>\nsome of <br/>\nyou, I have a son that is a bit addictive with it ( any electronic <br/>\ngames, tv <br/>\nyou name it) and I set a very good example as far as being active. I am <br/>\na <br/>\nmother of four that kickboxes, plays tennis, runs, bikes, takes yoga, <br/>\npaints, <br/>\nteaches art classes etc... almost every week I do all of the above!! <br/>\nAnd yet, <br/>\nif I don&#39;t limit the electronic entertainment, my son will choose it <br/>\nevery <br/>\ntime. Its funny, I brought up this discussion with him and mentioned <br/>\nthat I <br/>\nwould like his input again on this topic. He said that he wants it <br/>\nlimited <br/>\nbecause he finds that his day goes better but asked me if I would be <br/>\nwilling <br/>\nto up his gameboy time by 15 minutes. I was fine with that. My example <br/>\ndoes <br/>\nrub off but not enough to keep him from doing nothing but tv almost all <br/>\nday <br/>\nevery day. I am all for limits imposed by parents. It sounds like a lot <br/>\nof <br/>\nyou have not had to impose the limits and it&#39;s worked out really well. <br/>\nBut <br/>\ntheir are different kids with different personalities and each of us <br/>\nhas to <br/>\nfind what works and what we are comfortable with YK? And my son is <br/>\nequally <br/>\naffected by the games, tv and computer. Anything passive he finds very <br/>\naddictive and it makes him MEAN if he gets too much...it&#39;s very <br/>\nobvious. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - 11:48 pm:<br/>\nI&#39;m not willing to go through the months and months it may take to let <br/>\nhim <br/>\nget to that point, nor am I willing to let him turn into the mean guy <br/>\nin the <br/>\nhouse to acheive that end. I have let it go for several days in a row <br/>\nwith no <br/>\ncontrol and it makes the day very unhappy for all involved. Not all <br/>\nkids are <br/>\nlike that, but he is. And I don&#39;t think scarcity is the problem as he <br/>\nhas had <br/>\nlong binges and gets to play it every day if he wants--just AFTER he <br/>\ncompletes chores and whatever else he has planned. We set a limit on <br/>\ntime and <br/>\nmake sure the household goals for the day are met. At that point he is <br/>\nfree <br/>\nto choose his gameboy up to the amount of time he has preset with us. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nsee that letting a child use tv, electronic games, etc... as much as <br/>\nand as <br/>\noften as they want always has the effect you are talking about. For <br/>\nmost kids <br/>\nmaybe, but everyone is different that way. He has spent entire days <br/>\nplaying <br/>\nNintendo (at a friends house, we will not buy one) and done nothing but <br/>\nbe <br/>\nmean to his brother and end the day with quite an attitude problem. He <br/>\nis not <br/>\nusually like this. Anyway, I understand your point about withholding <br/>\nthings <br/>\nand it becomes the &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; but I don&#39;t think that healthy (in <br/>\nmy <br/>\nmind) regulation is a bad thing in every case. I could live without any <br/>\nof <br/>\nit, so the fact that we own gameboys and tv is a sign of my willingness <br/>\nto <br/>\nlet them choose. And I do not prescribe a certain time as &quot;outdoor <br/>\ntime&quot; but <br/>\nI do kick them out if they start acting like they have cabin <br/>\nfever...LOL. <br/>\nUsually they go down to the creek and forget about electricity all <br/>\ntogether...mud is wonderful for that! And yes, I spend a lot of time <br/>\ndown <br/>\nthere with them, getting eaten by the large and hungry Florida <br/>\nmosquitoes!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Wednesday, June 20, 2001 - 10:51 am:<br/>\nI appreciate your thoughts on this topic. And as usual they make me <br/>\nthink. I <br/>\nam personally not willing to spend money on a gaming system of any <br/>\nkind, we <br/>\nare very simple with anything materialistic and prefer to spend our <br/>\nmoney on <br/>\ntravel. Now if my son were to save his own money and want to purchas it <br/>\nhimself that would be a different matter. He has saved $30.00 to buy <br/>\nthe new <br/>\nZelda game for his gameboy. Now on the issue of me keeping him from <br/>\nit...that <br/>\nis definitely not where the anger comes from. This is a child that <br/>\ntends to <br/>\nget grumpy if he does anything passive for too long (even reading) and <br/>\nneeds <br/>\nto move physically a lot. Doesn&#39;t like to sit still and fidgets a lot, <br/>\njust <br/>\nhis way. My younger son doesn&#39;t get the mean streak from gaming and tv <br/>\nand <br/>\ncould care less about it if you mention doing something else. They are <br/>\njust <br/>\ndifferent souls. He has asked me to limit his time as he feels better <br/>\nwhen <br/>\nhe&#39;s not on it too much. There isn&#39;t any anger directed at me for <br/>\nlimiting <br/>\nit, but then, he is part of the process of choosing how much time is <br/>\nappropriate. And I&#39;m a lot more relaxed about it all when the house is <br/>\nin <br/>\norder and we are done with that part of our responsibilities. This is <br/>\nan <br/>\nongoing process though, as he is getting close to being a teen. <br/>\nObviously he <br/>\nknows my hesitations over the health of excess tv and games but he&#39;s <br/>\ntaught <br/>\nme a lot on that topic himself. He&#39;s been obsessed with this Zelda game <br/>\nhe <br/>\nwants to buy and talks about it constantly. I realized I was getting <br/>\nirritated about his obsession with it and when he picked up on that we <br/>\nhad a <br/>\nlittle converstion. He pointed out that I was not trusting him enough <br/>\nand I <br/>\nagreed and let it go. I realized I was labeling the game (because I <br/>\nknow how <br/>\nobsessed he&#39;ll get for a while after buying it) as noneducational. A <br/>\nnot so <br/>\ngood trap to get into. Anyway, I do listen to him and he taught me <br/>\nsomething <br/>\nthat day. But I still won&#39;t be buying a Nintendo system..my dh and I <br/>\nagree <br/>\nthat we&#39;d rather spend our money in other ways. That will be up to my <br/>\nson. <br/>\nAnd we limit the tv time for all of us, not just my son...so maybe <br/>\nthat&#39;s why <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal. I hate households where the adults <br/>\nhave <br/>\ndifferent rules for the kids than they do for themselves....that&#39;s not <br/>\nwhat <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to do here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Thursday, June 21, 2001 - 05:25 pm:<br/>\nI think it&#39;s ok to agree to disagree also...YK? Just because different <br/>\nunschooling parents do things differently in each home does not make <br/>\nthem <br/>\n&quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; unschool. Yes, there are those that do not understand <br/>\nthe <br/>\nconcept and are calling what they do unschool but the majority are <br/>\nindeed <br/>\nunschooling, with differing views on tv, teeth brushing etc... I <br/>\nunderstand <br/>\nwhat you are saying about making your point well defined to encourage <br/>\npeople <br/>\nand teach each other but I think sometimes you will come up against <br/>\nwell-informed, intelligent people that just plain disagree with you. <br/>\nBut I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel the need to make everyone do things my way, just explaining <br/>\nwhy I <br/>\ndo it the way I do. My kids actually have a lot of freedom with most of <br/>\nthis...I just expect certain things done before we do other <br/>\nactivities--helps <br/>\nme be calm when the house is straightened-this might not bother another <br/>\nperson but it does me. And maybe I&#39;ll think exactly like all of you at <br/>\nsome <br/>\npoint but then again, maybe I will always feel this way? I&#39;m leaving it <br/>\nopen. <br/>\nThere are no black and whites on this issue to me...just different <br/>\npeople, <br/>\nwith different methods. And the way we do it works so right now I&#39;m not <br/>\nmessing with it...LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Friday, June 29, 2001 - 04:26 pm:<br/>\nI too, decided to relax and &quot;see&quot; what would happen...obviously this <br/>\nhasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen long enough for self regulation to kick in but I hate the sound of <br/>\nthe <br/>\nD___ thing all day. My dh also gets cranky with constant noise. I have <br/>\nfound <br/>\nthat my kids are fine if I say &quot;can we go do something else now?&quot; they <br/>\njust <br/>\nneed a little prompt (not a demand) They have found a couple shows they <br/>\nreally want to watch every day, other than that they don&#39;t mind leaving <br/>\nit <br/>\nalone. This discussion has prompted a lot of thought on my part about <br/>\nmy <br/>\nviews and where the negative thoughts about certain things come from. I <br/>\nwas <br/>\nactually asking my son how to play Pokemon on the game boy and he <br/>\nshowed me a <br/>\nbunch of tricks to it. So yes, I still regulate the tv....but I&#39;m <br/>\nquestioning <br/>\nmy motives more often. My kids act relieved when I suggest another <br/>\nactivity, <br/>\nlike they can&#39;t unglue by themselves...maybe it just takes more time. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 03:28 pm:<br/>\nwell I&#39;m definitely a freak, so I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect my kids to <br/>\nbe any <br/>\ndifferent..lol. I too, have relaxed and had some major ups and downs <br/>\nover it. <br/>\nI have decided to give them more control but still insist they help out <br/>\nfirst. Actually, I have not had to insist...they are very willing and <br/>\nready <br/>\nto help out. Probably because they can hardly beleive their luck on <br/>\nvery <br/>\nlittle control over tv and gameboy. I have to say though, my oldest has <br/>\nspent <br/>\nthree full days on his gameboy since he bought the new Zelda game for <br/>\nit. How <br/>\nlong do you let it go before you worry about their health? I do not <br/>\nagree <br/>\nwith sitting on your tushy all day...not healthy. But I&#39;m hearing your <br/>\nwords <br/>\n(Sandra, Anne and others) and letting him have time to figure it out <br/>\nbefore I <br/>\nintervene too heavily. He&#39;s been relatively pleasant--he thinks some <br/>\ngames <br/>\nput him in a rotten mood because you have to go up one level at a time <br/>\nand <br/>\nit&#39;s frustrating, where in the Zelda game you can go around anywhere <br/>\nyou want <br/>\nand work out different puzzles (kind of unschoolish eh? hmmmmmm). So <br/>\nwe&#39;re <br/>\nlearning and adjusting and in the mean time I am sick of hearing the tv <br/>\non <br/>\nalso. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy renallyn6 on Tuesday, July 3, 2001 - 07:31 pm:<br/>\nYeah, the earplugs hurt after a while. I think a large part of the <br/>\nproblem is <br/>\nliving in a tiny house (1250 sf) with six people that really value <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nprivate spaces. When I can&#39;t hear the tv all the time it does not bug <br/>\nme so <br/>\nmuch. And I&#39;m really proud that he could analyze himself so well and <br/>\nfigure <br/>\nout what made him grumpy about certain games...this thread had a lot to <br/>\ndo <br/>\nwith our conversations over it, I was really impressed with his <br/>\ninsights on <br/>\nthe issue. I&#39;ve heard a couple of &quot;damn&quot;s coming from the bedroom but <br/>\nhe <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t emerge in this rotten, be rude to everyone mode. A pleasant <br/>\nchange <br/>\nfor sure. And he spends his own money on the games so it was a big deal <br/>\nthe <br/>\nway he went about it. He ended up trading in some old games and hardly <br/>\nspending any money to buy it so he had some money for the game guide <br/>\nand <br/>\nwhatever else he wants. So he practiced his own budgeting <br/>\nagain....something <br/>\nI sure wish I had learned at a young age. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that I have a hard time with letting them sit around because dh <br/>\nand I <br/>\nare very active. I work out almost every day and we&#39;re training for a <br/>\ntriathlon right now. But then I have to stop and remember, the kid <br/>\nLOVES swim <br/>\nteam and goes to practice every day of the week with very few <br/>\nexceptions...so <br/>\nrelax right? Not so easy to do. I perceive his excess time on it as a <br/>\nwaste <br/>\nof time (not so easy to rid yourself of that one) and I&#39;m still not <br/>\nsure how <br/>\ncomfortable I am with this idea of self-regulation ( ok, ok, I&#39;m not <br/>\ncomfortable at all...but work with me here). But I have noticed a <br/>\nconsiderable change in their attitude when I ask them to help me with <br/>\nhousehold stuff or other things...maybe the control over this is <br/>\nhelping them <br/>\nfeel less controlled (even though I did not feel I was very controlling <br/>\nover <br/>\nall...just on that issue). Well, one day at a time...not making any <br/>\npromises <br/>\nhere. Just trying to find the balance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Monday, August 6, 2001 - 03:15 am:<br/>\nI&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that does believe it&#39;s <br/>\nok to <br/>\nlimit tv when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy and not <br/>\ninterested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say anything. <br/>\nIf I <br/>\nsay &quot;ok, enough tv for today&quot; and suggest that we do something, he is <br/>\nusually <br/>\nglad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of something he really wants to <br/>\nwatch I <br/>\njust say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over do you think we could go do something?&quot; <br/>\nand he <br/>\nalways is fine with that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but <br/>\nI <br/>\nthink there are some kids that are more addictive and affected by it <br/>\nthan <br/>\nothers. I just disagree with total self regulation on that <br/>\ntopic....sorry. I <br/>\ndo believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self <br/>\nregulation <br/>\nworks for all of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Friday, August 10, 2001 - 08:10 pm:<br/>\nOk, I know this is a little OT....I noticed my kids will eat oodles of <br/>\nveggies and healthy stuff if I make it as readily available as the <br/>\njunk. The <br/>\nkey to junk food is that you open a package and it&#39;s ready to eat...if <br/>\nyou <br/>\nhave healthy stuff as easy to get to, they will eat it just as much as <br/>\nthe <br/>\njunk. At least, this is an observance I&#39;ve made with my own and my <br/>\nneices/nephews. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think tv could be like that too....the more options available, the <br/>\nmore <br/>\nthey will balance it all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy ren on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 - 10:39 am:<br/>\nThe first thing I thought when I read your post Tam is &quot;they haven&#39;t <br/>\nhad <br/>\nenough time to deschool&quot;.... <br/>\nIt took mine over a year, and we were very relaxed homeschoolers prior <br/>\nto <br/>\nthat. Around 1 1/2 years later I started seeing some &quot;sparks&quot; of <br/>\ninventiveness I hadn&#39;t before. <br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say they suddenly developed a yearning for math lessons <br/>\nor <br/>\nwriting. My 8 y.o. doesn&#39;t read. My 11 1/2 y.o. couldn&#39;t tell us 10 <br/>\ntimes 5 <br/>\nlast night! I KNOW I taught him the 10X tables at least twice!! But you <br/>\nknow <br/>\nwhat? It has to be meaningful for them or it won&#39;t stick anyway. Being <br/>\nin <br/>\ntouch with oneself is so much more important than when they learn to <br/>\nwrite or <br/>\ndo math equations. <br/>\nKeep trusting them, keep trusting yourself. It really does work. <br/>\nI totally understand your apprehension about not &quot;strewing their paths&quot; <br/>\nenough. I have felt guilt over that lately too...going back to work and <br/>\na new <br/>\nbaby are eating up my time. But when I stand back and look at it in an <br/>\nunschooling perspective, it is rosy! The boys have battled their Dad <br/>\nnightly <br/>\nin Pokemon (the card game) which is massive amounts of strategical <br/>\nthinking, <br/>\nreading, math etc... We&#39;ve done relay races in the driveway, bike rides <br/>\netc... we had a birthday party for their stuffed animals yesterday <br/>\n(complete <br/>\nwith decorated cake and candles) So NO, it doesn&#39;t look like school in <br/>\nany <br/>\nway. But we are living life, as a family, complete with cleaning house, <br/>\nwatching tv and just hanging out too. <br/>\nYour girls are learning what an appraisal is. How many kids have ever <br/>\neven <br/>\nseen an appraiser? I bet most of them are in school when important <br/>\nthings <br/>\nabout their lives are going on. Don&#39;t take for granted the flow of <br/>\ndaily <br/>\nliving and what that teaches. It&#39;s REAL life...YOUR life. And they are <br/>\nabsorbing all of that. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy ren on Thursday, October 4, 2001 - 11:10 am:<br/>\nHaving formerly been a little controling, and now pretty much letting <br/>\nthem <br/>\nchoose I can relate to both sides of this issue. <br/>\nI have found that my kids often would love to do something else, but I <br/>\nhave <br/>\nto come up with an idea or just ask them if they&#39;d like to go somewhere <br/>\ntoday. I have also noticed they tend to watch more tv (or play gameboy) <br/>\nafter <br/>\nbeing very social. Like down time for them. <br/>\nI have noticed my kids being much less obsessive about the tv now that <br/>\nI&#39;m <br/>\nmore relaxed. I think Sandra, Anne and others are right about that <br/>\n&quot;forbidden <br/>\nfruit&quot; thing! <br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with waiting until a fave show is over and <br/>\nsaying <br/>\n&quot;hey, lets&#39; go outside and play tag&quot; or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 10:14 am:<br/>\nI had no TV for a while, I also had negative associations with tv. <br/>\nI got my feathers ruffled a little bit when bringing up my viewpoints <br/>\nin this <br/>\nvery forum not too long ago. <br/>\nThat annoyed feeling made me think though. <br/>\nIt made me ponder and question if maybe the people here were right!! <br/>\nCOULD I be causing addictive behavior in my children with my control? <br/>\nWas I hindering their world in some way? <br/>\nI finally had to admit that MY views on tv were just that.....MINE. <br/>\nMy children have a right to choose their own life. <br/>\nAnd they have now. <br/>\nTrevor had many years of control so he is still acting fairly obsessive <br/>\nwith <br/>\nthe new cable we had installed. <br/>\nBetter now, with the safety and guidance of his parents than later on <br/>\nhis own <br/>\nimo. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not fair for one persons prejudices to decide the entire <br/>\nhousehold. <br/>\nNow that I see tv for what it is, just another tool, we have really <br/>\nenjoyed <br/>\nsome wonderful moments as a family. <br/>\nMy kids have learned a TON from it. <br/>\nI just can&#39;t fathom an unschooler not having a tv and shunning all the <br/>\nlearning opportunities just because of their own prejudices against it. <br/>\nTo me, unschooling means using all of the tools at our disposal, to <br/>\nshun one <br/>\ntool means losing out on a host of opportunities that any other tool <br/>\ncan&#39;t <br/>\noffer. <br/>\nAll of those benefits to not owning one, that were listed above? <br/>\nCan you believe that we have that AND a telly? <br/>\nHmmm.... <br/>\nThe television is not evil. It&#39;s just a tool. <br/>\nYou can use it or not use it as you choose.....It doesn&#39;t take over <br/>\nyour life <br/>\nunless you want it to. <br/>\nSome of these responses make me wonder if people think television is <br/>\nakin to <br/>\nsmoking and causes addiction. <br/>\nWhy would you think that tv owners are less likely to really listen to <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nspouses or listen to them 100%? <br/>\nDo you think we all sit in front of the tv every time we have a <br/>\nconversation? <br/>\nI find that remark insulting, as though we tv owners can&#39;t have <br/>\neffective <br/>\ncommunication or healthy marriages!!! Sheesh. <br/>\nAnd insulting Sandra was really lame after you asked for her opinion. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBy Ren Allyn (Renstar) on Thursday, May 2, 2002 - 03:31 pm:<br/>\n. &quot;I will experiment with candy and get back to you&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThen it won&#39;t work. <br/>\nYou can&#39;t expect an experiment to reap the benefits we are talking <br/>\nabout. <br/>\nOnly total, long term trust will bring the results being discussed in <br/>\nthis <br/>\nforum. <br/>\nYou will try the &quot;experiment&quot;, see the children gorging themselves sick <br/>\non <br/>\ncandy and junk most likely (because they haven&#39;t learned self control <br/>\nyet) <br/>\nand you will say &quot;this does NOT work, what is wrong with those people?&quot; <br/>\nIt only reaps the benefits when the trust and non-control are always <br/>\nthere. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s ok with me at this point to let my children miss the learning <br/>\nthat is <br/>\navailable through television because of what I view as the negative <br/>\naspects <br/>\nof it - to me this over-rides what is positive. Some of these negative <br/>\naspects are: lack of attention and less independant creative play (I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen <br/>\nthis repeatedly as a pre-school teacher) and the desire to be <br/>\nentertained &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re suggesting is that because there are unhealthy/negative <br/>\nthings on <br/>\ntelevision, you will shut down the positive aspects of it? <br/>\nThat&#39;s like burning down the library because there are books that are <br/>\nnegative. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;lack of attention and less independant creative play&quot; <br/>\n??? <br/>\nReally? Well, that is not true in my house. <br/>\nMy 8 y.o. ds loves spending time by himself. He is highly creative, <br/>\nprefers <br/>\nto daydream alone much of the time, putter in the woods or draw. <br/>\nHe has unlimited access to tv, food, books etc... and yet I see his <br/>\ncreativity abound. <br/>\nHe is very good at entertaining himself. All of my kids are. But I have <br/>\na 12 <br/>\ny.o. that is still obsessing with the tv because we didn&#39;t have one for <br/>\na <br/>\nwhile....... <br/>\nI suggest you are inferring things from a limited point of view. <br/>\nKids in school can&#39;t even be compared to unschoolers in that area. <br/>\nEverything in their lives seems to be controlled, forced and limited. <br/>\nOf course their creativity is stifled. <br/>\nAnd independant play is not necessarily a good thing. <br/>\nSome people need more person to person interaction, others are more <br/>\nintroverted. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think that independant play is a goal for unschoolers with <br/>\npreschoolers. <br/>\nIndependance is overrated. <br/>\nInterdependance is much healthier. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Also I tend to think that unschoolers here and homeschoolers generally <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\nwatch that much. &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers here? Well that is going to vary a lot from person to <br/>\nperson. <br/>\nI&#39;ve read of some that do watch a lot, I don&#39;t. But just because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I will dictate my childrens viewing any longer. <br/>\nHomeschoolers in general probably villianize tv to a large degree. <br/>\nThat&#39;s been my experience, because many homeschoolers still carry a lot <br/>\nof <br/>\nschool ideas into their lives. <br/>\nI suggest that we&#39;ve all been duped, and letting children choose is the <br/>\nbetter way. <br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
