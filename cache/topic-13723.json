I was not dressed in <br/>\ncostume, however some other homeschoolers were. My son (age 7) didn&#39;t have <br/>\non a costume, but then wished he did once we got there because his two <br/>\nfriends, although not in full costume, had homemade shields and swords. As <br/>\nlong he feels comfortable in his costume, then I would think a 5 yo would <br/>\nenjoy going in his outfit. The actors walk around in character and they <br/>\naddressed our children, who had swords and shields, as &quot;young knights&quot; and <br/>\ninvolved them in the drama once they saw that the kids were in costume. I <br/>\nthink the people working there like having young kids with whom to interact <br/>\nbecause they still have a sense of wonder. The day we went, there were <br/>\nbusloads of older school kids who were heard to be rude and offensive to <br/>\nthe actors. My only suggestion would be to avoid going on a weekday when <br/>\nthere might be lots of kids who are there but are not interested in being <br/>\nthere. It makes the performances more enjoyable when you don&#39;t have to sit <br/>\nin front of people saying &quot;this is lame&quot; or &quot;this stinks&quot;! Fortunately, our <br/>\nchildren didn&#39;t receive any negative comments regarding their swords and <br/>\nshields from other &quot;guests&quot;. I don&#39;t know if other fairs and festivals have <br/>\ndifferent atmospheres, but I hope your visit is lots of fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOlivia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: Sat, 21 Oct 2000 20:33:02 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Cheryl &quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NicholasAcademy@...\">NicholasAcademy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Renaissance Festival<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, ds will<br/>\n&gt;definitely wear the outfit for Halloween, and we are thinking about<br/>\n&gt;him wearing it for the Renaissance festival coming up.
