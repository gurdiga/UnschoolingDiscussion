My child was climbing the same tree while <br/>\nwe were in line but when the line went inside they went in with me and I <br/>\nread to them out of our current read aloud.  And the both went into the <br/>\nlittle voting box with me, with Lexie actually participating in the <br/>\nprocess. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this woman brought her child with her to vote.  She <br/>\nbrought him with her to the church where she voted and he climbed a <br/>\ntree.  Not that tree climbing is not important, but both were possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I do realize I sound a bit ostentatious. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82558,"nextTopicId":82206}}
