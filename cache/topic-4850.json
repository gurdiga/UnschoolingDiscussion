I know my multiplication tables<br/>\nreally well and I can quickly and efficiently add and subtract even large<br/>\nnumbers in my head. I loathe and fear higher math, and have since I flunked<br/>\nAlgebra. I have spent my life in three main careers -- dog trainer (not a<br/>\nlot of advanced math required), bookseller (ditto) and... accountant. I was<br/>\na fine accountant. :) Worked my way up from Accounts Payable clerk to Cost<br/>\nAccountant and never had to think about &quot;higher math&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, take my husband (please! Da da dum! &lt;g&gt;). He can do no basic math<br/>\ncalculations in his head. He does not know his multiplication tables. He<br/>\nuses a calculator to add 10 + 12, okay? But he&#39;s *really* good at advanced<br/>\nmath. He plays math games with his father (computer programmer) and they<br/>\nthink up math puzzles to challenge each other that make my teeth fall asleep<br/>\n(the last one involved the calculation of the diameter of a roll of toilet<br/>\npaper given some incredibly obscure variables that I can&#39;t even remember,<br/>\nmuch less calculate). My husband is a Chief Estimator for a multi-million<br/>\ndollar construction company and his JOB is to develop forumulas for<br/>\ncalculating such simple things as the cost of esoteric non-standard-sized<br/>\ntiles and shelves in circular non-level rooms south of the Equator. <br/>\n<br/>\n10 + 12, however, still eludes him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; constant reiteration for basic facts, math or otherwise. I<br/>\nlearned my basic math facts in the wink of an eye because I found them<br/>\nuseful and enjoyable. My husband, drilled like most of us for 12 full years,<br/>\nstill does not know them because he did *not* find them useful and<br/>\nenjoyable. He uses his calculator for those and goes on to what he *does*<br/>\nfind useful and enjoyable. He also did not need &quot;book time&quot; to learn higher<br/>\nmath, just the interest to do so. Sure, many people who are interested in<br/>\nhigher math *do* sit down with books (Wally, though it is incomprehensible<br/>\nto me &lt;g&gt;, wants to buy a bunch of math computer CDs and do the &quot;book<br/>\nlearning&quot; that he never did in school. He&#39;s 43. This woman&#39;s teenage son has<br/>\nyears yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMath gets a bad rap. So many of us buy into the &quot;it&#39;s hard&quot; or &quot;it has to be<br/>\nrepeated daily&quot; or &quot;it must be taught in certain steps&quot; that shaking free of<br/>\nthat can be a real feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is no harder than training a dog.<br/>\nMath is no more useful than knowing how to sew a straight seam.<br/>\nMath does not require slavish, daily repetition to master basic concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe surest way to kill a child&#39;s (or adult&#39;s) interest in something is to<br/>\nforce it. Your friend obviously wishes her son were more interested in and<br/>\nskilled in math, but if he&#39;s not, he&#39;s not, and there is nothing holding him<br/>\nback but himself. He can sit down tomorrow with a stack of math books and<br/>\nprovided he has the real interest, he can learn it. He could have been<br/>\ndrilled at the kitchen table daily for 10 years and if he found it<br/>\nmind-numbing and boring and not pertinent to his life, he&#39;d be like my<br/>\nhusband.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have until we die to learn 10 + 12, and if we die and we still haven&#39;t<br/>\nlearned it, obviously we didn&#39;t need it after all. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\nCheck it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4852,"nextTopicId":4858}}
