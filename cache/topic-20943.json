If you use Normal, it uses 6<br/>\n&gt; gallons.  If you use potscrubber, it uses 8 gallons.  My dishwasher has a<br/>\n&gt; food grinder in the bottom that grinds up any food that makes it&#39;s way to<br/>\n&gt; the bottom of the dishwasher therefore no food sticks on the dishes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I spoke with a representative, she said if you have an electric hot<br/>\n&gt; water heater, you use approx. $55 a year in electricity for an average<br/>\n&gt; family.  If you have a gas hot water heater, it uses approx. $35<br/>\n&gt; annually.(This does include heating the water, which you have to do anyway<br/>\n&gt; to wash by hand)  My hot water is heated off our oil burner and uses quite<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; bit less energy than both electricity and gas. (at current prices)  I<br/>\n&gt; challenge any of you who do dishes by hand to to the same amount of dishes<br/>\n&gt; that fit into my dishwasher by hand and keep track of the water you use.<br/>\n&gt; Rinsing takes a lot of water, esp. if you leave it running while you do<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; dishes.  8 gallons might sound like a lot, but it isn&#39;t if you are<br/>\nstanding<br/>\n&gt; there doing dishes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It still takes electricity or some energy source to heat the water you<br/>\nwash<br/>\n&gt; dishes with.  And I generally use the light china cycle on my dishwasher.<br/>\n&gt; (only uses 4 gallons)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Angela in Maine<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling mom to two beautiful daughters.<br/>\n&gt; www.geocities.com/autonomousangela<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Your dishwasher uses between 1800 and 2400 watts per hour of electricity<br/>\n&gt;   which is energy that you wouldn&#39;t be using if you washed by hand.  The<br/>\n&gt;   average dishwasher (according to the Tampa water department) uses 15<br/>\n&gt; gallons<br/>\n&gt;   of water with water saving models using around 10.  The average for<br/>\n&gt;   handwashing is 5 - 7 gallons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!

I&#39;ll take your dishwasher when you are done with it!  We moved to a suburb of D.C. when my spouse was in the military, and we did not know how long we would be here.  We were also in sticker shock about prices.  We have a rental home in a good neighborhood.  The landlord wishes to put no money into it. We have 40 yo linoleum and kitchen cabinets.  The dishwasher is the cheapest available.  There is no place for any pieces of food to collect or drain.  I&#39;ve read the instructions which direct us to clean out the water spray openings if we notice the dishes aren&#39;t getting clean as it may mean food has clogged them since there is no place for the food to go!

In the first home we ever had, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nread the instruction manual, and shortly after we moved in there, <br/>\nthe dishwasher started leaking water out into the floor.  We called <br/>\na repairman, who promptly pulled out the trap in the bottom of the <br/>\ndishwasher, which was full of food.  He told me it was imperative to <br/>\nrinse the dishes first, because the food particles can stop up the <br/>\ndrain which empties the water out of the dishwasher.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am only going by personal experience and what the <br/>\ninstruction book said.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there is something very satisfying about washing them by <br/>\nhand, having the water running over your hands, using natural <br/>\nmaterials....I&#39;ve tried to get my kids to understand that anything <br/>\ncan be a spiritual experience if you think of it in that way.  I know, <br/>\nyou are probably laughing right now thinking about washing dishes <br/>\nas a spiritual experience.  But sometimes, the only way I can <br/>\nmake myself do something I really don&#39;t want to do is to give it <br/>\nspecial meaning, and find something about it I can appreciate and <br/>\nenjoy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJudie<br/>\n<br/>\nThe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; only thing my dishwasher doens&#39; t get off dishes is cream of wheat.
