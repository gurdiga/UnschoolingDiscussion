I&#39;m bushed!  There were 803 new messages in my inbox!<br/>\n<br/>\n  The conference was just fantastic!!  Being in a space with so many <br/>\n  like-minded, unschooling, kid-respecting people was a dream come-true for <br/>\n  me.  I wish there were a way to have an IRL community with these folks <br/>\n  rather than only this virtual community, but this wonderful virtual <br/>\n  community definitely fills a great need.  Without it, I&#39;d never have met <br/>\n  all those wonderful folks and had this great adventure with Liam driving <br/>\n  nearly 1600 miles.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sleepyhead (A.K.A. Liam) has just informed me that he must have a story so <br/>\n  I&#39;ve gotta cut this message short.  I just want to quickly say that my hat <br/>\n  is off to all the folks who pulled together the conference, to the <br/>\n  presenters who managed to do some fancy footwork when the schedule needed <br/>\n  to be rearranged, to all the kids and their parents who were all just <br/>\n  wonderful folks to be around, and to Sandra who I am so glad I got to <br/>\n  meet.  I&#39;ll never forget Sunday, October 13th because I got to meet her and <br/>\n  tell her what a great influence she has been in my life (and Liam&#39;s life, <br/>\n  too!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Note to Ren and kids:  We miss you guys!  If you ever want to go to the <br/>\n  other Florida, there&#39;s a little home there with your name on it (it&#39;s <br/>\n  definitely larger, though, than the Clarion Town House&#39;s room 562!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I gotta go!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Love to all!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n  P.S.
