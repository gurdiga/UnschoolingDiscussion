DH called her Cassidy (which I did NOT like) from the moment we found out she was a girl, and the boys added Belle.... they were constantly saying &quot;Cassie Belle&quot; to my belly, and it grew on me. After that, none of the other names I&#39;d picked out seemed &quot;right&quot; so we have our little Cassidy Belle now, and I can&#39;t imagine her named anything else.<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s funny. I didn&#39;t like the name Jared at all when dh mentioned it.  <br/>\n  Trevor (oldest boy) loved it and they both started referring to my bulging <br/>\n  belly as &quot;Baby Jared&quot; by four months into the pregnancy.<br/>\n  I kept saying that NO we were not going to name this baby Jared, it was going <br/>\n  to be Connor or Donovan or something a bit Irish.<br/>\n  But after months of them talking to the little guy and calling him Jared, it <br/>\n  grew on me.<br/>\n  The moment they laid that wet newborn on my chest I said &quot;baby Jared&quot; and <br/>\n  sighed.
