His cousin, too,<br/>\nwas sooo traumatized by any nature shows with wild<br/>\nanimals in them at all when he was 5, cuz one time he<br/>\nwas watching a lion video and the lion started<br/>\nfighting with another animal. Not horribly chomping on<br/>\nhim (yet, anyway, I&#39;m sure that happened later after<br/>\nthe video was frantically turned off)....he was sooo<br/>\nupset by any conflict at all.
