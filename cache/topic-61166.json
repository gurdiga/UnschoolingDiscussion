But then<br/>\nso does my ds, whose 9 next month. I started him on them when he was just a<br/>\ntoddler. He knows most of the songs as well and will sing along with them,<br/>\ntoo. I think his favourite is &quot;If I Were A Rich Man&quot;. It&#39;s a great movie to<br/>\nlearn from. How traditions get changed ( the daughters different marriages),<br/>\nreligious intolerance, politics. If any of you have the chance to watch it<br/>\nwith your kids, do. You won&#39;t regret it. We own this  movie, so we watch<br/>\nfairly regularly, and my son always gets something new out of it.

I loved it.  By the end<br/>\nof several rehearsals and 12 performances, I knew most of the dialog by<br/>\nheart.  That show was especially fun because Lars was on the stage crew.<br/>\nBecause the crew had to be on stage during the performance moving things<br/>\naround, they had to be in costume.  So they gave him some bit parts.  It was<br/>\nfun glancing up on stage wondering what they were going to have him doing<br/>\nthat night.  About halfway through, a couple of the kids who actually had<br/>\nparts in the wedding scene got in trouble for goofing around during the<br/>\nperformance and lost those parts.  The next night I looked up and there was<br/>\nLars holding the wedding canopy.

We used to put on &quot;performances&quot;.  There was a sliding door<br/>\nbetween the big front hall and the dining room.  We used that for a curtain.<br/>\nThe hall was the stage.  I can remember actually trying to &quot;wash that man<br/>\nright outta my hair&quot; in one of those performances. &lt;g&gt;  My kids, on the<br/>\nother hand, have not had much interest in musicals.  Even Lars, after that<br/>\nexperience, wasn&#39;t that keen to do it again.  I tried to get him a chance to<br/>\nlearn to work the lights and/or sound, but they wanted him older.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] watching old movies","postDate":"1047688526","msgId":61166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMjEwMWMyZWE4YSRjNjYwOTUwMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2Ni4xZDQ0YWY3ZC4yYmEzNjAxYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":61200,"prevInTime":61165,"nextInTime":61167,"topicId":61166,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... day ...
