We&#39;ll just have a beef week.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJackie had a play date today with a new neighbor friend.  When I picked Jackie up, I asked the neighbor what she was fixing for dinner.  She told me that they are vegetarian.  One of her boys (age 5) piped up to say that *he* was not vegetarian.  Then the mom told me that her kids &quot;discovered&quot; meat this summer at a BBQ.  So she started buying meat substitutes for them.  Jackie told me later that the girl she played with told her that she is vegetarian by choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love many non-meat foods.

That would be a great <br/>\n&gt;fieldtrip<br/>\n&gt; and it should be very easy to find vegetarian sauces and <br/>\n&gt;dressings.  &gt;As for<br/>\n&gt; protein there are lots of meat substitutes available in the frozen <br/>\n&gt;food and<br/>\n&gt; near the produce section of your regular store.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll also probably find that you need less protein than we <br/>\ntypically eat in our culture - the whole &#39;meat and potatoes&#39; square <br/>\nmeal thing. We make sure to fit in protein for sure because spaced <br/>\nout in small bits through the day it helps keep DS (and me) on a <br/>\nmore even keel but it&#39;s way way less than it used to be when every <br/>\ndinner &quot;had to&quot; include some protein (meat, cheese, etc). I kept <br/>\ntrack for a bit and we are now averaging betwen 50 and 75 grams per <br/>\nday rather than the 100+ that is typical in the overall population. <br/>\nGenerally, DS eats the most protein but then he&#39;s also growing a lot <br/>\n(a friend who sees him regularly commented this past weekend on how <br/>\nmuch he&#39;s grown in the last few months). <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the alternate grains like spelt are good plant protein <br/>\nsources. Also, even the regular grocery stores are starting to carry <br/>\npastas with protein (made of alternated grains or added in various <br/>\nways -check labels). Personally, the spelt pasta wasn&#39;t my favorite <br/>\nbut there were a couple of others that were quite tasty and even <br/>\nbetter than plain old semolina wheat pasta. And, DH even sometimes <br/>\nmakes (yup makes, my DH is a wonder) whole wheat lasagna noodles <br/>\nrather than buying the dried store kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;field trip <br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Wild Oats not all that far from us (it&#39;s a 30 minute drive) <br/>\narranged a field trip for our hs group - explained the way the <br/>\nlabelling is (organic produce is tagged with one color, non-organic <br/>\nwith another - when we go there DS insists on only the organic <br/>\ntagged items), looking for ingredients, etc. Don&#39;t know if they do <br/>\none person type tours but maybe you could talk to them and see what <br/>\ntheir minimum group is - could round up one other family maybe and <br/>\nthat&#39;d be enough or maybe just your family would be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT:Attention vegetarians","postDate":"1132083923","msgId":109886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDN0I4MzQ0MTEwRThGOC1BQTAtQjYxQ0BGV00tUjI1LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTE1LjEyMzA0Mi4yNDQ4LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTE1LjEyMzA0Mi4yNDQ4LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109885,"nextInTopic":109887,"prevInTime":109885,"nextInTime":109887,"topicId":109873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
