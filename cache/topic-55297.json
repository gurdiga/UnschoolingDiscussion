They&#39;re in mid-stream, and you&#39;ll probably have<br/>\nto listen for awhile to get the jist of their conversation.  Just read, even<br/>\nif it&#39;s only scanning through many of the emails.  After a week or so,<br/>\nyou&#39;ll easily have the discussion figured out, because most topics don&#39;t<br/>\nsurvive even a week, and you&#39;ll be able to follow it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference you&#39;ve seen info about is in South Carolina in October.<br/>\nKelly (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kbcdlovejo@...\">Kbcdlovejo@...</a>) runs it, and usually the website is in her<br/>\nsignature block.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read around a bit at the Unschooling.com website?  There&#39;s info<br/>\nthere by state which might help you hook up with people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, if you want answers to a specific question, ask away!  Hope<br/>\nyou&#39;re enjoying having your child back home.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54970,"nextTopicId":55298}}
