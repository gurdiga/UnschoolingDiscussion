I just posted because there is another side<br/>\nto the<br/>\n| story and I thought that a more narrow definition of spanking<br/>\n(versus<br/>\n| hitting and beating) would clarify the other side.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n|<br/>\n| We all know the other side, Mike.  You&#39;re not telling us<br/>\nanything new at all.<br/>\n| We know about Jesus, too.  Many here are former<br/>\nfundamentalists.  Some are<br/>\n| currently fundamentalists.  But I doubt there&#39;s anyone here who<br/>\nlearned<br/>\n| anything new about grace or Jesus or Baptists from your posts.<br/>\nBut those who<br/>\n| were already irritated with proselytization are more irritated<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| I believe that the main objection to the UN&#39;s proclamation (or<br/>\nwhatever<br/>\n| status it has) on Rights of the Child is among fundamentalist<br/>\nChristians who<br/>\n| want to protect their right to whip children.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| That&#39;s pretty embarrassing for those in the U.S. who would<br/>\nprefer for them to<br/>\n| just stop, that in front of all the other countries our country<br/>\nis saying,<br/>\n| &quot;NO, children don&#39;t have rights.&quot;<br/>\n|<br/>\n| So you came here looking for support.
