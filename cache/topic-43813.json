He was different from all the <br/>\nother bulls and his mother was just patient and understanding &lt;g&gt;.   My <br/>\noldest was a Ferdinand - always doing things in his own way and style.  So I <br/>\ngot taught right off the bat not to expect my child to do what the other kids <br/>\nwere doing - and that I needed to look at what *his* gifts, talents, <br/>\ninterests and style were/are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it may take years to see exactly where those interests and talents are <br/>\ntaking them.  It took awhile for me to get used to taking *very slow* walks <br/>\nwith him when he was a toddler and preschooler because he&#39;d look at every <br/>\nlittle speck on the ground.  It would take 5 minutes just to get to the next <br/>\ndriveway (then, later, I was surprised with the other 2 children who would <br/>\nrun on ahead of me at the same age).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat attention with the minute details of the natural world has, over time, <br/>\ndeveloped into a fascination with insects.  He&#39;s now 14, and he can spend <br/>\nhours out in the gardens very patiently looking for insects.  He remembers <br/>\neverything he reads or discovers about them - what they eat, the names of <br/>\ntheir parts, how their bodies work, their families/genus etc., what plants <br/>\nthey&#39;re typically found on, whom else they&#39;re food for (this from a child who <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t remember what we did yesterday &lt;grin&gt;).  We&#39;re having a hard time <br/>\nfinding insect guides and books that are in-depth enough to identify many of <br/>\nthe more obscure ones.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, he didn&#39;t sit still for me to read to him when he was 7 either &lt;grin&gt;.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re fairly certain that he&#39;d probably have been labeled ADD if he had been <br/>\nin school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; I can&#39;t even read to her, because we&#39;ll be reading a book, and she&#39;ll look <br/>\nat <br/>\nthe pictures and get to wanting to go see a bird, or ride a bike, or <br/>\ndo anythign that is realted to the picture.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou learn more about birds from watching them then from books.  Books can <br/>\nhelp with identification and other things, but you *really* get to know a <br/>\nbird by watching it.  For instance, many basic bird books don&#39;t mention when <br/>\nand how birds moult - which is something we learned about recently when we <br/>\nhad a bunch of really ratty looking birds at the feeder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there&#39;s lots of time to learn all sorts of things.  If she wants to <br/>\nlearn from birds rather than books, why not?  She&#39;s only 7 &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And I still need to remind myself of this with my 14 yo - because now I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling like &quot;It&#39;s only 4 years till college and how will he ever be able to <br/>\nfill out a good looking application?!&quot; - which really is a pathetic way to <br/>\nview 4 years of life.  I&#39;m working on myself - and he doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m <br/>\npanicking (at least I hope not &lt;grin&gt;)).<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2365","postDate":"1031854024","msgId":43814,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxLjIzZGVkOWVhLjJhYjIzMWM4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43813,"nextInTopic":43826,"prevInTime":43813,"nextInTime":43815,"topicId":43813,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/12/2002 10:19:12 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...
