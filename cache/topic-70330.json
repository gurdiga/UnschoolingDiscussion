But it&#39;s beginning to look like <br/>\neveryone else in the world, at least the homeschoolers and many of the <br/>\nschoolers, has gifted kids. I know because their moms tell me. Many of them <br/>\nassume my kid is too, apparently, so they&#39;re not telling me to show off. Even <br/>\nthe Unschooling moms mention their children&#39;s giftedness. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs my kid gifted? I dunno. He did really well on the one standardized test he <br/>\ntook while he was in school (enough that I pictured years of being told that <br/>\nhe &quot;wasn&#39;t working to his potential.&quot; I think he&#39;s a very talented musician, <br/>\nand sometimes when he sings he&#39;s so good I can barely breathe. I&#39;m not really <br/>\nsure why it matters one way or another, and I would think that constantly <br/>\nbeing told how &quot;gifted&quot; you are would get annoying at the least, and an <br/>\noverwhelming burden that could ultimately crush you at the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, doesn&#39;t &quot;giftedness&quot; imply that&#39;s your abilities and talents only <br/>\nyours because someone or something (God? DNA? The Gifted Fairy?) deemed you <br/>\nworthy and decided to give it to you? I suppose if you look at it from a <br/>\nspiritual perspective, it&#39;s kind of nice, especially if you take the <br/>\n&quot;everyone wins&quot; attitude and assume that Everyone is Gifted, and needs to <br/>\nfind their own gifts.
