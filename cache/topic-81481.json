To the contrary, I think her philosophy <br/>\nmeant to say the opposite, that the really crass people are those who claim <br/>\nwe &quot;owe&quot; others what we have just because we have it. Rand&#39;s writings say that <br/>\nwhen we give of ourselves because we choose to rather than because we are <br/>\nblackmailed or shamed into it or otherwise forced, then it is good for both giver <br/>\nand receiver. <br/>\n<br/>\n       The enlightenment is in understanding and accepting that it&#39;s better <br/>\nfor the giver to get something satisfying out of the experience than to be <br/>\nextorted, and that it doesn&#39;t make the giver crass just because he refuses to make <br/>\nhimself miserable for someone else. (But I read Rand at least a couple of <br/>\ndecades ago, sorry if I still am not doing her philosophy justice.) <br/>\n<br/>\n       As to &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; it&#39;s a great unschooling book imo. For <br/>\nsomeone who enjoys the kind of discussion on this list, I would think the whole <br/>\nbook rather than a synopsis would be better, so you&#39;ll get all his research and <br/>\nreasoning. And just my opinion, all of Alfie Kohn&#39;s work (that I know of) is <br/>\nvery compatible with unschooling -- ours, anyway. :) JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heidi@...\">heidi@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve just gotta point something out just a second... something that raised <br/>\n&gt; a bristling feeling...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A list-mate was defining &#39;Enlightened Self Interest&#39; where a person does <br/>\n&gt; something nice for someone else because they believe doing such means that <br/>\n&gt; something nice will happen to themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think this is an awful trap that a lot of society today falls into.
