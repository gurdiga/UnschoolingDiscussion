My youngest still isn&#39;t a<br/>\nfluent reader at 9. She can sound words out painstakingly but often<br/>\nmisses them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, she is an amazingly observant person (because she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nread). Just yesterday we were working our way through an Arthur book<br/>\nthat she wanted to try. She got tired and asked me to read it to her<br/>\nso I did. The first page said that the kids in school should line up<br/>\nalphabetically. I was reading the words, oblivious to the pictures. In<br/>\nfact, I almost never look at pictures when reading kids&#39; books because<br/>\nthe &quot;real&quot; meaning is in words, isn&#39;t it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe stops me to say: Mom the artist didn&#39;t put the kids in<br/>\nalphabetical order. See? She started listing their names and sure<br/>\nenough, they were nowhere near alphabetical. She has handwritten the<br/>\nalphabet so often that she knows the order inside out. I got such a<br/>\nkick out of her making that correlation.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe figures stuff out all the time without knowing how to read based<br/>\non visual cues that I routinely miss.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, she loves to write. She has notebooks filled with scrawl, then<br/>\nletters and now her own invented spelling. She writes! But can&#39;t read.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another ironic bit. She has learned the entire Greek alphabet<br/>\n-both upper and lower case. Because she is not bound by English in the<br/>\nway fluent readers are, she is at ease with the Greek alphabet and<br/>\nwrites all her friends&#39; names in Greek phonetics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole process of letting her learn to read without a program and<br/>\nwithout my worry or fear has been fascinating! She&#39;s a very aware,<br/>\nself-educated little missie and she hasn&#39;t read an entire book yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, she also plays games on websites and figures out how to login,<br/>\nplay the games and beat them without reading. I have NO idea how she<br/>\nmanages. But I have a hunch her skill set will be much more diverse<br/>\nwhen she finally does read because of these years of patient<br/>\nobservation and detective work.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210835993,"authorName":"Debi","from":"Debi &lt;ntd1@...&gt;","profile":"sheplusthree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Gaming Question","postDate":"1125069244","msgId":107960,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzMEYzMUJDLjUwNDA2MDRAdGVsdXMubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFmZC44YWI0NzkyLjMwNDA4OTUwQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDFmZC44YWI0NzkyLjMwNDA4OTUwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107957,"nextInTopic":107961,"prevInTime":107959,"nextInTime":107961,"topicId":107901,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know the people on this list don t have a problem with video games and gaming, so I thought I would ask here.

My fantasy life and second focus has always been the <br/>\nMiddle Ages.   Then, books were something to worship.   And our culture grew <br/>\nstraight out of that.   The development of the printing press didn&#39;t make book <br/>\ncreating easier, just enabled them to make dozens of copies of a book (and <br/>\neventually hundreds) rather than just one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow (this week and recently) I can get as many copies of a book as I want <br/>\nwithout anyone else (editor, publisher) saying &quot;Okay, that&#39;s good enough for us; <br/>\nwe want to print this.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever barriers there were between creation of a manuscript and production <br/>\nof books is gone now.   Even when there WERE barriers, lots of books were <br/>\ncrap.   The ratio of crap to carefully considered and approved by groups books <br/>\nwill never be the same.   I have a couple of freaky books from some decades back <br/>\nthat probably only exist because the author or his buddy owned a printing <br/>\npress.   I should get rid of my mainstream books and only collect freakish books <br/>\nnot worth the paper they&#39;re on.

The majority of my homeschool<br/>\ncontacts locally are pretty structured and I see them barricade<br/>\nthemselves into their &quot;school rooms&quot; every August and get so busy! It<br/>\nmakes me wonder why anyone would go to all that trouble if they didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to, as well as, maybe I&#39;m not doing enough because we don&#39;t do<br/>\nthat every August (or May, either, when they are so intent on<br/>\n&quot;finishing&quot; their expensive curriculum).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT--my 8 year old has learned to read, especially since I decided<br/>\nlast year to be &quot;serious&quot; about unschooling, or as I told her--no more<br/>\npushing!
