I do believe the<br/>\ndamage being done is very different, but I&#39;m also not so sure the hitting is<br/>\nsometimes worse. I can remember two separate (thank you Sandra!) occasions<br/>\nas a child when I was struck by my mom. I remember them both well. Although<br/>\nthe first one I can&#39;t remember what I did to get spanked.  It was<br/>\nhumiliating for me. And although I can remember them, I&#39;m not so sure after<br/>\na while they were traumatic for me. I remember lots more of what has been<br/>\nsaid to me. I had a much harder time dealing with those words, and some<br/>\nstill very much with me today, than the hitting. Maybe it was how I was as a<br/>\nchild, maybe it was that there were only two occasions and nothing on a<br/>\nregular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also look into my adult life and know that I was in a very verbally<br/>\nabusive relationship. He never laid a hand on me to hurt me, but the verbal<br/>\nabuse was so bad that there were times when I would just think in my head<br/>\nthat I wished he would just hit me and get it over with. Then it would be<br/>\nover instead of continuing for hours and even days. And just to clear up<br/>\nthat thought, I had been in a physically abusive relationship before that<br/>\none, and for me, it wasn&#39;t half as bad. Maybe I&#39;m just weird.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even though I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s always worse, I do not believe in hitting<br/>\nof any kind to &quot;discipline.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"Julie Solich","from":"&quot;Julie Solich&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","profile":"foxymophandlemama32","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: RE:spanked or threatened or punished","postDate":"1067689011","msgId":83562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWMzYTA3MiQwYjFiZTgwMCRiNzZkMzJkMkBtYXJrPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFhYi4xYzQzN2NjYy4yY2Q0Njk1MkBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDA1MTAxYzNhMDIxJGM1OTdjYTEwJDJkMDBhOGMwQGxhdXJhZGVhdmhtanZmPg=="},"prevInTopic":83561,"nextInTopic":83580,"prevInTime":83561,"nextInTime":83563,"topicId":83561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... do a worse damage than the physical abuse.

I don&#39;t feel bad when I remember those times-I<br/>\nnever have. I do remember most of the hurtful or careless comments that came<br/>\nmy way however. It has always been the things people have said to me that<br/>\nhave scarred me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have smacked my kids. (Don&#39;t anymore and NEVER will again) But I have<br/>\nalways been very careful about what I say. Even when my husband and I were<br/>\nhaving serious marital problems I would try so hard to be careful about what<br/>\nI said  because I have found that words stick and I never wanted to say<br/>\nanything I didn&#39;t mean or would regret saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe because I have  tried  hard to be truthful and kind, I have assumed<br/>\nthat others are the same, and if so why wouldn&#39;t every nasty thing ever said<br/>\nabout me be true. Sorry,  I&#39;m thinking out loud here. I&#39;ll go and think<br/>\n&#39;quietly&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
