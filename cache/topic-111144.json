We are a HUGE Star Wars <br/>\nfamily (sometimes I forget that there are people who&#39;ve never seen <br/>\nthem). Although my dh liked the movies as a kid, *I&#39;m* the one who <br/>\nhas all of the original trading cards, t-shirts, lunch boxes, action <br/>\nfigures, buttons, ships, etc.  We watch the movies all of the time. <br/>\nIn fact, when my mom bought me the original trilogy on video 14 years <br/>\nago for Christmas (which started the annual tradition of watching <br/>\nStar Wars on Christmas Day), I actually *wore out* the video tapes. <br/>\nNow, of course, we have them all on DVD and are forever breaking out <br/>\ninto scenes (with each family member saying the lines, word for word, <br/>\nof a particular character). Our friends and family all think we&#39;re <br/>\nnuts ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich leads me to what we&#39;re doing right now.  After reading some of <br/>\nthe Star Wars: Episode 1 Encyclopedia, my 10 y/o son set the book up <br/>\nby his (massive) collection of legos to use the pictures as a basis <br/>\nfor the podracers he wanted to build. After building them and racing <br/>\nthem accross the dining room floor, he&#39;s now playing his PS2 <br/>\npodracing game. <br/>\n<br/>\nCarri Ann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111137,"nextTopicId":111148}}
