This wasn&#39;t unschooling, but I didn&#39;t have to take the course <br/>\nagain.  I wanted to learn this information, and the text book and <br/>\ncollege class was one route to do so.  It was a personal quest.  I was <br/>\nmore proud that I had learned something so hard for me, and the path to <br/>\nlearning that was through a book, through a text book and a formal <br/>\nclass.  The class was no longer about a grade or credits toward my <br/>\ndegree.  In fact, the D was not removed when I earned the B, it became a <br/>\npart of my gpa, and the D itself never bothered me, it was more a <br/>\nchallenge to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorta rambling, but I think my point is that there are many ways to <br/>\nlearn.

But I guess I do want to say something else though :)  I&#39;ve seen some children want curriculum because they believe that is the only way to really &#39;learn&#39; something.  I think there in lies the issue for me.  My kids have never been in school and are still relatively young but they don&#39;t even know what a workbook is, they might do them if I got them but I guess I don&#39;t think it is the best way to learn.   I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m making sense.  My youngest is really into multiplying.  She likes to count and just discovered multiplying is a short cut.  I could get excited and get a work book with multiplication tables.   She might do it, but instead we just find examples in our daily life (they are everywhere) and she practices the skill that way.  This also allows her to develop her own &#39;system&#39;, it doesn&#39;t put my system or someone else&#39;s system on her as the &#39;right&#39; way.  What I have found is that her system makes sense to her and thus is easier and more effective for her.  A workbook wouldn&#39;t know that.   I think it is part of my letting go of &#39;schooly&#39; thought to not rush out for workbooks or classes when an interest is shown - be it in music, language, dance or math.  There are times that may be appropriate but for me, it just isn&#39;t the first thing I go to.  There are so many ways to learn, more effective ways IMHO :) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnna <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198239998,"authorName":"joylyn","from":"joylyn &lt;joylyn1@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] re: math ...was back again","postDate":"1096754861","msgId":100140,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNUYyNkFELjMwNDA5QGNoYXJ0ZXIubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxYjEwMWM0YThjMCQyOTgzM2I3MCQ2ZjYzMDgwNEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwLjM1MGYzNmViLjJlOTA1YmFmQGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMWIxMDFjNGE4YzAkMjk4MzNiNzAkNmY2MzA4MDRAeW91cm8wa3drdzlqd2M+"},"prevInTopic":100139,"nextInTopic":100141,"prevInTime":100139,"nextInTime":100141,"topicId":100139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s fun and he asks me to do some &quot;math&quot; every now and then.  It has lots of manipulatives like little counters bears, trucks, dinosaurs, that kind of thing.  It has some picture book connections and it was fun when I was doing it regularly (I think we got to page 10 with my attempt at scheduling math time &lt;g&gt;, so I guess it might not of done it the &quot;right way&quot; for long) .  Now, I don&#39;t do anything with it unless he asks.  And he sometimes does.  We just go to the next page of activities and do it until he wants to stop or he flips around it the giant teacher&#39;s guide of activities and says &quot;that one looks fun&quot;.  Then we play with the stuff.  It is all activity type stuff and games which he loves, not many worksheets at all.  So, he likes it.  I&#39;m kind of glad to use it a bit since I put out some money on it.  But, it is all on his terms and when he wants it.  Mostly we play with the manipulatives it came with.  He&#39;ll ask, what does the book say to do next?  I&#39;ll read it and he&#39;ll either want to do it or he will have a better idea and we do that instead.  I guess it&#39;s not unschooling in the way that it is a purchased curriculum, but it&#39;s only by choice and only because we happen to have it around and it is fun to play with.  Like another game on the shelf.  We aren&#39;t following any type of plan, by any stretch.  I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t buy another one unless he requests something like that.  Funny, I should of had a hint that we didn&#39;t really need a curriculum because when I went through the list of Kindergarten objectives, he already knew 90% of them, just from everyday living.  So I ordered First Grade (again, this was awhile ago).  He&#39;s five btw.  Kind of an ah-ha moment that I missed.  Hhmm, just from playing and doing things, he learned the objectives for his &quot;grade level&quot;.  Hhmmm, maybe that is the way to go with learning.  No, I better pay $200 for this kit instead.  HELLLLLLO!  Better late than never with that ah ha!  Sure wouldn&#39;t mind having that $200 back though.<br/>\nLaura <br/>\n(btw, I&#39;m was a public school K-1 teacher for 8 years, so I think I&#39;m doing pretty good at deschooling myself with that considerable handicap)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100173,"nextTopicId":100147}}
