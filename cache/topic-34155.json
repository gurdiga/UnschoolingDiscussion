I have become <br/>\naware of conversations I need to have with my kids and of options <br/>\nopen to us all, as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seeking an unschooling perspective because this is the kind of <br/>\natmosphere / lifestyle I would like to create in our home.  <br/>\nSpecifically for us, an atmosphere where our children feel their <br/>\nopinions are valued, they are trusted, and they really love <br/>\nlearning.  (I do not always succeed & so these lists/reading/etc. are <br/>\nhelping me to continue moving in a positive direction.)  (...for our <br/>\nfamily!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how much personal info. we are supposed to share (or <br/>\nnot) on the list, but we have been foster parents for 5 1/2 years.  <br/>\nOur three amazing kids were adopted at various stages during this <br/>\n51/2 year adventure, and all experienced multiple forms of abuse.  <br/>\nOne event the other night summed it all up for me; my daughter was <br/>\nlaying in my bed talking to me about her day.  She suddenly burst <br/>\ninto tears and said, &quot;I can&#39;t be myself or I won&#39;t be wanted&quot;.  We <br/>\ncried together and talked about all the things we have talked about <br/>\nso many times over the years - how precious and unique she is, how <br/>\nnone of the things that happened to her were her fault, how <br/>\nincredibly she is loved and cherished by us.  (Her comment was in <br/>\nregards to an incident at a group activity earlier in the day.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so important to me that my actions communicate acceptance to my <br/>\nchildren.  Unfortunately, no matter what I say, too many people in <br/>\nher short life so far have sent her the message, &quot;you are not wanted <br/>\nhere, welcome here, good enough&quot;.  This is her current interpretation <br/>\nof the actions of most of the important adults in her life so far <br/>\n(natural parents, aunts & grandparents who were relative-foster <br/>\ncaregivers, teachers, caseworkers, and even us - she was our first, <br/>\nand we made BIG mistakes in our first year of parenting, in the form <br/>\nof consequences and reward systems.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSoooo, I guess when it comes to taking classes where they might be <br/>\ntold their drawing isn&#39;t &quot;good enough&quot;, and told this 5-7 times, I <br/>\nhave mixed feelings about letting my child participate.  I feel like <br/>\nI am sending a message of &quot;I don&#39;t trust you, you can&#39;t choose for <br/>\nyourself&quot; if I don&#39;t let Gino sign up for the class, and I feel like <br/>\nI am allowing more messages like, &quot;your best isn&#39;t good enough&quot; to be <br/>\nheaped on his consciousness if I do let him participate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am becoming more well-informed thanks to the discussions on this <br/>\nlist - thank you again for taking the time to share your opinions / <br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs my grandfather passed away last night, I won&#39;t be able to check in <br/>\nfor about a week.  We&#39;re heading from Chicago down to Texas.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34149,"nextTopicId":34159}}
