She is a nice<br/>\nlittle girl who lives only a couple miles from our house.  The little girl<br/>\nhas come here a couple times and the girls went to her house last night for<br/>\ndinner and to play for the first time.  It all went very well. She lives<br/>\nwith her grandparents and I&#39;ve met them and they are very nice and pretty<br/>\nlaid back.  But I find some of their conversations very funny/enlightening<br/>\nbecause they come from such different background/expectations.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were in the computer room at my house one day and the girls were playing<br/>\nwith their Breyer horses.  I was sitting at the computer and they played on<br/>\nthe floor behind me.    My 8 yo filled one of the troughs with water and put<br/>\nit in the pasture fence on the rug.  The little friend kindly told her she<br/>\nprobably shouldn&#39;t do that because she might get in trouble if it spilled.<br/>\nDd replied, it&#39;s not milk, we can just put a towel on it wipe it up if it<br/>\nspills.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they came home last night from their play date, they were happy and<br/>\ntalking and bubbling with excitement.  It was a pretty site.  They spent a<br/>\nfew minutes telling me everything they did and what they ate.  Later on dd8<br/>\nsaid that her friend asked her how many worksheets she does per day.  Dd<br/>\ntold her that she didn&#39;t do any.  And her friend asked her how she learned.<br/>\nShe told her she learns by loving horses and figuring out what to buy them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCute.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106144,"nextTopicId":106138}}
