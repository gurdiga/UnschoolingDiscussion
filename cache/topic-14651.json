Please don&#39;t take offense, but isn&#39;t this an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; list???  I have not seen a post yet that had to do with unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know. Unschooling to me means learning from life, that there is no<br/>\n&gt; clear delineating between &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;, that learning can<br/>\n&gt; happen anywhere and everywhere. Every post on this list is about life and<br/>\n&gt; learning, and although some of the topics will not appeal to each of us,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found that overall there is much to be learned from the wisdom on<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; list.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14648,"nextTopicId":14660}}
