The winter solstice marks the start of winter and<br/>\nis the shortest day of the year (time between sunrise and sunset). It has a<br/>\nvery scientific and mathematical basis which makes it easy to calculate the<br/>\ndate thousands of years in the future (or past), but means that when<br/>\nconverted to our calendar, the date seems to shift and can fall in a range<br/>\nfrom late January to mid February.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, Feb 9, 2005 is the start of the Lunar New Year and it will be The<br/>\nYear of the Rooster. Unlike our New Year celebration, the Lunar New Year<br/>\ncelebration lasts several days. Although the first 5 days or so are the most<br/>\nimportant, the celebration actually ends with the full moon 15 days after<br/>\nthe start and is marked with the Lantern Festival.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Jing Ying Institute (in Arnold/Severna Park area of Maryland) is<br/>\noffering several free activities for a Chinese New Year Celebration that is<br/>\nalso a Tsunami Relief Fundraiser. Starting on Friday, Feb 11, from 7:30 to<br/>\n9:00 pm, you can take a free Tai Chi class. A $5 donation is suggested to go<br/>\nto the fundraiser. On Saturday, Feb 12 from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, we will<br/>\nhave Lion Dance performances at various times during the day, martial arts<br/>\ndemonstrations, an indoor yard sale, a bake sale, a kick-a-thon at noon, and<br/>\nmany other activities. Funds raised will go toward the Tsunami relief<br/>\nefforts of Mercy Corps, a highly rated international charity with an<br/>\nextremely high efficiency rating and reputation for high-impact rapidly<br/>\ndeployed aid programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to help with the yard sale or bake sale (provide items,<br/>\nwork at the tables, or help with set up or clean up), or help in any way,<br/>\nyou can join the e-mail list by sending a message to<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TsunamiReliefFundraiser-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">TsunamiReliefFundraiser-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to sponsor a Greer in the kick-a-thon (Billy, Glen or<br/>\nLane), we will be doing 200 kicks and pledges can be as low as a penny per<br/>\nkick. Just e-mail us directly at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun@...\">fun@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also help just by attending and enjoying the events we are offering.<br/>\nWe are located about half way between Baltimore and Annapolis and directions<br/>\ncan be found at www.JingYing.org. If you happen to find a great bargain at<br/>\nthe yard sale or something yummy at the bake sale, remember that your<br/>\npurchases will be helping the people in SE Asia who were affected by the<br/>\nTsunami and won&#39;t have as much to celebrate this Lunar New Year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\nwww.JingYing.org<br/>\nwww.FUN-Books.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m delighted to see someone post on an Asian new year <br/>\n&gt; celebration.  And I can&#39;t resist the opportunity to remind <br/>\n&gt; everyone that this new year calculation is indeed based on a <br/>\n&gt; lunar calendar created by the Chinese, *and* it is celebrated <br/>\n&gt; by many ethnic / national groups in East Asia, including the <br/>\n&gt; Koreans (Sol Nal), and the Vietnamese (Tet). </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102758,"nextTopicId":102683}}
