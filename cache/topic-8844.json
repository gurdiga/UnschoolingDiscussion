My question is, If you  replace them<br/>\nwith alternative sweetners aren&#39;t there potential effects of these? Of<br/>\ncourse, I realize the ideal thing is not to even use these, but I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nI can give up soda (tisk, tisk on me). Anyway I&#39;d appreciate info on this.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 02, 2000 9:56 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Rice syrup<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hey Julie... Sweet cloud rice syrup looks something like honey.  The<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Hypoglycemia/Diabetes Cope Book&quot; has a lot of recipes in it that call for<br/>\n&gt; this sweetener, so I just got some a few days ago, and just tried it<br/>\n&gt; yesterday in oatmeal cookies.  Even though they were not as sweet as cane<br/>\n&gt; sugar, to me , they taste very good.

In the article, it explains that it tastes like sugar,<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; no aftertaste, or chemical taste.  It is not high glycemic, and will not<br/>\n&gt; affect blood sugar levels adversely.
