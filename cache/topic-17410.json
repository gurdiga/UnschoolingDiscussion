What I find attractive about unschooling is that it&#39;s flexibility - we<br/>\nlearn to recognize and *respond* to our differences. How one family<br/>\nunschools SHOULD be different (even if those differences are subtle and<br/>\nminute) from how another family does it because we are different from each<br/>\nother. It is not some rigid &#39;plan&#39; of dos and don&#39;ts that we do or dont&#39; do,<br/>\nor policies that we must follow. I think that it is a trap that is easy to<br/>\nfall into when we attach labels to what we do. It is for that reason that I<br/>\noften hesitate to label how we, as a family, learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your articulate post!<br/>\n<br/>\nNina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 19<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thu, 29 Mar 2001 07:54:53 -0800<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;DiamondAir&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: another tv question<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:louisaem@...\">louisaem@...</a><br/>\n&gt;&gt; Personally I believe that limiting any interest does not reflect the ideals<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of unschooling.  My TV is on all the time and my kids would rather do just<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about anything else.  During the summer they rarely watch because we are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; outside so much.  When I suggest an activity they show NO hesitation to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; leave<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the TV.  Even when it&#39;s on they are usually doing something else.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmmm, I&#39;d have to say I respectfully disagree with this one. Unschooling to<br/>\n&gt; me means child-led learning, it does not mean that I give my kids free reign<br/>\n&gt; to do whatever they want whenever they want to. There are things in life<br/>\n&gt; that we limit, because of our own principles. For instance, in our family<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;re vegetarians, we boycott all Nestle products, we don&#39;t allow toy guns<br/>\n&gt; in our house, we ride our bicycles instead of taking our car, we buy almost<br/>\n&gt; everything second-hand, and we don&#39;t watch TV. All of these things, we<br/>\n&gt; believe are for the overall health and well-being of our family and/or for<br/>\n&gt; the health and well-being of our earth.and other people. Are we not<br/>\n&gt; unschooling because we&#39;re vegetarian?? Not unschooling because we won&#39;t buy<br/>\n&gt; our son a mini replica Uzi? Not unschooling because we don&#39;t watch the<br/>\n&gt; television? Not unschooling because our kids have to bicycle instead of<br/>\n&gt; riding in the car? To me, unschooling is not a list of things we do or do<br/>\n&gt; not do, it&#39;s a mind-set that allows my children to learn by following their<br/>\n&gt; own interests instead of being told what to learn, when, and where. I<br/>\n&gt; *don&#39;t* believe that means I have to allow them access to every single way<br/>\n&gt; to learn things. Sure, they could learn anatomy and human sexuality by<br/>\n&gt; watching porn movies. They could learn about hurricanes by watching TV.<br/>\n&gt; Both, *I personally* believe are damaging. And why do I think TV is<br/>\n&gt; damaging? Because young children don&#39;t have the mental context to place the<br/>\n&gt; images they see in. Sure, my son might be watching a show about hurricanes,<br/>\n&gt; but he will also see commercials where it is implied that you need this,<br/>\n&gt; that, or the other product in order to be happy in life. He will see ads for<br/>\n&gt; things that we are not going to buy (for frugality and earth-saving reasons)<br/>\n&gt; and that until that point he didn&#39;t know existed (thus making his life and<br/>\n&gt; ours so much happier, not to know about all the things you can&#39;t have :-).<br/>\n&gt; He will also see ads for other programs with guns blazing or scantily clad<br/>\n&gt; people pawing each other. At some point in his life, he&#39;ll be able to put<br/>\n&gt; these images in a context, but it&#39;s pretty clear that right now all they do<br/>\n&gt; is cause him concern, judging by the way he&#39;s reacted when he&#39;s seen them.<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s an extraordinarily sensitive child and I&#39;d like to see him keep his<br/>\n&gt; &quot;magic&quot; for a few more years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also think it&#39;s dangerous to generalize from one&#39;s own personal<br/>\n&gt; experiences to every other person. I hear people say &quot;We have candy out all<br/>\n&gt; the time and my kids never touch it&quot;, or &quot;we have the TV on all the time and<br/>\n&gt; my kids rarely watch it&quot;. Well this is great, and it may work quite well for<br/>\n&gt; those individual families. I also know families that have candy out all the<br/>\n&gt; time and their kids are 40 pounds overweight. And I know families<br/>\n&gt; that have the TV on all the time and the kids are glued to it like<br/>\n&gt; little sponges for 7 hours a day. So much depends on individual kids and the<br/>\n&gt; preferences and innate personalities they were born with, as well as the<br/>\n&gt; family environment. All of this &quot;it&#39;s unschooling to do this&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; unschooling if you do that&quot;, &quot;some people CALL themselves unschoolers but<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re really not&quot;, etc. (not just responding to this particular post but<br/>\n&gt; to many in the same vein) remind me of my high school punk rock days. It was<br/>\n&gt; &quot;punk&quot; to do this, but &quot;poser&quot; to do that. I could never keep it all<br/>\n&gt; straight and I still can&#39;t. If I wasn&#39;t &quot;punk&quot; because I wore Birkenstocks<br/>\n&gt; with my mohawk, and I&#39;m not &quot;unschooling&quot; because I limit TV, well so be it<br/>\n&gt; I guess :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt; -Robin-<br/>\n&gt; Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was going to grow up to be a<br/>\n&gt; weirdo&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17462,"nextTopicId":17442}}
