Kids and dad,  standing, tapping their feet,  &quot;OK, Mom,  lets go, we&#39;re ready!&quot;               <br/>\n <br/>\nI really think the part about how important it is for new unschoolers to spend lots of time with their kids and really listening and &#39;being&#39; with them was so great.         So often when my kids were absorbed in something I would then think,  &quot;OK, now this is when I can go get something done.&quot;           Well,  that would also be the exact time that I could be learning the most about my child.      I learned that from that discussion!<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is a great read.      Thanks to those of you who participated!

That word probably sums my 10yo daughter up best. She has always been this way.

She has always <br/>\nbeen this way. She doesn&#39;t like people telling her what to do, she questions <br/>\n(argues) everything. We had a very difficult time while I subjected her to <br/>\npublic schooling from preschool through half of fourth grade, until she <br/>\nstopped a year ago. She never listened to authority, didn&#39;t give much effort <br/>\nat doing homework and paying attention, she would spend more energy getting <br/>\nout of boring tasks. And I tried being drill sergeant with her all along. It <br/>\nnever worked well. I finally came to my senses and found out about <br/>\nunschooling. I decided to be positive about my unique child. I use positive <br/>\nadjectives to describe her &quot;difficult&quot; personality traits, and don&#39;t engage <br/>\nin arguments as much anymore. I have curbed my perfectionistic attitudes. I <br/>\nbelieve unschooling works, and it has helped me be a better parent. She is <br/>\nrebelling from unschooling now. Is that even possible? She wants to return to <br/>\nschool. She wanted to at the beginning of this school year, and believing in <br/>\ninterest-led choices, I was going to let her, but she changed her mind. She <br/>\nwants to go again(next fall). I am reading The Teenage Liberation Handbook, <br/>\ntrying to gain perspective, but she doesn&#39;t want to hear about any of it. She <br/>\nwants to go to 6th grade, junior high. She wants a locker, to change classes, <br/>\nplay in the band, see her friends. I can relate, I was so excited about <br/>\nstarting junior high(7th grade). Now she wants me to play teacher with her. <br/>\nShe wants me to dole out tedious assignments so she can get used to being <br/>\nordered around. It is almost amusing the way she begs &quot;why can&#39;t you just <br/>\nmake me do something!&quot; But it&#39;s not funny. I have acquired such a distaste <br/>\nfor anything schoolish, and have explained my role as facilitator to her. I <br/>\ntry to help her brainstorm. I try to give her tools for self discovery. She <br/>\nsays she is lazy and wants me to tell her what to do. I am afraid the <br/>\nprogress I have seen over the past year was a mirage. I am afraid she still <br/>\nthinks she will be stupid if she doesn&#39;t go to school and someone doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntell her what she needs to know. I have deschooled myself more in the past <br/>\nyear than she has. I have waited patiently for her to get excited about <br/>\nlearning again, and it was finally happening. Now this. Most of all she wants <br/>\nto just fight with me. She wants to do the extreme opposite of what I think, <br/>\nand has always been this way. I am not sure what to do. I have been ignoring <br/>\nthe attitude and vicious words, but she just gets worse. Slamming doors, <br/>\nrolling eyes. She acts like she hates me, because I DON&#39;T make her go to <br/>\nschool. I told her she can stay in her room until her meanness passes. I had <br/>\nher at 19, so I am a pretty young mother that has gained more confidence in <br/>\nthe past few years. I know I have made countless mistakes with her, and have <br/>\nreally felt we have made up for so much being together in the past year. What <br/>\ncan I say, she is so much like me. Extreme thinking, gets caught in negative <br/>\ntraps where nothing pleases her. Sensation-seeking, drama-making, and her <br/>\ncurrent tirade against me. She is trying to use her school choice against me. <br/>\nShe said if I get her a cellphone, she won&#39;t go to school. (her 13yo cousin <br/>\ngot one for Christmas, I have no idea why, but I am not in favor of a child <br/>\ntoo young to drive having a cell phone) <br/>\n<br/>\nGive it to me honestly, trusted mentors. I thought I was handling it well and <br/>\nwas seeing positive results. She really has come a long way in some areas, <br/>\nwill this little rough patch pass? I know she is bored and we haven&#39;t been <br/>\nable to get out much with the constant snow advisories.....well she has now <br/>\ncome back asking to start the day over, wanting to do a project with <br/>\nme......If I can get any practical feedback just from the little info I have <br/>\ngiven today, to avoid further power struggles, I would be so grateful. <br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\nUnschooling mom to<br/>\nMegan(10) Ashlyn(3) Christian(1.5) <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;UNO Unschoolers Network of Ohio&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;\">http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Links Page MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59521,"nextTopicId":59524}}
