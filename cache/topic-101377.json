My first college experience was <br/>\nat Antioch, a 4 yr liberal arts college in Yellow Springs Ohio. The <br/>\nbasis of their &quot;program&quot; is the co-op, and students spend half of <br/>\ntheir college experience in far-flung locations ranging from organic <br/>\nfarms and animal sactuaries, to democratic elementary schools, to <br/>\nresearching endangered species in the rainforest. Unfortunately i got <br/>\ntoo homesick to even be away at college, so i dropped out before <br/>\ngoing on co-op. Yes, its an extremely expensive school, but i got <br/>\nlots of financial aid when i went there, the bulk of which was just <br/>\n&quot;forgiven&quot; tuition (not a scholarship in which i would have to <br/>\nmaintain a certain GPA or take specific classes.) My family was <br/>\npretty solidly middle class and i know that kids in &quot;poorer&quot; families <br/>\ngot more financial aid. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I would recommend very seriously looking at less expensive college <br/>\n&gt; choices and trying classes a few at a time (or even 1 at a time) <br/>\n&gt; before putting up the money for a degree program.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the important thing is to find a college that is the right <br/>\nfit for what you are looking for. And &quot;going to college&quot; doesnt have <br/>\nto mean packing all your stuff, moving halfway across the country, <br/>\nand signing on for the 4 yr degree program. Going to college can mean <br/>\ntaking a class or two in the evening at the local community college, <br/>\nor even the local university. (I know this depends on where you live. <br/>\nWhere i live in Michigan there are tons of 4 yr universities within <br/>\ncommuting distance.) That&#39;s why i suggested the teenager look over <br/>\nsome college classes and see what sparks her interest. One of the <br/>\nbest college classes i ever took was one called Evolution and <br/>\nBehavior, and was about how animals&#39; genes influence their behavior <br/>\n(including humans). It was at the local CC, and the professor LOVED <br/>\nhis subject. I mean he was obsessed with it, and you couldnt help but <br/>\nlove it along with him. I would never have thought that psychobiology <br/>\nwas a field i&#39;d get into until this class. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing i wasnt prepared for when i went back to school (community <br/>\ncollege)as an adult, was how distracting and immature alot of the <br/>\nother students were, who had come straight from high school and didnt <br/>\nseem to want to be there.  I found that evening or saturday classes, <br/>\nin which there were more working adults who were trying to balance a <br/>\njob and/or family obligations, and who really wanted to *be* there, <br/>\nwere more satisfying to me at the time. Just a caution for an <br/>\nunschooled teenager who might not be so accustomed to being <br/>\nsurrounding by others for whom &quot;compulsory education&quot; extends into <br/>\ncollege due to pressures from family/society. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157311507,"authorName":"Linda","from":"Linda &lt;eaglefalconlark@...&gt;","profile":"eaglefalconlark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: college, was HSLDA - Was -Unschooling Vs Homeschooling","postDate":"1101397964","msgId":101405,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMTI1MTU1MjQ1Ljk5OTU1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwMjA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNvNGlubCtpMG1lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101402,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":101404,"nextInTime":101406,"topicId":101377,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... figure out what you like, and what you don t.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-460141459\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;Part of the reason for going to college is to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>figure out what you like, and what you don&#39;t.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, as far as that which is included in the college<br/>\nsystem and the career choices it supports.

Perhaps it <br/>\nwould have been different if I had gone to a less expensive school <br/>\nor actually been encouraged to try lots of different classes &quot;on for <br/>\nsize&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to CWRU, an expensive private school that ran about $22,000 a <br/>\nyear. When I chose the school, many things factored in, including <br/>\nmajors offered, college size, etc., but mostly I went because it was <br/>\nclose, my brother was already there, and I did not know I had other <br/>\noptions. I enrolled having earned many scholarships based on my high <br/>\nschool record and test scores. <br/>\n<br/>\nUNfortunately, you need to keep a certain GPA to maintain <br/>\nscholarships.

(3.6 GPA required to keep the <br/>\nmoney)I wound up having the largest scholarsip amount lowered after <br/>\nthe second year when my GPA fell to a 3.4 and lost a science <br/>\nscholarship completely when the government cut the funding.
