It&#39;s their bread-and-butter.<br/>\nIt&#39;s their legacy, their baby, their sacred cow. People in Education are<br/>\nthreatened greatly by homeschoolers. Especially their pride.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important for homeschoolers to be sensitive to the fact<br/>\nthat there *is* good stuff happening in public education ~ in some<br/>\nplaces. There *are* teachers who &quot;get out of the way&quot; (as John Gatto put<br/>\nit) thereby allowing students to truly learn. But they are the exception<br/>\nand not the norm. <br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, public education is America is dying a slow, painful death.<br/>\nIt&#39;s top heavy. I heard someone say the other day that the public school<br/>\nsystem in the United States is going to collapse beneath the weight of<br/>\nitself. How true. How many Superintendents and Assistant Superintendents<br/>\nand Principals and Assistant Principals (the list goes on and on) are<br/>\nthere in *your* school district? It&#39;s *unreal* the number of people it<br/>\ntakes to &quot;do&quot; school. I can&#39;t figure out what 98% of them actually do.<br/>\nAnd then there&#39;s the Education Department in Washington ~ don&#39;t get me<br/>\nstarted! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that there *are* public school teachers who believe in<br/>\nhomeschooling and support it, but must do so covertly. I have a very<br/>\ndear friend who has taught English at our high school for years. She&#39;s<br/>\nwonderful, one of those teachers you remember all your life because she<br/>\ntruly cares. She supports my decision to homeschool my 16yo and<br/>\nunderstands my feelings. She realizes that she, and others, are<br/>\n&quot;trapped&quot; in the system. So, she just does the best she can, and she<br/>\ngives 200%. Rare, and lucky are the public school students who get her<br/>\nas a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy school district here in SC is *very* averse to homeschoolers. Every<br/>\nschool district is different. I think it depends on the general makeup<br/>\nof the community. Here, every other person I meet or go to church with<br/>\nis either a schoolteacher or works for the school or is related to<br/>\nsomeone deeply engrained in the school system. They look at<br/>\nhomeschoolers as the enemy. Too bad they&#39;re not concerned about the<br/>\neducation of *all* people in their district.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Unschooling. It&#39;s not what we do, it&#39;s how we think.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise, a Tea Lover in South Carolina<br/>\nStop by for a cup of tea ~ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover\">http://www.angelfire.com/sc/tealover</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":136,"nextTopicId":532}}
