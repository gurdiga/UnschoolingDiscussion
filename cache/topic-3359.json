There were a lot<br/>\nof holes in the prosecution&#39;s case, however, and she is still making<br/>\nappeals.  There was a lot of public sentiment behind her among those who<br/>\nwere following the trial.  There are also a lot of questions surrounding<br/>\nthe fact that her ex was a former police officer and there was something<br/>\n(bad) going on between him and his former colleagues.
