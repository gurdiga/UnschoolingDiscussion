We&#39;re all enjoying that he&#39;s <br/>\nreally enjoying learning how to cook.  He&#39;s actually very good and isn&#39;t <br/>\nafraid to try complicated recipes that require an array of skills -- a <br/>\nrecipe for fisherman&#39;s pie required sauteeing, chopping, pureeing, <br/>\nmaking a pastry crust, making a white sauce.  He&#39;s learned to make an <br/>\nawesome stir fry vegetables with rice, fetucinni carbonara, veggie <br/>\nlasagna.  He&#39;s had to create the menus and shop for the food.
