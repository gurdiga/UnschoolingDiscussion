They never commented on it to me, but <br/>\nthey&#39;ve always been the type to live and let live -- they raised us <br/>\nthe way they saw fit and our kids are our business.  I expect no <br/>\nless from others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 7 yo dd was the one who didn&#39;t say &quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot; to her horse<br/>\n&gt; trainer and the trainer had &quot;never been so disrespected.&quot;  Oh,<br/>\n&gt; but my dd was so respected by being called names by her?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I was saying, Marshall talks about the right/wrong mentality in <br/>\nhis work, and for a Southern gal brought up in a Christian home -- <br/>\nthis is a whole new concept to me.  Not only in the way that the <br/>\ntrainer treated your daughter, but in the way that dd responded.  I <br/>\nwas inclined to agree with you as one who prides herself in <br/>\nencouraging the kids to be independent thinkers who take no guff <br/>\nfrom anybody.  Then I came across this passage in an NVC book called <br/>\nthe &quot;Compassionate Classroom&quot; (sounds kinda schoolish, but Marshall <br/>\nRosenberg was well-acquainted with John Holt and his work.)  It <br/>\nreminded me of this thread, so I was intrigued to see that it was <br/>\nright up front when I came looking for it.  Here&#39;s the excerpt:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- For example:  A teacher says to a student, &quot;I think you&#39;re just <br/>\nbeing lazy by not finishing your work.&quot;  The child replies, &quot;You&#39;re <br/>\nmean!&quot;  This defensive response is the only way this child has <br/>\nlearned to deal with the pain of unmet needs for respect and <br/>\nunderstanding.  His response is not likely to meet his needs; in <br/>\nfact, the teacher may give him a trip to the principal&#39;s office or <br/>\nsomething else that addes to his pain.  If, instead of name calling, <br/>\nthe child [and/or trainer, as the case may be] has learned to <br/>\nidentify his needs for understanding and respect, he will probably <br/>\nfind ways to respond that are much more satisfying to him and to the <br/>\nteacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in the first place, the teacher had been aware of his own needs -<br/>\n- perhaps to understand what is really going on with this student -- <br/>\nhe could have expressed his feelings and needs something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When I see that your project isn&#39;t finished on the day you said it <br/>\nwould be, and I see you working on something else, I&#39;m puzzled.  I <br/>\nwould like to understand what stopeed you from completing your first <br/>\nproject?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen teachers [trainers, parents, etc.] learn to identify their own <br/>\nneeds, they are empowered to act in ways that are satisfying to <br/>\nthem.  When teachers learn to identify the needs of their students, <br/>\nthey are empowered to contribute to their well-being.  And, whether <br/>\nteachers realize it or not, the behavior they model to students is <br/>\nthe behavior that students model in relationship to each other.  The <br/>\nresult is that when teachers pay attention to the needs of students, <br/>\nstudents start paying attention to the needs of each other, and this <br/>\nis the beginning of a truly cooperative, compassionate learning <br/>\nenvironment. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf an entire society of people learned to pay attention to their own <br/>\nneeds as well as the needs of others, we would be on our way to <br/>\ncreating a world that has the potential to work for everyone. [End <br/>\nexcerpt.] -=-<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe the simple words can really help in some situations,<br/>\n&gt; as you said.  It can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be applied globally to all situations.  Had my daughter been<br/>\n&gt; (barf)respectful in the trainer&#39;s eyes, I would have been real<br/>\n&gt; worried about her self esteem.  It would have been an acceptance<br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s ok for her to be called names.  That could lead to a life<br/>\n&gt; long acceptance of abuse.  It wouldn&#39;t be OK for her future husband<br/>\n&gt; to call her names, etc.  The &quot;disrespected-ness&quot; that the trainer<br/>\n&gt; felt, I am sure, is really more just being embarassed because she<br/>\n&gt; was outclassed by a 7 yo girl.  That is the way dh and I see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, I believe that Marshall would agree that the trainer was <br/>\ndefinitely embarrassed, and so was your daughter amongst other <br/>\nthings, like intense frustration and disappointment.  Does that <br/>\nsound right?  The whole exchange was what Marshall calls a &quot;tragic <br/>\nexpression of unmet needs.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe trainer doesn&#39;t sound like she&#39;s up to learning new tricks, but <br/>\nI could be wrong.  The beauty of NVC is that it only takes one <br/>\nperson to make a difference, and the language is very empowering to <br/>\npeople of all ages, from what I&#39;ve observed (No ma&#39;ams or sirs <br/>\nrequired.)  As I&#39;ve said before, I discovered a reference to <br/>\nNonviolent Communication in an archived article at Mothering.com and <br/>\ngoogled it to find the Center <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnvc.org\">http://www.cnvc.org</a> -- There&#39;s a <br/>\nwealth of information on their website if anyone&#39;s interested in <br/>\nchecking it out.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes you have to stand up for yourself and take the road<br/>\n&gt; less traveled.  I am glad my dd did.  Sometimes instead of saying<br/>\n&gt; &quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot;, it is a necessity to say &quot;no, I don&#39;t agree with you&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and walk away.  Now let&#39;s talk about freedom of speech ;0) krista<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Marshall works with warring factions all over the world, and manages <br/>\nto show them that it&#39;s not really necessary to agree to disagree, <br/>\nwalk away, or even kill somebody to meet their needs.  He tells the <br/>\nstory of talking to a group of Palestinian Moslems in a refugee <br/>\ncamp -- they found out he was American and things got a little <br/>\nheated as you can imagine.  There&#39;s a surprise ending which shows <br/>\nthe power of words to make a difference in the first chapter of his <br/>\nbook, which is online at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnvc.org/bookchap.htm\">http://www.cnvc.org/bookchap.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, we came across the beginnings of this thread <br/>\nafter visiting our local stables for the first time back a couple of <br/>\nweeks or so.  The manager was getting on to a young rider in the <br/>\ntypical fashion, telling her not to kick the horse, to do it <br/>\nthe &quot;right&quot; way, carrying on & on in between wrapping up our <br/>\nconversation, and finally hollered out, where are your shoes?!  The <br/>\nkid smiled a sheepish grin and rode on in her sock feet and I <br/>\nrealized this one belonged to the manager.  She confirmed that it <br/>\nwas her own child ignoring her admonitions.  I thought twice about <br/>\ngetting into that kind of situation even before I saw this thread <br/>\ncrop up...

They","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1826850867\">I was thinking about this past thread, I think on this list...<br/>\n<br/>\nMany kids, lucky kids, are taught by their parents to show respect in a <br/>\nmultitude of ways.  They show it with body language, with tone, with eye <br/>\ncontact, with words, they don&#39;t need to use yes ma&#39;m.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there are children out there who have not had that upbringing.  <br/>\nTo them, learning to use &quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot; (or sir) is huge.  It&#39;s not really <br/>\nabout respect, but instead it&#39;s a cue, a hint, that helps them get into <br/>\nthe mode...oh, this is authority, I need to respect that, to show that <br/>\nrespect with my body, my tone, my eye contact.  This concept has to be <br/>\ntaught to these poverty kids, it&#39;s not taught at home, and in most cases <br/>\nit&#39;s a more valuable skill than reading or math.  I have students who <br/>\ndon&#39;t know when to stop arguing, stop talking.  I can cue them into <br/>\nsaying &quot;yes ma&#39;m&quot; and this can make the difference.  Kids get shot, <br/>\njailed, because they don&#39;t know how to show respect, and these simple <br/>\nwords can really help...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor many of our kids, they are an extra.  For some kids, they are vital. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103244,"nextTopicId":102764}}
