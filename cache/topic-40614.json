In (name your state), the<br/>\nfailure follows the national pattern. The school system is not doing its<br/>\njob. Taxpayers¹ money is being wasted while the children are being denied an<br/>\neducation. More money will not change it. Sending kids to suburban schools<br/>\nwon¹t change it because all the public schools in the state are run by the<br/>\nstate Department of Education by the same rules, methods and mandates and<br/>\nall offer the same poor quality schooling. It&#39;s bad by design.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The public schools are failing everywhere because they don¹t have<br/>\neffective programs; they have no standards and no goals; they use inferior<br/>\nmethods for instruction  (i.e., ³Whole Language² a proven failure instead of<br/>\nPhonics a proven success); their bad teachers are virtually impossible to<br/>\nfire thanks to the power of the teachers¹ union; the system has a captive<br/>\naudience of consumers instead of parents with choices. The situation allows<br/>\nthe schools to fail without losing any customers or funding. In fact, the<br/>\nworse the schools perform, the higher their funding gets. The Hartford CT<br/>\nschools prove that -- they are among the nation¹s worst, and yet their per<br/>\npupil cost is among the nation¹s highest.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Government school systems are bureaucratic monopolies with one constant<br/>\nobjective: to enlarge their budgets. Their structure and practices guarantee<br/>\npoor performance. There are no incentives to improve the schools; no rewards<br/>\nfor good teaching and no penalties for incompetence. The system can blame<br/>\nits customers and ³society² for its own failures -- that¹s convenient but<br/>\ndishonest -- while its cry remains, ³Give us more money.² Taxpayers are its<br/>\ncaptives; the children are its victims.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40586,"nextTopicId":40559}}
