This unschooling group was begun many <br>years ago by a husband \n  and wife named Peter Bergman and Susan Shilock. They <br>are Holt devotee&#39;s \n  who have 5 or 6 children and have backgrounds in child <br>development when \n  they found out about Holt, et al. <br><br>I am not entirely sure of the \n  complete history of &quot;Open Connections&quot; as the <br>group is called. Presently, \n  they have &quot;classes&quot; (for lack of a better term <br>from me at the moment) \n  daily, somedays two different themes. For example, the <br>two days my \n  daughter goes. . .one day is called Open Forum. . . on this day <br>the kids \n  (age range is 7 to 12) are free to choose from a variety of things <br>to do. \n  . . they can play outside all day, they do woodworking projects, they <br>have \n  a &quot;shop&quot; complete with cash register and counter which they really love, \n  <br>tons of puzzles, games, manipulative things, etc. They have made taffy a \n  few <br>times, etc. etc etc. There are facilitators there and parents are \n  invited to <br>volunteer their area of expertise. I know another day is called \n  &quot;Tutorial&quot; <br>which is probably more formalized, but I do know right now they \n  are doing a <br>play in that group. There is a group that is called &quot;Day on \n  the Farm&quot;. OC (as <br>we call it) with a huge financial donation that is \n  on-going has been able to <br>buy a 27 acre piece of property complete with \n  old farm house that will house <br>the group next year and on. The group is \n  devoted to choice and self-directed <br>learning. It does costs to go . . \n  .this is how Susan and Peter make their <br>livelihood as well as employing \n  the facilitators, but I cannot imagine a <br>better place for my kids to go a \n  couple of days a week. It gives my daughter <br>the social outlet she needs, \n  and allows her to see others like herself <br>learning at their own pace. \n  <br><br>I read this today from something Peter wrote about the new place they \n  were <br>able to buy, and this may give you a sense of what we have here. . \n  .&quot;This is <br>literally a dream (vision) come true. Ever since I first \n  conceived of my <br>desired end product back in 1967, when I read A.S. Neil&#39;s \n  <i>Summerhill &nbsp;</i>and <br>imagined my ideal situation, I have held a \n  close version of &nbsp;our new site in <br>my mind. It&#39;s almost eerie how \n  similar the new property is to the image that <br>I&#39;ve held for over thirty \n  years. When I first drove down the driveway, I was <br>spooked by the sense of \n  deja vu. I didn&#39;t have to wonder why. The present was <br>merely the future \n  come to life.&quot; <br><br>I moved here to PA with my new husband (after living \n  all my life in the <br>south) and have not been thrilled with a lot of things. \n  But the awesome <br>opportunity to be in this incredible group of people who \n  unschool (or <br>something close to it) is worth the sacrifices I have made. \n  Whenever I think <br>about moving away from here, I cannot imagine going back \n  to a place where I <br>don&#39;t experience this kind of support. <br><br>My \n  husband just read your question and he said. . . well, we don&#39;t do \n  <br>anything exactly in unschooling, right? :) He is learning about it as we \n  go <br>along, albeit a bit reluctantly at first. His parents are retired \n  <br>schoolteachers (over 35 years). <br><br>Anyway, a bit long winded I know, \n  but I hope it explains it somewhat. <br><br>lovemary <br><br><tt>Message \n  boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>To \n  unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br><br>Another \n  great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> \n  <br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your use of Yahoo!

His parents are retired \n<br>schoolteachers (over 35 years). \n<br>\n<br>Anyway, a bit long winded I know, but I hope it explains it somewhat.\n<br>\n<br>lovemary</font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"R Meyers","from":"&quot;R Meyers&quot; &lt;livinglighthouse@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"femAoVF0w1vtcZCxjmyrYLLh3R1q9xpLXWbR6zdkOu6tKIbMO4ej69p68TUZ56omS3gWY29vBQcb4Lj-zudx8FvoL6EsGF3p_WXNI1av","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What exactly do you do with your kids?","postDate":"987631429","msgId":19115,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWMwYzg1MyQ3Mzk1OWVjMCRlZDlhODVhY0Bjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ2LjEzYWFlYTM5LjI4MGYzY2U2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19084,"nextInTopic":19121,"prevInTime":19114,"nextInTime":19116,"topicId":19019,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"lovemary, I would love to hear about your unschool group that gets together......what do you guys do exactly???

They all have to help around <br/>\nthe house, although the older three do a lot more.  We have tried many <br/>\ndifferent approaches, including the one where we just do things as we see <br/>\nthey need to be done, but we ended up going back to our chore cards.  I cut <br/>\nindex cards in fourths and wrote every chore I could think of, including ones <br/>\nthat always got skipped before.  Three days a week, we have to pick 6 of the <br/>\ncards.  The other days, we just do the bare minimum.  None of us like <br/>\nhousework much but we all agree that the house has a depressing atmosphere <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s messy so we just try to find the easiest way.<br/>\n     We have separate laundry hampers for me, Matt (their Dad), each of the <br/>\nthree oldest, and then the 9 and 4 yr olds share one.  I wash mine, often my <br/>\nhusband&#39;s, and usually the youngests&#39;, although sometimes I&#39;ll tell one of <br/>\nthe older kids to stick their clothes in the washer.  The older ones wash and <br/>\nput away their own clothes and that is one thing I don&#39;t have to tell them to <br/>\ndo because they find themselves running out of clothes.  We also each have <br/>\nour own dish colors (we have those solid color ones) so the three older ones <br/>\nwash their own and sometimes I&#39;ll say to wash Sean&#39;s or Ryan&#39;s with theirs <br/>\n(those are my two youngest).<br/>\n     I would probably have my 9 yr old help more but he is very delayed in <br/>\nhis fine motor skills and also in some of his overall logic so I have to <br/>\nchoose things that he can handle.  However, he is getting better at <br/>\nunderstanding things.<br/>\n     We have TVs but we don&#39;t have cable or satellite so we only watch movies <br/>\nand not very often, except for my younger two.  With them, I do sometimes <br/>\nlimit it to one movie a day because I have found that my 9 yr old doesn&#39;t do <br/>\nwell with too much TV/movie viewing and would watch it all day if I let him.  <br/>\nWe also limit video games to a couple of times a week.<br/>\n     We used to go to bed later and get up later but lately we&#39;ve been going <br/>\nto bed by about 9 and getting up between 5:30 and 6:30.  This is something I <br/>\npushed but only for a few days until the new mental alarm clock kicked in.  I <br/>\ntold the kids that I felt like it was a waste for us to be burning the lights <br/>\nlate into the night and then sleeping through some of the morning light, plus <br/>\nI have read that it&#39;s healthier for people to go with the natural light and <br/>\ndark cycles because it goes with our natural melatonin production.  And we <br/>\nall do feel a lot better this way now that we&#39;re used to it.  Plus my husband <br/>\ngets to see us before going off to work, on the days he works.<br/>\n     All of this probably sounds too regimented but the reality of it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave that feeling.  I basically believe in giving kids a lot of blank, open <br/>\ntime because they naturally fill it in with things that interest them.  But I <br/>\nfind that TV can mess up this process and has a hypnotic effect, so that <br/>\ndays/weeks/months can go by watching things you could actually care less <br/>\nabout.  I have experienced this with myself when we had TV and I&#39;m not even a <br/>\nTV lover.<br/>\n     These are just our ways of doing things, not what I think everyone needs <br/>\nto do.  We all try for what works best for our personalities, ways of living, <br/>\netc.  But since you asked for specifics, that&#39;s what I aimed for.

I am not a<br/>\nhousekeeper, I&#39;m an unschooler! We all do housework.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are they just free to run and have no requirements<br/>\n&gt; on them at all? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, they have to tell me where they&#39;re going, see if<br/>\nit&#39;s ok, do their chores regularly. Erik does his<br/>\npaper route. Aubrey has art and piano lessons. We do<br/>\nvolunteer work together.<br/>\n<br/>\ndo they have wake and sleep times<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that are set?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not really. We have a pretty structured evening:<br/>\ndinner, family walk, chores, reading aloud, quiet time<br/>\nin rooms. But they tell us when they want tucking in<br/>\nand lights out. If we fall asleep before they ask for<br/>\nlights out, there&#39;s no tucking in, so they&#39;re pretty<br/>\naware of when we seem to be bedding down for the<br/>\nnight. Because they really want their tucking in!<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat about computer time and tv time<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is it regulated ? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have no cable, and in this area, that means no tv<br/>\nchannels. For computer, no it&#39;s not regulated, except<br/>\nI recently made a rule that says &quot;computer games are<br/>\nfor people with clean rooms.&quot; The rooms are a lot<br/>\ncleaner, and there&#39;s been no resistance to this rule.<br/>\nVideos, they just say, &quot;Can I watch a video?&quot; and I<br/>\nsay sure or I say if your room is clean. This isn&#39;t a<br/>\nrule. They just always have asked.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> this is about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the older kids 14,12,10 then we have a 2 and 9mo<br/>\n&gt; they help me out with alot!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have way too many people in your family to do all<br/>\nthe housework on your own! They need to help! It might<br/>\nwork better if they each had areas of responsibility<br/>\nso you didn&#39;t have to nag them. My son is in charge of<br/>\nkeeping the living room tidy. He also sweeps the<br/>\nkitchen after dinner each night (we all contribute to<br/>\nthe meal: I cook, dh does dishes, dd sets and cleans <br/>\nthe table). And during reading aloud, he folds one<br/>\nbasket of laundry. My daughter feeds the pets, sets<br/>\nand cleans the table, and is in charge of keeping the<br/>\ndining room tidy. The kids have their own bathroom,<br/>\nand I just point out when it&#39;s trashed. I do the<br/>\ntoilet cleaning and stuff, but they have to pick up<br/>\ntheir own bath toys and towels and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how do you balance house keeping with everything<br/>\n&gt; else and are your children self motivated in any way<br/>\n&gt; to help with the house? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;re not self-motivated, but neither am I. :)<br/>\nNot about housework.
