I know that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have all the answers -- and I value his questions.  Sometimes the <br/>\nquestions come at times when I don&#39;t have access to reference tools  (in <br/>\nthe car, at the park, etc.) or when I don&#39;t have time to drop everything <br/>\nand look it up.  So we have a question book -- it&#39;s just a composition <br/>\nbook that we write down the burning questions in.  When we first started <br/>\nhomeschooling, I felt I had to get *every* single question written down <br/>\nand answered.  Then I realized that he didn&#39;t always want me to <br/>\nperseverate on every single question until it was answered.  So now we <br/>\ndecide if the question needs to be written down or if we can just leave <br/>\nit aside and if we remember to look it up later, we do.  If not, no big <br/>\nwhup.  Sometimes, I&#39;ll just suggest a resource where he might find the <br/>\nanswer.  As in, &quot;Gee honey, I don&#39;t know what the chemical composition <br/>\nof the sun is, but you might be able to find out the answer by going to <br/>\nthe NASA website, or maybe by looking in the encyclopedia.&quot;  Later on, I <br/>\nmight say, &quot;You asked a really good question about the sun. Were you <br/>\nable to find out the answer or did you want me to help you look into it <br/>\nfurther?&quot;         <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, his being able to formulate questions and keep probing <br/>\ndemonstrates that he&#39;s thinking and learning. Sometimes a standard <br/>\nanswer is not appropriate to what he&#39;s looking for.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlicia    <br/>\n                <br/>\nShelly G wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is what scares me about Unschooling (quick<br/>\n&gt; &gt; re-intro: I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; researching h-schooling/ unschooling for my 3 yo? so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got 3 yrs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to decide!).

And she used to <br/>\nbring boxes of books from the state library in Santa Fe so we weren&#39;t limited <br/>\nto the school&#39;s library (which wasn&#39;t really too bad, as it was a 1-9 school <br/>\nat that time) and the little city library (very small).  She said after the <br/>\nspace age will be the information age.  I didn&#39;t know what that could <br/>\npossibly mean.  I do now!  She said electronics would make a difference.  She <br/>\nsaid we would be able to buy a calculator we could hold in our hands that <br/>\nwould run on batteries, and for less than $100.  That was 1964.  I thought <br/>\nshe was nuts!  But within about 15 years, I got a solar-powered calculator <br/>\nfree for subscribing to Newsweek.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in high school the alternatively-trained teachers were already <br/>\nshowing up in the schools.  They were on the same bent--nobody can know <br/>\neverything there is to know, because information is coming along daily.  <br/>\nLearn how to follow it.  Learn to be selective about sources and the media.  <br/>\nLearn to be critical thinkers so you can discern good sources and evaluate <br/>\ninformation on your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in college I was mostly a hide-in-library English major, but I was <br/>\nstudying psychology too, and how learning works, and how language works.  The <br/>\nteacher training classes I took for certification had to do with the rapidly <br/>\nchanging world and they said helping them learn to learn is the best thing <br/>\nyou can do.  When you say &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; show them how you find the answer, <br/>\nand broaden their worlds beyond school and textbook information, because <br/>\nthose textbooks are probably five years old already anyway.

Darin came home tonight with the announcement that <br/>\ndid I know that the Kansas primary is tomorrow? (Well, yes hon, I know. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot the apolitical one in the house!) And he wanted to know who I would be <br/>\nvoting for. So I told him who I had chosen as my pick for the race and why, <br/>\nwhen Moly asked why I had to pick someone to race. So I started to explain to <br/>\nher about primaries and how if you are Republican you vote for one person out <br/>\nof two or three to be the person you want to run for Governor (or <br/>\npresident...) and the same goes for if you are a Democrat. She wanted to know <br/>\nif you got to vote if you weren&#39;t Rep. or Dem. and I told her no, the <br/>\nprimaries are for the major parties, but then said I wasn&#39;t quite sure about <br/>\nthat one, so we would look it up. She wanted to know what party I was going <br/>\nto. I explained about choosing a party and what the word party meant in this <br/>\ncontext. She then wanted to know why I had to vote now for one guy and then <br/>\nvote later in November for maybe him or maybe someone else. This one took me <br/>\nawhile to explain, but she finally decided it sounded like the reality game <br/>\nshows she has seen on TV, and I agreed.  We mainly watch our DSS system so <br/>\nshe hasn&#39;t seen the political adds and I read the local paper online and she <br/>\nwanted to know how I decided who to vote for. So I took her to the computer <br/>\nand we went to the candidates page at the paper online. I showed her who I <br/>\nwas voting for and explained why by reading to her his statements compared to <br/>\nthe other two gentlemen. I showed her that one of the candidates didn&#39;t give <br/>\nmuch information, and how he is a Mayor of another city in the state and his <br/>\nrecord hasn&#39;t been the greatest. I showed her how the third man was basically <br/>\nuninformed on the issues, how he was very ridged and didn&#39;t come across as <br/>\nbeing very willing to work with others. Then she wanted to know why I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to vote for the one woman gubernatorial candidate, and I explained that <br/>\nshe was a Democrat and since I registered as a Republican I had to choose a <br/>\nRepublican candidate to vote for. Then I explained that even though I had to <br/>\nchoose a Republican now, in November I could choose to vote for anyone and <br/>\nwould probably be voting for the woman candidate. Moly wanted to know how I <br/>\nknew she would be a person to vote for in November so I explained how she was <br/>\nthe only Democratic candidate, so there would be no contest in the primary <br/>\nfor her. Moly said &quot;So she gets to pass go and collect her $200?&quot; (That&#39;s <br/>\nwhat we say when someone gets a freebie in our house.) It surprised me that <br/>\nshe had such a good grasp on the idea. Then she wanted to know why, if I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t planing to vote for the man I am voting for now in November, would I <br/>\nvote for him now. So I explained how I still felt it was important for me to <br/>\nhelp choose the best man for the race, how I believed that it was important <br/>\nto have good people running for everyone to choose from later. <br/>\nMoly seemed to have a good grasp on the voting process, she was interested <br/>\nand I thought she asked really good questions. <br/>\nThis is why I feel unschooling works best. If I had a curriculum and the <br/>\nlesson on government and voting had come up at some preselected time, she <br/>\nmight not have been as interested. The ideas wouldn&#39;t have had the impact <br/>\nlike they did since we were talking about it using real life examples in the <br/>\nhear and now. So maybe we may or may not ever cover the Cuban Missile Crisis, <br/>\nbut I believe that we won&#39;t miss any *all important* issues because I see my <br/>\nkids being inquisitive, energetic learners. They want to know things, they <br/>\nwant to be part of life. And that is why unschooling works. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New Question from a Newbie","postDate":"1028606639","msgId":39915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4ZS5iZWUwYjEyLjJhODBhNGFmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39902,"nextInTopic":39918,"prevInTime":39914,"nextInTime":39916,"topicId":39870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/5/2002 3:32:18 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...
