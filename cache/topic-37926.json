He grew up with only the labels of <br/>\ntroublemaker, smartass, and JD. He spent years as a heroin and then a <br/>\nmethadone addict. He spent years in prison. I&#39;m sure if he were in the <br/>\nschool system as a child now, his labels would be more like ADHD, Dyslexia <br/>\nor SID. Kinder maybe? Yes. Helpful? I don&#39;t think so. They would still be <br/>\nlabelling what was wrong with instead of celebrating what was right with him<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was bright. VERY bright. He was charming beyond belief. His passion as a <br/>\nchild was making scale models of buildings he knew and visited. As an adult <br/>\nhe was a leiutenant in the Fire Dept., generous to a fault and owned his own <br/>\nbusiness. He went to his death still unconvinced that he was a worthy soul. <br/>\nA perfect being.

And they LOVED him fiercely in spite of it all. They didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to reach him. No one ever told them it was okay to be <br/>\nunconventional. They didn&#39;t know how to let go and help him move with his <br/>\nstrengths.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do. I know that I can label my kids&#39; with places they can improve and <br/>\nhold that in my heart as part of Who They Are, or I can let it go. I can <br/>\ncelebrate and talk about what makes them good and right and special. Even in <br/>\nthe midst of flying tantrums and teenage moods. I can reassure them day <br/>\nafter day that Who They Are is all they need to be. They can change some <br/>\nbehaviors, they can challenge their minds, they can buff up their bodies. <br/>\nBut in the end they are Who They Are and that&#39;s good.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

She was six.  The school sent her to be tutored at<br/>\na certain time in the afternoon while the other students did regular reading<br/>\nin the classroom.  I had no idea at that point what kind of damage this was<br/>\ndoing to her self-esteem and her love of books, but the simple act of<br/>\nlabeling her a &quot;slow reader&quot; started her on a downward spiral.

She&#39;s nearly 12 now and while she&#39;s not a &quot;perfect&quot; reader, she does<br/>\nread for pleasure and makes out just fine.  She&#39;s heavy into Shel<br/>\nSilverstein right now, and has such a love for satire.  When I think of how<br/>\nwe&#39;d likely be struggling and fighting were she still in the system, it<br/>\nmakes me cringe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think labels sometimes make people more comfortable because they confirm<br/>\nthat something is really *wrong* and the differences in the child aren&#39;t<br/>\nanyone&#39;s fault.  But why do a child&#39;s differences have to be someone&#39;s<br/>\nfault?  Why can&#39;t they just be seen as something unique about the child?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just to clarify, I&#39;m speaking of learning differences, not physical<br/>\ndifferences.

That label that I <br/>\ninitially embraced (so that I could say &quot;It&#39;s not my fault, it&#39;s this rotten <br/>\ncondition&quot;) did nothing for him but justify adults at the school treating him <br/>\nlike a weirdo and imbecile. They dumbed down his work and radiated lowered <br/>\nexpectations like some sort of cancer. The parents followed their lead, and <br/>\nthe children followed the school adults and parents&#39; lead. At one time we <br/>\ntried  Ritalin. He became an obedient miserable unimaginative robot. Ritalin <br/>\nmade us realize the wonderful side of his so-called condition, because <br/>\nsuddenly that brilliant spark was absent. Over the years I&#39;ve met many kids <br/>\nlabeled as ADD, and the only thing that they all seem to have in common is <br/>\ntheir individuality. Yes, they can be frustrating, but that is because they <br/>\nrefuse to behave like servile sheep. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough we are doing a sort of eclectic school at home I am fascinated by <br/>\nthe unschooling philosophy and perhaps someday I&#39;ll have the guts to try it. <br/>\nI believe that if we had unschooled from the beginning it would have been a <br/>\ngood thing.

Make them <br/>\nconceited? Make them think that their own particular kind of intelligence is <br/>\nwhat counts and that the really WONDERFUL car mechanic we have is somehow <br/>\nless gifted because he has a different kind of intelligence?  I can&#39;t see any <br/>\ngood coming from labelling them with anything at all - as unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d use more descriptive words for REAL traits, instead. In the case of <br/>\ngiftedness, I have a child with extraordinary interpersonal intelligence and <br/>\nI have ALWAYS talked to her about her amazing ability to understand people <br/>\nand their behaviors and motivations, etc. She has always needed to talk about <br/>\nit a lot because it is NOT always easy to have much greater understanding of <br/>\nhuman behavior than everyone around you. We don&#39;t call her &quot;gifted&quot; - but we <br/>\nmight talk about what its like to have such understanding as she has. Another <br/>\ndaughter loves language - words, meanings, foreign languges, and all kinds of <br/>\nliterary expression. We don&#39;t call her &quot;gifted.&quot; We just know that she&#39;s <br/>\ninterested in words and languages and we support that. Labelling her wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nchange how we live because we support and facilitate her own particular <br/>\nspecific way of being.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe traits that, put together, are called ADD are still just personal, <br/>\nindividual traits and not all kids or adults have all of them and they can be <br/>\nexpressed very differently in different people. As a parent of a kid with a <br/>\nlot of those traits, I&#39;d want to read the ADD literature, etc., to get ideas <br/>\nand support. But I wouldn&#39;t want my children to have that label in their <br/>\nheads anymore, maybe less, than I&#39;d want them to have the &quot;gifted&quot; label in <br/>\ntheir heads. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would use the traits my child actually has -- when talking to my child <br/>\nabout her own personality and behavior - but not the label. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59327,"nextTopicId":59170}}
