I&#39;ve been <br/>\nteaching my older kids ASL and would like to teach him that, rather than <br/>\nobscure, made up signs.  Although, we do stick with whatever he comes up <br/>\nwith.  For example, his sign for ball is to raise his arm over his head and <br/>\n&#39;throw the ball down&#39;.  It works and I know exactly what it means, so we <br/>\nstick with that.  He also grabs his diaper when he is wet or dirty so that&#39;s <br/>\neasy to recognise, too.  We are working on need signs right now...eat, <br/>\ndrink, sleep, etc.  Those are usually the things he has a hard time with <br/>\n(anger, frustration), especially when I am distracted by other things.  <br/>\nAlthough he will come grab my hand and lead me to the fridge or to his bed <br/>\nhere and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone else doing ASL with their kids?  We are having such a blast with <br/>\nit.  The first sign we did was soda....I told the kids we were going to play <br/>\na game and they had to learn to sign it if they wanted a Coke and BOY, we&#39;ve <br/>\ngot a million little hands signing soda all the time!  LOL  Now they are <br/>\nbegging me for signs for everything!  They love trying to learn signs *I* <br/>\ndon&#39;t know to throw me off.  It has really been a wonderful time for us all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
