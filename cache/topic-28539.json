When she was smaller, I made<br/>\npicture cards of the things we bought every week. When<br/>\nwe got into an aisle, I would give her the picture<br/>\ncards of the foods on that aisle and she would pick<br/>\nthem out.

To be consistent, wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nthe blame for a child&#39;s outburst lie on the child<br/>\nalone? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand this comparison. A parent is an<br/>\nadult (ie. fully mature - we like to hope). A child<br/>\nhas minimal life experience and limited maturity (I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming we&#39;re talking about fairly young children<br/>\nhere - they&#39;re the ones I see having tantrums in<br/>\npublic). Children&#39;s outbursts can be caused by a<br/>\nmyriad of things (hunger, tiredness, illness, anxiety,<br/>\netc.). It&#39;s up to the parent to be aware of their<br/>\nchild&#39;s needs and to take care of those needs before<br/>\ngoing into a public place (ie store) if they want to<br/>\navoid a tantrum. That&#39;s how I understood  Kathy&#39;s<br/>\npost.  And who said that there needs to be consistancy<br/>\nbetween a child&#39;s actions and an adults? There aren&#39;t<br/>\nany societies (that I know of) that expect the same<br/>\nbehavior of children as of the adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;I am in charge of how long we <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stay, and when they get food. If I am not planning<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ahead for their <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; needs, they don&#39;t have much choice.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sure they do.  Everyone, child or adult, has a<br/>\nchoice in how they behave.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain we get back to the maturity issue. I think most<br/>\nof us will agree that small children do not always<br/>\nhave the mental or verbal skills to clearly<br/>\ncommunicate (or even recognise) their needs.<br/>\nTherefore, they are not *choosing* their behaviour.<br/>\nThey are *reacting* to their feelings at the time. If<br/>\na 2 year old is hungry and mom stops to run one last<br/>\nerrand, does he have a choice? Can he get himself home<br/>\nor something to eat? No, he depends on mom for that<br/>\nand if she&#39;s not attending to his need then he may<br/>\n&#39;blow&#39;. That is what I interpreted Kathy&#39;s post to<br/>\nmean.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Parents<br/>\nhave had many years of experience in life to help them make judgements<br/>\nabout their reactions in any situation.  Kids are still figuring it out. <br/>\n Parents usually call all the shots too, about when to stop for food, <br/>\nhow many more stores to go to,  what kind of behavior is acceptable in<br/>\nthe car, in the store.  Having no control over an already disagreeable<br/>\nsituation wouldn&#39;t be any fun.   I still say expecting adults to act like<br/>\nadults isn&#39;t out of line.   I think parents bug kids infinitely more than<br/>\nkids bother parents.

Other times, the other kids are just so cruel about any differences they hurt my kids&#39; feelings, and my kids lash out. My 4y is working on not hitting or screaming when he&#39;s angry, but sometimes the other kids are just so mean or rude I am amazed. I try to supervise his playtimes, because many parents on the block just let their 3y and up run around outside and play without anyone watching them. One even told me they are old enough to know how to behave they don&#39;t need her watching them. Her 4y son started hitting my 4y son, and my son hit back, so the kid ran in to tell mommy and she told us it would be better if we played elsewhere. No kidding. My 6y daughter likes to play cars (&quot;boy&quot; stuff) and dress up (&quot;girl&quot; stuff), but many of the girls exclude her (cliques), and so do the boys(&quot;no girls allowed&quot;). Maybe it&#39;s because they are all in school, or maybe she doesn&#39;t like being bossed around or teased. It&#39;s not always bad, but I had higher hopes for the neighborhood.

I m sorry I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-585343351\">I have to disagree with the statement below.  No, not every child or <br/>\nadult has a choice in how they behave.  We can not ignore medical <br/>\nconditions.  I&#39;m sorry I keep bringing this up, but, with my family, <br/>\nthis is very applicable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, let&#39;s not forget severe PMS.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedical problems aside, I&#39;m not sure I would want my child to act one <br/>\nway when he feels another way.  If s/he is angry about something, for <br/>\nexample, I think the healthiest approach for the parent to take is to <br/>\nallow that child his anger.  If his angry behavior bothers someone, they <br/>\ncan always just go away.  The child&#39;s emotions should be respected.  Me, <br/>\npersonally, I&#39;m not into repression.  I was repressed for many years as <br/>\na child and I don&#39;t want to do the same thing to my children.  It&#39;s very <br/>\nharmful, especially to the more sensitive children.  Children have <br/>\nfeelings too and they should be allowed to express them honestly and <br/>\nopenly.  Young children also don&#39;t have as much control over their <br/>\nbehavior as adults do.  If they&#39;re upset about something, they can&#39;t <br/>\nalways express themselves verbally, so it will come out another way.  We <br/>\nneed to respect that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, November 26, 2001, at 08:41 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure they do.
