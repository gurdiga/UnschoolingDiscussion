Follow the kids is the best idea I can give you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere were some things that we did back a few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nListened to Gary Paulsen&#39;s book &quot;Hatchet&quot; on tape while traveling to a living history museum; after that, the kids were interested in getting other books by him for them to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use LOTS of books on tape --- they are great starting points for discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving history museums are great --- Saint Marie Among the Iroquois is up in Syracuse. Across from that is an old Salt Mine (that takes only about 10-15 minutes to go through).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the kids loves creating games with playing pieces (made of Sculpey); both the kids went through a stage (after playing with the different board/playing piece settings on Chessmaster 5000) where they were working on their own chessboard/playing pieces tailored to their own interests/personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use movies, live theater shows, different productions of the same show sometimes to enjoy and then make comparisons among the different performances. (We&#39;ve also done this same thing with books when they were younger. There are so many versions of &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; --- one of the &quot;Pigs&quot; ones is even told from the wolf&#39;s point of view. This is a fun thing to do as a family.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, one of the kids was very into building machines --- a catapult, a trebochet, candy dispenser for m&ms, small race car; also designing/bulding forts and boats.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth kids have made artwork (using computer) for t-shirts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAstronomy (borrowing a telescope), rocketry, geology (exploration of creek bed), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nChemistry sets are fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheater makeup is great for exploration.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriendship bracelets, tie-dying, crochet, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107371,"nextTopicId":107395}}
