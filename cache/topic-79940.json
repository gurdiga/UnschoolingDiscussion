It hasn&#39;t been easy and it has been very intentional, not<br/>\nunschooling at<br/>\nall, but he was in such misery that it was worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe OT was prescribed for his sensory issues but we found it most helpful in<br/>\nthe skills it taught him to recognize what inputs his body needed and how to<br/>\nseek them appropriately.  An example, when he was younger he had a real<br/>\nproblem<br/>\nwith giving everyone ferocious hugs and running up and slamming his body<br/>\ninto<br/>\npeople as a way to say hi.  Now a small 6 yo giving a ferocious hug to an<br/>\nadult was not much of a problem but to his peers it appeared to be very<br/>\naggressive behavior and a lot of them were scared of him.  What the OT did<br/>\nwas teach<br/>\nhim to label that need, it is for deep pressure and it is a way the nervous<br/>\nsystem is seeking to organize itself.  It is a real physical need that he<br/>\nfelt but<br/>\nshe taught him other ways to meet that need.  One of the best ways was<br/>\nbouncing full body flat on a trampoline.  We learned ways to help him with<br/>\nit also,<br/>\nI would physically lie on top of him with most of my weight.  Believe it or<br/>\nnot it was just what he needed.  Now he knows to do isometric exercises and<br/>\njump<br/>\non his pogo stick and various other ways to get that need met, ways that are<br/>\nmore socially acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he learned how to regulate his own stress, he learned to be more<br/>\nempathetic to others.  His mind used to be too full of its own noise and<br/>\nneeds.  As he<br/>\ngrew more empathetic he was able to learn social skills that had eluded him<br/>\nand he began to develop friends.  He is now sought after by the other boys<br/>\nin<br/>\nthe neighborhood, but he still has trouble playing with more than one person<br/>\nfor<br/>\nany length of time.  Luckily he has learned to know that and recognize and<br/>\nclaim that so he just tells his friends that he wants to do his own stuff<br/>\nbefore<br/>\na crisis occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things we did to help him learn mastery of his body was to do tap<br/>\ndance<br/>\nfor several years, Tae Kwon Do, gymnastics and now ballroom dancing.  He<br/>\nreally enjoys the ball room dancing most of all.  I think it appeals to his<br/>\nbudding interest in the opposite gender.  He told me, half in horror and<br/>\nhalf in<br/>\nwonder, &quot;They want you to touch the girls in dancing.&quot;  He is such a sweet<br/>\ninnocent some times.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is very philosophical about his tics.  He basically feels that if people<br/>\ndon&#39;t like him because of his tics, they probably weren&#39;t people he wanted<br/>\nto<br/>\nbe friends with anyway.  In public we have developed a code of sorts so that<br/>\nI<br/>\ncan alert him if he is ticing a lot and he can choose how to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Depakote(seizure meds) have stopped some of the larger tics, but he has<br/>\na<br/>\nlot of smaller ones.

Sometimes we think Douglass is OCD,<br/>\nhe<br/>\nhas very compulsive relationships with food textures, but that could also be<br/>\nSensory stuff, etc.  Labels don&#39;t always help except to lead you to new<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have found that giving Douglass the skills to master his own physical<br/>\nneeds helped so much and he has become so calm and accepting of himself that<br/>\nnone<br/>\nof us think if him as having any disorders at all.
