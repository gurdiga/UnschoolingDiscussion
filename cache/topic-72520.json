I&#39;m certainly not advocating sitting a kid <br/>\n<br/>\ndown and making him do it...been there done that hated it...but I&#39;m <br/>\n<br/>\nthinking, an ability to grasp the concepts depends upon the knowledge <br/>\n<br/>\nof the numbers. Not the numbers on paper NECESSARILY, but the numbers.**<br/>\nAND<br/>\n**Yea..... Don&#39;t you need to know **how** to do the math with a calculator so <br/>\nyou can push  the right buttons? Memorizing numbers is not the same as <br/>\n***how*** to do it.  <br/>\nLara.........  who still does NOT know her times-tables (and loves her <br/>\ncalculator), but knows **what** multiplication is!! (Hey!!! I went to pub <br/>\nschool for <br/>\n12 years and graduated  with high honors, AND had a dad who stood over me a <br/>\nhit me on the head when I said the wrong answer to the times-table flash <br/>\ncards <br/>\nhe was holding; shouldn&#39;t I know all of them then? hehehe)**<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least one of my children learned an incredible amount about arithmetic and <br/>\nthe symbols used for the operations by playing around with a calculator. She <br/>\nasked for a calculator of her own when she was five or thereabouts, so I gave <br/>\nher one. She would sit and mess around with it for long stretches of time, <br/>\nover a period of many months. Eventually she started showing me stuff. One of the <br/>\nthings she had discovered was the concept of multiplication. She showed me <br/>\nhow if she pushed the * button in between two numbers, she got the same result <br/>\nas if she had added the first number to itself as many times as her second <br/>\nnumber. (I wish I had written down the words she used to explain this to me, <br/>\nthey&#39;ve flown the coop I&#39;m afraid). She had discovered patterns from repeated <br/>\nadding of numbers. (for instance, that multiples of 5 always end in 5 or 0.) She <br/>\nhad figured out division. She had discovered negative numbers. She had <br/>\nrecognized relationships between odd and even numbers, and discovered the power of zero.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71697,"nextTopicId":72323}}
