I would suggest going the <br/>\nroute of seeing a licensed clinical social worker.  We had very good luck <br/>\ndoing this. Our social worker saw our son several times and it was he (our son) <br/>\nwho finally thought medication might be warranted. The social worker referred <br/>\nus to an adolescent psychiatrist who eventually did prescribe an <br/>\nanti-depressant. But the psychiatrist kept close tabs, didn&#39;t push the medication and <br/>\nconsulted regularly with the social worker. The medication, combined with the <br/>\ntherapy with the social worker, worked wonders. If you want more specifics or have <br/>\nother questions, email me offlist. I&#39;d be happy to provide whatever information <br/>\nI can.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81728,"nextTopicId":81737}}
