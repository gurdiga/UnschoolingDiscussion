I picked up a book at the library the other day, looked at it and <br/>\nput it back,too schoolish for me.. . . Just wondering how it has <br/>\ntranspired for those of you who have young readers or want to be <br/>\nreaders.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was reading within a few weeks of his third birthday.  We took <br/>\na very unschool approach to the whole thing (like most things).  He <br/>\nshowed interest, we made sure he had access to info.  He absorbed it <br/>\nand asked for more, we made sure he had more access.  We read to him <br/>\nand he had a phonics toy that named the letter or uttered the sound <br/>\nit most commonly represents when you pushed a button shaped like it. <br/>\nHe played a LOT with magnetic letters, alphabet flash cards, and a <br/>\nplacemat that had the alphabet on one side and a &quot;hidden letters&quot; <br/>\npuzzle on the other.  When he started absorbing sight words we got <br/>\nflash cards with them, too.  But the real breakthroughs mainly came <br/>\nfrom two sources--computer games and television--which allowed him to <br/>\nstudy reading on his own.  Of course, he&#39;s very visual and a very <br/>\nindependent learner (having me &quot;watching&quot; while he&#39;s trying to figure <br/>\nsomething out drives him bonkers), so that was in perfect keeping <br/>\nwith his needs.  That might not be true for your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe like Reader Rabbit around here--both the age-based series and the <br/>\nsubject-based line are popular, but the former is much more so.  (The <br/>\npublisher&#39;s website is at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learningco.com/SubCategory.asp?CID=251\">http://www.learningco.com/SubCategory.asp?CID=251</a> but you can buy RR <br/>\nstuff from almost any software vendor.)  We also downloaded several <br/>\nthings (shareware and freeware) from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kidsdomain.com/down/index.html\">http://www.kidsdomain.com/down/index.html</a> and linked from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kidsdomain.com/games/index.html\">http://www.kidsdomain.com/games/index.html</a> to online games that he <br/>\nenjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re open to using TV, I recommend you check out Between the <br/>\nLions, on PBS.  That show is probably the largest single contributing <br/>\nfactor in my son making the transition from &quot;knows certain words&quot; to <br/>\n&quot;really reads&quot;.  The website at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbskids.org/lions\">http://www.pbskids.org/lions</a> is <br/>\ndesigned as a complement to the show, and you can find out almost <br/>\nanything you want to know about it there.  There are descriptions for <br/>\neach episode, including what letter sounds and combinations are its <br/>\nfocus, and online and printable games and a list of recommended books <br/>\nto reinforce the information.  The site also has a section for <br/>\nparents and teachers which explains in detail the educational theory <br/>\nbehind the show and gives tips on teaching reading.   If I were going <br/>\nto &quot;do&quot; anything to &quot;teach&quot; him to read, I&#39;d probably start there. <br/>\nIt&#39;s such a FUN show, lots of music, groovy laid-back lion family <br/>\nthat seems to be unschooling. . .though the show&#39;s producers may not <br/>\nrealize it.  You can also link from the PBS site to info on your <br/>\nlocal station and air times for the show.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you can find a fun way to feed that need!<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty Blagg<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athterath@...\">athterath@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"jefferson academy","from":"jefferson academy &lt;jeffersonacademy@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"qXOls4n2GcmVTN2-wfIc4IBJzljzkNudiWtjj_ajY3mwcGkpNObGKZCJOPy99BzIBitavF9CA1A-f8D8hwDYLlIRx2eRfEn4LM9XBZGgbUyIkJJGFw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: speaking of reading","postDate":"997911629","msgId":23356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwODE1MjE0MDI5LjgxMzc3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0ODAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDljLjEyNDNhMWU1LjI4YWMxMjAxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":23352,"nextInTopic":23512,"prevInTime":23355,"nextInTime":23357,"topicId":23349,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The words on all the<br/>\nobjects in your house is a good idea.  A word wall is<br/>\nanother - a wall with pictures of objects with the<br/>\nname of the object on the card.  Some children learn<br/>\nby writing to read. Since she can print you could help<br/>\nher to write her own stories by spelling them for her.<br/>\n Some children are more sight readers and would be<br/>\nhelped by having the same few books read over and<br/>\nover. She&#39;ll soon &#39;read&#39; it from memory.  Some kids<br/>\nlike to play a game with flash cards where you show<br/>\nthem a letter and if they can think of a word that<br/>\nstarts with that sound they win the card.  You can<br/>\nplay a game of saying words like &#39;lighthouse&#39; and see<br/>\nif she can break it into light and house (this helps<br/>\nwith auditory segmentation.) You can play a sound game<br/>\nby saying &quot;/c/ /a/ /t/ - what word is that?&quot; to help<br/>\nwith auditory blending (both necessary skills for<br/>\nreading development.
