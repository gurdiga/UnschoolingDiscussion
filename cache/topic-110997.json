Her little sister  <br/>\nWAS always really good at games - she concentrates, she has an  <br/>\nability to understand probabilities, she thinks strategically AND  <br/>\nshe&#39;s very visual so a lot of children&#39;s games, that tend to rely on  <br/>\nvisual memory, were easier for her. The game, SET, for example, was  <br/>\namazingly easy for Rosie when she was very little -- she could sit  <br/>\nthere and pick out sets as fast as the dealer could put the cards  <br/>\ndown, while the rest of us would have to stare at the cards for a  <br/>\nwhile and MAYBE find a set. This was the most extremely problematic  <br/>\ngame, but also strategy games, like Penne and Mastermind and Othello,  <br/>\nwere Rosie&#39;s cup of tea, while Roxana didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; them quite as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out as they got a little older, Roxana got so good at word  <br/>\ngames that her sisters didn&#39;t want to play those with HER - it isn&#39;t  <br/>\na matter of not winning, it is a matter of her playing so much better  <br/>\nthat they don&#39;t even get many turns.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then she was on the other side of the issue - wanting to play  <br/>\ngames and others not wanting to play with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy then, I&#39;d gotten good at making up new rules for games - so that  <br/>\nit was still fun, but not as competitive - sometimes it worked if I  <br/>\nintroduced MORE luck to make it more even. For example, there are  <br/>\ngames where a player gets to continue as long as they are succeeding.  <br/>\nWe&#39;d decide, instead, that if they succeeded, the could roll a die  <br/>\nand if it came up even, they could play again, otherwise the could  <br/>\npick another player to get an extra turn. There were games where  <br/>\neveryone played at once - like SET - but we&#39;d play it taking turns,  <br/>\ninstead. There were games that we changed the entire GOAL of the game  <br/>\n- made the goal one that the players would have to cooperative  <br/>\ntogether in order to achieve. For example, you can play chess  <br/>\ncooperatively by making up some interesting rules such as - the goal  <br/>\nis to checkmate BOTH kings - and if a piece crosses a line across the  <br/>\ncenter of the board, the other player takes control of that piece. So  <br/>\nplayers start out controlling all white or all black pieces because  <br/>\nyou line them up as usual on each side of the board, but if a piece  <br/>\ncrosses over the center and lands on the other side, the other player  <br/>\ntakes over control of that piece. What happens is that the players  <br/>\nhave to figure out WITHOUT discussing it, what the other player is  <br/>\nthinking of doing - and try to help with that so that both kings can  <br/>\nend up checkmated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility is just to &quot;handicap&quot; the adults or other people  <br/>\nwho are clearly better at the game - and with a young kid who really  <br/>\nHATES to lose - handicap them enough so that the kid always wins. For  <br/>\nexample, just make a rule - &quot;Kids get triple points of adults&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;Kids always get two turns, adults only get one.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the child is ready to take the chance of losing, he&#39;ll point out  <br/>\nthe unfairness of such rules, himself, and say, &quot;Let&#39;s play with  <br/>\neverybody getting the same points, okay?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo games --- Rosie played sports video games with her dad - she  <br/>\nwas never one to have a problem with losing (she also plays a lot of  <br/>\nsoccer and doesn&#39;t get devastated by her real-life teams losing,  <br/>\neither, completely gets it that it is part of the game and that if  <br/>\nthe possibility of losing wasn&#39;t there, the game wouldn&#39;t be fun).  <br/>\nRoxana plays &quot;The Sims&quot; a LOT on her computer. Oh - and she was one  <br/>\nof the first few hundred people to get involved on the NeoPets site  <br/>\nwhen it was brand-new - and she never seemed to have any problem with  <br/>\n&quot;losing&quot; there. In fact, Rox seemed mostly to be okay with any games  <br/>\nin which there is role playing involved. So maybe if a child is  <br/>\nhaving problems with losing videogames, it might be good to get them  <br/>\nsome games that are more role-playing oriented than &quot;beat this level&quot;  <br/>\noriented? There are games where &quot;losing&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you have to  <br/>\nstart ALL the way over -- with Zoombinis, for example, if you don&#39;t  <br/>\nmake it past a certain part, you don&#39;t go back to the beginning, you  <br/>\ngo back a little ways and get to keep trying until you DO make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - just somewhat random thoughts on games and losing.

Sometimes, mid-game, <br/>\nif he&#39;s losing and getting upset, we just stop the game right there <br/>\nand put it aside until he&#39;s cooled down and can play again. <br/>\nSometimes that means starting over again entirely several days <br/>\nlater. Sometimes it just means he goes and gets a drink of water and <br/>\ncomes right back. A biggie (aside from just general gradually <br/>\nincreasing maturity levels) is seeing us (me and DH) handle winning <br/>\nand losing and playing. There have been times when DS has said &quot;How <br/>\nabout you play Daddy?&quot; and DH and I will play whatever, winning, <br/>\nlosing, mainly having fun either way. One thing we did when we got <br/>\nan air hockey table and he kept losing (he&#39;d miss a shot or we&#39;d <br/>\nscore a goal and he&#39;d get frustrated and lose focus and miss more) <br/>\nis take a two pronged approach (a) remind him to take a breath to <br/>\nrefocus after every goal (whether he scored or his opponent) (b) <br/>\nwe&#39;d have practice sessions (instigated by him) where I&#39;d show or <br/>\nexplain how I do something - in the case of air hockey, we&#39;d <br/>\ndo &quot;defense practice&quot; where he&#39;d defend his goal with no thought of <br/>\nscoring and winning or we&#39;d do &quot;offense practice&quot; where he&#39;d fire <br/>\nshots at my goal and I wasn&#39;t trying to score. Gradually, he could <br/>\nsee the improvement in closer scores and even winning some of the <br/>\ngames. Then we could apply that to other things. Games of chance <br/>\n(things involving rolls of the dice and draws of the cards) are <br/>\nthings he likes because sometimes even the best strategy loses to a <br/>\nfortunate turn of a card. He&#39;s really good at Mexican train <br/>\ndominoes, for example, which often hinges on what you draw when. <br/>\nVideo games, he prefers the ones where he can team up with another <br/>\nplayer and work with them - James Bond games in multiplayer mode are <br/>\nsome favorites. The Lego Star Wars game actually allows for players <br/>\nto alternate who is the &#39;leader&#39; so that when DS reaches a spot that <br/>\nis difficult, DH can take the lead and show him how to get through <br/>\nit, then DS can take over again as lead. Right now DH and DS are <br/>\ngetting into &quot;Brick Wars&quot; - you build Lego buildings and use the <br/>\nmini figures and have battles - there&#39;s a whole rule book for it - <br/>\nhow far you can move each character on each turn, etc AND the <br/>\neffectiveness of a shot or strategy depends on a roll of the dice (6 <br/>\nand 8 sided dice are used). For example, whether a rifle shot hits <br/>\nwhat you target depends on whether you get a roll greater than 5 on <br/>\nan 8 sided die (5,6,7,8). DH lost this morning because he kept <br/>\ngetting 1s and 2s which are generally misses. So there&#39;s skill and <br/>\nstrategy (placement of players, where and when they move, etc) but <br/>\nthere&#39;s also an element of plain old luck in the roll of the dice. <br/>\nThat really helps because then DS can see how DH or I handle losing.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Learning to lose gracefully","postDate":"1136393161","msgId":110998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCMThCRTFDLTI4RjYtNDhDQi05RjFCLTU3NTEzQkQ3QzM3QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRwZ28xcitzdDMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRwZ28xcitzdDMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":110997,"nextInTopic":111001,"prevInTime":110997,"nextInTime":110999,"topicId":110997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ============================= Keith (the dad) doesn t like the how-to-host-a-murder type games, because if there s no winner, he sees no point in playing.
