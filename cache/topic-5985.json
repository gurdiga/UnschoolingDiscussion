I&#39;m wondering if his ideas would work for young children?<br/>\nI can&#39;t even remember his name.  I saw him on 20/20 a long time ago, and<br/>\nhe was quite amazing.  They showed him teaching kids his method, and it<br/>\nwas quite impressive.  Most of all the kids seemed like they were having<br/>\nalot of fun.  That&#39;s always important to me.  Especially As I suspect I<br/>\nhad a learning disability in math that was never discovered.  I&#39;m still<br/>\nreally slow with anything numbers, but I usually eventually get it.  :)<br/>\nA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5969,"nextTopicId":5968}}
