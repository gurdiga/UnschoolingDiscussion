A prose fiction longer than a short story but shorter than a  <br/>\nnovel. There is no standard definition of length, but since rules of  <br/>\nthumb are sometimes handy, we might say that the short story ends at  <br/>\nabout 20,000 words, while the novel begins at about 50,000. Thus, the  <br/>\nnovella is a fictional work of about 20,000 to 50,000 words. Examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nHenry James, Daisy Miller<br/>\nRobert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde<br/>\nHenry James, Turn of the Screw<br/>\nJoseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - 50,000 words could be considered a minimal length novel or a  <br/>\nreally long novella.<br/>\n(Make it 50,001 words, if that makes it feel more &#39;honest&#39; to call it  <br/>\na novel &lt;BEG&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is lots of stuff on the NaNoWriMo website to do to get yourself  <br/>\nall geared up for the November 1st start date, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie has just finished reading, &quot;No Plot, No Problem,&quot; a book about  <br/>\nNaNoWriMo.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe could not be MORE excited about writing her second novel!

There never seems to  <br/>\nbe enough hours in the day and yet when we don&#39;t do anything but the  <br/>\nessentials (like shopping for food and cooking) we found enough time  <br/>\nto devote to writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not a story teller.

The reason for not beginning  <br/>\nNaNoWriMo with an already begun *novel* is so can enter with a &quot;let&#39;s  <br/>\nsee where this goes&quot; attitude rather than having the characters  <br/>\nalready set and on a path. That won&#39;t apply to nonfiction, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who do try with a novel, you&#39;ll find that week 1 is pretty  <br/>\neasy because anything can happen and new characters can pop in  <br/>\nunexpectedly. It&#39;s sort of like releasing a herd of wild horses. Week  <br/>\n2 is harder because that&#39;s when things need to start making sense ;-)  <br/>\nSo it&#39;s like rounding them back up again. Then the 3rd week  <br/>\neverything is headed where it should go and week 4 is home free. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] National Novel Writing Month challenge","postDate":"1129403835","msgId":108977,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZS40NWNiMGY1Yy4zMDgyYWZiYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":108975,"nextInTopic":108978,"prevInTime":108976,"nextInTime":108978,"topicId":108971,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And a lot of fun :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter (13 then) and I both did it last year and got our 50,000  <br/>\nwords in. We&#39;ll be doing it again this year. I think 6000 people  <br/>\nmanaged to do it (out of lots and lots more who started and didn&#39;t  <br/>\nfinish of course!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegistration opens October 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n50,000 words is actually a novella. A novel generally has at least  <br/>\n100,000. But the point is to force yourself to push the words out and  <br/>\nlet them take you where the words and your characters want to go.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s no time for editing. There&#39;s no time for pre-editing --  <br/>\ncriticizing before the words even get written. There&#39;s only time for  <br/>\nwriting :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as I said amazing things come out. A lot of crap comes out  <br/>\ntoo ;-) But ideas will come out and you won&#39;t know where they came  <br/>\nfrom, ides like nothing you could ever have planned on.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can plan -- think up a basic story outline -- but no writing  <br/>\nuntil Nov 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI began with no plan [:)] I had three fantasy characters pop into my  <br/>\nhead: a dragon rider and a tiger rider and a monk (like a Buddhist  <br/>\nmonk with fighting skills) who was probably romantically involved  <br/>\nwith one of them but they were both really mad at him for some  <br/>\nreason. I had no idea why [;)] It was going to have to do with flight  <br/>\nthat was a passion of the dragon rider and she was going to lose that  <br/>\nat one point. And there would be demons. And that&#39;s it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe set ourselves a goal of 1700 words a day which is 51,000 words.  <br/>\nThat gives next to no leeway for days when writing doesn&#39;t go well or  <br/>\nwhen something comes up (like Thanksgiving!) But it&#39;s also mega- <br/>\nincentive to get back on track the next day. I don&#39;t think I went  <br/>\nmore than 2 days without catching up so it&#39;s a good kick in the butt.  <br/>\nI think I&#39;ll try 2000 words/day and see how that works this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering that the novel I&#39;ve been picking at for the last 20 years  <br/>\nhasn&#39;t gotten beyond (it&#39;s embarrassing to say ;-) 100,000 words of  <br/>\nnotes, actually finishing something and seeing the ideas flow without  <br/>\nbeing planned was enlightening to say the least :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re done you upload it to their automated word counter to  <br/>\nverify that you&#39;ve produced 50,000 words. There&#39;s no one judging  <br/>\nquality or checking to see if you&#39;ve uploaded 50,000 of the same  <br/>\nword ;-) It&#39;s a personal challenge and all you get is a link to a  <br/>\ncertificate you print out and personal satisfaction -- and a novel of  <br/>\ncourse! -- so there&#39;s nothing to be gained by cheating. You don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to have finished your story. You just need to have produced  <br/>\n50,000 words before midnight November 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s about it.
