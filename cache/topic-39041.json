We expect a thing to be a <br/>\nTHING.  And a verb to be ACTION!  Wham! Pow!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe action of &quot;teaching&quot; isn&#39;t simple and clear.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there are pairs of words like &quot;pitcher and cup&quot; or &quot;pitcher and catcher&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;ball and socket&quot; we assume the two things are complementary parts of a <br/>\nwhole.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have (and have had for many languages back up the line, I&#39;m guessing, <br/>\nmaybe) &quot;teacher and student.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;m thinking about it, though, maybe this is, in part, an English <br/>\nlanguage problem.  Because in Romance languages (Latin-based, Italian, <br/>\nFrench, Spanish...) they use &quot;maestro&quot; or forms thereof.  &quot;Master&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;Mistress&quot; of an art or body of knowledge.  Someone can be a maestro with no <br/>\nfollowers or students.  One can&#39;t very well be a teacher without the presence <br/>\nof a student.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, we do have in modern English the pair &quot;teach and learn.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to teach someone how to use quotation marks, I can talk, show them, <br/>\nmake jokes, draw stick figures with speech-balloons, and I could maybe sing <br/>\nsongs about it.  So IF the person who&#39;s in the room &quot;being taught&quot; is <br/>\nthinking about how to file down that one piece of a machine gun that can turn <br/>\na legal semi-automatic into an illegal automatic, and how to hide that part <br/>\nreally well, disguised as something altogether different, what am I doing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m talking, writing, drawing, dancing and singing.  But I&#39;m not teaching.  <br/>\nI&#39;m reviewing for myself something I already know.  I&#39;m just performing a <br/>\nplay of sorts, without an audience.  I&#39;m playing with myself.  I&#39;m...  Well, <br/>\nyou know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I&#39;m reading a magazine about machine guns and someone comes and says <br/>\n&quot;How do I punctuate a quote within a quote?&quot;  I can show them.  If they don&#39;t <br/>\ntotally understand, I can draw pictures or give other examples.  When I <br/>\nperceive that they have learned the thing they wanted to learn, I should s<br/>\nhush up and go back to my magazine, because the action is completed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey learned.  I helped them learn.  <br/>\nI was &quot;the teacher&quot; but I didn&#39;t do the work which resulted in learning.  The <br/>\nlearner did that in his head.  I wasn&#39;t in his head.  I could put ideas in <br/>\nthe air, but only he could hear and process and ask more questions.  Without <br/>\nhis active work, no teaching can possibly take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So if teaching *really* means competently and compassionately facilitating <br/>\nlearning, then <br/>\nteaching *does* exist, no? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s that Buddhist talk about being the water, being the ocean.  Think of <br/>\nit as kneading bread, maybe.  Here&#39;s a truth:  teaching has no action to show <br/>\nfor itself which is &quot;teaching.&quot;  You can&#39;t really pour useful information <br/>\ninto anyone else&#39;s ears or eyes against their will.  They can learn like <br/>\ncrazy, but you can&#39;t make them learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nFold and push.  People learn from other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nFold and push.  There are people paid to teach.  Some are aware that there <br/>\nare limitations to what they can do.  Others are not philosophical and <br/>\nbelieve that if they &quot;taught&quot; (presented information) only the lazy and <br/>\nuncooperative could possibly fail to &quot;learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFold and lean and push really hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Teaching&quot; is an idea which most people understand on a quick, simple level.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s an idea that the best teachers and the best homeschoolers (i.e. we <br/>\nunschoolers) think about more carefully and examine more closely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that I&#39;ve taught my kids to be kind and patient.  If they reject that <br/>\n&quot;teaching&quot; though, they&#39;re not taught at all.  I would have modelled and <br/>\ndiscussed and totally failed miserably to teach.  But somehow I persuaded <br/>\nthem to believe that what I believed was important.  Sometimes, somehow, I <br/>\npersuade people to believe unschooling will work and is important.  Some <br/>\npeople fail to learn it but I keep singing and dancing anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t much like jazz, but philosophy, ideas and teaching are kind of like <br/>\njazz.  Early in playing an instrument you&#39;re told the One Right Way to hold <br/>\nit, to blow/strike/pluck, to use the keys so you don&#39;t damage them, to stand <br/>\nor sit just so,  making it easier for you and safer for the instrument.  <br/>\nThose are The Rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get so good at your instrument that you can play it in the dark, <br/>\nquickly, while carrying on a conversation with someone else at the same time <br/>\n(not wind instrument players, but you know what I mean...) then the rules no <br/>\nlonger apply to you.   At that point you cannot be a beginner who accidently <br/>\nbroke an instrument out of ignorance or carelessness.  You will love that <br/>\ninstrument and know it really well, and maybe be able to repair it.  At first <br/>\nthe instrument was the sacred goal, but once your musicianship is greater <br/>\nthan the instrument, you are beyond and above the simple rules.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a rule:  You have to stand to sing.  Otherwise your diaphragm is <br/>\ncramped up and you won&#39;t be able to support your notes and control your <br/>\npitches.  HAVE to stand up.<br/>\n<br/>\nProfessionals in musicals and operas--they can sing sitting, they sing lying <br/>\nin beds, they sing while they&#39;re dancing, they sing in all kinds of <br/>\npositions.  Folksingers and traditional musicians of various kinds sing <br/>\nsitting in various situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can teach like they can sing.  So why am I saying teaching doesn&#39;t exist?  <br/>\nBeginners need to stand up to sing.  Beginning teachers need to know that <br/>\nteaching isn&#39;t a thing you do to someone else.  Rather, learning is something <br/>\nthat you MIGHT, if you&#39;re lucky, get to assist with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn beginning stages, like student teachers and beginning homeschooling <br/>\nparents and assistant karate teachers (which my son is) and games teachers <br/>\n(Marty and Holly have both &quot;taught a game&quot; in the past couple of days, or <br/>\nrather recited rules in the presence of other people) need to look for and <br/>\nsee learning as a separate process from their own song and dance. In advanced <br/>\nstages there is teaching, but it is compassionately and competently <br/>\nfacilitating another&#39;s learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;ve just written my next HEM column.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39111,"nextTopicId":39118}}
