I am ashamed to <br/>\nsay that I went through a period of extreme TV snobbishness.  I felt that <br/>\nwatching television was a waste of our time, so I got rid of cable.  We only <br/>\nwatched carefully chosen videos, designed to enrich and uplift us.  (I cringe <br/>\nas I write this now!)  I was totally obnoxious about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n   One day Colton and Bud returned from the library, thrilled with what they <br/>\nhad found.  A video copy of &quot;Godzilla!&quot;  I snorted derisively and suggested <br/>\nthat our time would be better spent with a book.  I was ignored.  They made <br/>\nsome popcorn and started the movie.  I sat with them on the couch, or to be <br/>\nmore accurate, on my moral high horse, with an &quot;uplifting&quot; book in hand.  I <br/>\nrolled my eyes and sighed with gusto to point out how they were wasting their <br/>\ntime.  Colton and Bud continued to ignore me.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Something finally penetrated my self-imposed role as the chief of the <br/>\nculture police.  A voice whispered in my ear: Look at them, Carol.  Just LOOK <br/>\nat them!  I studied my son and my husband for about five minutes.  They were <br/>\ntotally engrossed in the movie, yet they never stopped touching each other.  <br/>\nColton would lean against Bud&#39;s shoulder as he giggled helplessly, or Bud <br/>\nwould squeeze Colton&#39;s leg during a particularly intense moment.  They were <br/>\ntotally connected to each other through their movie experience, and it was a <br/>\njoy to watch.  I knew that they were making a memory together.<br/>\n<br/>\n   We had cable reinstalled the next day, and we never looked back.  We don&#39;t <br/>\nwatch a lot of TV, but when we do, we do it together.

He is also fully emersed by the sound of the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n I did see Jane Healy speak and she does have examples of the harm TV may cause. She also talked about the classroom and how the brain grows. She said the growing brain is the one asking questions. So in a classroom, the teacher is asking the most questions and keeps growing intellectually. My son asks a zillion questions while watching TV.  His brain is growing. He is learning. I still want to turn it off all the time, yet now I have learned to respect what the kids are doing. Am I interrupting something important or can we finish the movie later? My hubby and I do not want TV much. News maybe once in a while and that is all. We took the kids to the snow on Superbowl Sunday. A great way to avoid crowds. I think we are modeling the self- control we hope for. For now, when we are home, the kids can watch TV if they want. they watch a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did get overwhelmed recently with the hours they were watching. We have been on a Starwars role for weeks. I told the kids before bedtime that I needed a different day and I needed to be able to listen to music and dance and play with them so I was scheduling a TV free day. They completely respected it, woke up the next day, brought games out to play with me. Had they really had a problem with my idea, I would have listened and compromised. I&#39;m happier not policing their TV. They are happier to be able to do what they like. If they are being ruined, they are safely home with a listening ear watching Between the Lions learning how to sound out words. And I was able to write for the first time in weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123374705,"authorName":"ejcrewe@aol.com","from":"ejcrewe@...","profile":"ejcrewe2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV","postDate":"1044474947","msgId":57978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Ny4xNTI5ZjI4YS4yYjcyYzY0M0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51169,"nextInTopic":57982,"prevInTime":57977,"nextInTime":57979,"topicId":19831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We have a VCR and my daughter can watch movies any time she wants, too. When we travel she gets to watch TV shows at the hotel, and this just seems to be part of the &quot;special&quot; things we do when we travel. Unless, of course, there&#39;s something more interesting than TV...<br/>\nPlus, she can rent any of those shows any time at the video store anyway, so we can save the commercials.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not anti-TV or anything like that, but it&#39;s pretty sad to see what TV has become.

Our kids have a lot of access to Game Boy and Nintendo, but we do not<br/>\n&gt; have TV at all.  When we first moved to Georgia, we had TV, cable and all.<br/>\n&gt; We found that there was so much garbage on cable that it wasn&#39;t worth<br/>\n&gt; keeping, so we got rid of it.  Then about a month later our antennae broke,<br/>\n&gt; and we ended up with no channels.  No one seemed to miss it, so we just never<br/>\n&gt; replaced the antennae.  We have a VCR and a DVD player and the kids can watch<br/>\n&gt; movies whenever they want.  We have a real issue with all the negative and<br/>\n&gt; blatantly sexually explicit media images out there - it&#39;s scary that they<br/>\n&gt; even use sex to sell children&#39;s products (I saw a very suggestive commercial<br/>\n&gt; for &quot;Fruit by the Foot&quot;).  We feel that those subtle innuendoes are<br/>\n&gt; unnecessary and damaging.  At our friends&#39; houses, the kids can take TV or<br/>\n&gt; leave it.  They aren&#39;t really &quot;into&quot; the latest trends, bands, fashions,<br/>\n&gt; etc., and we like it that way!  Pokemon was the big thing when our TV died,<br/>\n&gt; so they sort of stalled there :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I guess I just wanted to say that removing TV is not always a bad<br/>\n&gt; thing.  I do agree that by restricting or denying access to something you are<br/>\n&gt; inviting an obsession, but it just doesn&#39;t seem to have happened in our case.<br/>\n&gt;  Maybe it&#39;s because the stuff they enjoyed watching on TV (nature<br/>\n&gt; documentaries, for the most part, and Pokemon) are all available on video, so<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t feel like they are missing anything.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Steph<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TV","postDate":"1018634940","msgId":34566,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5LjIwODQ3NTYxLjI5ZTg3Y2JjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34563,"nextInTopic":51064,"prevInTime":34565,"nextInTime":34567,"topicId":19831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/12/02 11:15:10 AM Mountain Daylight Time, ...

The kids might binge for a <br/>\nweek or two, especially if from experience they figured the mom didn&#39;t REALLY <br/>\nmean it was freely available from now on, but that the offer would be <br/>\nwithdrawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the TV was just one of many things, since they were born, it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nspecial or magic or the focus of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was five he got a Nintendo.  He would play Mario for hours at a <br/>\ntime, sometimes.  I could see by his eyes that he was thinking up a storm.  <br/>\nWe got him the player&#39;s guide, and subscribed to Nintendo Power, before he <br/>\ncould read.  He learned to follow maps from that, and he learned deductive <br/>\nreasoning, because on the bonus screen on that first Mario game, there are <br/>\nonly eight different arrays, and they were shown in the player&#39;s guide.  I <br/>\nwould help him, at first, to make a good choice, eliminating some of the <br/>\narrangements with each guess.  They only allow two mistakes, or you don&#39;t get <br/>\nthe bonus.  Soon he could do it on his own, ALWAYS getting the bonus, and so <br/>\ngetting to more difficult levels of the game.  And he taught the neighbors <br/>\ndeduction and the process of elimination with that chart.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy keeping his issues all in order and ordering the index, when he was eight <br/>\nand had learned to read from those Nintendo resources, he learned to use an <br/>\nindex to look things up.  A couple of times, he gave a friend a Nintendo game <br/>\nfor a gift, and he would make a little folder with photocopies of all the <br/>\narticles about that game which had appeared in Nintendo Power, and the <br/>\n&quot;cheats&quot; which appeared after the game came out, because the index allowed <br/>\nhim to find all those references.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe index was set up  Issue#:page  (like 35:14).  Knowing that, he will <br/>\nimmediately understand how a Bible concordance works, and how references in <br/>\nShakespeare work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that was one trail his unlimited TV use followed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recorded Sesame Street a lot when he was young, and would move the best <br/>\nparts to a &quot;Best of&quot; tape.  We still have that tape, and it&#39;s six hours of <br/>\nsome of the best Sesame Street bits--art, animation, songs, guests.  Holly <br/>\nwas watching it just a month ago; it&#39;s ten years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty loved the movie Dumbo.  He watched it every single day for weeks.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to stay with him after he had it memorized.  And while he watched <br/>\nsometimes he just sat (he&#39;s our introvert) and sometimes he played with toys, <br/>\nor drew.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur TV then was in the room next to the kitchen.  We put a table in there so <br/>\nthe kids could eat in front of the TV (the house was tiny), and so I&#39;d do <br/>\nfood prep, or my own writing or whatever, at that table so I&#39;d be where the <br/>\nkids were.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Would <br/>\nyou spend your entire day in their world in front of the toob because they <br/>\nwere &quot;learning&quot; something and you wanted to be available to chat about the <br/>\nshows? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBy putting &quot;learning&quot; in quotation marks, do you mean to say you doubt that <br/>\nthey were learning?   By spelling it &quot;toob&quot; do you really intend for your <br/>\nbias to be obvious?  Some people write without a careful awareness of the <br/>\nunintentional messages, but some are clear on what they&#39;re communicating, and <br/>\nif that is true of you, then the question as worded above has a strong <br/>\nsarcasm to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My guy picks a movie over visiting with friends, a bike ride, most <br/>\nany other activity. He is passionate about it. I get unnerved, in a bad mood <br/>\nand plain grumpy when he has his TV or die mood. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he doesn&#39;t like his friends much, and is tired of riding his bike in <br/>\nthe same old places.  Maybe he wants to think about the world, and how people <br/>\ninteract, and how language can be art, and how cinematography and a good <br/>\nsoundtrack can be transporting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re in a bad mood because YOU don&#39;t like what he&#39;s doing, that might be <br/>\na matter for your self introspection.   If he is passionate about it and you <br/>\nprevent his access, will you kill his passion?  And while you&#39;re at it, is <br/>\nthere not a danger that his respect and hope will erode?   My faith in my own <br/>\nmother&#39;s good judgment eroded quickly as I saw her make selfish and arbitrary <br/>\ndecisions without regard for my own interests and desires and abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;By establishing clear <br/>\nlimits with him, allowing him to schedule when he will watch TV and what has <br/>\nreduced our friction over this issue.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like the friction is on your end, and he&#39;s having to give up a passion.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If I&#39;m interested in his choice, I&#39;ll <br/>\nwatch along. If it is Barney sings again, I&#39;ll do something else.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do something else and still sing along.  I learned every Barney song <br/>\nthere was to learn.  (By the time Pokemon came along, I didn&#39;t get involved <br/>\nin that, because I still had a younger kid and I let the two Pokemon-boys <br/>\nsupport each other in that interest.)  I could have told them Barney was <br/>\nstupid, and they were wasting their time, and to turn the damned thing off, <br/>\nbut my goal was their learning in happiness, so my priority and belief <br/>\nprevented insulting their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Disney Saturday morning does not <br/>\nthrill me, though. Should I fake it? Should I sit and watch instead of make <br/>\nsome yummy food from scratch? I loss interest when  I&#39;m watching Clifford <br/>\nagain for the 100th time.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have to TELL them it doesn&#39;t thrill you?<br/>\nCan&#39;t you make yummy food and bring them some where they&#39;re watching Clifford?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who will read the same book five times and listen to the same music <br/>\ntwo hundred times sometimes say they will not watch a movie twice.   It stuns <br/>\nme that they&#39;re thinking in such a shallow way.  There is SO much more to see <br/>\nor to miss seeing in a movie than on a Beatles album or a Kurt Vonnegut book. <br/>\n No professor will teach a book he hasn&#39;t read repeatedly and also read <br/>\nbackground and commentary on.  A child doesn&#39;t really KNOW a movie, or a <br/>\nfairy tale, or a song, until after many hearings/viewings/singings.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I look at my son&#39;s glazed over expression and <br/>\nwonder, is this TV media unsafe for him. He looks kind of ill, totally zoned <br/>\nout, not really &quot;there&quot;. Looks like a stoned teenager. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you&#39;re jealous because he is Totally involved in something you&#39;re <br/>\nnot in on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You can not stand in <br/>\nthe way of the TV or he freaks out. His baby sister can not turn it off <br/>\nwithout an explosion from him. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you came and tore the page out of a book or magazine I was reading, I&#39;d be <br/>\npretty grumpy.  Or if you even closed the book, or turned the page.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were watching a movie that I couldn&#39;t rewind and someone insisted on <br/>\nmaking me pay attention to them instead, I would think the person was <br/>\nextremely rude.  I don&#39;t do that to people.  I&#39;d wait for a commercial if my <br/>\nhusband were watching West Wing and I wanted to ask him a question.  If he&#39;s <br/>\nreading a novel, I ask him if I can talk to him in a bit.  He finishes the <br/>\nparagraph or chapter, and comes and pays attention to me.   My kids are given <br/>\nand have learned to give the same courtesies to people inside the family and <br/>\nout. &quot;When you get a chance...&quot; is way better than &quot;TURN IT OFF NOW!&quot;  One <br/>\nbuilds respect and love, and the other erodes it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a sweet program on when I was little, on PBS, called The Friendly <br/>\nGiant.  Thanks to the internet, I looked it up one day, to show Holly <br/>\npictures, I hoped.  I learned that the host (a musician and puppeteer) had <br/>\nrecently died.  He was Canadian, and it was a CBC show.  Reading about his <br/>\nlife and his beliefs about learning was wonderful.   My mom used to come in <br/>\nand say &quot;Turn that boring show off.&quot;  She had never even watched it.

When your kids were <br/>\n5 years old and if they wanted to sit and watch all the shows on TV back to <br/>\nback without ever getting up day in and day out, would you let them? Would <br/>\nyou spend your entire day in their world in front of the toob because they <br/>\nwere &quot;learning&quot; something and you wanted to be available to chat about the <br/>\nshows? My guy picks a movie over visiting with friends, a bike ride, most <br/>\nany other activity. He is passionate about it. I get unnerved, in a bad mood <br/>\nand plain grumpy when he has his TV or die mood. By establishing clear <br/>\nlimits with him, allowing him to schedule when he will watch TV and what has <br/>\nreduced our friction over this issue. He gets to watch and I know when it <br/>\nwill be and can plan my activities. If I&#39;m interested in his choice, I&#39;ll <br/>\nwatch along. If it is Barney sings again, I&#39;ll do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree watching with the children is a great connecting experience. We <br/>\ndo this. We all get movies from the library and watch together. There are <br/>\nlots of neat things out their on video. Disney Saturday morning does not <br/>\nthrill me, though. Should I fake it? Should I sit and watch instead of make <br/>\nsome yummy food from scratch? I loss interest when  I&#39;m watching Clifford <br/>\nagain for the 100th time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find all things can be learning experiences, yet some things can become <br/>\ndangerous/unsafe. Blocks are great fun, but thrown at a sibling can not <br/>\nhappen because it may hurt someone. This internet is fantastic, yet easy to <br/>\nspend too much time on. I look at my son&#39;s glazed over expression and <br/>\nwonder, is this TV media unsafe for him. He looks kind of ill, totally zoned <br/>\nout, not really &quot;there&quot;. Looks like a stoned teenager. You can not stand in <br/>\nthe way of the TV or he freaks out. His baby sister can not turn it off <br/>\nwithout an explosion from him. This state of his is extreme. My 2 girls can <br/>\nsit and watch no problem. You can ask them a question and they respond. You <br/>\ncan get them to go to the park before the movie finishes. They may or may <br/>\nnot finish the movie. Oh, I do trust he will be O.K., he is still so young, <br/>\nsimple clear limits seem to work for us now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\nSorry this got so long, I guess I am passionate about the TV too, in that I <br/>\ndo not care for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV","postDate":"1010699842","msgId":30956,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZi5hOTE0NGZjLjI5NmY2ODQyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19831,"nextInTopic":34563,"prevInTime":30955,"nextInTime":30957,"topicId":19831,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 01/10/2002 3:00:19 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
