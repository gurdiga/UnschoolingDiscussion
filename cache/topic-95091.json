When he was 3 he <br/>\nwatched Lion King A LOT!  Somedays he would watch it multiple times, <br/>\nsometimes we would have weeks were he watched it everyday.  I watched <br/>\nit with him as much as I could stand and we talked about it a lot.  <br/>\nI&#39;m still not sure of all the things he got out of it, but I do know <br/>\nit led to an interest in African animals.  So we did a study of <br/>\nAfrican animals, using books, videos, computer games, trips to the <br/>\nzoo etc.  It started out with him just being interested in animals in <br/>\nthe savanna like in the movie.  Then we read about rain forests in <br/>\none of our books and he got interested in that.  Which led to a study <br/>\nof all habitats and the animals that live there.  He knows more than <br/>\nmost adults about habitats, adaptations, animals etc.  This interest <br/>\nhas lasted over a year for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis other passion is robots.  He found that passion also through TV <br/>\nand a show called Battlebots.  We watched it all the time and have <br/>\nmany episodes on tape.  He has a few Battlebots books that he looks <br/>\nat everyday (and has for almost a year), he is learning to read from <br/>\nthese books.  We are now building our own battlebot (his idea, but <br/>\nI&#39;m doing most of the work LOL).  He is learning about design, <br/>\nconstruction, electronics, physics and who knows what else because of <br/>\nthis passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout TV, my son may have still discovered these passions but I <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine what our life would have been like without them.  Just <br/>\nsomething to think about before limiting TV, you may be limiting your <br/>\nchild from finding their passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristy O</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"About TV","postDate":"1086360751","msgId":95091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENFNzYwQjFFLUI2MzYtMTFEOC05QjdBLTAwMEE5NUYwRjU2QUBicmF2ZXdyaXRlci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":95114,"prevInTime":95090,"nextInTime":95092,"topicId":95091,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One last post about this.

I was struck my my dd&#39;s vocabulary in that <br/>\ncontext. She was witty, articulate, and often savvy to what the <br/>\ncounselor&#39;s were about, especially when compared to her peers. She <br/>\nrepeatedly cracked up all up.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow perhaps she might have been that way just from being read to.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut her love for sitcoms on Disney has been the primary source of her <br/>\neducation this year and I&#39;m amazed at the dividends I see in her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe totally &quot;gets&quot; plot, characterization, acting skill, writing and <br/>\nmore. She uses adult language and imitates what she hears on TV and <br/>\nuses her language in context.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not have known that this was possible a year ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do watch with her and my other kids quite a bit and now have my own <br/>\nfavorite shows that we share together: That&#39;s So Raven (the I Love Lucy <br/>\nof the Disney channel), Boy Meets World, Whose Line is it Anyway and <br/>\nthe usual round up of reality shows (Survivor, American Idol, The <br/>\nSwan...)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95096,"nextTopicId":95130}}
