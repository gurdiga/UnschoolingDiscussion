The Aware Parenting Institute, founded by Aletha Solter. She has also written several books, &quot;The Aware Baby&quot; and &quot;Helping Young Children Flourish&quot; ,both of which were fundamental for me. My own mother was 14 years old when I was born, and needless to say lacked in skills, information and support. So I wanted to do it differently, and Aletha&#39;s work helped me to work on my own hurts from being raised destructively, as well as understand why babies and children (and everyone!) behaves as they do. Also, working always on my own stuff consistantly has made a huge difference. Thank you.<br/>\nRobyn<br/>\nP.S.
