Your son is only 14 months right now, and I&#39;m assuming he is your first?  Perhaps your husband will get more into doing things and going places as your son gets older.  Is your husband interested sports, outdoor activities, household repairs, wood working?  All those things are fascinating to little kids.  My son absolutely loves to follow my husband around and talk about the tools he uses and tries to understand how things work.   Just throwing a ball around at the park can lead to meeting other kids and parents.  I just can&#39;t believe he won&#39;t find any interesting things to do with your son as he gets older.  A three or four year old is vastly different from a 14 month old.  As your son starts talking more and more won&#39;t he want to engage with him more?  It also might be good to meet some homeschoolers in your area so that you can start to build relationships now while your son is little.

I find that my kids really benefit from<br/>\nhaving days where we don&#39;t have to go anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that preschool is necessarily negative.  I did a co-op preschool for<br/>\nabout 1/2 a year and was happy with it (although at the time I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nabout unschooling and wasn&#39;t yet planning to even homeschool).<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for opening and closing activates, the children were allowed to do<br/>\nwhatever they wanted while there.  There were different areas (art, picture<br/>\nbooks, large motor, dress up, etc.) and the teacher stressed that a child<br/>\nshould be able to spend their time as they wished, even if they chose to do<br/>\nthe same thing week after week.  Two parents were required to stay as<br/>\nhelpers each time, but parents were always allowed to stay even when it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t their turn.  My dd always wanted me to stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, preschool is still &quot;school&quot;, as compared to other activities that a<br/>\nchild could do.  If you are attracted to unschooling, it might be easier in<br/>\nthe long run to stay out of school during the years when children aren&#39;t<br/>\nrequired to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only imagine that the SF area has dozens of places that offer<br/>\nregularly scheduled activities especially for preschool age children.  For<br/>\ninstance, our children&#39;s museum always offers special art activities for<br/>\npreschoolers on a certain day of the week.  Maybe you could do some research<br/>\nthen OFFER Dan a list of some that you think he and Rory might enjoy<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I don&#39;t think that a young child necessarily NEEDS to have those sorts<br/>\nof activities.

Why do you think unschooling is better?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I only know what I have read about the Sudbury schools. IF the school<br/>\nwould be the same as unschooling at it&#39;s best. The children chose what to do<br/>\nand when, it still to me wouldn&#39;t be the same as being home. A school still<br/>\nhas only so many resources available there. The children for the most part<br/>\nstay there and there is a time limit and schedule as to being there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt home, if we hit a snag with what to do, we can leave. If something<br/>\ninterests us that isn&#39;t at home, we can leave. If it&#39;s midnight and we want<br/>\nto do have fun with something, we can. So there&#39;s nothing to make us stay<br/>\nhere, nothing to keep us away and no time limit when to do it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, and this is a big one. Here, we have family. We have brothers and<br/>\nsisters and friends here or coming as much as we want. We enjoy each other a<br/>\nlot. When the children have the need to go elsewhere or be with other kids,<br/>\nwe do. When they don&#39;t, there is no one to tell us they have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that all children at a young age &quot;need&quot; to have<br/>\nsocialization as far as being around other kids. Sometimes it&#39;s confusing,<br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s frustrating and sometimes it&#39;s great. If it&#39;s not forced,<br/>\nthan I don&#39;t have to worry about the confusing, frustrating part. I get just<br/>\nthe great part. Because when it&#39;s not wanted or needed or enjoyed, we don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to do it. And I can tailor that to each child&#39;s needs. And so far, my<br/>\nchildren don&#39;t need or even want that every day. There may come a time when<br/>\nthey do. Tara does, but the younger 3 don&#39;t. So I wouldn&#39;t send them to be<br/>\nwith other kids 5 days a week when that&#39;s not what they want. At the same<br/>\ntime, they aren&#39;t in the house every single day either. Being out and about<br/>\nIS socializing without being stuck in a room with the same kids every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess plain and simple, I like the come and go as we please, and I like<br/>\nthe idea of each day being different depending on who needs or wants what.<br/>\nSchool just can&#39;t do that.

It&#39;s really hard to weigh what&#39;s more important - I think it is important that he get out and see new things and have fun with other kids (and preschool would be the path of least resistance for Dan - who is the one having to do it all, so I do have to take that into account) but I also want to avoid the &quot;Sit down in a ciricle, we&#39;re going to sing now&quot; when he&#39;s totally engrossed in blocks and HAS to go sit for basically no reason but &quot;because teacher<br/>\n said so.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI am hoping for a better understanding of unschooling - the living in the backwoods comment was more tongue-in-cheek.

I think the thing is that many of the kids come from public school, so everything about these schools seems freeing to them.  Coming from unschooling it seems limited though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case my daughter really wanted to go because her best homeschooling friend started to go there.  Her friend went because she is highly social, apparently needing to be with other kids daily and all day.  Her mom, who is a good friend of mine, always said it would be really hard to provide all the social time as a homeschooler.  She also had two little ones to deal with and thought that limited the park day times and outings.  In our family we like a lot of home time, alone time, so it never seemed a problem to us.  So, I guess it depends on your perspective.  Also, the girl mentioned above was so relieved to finally be going to school.  When her parents suggested this alternative to homeschooling she said, &quot;Thank you so much, now I can finally be like all the other kids&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the tuition is pretty outrageous too, especially considering no classes are involved.  However, even at those prices these schools always struggle.  Even after many years of going strong, just losing a significant number (like 5) of kids can put them in jeopardy.  Also, these schools really attract younger kids and when they get to a certain age (usually around 10 or so) parents there start to expect more and often put them in regular school so they can finally &quot;buckle down and do some work&quot;.  Hey, another thing I noticed that was interesting.  My daughter is a major reader and writer, but when she was in school she didn&#39;t do nearly as much of that as when she was home.  I think it actually limited the amount of time she spent learning about interesting things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the south bay there are park days on Mondays, in Sunnyvale.

Well, it needs to work for the family too! But it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; should work in terms of maximizing joy not in minimizing fears.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; People often say we should do what feels right. Go on gut instinct. But what<br/>\n&gt;&gt; feels right is often what minimizes our fears. That isn&#39;t so bad except that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; we&#39;re full of fears that seem to make sense but aren&#39;t based in reality or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are only valid when certain factors exist.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; For instance we may fear that they won&#39;t read or learn math. We may fear<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that they won&#39;t know enough. We may fear that they will have gaps and doors<br/>\n&gt;&gt; will be closed off to them. We may fear that without a solid foundation of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; education, they&#39;ll be useful only as Wal-Mart greeters.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Too often we parents end up compromising our children&#39;s happiness so they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; can ease our fears. If we fear they won&#39;t read we might make them read for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;just&quot; 10 minutes a day. It doesn&#39;t seem like much to ask of the child<br/>\n&gt;&gt; because the fear seems so huge.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; But since the fear is valid only in school, the potential consequences out<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of school -- that the child will come to dislike reading or they will feel<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bad about themselves because they can&#39;t do what &quot;everyone&quot; can -- become<br/>\n&gt;&gt; significant and something to be avoided.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; If someone seems unconcerned about what we fear, it seems more reasonable<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that they&#39;re just clueless or living in la-la land, than that our fears<br/>\n&gt;&gt; might not be real. They sure feel real! Unschooling means holding our fears<br/>\n&gt;&gt; up to examination. It means being uncomfortable while we work through our<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fears. It means looking at how other people deal with those fears.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Because the rewards for children of growing up in freedom and joy are well<br/>\n&gt;&gt; worth it :-)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=============<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But<br/>\n&gt; it¹s taking a while for me to really BELIEVE in it all, that it can work<br/>\n&gt; and he will flourish and learn and grow if allowed to do so on his own<br/>\n&gt; schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is totally and completely normal! :-) It doesn&#39;t make sense that kids<br/>\ncan learn math by living if you haven&#39;t ever seen a child do it. You can&#39;t<br/>\njust wipe away 20+ years of seeing and hearing that math is hard and the<br/>\nonly way to do it is by working through all the problems in the textbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all love our kids as much as you do yours. The only real difference is<br/>\nthat we&#39;ve *seen* unschooling work so we know those fears -- that we&#39;ve all<br/>\nhad too! -- are groundless.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it all seems like we&#39;re Wiley Coyote out suspended in air. You can<br/>\nsee there&#39;s a bottomless pit under us and the only reason we aren&#39;t<br/>\nplummetting downward is that we haven&#39;t noticed we&#39;re out in midair yet. As<br/>\nsoon as we notice, we&#39;ll drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut from our perspective, we&#39;ve realized the pit is an illusion. We&#39;re not<br/>\nfalling because we&#39;re on solid ground.

She spent a year at each school and enjoyed it for the most part.  I too thought that it would be nice to have the community, but for me that didn&#39;t really work out.  This may have been because both schools were about 1/2 hour away from home, so it was hard to get Chloe together with other kids after school etc.  I didn&#39;t like having a school schedule even though it&#39;s very flexible as far as time to drop off and pick up.  You&#39;ll still get the comments about &quot;what if it doesn&#39;t work&quot;.  People ask, &quot;what about homework?&quot;, and &quot;what, no classes are required?&quot;.  In the end I decided it was a lot of money to pay to do the same thing we had been doing at home prior to her going.  From her perspective, she loved it and would go again if it were convenient for our family.  We are planning to move to an area that doesn&#39;t have a Sudbury school so it won&#39;t be an issue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have two friends from the SS in CA who have just left the school and are going to homeschool.  Most of the SS&#39;s have a problem with maintaining their populations.  They usually are struggling for money.  In fact the one here on Maui did a lot of fundraising this school year.  I do have to say that if I absolutely had to send my daughter to school that&#39;s the only kind of school I would consider.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do you live?
