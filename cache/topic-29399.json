Some of us here like to have debates and listen to all sides of an issue... what a great way to learn and grow. Most seem to be able to do this and not feel they have to convert anyone or even beat a dead horse over some things. Others (it takes two to tango, so I&#39;m not singling one person here... there are more that keep this ball rolling) seem to be upset all the time about one thing or another. In fact, it nearly shut down the list (imo.. that was what I thought would happen) but luckily, it didn&#39;t. <br/>\nLovemary has a good point... ignoring these kinds of posts is the best response, although I know it&#39;s sometimes hard to do. But, if we don&#39;t get a grip here, there won&#39;t *be* much of a list what with a few people promoting other ones to jump over to... this one could die out. I, for one, won&#39;t let a few bickering bickersons run me off but I *will* ignore posts from particular posters whose style is defensive. They may not change subject lines, but the names will be there and that&#39;ll be enough to make me use the delete button. I&#39;m hoping others will do the same!<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: DB <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, December 05, 2001 2:51 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Perceptions from a newbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Okay, I&#39;m a relative newbie on this list so I should probably just shut up and quietly unsubscribe, but when I saw an email entitled &quot;perceptions,&quot; I figured I&#39;d share mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I subbed to this list, I thought I&#39;d learn about unschooling and be able to discuss it with others doing the same.

I can only answer for myself. I admit to jumping <br/>\ninto the fracass now and then, having my buttons pushed by something or the <br/>\nother. How I do want to show up in the world and on this list is someone who <br/>\ncan respect all choices. . . do I always do that? Probably not, but it is my <br/>\nintent. It would be nice if the fierce arguing and constant need to be right <br/>\nwould stop, but it doesn&#39;t appear to be slacking off any. My choice is to <br/>\nignore and not respond to those posters anymore. I can&#39;t tell anyone else <br/>\nwhat choice to make or how to post, only choose how I will or will not <br/>\nrespond. How it all ties in with unschooling for me is in the life I lead for <br/>\nmy children to see.
