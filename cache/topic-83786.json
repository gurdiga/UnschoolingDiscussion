Without even saying <br/>\na word they both started the scissors/paper/stone thing.  A younger couple <br/>\nwatching it commented. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd once at the state fair, same two kids, both wanted daddy to carry them <br/>\nand they chose that way.   I carried the other one.  My hip wasn&#39;t as good a <br/>\nvantage point as daddy&#39;s shoulders.  I got the loser. But they knew there would <br/>\nbe lots of other good situations for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom  used to buy all four kids the same gifts for Christmas.  Four of the <br/>\nsame things.  VERY boring and not a good use of funds, but to her it seemed <br/>\n&quot;fair.&quot;  She counted and measured and it didn&#39;t make things &quot;fair,&quot; because some <br/>\nkids needed more or different.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the time my kids were babies, I avoided that over-measured &quot;fair&quot;ness <br/>\nand so they all are calm about one kid getting something when the others don&#39;t, <br/>\nor one kid&#39;s Christmas being flashier than another&#39;s because they know for <br/>\nsure it won&#39;t be the same kid every year. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago Marty and Holly said Kirby &quot;always&quot; gets the biggest, best <br/>\nChristmas presents.    WHAT!?  I said.  Cannot be.  One year we got him a VCR.  <br/>\nHe already had one, so this way he could record all his shows AND ours, and he <br/>\ncould re-edit his collections of tapes.  He did that, for months, but when <br/>\nthe family one broke we took his away from him.  One year he got a desk chair <br/>\nbecause he had had one scrounged from a dumpster, and it was all worn out.   (He <br/>\nkept it.  What a ratty chair, but now he has two.)   One year he got a video <br/>\ngame and I had failed to get him the memory card or an adaptor it needed.  We <br/>\ndrove around and couldn&#39;t find any.  Very bad on my part and ever since I&#39;ve <br/>\ngotten other teens to advise me on any tricky purchases.    <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the idea that we would buy three chairs or three VCRs or whatever seems <br/>\ncrazy to me.  They&#39;re really good at sharing.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  Kirby&#39;s boom box gradually became public too. It&#39;s in my sewing room at <br/>\nthe moment.  But he bought himself an x-box and that plays CDs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year Marty&#39;s getting the biggest/best (a TV and a Trogdor t-shirt, and a <br/>\nfew other less &quot;ooooh&quot; things).  Holly will have the greatest quantity, but <br/>\nnothing so far has cost over $15 or so (the DVD of Chicago might&#39;ve been a bit <br/>\nmore).  Kirby, so far, season 2 of &quot;24&quot; (which he requested so it won&#39;t be a <br/>\nsurprise), a mouse pad, a t-shirt like one he wore out lately which he had from <br/>\nthe karate school of Bugs Bunny and Taz doing karate,  and a copy of Pirates <br/>\nof the Caribbean on DVD.  Not a bad set of loot, but nothing really flashy and <br/>\neverything but the t-shirt will end up being shared with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the others will begrudge Marty that TV.  Each of them has a <br/>\nsmall but good TV.  Marty has had a big, heavy, messed up one that only gets a <br/>\nfew channels and those with a big line across the screen. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s because none of them are needy are unhappy that they&#39;re fine <br/>\nwith not comparing numbers or prices or size, most of the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

We have 5 kids and they all want to do everything.  It<br/>\ncan be overwhelming.  We did something that sounds horribly rigid but we<br/>\ntend to use it flexibly and it worked well for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 7 of us and 7 days of the week.

It helped<br/>\nus move from the kids being overwhelming in their race  for &quot;their space&quot; in<br/>\nthe family.  The kids knew that &quot;their day&quot; was coming and it made life<br/>\neasier all around.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what is interesting is the kids sharing their days.  Example:  &quot;It&#39;s<br/>\nZach&#39;s day to pick the blessing.

Other than saying lamely&quot; You can&#39;t do that to each other, or thats not allowed or they come to me and tell on each other and act like I&#39;m supposed to do something about it.  The older two girls are pretty much ok, except that the 10 dd and 9 ds are driving us crazy.  She is teasing him as much as she wants and he is getting angry and yelling alot.  I am covering my ears, telling him he is hurting my ears (got that from Ren, thank you) but I feel a little helpless here. <br/>\n<br/>\n Dh took them in the backyard and had a bonfire for them but he came in and mentioned how much they were arguing and calling each other names, in other words He didn&#39;t enjoy himself... so maybe it would be along time before he did it again. <br/>\n<br/>\n Our playstation went out with big brother too, so we have the computer games still and I hope to get them some type of game for Christmas, just the fighting really. How can I stop them from fighting with each other, they could drive all the other kids out of the house too?  dd14 is ready to move out LOL, she said the kids are driving her crazy... I want to help her.  She thinks they need a spanking, but of course I don&#39;t want to do that.  Just need some suggestions please.

I put it away and haven&#39;t looked at it till last week. By the time I<br/>\nhad waded through 4 sections I was almost thinking my kids should be in<br/>\nschool where they would receive the best education possible. My head hurt<br/>\nfrom having to read each sentence twice and it seemed to me that it was<br/>\nwritten to be deliberately confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I have a visit/inspection on Monday from the district moderator<br/>\n(eek!!!!!) and have used as much terminology as I can from the book. I think<br/>\nmine is  better written cause at least you only have to read it once and it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cause headaches!!!!  &lt;g&gt; And if that sort of rubbish impresses them<br/>\nthen I figured it would be smart to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone gave the moderator a copy of the Unschooling Handbook a couple of<br/>\nmonths ago so I am hoping he has read it and can see the benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, trying to breathe.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
