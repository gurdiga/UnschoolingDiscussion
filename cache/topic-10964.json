And you can still *do* the classical material, but in ways that<br/>\nmore fit your family.  And remember not every child has to be doing the same<br/>\nkind of thing.

There isn&#39;t anything<br/>\nin the middle school years that isn&#39;t presented again. Life science is just<br/>\ncut down biology.

So my family expanded from 5 to 7<br/>\novernight. I&#39;m still recovering. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m Patti - my husband and I have 5 children, ages 3 to 16,  at<br/>\nhome with us. I also have a son who is 26 and lives nearby. We&#39;ve been<br/>\nhomeschooling for about 12 years now. I&#39;ve been through a canned<br/>\ncurriculum, curriculum I compiled on my own, began doing Classical<br/>\nCurriculum after reading Laura Berquist&#39;s book a couple of years ago.  The<br/>\n3 older children (9, 13, 16) are enrolled in Westbridge Academy for gifted<br/>\nand accelerated homeschoolers. Their curriculum is geared to the individual<br/>\nstudent and is also classical. Currently, I&#39;m also writing the newsletter<br/>\nfor Westbridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in the Atlanta area - out near Stone Mountain - with our newly<br/>\nacquired wildlife..two guinea pigs. The girls are allergic to dog and cat<br/>\ndander so these are the first pet we&#39;ve had in eons. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I like the idea of classical curriculum (it looks great on paper)<br/>\nwe are having a hard time with the follow-through. I think we are more<br/>\nunschoolers at heart than I like to think and it is like beating your head<br/>\nagainst a brick wall sometimes. Dealing with structure is tough for us. I&#39;m<br/>\nalways looking for good ideas to get in the education we need but not beat<br/>\nourselves up because we burn out so easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter has been encouraged by Oglethorpe University to start<br/>\njoint enrollment this fall (she&#39;ll still be 16). They interviewed her after<br/>\nshe took her SAT sophomore year and got a 1270 (700 verbal, 570 math). They<br/>\nactually wrote her a letter saying that they &quot;personally&quot; were inviting her<br/>\nto come talk to them. Oglethorpe is very homeschool friendly and has given<br/>\ntop scholarships to homeschoolers the past few years. This is my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nfirst choice in colleges anyway so we&#39;re quite happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorking with the 13 year old is like pulling teeth sometimes. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nif it&#39;s the age, but it is tough to get her motivated to do her school<br/>\nwork. This is a constant struggle. She dances 6 to 7 days a week and it&#39;s<br/>\njust hard for her to make the transition from being in motion all the time<br/>\nto sitting still for classwork, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s it for now. I have to herd the kids to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to being part of this group. I think listening to<br/>\nunschoolers will help me a lot. I&#39;m very creative and I really think that&#39;s<br/>\nhalf the battle of my problems with a structured curriculum. <br/>\n<br/>\nPatti<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got lost in thought.  It was unfamiliar territory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wardfamily7@...\">Wardfamily7@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"bctswim@aol.com","from":"bctswim@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YBXRrmt5L6YCEXKJCr6WJOmueeoxxGxKkVHOf5h5B-cvDJS_ylo0oAa5GWA-YWl1e4EKjUnV","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 666","postDate":"963282932","msgId":10965,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2LjdlODUwYmUuMjY5YmUxZjRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10964,"nextInTopic":10967,"prevInTime":10964,"nextInTime":10966,"topicId":10964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 00-07-07 22:16:34 EDT, you write:  nanci, i hate to sound like a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1042346035\">In a message dated 00-07-07 22:16:34 EDT, you write:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Show off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today! &gt;&gt;<br/>\nnanci, i hate to sound like a dodo, but exactly what is a pagan?<br/>\nbridget</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"bctswim@aol.com","from":"bctswim@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"LwMyT2EpISaQxw5_mYe_oa5EwAnWHd8CyC1l3e9HP0mH8gg4EVDeCoe83CcrAvyQZ3-iE6Kw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 666","postDate":"963282629","msgId":10964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwLjZkZWUzYzEuMjY5YmUwYzVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10965,"prevInTime":10963,"nextInTime":10965,"topicId":10964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 00-07-07 22:16:34 EDT, you write:  sorry, stella, my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-547105414\">In a message dated 00-07-07 22:16:34 EDT, you write:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; hello -sorry - don&#39;t know your name( you didn&#39;t sign)<br/>\n how old are your children? &gt;&gt;<br/>\nsorry, stella, my name is bridget and i have 4 children-timothy, 13, <br/>\nchristian, 8, jeremiah, 5, and emmanuelle, 20 months. right now i am tackling <br/>\nthe messes in the house that make me ill to look at-like the eternal pile of <br/>\nlaundry on the couch-and the upstairs bathroom-yuck. i have to get a system <br/>\nand stick with it. have any of you ladies ever put their houses on a <br/>\nschedule? mon-laundry, tues-bathrooms, etc? i am wide open to suggestions. <br/>\nwhen we went to sesame place for 2 1/2 days, i told my dh i would rather move <br/>\nthan come bACK HOME TO THIS huge bomb. did i mention that my dishwasher died <br/>\n2 ays ago?<br/>\nbridget</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11024,"nextTopicId":11014}}
