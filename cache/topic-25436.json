I really do<br/>\n  love it, wouldn&#39;t live anywhere else (tried it and was so homesick) but you<br/>\n  do have to develop a thick skin and a strong sense of self.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We live just north of San Antonio in the southern Hill Country.  We have<br/>\n  family in Amarillo and are up there quite often.  Where are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25432,"nextTopicId":25441}}
