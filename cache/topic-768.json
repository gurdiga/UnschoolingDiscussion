We&#39;re not inclined to share <br/>\nit.  The lojong teachings encourage us, if we enjoy what we are experiencing, <br/>\nto think of other people and wish for them to feel that.  Share the wealth.  <br/>\nBe generous with your joy.  Give away what you most want.  Be generous with <br/>\nyour insights and delights.  Instead of fearing that they&#39;re going to slip <br/>\naway and holding on to them, share them.&quot;    --Pema Chodron, from _Start <br/>\nWhere You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living_<br/>\n<br/>\nI quoted that to go with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Gramma said when you come on something good, <br/>\n first thing to do is share it with whoever you can find; that way, the good <br/>\n spreads out where no telling it will go. Which is right. &gt;&gt;  and I&#39;m sorry <br/>\nmy first two attempts were prematurely launched.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":154,"nextTopicId":776}}
