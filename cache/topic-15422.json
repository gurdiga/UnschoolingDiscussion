I would prefer that my children be WITH me in church as part of <br/>\nthe complete gathering of people.  As for Bible instruction, I follow the <br/>\nexamples given there and we spend time reading scripture and then discussing <br/>\nit as a family.  Kids don&#39;t need a push in this direction, they are naturally <br/>\ncurious about everything, even God.  Be there with them to answer their <br/>\nquestions and show them how to read the Bible for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;     Also, several months ago I stumbled on to a kid&#39;s website that had<br/>\n math games with a Christian theme.  It used the numbers presented in<br/>\n different bible stories to create mathematical questions and problems to<br/>\n solve.  It was really amazing to see how prevalent mathematics was in<br/>\n the bible.  I had never thought about it in this way.  I thought I<br/>\n bookmarked it but I cant&#39; seem to locate it.
