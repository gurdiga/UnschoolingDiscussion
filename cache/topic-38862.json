I came up with a few <br/>\nthings. After putting in Breast feeding, History of bottle feeding, History <br/>\nof formula and History of Infant feeding, the last got me the most results. I <br/>\nfound that although breastfeeding is historically the most common way to feed <br/>\ninfants, that a wet nurse was second. The ancient Egyptians and kings and <br/>\nqueens of England and France used this practice. They would interview women <br/>\nlooking to see if there were any *craziness* in the family (that could be <br/>\npassed through the milk you know!) they would have the milk tasted and much <br/>\nmore. The wet nurses weren&#39;t always too concerned with their charges since <br/>\nthey had their own to look after as well, so there was a high infant <br/>\nmortality rate. One countess (16th century) who had 18 children, all of whom <br/>\nshe sent out to be nursed. Only one son lived, and when his wife nursed his <br/>\nown children and they all lived the countess wrote a pamphlet charging all <br/>\nwomen to breastfeed their own children and not send them out. Besides wet <br/>\nnursing, there have been instances of using an animal for a wet nurse. <br/>\nUsually when the mother died, and the father was left to raise the child on <br/>\nhis own. A popular &quot;formula&quot; (called pap) in 17th-18th century England and <br/>\nhere in the States was a gruel made of cows milk, crushed walnuts, and either <br/>\ncorn or oatmeal. This was put into a pap feeder that looked like a small boat <br/>\nwith a hollow spoon, the pap was scooped into the spoon and then blown into <br/>\nthe babies mouth. Bottles have been made out of wood, clay, pewter, other <br/>\nmetals, and glass. The wooden ones had cloth or something stuffed into them <br/>\nand the child would suck on that. The clay ones had a little spout that <br/>\nbabies sucked on. <br/>\nI was amazed at all the things I read. Although there isn&#39;t much on the <br/>\nsubject. What really shocked me was what women still do today!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] artificial feeding (kind gross, feel  free to skip it)","postDate":"1025631320","msgId":38885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDcwMjEwMzIzOC4wMjc3ZDBlMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PGRjLjE5NWM2NzQxLjJhNTJmZTVlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38878,"nextInTopic":38897,"prevInTime":38884,"nextInTime":38886,"topicId":38862,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
