Next pass through the area, I<br/>\nbring a hairbrush and desired &quot;trimmings&quot;.  Next pass, I&#39;ll bring<br/>\nshoes and socks.   The deal is not that I&#39;m doing nothing but<br/>\nwalking back and forth - I may answer an e-mail, take &quot;stuff&quot; to<br/>\nthe car, bank the fire, feed animals or whatever - but every few<br/>\nminutes in the course of those preparation for leaving steps, I&#39;m<br/>\nhelping her stay on track.  When she was 3-4, I really had to<br/>\nalmost hand over hand the process, now as often as not, she will<br/>\ngo from the first step to ready without any further prompts from<br/>\nme - I&#39;ll hear her head back to her room and the sounds of<br/>\npreparation.  But if she gets involved in watching a squirrel or<br/>\na book or whatever, the habit keeps us from devolving into a<br/>\nstruggle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is to allow enough time for some transitions,<br/>\nchanged minds and distractions.  It is a 30 minute drive to most<br/>\nevery where from here - an hour before I intend to leave, I<br/>\nassess what we need to do to get out the door, including the<br/>\nfood/clothing status (If there isn&#39;t a set arrival time, I may<br/>\nwait a little longer, since an error doesn&#39;t matter as much).  If<br/>\nwe are ready early, then the natural result is a more pleasant<br/>\ndrive and maybe time to make a favored stop or an unplanned one.<br/>\nBut because getting ready isn&#39;t wrapped up in unpleasant<br/>\nexperiences of &quot;Mama Exasperation&quot; there is little resistance to<br/>\ndoing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sognokids@...\">sognokids@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, February 14, 2003 4:17 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Getting out the door<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n|    I absolutely love the relaxed lives we lead as unschoolers.<br/>\nBut I have a<br/>\n| problem on days where we have to leave the house at an<br/>\nappointed time.
