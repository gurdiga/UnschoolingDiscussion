She can not debate you when","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-728489727\">Dear Molly, <br/>\nA debate will always have at least two sides.  My personal advise is this. Use &quot;I&quot; statements when speaking to her.  She can not debate you when you say, &quot; I feel my children will greatly benefit from...&quot; .  Will she try to say you do not feel that way? No. (at least I would hope not)  Next remember:  Never raise your voice when you should reinforce your argument.  That keeps a cool head and gives you the advantage. She will likely not see it coming...you have the advantage of role playing with your husband every conceivable thought she will have to change your mind...which has already been made up.  Be VERY clear of the laws and follow them to the letter.  Finally, if you feel the need to pull out the BIG guns and you feel really gutsie, encourage her to be supportive of your decision to catch the children up from being &quot;behind&quot; under her tutilage.  Above all do not forget she is your mom.  My mom didn&#39;t always agree with my decisions either(although she and Daddy were my backbone about the education of the girls-even before hubby), but now she is gone...and missed daily.  Try not to say things you believe will alter your longterm familial relationship.  I&#39;m sorry you are feeling these stressful concerns.  You never know, maybe it won&#39;t be as bad as you think.  : ) <br/>\nTeresa in Louisiana <br/>\nP.S.

At that time we were still<br/>\ndoing &#39;school at home&#39; and I tried to &#39;make&#39; her write. It didn&#39;t do much<br/>\ngood.(there&#39;s my regret, trying to force her to write) I finally left it<br/>\nalone. Now, at almost 15 she writes a lot. Sometimes out of need, sometimes<br/>\nfor pleasure. She would rather type than write but she&#39;ll do either. Her<br/>\npenmanship isn&#39;t great, but neither is mine or her Dad&#39;s so I&#39;m not worried<br/>\nabout it. My 12 yr old wrote much earlier, and much prettier. My 10 yr old<br/>\nwho is just now reading can write beautifully, knows the basic rules (spaces<br/>\nbetween words, periods, cap. letters) but only writes thank you notes and to<br/>\nlabel his intricate drawings of inventions and such, nothing else. His time<br/>\nwill come. As long as they have the tools, when the need or desire to write<br/>\ncomes, they will put it all together amazingly fast and be just fine.<br/>\nApril<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tamara Rousso [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tammy@...\">tammy@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 22, 2001 12:14 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] writing and unschoolin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to this list and subscribed because I am<br/>\ninterested in the opinions of other unschooling moms<br/>\nand how your children have learned writing skills. We<br/>\nunschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>\nwill know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>\nfollowing their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>\nhow they want to learn it. My daughter is nine this<br/>\nmonth and took off on reading about 6 months ago. She<br/>\nspends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>\nnon-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>\nher various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>\nwith her sibling and other children. She loves to<br/>\ndraw, but she HATESs to write. If she wants to leave<br/>\nherself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>\nfor the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>\nwill draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>\nthat where it reminds her. I have been fine with this<br/>\napproach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>\nin her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>\nfeelings she will feel compelled to write. I have<br/>\nkind of expected this will happen in adolescence.<br/>\nRecently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>\nquestion my judgement. Has anyone else out there left<br/>\nit up to divine providence that their children will<br/>\nindeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>\nwhen they are ready? Has anyone any regrets about<br/>\nnot being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>\nwriting? Thanks in advance for any input.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!

I<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt; the best resource (perhaps stating the obvious again, but it&#39;s not obvious<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; everyone here) is to read the library and archives at www.unschooling.com,<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; HEM&#39;s site, at NHEN&#39;s site.

Also, many times I will write<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\n&gt; privately and make the sale that way. They often have more than one of the<br/>\n&gt; same product and will sometimes sell for cheaper because I save them the<br/>\n&gt; hassle of putting the item up for bid (and the cost, albeit minimal).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if you know exactly what product you are looking for, check out the<br/>\n&gt; person&#39;s selling history, other items up for bid, rating, etc. This tells<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; a lot about what kind of seller the person is. And also keep in mind a<br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; ebayer will be as leery of you (first time buyer) as you are of them. They<br/>\n&gt; have a lot to lose too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never had a bad ebay experience. I did buy something once that wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; exactly what I expected (a toy - the picture made it look *much* larger<br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; it was but clearly stated the size) but I am still extremely happy with it<br/>\n&gt; and that was *my* error.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we bought our digital camera, we also negotiated (behind the scenes,<br/>\n&gt; after we won the auction) for extras at a lower price. A bag, an extra<br/>\n&gt; battery, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nicki<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2001 11:28:50 -0700<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:louisam1@...\">louisam1@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Just Curious<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&gt; discussing the idea of home schooling and this is our first inquiries<br/>\n&gt; to people who are doing the do.
