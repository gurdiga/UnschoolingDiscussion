Yes this<br/>\nwas the way I was raised. I do recall when paddling in the school was<br/>\n&quot;outlawed&quot;. As a child I felt releif (for the boys, rarely girls(girls<br/>\nwhere sent to the principals office to scare you) and also unfairness. I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand how a teacher could keep control of so many kids<br/>\nwithout it. Hummm interesting.<br/>\n        Now... well now others on this list can say it better than I. I<br/>\nfollow my heart. I have grown to respect the voices out there in cyber<br/>\nspace, Mags, and people in my area of the country. Thanks you all.:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E (Have I sent an intro?
