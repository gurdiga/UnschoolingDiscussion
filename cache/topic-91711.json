That way they knew that their special things would not get lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t take a box with you, it might help to let them pack at least one of their boxes so all their special stuff is in one place. We let the kids decorate their boxes with markers. It let them participate in the process and easily spot their special stuff as it came off the van. That worked well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you&#39;ve moved before, you probably know this, but make sure you have one box with cups, plates, utensils, etc. basic stuff that you can pull out right away and be able to pull a meal together. I had my basic spices, favorite pan, things like that. Take out only goes so far for so many days, you know? At some point you&#39;re probably going to want to scramble a quick egg or make a grilled cheese or something of the sort, and it&#39;s much easier to do from one box than to have to unpack several kitchen boxes to get the different things you need.  We had professional packers both times we moved cross-country, so I made sure to pack this box myself. They just wrote on it &quot;packed by owner&quot; so they wouldn&#39;t be liable for any breakage.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/danielleconger/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.geocities.com/danielleconger/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":71442105,"authorName":"Jill","from":"&quot;Jill&quot; &lt;jillmca@...&gt;","profile":"jillmca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"moving soon","postDate":"1078909868","msgId":91711,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1OTQwMWM0MDY3ZiRhMDIzYTNjMCQ2OTAxYThjMEB3a2tyYWxmbWNhcnRoeT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNzg4NzIzMTYuMzU5LjUwMzI5Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":91715,"prevInTime":91710,"nextInTime":91712,"topicId":91711,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have made books using the computer to walk the children through a move.
