He covers all the usual objections and shares how his<br/>\nfather (an attorney) didn&#39;t like homeschooling but strongly believed in<br/>\nparents&#39; right to do so.<br/>\nThe Teenage Liberation Handbook is great too.  Full of examples and<br/>\nresources of how to learn any &quot;subject&quot; in a real-life situation.  Also<br/>\nliked The Unschooling Handbook, hmm, now that I think of it I haven&#39;t<br/>\nseen that one in a while.  Who did I loan it to?.....<br/>\nMary Ellen (in Washington)<br/>\nSAVE EVERYTHING IMPORTANT ON FLOPPY DISK!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; From the annotation in the HOlt catelogue<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it sounded like the kind of gently persuasive book she would enjoy<br/>\nreading<br/>\nand find herself agreeing with in spite of herself. I&#39;m just so tired of<br/>\narguing with someone who is uninformed. I was surprised she agreed to<br/>\nread<br/>\nsomething about homeschooling b/c she is so absolutely certain that we<br/>\nare<br/>\nruining our children&#39;s lives and that schools are the one and only way.<br/>\nSo, Iguess I&#39;m putting a lot of stock in your book as the first book<br/>\nshe&#39;s<br/>\never read on the subject! If she&#39;s willing after reading your book, I&#39;ll<br/>\nsend her some of Holt&#39;s.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3265,"nextTopicId":3264}}
