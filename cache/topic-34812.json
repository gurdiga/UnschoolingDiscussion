Bridget already pointed out how this converstaion got started.<br/>\nYou were telling us what &quot;good&quot; unschoolers do.  Quite personally, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t say unschooling is the only way a child should be educated.  That<br/>\nis what works for my family.  I know many ecleteic homeschoolers, and their<br/>\nkids are happy, and are turning out fine!  Same with attachment parenting,<br/>\nit works wonders for some kids, and not for others.  Same as the TV, some<br/>\nfamilies love the thing, it just doesn&#39;t work for my family.  My family most<br/>\nlives, I don&#39;t go looking for all these enriching activities, I don&#39;t need<br/>\nto.  Same as the TV, I don&#39;t need to have incoming TV for my kids to be<br/>\nenriched.  My oldest doesn&#39;t even have a huge interest in the TV, even when<br/>\nhe goes to grandpa&#39;s who have a satilite.  He&#39;s got way more important<br/>\nthings to do, like catch a loose chik that spent last night out in a<br/>\nhorrible storm, the poor thing.  Man when you got 29 of the buggars, keeping<br/>\na count is still almost impossibe.<br/>\nBec,<br/>\nCamano Island Homeschoolers,<br/>\nWashington Unschoolers,<br/>\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/Washingtonunschoolers/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.342 / Virus Database: 189 - Release Date: 3/14/02<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34796,"nextTopicId":34773}}
