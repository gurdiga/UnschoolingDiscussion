PLUS - for <br/>\nsome people the two weeks isn&#39;t long enough to get a sense of the list <br/>\nand other people go in and read archives for hours and have picked up <br/>\non what the list is really like in only a day or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as a listowner, I ask that all those who signed onto this list <br/>\nless than two weeks ago please back out for a while, especially when <br/>\ncontroversial issues are discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour questions will come up - you don&#39;t have to bring them up right <br/>\naway. If you have a BURNING question that can&#39;t wait 2 weeks, go to <br/>\nunschooling-dotcom message boards. Or write to me personally if you <br/>\nneed to - but hold off on posting to the list. We have many years of <br/>\nexperience and have learned that the list runs much more smoothly if <br/>\npeople will follow this request.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian, Co-Listowner</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89524,"nextTopicId":89417}}
