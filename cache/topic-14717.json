Especially if<br/>\nyou have a digital camera, you can keep photos of artwork without taking up<br/>\nso much room.  That way you do have room to keep the really special ones.<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t forget to frame really nice ones to keep forever.  Dad has some<br/>\n&quot;original&quot; artwork framed and hanging is his office :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love taking pictures of my little artist standing next to or holding<br/>\nhis/her work of art, it puts more history and perspective into the art when<br/>\nyou reminisce.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14714,"nextTopicId":14719}}
