She came in once and half<br/>\n&gt; heartedly wiped a rag over the table, not really doing anything, and<br/>\n&gt; then went into another room and played around doing something else.<br/>\n&gt; I reminded her gently and kindly that if she wants me to have time to<br/>\n&gt; play her game, she would have to help me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you were upset that she didn&#39;t come in to help, then were you really<br/>\nasking? If you were asking, yes or no would have been both acceptable<br/>\nanswers. If yes, you would have the energy to play. If no, you wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at it this way, if you were somewhere and needed to clean up and your<br/>\ndaughter wanted to get home to see a TV show and you knew that you weren&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to have time to clean up without her help to get her home on time, if<br/>\nshe chose not to help, would you be angry? It would be her choice not to get<br/>\nhome on time. It was her choice not to help in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Of course it depends on the age too. Expecting a 5yo or maybe even a 10yo<br/>\nwho has been coerced into doing chores to grasp what tired and time looks<br/>\nlike from an adult point of view is asking a lot.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps this felt different because you knew you could physically play the<br/>\ngame. It felt somewhat arbitrary to say if I finish at 9 we can play, but if<br/>\nI finish at 9:15 we can&#39;t. This is a balance thing. It&#39;s learning to be more<br/>\nobjective about your daughter&#39;s needs and about what your real needs are<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut perhaps, if you know her help doesn&#39;t really cut much out of the effort<br/>\nthe task takes -- and include in there her companionship and effort if she&#39;s<br/>\ntruly interested in helping even if her help doesn&#39;t make the task go any<br/>\nfaster, a better offer would have been doing it in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kind of along these lines, I lost it with my kids this morning.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been feeling edgy for the last few days because of their behavior and<br/>\n&gt; continuous refusal to help me do much of anything, and this morning I<br/>\n&gt; just felt like I didn&#39;t even want to get out of bed and deal with<br/>\n&gt; them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your anger is all about control. You want them to be a certain way and I<br/>\nthink you&#39;re expecting to be able to use some technique to turn them into<br/>\nwhat you want them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s about them wanting not to be controlled. So right now when you ask<br/>\nthem to help, it&#39;s going to seem like you&#39;re making them help. Especially if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve used asking when no wasn&#39;t really an acceptable answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about your relationship with them. I think you&#39;re really feeling that<br/>\nmom and child division, where it&#39;s your job to get them to live the right<br/>\nway. So try to turn that on it&#39;s head and see yourself as their partner.<br/>\nThey are where they are and your job is to help them get where they want to<br/>\ngo.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than trying to change them, how about being the person you want them<br/>\nto be? I&#39;m sure you are in many ways, but you&#39;re doing it from your point of<br/>\nview. When you think you&#39;re being generous, it probably more often looks<br/>\nlike you doing something you want to do (like making the cake. Even if they<br/>\nnotice how long it takes, they have no concept of how much work it<br/>\ninvolves.) Do you want them to hold in their feelings and blow up in order<br/>\nto get people to do what you want them to do? (This shouldn&#39;t really be<br/>\nabout the cleaning, though. You should see the househould tasks as yours.<br/>\nAsk for help, certainly, but they&#39;re yours. That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t help<br/>\nthem figure out ways to make what you want to do easier. Like having bins to<br/>\nthrow things into. The more they come to see that you own the chores and<br/>\nthat you really are asking for their help and appreciate anything they can<br/>\ndo to help, the more they&#39;ll be likely to help.) How about observing them<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re doing something and asking if they need help with something?<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t you want them to do that? How about sitting down with them when<br/>\nthey&#39;re playing just to be in their company? Wouldn&#39;t that be really sweet<br/>\nif they did that? How about noticing the less noticable times when someone<br/>\nmight need a hug and giving them a hug?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat won&#39;t solve everything, but at the heart of the tension you&#39;re feeling<br/>\nin your relationship is the control thing. And it&#39;s about boundaries too.<br/>\nYou can&#39;t expect them to understand your boundaries and meet your needs. But<br/>\nyou have to be atuned to what they&#39;re needs are too. Mom&#39;s need sleep but<br/>\ninsisting that an infant set aside its needs so Mom can sleep is<br/>\nunreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\n(This is *really* hard to explain! So maybe some place in there was<br/>\nsomething that might help.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: our days may change ( how we affect\tothers)","postDate":"1044020384","msgId":57341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNUZFNkQwLjEzMzdDJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0ZC4xYjBiNGY5ZS4yYjZiMzdkNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57333,"nextInTopic":57345,"prevInTime":57340,"nextInTime":57342,"topicId":57140,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Isn&#39;t this <br/>\nauthoritarian?  (And I&#39;m genuinely asking, not picking a fight)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of along these lines, I lost it with my kids this morning.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen feeling edgy for the last few days because of their behavior and <br/>\ncontinuous refusal to help me do much of anything, and this morning I <br/>\njust felt like I didn&#39;t even want to get out of bed and deal with <br/>\nthem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur plans were to do some running around today.  We were going to go <br/>\nout to eat at Duncan Donuts, stop at the pet store, the library, and <br/>\nWal-mart.  All of these things were places that at least one of the <br/>\nkids wanted to go to for some project or another.  They all had been <br/>\nasking for donuts, and this was a good day to go.  They were <br/>\nfighting, and one of them wouldn&#39;t get his socks on.  He said that he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t, that he wanted me to get them and put them on for him.  He <br/>\nis 5 1/2 years old and more than capable of getting his own socks <br/>\non.  That pushed me over the edge, and I asked my daughter (with a <br/>\ndefinite edge in my voice) if she would please get her brother some <br/>\nsocks to wear since he refuses to cooperate with the rest of the <br/>\nfamily.  She did, and I gave them to him and I said (with even more <br/>\nof an edge in my voice) that I am sick and tired of him never doing <br/>\nanything for himself and never cooperating with anything I ask him to <br/>\ndo.  He put his socks on when he saw I was about to lose it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I held the door open and asked if everyone could please go out <br/>\nthe door and get in the car.  I asked them if they thought they could <br/>\nmanage to do it without fighting, complaining, hitting, or kicking <br/>\nanybody else.  My daughter looked at me really weird and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Mommy, what is wrong?&quot; lol  I said, &quot;Nothing, I&#39;m just in a  <br/>\nreally bad mood, so please get in the car&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we all got in the car, I decided to be honest.  I told them that <br/>\nI was sick of them always expecting me to do everything for them.  I <br/>\ntold them that no one ever cleans up their dishes or throws away <br/>\ntheir candy wrappers or puts their things away when they&#39;re done with <br/>\nthem.  I told them that I really want to do all these cool things <br/>\nwith them, but that it&#39;s been really frustrating lately. We do the <br/>\ncool things, no one EVER decides that they want to help me do any <br/>\nclean up, and while I&#39;m cleaning up, they mess up more somewhere <br/>\nelse. I told them that I CAN NOT keep up with it anymore.  I gave <br/>\nthem last night as an example.  Last night, I made a cake for my <br/>\nthree year old at his request, because we&#39;re celebrating big blue <br/>\nmonkey&#39;s birthday today. (Big Blue Monkeky is a stuffed animal) It <br/>\nwas a Thomas the tank engine cake, with lots of colored wilton <br/>\nicing.  I didn&#39;t mind doing it at all, and it was fun because he <br/>\nhelped me mix the colors in to the icing and even squeezed some of <br/>\nthe icing onto the cake.  But then dd asked me to play a game.  I <br/>\nsaid that it was getting late and the only way I could play a game <br/>\nwith her is if she would help me clean up.  She came in once and half <br/>\nheartedly wiped a rag over the table, not really doing anything, and <br/>\nthen went into another room and played around doing something else.  <br/>\nI reminded her gently and kindly that if she wants me to have time to <br/>\nplay her game, she would have to help me.  She came in again for <br/>\nmaybe 30 seconds and threw a paper towel toward the garbage can, it <br/>\nlanded on the floor, and she went to do something else.  I finished <br/>\ncleaning up all by myself and was too tired (and too annoyed!) to <br/>\nplay a game by then.  By the time I got the diningroom and kitchen <br/>\nrecovered from our cake adventure, 2 other rooms were trashed from <br/>\nthem playing and not cleaning anything up.  I was too tired to clean <br/>\nthem up, and was really discouraged because of all these people who <br/>\nsay they just keep up with the mess as soon as it happens and never <br/>\nlet anything build up.  I had just spent an hour and a half cleaning <br/>\nicing off tables and floors and doing dishes, now I was tired and <br/>\nneeded to do another 2 rooms?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI told them that it is just rude and inconsiderate of them to treat <br/>\nme like their personal maids.  I told them that if they could at <br/>\nleast put their dishes in the sink and put their things away when <br/>\nthey&#39;re done with them I would feel so much better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I told them that they were doing things to annoy each other way <br/>\ntoo often, that the level of fighting that we&#39;ve been having is <br/>\ncausing way too much stress in the house.  I told them that they just <br/>\nneed to stop constantly doing things that they know are going to <br/>\nannoy someone else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey said ok, and said that they were sorry that they&#39;ve been <br/>\ninconsiderate and that they&#39;d try to contribute more.  I felt much <br/>\nbetter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen we got home, I asked if they could please clean up the <br/>\nlivingroom so that people can walk through it and there is a <br/>\ncomfortable place for everyone to sit on the couch, because their <br/>\ngrandma and grandpa are coming over for big monkey&#39;s birthday party <br/>\nand to watch a movie with them.  My 5 year old said, &quot;I won&#39;t&quot;.  I <br/>\njust looked at him and said, &quot;That is so rude&quot;.  He looked at me, and <br/>\nthen joined the other two in cleaning up the livingroom of the at <br/>\nleast 50 stuffed animals and beanie babies (among other things) that <br/>\nthey had all over the floor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, did I mess up? <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] our days may change ( how we affect others)","postDate":"1043954620","msgId":57210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNkLjJiNDc2NTExLjJiNmFkNWJjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57203,"nextInTopic":57241,"prevInTime":57209,"nextInTime":57211,"topicId":57140,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/30/03 12:11:53 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

My husband is a pretty fragile sleeper who<br/>\ncan&#39;t get back to sleep if he&#39;s interrupted, and can&#39;t manage to sleep<br/>\npast 6am, no matter what time he goes to sleep.  My son and I do a lot<br/>\nof tiptoeing.  (But one kid just can&#39;t make as much noise as two, so I<br/>\nhave an easier situation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday dh got off work early and fell asleep on the couch in the<br/>\nafternoon.  I couldn&#39;t even go online while he was napping, as my modem<br/>\nmakes a loud screechy noise and is in earshot of the couch.  (Your post<br/>\nreminded me that I could turn down the sound on my computer, so I did that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I travel, I sleep with ear plugs, as motel noises will wake me ten<br/>\nor more times a night if I don&#39;t.  I also have an air purifier in my<br/>\nroom that makes about the same &quot;white noise&quot; as a fan.  I run that every<br/>\nnight.  I&#39;ll turn that on even if I&#39;m just reading in my bedroom to<br/>\nblock out the interrupting sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your boys, I&#39;d be tempted to forbid them access to the stairs unless<br/>\nthey are tiptoeing up to bed (or to reach you in an actual emergency). <br/>\nI&#39;d put a gate or a banner across the bottom of the stairs as a physical reminder.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor quality romantic time with your spouse, if you can&#39;t make the switch<br/>\nto love in the morning when your dh wakes up (not my favorite), then<br/>\nlock the door and maybe play some kind of loud, makeout music on the<br/>\nstereo so that not too many sounds go through the door either from<br/>\noutside or from inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m going to take my kid to the park today so he&#39;s not bouncing<br/>\noff the walls tonight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] our days may change ( how we affect others)","postDate":"1043946615","msgId":57170,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZS4yMWE5OTJiYy4yYjZhYjY3N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57142,"nextInTopic":57203,"prevInTime":57169,"nextInTime":57171,"topicId":57140,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/30/03 7:15:55 AM, grlynbl@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1404384254\">In a message dated 1/30/03 7:15:55 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   We dont have <br/>\n<br/>\nmonths for them to self regulate or learn new principles.

My <br/>\nhusband sent me this email this morning.. This has been an ongoing problem <br/>\nfor almost 3 mos.  He has to get up at  5am to drive an hour and half to work<br/>\n<br/>\n_____<br/>\nI wish we could get the kids to gradually shift toward getting to sleep <br/>\nearlier and getting up earlier. Really, after 10:00 at night - there&#39;s not <br/>\nreally all that much reason for kids to be up. There&#39;s nothing by crap on TV <br/>\n- and what is on TV isn&#39;t for children, anyway. The only stimulation the get <br/>\nis from themselves, or from us - to keep them going and staying up. I suppose <br/>\nI should just make a rule that they have to turn off the games, TV&#39;s, etc. <br/>\nand go to bed at 10:00. I can let them quiet down on their own - but if every <br/>\nnight, for an hour or 1 1/2 hours - I have to keep calling them down...then <br/>\neventually turn off games, or TV, then still have to call them down - then it <br/>\njust doesn&#39;t work for me. <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess somehow - I got this idea in my head a long time ago - that in the <br/>\nevening - the kids would go to bed and go to sleep - and the parents could <br/>\nhave a little time to relax, watch TV, talk, etc. But, that just never <br/>\nhappens.<br/>\n_____<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, after talking about this situation with Kelly, we started asking <br/>\nthem to quiet down so Dad could go to sleep.  Well, they dont.. I have had <br/>\nMANY  calm, rational talks with them along the lines of.  You can stay up til <br/>\nyou get sleepy.  But you need to stay quiet.  Use a lower voice, turn the TV <br/>\ndown.  Please dont come in our rooom unless it is an emergency.  Daddy gets <br/>\nup and goes to work very early because he loves us.   He provides for <br/>\neverything we have.  If Daddy didnt work, you couldnt have XBOX and N64 and <br/>\ntons of movies.  Daddy is very tired if he doesnt get enought sleep.   I have <br/>\noffered suggestions.. Go downstairs and &quot;play&quot;   Either they dont want to, or <br/>\nthey run up and down the stairs and still continue to make noise.   Aside <br/>\nfrom the calm discussions ( which they all agree to and understand)  I have <br/>\nturned on the bitch attitude.. OK, thats IT.. Turn off the TV. get in bed. <br/>\nNOW. this is enough... Or Dh has done the same thing.. Actually, thats what <br/>\nit has eventually turned into every night.. About 3 or 4 &quot;warnings&quot; not <br/>\nreally warnings, but.. getting up out of bed, going to their room and asking <br/>\nthem to please quiet down. . or break up a fight or ask them to turn the TV <br/>\ndown.  Then finally, laying down the law and turning the stuff off and the <br/>\nlights out.. Then they go to sleep in about 15-20 mins.. Still, its a couple <br/>\nhours after Dh NEEDS to be asleep.. And also NO &quot;private&quot; time for us. ..  <br/>\nSo, what to do?   This is not something that can just &quot;work&quot; its self out.  <br/>\nIts already been almost 3 mos of sleep deprivation for him.   We dont have <br/>\nmonths for them to self regulate or learn new principles.   We have ran out <br/>\nof creative options.  The only option left is .. what?? for my husband to <br/>\nsleep out in the garage?? pitch the tent in the yard??  Get his own place <br/>\nnearer his work?  ( not feasible, anyway)  This is a real problem..  I DO <br/>\nwant advice and suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57596,"nextTopicId":57618}}
