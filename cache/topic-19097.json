Here are a couple<br/>\nof things that I have &quot;toyed&quot; with;<br/>\nDuring the time that my girls like to sing, we made up songs as we put things<br/>\naway (this made the time go by fast and help my oldest with understanding<br/>\nrhyming words). Sometimes if the stuff being picked up was soft or non-breakable<br/>\nwe would play who could toss it into the toy box. Then of course there are times<br/>\nwhen bribing works. The bribe may only be for pennies or nickels but this works<br/>\ncurrently as my 6 yr old is counting currency now. We often trade smaller<br/>\ndenominations for the larger. When they are really stubborn, and I really need<br/>\nto have things done I will first try to give them a choice, like:  would you<br/>\nprefer to pick up your toys or clean the ferret cage?  I explain that one of the<br/>\nduties is usually mine and I would gladly switch jobs for the day. They usually<br/>\nchoose their own chore given the choice. I have, in the past, rewarded my kids<br/>\nas if they were my dogs, with TONS of praise and love and then a small treat.<br/>\nNow my dogs, were easier, they like cheese. My girls would get something like<br/>\n&quot;brownies&quot; if they did everything needed that day.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19005,"nextTopicId":18943}}
