I think the schools and courts <br/>\nare just making it so much worse there.

A kid in my neighborhood was caught breaking into houses (back in<br/>\nthe 70&quot;s).  His mom didn&#39;t know about it until he was caught.  His<br/>\npunishment was minor, but then he discovered wrestling for the school<br/>\nteam, did really great, and ended up with a college scholarship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is that a kid who is really excited about something and<br/>\nhas the opportunity to pursue it, will be less likely to spend time<br/>\ngetting into trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry things are so tough for you right now.

I haven&#39;t been around much lately...just got <br/>\nback from out of town and the whole court situation with my nephew.  We went <br/>\nto court on Monday morning, sat in the waiting area for a little over two <br/>\nhours, then went in to see the judge.  The probation officer had asked for a <br/>\ncontinuance because my nephew&#39;s mother hadn&#39;t gotten in touch with him soon <br/>\nenough for him to do his evaluation.  The judge was mad and said that if this <br/>\nhappened again, the probation officer would be talking to my nephew behind <br/>\nbars.  So he goes back on Dec. 27.  The probation officer says he will be on <br/>\ninformal probation for six monthes to a year.  He says they don&#39;t like <br/>\nindependent study so I don&#39;t know if they will make him go back to public <br/>\nschool.  I don&#39;t understand why when he&#39;s doing better this way and when we <br/>\nhave complied with California&#39;s compulsory education laws.  The probation <br/>\nofficer said to me that kids need to be in some kind of school unless they&#39;re <br/>\nlittle Einsteins, that our public schools need money, etc.  It really bothers <br/>\nme that he will let his personal and political views influence what he does <br/>\nin this capacity. <br/>\n     He asked me to write a statement, so I did.  I gave my views on how <br/>\nRicky is doing, how his learning is going, why I believe it is important for <br/>\nhim to continue as he is, etc.   I hope it does some good.  <br/>\n     Right now, I feel kind of discouraged.  I don&#39;t know how to fight their <br/>\nsystem.  I sat in that waiting area and talked to other parents in there <br/>\nabout what their kids were in there for and I was totally disgusted.  One <br/>\nwoman had a boy who was 12 or 13 and had gotten in a fight with a kid at <br/>\nschool.  He said the kid slapped him so he hit him and they fought.  On the <br/>\none hand, I don&#39;t at all think this is the right way to handle it.  On the <br/>\nother, I know that kids get in fights and have done so for many years and <br/>\nthere are better ways of handling it than to call the police and put him in <br/>\nthe court system.  I&#39;m not talking about weapons or injuries, just a typical <br/>\nfight.  Is it actually supposed to do some good to put the kid on probation <br/>\nwith the threat of juvenile hall if they have any problems at all?  One woman <br/>\nsaid that her friend&#39;s son was on probation and then got a ticket for <br/>\njaywalking so they put him in juvenile hall for a week.  <br/>\n     They can&#39;t even guarantee the safety of the kids in juvenile hall.  They <br/>\nact like it&#39;s just a little lesson for them to learn being in there.  And I <br/>\nguess if once in a while one gets gang-raped, well, that&#39;s what you get for <br/>\ngetting in a fight at school...  I guess I shouldn&#39;t even keep writing about <br/>\nthis right now because at the moment I feel angry and bitter about what <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing in that town and it&#39;s not even a constructive anger.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow what to do to fight it.  I have written to various organizations but <br/>\nnever heard back.  I know they get thousands of letters all the time so I <br/>\nguess it&#39;s against the odds to catch anyone&#39;s attention.  I have to think <br/>\nabout this and figure out how to regroup...<br/>\n     <br/>\n      Lucy in California</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5330,"nextTopicId":5262}}
