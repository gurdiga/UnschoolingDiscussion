She even went through a phase of stealing money from family members, <br/>\nand using it to buy candy. Well, about a week ago, she went through many <br/>\notter pops in the late evening(I didn&#39;t count them, but it was a lot). About <br/>\n1:30 in the morning, she had an anxiety episode, where her chest was <br/>\nhurting. This came about because she had gone out to call the dog, and the <br/>\ndog didn&#39;t come to her. The dog was in her brother&#39;s room. This missing dog <br/>\ncaused Katie to worry, and her heart to thump and she felt like she was <br/>\ngoing to throw up (reflux). I think the combination of all the sugar from <br/>\nthe many otter pops made her active and even hyper-active, then not finding <br/>\nthe dog caused the anxiety feelings. I told her all of this, and said &quot;If <br/>\nyou eat sugary things this late at night, you&#39;re setting yourself up for <br/>\nsleeplessness.&quot; Gave her some Pepto Bismol, stroked her back a little while, <br/>\nand had her sleep in a reclining chair, to avoid any more reflux. She slept <br/>\nfine after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, day before yesterday, she ate a ton of otter pops AGAIN. Not late at <br/>\nnight, it was in the afternoon. It didn&#39;t affect her emotional state or her <br/>\nbehavior, but it ticked me off, because she consumed more than two dozen <br/>\notter pops, leaving only three when we got home from running errands. I let <br/>\nher know that I was quite angry about that, and considered it to be <br/>\nextremely inconsiderate of the rest of the family for her to eat them up <br/>\nlike that. I didnt&#39; shout, but I was adamant and my tone of voice was firm. <br/>\nHer chin wobbled a bit and she said she was sorry, and had the brilliant <br/>\nidea of making popsicles out of kool-aid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were YUMMY. She made probably 30 of them, and everyone had some...and <br/>\nshe sucked down by far the most of them. At one point she said &quot;My lips are <br/>\nburning!&quot; but after a brief rest, she went back to chomping down on the <br/>\nhomemade popsicles. Again, she was consuming a lot of sugary stuff in the <br/>\nlate evening. I brought up the incident from last week, and I also asked <br/>\nabout her burning lips, but she wanted some more, so she had some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd at 4 o&#39;clock this morning, she came to my bedroom and said &quot;I haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen able to fall asleep all night. Can I sleep in here?&quot; (hubby has a night <br/>\njob) so she got in bed with me and wiggled around quite a bit, and fell <br/>\nasleep eventually.  I did say to her then, half groggy &quot;it&#39;s all the sugar <br/>\nin those kool-aid popsicles&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. We took the controls off the food a long time ago, and I&#39;ve watched <br/>\nher gain some weight (though she always has been a hearty eater) I haven&#39;t <br/>\ntold her &quot;you can&#39;t have those otter pops&quot; and have even bought more, when <br/>\nthe current box has run out (pretty stinking fast). I didn&#39;t tell her last <br/>\nnight NOT to eat the homemade popsicles.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat should I do, if anything, the next time she starts sucking down the <br/>\notter pops, or the kool aid or whatever? Even the burning lips last night <br/>\ndidn&#39;t stop her from continuing to eat the popsicles. Should I have said <br/>\n&quot;Hey, slow down there, girl&quot;? This child is not exhibiting much self control <br/>\nhere. Do I need to do something/say something to stop her? I think she&#39;s <br/>\nhurting herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106757,"nextTopicId":106634}}
