I love <br/>\nfollowing everything I hear about the kids I met at the conference.  You and James <br/>\nand Jayn stick in my mind esp., I was the one asking my daughter to find my <br/>\nson so he could have a stick to play with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t &quot;nothing&quot; that you are doing.  You are treating her like an <br/>\nintelligent being with a mind of her own.  It didn&#39;t look like you were doing nothing. <br/>\n But I feel like that at times with Frankie and Caitlin, who are my 9 and 11 <br/>\nyear old.  I  feel like people (like my mom or other family members) think I <br/>\nhave gone nuts because they &quot;answer me like that&quot; and that &quot;I allow it&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s really cool is when I see it working.  And Frank and I were talking <br/>\nthe other night about reading and how the kids may not get it right away but it <br/>\ncomes along.  Even though we talked about it,  he&#39;s still trying to get <br/>\nFrankie to sound it out.  But the things he said made me hopeful about his thinking <br/>\nprocess.  So when he tells frankie to sound it out, I cringe but I don&#39;t say <br/>\nanything, because Frankie says OH DAD, never mind.  And Frank sees the <br/>\ncommunication shutting off himself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not really that he can&#39;t read.  He has better things to do right now, <br/>\nand he is only 9.  We had some sightword flash cards out the other night and we <br/>\nwere making sentences with them.  I started with pet pig.  He ended it with <br/>\nPet pig is on drugs, using the alphabet cards to spell drugs.  Then he said Get <br/>\na grip pet pig.  And we laughed.  His thinking sounds great.  This is why <br/>\nthere is no interest for young readers.  He is thinking beyond that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStepheny<br/>\n<br/>\nI did buy mathblaster, readingblaster and spymaster, and the kids are having <br/>\nfun with that.  Frankie wouldn&#39;t touch it until he saw his sister having fun <br/>\nwith it.  They especially enjoy the spymaster.  I had thought they would <br/>\nbecause it looked like too much work to me, and that&#39;s the kind of stuff they like.  <br/>\nMe, I like books.  I&#39;m learning not to push my love of books on them.  I just <br/>\nread.  And the cool thing was Alyssa came to me, asked me what it was about, <br/>\nand just nodded.  I didn&#39;t say you should read it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90812,"nextTopicId":90816}}
