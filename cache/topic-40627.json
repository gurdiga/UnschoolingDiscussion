(I knew if I<br/>\nthrew enough words at it I&#39;d figure it out ;-) It isn&#39;t Ned&#39;s *particular*<br/>\npolitical point of view that I&#39;d like to send elsewhere. It&#39;s having a<br/>\n*single* political point of view being expressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s *very* interesting hearing a viewpoint that&#39;s so totally<br/>\ndifferent from mine. If this were the debate folder in AOL&#39;s old<br/>\nhomeschooling forum I&#39;d *love* to debate this. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we don&#39;t have a debate folder or any way of shuttling off a very large<br/>\nspecialized discussion. The list is one great big messy it. And people<br/>\nsigned up to discuss unschooling. Which means that if one person does want<br/>\nto express his political point of view if the rest of us go on discussing<br/>\nunschooling, that one person&#39;s view becomes the defacto political point of<br/>\nview of the list. I&#39;m not accusing Ned of doing that or wanting that. It&#39;s<br/>\njust how groups work. If no one disagrees, it appears everyone agrees.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to unschoolers for Ned&#39;s to be the only political<br/>\npoint of view expressed nor for it to appear he speaks for everyone. I think<br/>\nit&#39;s far more valuable for there to be a diverse political point of view.<br/>\nWhich means that since I strongly disagree with Ned that I, and anyone else<br/>\nwho values more than one viewpoint being heard, need to point out where we<br/>\ndisagree and why and discuss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPolitical discussions being the way they are, they can&#39;t be handled in a few<br/>\nshort posts. To offer a diverse -- or even just *one* other! -- political<br/>\nviewpoint the list would be taken over -- as it has for the past few days --<br/>\nby political discussion. And the people who discuss unschooling would be<br/>\nspending their energy in the political discussion. The overall quantity of<br/>\nemails would go up but the quality and quantity of unschooling discussion --<br/>\nwhich is what people signed up for -- would go down. (It&#39;s not a<br/>\nspeculation. I&#39;ve seen it happen numerous times when one discussion<br/>\noverwhelms the list. People get shorter and fewer answers to their<br/>\nunschooling questions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the choices seem to be: 1) to have one political point of view expressed,<br/>\n2) to have the list filled with political discussion or 3) to have no<br/>\npolitical points of view. (Or at least as close as can be achieved.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggesting Ned take the discussion somewhere else is like asking someone to<br/>\ntake a very loud and overwhelming specialized discussion to another room so<br/>\nthat those who came to *this* room to discuss unschooling can do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Pam suggested NHEN&#39;s Legislative list.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/NHEN-Legislative)\">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/NHEN-Legislative)</a>. There are also loads of<br/>\nother lists at Yahoo. And Ned could even start his own.
