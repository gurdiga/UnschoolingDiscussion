Sometimes I give when<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think I could.  Sometimes I say I&#39;m exhausted & can&#39;t do another<br/>\nthing until after a good night&#39;s rest.<br/>\nYou are so right that we have to nurture ourselves too.  I&#39;m doing more<br/>\nfor myself now - a monthly book club, using the childcare co-op once in<br/>\nawhile just to have a few hours alone, cooking dinners that I like best. <br/>\nI&#39;ve learned (at age 41, boy some of us are slow) that people don&#39;t read<br/>\nmy mind, so I need to tell them what I need.<br/>\nKeep up the walking and good eating, Suz.  You deserve it!<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nIf you want to do everything yourself,<br/>\ninsist on being the only one who can do it right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Mary Ellen,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean husband and wife take turns nurturing each other?<br/>\n<br/>\nI tossed this question in here because SO many evenings I feel like I<br/>\nNEED<br/>\nsome nurturing.

I sometimes feel drained.....like if I give one more thing before I<br/>\nreceive some nurturing,  then I may just BURST :-)<br/>\n    Anyway,  I suppose taking turns might work- thank you for the<br/>\nsuggestion, I hadn&#39;t though to try that<br/>\n    I have also begun my own self-nurturing,  though it&#39;s difficult to<br/>\nfind<br/>\nthe time.  I&#39;ve decided this has to be Priority!!  I have been getting up<br/>\nearlier than everyone else 4-6 mornings a week.  On these mornings I take<br/>\na<br/>\nvigorous 45 min walk.  This is my fifth week.  Some days it&#39;s tough to<br/>\nget<br/>\nup and make myself get going.....but my marks on the calendar show me how<br/>\nmuch I&#39;ve accomplished (I track the mileage/days).  I&#39;m finally starting<br/>\nto<br/>\nfeel stronger.<br/>\n    And this week I&#39;m adding focus on eating healthy.
