Although our 4-yr old girls are almost exactly the same age, <br/>\nthey have never really been friends and Morgaine plays better with <br/>\nthe older girl.  She was thrilled when the older girl invited her to <br/>\na campfire birthday party with all her school friends ... well when <br/>\nwe got there, Morgaine started playing with her new toys and the <br/>\nolder girl said, &quot;You can&#39;t play with those!  I took them out for me <br/>\nand my friends to play!&quot;  Without thinking I jumped in as Morgaine&#39;s <br/>\nface crumpled ... &quot;You invited Morgaine to your party Liv.  She is <br/>\nyour friend.&quot;  &quot;No, I invited her so my sister could have someone to <br/>\nplay with.&quot;  Morgaine was crushed and I was angry and sad, but I <br/>\nbacked off and let things alone.  I gave her the option to stay by <br/>\nherself (as planned), for me to stay with her, or to come home.  <br/>\nWhen she settled down she decided to stay by herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was a little nervous when I picked her up -- it was her first drop-<br/>\noff party and hadn&#39;t started well -- but she had a great time.  She <br/>\nhad made friends with one of the other girls and also gone into the <br/>\nhouse with my friend&#39;s other daughter for a while.  She was filthy <br/>\nand full and so proud of herself.  I had left her there in such <br/>\nfrustration, because as my friends&#39; children have gone off to public <br/>\nschool it&#39;s mostly the moms who create that &quot;ageism,&quot; and it has <br/>\nhurt Morgaine time and again to be excluded by her older friends, <br/>\nbut she worked it out.  Next time I&#39;ll try to stay out of it <br/>\naltogether.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, also when the other 4-yr old girl challenged her -- &quot;You still a <br/>\nbaaa-by.  I a big girl; I go to school,&quot;  Morgaine shot back, &quot;No, <br/>\nthat&#39;s because I go to homeschool and I get to learn all the time.&quot;  <br/>\nIt&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard her not sound defensive about not <br/>\nbeing in school.  Step by step we&#39;re getting there. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me share.  This was such a big event for us <br/>\nboth ... <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94428,"nextTopicId":94481}}
