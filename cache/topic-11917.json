I had hamsters when I was young, but I must admit<br/>\nwas pretty niave about them and their care. Then right before my husband<br/>\nand I got married we got one and surprise! three days later it had babies.<br/>\nI held on to them (or at least the ones the mom didn&#39;t eat) for 5 weeks<br/>\nthen brought the whole litter and mom and cage to the pet store, put ti<br/>\ndowna and walked out. Part of me felt bad, but I really felt that I had<br/>\nfufilled my obligation and we we&#39;re leaving for our honeymoon. O.K., now<br/>\nthat I&#39;ve made a short story long.. my 7 yo dd now wants a hamster, so  now<br/>\nthat I&#39;m older and more responsible (sometimes), I&#39;m doing my homework. My<br/>\n2 biggest concerns are determining the sex of the hamster before we buy it<br/>\n(especially making sure if it&#39;s pg or not) and what to do about our dog and<br/>\ncats.

Now for how to keep <br/>\nthe animal, we have always had cats and hampsters (usually considered a bad <br/>\ncombination), but if your hampster lives in a glass fish aquarium (without <br/>\nthe water&lt;g&gt;), you should not have a problem.  A plastic frame with mesh, <br/>\nthat fits perfectly on the aquarium, may be purchased at the pet store to <br/>\nkeep the little critter safe from the bigger critters.  Make sure you use <br/>\npine shavings, not cedar, as cedar can cause respiratory problems in <br/>\nhampsters.  An enclosed hampter excercise ball can also be purchased in the <br/>\npet store, and is a lot of fun.  It is a plastic ball with air vents that you <br/>\ncan put the hampster in and close up, then he can run around the house <br/>\nwithout causing damage, or being eaten by the bigger critters.
