That&#39;s realistic, imo. And this family is odd, but REALLY <br/>\nnice. That seems right to me. The show makes it look like they are <br/>\ndoing a classroom in their house - and yet they seem to at least have a <br/>\nvery innovative schooling approach - which shows that even those who <br/>\nschool-at-home can at least be way more interest-driven and <br/>\nchild-friendly than schools are. All-in-all I think it makes the <br/>\nhomeschoolers look smart and likable and fresh and happy and eager to <br/>\nlearn and clearly better off than their always-schooled classmates.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tuesday, June 3, 2003, at 07:48 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mattydill@...\">Mattydill@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just read something on one of these emails about TV time.

Is it correct <br/>\nthat some of you believe that TV time should not be limited?  I am pretty much a <br/>\nperson who lets the kids set their own day.  They do ask before they watch TV <br/>\nor play video games and they easily break away from it when told to, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t set *limits*.  I find that their choices are pretty much within reason... <br/>\nagain by my own standards... not by others&#39;.  ~Kris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72263,"nextTopicId":72237}}
