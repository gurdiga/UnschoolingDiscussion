They cast the show, set up a  <br/>\nrehearsal schedule, came up with costumes (did not sew them, modified  <br/>\nthrift store purchases and listed for many of the kids what they  <br/>\nneeded to get for themselves), they found props, the got one of the  <br/>\nmoms who plays the accordion to play the music and a kid with a  <br/>\nkeyboard to do special effects.   They called around and searched  <br/>\nuntil they found a high school that would let them use their theater  <br/>\nfor one night, for a fee. They also hired two high school kids to run  <br/>\nsome lighting. They got the money to pay for this by having everybody  <br/>\nbring goodies to sell before the show, at intermission, and after the  <br/>\nshow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey needed some adult help when they had too many kids at rehearsal  <br/>\nat the same time - crowd control help. They needed adult help to get  <br/>\nthe theater use squared away. And they ended up needing some adults  <br/>\nbackstage to help get all the kids off and on stage with all their  <br/>\nprops, etc., at the right times (that&#39;s because the girls putting ON  <br/>\nthe play also had major roles and so couldn&#39;t supervise backstage  <br/>\nduring the show).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night - one wonderful performance.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEN they did it again - this time they wrote it themselves and  <br/>\nhandled even more of it themselves, with a number of adults providing  <br/>\nsupport. For this one. First, they held a 6 week acting workshop -  <br/>\none hour per week - for younger kids. Then they auditioned and cast  <br/>\nthe show. This was somewhat fewer kids - no big ensemble numbers -  <br/>\nand much easier to do.  They didn&#39;t charge for tickets, but they did  <br/>\nhave a big bake sale, again, and they asked for contributions. They  <br/>\npretty much just covered their expenses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is doable. Just help her take one step at a time. Help her keep it  <br/>\nsimpler rather than complicated, whenever possible. Remind her that  <br/>\nher FIRST show doesn&#39;t need to be the most elaborate - she can build  <br/>\non her experience and do other shows later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - warn ALL the adults involved that this is going to be  <br/>\nprimarily a kid-directed activity. Make it REALLY clear to them  <br/>\nbefore they get involved - otherwise you can end up with a terrible  <br/>\nsituation of adults actually complaining about a child&#39;s competence.  <br/>\nRemind them that the mistakes will be charming!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 24, 2005, at 4:13 AM, Jennifer Blair wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   My 10 yod Jackie wants to produce/direct a play.

It seems overwhelming to me also and I am currently in place where I am trying to not be discouraging and my biggest fear is that I don&#39;t want her to come away from the experience feeling unsupported. I&#39;ll share what she has done so far, maybe it will give you some ideas...<br/>\nShe has so far developed a story line, written a narrative introduction and character descriptions, designed costumes shared the idea with her friends and has begun auditions and one friend ( who loves to write) is writing the actual script. They have begun asking around for places to perform and are in the beginning stages of working out a budget. I am finding that I haven&#39;t had to facilitate anything yet and quite a bit has been done. As it gets down to needing more rehearsal time and getting everyone together it may get harder, but really it can be done in about a weeks time of intensive work, for which we may just create a backyard theater camp to facilitate. She has already realized that it will take a long time to complete and may decide at some point to simplify a bit. <br/>\nI&#39;m feeling the most support I can give her is helping her problem solve when and if issues come up, help her find solutions without rescuing her, which I have made it clear from the beginning that I would help if asked but it wasn&#39;t going to become my play ( like I will teach her to sew but I will not sew the costumes...My only other suggestion is to attend performances and see if she wants to take a theater class. <br/>\nBreak a leg,<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: nellebelle&lt;mailto:nellebelle@...&gt; <br/>\n  To: UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 23, 2005 10:23 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] making plays and movies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My 10 yod Jackie wants to produce/direct a play.

Suggestions?  Questions to ask her to help figure out what<br/>\nkind of experience she really wants?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who has spent my whole professional life in both theater and<br/>\nfilm, there is not necessarily anything &quot;easier&quot; in the different media. To<br/>\nbe honest making a video means fewer performances, but a lot more<br/>\nwork/organization during principal photography - and then you have to edit<br/>\nit (presumably you are thinking of her using your computer). It may not be<br/>\ngetting everyone together at the same time, but there is still a lot of<br/>\nplanning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever both share some basic questions that I would suggest asking or<br/>\njotting down if you already know:<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is the intended audience? Family, family and friends, your local group,<br/>\nthe general public?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom this comes the idea of the venue - your living room, your back yard,<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s home, church or community hall, outdoors at a park (not the<br/>\nvideo showing I guess)....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of project? Already chosen, or self written, group generated,<br/>\nadapting an existing story of some kind (eg a well known fairy tale), an<br/>\nexisting play (that could also be a film script)? Narrative, cabaret/skits,<br/>\nperformance art?<br/>\n<br/>\nWho would be the actors? You and her family, her friends, puppets/animation,<br/>\nhas one of her friends devised the proposal and come to her to be involved,<br/>\nwas it something grander in scale with adult participants?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first suggestion would be to look into your local community/college<br/>\ntheaters. Aside from the possibility that they may have a specific program<br/>\naimed at enticing kids into the theater, these little places suffer a<br/>\nchronic shortage of volunteers to do all kinds of fun work like set painting<br/>\nor props manufacture; she might be able to participate depending on their<br/>\npolicies and insurance issues :/. It might be a good way for her to get an<br/>\nidea of the scope of the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been really happy to have an enthusiastic youngster come<br/>\neither to the theater or on certain independent movie sets (not allowed on a<br/>\nUnion set of course) wanting to help and learn. I remember one kid, about<br/>\n11, who did a faux finish (I showed him how then left him to it like any<br/>\nother artisan) on one of the floors on a set that I was designing for his<br/>\nmother&#39;s short film project. I was not yet a mother, and it never occurred<br/>\nto me to speak to him &quot;like a kid&quot;...I heard from his mom later that he was<br/>\nso thrilled to be treated &quot;just like an adult&quot; by me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso small local theaters have facilities and other useful resources like<br/>\npeople, existing costumes and props that they may be able to help her with<br/>\nin her own project. <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to email me privately.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Even  <br/>\nplastercine can be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure that there is some sort of bendy metal ( a wire coathanger  <br/>\nfor example ) inside the model as this makes it easier to position.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she will need some sort of background - a shoe box turned  <br/>\nsideways or a felt board to use as the back ground would look nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it is a series of photographs taken against the background of  <br/>\nthe model ( animals work well ) each one in the same pose but  <br/>\nsomething moved. For example if you have a man and want to see him  <br/>\nwaving in the film, take the first picture, then move his arm  <br/>\nslightly upwards, take another picture, move the arm downwards again  <br/>\nor higher, take another picture and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when you have lots of pictures, import them into the computer  <br/>\nand run them in sequence as a slide show. You can create transitions  <br/>\nbetween each picture if desired.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be achieved with a video camera in much the same way taking  <br/>\nfilm for about three to four seconds, pause, move object, then film  <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever move anything in the background that is not supposed to move as  <br/>\nthis upsets the overall look of the piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 100&#39;s of websites about Claymation and Clay Animation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nA fine example would be Wallace and Gromit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter really gets into this, she can narrate a sound track  <br/>\nto play over the finished movie with a story in her own voice. Add  <br/>\nmusic or sound effects etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, text files can be created to run along the bottom of the movie.  <br/>\nJust paste some text on top of each photograph during the editing  <br/>\nprocess and then add the finished photograph with text pasted on to  <br/>\nthe slide show.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe creative prospects are endless with this type of thing. We use  <br/>\nplaydough which I make up in different colours in our house. Silver  <br/>\nfoil looks good on film but not so good in photographs for the back  <br/>\ndrop.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen J.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 24 Oct 2005, at 03:23, nellebelle wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My 10 yod Jackie wants to produce/direct a play.
