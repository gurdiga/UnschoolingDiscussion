We <br/>\ngenerally stretch the answers a bit not just yes and no but <br/>\nperhaps &quot;it used to be&quot; as in a cotton tablecloth &#39;used to be&#39; plant <br/>\nor &#39;is made from&#39; plant. Typically, right after &quot;is it alive?&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;was it ever alive?&quot; we move on to &quot;is it made by people?&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;is it made of....(wood, metal, plastic, fabric, etc)?&quot; Some of <br/>\nthe hardest ones have been the really simple everyday things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is (or was) a 20 questions type board game. One team <br/>\nwould read clues, one at a time. The quicker you got the answer the <br/>\nmore points you got - if it took 5 clues, 20-5=15 points; If it took <br/>\n18 clues 20-18=2 points; and so on. I think the categories were <br/>\nperson, place, thing rather than animal, vegetable, mineral.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205204590,"authorName":"andre whetstone","from":"andre whetstone &lt;tuathadedans@...&gt;","profile":"tuathadedans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] 20 questions","postDate":"1133445153","msgId":110390,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjAxMTM1MjMzLjE4OTU1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwNDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDN0M0OTE2NDdEOTcwNS0xQTQ4LTE2MDZDQEZXTS1NMTkuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":110388,"nextInTopic":110392,"prevInTime":110389,"nextInTime":110391,"topicId":110375,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"we have thad this game for over 1 yr.... we have used other as - a can of pop - a triangle - paper - mouse trap  and the like I am sure these probably  could","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-691358440\">we have thad this game for over 1 yr.... we have used other as - a can of pop - a triangle - paper - mouse trap  and the like I am sure these probably  could fit into one of the other 3 catagoties but I think it is a catch all - we have only been able to stump it once before ... but right now the kids can&#39;t think of what we used to stump it... its a challenge and a hoot!<br/>\n  andre&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n   <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: nellebelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just bought an electronic 20 questions game.
