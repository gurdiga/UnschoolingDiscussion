What has been your experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Welcome Tarasine. Nice name but I have reason to say so. My oldest <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s name is Tara and one set of her very Italian grandparents called <br/>\nher from a baby, Tarasine. You have to put in the Italian accent though. It <br/>\nwas term of endearment for her and it still sticks today. So welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if I qualify to answer this but I can only go by what I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nand heard. My little ones know that college is an option and not a <br/>\nprerequisite to life beyond the teen years. My oldest that attends school <br/>\nknows the same thing. Sierra (6)has already decided that she wants to start <br/>\ncollege at 16 and not wait until she&#39;s older. But then again she says she&#39;s <br/>\nnever moving from home either!!! All subject to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homeschoolers I know of have gone to some kind of college whether it was <br/>\ndual enrollment at 16, community college at 18 or a University. Haven&#39;t <br/>\nreally kept up with who finished or not and what they did with it. I know of <br/>\n3 that haven&#39;t gone on to school. Two of those 3 have started their own <br/>\nbusinesses. Some of those kids were unschoolers and when the time came to <br/>\ntake their SAT&#39;s, they took it upon themselves to learn what they needed. <br/>\nThey did well and were accepted into all schools that they applied to. Some <br/>\nof the children I speak of had diploma&#39;s from on line school programs, some <br/>\nhad a GED and some had nothing. All I know of took the SAT. Now I also know <br/>\nsome college&#39;s dont&#39; require an SAT at all. Who knows what the next 10 years <br/>\nwill show us with what colleges want or expect?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschoolers and college","postDate":"1031685547","msgId":43627,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdlLjJkN2EwNzVhLjJhYWY5ZmFiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43611,"nextInTopic":43644,"prevInTime":43626,"nextInTime":43628,"topicId":43611,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/10/02 11:41:44 AM Central Daylight Time, ...

If not, fine. My goals for my kids are <br/>\nthat when they grow up they are happy, healthy, and in love with their lives. <br/>\nBut those are my goals for my kids today as well.

My name is Tarasine<br/>\n(pronounced &#39;tara-seena&#39;), and although my son is only 8 months old, I<br/>\nhave been thinking about and researching homeschooling/unschooling for<br/>\nabout 5 years now.

I want my<br/>\nchildren to have time/space/freedom to learn this way from the very<br/>\nbeginning, so I am extremely grateful to have come across so many<br/>\nfabulous resources about unschooling as well as real-life unschoolers<br/>\nbefore sending them to school was ever an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here&#39;s my question.
