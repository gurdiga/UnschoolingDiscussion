Has anyone done this, am I crazy?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think food fights only work when they&#39;re spontaneous, and at the table.  <br/>\nAnd they&#39;re never a really good thing.  I&#39;ve been involved in some light ones, <br/>\nat medieval feasts.  Not nice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTaking it out and using food as the materials in the  yard, as though it were <br/>\na planned snowball fight with a starting time wouldn&#39;t be classic &quot;food <br/>\nfight&quot; but instant mashed potatoes and raw eggs are both pretty cheap.  Oatmeal.  <br/>\nJello.  Maybe you could make some things like that and have a minor <br/>\ndemonstration foodfight.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe classic item is peas, launched with a fork.  Those are cheap too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you live near an egg farm you can get B-grade eggs very inexpensively if <br/>\nthey want to throw eggs.  Tell them NOT to throw eggs ever ever at cars <br/>\n(because of damage to the paint job) or windows (because they can break) or anything <br/>\nthat needs to smell good later.  Back cinder-block walls, dirt roads, <br/>\ndriveways...   my kids have thrown eggs in those places when they wanted to see what <br/>\nit was like to break an egg with force.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it would hurt to throw eggs at people, so that&#39;s better for target stuff <br/>\nor just the heck of it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLima beans.
