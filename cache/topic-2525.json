When<br/>\nyou are starting out, the problem is to look at what the proper foundation<br/>\nis and when you need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids decide they want to build their own house in your backyard. You<br/>\nget them books on basic carpentry and housebuilding. When they are ready to<br/>\nstart, you insist that they must first dig a trench and pour concrete for<br/>\nthe footing. That&#39;s how your house was built and your parents&#39;, and all of<br/>\nyour neighbors&#39; houses, and that&#39;s what the books recommend. &quot;But mom,&quot; your<br/>\nkids complain, &quot;that doesn&#39;t make sense for a treehouse!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you need the same foundation for &quot;straw bale&quot; construction, a houseboat,<br/>\nan RV? They are all houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when do you build that foundation? True, most conventional houses you<br/>\nsee are resting on firm foundations, but do you see builders going out and<br/>\nputting in foundations all over the place because one day someone might want<br/>\nto build a house on that site? No, usually the foundation isn&#39;t put in until<br/>\nsomeone has made a firm commitment to put up their house. It can be a waste<br/>\nof resources to build lots of foundations that may never be completed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say math is different? There is only one kind of math, one right answer,<br/>\nand one right way to get it? Not true. A lot of people are surprised that<br/>\nthe very first book in the Miquon math series introduces multiplying<br/>\nfractions. Most traditional math programs don&#39;t even get into multiplying<br/>\nfor beginning math, much less multiplying fractions. Traditional math says<br/>\nyou can&#39;t work with fractions or multiplication until you build the<br/>\nfoundation first, but Miquon presents the concepts in such an easy to<br/>\nunderstand way that it becomes part of the foundation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you get the answer to 3x9? Do you automatically spit out 27 because<br/>\nyou memorized the multiplication tables? How many people (like me) think of<br/>\nthe problem as 3x10 then deduct 3 (making the problem 3x10-3x1 because 9 is<br/>\n1 less than 10). It seems less efficient, but it works better for some<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are different strategies for doing math and children can be encouraged<br/>\nto develop those skills as they need them. Doing woodworking, sewing or<br/>\nhaving an allowance can present ample opportunities and motivation for<br/>\nlearning math.<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\n<br/>\n&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/&#92;/<br/>\nF.U.N.

The<br/>\nother day he picked a game from Number Jugglers, a book of math-related card<br/>\ngames. He always picks the hardest game involving complicated equations, even<br/>\nthough he can only do simple ones (he&#39;s 6).  Then he gets frustrated and I get<br/>\nfrustrated trying to explain harder math concepts when we haven&#39;t done the<br/>\neasier concepts yet.

Back to the issue - all things need a<br/>\nfoundation if you plan to build on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory is about the only subject that I don&#39;t see this in - you can pick<br/>\nany time frame and learn fine about it without a lot of build up - usually<br/>\n- not totally.

We talk about what it<br/>\nmeans to choose not to work on math or writing or read certain types of<br/>\nmaterial (the young woman never reads fiction.. only nonfiction) I think<br/>\nyou&#39;re forgetting that you are still living and working and being with your<br/>\nchildren.  We spend time talking about what&#39;s included in different<br/>\nprofessions, what makes life enjoyable.  Math is part and parcel of those<br/>\ndiscussions.  There are math materials here to look over and mess around<br/>\nwith.  She makes her choices, just with lots and lots of input, sometimes<br/>\neven with disapproval of her choice.  I think she ought to read more and I<br/>\nsay so.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe says I ought to spend less time on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nStalemate! Or maybe Checkmate! &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Campbell & Wyman","from":"Campbell & Wyman &lt;brynlee@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"g1X5If-Q2S1lg4fCi8D5DLQhyBIgpYh8BpVFevEhMvCp0zMrzFCzyk1EWFX4Kmj-u7xD6CMkjBB1BL9sk6lyIBMTvBj2TGLOBl5Vb3ngzmKV","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling or Eclectic?
