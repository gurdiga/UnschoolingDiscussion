(puh-enzyme action my eye! that&#39;s the last time I buy<br/>\ninto that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere this cat litter called Feline Pine.  I really suggest you try it! It&#39;s<br/>\nexpensive, 9 dollars a bag, but so long as you remove the tootsie rolls<br/>\nthere is no smell, no tracking and it is very light, easy to change.  I ran<br/>\nout of it and had to use my emergency litter (multiple cat formula gritty<br/>\nkitty).  I put only about an inch in and change it every other day (I have 5<br/>\npans!) but the smell returns before I change it.  (I can&#39;t bear the thought<br/>\nof changing the litter more than that! Eek!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest problem right now is the kitchen floor.  There&#39;s carpet in there,<br/>\nand after multiple kitty messes, potty training mistakes (poor Abraham, just<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember to go to the bathroom!) and doggy piddles (brother in law&#39;s<br/>\nenglish springer spaniel) the musty odor will not go away! Yuck.  Yesterday<br/>\nwe invested in a dehumidifier. (What an exciting way to spend money.) The<br/>\nodor from the cats is non existent now yay!! but the kitchen floor smells<br/>\nhideous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to try the dial suggestion.
