He went a little<br/>\noverboard with all that in Number of the Beast. I had a psychologist friend<br/>\nof mine who had heard (how&#39;s that for &quot;has to be true&quot;?) that RAH had<br/>\ndeveloped some sort of personality disorder/brain problem in his last few<br/>\nyears that led to his increasingly odd later novels. He is one of the few<br/>\nwriters that have distinct periods; his juvenile novels, the transition<br/>\nones, the adult, and then what I think of as the weird period. Speaking of<br/>\n&quot;grok,&quot; there&#39;s a Napster-type service dh uses called &quot;grokster&quot; and he<br/>\npronounces it with a long O instead of rhyming with clock. Drives me crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s times like this that I realize...
