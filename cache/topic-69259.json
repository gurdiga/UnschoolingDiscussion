The shift going <br/>\non in our family is really powerful. My 10yo Megan and I have had some really <br/>\ncool discussions lately. My mom loved me, but was never there for me in this <br/>\ncapacity. I am so thankful for these conversations between my daughter and <br/>\nme. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of good ones in the car on the way somewhere, she has said she wishes <br/>\nwe could spend all the time in the car because we get along best and talk so <br/>\nmuch. Some good ones have been coming at the end of an argument that would <br/>\nusually not stop like this before. In other words, I would stew for a long <br/>\nperiod of time and not be able to let go of my anger, and the opportunities <br/>\nfor talking it out never happened. I still struggle with this. It&#39;s hard to <br/>\nstop focusing on my own feelings to be there and listen and talk with my <br/>\ndaughter. It&#39;s changing, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were talking today after she said something that hurt my feelings and I <br/>\ngot really mad and defensive. She said she hadn&#39;t meant it. I told her of <br/>\ncourse she meant it, and she said NO. She said &quot;my mouth is an early riser <br/>\nand my mind sometimes sleeps in.&quot; She said why is it that I(mom) could do <br/>\nsomething or say something and apologize and get forgiveness, but she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t? It froze me in my tracks. She is so right about so many things, it <br/>\njust floors me. I have had to humble myself to her more than once when she <br/>\nsees me being a hypocrite.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were also talking about she gets upset and starts feeling like she is <br/>\nalways wrong and doesn&#39;t do anything right. She always thinks I am right <br/>\nabout everything and loves to prove me wrong. I told her I&#39;m not and she has, <br/>\nand it makes us closer, if we&#39;re honest. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said she wants to be an adult, and know everything. I told her I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow everything, I make big mistakes (the whole school portion of her life), <br/>\nand I think it&#39;s more important to learn about what thrills her and know how <br/>\nto find the answer to anything else, and how to learn from mistakes and not <br/>\npretend to know everything and always be right. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about how lots of kids want to be grown up, because it would mean <br/>\nthey have some control of their life. Instead, they exert their power on <br/>\nother kids to try to feel like they are in control. She is very familiar with <br/>\nthat. And we were able to say that she is as close to being in contol of her <br/>\nlife as possible, as close to being a grown up, without the worries and fears <br/>\nthat children don&#39;t realize adults have. By being unschooled and living and <br/>\nlearning and sleeping and eating all by her own choosing. Mom still needing <br/>\nto let go even more, but a long way we&#39;ve come.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said she wishes I would never say &quot;no&quot;, but knows that isn&#39;t realistic. I <br/>\nsay &quot;no&quot; a lot less than I used to, because I am not trying to control her as <br/>\nmuch. I try to say &quot;yes&quot; more and more, which is the opposite of the way I <br/>\nused to be. I used to be controlling and punitive all the time, demanding to <br/>\nknow who she thinks she is (caught myself saying it again the other day-- i <br/>\nhate that), how dare she try to be an equal to her father and I, she should <br/>\nknow her place, blah blah blah. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t like that so much anymore. I now know she is practicing for the time <br/>\nwhen she is on her own. She needs not do as I say, not as I do. I am <br/>\nmodelling behavior for my kids, and never quite realized the impact before. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I wish I didn&#39;t have to come from negativity on our journey to peace, <br/>\nit is amazing the DUH moments that I get along the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for everyone involved in my unschooling journey, helping heal years of <br/>\nnegativity and celebrating peace. <br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69258,"nextTopicId":69270}}
