My oldest daughter lives on her <br/>\nown in an apartment within a few miles of me.  She works hard and long hours, <br/>\nshe often brings work home with her.  She lives alone, no pets.  Her dog she <br/>\ngot in college is here, by her choice, we are all here.  She enjoys company, <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t so much like to cook.  She comes over most nights for dinner.  A <br/>\nfairly new habit is her having Friday night dinner/game night at one of her <br/>\nfriends parents from work.  Do I resent that?  Of course not, I&#39;m happy that <br/>\nshe enjoys the company of others and is being fed and having a fun time.  Do <br/>\nI feel rejected that she went to Kari&#39;s instead of here?  Not at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son lives in his own house, farther away than my daughter but still <br/>\nin our town.  He works hard, long hours, often driving four hours each day to <br/>\nand from work.  His girlfriend works, sometimes, she doesn&#39;t like to cook at <br/>\nall.  He likes to eat here.  He likes to get his meals served to him.  He <br/>\nlikes that someone thought about what he likes and doesn&#39;t when preparing a <br/>\nmeal.  He likes to spend time with his family and fool around with his <br/>\nbrother and sisters and dad and he likes sometimes to have long talks with <br/>\nhis mother.  He has lots of bills to pay.  Adult life is sometimes a <br/>\nstruggle.  He&#39;s recovering from a drug problem in his past.  He&#39;s learning to <br/>\nbe a strong adult and find his way in the world.  Sometimes he will call and <br/>\nsay he can&#39;t make it for dinner but he will be around later for dessert.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s fine with me too.  Sometimes he&#39;s tired and he doesn&#39;t come over at <br/>\nall and just orders in.  I don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do find joy in having all my children gathered around the table, eating and <br/>\nconversing and loving one another but it&#39;s not something I would resent my <br/>\nchildren for if they didn&#39;t show up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I never saw my children I would miss them terribly, I would long for their <br/>\ncompany, I&#39;d probably go visit them but I would never resent them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome is a refuge to them, a place to know you are loved, that you are taken <br/>\ncare of, a familiar place.  My oldest daughter once said to me that when she <br/>\nturned in to the neighborhood (coming home from college) it felt almost like <br/>\na cozy worn wonderful quilt was being wrapped around her and walking in the <br/>\ndoor to the smell of her favorite foods was like climbing up in your mothers <br/>\nlap and snuggling when she was little.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could you ever be resentful of such wonderful creatures as your children? <br/>\n Wait, I know you could, my mother hated every minute of motherhood.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t, I love it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon enough they will have families and even more life demands than the do <br/>\nalready.  Why NOT do the little things they enjoy and look forward to while <br/>\nyou can?<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I do for my children comes from a place of love.  If they don&#39;t <br/>\nwant it, they are free to say so.  I&#39;ve been told no many times and I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever resented my children, I only took it as their right to say no about <br/>\nsomething that concerns them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is often times hard when you are just beginning on your own.
