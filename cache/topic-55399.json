She can also wear ladies size 14.. but, like others have <br/>\nsaid.. they dont fit right.. they are too long( the pants, I mean.. shirts <br/>\nare usually OK).  I have TONS, I mean LOADS of girls plus sized clothes if <br/>\nanyone is interested  I have size 10 1/2 up to 16 1/2.  I know this is not a <br/>\n&quot;for sale&quot; list.. but, since a few folks have mentioned it, I thought it <br/>\nmight help if anyone is looking for some special sizes for girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55214,"nextTopicId":55400}}
