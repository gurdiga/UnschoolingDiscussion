They should understand how ours, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; some other major political systems operate, and their place in them. They<br/>\n&gt; will need a woking knowledge of computers and their trappings as well.  A<br/>\n&gt; thorough education should also include an appreciation of, and perhaps<br/>\n&gt; experience creating, the fine arts, a healthy dose of multi-cultural<br/>\n&gt; experiences and some theology. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would agree that these things are important, but I&#39;m not sure that each<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;every person needs to touch on these things in order to be *educated*.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;.  Also remember, this is the<br/>\n&gt; opinion of a single, fallible individual, and I may be leaving something<br/>\n&gt; out. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We all leave something out!! I have no interest in knowing so many things.  <br/>\n&gt;Ancient Chinese History just holds nothing for me...... but to another it <br/>\n&gt;could be life changing.  Now ask me about babies, midwifery, unschooling. <br/>\n&gt;some theology, politics....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is precisely what I was talking about when I said different<br/>\nindividuals would find different focuses and interests within and outside<br/>\nof all that I mentioned.  Of course, when I mention touching on world<br/>\nhistory, I don&#39;t mean ALL of it.  Unless you aspire to a career as a docent<br/>\nor professor or something.  I harbor great interests in herbalism,<br/>\npaganism, native American cultures, medieval Europe, theology, child<br/>\npsychology, fantasy and myth and a number of other things that I have<br/>\nfocused on more than other things in my own self learning.  The description<br/>\nI gave is my own personal list of what comprises a &quot;good&quot; education for ME.<br/>\n I would also hope that my children would want to emulate some of that list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my strong belief that education is a lifelong adventure and I hope my<br/>\nchildren never want to stop learning.  I look forward to a lifetime of<br/>\ndiscovery with them, and the enjoyment of experiencing their &quot;firsts&quot; from<br/>\nmy now very special perspective as a mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope for this list and the contacts made here is that we can all ramble<br/>\naround together, live and learn together, maybe some of us get to know each<br/>\nother personally - the better to enrich each others&#39; lives!<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105,"nextTopicId":109}}
