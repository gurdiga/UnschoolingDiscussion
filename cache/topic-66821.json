I&#39;d just been to the supermarket (8 Miles from here) and was coming<br/>\nback with 4 groaning panniers (bout 40 pounds of groceries) when he swore at me for being on the bike trail and went past. 10 minutes later I catch up with him at the foot of a hill and then proceed to<br/>\nbreeze past him going up-hill. In my mirror i could see him cursing me and turning red with effort. He nearly gave himself a hernia trying to pass me on my laden bike and normal everyday clothes.
