And there were <br/>\nteachers who really resented the whole whole-language, etc. approach - they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to work that hard, put that much thought into what was happening <br/>\nin their classroom, develop that MUCH interesting stimulating stuff to do, <br/>\npay attention to each child individually and notice what each one was REALLY <br/>\ndoing. They just wanted to give out standard assignments and grade them and <br/>\nbe done with it. And, being resentful of having whole language forced on them <br/>\n- they sabotaged it - they needed to prove it wouldn&#39;t really work. They were <br/>\nright, of course. It was doomed from the start -- I feel really lucky my kids <br/>\ngot into some of the experimental first tries at it - with teachers who had <br/>\nfallen in love with the idea and wanted, badly, to make it work. None of them <br/>\nare doing it anymore - the return to the old kind of standardized testing and <br/>\nthe amount of huge time that is now required to be spent on systematic <br/>\nphonics programs and back-to-basics math programs - usurped much of the time <br/>\nthey had for all the cool stuff they used to do. There were two of those <br/>\nteachers who really stood out - I talked to both of them in the last 6 <br/>\nmonths. One is out of teaching - is running a program for kids with reading <br/>\ndisabilities in which she uses whole-language ideas. The other is still there <br/>\n- but very very discouraged about her career choice now.<br/>\n<br/>\n I really do think that whole language and integrated curriculum and basing <br/>\neverything on Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences was a HUGE step in the <br/>\nright direction - in theory and in having a lot of beneficial side results. <br/>\nHowever, in practice, in schools where kids are compelled to be there and <br/>\nmostly confined to spending their time in their classroom with only the <br/>\nresources available there and with 20 to 40 other kids and one adult, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t reasonable to expect whole language/integrated curriculum/multiple <br/>\nintelligence theory/authentic assessment, etc. to really work out all that <br/>\nwell. I think it made classrooms MUCH MUCH better places - in the sense that <br/>\nthe teachers who really put their heart into trying to do all that are <br/>\nundoubtedly better teachers and their classrooms way way better places to <br/>\nserve time in now. But I think it was way too much to expect from most <br/>\nteachers and they either were just no good at it or didn&#39;t try or tried <br/>\nreally hard and burned out. AND - the level of chaos in most classrooms - <br/>\nwith 20 to 40 kids all &quot;doing their own thing&quot; and many of them coming to <br/>\nschool with major personal issues and not wanting to be there anyway and <br/>\nneeding WAY more outside big-play time and so on -- the idea that whole <br/>\nlanguage, etc., could &quot;work&quot; starts to kind of seem silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHole Earth Education  --- WHEE? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what we do - gives away my age, of course, since it refers to the <br/>\nWhole Earth Catalog (which actually still sort of exists as the Whole Earth <br/>\nReview but isn&#39;t the mind-boggling exciting catalog of wonderful <br/>\nstuff-of-all-kinds that opened our minds and expanded our consciousnesses in <br/>\nthe late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at some of the terminology used here from the Whole Earth people - <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t it just WORK so well for how so many of us view what we are doing <br/>\ninstead of sending our kids to school?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Whole Earth is committed to a vision of what&#39;s needed to challenge <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ingrained patterns and stale assumptions.

Kids use math and get better at it<br/>\nwhich allows them use it more and therefore get even better at it. They<br/>\nlearn how numbers work by &quot;seeing&quot; them work and messing around with them<br/>\nand seeing them in appropriate contexts.

Now Kathryn in 11 years has certainly<br/>\n(frequently ;-) heard the word &quot;frequently&quot; but in order to get the joke she<br/>\nneeded to know exactly what it meant so she asked &quot;Does it mean all the time<br/>\nor most of the time or ...?&quot; Obviously she&#39;s picked up from the context over<br/>\nthe years that frequently had to do with how often something happened but<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t know exactly.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually she would have developed a clearer idea of what frequently means<br/>\nby hearing it used in various contexts. And she&#39;s undoubtedly full of words<br/>\nwith varying degrees of fuzzy definitions. (Me too!) (It also makes me<br/>\nrealize that though kids appear to understand what we&#39;re saying, they&#39;re<br/>\nunderstanding can often be piecemeal with them filling in the gaps with best<br/>\nguesses -- that may not always be right.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same with math. Kathryn uses the concept of percetages correctly<br/>\nmore often than not now, not because she&#39;s been taught better (I haven&#39;t at<br/>\nall) but because she&#39;s had more everyday exposure in ways that make sense to<br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re; Phonics, Key to reading","postDate":"1027765712","msgId":39520,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NjdFRTEwLkFFMkMlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0LjIzNjc5N2Q4LjJhNzM5NGFhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39518,"nextInTopic":39524,"prevInTime":39519,"nextInTime":39521,"topicId":39495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We played games, <br/>\nanswered questions, read together. I left love notes on his pillow and tucked <br/>\nencouraging quips into his pockets. He copied his favorite book on the <br/>\ntypewriter, and learned to use whiteout. He went to school and he learned to <br/>\nread and we gave them the credit for teaching him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first unschooled child learned to read while I was researching how to <br/>\nteach her to read. We played a lot of games - bought games, homemade games, <br/>\nmade up on the spot verbal games. I read aloud for hours while she looked at <br/>\nthe pages. She asked questions and I answered. I pointed out interesting <br/>\nsigns. She pointed out interesting signs. Her dad recorded tapes of him <br/>\nreading her favorite bedtime books so she could listen to them while he was <br/>\naway at sea. I wrote love notes to her and she wrote back. She copied her <br/>\nfavorite book on the computer (Commodore 64!). She labeled the house with my <br/>\nhelp. She learned to read easily and we gave her the credit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy third unschooled child learned to read in much the same way his older <br/>\nsister had. I read aloud for hours, but he didn&#39;t look at the pages very much <br/>\nbecause he was usually rolling around on the floor. We played games, but not <br/>\nas intensely as I had with his older sister. He asked questions and I <br/>\nanswered. He loved to help me make the shopping list, going through the <br/>\nweekly ads looking for the best deals. He played phonics games on our new <br/>\nMacintosh computer. He liked getting love notes but wasn&#39;t much interested in <br/>\nwriting his own back until much later. He spent months compulsively reading <br/>\naloud EVERY SINGLE sign we passed in our travels. He learned to read easily <br/>\nand we gave him the credit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy fourth unschooled child learned to read unlike any of her siblings. In <br/>\nspite of the fact that she intensely wanted to learn to read very young, and <br/>\nthe fact that we have a family culture that values games and word play, where <br/>\nphonics awareness sometimes seems to permeate the very air, she had a very <br/>\nhard time learning to read. She couldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; phonics. She was well over <br/>\neight years old before she understood rhyming. She had an awesome vocabulary <br/>\nand precise pronunciation of the words in that vocabulary - and she was <br/>\nutterly unable to break those words down into their constituent sounds. The <br/>\ngames that her siblings so enjoyed, frustrated her beyond measure. She tried <br/>\nand tried and tried and still she couldn&#39;t get it. It was truly horrible for <br/>\na while when she was about five or six. Her twin, who she&#39;d been competing <br/>\nwith since they&#39;d been conceived, was learning to read without her! She would <br/>\ninsist on trying to read something, insist that I tell her when she made a <br/>\nmistake and then collapse into a screaming heap of frustration when I <br/>\ncorrected her, or cry in great gasping sobs when I didn&#39;t correct her because <br/>\nshe knew she wasn&#39;t getting it. She&#39;d pull out one of our homemade reading <br/>\ngames and beg everyone in the house to play with her, running away in tears <br/>\nafter a few minutes because she was unable to &quot;get it.&quot; After many many weeks <br/>\nof torture I finally took the drastic step of HIDING all the phonics and <br/>\nreading materials in the house. I hid the games and the magnetic letters, the <br/>\neasy reader books and the BOB books, our homemade letter strips and the tiles <br/>\nand every single book she could even begin to imagine she might be able to <br/>\nread. I stopped reading with her twin when she was around and I put the <br/>\ncomputer games out of her reach. (Then I went online and whined about it all. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;) <br/>\n<br/>\nI then set about gently persuading her that she simply wasn&#39;t ready yet to <br/>\nlearn to read, that she WOULD be ready someday and while we couldn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhen that would be that it wouldn&#39;t be forever, and that since she had skills <br/>\nand talents that her reading brother didn&#39;t have maybe they could share with <br/>\neach other instead of competing. It wasn&#39;t an easy sell. And let me tell you, <br/>\nif sheer will power could have done it she&#39;d have read earlier than any of my <br/>\nchildren because she is one stubbornly persistent child and by gum she <br/>\ndesired it more strongly than any of them. I researched and considered and <br/>\nworried and then decided that if she wasn&#39;t progressing at nine I&#39;d start <br/>\nlooking for outside help for her. I worried because almost all the stories <br/>\nI&#39;d heard about late readers were about kids who hadn&#39;t WANTED to read until <br/>\nthey got older, who learned to read when they decided they were ready. I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t ever read about a kid who was trying to read and not succeeding who <br/>\nlater learned to read without &quot;special education&quot;. And I&#39;d never heard of a <br/>\nkid coming through &quot;special education&quot; who liked to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo she wasn&#39;t reading at six and seven and eight and nine. She drew <br/>\nincreasingly fantastic scenes and labeled them with words she solicited from <br/>\nus, sometimes written in perfect mirror imaging from right to left. (Nope, <br/>\nshe&#39;s not the leftie. &lt;g&gt;) She sometimes sat for an hour or more looking <br/>\nthrough books, pretending to read. Not looking at pictures or recalling <br/>\npreviously read text, just playacting for herself that she was a grown up <br/>\nreader - her favorite book to &quot;read&quot; for over a year was a pocket Bible, <br/>\ndensely packed minuscule text printed on tissue thin vellum. She &quot;wrote&quot; long <br/>\nstories and kept a diary, all in long scribbles without so much as a single <br/>\nreal letter on the page. She went to the library once a week and brought home <br/>\nstacks of books about whatever topic she was currently fascinated by, usually <br/>\nsome animal species. She looked through every book by herself over and over <br/>\nand sometimes let me read them to her. She told people she loved reading, and <br/>\nnone of us pointed out that she wasn&#39;t reading. I tried not to worry that she <br/>\njust couldn&#39;t remember sounds. Every few months she asked for Lessons, and <br/>\nwe&#39;d work together on sound combinations a little bit (mostly playing games) <br/>\nseveral times a day for a week or so until the frustration grew again and <br/>\nshe&#39;d agree to wait some more. Always I watched (and worried a lot) to make <br/>\nsure I wasn&#39;t ignoring some real problem, that it truly was just a matter of <br/>\ntime till her brain grew enough connections to allow her to learn to read. <br/>\nMeanwhile she could read Mom, Dad, Sarah, Love, and very little else. She <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even read STOP signs!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt nine and a half she very suddenly started to &quot;get it&quot;. She was reading. <br/>\nShe was playing the games and usually getting it all right the first time. <br/>\nShe started reading fiction. The first book she read completely on her own <br/>\nwas agonizingly slow, half an hour or more per 3rd grade level page. She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care. She was SO happy to be finally reading. I couldn&#39;t believe that <br/>\nanyone could take that long to read so little and not be totally losing the <br/>\nsense of the story, but darned if she wasn&#39;t able to narrate the book in <br/>\ndetail after finishing it. At ten she is this week reading a book published <br/>\nfor adults (Raptor Red) with full comprehension, slowly, but her speed is <br/>\npicking up. Harry Potter is still elusive - he&#39;s come down off the shelf <br/>\nseveral times now for a try out and been put back each time with a sigh. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had more intensive and focused phonics instruction than any of my other <br/>\nchildren, and none of it was any use to her till her brain was ready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad she been in school she&#39;d have been remediated and tested and special <br/>\ngrouped for the last three years. It&#39;s unlikely she&#39;d have been able to keep <br/>\nthinking of herself as a reader long enough for her brain to catch up to her <br/>\ndesire. She would probably have learned to read about the same time, possibly <br/>\neven later, but she wouldn&#39;t have cared about it anymore. She&#39;d have been <br/>\nconvinced of her stupidity long before that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has gotten much longer than I intended when I started, and it&#39;s gotten <br/>\nvery late.

What I learned included the fact that carrying <br/>\nit out in schools is very very difficult and, really, too much to expect of <br/>\nmost teachers. I worked HARD to get my kids into classrooms with great <br/>\nteachers who were excited and energetic about it. But I couldn&#39;t sustain it - <br/>\nit was easier for ME to just get them out of school and live a &quot;whole life&quot; <br/>\nthan to manipulate the system so as to get them into really good whole <br/>\nlanguage programs every year. Plus - they didn&#39;t DO whole language/integrated <br/>\ncurriculum anymore in the later elementary school years or secondary schools, <br/>\nof course. AND, I read John Gatto and ALL those &quot;hidden lessons of compulsory <br/>\nschooling&quot; -- that I&#39;d tried so hard to deny even to myself  - were all layed <br/>\nbare before my eyes and I couldn&#39;t ignore them anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n---pamS<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113456839,"authorName":"Suzie & Wayne Woods","from":"Suzie & Wayne Woods &lt;suzie.wayne@...&gt;","profile":"woodsville200","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re; Phonics, Key to reading","postDate":"1027740321","msgId":39514,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNENDIxMkExLjQwNjA2MDVAY2xlYXIubmV0Lm56Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDNlLjIxYzg3MmExLjJhNzMxODI0QGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDIyMDFjMjM1MTEkMTA5MWM1MjAkMjdhNjU2MThAZWQuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":39513,"nextInTopic":39516,"prevInTime":39513,"nextInTime":39515,"topicId":39495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"debi watson wrote: Does New Zealand still recognize Sylvia Ashton-Warner and *her* contributions (ie, organic reading)?

(She did the bulk of her work in New Zealand and one disastrous stint in a Free School in the States).  I really liked her theories that children were often interested in sex and fear (a word like &quot;ambulance&quot; &quot;ghost&quot; &quot;knife&quot; or &quot;kiss&quot; was more likely to be important to them than &quot;bag&quot;, &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;sit&quot;) and that simply giving them *their* words (written for each child on a card every day based on conversations they had, and not contrived conversations to extrapolate the word SHE wanted them to have) would stimulate in them a desire for more.  If the child did not recognize the word later, she reasoned it was not a word they really wanted and moved on to something else.  She got really great results!  Also, phonics is only the decoding part of reading.  I have worked a lot with people of all ages (from toddlers to 80 year olds) who are learning English as a second language, and while their &quot;decoding&quot; skills are excellent (ie, they can sound out most words competently), they often have very little &quot;comprehension&quot;.  That&#39;s where guessing based on context comes in.  It is just as valuable as phonics, and both are needed to read fluently -- it&#39;s the whole &quot;connotative as well as denotative&quot; thing.  Just my humble contribution.  I am finding this whole thing really interesting!

It just is not necessary - we&#39;ve seen <br/>\nit over and over and over now - unschooled kids, raised in homes where <br/>\nlearning is inseperable from life and where books and other print materials <br/>\nare engaging and a constant presence, just learn to read. Parents are <br/>\nsometimes even astounded - one of mine learned really truly on her own <br/>\nwithout me even seeing any signs that she was doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not teach my kids to read. <br/>\nI helped them learn, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could (and have, ad nauseum) argued about whether helping someone learn is <br/>\nthe same as teaching --- the point here is that it is good to spend time <br/>\nthinking about the distinction since it helps clarify the difference between <br/>\nwhat is USUALLY thought of as teaching (adult decides what, when, how, and <br/>\nwhere a kid should learn and gives direct instruction to the kid and assesses <br/>\nwhether or how much the kid has learned) vs unschooling (kid decides what, <br/>\nwhen, how, and where to learn - or often just learns without even &quot;deciding&quot; <br/>\nto do so - adult is there to encourage, support, offer information, ideas, <br/>\nand resources).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, I could write almost the exact same thing about arithmetic.

It is wrong to say &quot;Whole Language&quot; as if it is an <br/>\nalternative to phonics instruction. Whole Language, as we experienced it <br/>\nfirst-hand (and I was VERY interested in how it was implemented and how well <br/>\nit worked and did a LOT of direct observation as well as lots of reading on <br/>\nthe subject) always included phonics information - especially in the form of <br/>\ngames, but also just in constant informal communication between kids and <br/>\nteachers and, in small amounts, in direct instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older two daughters went to school for a while. These are my two who <br/>\nlearned to read really really well BEFORE starting school (they were tested <br/>\nat high school reading level in first grade - whatever the heck that really <br/>\nmeans &lt;G&gt;), so they didn&#39;t learn to read there. But they were there and I was <br/>\nthere (a lot, as you can imagine).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were lucky that their schools were at that time very very much whole <br/>\nlanguage based and these were just absolutely marvelous stimulating <br/>\ninteresting alive classrooms - they were just filled to the brim with a <br/>\nb&#39;zillion different things - including wonderful gorgeous picture books, <br/>\nfantastic nonfiction books about animals, electrons, space, dinosaurs -- <br/>\nanything and everything, building materials, a whole corner set up with <br/>\nbeanbag chairs and tape players and headphones with books on tape and the <br/>\nbooks themselves. The walls were covered with beautiful posters. They had a <br/>\nmail area - where each kid had their own little mailbox and they had all <br/>\nkinds of lovely writing materials - pens and ink, markers, stickers, <br/>\nstationary, stamps and stamp pads, etc. They could write to kids in their own <br/>\nclassroom or any other kid or teacher or administrator in the school. There <br/>\nwas mail pickup and delivery once a day. They had a piano and other musical <br/>\ninstruments - they had lots of tape players and tapes. They had counters with <br/>\nlots of animals - and signs all around them telling interesting things about <br/>\nthem and printed instructions about their care. The kids took turns taking <br/>\nthem home - with the instructions. There were lots of games -- there were <br/>\nboxes of card games that involved words, there were traditional kids&#39; games <br/>\nlike Monopoly, etc., and there were special phonics games - phonics Bingo was <br/>\nvery popular. There were art supplies and there was gardening inside and <br/>\noutside - all these things had printed instructions and ideas and <br/>\ninformation. There was reading-aloud time, there was drama - kids put on <br/>\nshort plays. The kids made up games - board games, card games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese kids learned to read because there was huge motivation and interest. <br/>\nThey had very little required work - each child had a file folder in a box <br/>\nand the teacher would leave them notes, each day, about things they wanted <br/>\nthe child to choose to do, sometime throughout the day. Some would just be <br/>\nsuggestions - usually offered to get the child started - others would be <br/>\nactual times that the teacher was going to do something with the child - it <br/>\nmight say, &quot;Come play Bingo with me at 11:15,&quot; for example. They had a page <br/>\nin their file, for the week, that was a grid - different areas of the room <br/>\nlisted across the top and the days of the week down the left side. They would <br/>\ncolor in the square if they spent time in a certain area on a certain day. So <br/>\nif they spent time in the &quot;Writing Workshop Area&quot; on Tuesday - they&#39;d color <br/>\nin the square on the grid corresponding to that. The teacher also kept an eye <br/>\non what the kids were doing and had a page for each kid in a notebook and, <br/>\nthroughout the day, jotted down her observations on post-it notes that she <br/>\nstuck on her notebook and at the end of the day stuck onto each kids page for <br/>\nthat day. The kids grid and her postit notes were what she used to write the <br/>\nnarrative description of what the child had been working on and learning -  <br/>\nthat they used instead of any kind of grades or report cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids who didn&#39;t seem to be learning - the ones the teachers thought <br/>\nneeded more direct instruction - were given that more direct instruction - <br/>\nmostly by the teacher organizing groups of kids to play the more <br/>\nphonics-based games or singing the songs or whatever, togethe. In these <br/>\nclassrooms - about 5 percent of kids didn&#39;t seem to be able to &quot;catch&quot; <br/>\nreading by the time they were 9 or so. So they tried to identify who those <br/>\nkids were likely to be and give them more direct help. But why put ALL the <br/>\nkids through all that direct phonics instruction when they could be having <br/>\nFUN and reading great stuff and just learning?<br/>\n<br/>\nI took my kids out of school when one was 9 and one was 6 - my third never <br/>\nwent. But thank GOODNESS while they were there they had whole language - <br/>\nthey&#39;d have been bored out of their minds without that. Whole Language let <br/>\nthem mostly work at their own chosen levels - mostly on things they were <br/>\ninterested in - within the constraints of what was available in the school, <br/>\nof course.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re; Phonics, Key to reading","postDate":"1027712080","msgId":39497,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY1NnVQRFZuaVNuUk1XdUxuNVUwMDAxZWJhNUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39495,"nextInTopic":39499,"prevInTime":39496,"nextInTime":39498,"topicId":39495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Twenty years ago, I was not as confident about<br/>\nUNschooling as I am today, but I still have a long way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked pamS&#39;s post. I&#39;m happy for you that you &quot;played with words<br/>\nfor the fun of it.&quot; That&#39;s what I was trying to do with my kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it ain&#39;t fun, don&#39;t do it. However, people come to this egroup (and to<br/>\nLuz and me privately) with anxiety and confusion about how to get their kids<br/>\nto learn things they believe are important. The answers are not easy. Many<br/>\npeople, no matter what we say, still believe there are things that they need<br/>\nto teach their kids since they don&#39;t seem to know certain stuff, and the<br/>\nparents feel (naturally) responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was one of those people years ago. I believed that it was important for my<br/>\nkid to know the connection between letters and sounds -- a simple fact, but<br/>\nnot obvious to all. It was (is) also my conviction that public schools teach<br/>\nreading by the totally ridiculous and harmful nonsense known as &quot;Whole<br/>\nLanguage&quot; that creates exactly the wrong concept for learning to read, and<br/>\ncauses most of the &quot;learning disabilities&quot; that kids in those schools have.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my defense, I believe that parents teach their children, even when and if<br/>\nthey are trying their darnedest NOT to teach them. I wanted NOT to be my<br/>\nkid&#39;s teacher, but I wanted to be sure that he knew the principle behind the<br/>\nEnglish language -- phonics. What to do...?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experiment with teaching phonics -- using the regrigerator as a<br/>\nblackboard --  lasted about four days (in actual time, about 38 seconds<br/>\ntotal) and no more than twenty short words were ever put up before my kid<br/>\n(who already could read) asked me to stop messing with his head by thinking<br/>\nit was some sort of fun game for him because it insulted his intelligence.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat was enough. I quit doing it. He didn&#39;t like it. He didn&#39;t participate,<br/>\nbut it was because he already knew what I was doing. My failure was not<br/>\nknowing that he already knew the principles. I&#39;m still sorry twenty years<br/>\nlater :,&lt;(. Kids can KNOW principles without being taught them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s OK (or even important) for parents to know/learn phonics. But<br/>\ndon&#39;t teach it to your kids. Is it the same for horseback riding, or<br/>\nsailing?<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I getting it now?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo can we talk about not teaching/learning arithmetic? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  to Sandra who wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;Once a child is reading, it doesn&#39;t matter how he learned.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I say that is true only if s/he reads accurately. I&#39;ve listened to high<br/>\nschool graduates &quot;read,&quot; using their Whole Language &quot;training&quot; -- memorizing<br/>\n&quot;shapes of words&quot; and guessing instead of phonetic decoding, and it is<br/>\npainful to hear the mistakes caused by the inability to analyse words<br/>\nphonetically. Unless a person knows the connection between letters and<br/>\nsounds, they simply do not know how to read well.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, as you say, reading takes practice.
