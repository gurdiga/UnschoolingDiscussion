Not necessarily with all the kids, if they&#39;re old enough to <br/>\nstay home or be somewhere else.  And you can piggy-back the outings onto <br/>\ndeliveries, like if one kid has to be somewhere, plan to drop him off and take the <br/>\nothers somewhere else.  Doesn&#39;t have to be elaborate or expensive.  Maybe just <br/>\none errand, or to lunch, or to take the dog to run in some park or vacant lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest outing of all is to go to a different grocery store.  Take twenty <br/>\nminutes longer to shop, but see new things, new people, drive a different <br/>\nroute, take your time, talk to the kids, stop at some section you&#39;ve never stood <br/>\nin front of before and just LOOK at the stuff.  Use the grocery store as a <br/>\nmuseum.  Buy some vegetable you&#39;ve never had.  You can get recipes on the <br/>\ninternet with google.com.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will spark up some learning and break up your monotony.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have more time and money, maybe have an artsy lunch and hit a big <br/>\nmagazine rack to get some magazines you&#39;ve never heard of (or that you like but <br/>\ndon&#39;t usually buy).

It&#39;s been a few months for me, and I&#39;m <br/>\nstill feeling doubt about this, quite a bit of the time. Like Beth, I <br/>\nfeel like a bit of a dullard, like I don&#39;t have the interests or <br/>\npassions about life, to lead my kids this way in excellence. <br/>\nModeling &quot;computer&quot; and &quot;reading&quot; LOL that&#39;s what I seem to be doing. <br/>\nGetting off my duff once in a blue moon to take care of the barest <br/>\nminimum of housekeeping and the house DOES look it, believe me. <br/>\nDepressing. <br/>\n<br/>\nalthough, with company coming over on Friday, we will be getting busy <br/>\nwith housework today and tomorrow, so that&#39;ll be better, the house <br/>\npart of things. I just have such a lethargy about everything. Like, <br/>\ngiving my kids permission to do what they want, has led to me doing <br/>\nONLY what I &quot;want&quot; and not any of my duties or responsibilities, and <br/>\nthe house (and yard, btw) look it. No energy. Lots of apathy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can&#39;t be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I must say I&#39;m seeing some good things from my kids. We have <br/>\na broken leg in the house, which means the TV is not only on a lot, <br/>\nbut upstairs, and...actually gets turned off and stays off, for a <br/>\nlarge portion of every day. This is not something I expected: by <br/>\nchoice, the kids, even the kid on her back on the couch, opting OUT <br/>\nof the TV watching. wow. But youse told me, they would eventually. It <br/>\ncould very well be, the TV (and maybe even the computer games) will <br/>\nbecome &quot;just another thing to do&quot; around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, Katie whose leg it is that is broken...playing cribbage <br/>\nyesterday, was doing some pretty cool math. For instance, when her <br/>\npoints added up to an even number, she was breaking it down into two <br/>\nmoves. e.g. 18 points, she&#39;d move her piece and count 9, and then <br/>\ncount 9 again. Who taught her that? Not I. She is full of little math <br/>\nsurprises like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, Abbie my 15 year old, signed off of chat, and then sat in <br/>\na chair shaking her head and saying &quot;I&#39;ve got to do something about <br/>\nthis chat addiction&quot; *eyebrows up* You mean, I didn&#39;t need to SAY <br/>\nTHAT to her? She figured it out on HER OWN? wow<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Robby&#39;s willingness to pitch in has increased. Eye contact, too. <br/>\nRobby, the one who&#39;s been &quot;schooled&quot; the most, whom I have worried <br/>\nabout the most, is turning off the computer games voluntarily, is <br/>\ntalking to me excitedly about things (including his latest level in <br/>\nhis latest puter game!), is making eye contact, is saying &quot;okay&quot; <br/>\nwithout a whine or complaint when asked to feed the chickens or <br/>\nwhatever...*sniff* *dab* I think our relationship is getting good <br/>\nagain *dab*<br/>\n<br/>\nso it isn&#39;t the kids I&#39;m worried about anymore...it&#39;s me.
