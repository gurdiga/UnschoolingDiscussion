I&#39;m a homeschooler/unschooler (or learning to be<br/>\n&gt; one), have 3 boys 7, 3, and 3 months, and live in Escanaba MI. We&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling for about 2 years, and my son has been gradually leading me<br/>\n&gt; into unschooling, which is the best method for him to learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m addressing your question, Tracy, because I just went through this with<br/>\n&gt; my husband, Mike.  He&#39;s naturally a coercive parent. He does his best to<br/>\n&gt; control it, but his childhood upbringing was based on authority and fear,<br/>\n&gt; and he regresses.  We&#39;ve done a good job treating our kids like people and<br/>\n&gt; not pets, so they are personality plus-especially our eldest boy. As a<br/>\n&gt; result, Mike butts heads with our son, Seamus, rather often.  He&#39;s proud<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; Seamus&#39; spirit, but frustrated that Seamus hasn&#39;t yet figured out how to<br/>\n&gt; pick his battles. I admit, I get frustrated too, but I&#39;m more patient than<br/>\n&gt; my husband.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve had the same problems over house upkeep. We all live in this house<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; avail of the advantages of living here, so I feel we all need to work<br/>\n&gt; together in order to &quot;pay&quot; for the &quot;privilege&quot; of living in our home. I<br/>\n&gt; explained it to my son by using the Little Red Hen story. It seemed to<br/>\nclick<br/>\n&gt; well in his brain, but his lack of helping didn&#39;t change-and I ended up<br/>\n&gt; witnessing my husband coercing my son again to clean the house.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In order to keep peace in the house, we had to create non-coercive, or at<br/>\n&gt; least minimally coercive, consequences for my son.  Since we consider<br/>\nliving<br/>\n&gt; in our home a privilege, we decided to make a list of Seamus&#39; favorite<br/>\n&gt; privileges.  We wrote them out on tickets and tacked them to our bulletin<br/>\n&gt; board. When we find ourselves repeatedly requesting that he perform a<br/>\n&gt; household duty and he fails to do it he loses a daily privilege-like<br/>\n&gt; watching t.v., playing with his sega, using the computer, staying up until<br/>\n&gt; 9:30pm, getting dessert after dinner, and the absolute worst one we pull<br/>\n&gt; last, playing outside. (This last one is the biggie-he knows he&#39;ll really<br/>\n&gt; have screwed up if we have to pull that one as it&#39;s his favorite thing to<br/>\n&gt; do.  The good thing is-we haven&#39;t had to pull it yet). I can usually tell<br/>\n&gt; when it&#39;s time to take a ticket because I can feel my frustration level<br/>\n&gt; increase-I have no set number of requests since every situation is<br/>\nslightly<br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We also use the reward system, based on an idea I saw listed on another<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling board.  When he performs each daily duty without being<br/>\nforced<br/>\n&gt; to do it, he gets a star on his learning calendar.

Our son is learning that<br/>\n&gt; there are expectations that need to be followed when you share your home<br/>\n&gt; with others, and my husband is learning that children don&#39;t have to be<br/>\n&gt; threatened with ultimatums in order to get them to clean up after<br/>\n&gt; themselves. Most importantly, we&#39;ve learned how to talk with one another<br/>\n&gt; about doing household chores without getting frustrated or angry. And our<br/>\n&gt; home is staying clean without buildup for the first time since we&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; kids.  It&#39;s amazing! I guess some people (like me!) are just slow. ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway-that&#39;s an idea-something to chew on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best, Lee (Jennifer Lee Welch)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963933280/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963933280/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"dI2j9l9oVmBqd0m1E4pp0pSsE0wyEUbmJa72sBZWz6tkBH-hh58K0pYYsdrqnuLmo8iGBJWKeLL7w5xf7SSXH1EYIgEJ3JAyboKAijKeKKxWGx4k-Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] fed-up...","postDate":"963941444","msgId":11309,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NzRBMjU0LjE1MzI4LjFBREI1N0VAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFBpbmUuQlNGLjQuMDUuMTAwMDcxODEwMTAwNjAuMTIyMjctMTAwMDAwQG1hdGUua2pzbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM5NzQ2RjA3LjcwNjMuRTU0OEIzQGxvY2FsaG9zdD4="},"prevInTopic":11308,"nextInTopic":11314,"prevInTime":11308,"nextInTime":11310,"topicId":11279,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not sure whether to just get rid of everything and start again, with whatever they ask for, which just doesn t seem unschool-y to me, but someone else s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-581293220\">I&#39;m not sure whether to just get rid of everything and start again, <br/>\nwith whatever they ask for, which just doesn&#39;t seem unschool-y to <br/>\nme, but someone else&#39;s kid&#39;s psych has recommended for them <br/>\n(though her kids have separate rooms, so she can do that for one <br/>\nkid and not the other...)

My first born (a girl) has been a little helper since 4. <br/>\n Putting<br/>\naway clothes, helping picking up just to get things done so we can get onto <br/>\nthe<br/>\nmore important/fun things. My now 5 yr old boy does not like to clean up, he<br/>\nmostly hates it.  We  have had many talks on the subject.<br/>\nHow mom picks up stuff thats not even hers just to help out blah blah blah, it<br/>\ndoes seem to help a bit, but its frustrating cus his attitude makes me have <br/>\nnegative feelings towards him (ie I think he is lazy!) when in fact, he&#39;s <br/>\nreally just not that<br/>\nmature, cus sure cleaning up is not really fun compared to other things.  My <br/>\ncurrent three yr old boy will help out when we all get together to do it, but <br/>\nthen again sometimes he&#39;ll just do legos while the rest of us do it.  It <br/>\nseems that most of the moms I know have lowered their standards, but even <br/>\nstill we all seem to struggle with it. Picking up seems to be the most <br/>\ndreaded chore, while getting to clean (rags and spray bottles) isn&#39;t so bad.  <br/>\nI regularly go thru the kids room (and they know I am doing it and are right <br/>\nthere and know I don&#39;t take anything out that they want, they even check my <br/>\nbag and the stuff gets donated or goes in the trash.  At that age and older I <br/>\nwould say you still have to help them clean up.  You can&#39;t just say please <br/>\npick up your toys so I can vacuum, you will have to go in there sit on the <br/>\nfloor and hand each child a toy to set on the shelf, tell them each and every <br/>\npiece to pick up and where to put it.  Tedious yet, but less frustrating than <br/>\nexpecting them to do more than they are capable of.  On a final upbeat note <br/>\nLOL I gave the kids old dad socks to put on their feet and squirt bottles <br/>\nwith water and a dab of cleaner and told them to go ice skating on the <br/>\nkitchen floor.

DD on the other hand is &quot;I will but I will do<br/>\nit on my own time&quot; type. This has been hard for me to<br/>\ndeal with. What I have realized though is that DS is<br/>\nsomewhat of an exception and that maybe my<br/>\nexpectations are too high for DD. I have also decided<br/>\nthat I am not going to pick up after their messes in<br/>\nthe house. I will sweep everything into a pile and<br/>\neven go through and sort the pile into smaller piles<br/>\nso it doesn&#39;t seem so overwhelming to them but as far<br/>\nas actually putting the mess away, they do it.<br/>\nSometimes they dilly dally and take much longer than<br/>\nit has to. During these times I have learned that<br/>\nalthough they are doing the job much slower than I<br/>\nwould like for them too, they are still working on it.<br/>\nAlso, I have started telling them which pile each one<br/>\nhas to put away. Usually, DS ends up doing a little<br/>\nmore than DD, but I figure that he is older and can<br/>\nhandle a little more than she can. This has worked out<br/>\nso far. Now when it comes to cleaning DD&#39;s room I have<br/>\nfound that if I use the same technique she does pretty<br/>\nwell. Especially if I appear to be working i.e. busy<br/>\nin there with her. What I usually do is sweep<br/>\neverything into a pile and begin sortin it out. While<br/>\nI am doing this I will give her little jobs to do like<br/>\nI will say, &quot;Here go put this in your brother&#39;s room.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Go put this in the sink.&quot; So she is not just sitting<br/>\nthere while I am working. When she returns from each<br/>\nassignment I tell her thank you or good job/girl and<br/>\nthen give her something else to go do. In the end she<br/>\nputs most of the stuff away. I make sure not to show<br/>\nthat I am frustrated with her and give her lots of<br/>\npraise. This was really hard at first, but has really<br/>\npaid off. She still isn&#39;t able to go in there and do<br/>\nthe job herself but it isn&#39;t as unpleasant for either<br/>\nof us any more. Eventually, I will send her in to pick<br/>\nup just the clothes then pick up just the books, etc.<br/>\nThis is what I do with 5yos. Also, I will set the<br/>\ntimer for say 30 min and tell them &quot;Let&#39;s see if we<br/>\ncan beat the clock.&quot; They get excited and start<br/>\nrunning around. If they are done before the clock or<br/>\nif they have been working really hard and don&#39;t quite<br/>\nbeat the clock I will give them a treat for their hard<br/>\nwork. I know you wanted to hear that there was some<br/>\nway to get them to do it all at once right now, but I<br/>\nhave learned that many times they have to work<br/>\nthemselves up to doing the bigger job right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!

I&#39;m asking here because i<br/>\n&gt;really need some feedback on the whole emotional/empathetic/<br/>\n&gt;behavioural thing (basically I&#39;m looking for words of wisdom from<br/>\n&gt;Susan &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s Tuesday morning and once again I&#39;m mega-fed-up with the<br/>\n&gt;whole tidying-up thing.  I don&#39;t know, what do you all think?  I need<br/>\n&gt;to have one day a week when I get the whole house done.  If this<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t happen, it gets overwhelming and it doesn&#39;t get done for<br/>\n&gt;weeks and weeks.  This includes the kids&#39; room.  So is tidying<br/>\n&gt;their room their problem, since it&#39;s their room, or mine, since I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;the one who wants to vac the floor?  It doesn&#39;t help that I got fed-up<br/>\n&gt;of them faffing about on a Tuesday morning so now they do it on<br/>\n&gt;Monday night, and then my Tai Chi class moves from Thurs to Mon<br/>\n&gt;so dh has the kids, and at the moment there seems a lot of<br/>\n&gt;negativity from that corner.  Last night he told them that the tidying<br/>\n&gt;up would be done before they played out, (in ultimatum format...)<br/>\n&gt;so Heather said &#39;I&#39;ve changed my mind, I don&#39;t want to play out...&#39;  I<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t change how he is with them, but I can change how I am, and<br/>\n&gt;something needs to give...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Am I expecting too much of a 4&1/2 and 3&1/2yo, ther are capable<br/>\n&gt;of doing the tidying up, apart from the books, which either me or dh<br/>\n&gt;do?  The other problem is that when dh has the kids, he usually<br/>\n&gt;has work to do (like last night,) so they do their thing while he does<br/>\n&gt;his, or he wants peace and quiet to watch tv...  Can you tell it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt;the kids I&#39;m annoyed with???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t think this is off-topic, cause I don&#39;t see how we can all live<br/>\n&gt;together (which is surely what home-ed is about) unless we can<br/>\n&gt;manage these situations well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, I need to go finish that hoovering...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tracy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nmN4ZBtXyFe9FrQilWM0IMoj5W3arefm6EwF2XRdVC5yDDuvmErx2tCMFCJ16jAzoAtM8o8xK3UT","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] fed-up...","postDate":"963928542","msgId":11289,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUyLjc0NTE1YWUuMjZhNWJiZGVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11288,"nextInTopic":11290,"prevInTime":11288,"nextInTime":11290,"topicId":11279,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 07/18/2000 12:32:26 PM !!!First Boot!!!, tracy.oldfield@ntlworld.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1392221371\">In a message dated 07/18/2000 12:32:26 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; That would be good, the schools break up this week so I could <br/>\n have some help for the summer, but that&#39;s kind-of not the point,  <br/>\n what I&#39;m wondering is whether I should be insisting that they do <br/>\n their own room or not.

We (me) are in the midst of painting <br/>\nthe 2 kids&#39; rooms.  Yesterday, we got to my daughter&#39;s closet.  I do not even <br/>\npretend to intend to paint the inside.  But some of the clutter had to go in <br/>\norder to just fix the doors and paint the outside and move the bed, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI now have, in the garage, 4 large trash bags of stuffed animals and assorted <br/>\njunk.  These are from her closet and general floor stuff.  They are headed <br/>\nfor the trash!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe still has a fullllllllll toy box, fullllll to overflowing stuffed animal <br/>\nchest, lots and lots of art supplies (in a new lidded box to keep them in, I <br/>\nhope) and misc stuff around the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s room -- we took down a lot of things off the walls and I&#39;m not in <br/>\nany hurry to put them back.  We got rid of (threw away -- my opinion-- yard <br/>\nsales are nice for other people but I do not have the time or space to save <br/>\nstuff for a yard sales I will never have) blocks (the broken ones) and misc <br/>\njunk from the floor and under the bed and the closet.  This was only about 3 <br/>\ntrash bags of stuff thrown away!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rooms now are less visually cluttered (not even done in daughter&#39;s room <br/>\nyet) and feel cleaner and more user friendly.  And I think I notice, with <br/>\nless to keep picked up and a cleaner, new environment, that both are <br/>\nactually, I think, picking up a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to be so long-winded.

I&#39;m asking here because i<br/>\n&gt; really need some feedback on the whole emotional/empathetic/<br/>\n&gt; behavioural thing (basically I&#39;m looking for words of wisdom from<br/>\n&gt; Susan &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s Tuesday morning and once again I&#39;m mega-fed-up with the<br/>\n&gt; whole tidying-up thing.  I don&#39;t know, what do you all think?  I need<br/>\n&gt; to have one day a week when I get the whole house done.  If this<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t happen, it gets overwhelming and it doesn&#39;t get done for<br/>\n&gt; weeks and weeks.  This includes the kids&#39; room.  So is tidying<br/>\n&gt; their room their problem, since it&#39;s their room, or mine, since I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; the one who wants to vac the floor?  It doesn&#39;t help that I got fed-up<br/>\n&gt; of them faffing about on a Tuesday morning so now they do it on<br/>\n&gt; Monday night, and then my Tai Chi class moves from Thurs to Mon<br/>\n&gt; so dh has the kids, and at the moment there seems a lot of<br/>\n&gt; negativity from that corner.  Last night he told them that the tidying<br/>\n&gt; up would be done before they played out, (in ultimatum format...)<br/>\n&gt; so Heather said &#39;I&#39;ve changed my mind, I don&#39;t want to play out...&#39;  I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t change how he is with them, but I can change how I am, and<br/>\n&gt; something needs to give...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I expecting too much of a 4&1/2 and 3&1/2yo, ther are capable<br/>\n&gt; of doing the tidying up, apart from the books, which either me or dh<br/>\n&gt; do?  The other problem is that when dh has the kids, he usually<br/>\n&gt; has work to do (like last night,) so they do their thing while he does<br/>\n&gt; his, or he wants peace and quiet to watch tv...  Can you tell it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; the kids I&#39;m annoyed with???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think this is off-topic, cause I don&#39;t see how we can all live<br/>\n&gt; together (which is surely what home-ed is about) unless we can<br/>\n&gt; manage these situations well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, I need to go finish that hoovering...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963917375/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963917375/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11343,"nextTopicId":11344}}
