She went to ONE <br/>\nday of Vacation Bible School this summer and decided that she would rather <br/>\nDIE than go to school.  They treated her requests in usual &quot;kids don&#39;t really <br/>\nknow what they want&quot; fashion and she had to do what everyone else was doing <br/>\neven though she was interested in something different.  She summed it all up <br/>\nvery well when she said, &quot;They tell you that you have to stop learning THAT <br/>\nthing because now it&#39;s time to learn THIS thing.  That&#39;s it, no more <br/>\nlearning!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me laugh but she sure nailed it on the head.  It was a God-send <br/>\nbecause she is on FIRE to learn now.
