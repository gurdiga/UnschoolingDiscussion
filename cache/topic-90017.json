Groups Members,<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to a recent outbreak of computer viruses being transmitted via <br/>\nemail messages, Yahoo! Groups is experiencing delays in delivering <br/>\ngroup messages. To improve performance, and to help reduce the spread <br/>\nof viruses, Yahoo! Groups has had to temporarily reject some <br/>\nmessages. <br/>\n<br/>\nBased on an advisory posted by a leading anti-virus company, Groups <br/>\nwill temporarily reject messages with the following subject lines: <br/>\n<br/>\ntest <br/>\nhi <br/>\nhello <br/>\nMail Delivery System <br/>\nMail Transaction Failed <br/>\nServer Report <br/>\nStatus <br/>\nError <br/>\nIf you have attempted to post a message to Yahoo! Groups and have <br/>\nreceived a rejection notice with a link to this page, your computer <br/>\nmay have been infected. If you are confident that your computer is <br/>\nnot infected but your message was rejected, please try posting a new <br/>\nmessage with a subject line which is different than those listed <br/>\nabove.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can assure you that this is only a temporary measure and hope to <br/>\nrestore message delivery to normal as soon as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Yahoo! Groups Team</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90007,"nextTopicId":3487}}
