I have read it but I found Grace Lewellyn&#39;s <br/>\nTeenage Liberation Handbook to be much more empowering and freeing.  Even if <br/>\nyour kiddies are younger now, it is a good read for Mom&#39;s who often freak out <br/>\nabout the unschooling thing.  My guys are 11 and 12 and they are reading the <br/>\nbook this year themselves.  How else are they going to get Mom off their <br/>\nback?  &lt;BG&gt;  I think they will finally have a sense of control over their own <br/>\ndestinies after reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Grace&#39;s book is great for Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s who are having a tough time <br/>\nunschooling/deschooling themselves.  I was able to take a deep breathe and <br/>\nrelax after reading it.  My kids are happier now too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12330,"nextTopicId":12341}}
