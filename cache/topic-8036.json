I HOOTED loudly and would&#39;ve spewed if <br/>\nI&#39;d been drinking anything, and then realized she was born in the 1980&#39;s and <br/>\nby then Tolkien&#39;s universe had spawned hundreds or thousands of copycat <br/>\nbooks, games, movies, cartoons, etc. and sure enough, it had been so <br/>\nthoroughly mined for a dozen years before my friend ever hit the planet, that <br/>\nthere was not a speck of that series that was news to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was apologizing even before I could take another breath, because I realized <br/>\nthat from her point of view it was not only longer than she needed to read to <br/>\ncome to things that others had told more recently, less tediously, etc., but <br/>\nthat taken out of its own temporal and social context, it just wasn&#39;t as big <br/>\na thrill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, it *was* the thing to be reading, <br/>\nand although it wasn&#39;t designed to do so it aided the cross-cultural social <br/>\nengineering going on among young people at the time.  Steeped in visions of <br/>\ncooperation between different kinds of beings, and identifying the evil <br/>\npoliticians with the hoard-guarding, smoke-breathing bad guys... well it was <br/>\na balm on the already-unfolding socio-political business of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Tolkien was a linguist and loved English folklore, and so for those of <br/>\nus interested in fairy tales and ballads, there were elements visible, and <br/>\nthe naming of the elves vs. the orcs and others was a model (a charicature, <br/>\nbut with legitimate bases) of western Indo-European linguistic differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those of us who had been being made to read too much 18th and 19th <br/>\ncentury literature, it was nice to read a full-out fantasy which was also so <br/>\nbeautifully composed.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t blame kids today if they&#39;d rather see the movie than read the book.  <br/>\nI won&#39;t say a word of shame.  It&#39;s hard going, those books.  But there are <br/>\npassages that make me catch my breath.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn elf rider is scoffing at the idea of &quot;halflings&quot; (hobbits, in this story, <br/>\nbut halflings in English before that) and says to Gimli and Aragorn/Strider:  <br/>\n&quot;Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A man may do both,&quot; said Aragorn, &quot;For not we but those who come after will <br/>\nmake the legends of our time.  The green earth, say you?  That is a mighty <br/>\nmatter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s another passage I was going to look for, hobbits going done a river <br/>\nin a canyon, with a stunning description, but I already got sucked into the <br/>\nbook again and I have things to do when kids wake up, so must go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cZrWu_7zOuWWQD93kpwO2qCbYvceapO4VTdxTpEYIfwFuOtJWoh6nsOlRlSkZPOT5347YWze0AX1ZvN8Y8NioF5sCUa8RAIdWvuGUgjgG4ahQOABbA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Lord of the Rings","postDate":"985860017","msgId":17379,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBQzMxNUMxLjE5NjIzLjIyRkMzQUBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxLjk3OTRkMTcuMjdmM2M5ZGRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":17340,"nextInTopic":18676,"prevInTime":17378,"nextInTime":17380,"topicId":8036,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Since Lord of the Rings has been mentioned several times lately, I thought \u000f I d ask....does anyone know of good illustrated editions of these books?
