We don t really talk about what they want to be when they grow up .","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-951011935\">Dallen, my 9 yo, said something in the car the other day that I thought was <br/>\nwonderful.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t really talk about what they &quot;want to be&quot; when they &quot;grow up&quot;.  I <br/>\nhate that phrase but they are sometimes asked that by well meaning people.  And <br/>\nthey are happy to discuss their interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway we were in the car and Dallen said &quot;Mom...I thought my passion was <br/>\nmaking the perfect computer game or creating the perfect artificial intelligence <br/>\nbut really I believe my passion is with genetics.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved the way he put it.  He has always been fascinated with genetics and <br/>\nloves to read everything he can about it.  He collects DNA.  Like hair samples <br/>\netc and puts them in baggies and labels them as to where he got them and what <br/>\nit was from etc.  He talks with people at different science centers and all.  <br/>\nI just loved the way he put it.  Not &quot;when I grow up I want to work in <br/>\ngenetics&quot;.  It was about finding his passion.  Like he is sampling everything. And it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t about time.  Like &quot;when I grow up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess he has heard me say a time or two that quilting is my passion.  I <br/>\nlove to craft but quilting is a passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84226,"nextTopicId":84245}}
