But he persisted, so I told him...he started to read at <br/>\nthe age <br/>\n&gt; of 4.  He was writing and telling me his letters and numbers by the <br/>\ntime he <br/>\n&gt; was 2. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Caroline,<br/>\n<br/>\nI can very much relate to what you wrote.  My daughter could write <br/>\nher name at 2 1/2, which I thought was because her name is Emma and <br/>\neasy to write.  However, over the next few months she could write the <br/>\nwhole alphabet and write simple words. Reading soon followed and by 4 <br/>\nshe was a fluent reader.  People ask me those questions too, about <br/>\nwhen she learned to read, what she&#39;s reading, or worse, they ask her <br/>\nwhat she&#39;s reading and don&#39;t believe her.  Then they want to know how <br/>\nI taught her to read so young and I try (unsucessfully) to say I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do anything.  It was all Emma&#39;s work.  From the time she was 2 <br/>\n1/2 until she was 4 she was determined and tenacious.  She wanted to <br/>\nmake the connection between the words I was reading to her and the <br/>\nletters that made up those words.  She practiced for hours writing.  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t drill her, it was what she wanted to do.  When I read out <br/>\nloud to her she stopped me all the time to ask about the words, <br/>\nwhat&#39;s this word, where&#39;s that word.  I always stopped to tell her.  <br/>\nThere are people who dont pay attention to what their children are <br/>\nlearning and would consider a question during a story very rude, but <br/>\nmy thinking was the more questions the more learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nHer Kindergarten teacher made her the &quot;class helper&quot; which created <br/>\nconflict with some of the other kids.  When they were writing Emma <br/>\nwould go around and show the kids the &quot;proper&quot; way to write.  This is <br/>\nwhat the teacher wanted her to do.  She thought it helped everyone, <br/>\nbut it just made some of the children resentful of Emma.  Emma didn&#39;t <br/>\ncare, she loved being the teacher and to this day is a boss hog, <br/>\nlol.  I&#39;m laughing in jest, because it now causes conflict at home <br/>\nwhere I operated a home day care.  I have to explain that the <br/>\nchildren are learning through practicing and getting it wrong and she <br/>\ndid the same thing.  In school they do not let children do that and <br/>\nEmma spent a whole school year correcting children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can sure relate to what you are going through and hope to hear more <br/>\nfrom you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Stupid question","postDate":"1023812492","msgId":38286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDYxMTA5MTgyMi4wMjgzNjY0MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMjA2MTAxODE4MTQuMDQyZTE4ZDBAbWFpbC5lYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjM3NDY4NzAuMTIxMi41MjIyMy5tMUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38281,"nextInTopic":38299,"prevInTime":38285,"nextInTime":38287,"topicId":38237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My daughter started to read at about 3 1/2 and she reads very well - and most anything she gets her hands on. Most people feel I am doing this fabulous job homeschooling her - because she is &quot;excelling&quot; - However, my little ones 3, &4 have absolutey on interest in reading - other than being read to. This is fine with me. Although I do sometimes wonder if her early reading had a lot to do with the fact that it was just her in the beginning. My husband used to work 2nd shift and in the morning they would do puzzles and read together all the time - because that was what she wanted to do. Her favorite puzzle was the alphabet puzzle. The other two don&#39;t touch it with a ten foot pole! They play all kinds of things together - digging in the dirt, etc. yet it&#39;s my older daughter that always wants to read with me - or go to the library.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just started unschooling this past December - and I am still unsure of myself. Reading here helps quite a bit - especially when I tend to stress about the days when we all seem to not &quot;do&quot; much. And sometimes it takes listening to everyone else describe different aspects of unschooling, and I will think - Hey we worked in the garden - that&#39;s science. We tried to find and catch frogs...or made cookies ( those fractions!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, Welcome - I am sure you will find some useful posts here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Caroline <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 10, 2002 5:38 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Stupid question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi guys...I&#39;m relatively new here and have been reading most of the posts <br/>\n  coming through (I say most because you guys post a whole lot and I don&#39;t <br/>\n  have time to read it all lol).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, I wanted to make a little remark about the whole math/life <br/>\n  thing.  I agree completely that math is one of the most confusing things to <br/>\n  realize that you actually are teaching, but one of the easiest things to <br/>\n  teach!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have been homeschooling my son for about two years now.  He just turned <br/>\n  9.  We are pretty much unschoolers, unless he goes to his grandparents <br/>\n  where they request that I send school work, which he is just fine with!  He <br/>\n  thinks it is kind of fun to do with his grandma, so I send stuff they can <br/>\n  do together.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, just to share a little story:<br/>\n<br/>\n  We were at our Friday night open gym at the gymnastics place when my son <br/>\n  came running up to me and asked, &quot;Mom, do I know fractions?&quot;  I told him <br/>\n  yes, fractions are like the 1/4, 1/2 stuff we always mess around with.  He <br/>\n  was satisfied with that answer and ran back off again to play.  Later on I <br/>\n  asked him why he asked me that.  He told me that one of the little girls <br/>\n  that was there had learned he was homeschooled and was trying to figure out <br/>\n  if he learned the same kinds of things she did in school.  I personally <br/>\n  thought that was quite comical!  Especially when my son is always asking to <br/>\n  learn stuff about math.  He started asking me about multiplication when he <br/>\n  was about 6...then wanted to learn division right away.  So we talked about <br/>\n  it, worked out a few little problems, and he just keeps plugging away at <br/>\n  asking his questions.  He has no idea how much he actually knows and this <br/>\n  question really struck me funny, because even in our conversations of how <br/>\n  things work, he now knows how to add fractions, so I know he is figuring <br/>\n  something out here!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I also wanted to say that I too have a great challenge in getting my family <br/>\n  to understand why I am homeschooling and that I plan on doing this until <br/>\n  the end!  My mother is a Kindergarten teacher, and insists that when he <br/>\n  gets to middle school I will have to send him back to school.  I tell her <br/>\n  &quot;whatever&quot; my most favoritist word.  LOL  The thing is, I honestly don&#39;t <br/>\n  know what grade my son is in.  He works at all different levels at <br/>\n  different things, as he likes.  People don&#39;t really get that and always ask <br/>\n  &quot;what grade is he in&quot;.

Presently is reading <br/>\n  The Hobbit, cause I told him he couldn&#39;t read The Lord of the Rings until <br/>\n  he read The Hobbit! LOL  He is on his computer all the time, programming, <br/>\n  making games, playing games, whatever.  His passion is to make a new, <br/>\n  unique video game, one that Nintendo or Sony will buy for the game <br/>\n  systems...or both!! lol  So I let him!  It really is funny how people don&#39;t <br/>\n  understand the concept of unschooling at all...sometimes very frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Although, okay, here is another story.  I have another friend who unschools <br/>\n  as well, and being that all of us unschoolers do it differently and all of <br/>\n  our kids learn at different ages, he started talking about how his 10 year <br/>\n  old boy had just learned how to read on his own and how proud he was of him <br/>\n  for that!  He was delighted that he had read a book all the way through the <br/>\n  previous night, some Mrs. Piggly Wiggly book or something that I wasn&#39;t <br/>\n  familiar with.  Well, he then turns and asks me when Ronnie learned to <br/>\n  read.  I really didn&#39;t want to tell him because I didn&#39;t want to make him <br/>\n  feel bad.

Ugh...not a <br/>\n  question I wanted to answer either!  He was in the midst of reading Mary <br/>\n  Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein.  The man just kind of looked at me as if I had <br/>\n  three heads and said &quot;OH!&quot; That was the end of THAT conversation! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, that is my story, and I&#39;m sticking to it!  My son and I live in SW <br/>\n  Florida.  My husband was killed in an accident almost three years ago, so <br/>\n  it is just the two of us.  WE have a ton of family here, so we have a lot <br/>\n  of support and love.

Because real life math is about<br/>\ndiscovering how numbers work rather than memorizing formulas to impose on<br/>\nnumbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal life math is, as an example, casually encountering percentages in a<br/>\ndozen different contexts and therefore slowly building up an idea of what<br/>\npercentages are and how they&#39;re used.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s similar to the process of how we acquire new words. Usually when we&#39;re<br/>\nreading or listening to conversations we don&#39;t run and get the dictionary to<br/>\nlook up a word we don&#39;t know. Generally we can get a good enough idea of its<br/>\nmeaning from the context. And the next time we encounter it we add another<br/>\nfacet to our understanding and the fuzzy impression of what the word means<br/>\ngets a bit more clear. And so on. The process probably accounts for our<br/>\noften not being able to define a word for someone else that we&#39;ve not only<br/>\nread and heard dozens of times but even used.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason people think multiplication and division are such difficult<br/>\nsubjects that, after algebra, that&#39;s the one thing they question under &quot;how<br/>\nwill they learn?&quot; But once a child realizes that multiplication is just a<br/>\nfast way to do repeated addition and that division is just a fast way to do<br/>\nrepeated subtraction, a great deal of what causes math phobia in adults<br/>\ndisappears. Multiplication and division aren&#39;t mysterious at all. They&#39;re<br/>\njust computation short cuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve found helpful is expressing things in a couple of different<br/>\nways. When we&#39;ve come across percents, I&#39;ve said &quot;17% or 17 out of every<br/>\n100,&quot; or &quot;25% is the same as a quarter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is solving problems out loud without pencil and paper so they<br/>\ncan see how numbers can be manipulated. So for instance to add 138 + 53.<br/>\n(Hmm, a bit tougher than I normally pull off the top of my head! ;-) but<br/>\nkids *do* pick up on the process when they hear similar processes dozens of<br/>\ntimes.) 39 is almost 40 and 53 is almost 50. 40+50 is 90. But we added 2 to<br/>\nthe 38 so we need to take away 2 from 90. And we subtracted 3 from the 53 so<br/>\nwe need to add 3. That brings us up to 91. Then just add 100.

Holly asked<br/>\n&gt; what prime numbers were.  <br/>\n&gt; (That was listed as a fourth grade thing.)  I showed<br/>\n&gt; her the first few, and <br/>\n&gt; she said &quot;Don&#39;t show me any more, I want to figure<br/>\n&gt; it out myself.&quot;   So she <br/>\n&gt; went off and was going through the numbers finding<br/>\n&gt; more primes.  She came and <br/>\n&gt; asked me questions after a while, twice, and then<br/>\n&gt; went back to it.

Holly asked what prime numbers were.  <br/>\n(That was listed as a fourth grade thing.)  I showed her the first few, and <br/>\nshe said &quot;Don&#39;t show me any more, I want to figure it out myself.&quot;   So she <br/>\nwent off and was going through the numbers finding more primes.  She came and <br/>\nasked me questions after a while, twice, and then went back to it.  She&#39;ll <br/>\nthink of it off and on for the rest of her life.  There&#39;s not going to be a <br/>\ntest, or a report.
