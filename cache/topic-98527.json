Nor did I walk down a crowded aisle of an auditorium to accept <br/>\nmy<br/>\ndiploma from a school official. Instead, I came home from my last<br/>\njoint-enrollment class at Georgia Perimeter College, walked up to my <br/>\nmom,<br/>\nand said: &quot;Hey Mom, I&#39;m done!&quot; My family later went out to eat and<br/>\ncelebrate.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am a proud product of the nontraditional education method known as <br/>\nhome<br/>\nschooling. Actually, calling it nontraditional is a bit of an <br/>\ninaccuracy.<br/>\nBefore public schools were a reality, home school was pretty much the <br/>\nonly<br/>\nway to get an education. But in today&#39;s world, it is often seen as an<br/>\nanomaly.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope I don&#39;t offend anyone (although I probably will), but the <br/>\ntruth is,<br/>\nGeorgia&#39;s school system is terrible. Our SAT scores rank 50th in the <br/>\nnation.<br/>\nOur schools are overcrowded and understaffed, resulting in less one-<br/>\non-one<br/>\ntime between teachers and students. The teachers we do have are <br/>\nusually<br/>\noverworked, underpaid and stressed beyond reason.<br/>\n <br/>\nAdditionally, there&#39;s a whole mentality that comes with public <br/>\nschool - you<br/>\nlearn what the school tells you to learn, when and how they tell you <br/>\nto<br/>\nlearn it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf the school board decides the theory of evolution or the Civil War <br/>\nshould<br/>\nnot be a part of the curriculum, you may not learn about those <br/>\nsubjects<br/>\nuntil college. Everyone is measured against a standard, and if you <br/>\nfall<br/>\nshort of that standard, you&#39;re lost.<br/>\n <br/>\nOnce you&#39;ve taken into account school violence, budget cuts, zero <br/>\ntolerance<br/>\nand, of course, the teen drama (such as cliques and gossip), school <br/>\nisn&#39;t<br/>\nalways the ideal learning center it is meant to be.<br/>\n <br/>\nHome schooling is one of the fastest-growing forms of education in the<br/>\nUnited States. In 2003 there were an estimated 1.7 million to 2.1 <br/>\nmillion<br/>\nchildren (grades k-12) receiving a home school education, according <br/>\nto the<br/>\nNational Home Education Research Institute.<br/>\n <br/>\nCompare that to 1973, when there were only 10,000 children home <br/>\nschooling.<br/>\nGeorgia has a fair number of home schooled students - 31,732 as of <br/>\n2002. And<br/>\ncontrary to popular belief, home schooled kids are not isolated, anti-<br/>\nsocial<br/>\nweirdos. We make up a large and diverse community.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs a home schooled student I didn&#39;t have to deal with unnecessary<br/>\ndistractions and I could focus on my education. I could also study <br/>\nthings<br/>\nthat interested me, so while most of my high-school-age buddies were <br/>\ngriping<br/>\nabout having to read &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (which I had read back in <br/>\nmiddle<br/>\nschool after seeing the play) and having to write reports about the<br/>\nRenaissance, I was happily reading &quot;Beloved&quot; and learning about the<br/>\nZapatista movement.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne question that I&#39;m often asked is: &quot;How do you make friends?&quot; <br/>\nApparently<br/>\nthere&#39;s this assumption that since I&#39;m taught at home, I never go <br/>\noutside.<br/>\nNothing could be further from the truth.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was always superbusy, often doing things my peers couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nbecause of<br/>\ntheir school schedules. I&#39;ve taught a creative writing class at Brown <br/>\nMiddle<br/>\nSchool and traveled to Brazil and Germany.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy activities and hobbies - which include theater, dance, filmmaking <br/>\nand<br/>\njournalism - have ensured cool people surround me and that I usually <br/>\nhave<br/>\nsomeone to hang out with on Friday nights.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis fall, I will continue my education at Sarah Lawrence College in <br/>\nNew<br/>\nYork. Though I&#39;m somewhat anxious, I&#39;m not intimidated. A home school<br/>\neducation has definitely given me the tools to succeed in college and <br/>\nin<br/>\nlife.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks to my learning environment, I&#39;m independent, self-motivated, <br/>\nfocused<br/>\nand ready to take on the world.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n------<br/>\n----<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;Nasah Crockett participated in a summer writing program at Vox, a<br/>\nnewspaper for Atlanta teens.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98456,"nextTopicId":98532}}
