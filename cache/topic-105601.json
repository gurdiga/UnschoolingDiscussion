CPS, anywhere that you believe it will be of use<br/>\nto �unschoolers�/�homeschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be noted that arriving at the advice I have<br/>\ngiven is a result of : speaking with an attorney that<br/>\nspecializes in �homeschool� advocacy, approx. 40 hours<br/>\nof research focused entirely on dealing with CPS and<br/>\n�homeschoolers,� and a completely positive outcome<br/>\nthat ended with no entry to my home, no interviews<br/>\nwith my self, my husband or our 4 children and no<br/>\nfurther contacts with CPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe anger that Katy is now feeling is part of<br/>\ngrieving. The emotional turmoil this event causes<br/>\ntruly is the death of security for an unschooler�. The<br/>\nmajority of my online unschool time was filled with<br/>\nlegislative �homeschool boards for 2 years after this<br/>\nincident occurred.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about being nice or polite or &quot;appearing&quot;<br/>\ninnocent. It&#39;s about ending the investigation as<br/>\nquickly and completely as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nPLEASE, take the documents to the worker. DO NOT open<br/>\nthe door for her, or any other government authority,<br/>\nwithout a search warrant.<br/>\n(Which, her having the documents should prevent being<br/>\nissued.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your home met the standard for &quot;neglect&quot; I would<br/>\nassume she would have moved to remove your child at<br/>\nthe time. However, if she was coming back for a second<br/>\nlook-see, I would spend my time putting all the<br/>\nfurniture back in place, sweep, mop, vacuum, whatever<br/>\nmight be viewed as &quot;messy&quot; on the slight chance that<br/>\nshe does decide to return with a warrant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are parents who have made that invitation and<br/>\nhad the child removed on the spot. Rare? Yes. But not<br/>\nif you are the one it happens to. Then it&#39;s a 100%<br/>\nrate of occurrence.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow are the comments to which I am referring.<br/>\nPlease do not mistake my additional entreaties as<br/>\npushiness. It&#39;s just that- having experienced this<br/>\nsituation, I am painfully aware of the sticking<br/>\npoints. -Those being the ones that will get you Stuck<br/>\nin a Great Big Mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned before, I too did the &quot;polite&quot; thing.<br/>\nThough I denied her entrance into my home, I called<br/>\nand set up an appointment for her to come a few days<br/>\nlater.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did that out of fear and arrogance. She&#39;d threatened<br/>\nto burst in with the police- causing Fear. And, I Knew<br/>\nthat MY home and MY children were far above any CPS<br/>\nstandard- Arrogance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you have nothing to hide ... &quot; This is the naive<br/>\nposture that keeps most �homeschoolers� feeling safe.<br/>\nIt&#39;s like the flotation device, aka seat cushion, in<br/>\nan airplane. Has anyone Ever been saved by one of<br/>\nthose things? I seriously doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing upright, caring, loving, committed, responsible,<br/>\nresponsive and willing-to-die for your children will<br/>\nNOT prevent CPS from showing up at your door and<br/>\ndeciding that you are in need of intervention.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe fact that she showed up has confirmed the first<br/>\nhalf of that scenario. It is your job to eliminate the<br/>\npossibility of further consequences.<br/>\n <br/>\nCPS is not generic. For all practical purposes, It is<br/>\none individual, with her own beliefs, preconceived<br/>\nnotions, limited education and 5 inch thick department<br/>\nmanual, who has the authority to traumatize your<br/>\nentire family. The prerogative to use that power may<br/>\nbe why she took the job. Or maybe not. What is certain<br/>\nis that inviting her in like a neighbor foolishly<br/>\nignores the reality of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nKATY,<br/>\nGetting over your rudeness from breaking your date<br/>\nwith her will happen much more easily with your child<br/>\nsafely at home. Do you really care about disappointing<br/>\nthis woman&#39;s plans more than preserving the integrity<br/>\nof your family?�<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is not coming for tea. She is making a second<br/>\nvisit to interrogate you, your child, your husband and<br/>\nto see if you&#39;ve had Hazel come and make your place<br/>\nshiny and clean enough to warrant her approval. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know that she has not yet judged you &quot;fit&quot;.<br/>\nOtherwise, she would not be returning.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for the educational issues, the NM law with which<br/>\nyou are in compliance seems to cover that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs your follow-up mentions, she was not there to<br/>\ninvestigate educational issues- at all. Don&#39;t offer<br/>\nany information in that area. <br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS is why you should have been given a report with<br/>\nspecific charges denoted. She&#39;s fishing ... which<br/>\nmakes her an antagonist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for her &#39; &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; give me a copy until the<br/>\ninvestigation was complete. &#39; This is b--- s---.<br/>\nThis is a tactic that is used to keep you in the dark<br/>\nand fearful. I would call the state attorney&#39;s office<br/>\nand ask them what the legal procedure entails. Does an<br/>\nindividual being investigated have the right to know<br/>\nwhat the allegations against them are?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour cop friend knows what &quot;neglect&quot; in a home looks<br/>\nlike. It&#39;s not your house, or she&#39;d have removed your<br/>\nson at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour friend who suggested complying is giving you the<br/>\n&quot;company line&quot;.  It comes from a place of employee<br/>\nloyalty. It is not good legal advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nStay strong, refute the charges and the result should<br/>\nbe in your favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will assemble the best �homeschool� legal � sources<br/>\nwith which I am acquainted and post asap. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nof any &quot;Complete&quot; resource. Though, I do know that<br/>\n�NHEN� was attempting to create one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelinda<br/>\n__________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 1         <br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 23 Apr 2005 10:38:07 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: CPS suggestions Follow-Up<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/22/2005 10:42:48 PM Mountain<br/>\n&gt; Daylight Time,  <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:melinda2u@...\">melinda2u@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also,  just as you don&#39;t want to invite in<br/>\n&gt; authorities<br/>\n&gt; without a <br/>\n&gt; warrant,  likewise, I would not offer anything<br/>\n&gt; beyond<br/>\n&gt; that which <br/>\n&gt; proves you&#39;re  legal and that your child is healthy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; CPS has no business evaluating  your records. <br/>\n&gt; Should<br/>\n&gt; they do <br/>\n&gt; so and decide that they aren&#39;t  sufficient, then<br/>\n&gt; another Pandora&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; box could be opened.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ===========<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all true.<br/>\n&gt; It maybe be that if she agreed for them to come<br/>\n&gt; back, they&#39;re coming back,  <br/>\n&gt; though.<br/>\n&gt; Depends on the state, the county, whether she signed<br/>\n&gt; something maybe.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I would DEFINITELY ask for the records in advance. <br/>\n&gt; There might be  something <br/>\n&gt; in there that lets you know who reported it, and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s possible that  would <br/>\n&gt; help.

Sorry Mary Ellen, and thanks for letting me<br/>\n&gt; know.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for all of your responses.  I am a little<br/>\n&gt; calmer now, though still scared and confused,<br/>\n&gt; wondering who would do this.  Actually this morning<br/>\n&gt; those feelings are fading and I am getting more and<br/>\n&gt; more angry...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am in New Mexico.  <br/>\n&gt; In NM we have to submit a form by April 1 every year<br/>\n&gt; notifying the state that we are homeschooling,<br/>\n&gt; maintain immunization records, maintain records that<br/>\n&gt; you have a diploma or GED,  and it is SUGGESTED that<br/>\n&gt; you keep a &quot;school&quot; calendar.  <br/>\n&gt; I  have done all of these things, I am fully legal,<br/>\n&gt; though the calendar is really just my little day<br/>\n&gt; planner, it does have all of our trips and stuff.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I wrote before, the report stated that Richard<br/>\n&gt; has never been to school and that I am not<br/>\n&gt; registered (I am), but it also stated that we live<br/>\n&gt; in &quot;filthy&quot; conditions with &quot;clutter and clothes&quot;<br/>\n&gt; all over the place that you can hardly walk around. <br/>\n&gt; It said that my house stunk and that it was a fire<br/>\n&gt; hazard because of all the clutter.  This is<br/>\n&gt; considered personal neglect, which is why CPS is<br/>\n&gt; involved, and not dept of Education, though they<br/>\n&gt; certainly had a lot of questions about our<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling!<br/>\n&gt; My house is cluttered, but certainly not a fire<br/>\n&gt; hazard!  I am in the slow process of painting the<br/>\n&gt; bedrooms, so most of the stuff from my bedroom is in<br/>\n&gt; the front room.  At the moment we don&#39;t go in there<br/>\n&gt; (the front room) at all, as there are two living<br/>\n&gt; areas.  The process is so slow because I work full<br/>\n&gt; time and I spend as much of my time off with<br/>\n&gt; Richard, not on house-related stuff.  So yes, I<br/>\n&gt; admit it is messy.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know someone in another branch of the Children<br/>\n&gt; Youth and Families Department who gave me the<br/>\n&gt; impression that it was better to comply with letting<br/>\n&gt; the officer into my home, now I question that<br/>\n&gt; decision.  :~(  Her thought was that I had nothing<br/>\n&gt; to hide, so don&#39;t act like it.  I have gotten all of<br/>\n&gt; my paperwork together, and am going to put together<br/>\n&gt; a &quot;curriculum&quot; (thanks for the link Sandra).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When she first showed up, I had just gotten done<br/>\n&gt; with 3 night shifts.  I don&#39;t usually work nights,<br/>\n&gt; but I was covering for someone who was on vacation. <br/>\n&gt;  So when the officer showed up I was sleeping.  She<br/>\n&gt; looked around and informed me of the complaint, and<br/>\n&gt; said that she would come back for her formal visit. <br/>\n&gt; I immediately went to the childcare and while I was<br/>\n&gt; there she showed up to talk to Richard, so she<br/>\n&gt; talked to him with me there.  I was told that in<br/>\n&gt; cases where child safety is concerned they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to allow the parent to sit in the interview<br/>\n&gt; with the child.   She was surprised that the police<br/>\n&gt; had not already contacted me, she said that in cases<br/>\n&gt; of suspected child neglect the police will come and<br/>\n&gt; inspect the property.  I have a friend who is a cop<br/>\n&gt; who happened to come by tonight, so I asked him<br/>\n&gt; about it.  He said yeah, your house is messy but it<br/>\n&gt; is not what they are looking for when they suspect<br/>\n&gt; neglect.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My thinking now is that as Roslynn and Sandra<br/>\n&gt; mentioned I did pretty much say it was ok for her to<br/>\n&gt; come back, so if I were to not let her in now it<br/>\n&gt; would look bad.   I did ask for a copy of the<br/>\n&gt; report, and was told that she &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; give me a<br/>\n&gt; copy until the investigation was complete.  She said<br/>\n&gt; that the report was anonymous, and when I looked<br/>\n&gt; over her shoulder there was no name where the<br/>\n&gt; reporter would go, but I guess that really doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mean anything.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You know, before this happened to me, when I would<br/>\n&gt; read about things like this happening to other<br/>\n&gt; people I would think, well, there must be something<br/>\n&gt; else going on.  There must be some &quot;real&quot; reason for<br/>\n&gt; them to be investigated.  I am appalled at my<br/>\n&gt; thinking now.  <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for all of your support and responses,<br/>\n&gt; Katy<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 7         <br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 23 Apr 2005 15:21:11 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Mary&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: CPS Suggestions<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Melinda,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if it would be okay for me to<br/>\n&gt; forward your email to my local<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling group?
