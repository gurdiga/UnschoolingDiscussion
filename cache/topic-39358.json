Particularly, when our daughter&#39;s friends were just starting school<br/>\nand again when she decided not to attend High School. (School years are<br/>\nseparated differently in Australia - Primary School is up to and including<br/>\nYear 6 and High School being Years 7 to 12.)  I hope my thoughts are<br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The problem we are having is our youngest, who sees her friends (all ages)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>getting ready to go &gt;back to school and going for the first time.

Maybe you could make up a lunch box for her for a little while so<br/>\nshe feel like her friends. After all, she probably has very pleasant<br/>\nassociations with picnics which is what a lunch box probably represents in<br/>\nher experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not let her design her own assignments on subjects that interest her.<br/>\nWhether or not she ever completes the assignments could be her choice - our<br/>\ndaughter, on occasion, has insisted I put pressure on her to finish what she<br/>\nhas started so she can feel a sense of accomplishment on completion. Even if<br/>\nno assignments are ever completed what she will learn about about the<br/>\nsubject and how to research a topic are valuable anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve tried to handle some of this by supplying her with &quot;school type&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>books (she loves them and &gt;does them with no prompting from me although she<br/>\nreally wants me to say &quot;ok, now it&#39;s time &gt;for...&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible that the real &quot;problem&quot; here is that your daughter is not<br/>\nchoosing to learn the way you think she should.  I have found that, for us<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; is about letting go of our preconcieved ideas of how a child<br/>\n&quot;ought&quot; to learn and respecting the learning style of the child at any given<br/>\ntime.  If your daughter is happy to learning by doing worksheets and using<br/>\n&quot;school type books&quot; why not let her?  There is a big difference between<br/>\nhaving to use a particular resource and choosing to use it. (If you REALLY<br/>\nwant her to stop using these books why not try making her sit down and do<br/>\n&quot;school&quot;. lol)  What she covers in her &quot;school books&quot; can be a wonderful<br/>\nspring board for discussion about how the knowledge is used in the real<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wants a timetable why not involve her is setting one up that doesn&#39;t<br/>\ninconvenience others - a great lesson in time management.  By trying to<br/>\nstick to a schedule she will learn how restricting it is to have a timetable<br/>\ndictate when and for how long you can study a particular subject.  On the<br/>\nother hand, she may thrive on having her days regulated.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 13 yo daughter has gone through several phases where she wanted her<br/>\nlearning to be more regulated.  None of which lasted long.  Each time she<br/>\nhad bought into the &quot;social wisdom&quot; that says learning only happens when you<br/>\nare made to do &quot;school work&quot;.  It never took long for her to find the<br/>\n&quot;school work&quot; boring and restrictive and revert to, what I prefer to call,<br/>\n&quot;free-range&quot; learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and when school starts again in this area I want<br/>\n&gt; to do something with her (and older son) to help take the sting out of her<br/>\n </span></blockquote>friends not being around &gt;much anymore.

Is it the<br/>\nsocialization, because there would not be as much as she probably thinks<br/>\nthere is, with her coming from an unschooling family.  Maybe she wants a<br/>\n&quot;desk&quot; of her own, for &quot;school&quot;.  Is she involved in any extra-curricular<br/>\nactivities with her friends, like gymnastics, sports, or dance, etc...??<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my meanderings for the morning........mind you I am barely awake......<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87403280,"authorName":"Jeff & Kate Kerr","from":"Jeff & Kate Kerr &lt;windystreet@...&gt;","profile":"saffronwoman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"how to unschool when your child wants to go to school","postDate":"1027522740","msgId":39358,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEM0VDMEIyLjE4RTVGODExQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjc0ODQyOTUuNDA5LjkxOTY4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39359,"prevInTime":39357,"nextInTime":39359,"topicId":39358,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve been unschoolers for a few years now, it s a philosophy I have embraced since before I had children and my husband joined me in this attitude with very","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-992251403\">We&#39;ve been unschoolers for a few years now, it&#39;s a philosophy I have embraced since before I had children and my husband joined me in this attitude with very little persuasion.  Our oldest child is also a dedicated unschooler, he can&#39;t imagine having to sit in<br/>\na classroom and do what is told, no time for spontaneous reading or cookie baking or trips to the beach.<br/>\nThe problem we are having is our youngest, who sees her friends (all ages) getting ready to go back to school and going for the first time.  She wants to be just like them, she loves to sit at the table with assignments and wants to be a part of the lunch box<br/>\ncarrying crowd.  I&#39;ve tried to handle some of this by supplying her with &quot;school type&quot; books (she loves them and does them with no prompting from me although she really wants me to say &quot;ok, now it&#39;s time for...&quot;) and when school starts again in this area I want<br/>\nto do something with her (and older son) to help take the sting out of her friends not being around much anymore. (Even the ones who homeschool are &quot;going back to school.&quot;)  Maybe a trip to the dinosaur exhibit at the Natural History Museum?<br/>\nAnyway the point of this is to ask:  What do you do when the whole family is unschooling and one doesn&#39;t want to?<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nto be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting.  e.e.cummings</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39351,"nextTopicId":39413}}
