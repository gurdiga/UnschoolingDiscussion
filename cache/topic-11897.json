Last year I <br/>\nwent to the Drs and he said &quot;Tamie, some people can smoke all their lives and <br/>\nnever really show any problems. You are not one of them!!!&quot; I quit using the <br/>\npatch the following Monday. I quit for 5 months and felt great. Then had an <br/>\narguement with my mom and let it go down the drain.(bad excuse , I know) Now <br/>\nmy chest hurts all the time and the cough is embarrasing. Im only 29 and <br/>\nsound like 80!!! <br/>\nThanks Everyone<br/>\nI would like to hear other peoples quitting stories , if there are any. I <br/>\nthink it will help to hear Im not the only one to screw it up after 5 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamie&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Tamie: <br/>\nhubbie and I quit before I got pregnant with Zak and then once he was born, <br/>\none night I went out with friends when he was 9 months old and I picked up a <br/>\ncigarette and then proceeded to smoke 5 a day for the next 1 year... Then we <br/>\nquit again for another 2 years and again I went out to a Casino this time and <br/>\nstarted smoking and then hubbie started smoking... Quit and started, quit and <br/>\nstarted, quit and started and this has been going on for 3 years.... Neither <br/>\nof my kids have ever seen us smoke... and today we haven&#39;t smoked for 3 <br/>\nmonths, but we could smoke tomorrow if we are not careful....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a one day at a time thing for us... It&#39;s the hardest addiction <br/>\nthere is (for anyone that knows anything about addictions)... It&#39;s more <br/>\naddicting than heroin and it&#39;s the most widely accepted (after alcohol)....<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck... I will be saying a prayer for you and hope you&#39;ll say one for me <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11893,"nextTopicId":11894}}
