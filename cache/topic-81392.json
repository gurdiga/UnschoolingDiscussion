A few years ago <br/>\nwhen my oldest two were 12 and 13, the alternated with the job of daycare at the <br/>\nlocal Gold&#39;s Gym, which is less than half a mile from our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter always wanted a ride, my son always wanted to walk (12). Suddenly <br/>\nmy son was getting dropped off by our &quot;friendly&quot; Deputy almost every single <br/>\ntime he walked home, which wasn&#39;t late at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I thought it was the cop being friendly but Matthew didn&#39;t seem to <br/>\nthink it was.  The cop was always smiling and waving when he pulled in the <br/>\ndriveway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew said it always went like this:  Where are you going son?  Home.  <br/>\nWhere have you been son?  Gold&#39;s Gym, I work there.  Where do you live son?  Vista <br/>\nWoods, around the corner.  Get in son, I&#39;ll take you home.  That&#39;s OK, I can <br/>\nwalk.  Why don&#39;t you want a ride son?  Is there any reason you don&#39;t want to <br/>\nget in my car?  No sir, thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told my son if it bothered him he could certainly politely decline a <br/>\nride and just keep walking.  This apparently angered the &quot;friendly cop&quot;.  He <br/>\nwanted to know WHY he didn&#39;t want the ride, kept following him as he walked.  <br/>\nBlocked his path with the car and got out, told him to STOP, which Matthew <br/>\ncomplied with.  Asked if he could search him, Matthew wanted to know why.  Well, if <br/>\nhe was refusing to be searched there had to be a reason.  This all occurred <br/>\nwithin yelling distance of our home.  The cop KNEW where he lived, worked, his <br/>\nname, everything but was being, well, NOT the friendly neighborhood cop.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this time when he bring my boy home, he come to the door to tell me that <br/>\nmy son was rude with him and he thinks he might be in some trouble.  TROUBLE?  <br/>\nAll the nice cop wanted to do was offer him a ride home and my son refused to <br/>\nget in the car, that&#39;s grounds for arrest he tells me.  OK, now you GOTTA take <br/>\na ride from the nice stranger cause he wears a uniform?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt got ugly. He brought up that Matthew asked why he wanted to search him, <br/>\nwell you are 12 if you have cigarettes it&#39;s against the law.  Why would he think <br/>\nhe had cigarettes?  Because he&#39;s 12?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we ended up with quite the conversation about laws and civil rights <br/>\nand he wanted to take ME to jail because I &quot;threatened&quot; him to stay away from <br/>\nmy son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sheriff was much more understanding.  He was even more understanding some <br/>\nweeks later when this same cop started following my son home from school <br/>\n&quot;chatting&quot; with him about checking him for cigarettes or lighters or anything that <br/>\nmight be illegal.  I called the sheriff&#39;s office.  They told me no officer <br/>\nwas in the area at that time of day.  I went and witnessed it for myself and <br/>\ncalled, gave them the car number.  Again they denied it.  So I called the Sheriff <br/>\nat home, he came and waited with me the next day.  Guess who showed up <br/>\ndriving slowly behind my boys all the way to my corner?  Same cop, same no longer <br/>\nnow a cop.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because they wear a badge doesn&#39;t mean they are always the good guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154862465,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re:  Police Scare today.","postDate":"1064413463","msgId":81404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGNzFBOTE3LjQwOTA3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDRhLjIyN2IwNmQxLjJjYTJmNTZhQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDRhLjIyN2IwNmQxLjJjYTJmNTZhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":81403,"nextInTopic":81408,"prevInTime":81403,"nextInTime":81405,"topicId":81392,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s why the call to the police up-set me, people do know my <br/>\nkids and where they live and they should have called me first.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nlived in this town my whole life, it&#39;s so small it&#39;s actually called <br/>\na village.  As far as I was concerned the kids have never left the <br/>\nyard without supervision and they were (suppose to be) playing in <br/>\nthe backyard.  It&#39;s a shame I can&#39;t trust them now to be out for 10-<br/>\n15 minutes in our own back yard, while I work on other things and <br/>\ncare for their baby brother, whom was being rocked to sleeep at the <br/>\ntime.  The business parking lot they were in is right next door.  <br/>\nThere was no reason for them not to send them home if they were <br/>\nbothering them, instead of calling the police.  I understand the <br/>\npolice were doing their job, but really the kids were right next <br/>\ndoor to our property, not wondering all over town.  The other kids <br/>\ntheir age that do wonder all over town without supervision have <br/>\nteased my boys in the past that I won&#39;t let them leave the yard <br/>\nwithout an adult or their sisters.  That&#39;s why I just feel like this <br/>\nis a case of lets tweek the home schooler.  The people at the <br/>\nbusiness could have easily told them to go back into their own yard <br/>\nor we&#39;re going to call your mother.  My husband went across the <br/>\nstreet to ask the people at that business if they had seen the boys <br/>\nand if they were being troublesome and they said no, if they had <br/>\nthey would of came to our door, as they know who we are.  I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand why the other business couldn&#39;t have had the same <br/>\nattitude about it.  Perhaps, I&#39;ll go over and ask them, but I have <br/>\nto calm down first.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, my boys were in the wrong <br/>\nfor leaving the yard without permission, but in this situation it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t require all this extra attention.  Especially, like I said <br/>\nwhen other kids their age run around town all of the time.  It&#39;s <br/>\nsimply a case of some people in our society doesn&#39;t like seeing kids <br/>\nout of the public school, even in their own back yard (or pretty <br/>\ndarn close to it).<br/>\nRobin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81466,"nextTopicId":81218}}
