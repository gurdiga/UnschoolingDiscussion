The cause of <br/>\nWHY the body presented symptoms will not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee some of Dr. Schimmels work on functional medicine:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://spanda.com/books/functional.html\">http://spanda.com/books/functional.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you may also want to look up some of the newer research that will <br/>\neventually land in the likes of people like Dr. McDouugall, just as the <br/>\ndiet change theorys should of been pushed by the medical community in the <br/>\n50s, 60s, 70s & 80s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sanum.com/literature/index.htm\">http://www.sanum.com/literature/index.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, on a lesser degree of physics, McDougall&#39;s food would <br/>\nprobably fare well for some of the people, yet its full of yeast, and <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t fare well for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe use of vinegar in the no-oil dressings, the added yeast, could be <br/>\nmost harmful to many (See The Yeast Connection). Or worse yet, is most <br/>\npeople are strewn with <br/>\nMucor Racemosus and it feeds on yeast products. (Vinegars, nuts, dried <br/>\nfruit etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest thing I could find in english is:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/6171/medicine.html\">http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/6171/medicine.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEssential fatty acid deficiencies are known to be genetically <br/>\npre-disposed. (see Professor Enderlein&#39;s findings). Yet, McDougall <br/>\ndismisses the need for fish oils. Again, a one size fits all for a <br/>\nculmination of cultures that can&#39;t fit in one size.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is &#39;vegetarian is always better&#39; doesn&#39;t have the facts to back <br/>\nup the chronic illnesses of our society. A lot of the &#39;healthy&#39; soy <br/>\neaters I see in the organic stores have a grey-ish tint to their skin. A <br/>\nfact of observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I can go on and on and present facts contrary to the superficial, <br/>\nsymptom-reducing ones of McDougall, let me stop here at his recipes that <br/>\ninclude microwaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure, as an MD, he would of been privvy to the study done by Bernard <br/>\nH. Blanc, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and University, Institute <br/>\nfor Biochemistry and Hans U. Hertel, Environmental-Biological Reserach <br/>\nand Consultation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis comparitive study about food prepared conventionally and in the <br/>\nmicrowave oven measures the effects of microwave irradiated food on man - <br/>\nas opposed to non-irradiated food - showing changes in the blood of <br/>\ntest-persons, indicative of an early pathogenic process, similar to the <br/>\nactual start of cancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMicrowaved food caused significant changes in the blood of the <br/>\ntest-persons including a decrease of all hemoglobin values, increast of <br/>\nthe hematocrit, leukocytes and cholesterol values, especially the HDL and <br/>\nLDL Lymphocytes. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a fact, I had a great-niece and a 2 nieces that are extremely <br/>\nallergic to soy and soy products.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne-size does not fit all.<br/>\n<br/>\nwith kind regards,<br/>\nkolleen<br/>\n<br/>\nps: I haven&#39;t read Diet for a New America.
