And we all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well be misunderstanding you. It can be easy to get flustered and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; express<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself in ways that might not really illustrate what your life and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; children&#39;s lives look like.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps that is because from the beginning of my posts I was accused,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; misrepresented and had things assumed of me.  I was put on the <br/>\n&gt;defensive,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and when I forced myself to stop being defensive, I was told I am a bad<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mother so I pretty much just went away yesterday (had more important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things to do anyway) before I could even get a word in good about any of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my kids.  And the thing is there are pompous people on this list who <br/>\n&gt;keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saying they want to help people and that they should not judge and that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they should listen and give people the opportunity to explain.  None of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that happened to me when I joined this list.  Even when I explained or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expanded on statements, they were still taken to mean what certain <br/>\n&gt;people<br/>\n&gt; &gt; initially assumed about them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If this is any indication of what happens here regularly, that&#39;s scary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because many people I know, would have left before they ever could have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gotten any useful or friendly posts of which there have been many.  Had <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not weathered the initial negativity, I would never have know many of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Now, if you would like to hear the good things that go on here, I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happy to share, assuming that I am not going to be accused of lying,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; misresenting or just plain not knowing what the hell I&#39;m talking about <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been over our problems.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Rachel (the one on prozac and allergic to corn) is 16 and is a great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; driver.  She has had her liscense for about 6 months now and I really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know what I would do without her.  She is now my chauffer and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; love it.  She is also my musical one.  She has a keyboard and is self<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taught.  One night I heard what I thought was one of the programmed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pieces playing from her keyboard and I walked in to find her playing it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She has borrowed a violin from a friend and is trying to learn that now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too.  She also makes hemp necklaces and gardens and is &#39;wickedly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ironical&#39;.  She is the one who coined, &quot;Well of course more people died<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than at Pearl Harbor, inflation you know.&quot;  She took the ACT (so she can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go to college) with three weeks notice and score a composite 24.  Pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cool for a kid who has done practically nothing remotely resembling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;schoolwork&#39; for 6 years.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jenni (allergic to milk) is the reader and the real voice of humor in <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; family.  She spouts deadpan humor so well I can&#39;t even duplicate it <br/>\n&gt;here.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  She also whipped through the entine Janet Evanovich seven book series <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about a week and a half and two of the days were spent waiting for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; next book to show up.  She is 14 going on 35, can find a pun in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; haystack of needles.  Loves animals and little kids but does not want to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be a veteranarian or a pediatrition because she just could not stand to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; put them to sleep.  (There&#39;s that humor.)  She is also the one who can <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; found lyingon the picnic table next to her father at night watching the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sky.  I really don;t know what they are looking for but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tell me when it arrives.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wyndham is the problem child.  He is 9 and has the potential to be a <br/>\n&gt;very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; troubled human being.  He is mildly OCD, allergic to everything and just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plain difficult.  All the same, the girls say I love him best.  I think <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just love them the amounts they need to be loved and he needs more.  He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a mechanical marvel.  He likes to build things and take them apart.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He is learninghow to drive the tractor this week with the help of both <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husband and our exchange student.  He talks a lot.  Rachel once told him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that he is like the radio always on, so sometimes we forget to listen.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All in all, he is not a &#39;bad&#39; kid,  he just needs lots and lots of extra<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attention to grow up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We moved last summer from a busy city street to a busy country one.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have 8 acres on a state route just south of Akron, Ohio.  Close enough <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the hospital and city but in a place that feels very rural.  It has <br/>\n&gt;apple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trees, pear trees, cherry trees, grapes and raspberries all of which <br/>\n&gt;were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cultivated then allowed to go wild for 15 years.  We are trying to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reestablish the gardens and grape arbors but they are all so overrun, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is a difficult and slow job.  We are dicussing clear cutting the arbor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because we are not making much progress separating the grapes from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; multiflora rose.  My herb garden is still in pots but I have hopes for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; next spring.  My vegie garden produced tomatoes and zucchini this year,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and some peas for snacking on but they never made it into the house.  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also got some cute little mini watermelons about te size of baseballs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Cute little things, and they tasted great.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have plans for a pond and possible some more critters of the larger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; variety.  We also have a trail through the wooded back half of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; property.  But what sold us on it was the fact that this property has <br/>\n&gt;two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; houses.  One for us and one for my mother.  We had been living two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; counties away from each other and this is great.  We can help her when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she needs it but she still has her own place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bridget<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~   F u cn rd ths u cnt spl wrth a dm! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If electricity comes from electrons . . .<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  . . . does that mean that morality comes from morons?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!

And we all may very <br/>\nwell be misunderstanding you. It can be easy to get flustered and express <br/>\nyourself in ways that might not really illustrate what your life and your <br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives look like. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my perspective, most of what you have posted really doesn&#39;t look like <br/>\nunschooling--particularly &quot;pure&quot; unschooling. That doesn&#39;t mean that lots (or <br/>\neven most) of what you and your kids do DOESN&#39;T look like that. But most of <br/>\nwhat you&#39;ve shared has looked pretty structured.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, most of what you&#39;ve shared about your kids has been their <br/>\nproblems or bad habits. Now all of us, including our kids, have those. But <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t really shared much about what&#39;s really wonderful about your kids, <br/>\nor your own Ah-HAH moments. Maybe that&#39;s because you&#39;ve felt you&#39;ve needed to <br/>\ndefend yourself. But the result is that you come off looking like you see <br/>\nyour kids as adversaries, and yourself as extremely controlling.  From your <br/>\nfriend&#39;s post, I recognize that those are probably not true, but your <br/>\ndescriptions of your life are very different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a gentle list. The most vocal people are very protective of the <br/>\nconcept of unschooling, and often come off as quite harsh. But consider the <br/>\npossibility that while most of what you do might look like unschooling, what <br/>\nyou have described on the list does not. You might make decisions based on <br/>\nwhat you feel your kids need that don&#39;t fit into Radical Unschooling, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s fine. But try to understand that all we know about you and your life <br/>\nis what you say here. When one feels misunderstood by a whole lot of people, <br/>\nit usually means there&#39;s a problem with how they&#39;re communicating.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonni Sollars","from":"Bonni Sollars &lt;BSOLLARS@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"pr9WknsXoHv7CbbFovcIuIRUPMoZju2R4nxITl9qAxWWA65u4Moi2_HTFoiLf1I4UBMceOZ-9kZTghhKe3K51fbr9pwHhQWa","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Attacks and such","postDate":"1000304521","msgId":25435,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTEyLjEwMjIyMC4tNjYwMTUuMS5ic29sbGFyc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":25426,"nextInTopic":25438,"prevInTime":25434,"nextInTime":25436,"topicId":25417,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Bridget, sounds like a great life!

Let me tell you something that I once<br/>\nwitnessed.  I worked in the daycare area of a church for all the ladies<br/>\nBible Studies when my kids were babies.  There was this one little boy<br/>\nwho was so difficult, he wouldn&#39;t let anyone talk to him or come near to<br/>\nhim because his mother was gone and he was mad about this.  He also<br/>\nkicked and hit and cried constantly because of it.  Most children would<br/>\nget over it a few minutes after Mom was gone, but he kept on.  He would<br/>\nsettle down a little to play all by himself in a corner, but I felt it<br/>\nwas impossible to reach him.  His mom was amazing!  She would hug and<br/>\nkiss him and praise him for doing such a great job, etc.  Before I knew<br/>\nit, he was totally happy there and full of joy.
