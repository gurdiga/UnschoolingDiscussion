I first came to the list about a month ago, feeling frustrated with the way in which our first year of homeschooling had gone.  it wasn&#39;t all bad, but I was in frequent power struggles with my oldest son, (5 yr. old) and couldn&#39;t get out of the mold we had squeezed into by having him attend Montessori School the year before.  I had even gone to a few Montessori conferences and had planned on becoming a Montessori teacher in order to pay for my kids to go there.  So when I changed my mind, pretty spontaneously, last Spring and told them not to expect either of us back next year, I set up my upstairs like a montessori classroom and wondered, months later, why it wasn&#39;t working.  Ironically,  I am one of those who decided to homeschool when my first son was still a baby because I read John Holt&#39;s Learning All the Time.  So how did the whole Montessori interlude happen?  I was afraid of not being able to talk to my oldest son, who I believed was very defensive and incapable of listening. ( I know)  I wish I had reread Holt or come here so much earlier in the year.  i have immersed myself in this loop and have had a thousand revelations as a result about all of the ways in which I am responsible for all of the power struggles we had.  Since lurking here, I haven&#39;t been coaxing, demanding, whining or expecting.  I have been lurking!  That&#39;s it.  Lurking here, lurking with the kids (unless asked to help with something)...  I can&#39;t wait for the conference.  I have talked two friends here into going who are not Unschoolers (yet!) and only hope that I will soon have some more local support.  So far I know no one Unschooling around here.  I knew that once I posted I wouldn&#39;t be able to shut up, so i apologize for going on.
