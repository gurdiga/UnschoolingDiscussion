I just spent yesterday <br/>\ntrying to figure out a single pole construction medieval tent. I <br/>\nfound pretty good instructions online for the straight walled <br/>\nstyle....I can do all the wood construction myself, but sewing 54 <br/>\nyards of heavy duty canvas totally overwhelmed me.<br/>\nI was going to do a hub that fits over the center pole and has spokes <br/>\ngoing out to the sidewalls, hence no need for side poles. Very cool <br/>\nand very period.<br/>\nI&#39;m still pondering whether to attempt something like this, or just <br/>\nbuy one of those pop up patio things and attach my own canvas to make <br/>\nit sturdier and more period looking.<br/>\nI&#39;m also trying to come up with a plan for my hawks mews/weathering <br/>\narea which takes priority over a tent right now.....but both require <br/>\nmath that I don&#39;t have in my brain right now.
