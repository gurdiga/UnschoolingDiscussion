It was literally the only way I could put <br/>\nhim down without him screaming.  He would walk around in the thing in <br/>\nthe kitchen while I fixed meals.  He spent maybe a total of 30 <br/>\nminutes a day in it.  30 happy minutes for both of us.  He is almost <br/>\n5 now and walks fine, he started walking at 11 months, not early for <br/>\nmost babies, and he has no spine or hip problems.  I will forever be <br/>\nthankful for the walker we had when he was a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Differing views of safety","postDate":"1082472551","msgId":92910,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM0MjZlNiRhNGQ5ZmVhMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGM2MzZpOCtoOTY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":92905,"nextInTopic":92932,"prevInTime":92909,"nextInTime":92911,"topicId":92884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: averyschmidt  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1455244612\">From: &quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patti.schmidt2@...\">patti.schmidt2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t see how in small doses they&#39;d be bad for any kind of<br/>\ndevelopment.

My MIL is almost continually shocked with what my kids do. There&#39;s nothing off limits and I don&#39;t babyproof. But I don&#39;t like walkers because they sort of lift a baby out of her natural limitations and abilities and make things like stairs or stovetops availible to her that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be. And yes, I watch the kids, I&#39;ve watched my two year old play with a plug and outlet and my four year old use steak knives and decided against baby gates and running to catch falling babies. But I also think babies are short and counters are high for a reason and I really don&#39;t want to fool around with the equation by adding something that gives a baby reach and mobility it&#39;s not supposed to have yet. That said, it&#39;s all about my comfort level. I don&#39;t think anything bad of moms that use them when they&#39;re aware of the dangers and watch the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Differing views of safety","postDate":"1082397923","msgId":92885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2MTRkMytqdWF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMzkwMWM0MjVhOCQ2ZWFiNzNjMCQ4MmJkYjFkOEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":92884,"nextInTopic":92886,"prevInTime":92884,"nextInTime":92886,"topicId":92884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... talk about ...
