But for me it didn&#39;t happen all at once. The <br/>\njoy of learning and doing is contagious. I myself was completely damamged as <br/>\na recovering &quot;A&quot; student and college graduate.

Want to hear about last week when I was so fatigued that I <br/>\nstayed in bed for 48 hours? ;-) There&#39;s also those weeks where no one seems <br/>\nto have any cool ideas and so we just veg a lot with TV and movies.

That&#39;s <br/>\nNOT 24/7. And we all know how much wasted time there is in a supposed school <br/>\nday anyway. And parading homeschooling materials in front of them might make <br/>\nyou feel beter for awhile, but wait until you feel like you have to force <br/>\nthem to come to the table and &quot;do this work!&quot; Talk about exhausting!

Or didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink it important enough to spend the requisite amount of time on? <br/>\nUnlikely for a historical event like that, but possible.

Part of me loves learning and <br/>\nresearching, but then there are times when I get SO TIRED and don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel like doing much besides lurking on computer websites ;)  and <br/>\nwatching tv.  I don&#39;t sew, do crafts, or take classes on my own.  I <br/>\njust cook regular dinners, nothing fancy or gourmet.
