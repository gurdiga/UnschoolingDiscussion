For my seemingly simple plea<br/>\nthat they be treated as people whose reasonable rights were (are) being<br/>\ntrampled, I was amazed at the reaction. I can&#39;t believe that hsers could<br/>\nfeel the way we&#39;ve had expressed here. Blame the victims! is what I<br/>\nhear...they brought the problem upon themselves. I can&#39;t buy that. But, sad<br/>\nto say, a similar attitude has existed in CT for many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope is that everyone know his/her rights -- not just the ones permitted<br/>\nby the government of your state, but those you are born with and cannot be<br/>\ninfringed by any laws. Start with how you want to live your life. If you&#39;re<br/>\ncontent to obey the big one -- &quot;do unto others..&quot; -- then it seems to me<br/>\nthat no one has the right to force you to do anything against your will,<br/>\never.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want you to express your freedom, if you have time for that. If your state<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t give you freedom to live as you&#39;d like, something is wrong, and I<br/>\nhope you will help change it so that your kid and mine will live in more<br/>\nfreedom than we have, and under less of a threat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit that I see things through political lenses. We live according to<br/>\nlaws. If those laws restrict us unnecessarily or onerously, then they are<br/>\nbad, and we need to change them. If someone can tell me that there is a<br/>\nlarge group in MA that is helping the Bryants so that all homeschoolers in<br/>\nthe state will have easier, less hassled lives, I would be pleased.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unschooling, the big trick for many parents is learning not to<br/>\nbelieve that your child needs schooling as you remember it. I did not<br/>\nrealize until I was about 40 that I had had a miserable time in school. All<br/>\nthat time, from varios influences and explicit teaching, I believed that I<br/>\nhad enjoyed school.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly with the perspective of time was I able to realize how limited my life<br/>\nhad been. Luckily for me, my school had a good program of sports, and I was<br/>\nintimately involved in those. It was the UNschooling at school that gave me<br/>\nthe feeling that I was enjoying the whole thing. I can say with total<br/>\nconviction that I learned almost nothing from the schooling, but everything<br/>\nimportant from the sports, the clubs, the trips, the singing (choir and<br/>\nchorus), times spent in casual conversation with teachers, etc. Here&#39;s the<br/>\ncatch for homeschoolers: All of that good stuff is available, full time,<br/>\noutside of schools. Don&#39;t ever believe that your kid is missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive the children the advantage they have by not being in schools. Give your<br/>\nchildren access to people doing real things. Do you need examples. I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink so, but take your kid places. It doesn&#39;t need to be far. Walk, and<br/>\nget in the habit of talking to people who are doing what they&#39;re interested<br/>\nin...the shopkeeper, the butcher, the mechanic, reporters, etc. They will<br/>\nlove your attentions, and your kid will take it all in and participate.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Gatto talks about real learning. He tells us that we need to learn real<br/>\nstuff. He believes that learning to build a house is urgent business, and<br/>\nlearning to build a proper boat, and knowing how to make good clothes, and<br/>\ngrow good food are essential knowledge. I agree. John Gatto says that if a<br/>\nperson doesn&#39;t know how to perform essential functions of living, such as at<br/>\nleast a few of the above, then that person has no business teaching his kid.<br/>\nMost teachers have no clue about the above, and the world outside the school<br/>\nhouse walls scares them. I was married to one, briefly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want you to do is the same I want for the children. To start living<br/>\nyour real life, not the one you think you are expected to live. I see the<br/>\ntwo as vastly different for many people. The Sudbury Valley School has a<br/>\ngraduation policy: You can graduate any time you feel you are ready. I think<br/>\nkids should start their lives whenever they want to. Mine took charge very<br/>\nwell, at age four. We gave him the reins, so to speak. We did the feeding<br/>\nand some grooming. All he needed was our trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n Today&#39;s life is synthetic. Many people feel the need to do crazy things<br/>\njust to feel alive.  I&#39;ve been lucky in having had a varied life so far. I&#39;m<br/>\n68. Training and work designing lots of people&#39;s houses, private school<br/>\nteaching -- most subjects, most grades, professional skiing and golf,<br/>\nfarmer, contractor, store owner, antique dealer, elected office holder,<br/>\nwrote two books, published both,  more. I can ride a horse, sail a boat, fly<br/>\na small plane, build a house, play three instruments poorly, make tv<br/>\nprograms twice a month. None of the above was learned in school. I did study<br/>\narchitecture, but I had to learn the real stuff after grad school. I wasted<br/>\nforever in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want you to do is to believe in yourselves, not wait for anyone to<br/>\nsay it&#39;s OK to do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nA great example of what we need to overcome is the belief that things are<br/>\ndifficult and that we can&#39;t do them without experts telling us how.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was asked to teach school at some friends&#39; school. I can&#39;t believe my<br/>\nfirst reaction, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know how.&quot; After 18 years in classrooms,<br/>\nimaging feeling I couldn&#39;t teach 2nd grade. They handed me the book,<br/>\nTeacher, by Sylvia Aston Warner, the New Zealander (whom I met years later<br/>\nin Colorado where I was living and she came to teach in a school I helped<br/>\nstart) and the next morning I was perfectly prepared to teach school. We had<br/>\na ball, too, and I felt like most teachers do -- I was doing something<br/>\nterribly important, blablabla. Nonsense. It was prison for them and for me.<br/>\nMy work was making it sufferable, because not going through it in those<br/>\ndays, was un-imaginable.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we know better. Just do it. Learn as you go. Start in the middle.<br/>\n Nothing is hard to do, if you want to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the above is dangerous advice, too. I don&#39;t care. I want you to live<br/>\n-- if you want to. I am on the side of individuals, not institutions or<br/>\ngroups. I want individuals to take advantage of the freedoms we are all born<br/>\nwith in this country.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuz and I have had two encounters recently that are significant. One, with a<br/>\nwoman from Taiwan. We met because of our website and she phoned me two<br/>\nmonths ago and that convinced her to come here. She has friends in RI and so<br/>\nit was not far to visit our home with her wonderful 9yo son. They are the<br/>\nleaders of the homeschooling group in Taiwan. that country is considering<br/>\nmaking Hsing illegal, but she is leading the fight to keep it legal.<br/>\nImagine, this tiny oriental woman, standing like the student in front of<br/>\nthat Chinese tank, fighting the Taiwan government, almost single-handedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other was in Germany. Our unschooled now college grad son was traveling<br/>\nin Germany a month ago when a woman emailed us from Dusseldorf about<br/>\nhomeschooling. It is illegal there, but she was planning to move to Canada<br/>\nso she could homeschool her now 4yo boy.  We gave her our son&#39;s email<br/>\naddress and she contacted him in Berlin and he took the train across Germany<br/>\nand spent two days with her little family. Her first homeschooler, and he<br/>\nwas most impressive to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am saddened that on opposite sides of the world, there are modern<br/>\ngovernments, and so many people here too, that are opposed to letting their<br/>\ncitizens exercise freedom of education.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nIf you want to unschool your kid, you need to unschool yourself first.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40588,"nextTopicId":40761}}
