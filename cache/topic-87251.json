Some parents don&#39;t have that luxury, I&#39;m grateful <br/>\nfor it.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a litle late getting in on this discussion.  I just now went <br/>\nback and read all the talk on degrees and unschooling.  I find the <br/>\ndiscussion very interesting however, I did read this sentence and <br/>\nwas compelled to put my .02 in about how &quot;lucky&quot; some of us are to <br/>\nbe able to stay home with their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuck has nothing to do with my being able to stay home with my <br/>\ndaughter.  My husband and I planned from the time we talked about <br/>\ngetting married and having a family right away that one of us would <br/>\nstay home with her (preferably me but, there have been times when it <br/>\nwas him).  Then, we sat down and talked about what we needed to do <br/>\nto make that happen(ie, what bills do we need to pay off so that we <br/>\ncan lower out debts and live on one income).  Next, we both worked <br/>\ntwo jobs so that we could pay off our credit cards and our cars and <br/>\nthen put some money in savings as a small cushion &quot;just in case.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving on one income has nothing to do with luck, it has to do with <br/>\nplanning (in our case, a lot of it) and being willing to put your <br/>\nkids before all the wonderful new &quot;stuff&quot; you might like to have.  I <br/>\nknow lots of people (mostly friends of friends) who always say how <br/>\nlucky I am to be able to stay home and how much they would enjoy <br/>\nbeing able to do that.  The next thing I know they go out and buy a <br/>\nmuch bigger much more expensive home and two brand new cars!  No <br/>\nwonder she can&#39;t stay home.....she would rather have the new SUV (I <br/>\nLOVE my SUV but, it&#39;s certainly not new) and the big house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course (since I have such a hard time keeping my mouth shut) I <br/>\npointed out the contradiction in what she was saying and what she <br/>\nwas doing.  When I told her that, if she and her husband would quit <br/>\ngoing out to dinner (and breakfast and lunch) everyday, stayed in <br/>\nthe smaller house, and hadn&#39;t bought two brand new cars, she would <br/>\nbe able to stay home with her son, she wasn&#39;t too happy with me <br/>\nbut....oh well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am just so sick of having people tell me how lucky I am to stay <br/>\nhome and then go out and spend thousands on &quot;things&quot; that they don&#39;t <br/>\nneed.

Now I am very excited to be writing<br/>\nfeature film scripts. <br/>\n<br/>\nCould I have done all this with a baby? Not with the full immersion in<br/>\neither baby caring that I did when Jayn was born, or in the degree studies<br/>\nand extracurricular stuff. Film work is usually at least 12hour days also.<br/>\nSome things are more compatible with having children than others, some<br/>\neducation options are more compatible with attachment parenting (including<br/>\npart time studies or internet college); some careers are more compatible<br/>\nwith unschooling than others - for me that is working from home as a script<br/>\nwriter instead of a production designer. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll I know is we rarely (actually only ever one occasion a few months ago)<br/>\nleave Jayn with other people, so she is with either me or James 24 hours per<br/>\nday. We like it this way. If I wanted to further my formal education, or<br/>\nenhance my degree qualifications (don&#39;t have a reason to right now) it would<br/>\nmean a lot of work from James. I would be looking for alternate self study<br/>\nmethods. I wish my career had been so fabulous that I missed working. Most<br/>\nof the movies were pretty crummy, and not wonderful working experiences<br/>\neither. The high point: I met my husband on the first movie I worked on when<br/>\nI arrived in Los Angeles.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

For a long time I joked that I had more children <br/>\n&gt; than chapters, but that changed.  I actually hand-wrote much of my <br/>\n&gt; dissertation because I worked in the playroom with my kids. I also worked <br/>\n&gt; at night and in the wee-wee hours.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t found my education background particularly detrimental to <br/>\n&gt; unschooling, but I was not an ed. major. I was an English major; I taught <br/>\n&gt; at Penn State for 6 years before we moved away. Part of my dissertation <br/>\n&gt; deals with the early stages of what became liberal, public education and <br/>\n&gt; the beginnings of women&#39;s education. This has actually helped me to see <br/>\n&gt; education as just a bunch of theories laid out by guys like Jean-Jacques <br/>\n&gt; Rousseau who really didn&#39;t have a whole lot to recommend them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I don&#39;t use my education in homeschooling, I think it did give me a <br/>\n&gt; certain amount of confidence in myself. I think I&#39;m far more capable than <br/>\n&gt; anyone else of deciding what&#39;s best for my children--hubris that may or may <br/>\n&gt; not have been there otherwise. I taught lots of education majors, and they <br/>\n&gt; were, as a group, some of the worst students I had. Unable to write <br/>\n&gt; coherent thoughts or punctuate and dead set against anything that resembled <br/>\n&gt; critical inquiry.

That was easy, compared to what I imagine a dissertation would demand while <br/>\nunschooling with children. (Took the kids to see &quot;Cheaper By the Dozen&quot; <br/>\nyesterday btw &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    After years of family life and happy unschooling, I didn&#39;t bother with <br/>\nthe coursework to keep up my certification, and it&#39;s just as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n       But imo educators weren&#39;t idiots as a group or individually, not then <br/>\nand not now. Most my colleagues earned my respect, and I had disdain for only <br/>\na few, based on who the individual was, not what group or label I assigned <br/>\nthem to. Same with the parents and community leaders we worked with -- respect <br/>\nfor most, disdain for a few. I was further educated and enormously enriched  by <br/>\nmany of them. <br/>\n<br/>\n       And I could work with them all, expert or not, even the raging <br/>\negomaniacs and the truly idiotic. Even some who couldn&#39;t spell and punctuate. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       These parallel discussions about degrees and credentials and parents <br/>\nput me in mind of the old NHEN Legislative list, and a thread called &quot;Experts, <br/>\nRuffians and Being Foolish&quot; in Sept 2002.<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage #18,062<br/>\n<br/>\n       . . .a major<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; premise of homeschoolers is that you don&#39;t need credentialed experts to<br/>\n&gt; effectively share knowledge or skills. We &quot;just moms/dads&quot; are literally<br/>\n&gt; walking our talk. Any person or organization that isn&#39;t willing to avail<br/>\n&gt; itself of the expertise of &quot;just moms/dads&quot; is, IMO, foolish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       Yes! Any person or organization unwilling to avail itself of input or<br/>\nexpertise of any kind is indeed foolish. Isn&#39;t that what learning is all<br/>\nabout?<br/>\n<br/>\n       But I do feel the need to point out that this includes actual<br/>\ncredentialed experts, too, with whom homeschoolers seem to have something of<br/>\na love-hate relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n       We beat the stuffing out of most experts just because they are<br/>\nexperts, but then exalt to expert status uncredentialed experts with whom we<br/>\ndo agree. We then use these self-created experts to beat the stuffing out of<br/>\neach other! Or we pronounce ourselves certainly not experts but knowledgeable<br/>\nbased on our &quot;experience&quot; -- no doubt the root of the word expert in the<br/>\nfirst place -- without ever facing the fact that we do this as a preface to<br/>\nimparting our &quot;expertise!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n       We brag about our own lack of credentials (or downplay the ones we do<br/>\nhave) in the same breath we brag about our children earning those same<br/>\ncredentials! We ask each other for help but then push each other away if the<br/>\nhelp seems too &quot;professional.&quot; We are deeply suspicious of any expertise that<br/>\nearns money for the ones offering it. Et cetera.<br/>\n<br/>\n       In fact, having just read this, I&#39;ll bet most hsers would now argue<br/>\nwith the statement that began it.
