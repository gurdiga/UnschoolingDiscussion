I had a chemistry teacher tell us once that <br/>\nwe should know how to do paper-and-pencil arithmetic really well because some <br/>\nday we might be taking the SAT or something and the batteries in our <br/>\ncalculators might give out.  These days you can use a calculator on the SAT.  <br/>\nThe interesting thing is that a calculator will not help you for most of the <br/>\nproblems.  What WILL help is good mathematical intuition, not arithmetic - <br/>\nthey&#39;re not the same thing.<br/>\n       Even if you can do long division in your head, you may not know that <br/>\nit&#39;s based on the distributive property.  The reason so many parents and <br/>\neducators stress basic arithmetic is because they think it will teach you <br/>\nsomething deeper about math than using a calculator, but I don&#39;t buy it.  I <br/>\nwould bet a lot of money that few kids who know long division would be able <br/>\nto tell you it&#39;s an appplication of the distributive property.<br/>\n       If the educational establishment was actually serious about the &quot;you <br/>\nmight need this some day&quot; excuse for teaching you something, we&#39;d be learning <br/>\nvery different things.  There are few things more essential to life than <br/>\ngrowing food.  What if there were another national emergency like WWII, and <br/>\npeople had to turn their yards into gardens?  You might need to know how to <br/>\nmake your own bread or slaughter an animal some day, but no one is learning <br/>\nthat in schools these days.<br/>\n       I hope I&#39;m making sense.<br/>\n       If I had to guess I would say that fewer than 10% of people need to <br/>\nknow any math beyond the 7th grade level.  And a lot of people would be <br/>\nbetter off if they understood 7th grade math in greater depth and how to <br/>\napply it better.  So what is math beyond 7th grade good for?  I think it&#39;s a <br/>\nsubconscious conspiracy.  Schools don&#39;t teach higher math because kids need <br/>\nto know it.  The neat thing about math is that for grading and judging young <br/>\npeoples&#39; &quot;intelligence,&quot; it&#39;s very handy.  Your answer is either right or <br/>\nwrong.  It&#39;s not messy, like history.  Educators can pretend that they are <br/>\nbeing very objective (and therefore fair) when grading math tests.  Nevermind <br/>\nthat the emphasis on higher math is a subjective choice on the part of <br/>\neducators.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLoren Kelley<br/>\nHomeschooling father<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"math and what it&#39;s good for","postDate":"1026045072","msgId":39038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1LjFlNWYwMGM1LjJhNTk4ZTkwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39099,"prevInTime":39037,"nextInTime":39039,"topicId":39038,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/6/02 9:58:27 PM, PSoroosh@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-716898847\">In a message dated 7/6/02 9:58:27 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PSoroosh@...\">PSoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; he said, &quot;So this is sort <br/>\nof like a line graph right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, it IS a line graph,&quot; and he said, <br/>\n&quot;I know how to do that, you find the slope.&quot; As if that was the point of it. <br/>\nAbsolutely no comprehension of any meaning of what he was doing.

If you choose 20, you can select a 4x5 <br/>\nblock, or a 2x10 block, in either direction.   Holly beats me at that game.   <br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t know what to do with 27, so she skips it.  She doesn&#39;t like 24 <br/>\nbecause 2x12 isn&#39;t an option, so she skips it.  She likes 30 fine.  She LOVES <br/>\n6. It&#39;s a time-race to fill the grid.   I &quot;know times tables&quot; better than <br/>\nHolly, but Holly has no shame about taking two easy moves instead of one <br/>\nglory move like &quot;32.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school they taught us to add columns of numbers.

I confessed one day <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t really add columns of numbers.  He said &quot;Oh, you do it like a <br/>\ncomputer does it.  Like a calculator does.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell cool!
