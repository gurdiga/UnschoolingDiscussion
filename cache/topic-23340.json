I assign the land you sojourn in to you and your <br/>\noffspring to come, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting holding. I will <br/>\nbe their God. . . . Such shall be the covenant between Me and you and your <br/>\noffspring to follow which you shall keep: every male among you shall be <br/>\ncircumcised. (Genesis 17:6,8,10)<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the centuries there has been much written by Jewish scholars about the <br/>\nimportance of circumcision. Support for circumcision in the Jewish community <br/>\ntoday is widespread. There is another perspective on circumcision that is not <br/>\nopenly discussed. Contrary to common belief, circumcision has not always been <br/>\npracticed. Moses failed to circumcise his son (Exodus 4:25), and circumcision <br/>\nwas totally neglected during the forty-year period in the wilderness (Joshua <br/>\n5:5). Some Jews in the Hellenistic period (circa 300 b.c.e.-100 c.e.) chose <br/>\nnot to circumcise their sons in an attempt to gain public acceptance.1 During <br/>\nthe Reform movement in Germany in the 1840s, some parents did not circumcise <br/>\ntheir sons. Theodor Herzl was one of the most prominent figures who did not <br/>\ncircumcise his son, who was born in 1891.2 <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, circumcision is not universal among Jews either inside or outside <br/>\nthe United States. The Circumcision Resource Center, a nonprofit educational <br/>\norganization, knows of hundreds of Jews in Europe, South America, and in the <br/>\nUnited States who either have not or would not circumcise a son. Even in <br/>\nIsrael some Jews do not circumcise, and there is an organization that <br/>\npublicly opposes circumcision.3 The purpose of this article is to coherently <br/>\nexplain a few of the contemporary reasons for the increasing doubts some Jews <br/>\nhave about circumcision. Then I will apply Torah law and Jewish values to <br/>\nthese reasons.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23337,"nextTopicId":23335}}
