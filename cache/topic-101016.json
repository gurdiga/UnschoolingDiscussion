You know, they <br/>\nalways have to counter EVERY homeschool article with some less than <br/>\nenlightened school administrator - fortunately for the reporters, they <br/>\nare very easy to find. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n========<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were interviewed for TV, once, for a weekly parenting segment, a few years <br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe night it was to have come out, something else was there.  The next week, <br/>\nsomething else.  I called and they said they might use it somewhere else.  <br/>\nFinally it showed, on another night (I guess they were saving it for a night <br/>\nwithout a car wreck or a stabbing).<br/>\n<br/>\nI though our parts were really pretty good!  But what they had been stalling <br/>\nabout, I guess, was &quot;balancing&quot; it.  So there were two inserted pieces where <br/>\nthey had gone to the office of some education professor at the university of <br/>\nNew Mexico, and in her dark office at her cluttery desk, probably without having <br/>\nseen the footage of us at all, she made two damning pronouncements:<br/>\n1. homeschoolers won&#39;t get to socalize with other kids<br/>\n2. homeschooled children are limited to  the knowledge their parents have<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT&#39;s the crap that needed a rebuttal, but all in all she had a PhD and I&#39;m <br/>\n&quot;just a housewife.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of people I know (not homeschoolers) saw it and said so.  We taped <br/>\nit, but accidently erased it one day, which was a little sad, but not TOO sad.  <br/>\nThe ignorance of the professor was the really sad part.  SHE needed to <br/>\nsocialize with some people who weren&#39;t education-bound, and maybe to get some <br/>\nknowledge other than what her journals were providing (if she even reads journals).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100922,"nextTopicId":101017}}
