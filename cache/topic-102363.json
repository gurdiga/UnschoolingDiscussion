It has all our  board <br/>\ngames and puzzles.<br/>\nJust leaving it all out for awhile led to many discoveries.  Forgotten  games <br/>\nas well as miscellaneous things like magnets, balsa wood and  mystery cards.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe usually pick out one or two really old ones that we never play any more  <br/>\nto give away to younger kids and to make room for our newest games.  Lego  <br/>\nIsland and a game called Secret Door made way for some of our newest games from  <br/>\nChristmas...Set, Imaginiff and Cranium Conga.  Imaginiff is a great group  <br/>\ngame...it says 12 and up but I think maybe 9 and up with a little help.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne example I remember is &quot;If ______ were  a type of soup what  would she <br/>\nbe.&quot;  I was in the blank and from the 6 choices my 2 kids and  ex-husband said <br/>\nChicken Noodle.  I said Split Pea!  Then they all told  me why they chose what <br/>\nthey did.   The idea is to choose the answer  most of the other people will <br/>\nchoose but it&#39;s still very revealing and can make  some fun connections.  The <br/>\npeople playing the game take turns being   in the &quot;fill-in-the blank&quot; spot but <br/>\nyou can also put in other people like Sponge  Bob or Chandler from Friends or <br/>\nyour kids favorite grandparent..... Definitely  my favorite new game!<br/>\n <br/>\nAny other new (or old)  games you all would recommend?<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102359,"nextTopicId":102358}}
