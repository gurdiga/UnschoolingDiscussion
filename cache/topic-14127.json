We are now facing a fine of 40 000 skr ($4500/£ 2700) if we<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t send our children to school right away. We are not<br/>\n&gt; asking for your money, but rather for your help in emailing the<br/>\n&gt; authorities in Sweden and asking them to withdraw the fines and let<br/>\n&gt; people homeschool.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the meantime we have been forced to flee our home to another school<br/>\n&gt; district within Sweden where they hopefully are more<br/>\n&gt; tolerant of homeschooling. But we miss our home and our life, and we<br/>\n&gt; want to move back to our farm. And we are not alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Friends of ours have already had to move within Sweden. Homeschooling is<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; legal in Sweden and we have the same laws for the<br/>\n&gt; whole country but they are just not interpreted in the same way in every<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; legal district. So people have to move to different parts of<br/>\n&gt; Sweden because of their beliefs. Other homeschooling friends of ours<br/>\n&gt; have just fled to the UK since they didn&#39;t feel safe in their own<br/>\n&gt; home. We miss them a lot already.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Swedish Minister of Education has just, in a TV program, expressed<br/>\n&gt; that she wants to make it even more difficult to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool in Sweden in the future by changing the laws. This will mean<br/>\n&gt; that we will see more refugees from Sweden because of<br/>\n&gt; their beliefs as the interest for homeschooling increases.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So what we are asking you about is your support in helping us to protect<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; our right to homeschool in Sweden, and to guarantee every<br/>\n&gt; Swedish child the right to homeschool if they desire, now and forever.<br/>\n&gt; Please help the Sweden authorities understand that<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling is an excellent way of educating children and that you are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; aware of the persecution of homeschoolers in Sweden.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Below is a list of people or places you could email on our behalf with<br/>\n&gt; some suggestions what to write about. A short but personal<br/>\n&gt; note to one or all of them below is perhaps best. Please express your<br/>\n&gt; feelings in a friendly and non-aggressive fashion. In all<br/>\n&gt; messages please include something like:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;In Vingaker in Sweden, the Berkestam-Drysen family is being persecuted<br/>\n&gt; for homeschooling. The school authorities are Barn- och<br/>\n&gt; utbildningsnamnden, Box 133, 643 22 VINGAKER, SWEDEN. Please contact<br/>\n&gt; them and ask them to withdraw their fines and let the<br/>\n&gt; family live in peace in their home and according to their beliefs about<br/>\n&gt; schooling.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could write to the Swedish Minister of Education - Ingegerd<br/>\n&gt; Wärnersson : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:registrator@...\">registrator@...</a> and ask her to<br/>\n&gt; please respect Fundamental Human Rights when they pass a new law on<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling so that Swedish citizens don&#39;t have to be<br/>\n&gt; persecuted and forced to flee due to their beliefs. Why not tell her<br/>\n&gt; that homeschooling is rapidly growing worldwide, and that passing<br/>\n&gt; laws that forbid homeschooling will just make more conflicts in the<br/>\n&gt; future?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could write to the Swedish Embassy in your country saying something<br/>\n&gt; like &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t Sweden respecting the<br/>\n&gt; parents right to educate their children the way they see fit?<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers are forced to be fugitives, fleeing their homes to avoid<br/>\n&gt; further harassment by the authorities in Sweden.&rdquo; If you<br/>\n&gt; don&rsquo;t get a reply, email them again and ask why they are not<br/>\n&gt; replying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Swedish Embassy in the US: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ambassaden.washington@...\">ambassaden.washington@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; , in UK is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:embassy@...\">embassy@...</a> , Australia<br/>\n&gt; and New Zealand is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ambassaden.canberra@...\">ambassaden.canberra@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could write to one of the major Swedish News papers telling them<br/>\n&gt; what you think when a democratic country like Sweden is<br/>\n&gt; violating individual&rsquo;s Human Rights in this way. Tell them that<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling is growing around the world, and it&rsquo;s<br/>\n&gt; part of the solution to problems in society, not one of the problems.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joachim.berner@...\">joachim.berner@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Contact our local politicians and ask them to respect Human Rights and<br/>\n&gt; to act in a more human and understanding way. Ask them<br/>\n&gt; to withdraw their fines and work for a solution in respect of our<br/>\n&gt; beliefs. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kommunstyrelsen@...\">kommunstyrelsen@...</a> (Kommun in Swedish means<br/>\n&gt; municipality).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could also send the above message to our local newspaper. It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; small paper and they would probably appreciate getting this<br/>\n&gt; kind of attention from the big world. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redaktion@...\">redaktion@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If there are any questions or if we can be of any assistance for other<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers in any way please contact us at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:magnus.drysen@...\">magnus.drysen@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your time and support.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We love homeschooling!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Magnus Drysén & Maria Berkestam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S. Please pass this message on to as many other homeschoolers and<br/>\n&gt; other people who you think could be of assistance to us in<br/>\n&gt; anyway in this matter. We are sending this message to homeschoolers in<br/>\n&gt; Sweden, USA, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Norway,<br/>\n&gt; Australia and New Zealand<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14071,"nextTopicId":14128}}
