Having adopted five children from the foster care system, I can tell you that the termoil and upheavel","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-436683851\">What are some opinions about the probability of many<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;of these children having been misdiagnosed, medicated without need,<br/>\n&gt;possibly having emotional issues stemming from foster care or previous<br/>\n&gt;problems that &quot;look&quot; like ADD symptoms, etc.??  How difficult is it to take<br/>\n&gt;a child off medication?  How would you assess the true nature of a child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;condition, abilities and needs when they are already on medication?  How do<br/>\n&gt;you approach this issue in a way that is healthy and non-threatening to the<br/>\n&gt;child?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having adopted five children from the foster care system, I can tell you<br/>\nthat the termoil and upheavel in the child&#39;s life during their time in the<br/>\nsystem is enough to make them ADHD!  They spend so much of their young lives<br/>\nworried about where they are going to be next, who will care for them, why<br/>\nthey can&#39;t be with their birth family, that they have no time or energy to<br/>\nfocus on learning, and paying attention to what is really happening at that<br/>\ntime.  They are then diagnosed and medicated (much easier on overworked<br/>\nfosterparent). Having been a foster parent to many of these children I tell<br/>\nyou how overworked and under supported these people really are.  Even though<br/>\n3 of mine were so young at the time of their adoptions that they had no<br/>\ndiagnosis placed on them, that as they enetered public school and began to<br/>\ndeal with the issues of their placements with us they experienced the same<br/>\nenergy draining and difficulty focusing on current life.  And yes they were<br/>\nmedicated as part of a larger program of treatment that included therapy,<br/>\nand changes in parenting styles to help them learn better coping skills.<br/>\nTwo have been able to use this as the learning tool it was meant to be and<br/>\nare no longer on meds.  The other has more extensive problems and is no<br/>\nlonger on meds for ADHD but is still on mood altering meds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Should I avoid children who are being medicated as a matter of course?<br/>\n&gt;Would the situation be too sticky to embroil ourselves in if there is<br/>\n&gt;psychological drugs present? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you object to drugs across the board?  Could you use them as the help to<br/>\ntransition a child and give the child the help to learn new coping skills,<br/>\nand give them the space to work thru their issues with your love and<br/>\nsupport.  Then they can often be dropped down the road as the child settles<br/>\nin.  If you can&#39;t see the use of the meds in this light, then bringing a<br/>\nchild currently on meds into your home might not work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyone have any info to share?  Anyone also<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have any leads or suggestions of areas/agencies for us to check into for kids?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is an organization in Rochester New York Children Awaiting Parents<br/>\n(CAP) that has a photo listing service of children across the country that<br/>\nneed families.
