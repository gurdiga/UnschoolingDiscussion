LLL <br/>\nsuggested food allergies, so I went thru the list one by one. I went without <br/>\ncorn, chicken, dairy, eggs, nuts, blah blah blah, I don&#39;t remember what all, <br/>\nfor a few weeks. Then worked each of them back in. He had intense screaming <br/>\nfits following the dairy and eggs. My entire family, except my ex who was <br/>\nthere, thought I was nuts, or that it was just a series of coincidences and I <br/>\nwas too dim to know that. It gets really old having people dismiss what you <br/>\nknow to be true with your own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally believe that all illnesses/conditions are a mix of dietary and <br/>\nemotional issues. When I get sick, it isn&#39;t just stress, and it isn&#39;t just <br/>\ndiet. It&#39;s usually a mix of both. When I&#39;m stressed, I don&#39;t eat well, which <br/>\nis when the body really needs good stuff while being overtaxed. When I don&#39;t <br/>\neat well, I don&#39;t feel well and life&#39;s little ups and downs seem more <br/>\nstressful. I have seen enough to know that my son is allergic to milk, in <br/>\ngood times and bad, but that in bad times the allergic reactions are more <br/>\nintense. I think that only makes sense, anything would be more intense when <br/>\nyou&#39;re already stressed/upset. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the stress <br/>\ncaused the allergy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s both. And it can be hard to say which is more influential <br/>\nsometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27769,"nextTopicId":27561}}
