I wonder if everyone is<br/>\nhaving nicer weather?  We had friends over last night, stayed up late and<br/>\nthis morning are sort of .... not moving very much. &lt;G&gt;  I&#39;m going to try<br/>\nand answer some of your thoughts, but don&#39;t be surprised if I ramble a lot.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel I need a little encouragement,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; since I&#39;ve gone off the structured road to a less structured path,<br/>\n&gt; and I wonder sometimes if I&#39;m on the right track.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Was the structured track the right one?<br/>\n<br/>\n I would very much<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; like to hear your feelings, suggestions, and practical suggestions<br/>\n&gt; for keeping three kids in 7th, 6th, and 2nd grade up to par,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is really hard for most unschoolers to answer.  First you have to<br/>\ndefine what is *up to par*, whose par?<br/>\n<br/>\nbut<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learning properly,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What would learning improperly look like?  But more importantly, what is<br/>\nyour working definition of working properly??<br/>\n<br/>\n**and maintaining my sanity if at all possible. **<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is part of the equation. I think parenting as an<br/>\noccupation is designed to make us all question the concept of sanity. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n I   know I&#39;m burned out at this point, but I don&#39;t have much of a support<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; system, and the kids are getting to thee point where they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; listen as well as they used to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s where we can help, but first we have to have more specifics. What has<br/>\ncreated your burn out?  What are you burned out from?? Is it standing over<br/>\nthem making them do *school*? Is it just being the one responsible for the<br/>\nfamily and household, the laundry, the food, the noise, the cleanliness?<br/>\nand children are supposed to grow up into adults who think for themselves,<br/>\nnot listening is a sign of growth, which is good.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have CD rom programs, I have big<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all in one type books, and I allow everything to be a lesson in their<br/>\n&gt; day.  I would very much appreciate your help and understanding, and I<br/>\n&gt; hope to do the same for you somehow.  Thank you so much, Janice<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part of the problem may be looking at life as a series of lessons.  It is,<br/>\nbut most of those lessons are silent moments of understanding how the world<br/>\nworks, or what makes mom and dad tick or get ticked.  Not everything in life<br/>\nis an academic lesson, nor should it be.  And I don&#39;t feel our children need<br/>\nto spend hours a day hunting for academic lessons, I would prefer they just<br/>\nlive.   Most of the time academics take care of themselves and sometimes we<br/>\napproach a topic with intention.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell us what life was looking like and what you did to change things... and<br/>\nthen maybe we can help you understand???<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"H082rJSh_gq0TSHkrtzeQXKWGQn5ILP1_RWBwXUNngldQdFN27FtalGARhZuwKrifnXl3CMaF1ac","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I&#39;m new to board, but have been unschooling for 8 years...","postDate":"983508059","msgId":16728,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRmLjgyMTM3NGEuMjdkMDdlNWJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16726,"nextInTopic":16729,"prevInTime":16727,"nextInTime":16729,"topicId":16726,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-  I feel I need a little encouragement, since I ve gone off the structured road to a less structured path, and I wonder sometimes if I m on the right track.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1516287331\">-=-  I feel I need a little encouragement, <br/>\nsince I&#39;ve gone off the structured road to a less structured path, <br/>\nand I wonder sometimes if I&#39;m on the right track. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch better than this list for encouragement would be to go to <br/>\nwww.unschooling.com and read in the library/essays, and read the recent <br/>\npostings in folders.
