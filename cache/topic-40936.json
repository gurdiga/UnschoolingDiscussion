I&#39;m not <br/>\nagainst lessons per se. Just the idea that 3 year olds need to be in lessons <br/>\nin order to get comfortable in the water. Or that kids in general can&#39;t <br/>\nlearn some decent strokes on their own without lessons.<br/>\nI know, I know, I&#39;m preaching to the choir here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She enjoys it a lot, and he&#39;s talked about how much faster she learns than <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the 5 yr olds he teaches - probably mostly because she&#39;s not 5.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was thinking about this as I was dropping Casey off this morning for a <br/>\ncrafts class at the local elementary school. Why does society have such a <br/>\nneed to push teaching down so young? The idea of PamS&#39;s Kindergarten <br/>\nreadiness story. Don&#39;t they see that learning is so natural when we wait <br/>\ntill the child is ready rather than having yet another class to teach <br/>\nreadiness skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, I know, I&#39;m preaching to the choir again. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40935,"nextTopicId":40938}}
