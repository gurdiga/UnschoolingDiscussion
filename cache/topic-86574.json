Its become the<br/>\nparent&#39;s agenda and not the child&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could mean that - or it could mean that the child doesn&#39;t have much of a<br/>\nsense of time, or is extremely forgetful.  I have one of those &lt;grin&gt; (who<br/>\nsaid that it is okay to use this example).  My 15 yo has been fascinated<br/>\nwith insects for the last decade.  He volunteers at the Arthropod zoo at a<br/>\nscience museum.  I have to remind him every other week to send the director<br/>\nan e-mail arranging a time.  Now - this is his thing, not mine.  It&#39;s a 2<br/>\nhour round trip, and I have to find things to do with the other two children<br/>\nin the area while he&#39;s volunteering (the other people at the musuem are<br/>\ngetting to know us *really* well &lt;grin&gt;).  Quite frankly, it would be much<br/>\neasier for me to not remind him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH is also extremely absent-minded, and I used to think the same thing  -<br/>\nthat if he really cared about something, he&#39;d remember.  And he&#39;d forget,<br/>\nand I&#39;d think he didn&#39;t care.  Having an oldest child who was also<br/>\nabsent-minded was one of the best things for that part of our marriage.  It<br/>\nmade us both realize that dh&#39;sabsent-mindedness wasn&#39;t something voluntary -<br/>\nit was just part of him.  And I relaxed about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I end up remembering many things for both of them - from volunteering to<br/>\nmy mother-in-law&#39;s birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My daughter is exactly the opposite - she&#39;s right on top of everything,<br/>\nalways ready early, and gets upset if there&#39;s any possiblity of being late.<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t want to be reminded abouth things (both dh and ds said that they<br/>\ndo), and neither do I - because I&#39;ve been thinking for the last 3 days that<br/>\nI have to do whatever it is, and trying to fit it in.  Usually by the time<br/>\ndh reminds me of something, it&#39;s been done for a week &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDd and I are both trying to learn how to relax a bit &lt;BWG&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6117,"nextTopicId":86588}}
