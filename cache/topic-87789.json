When people see my non-fiction <br/>\ncollection some of them say &quot;Have you READ all those books!?&quot;   No, I haven&#39;t <br/>\nread every word in every one.  Some I have twice.  Some I never intended to.  <br/>\nBut I know generally what&#39;s in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I see homeschooling info online as not just a non-fiction book but as <br/>\na river of information that&#39;s not going to stop flowing anytime soon.   Go <br/>\nonce in a while and take a dipper or a bucket or dangle your feet, but don&#39;t feel <br/>\nlike you failed because you couldn&#39;t save the whole river to examine it <br/>\ncarefully.  There will be more flowing tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you like best parts, there are still pools on info online too.   If <br/>\nyou just go to google.com and put in &quot;unschooling&quot; and whatever you&#39;re wondering <br/>\nabout, you&#39;ll find things to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, try &quot;homeschooling&quot; and your other topic, but that could net you a <br/>\nbunch of advertisements for things to buy about it.  Still, with google, it&#39;s <br/>\neasy to skim for something that looks good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s how I use my non-fiction books, is knowing generally what&#39;s <br/>\navailable in there, bookmarking my favorite parts, and learning how to use the index.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163132749,"authorName":"ivorygrace7@aol.com","from":"ivorygrace7@...","profile":"ivorygrace7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]Keeping up(was New...got a ?)","postDate":"1073230699","msgId":87789,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4LmEyNDU5YS4yZDI5OGQ2YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":87806,"prevInTime":87788,"nextInTime":87790,"topicId":87789,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/4/2004 9:26:14 AM Eastern Standard Time, mclean.w@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1893457250\">In a message dated 1/4/2004 9:26:14 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mclean.w@...\">mclean.w@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I love and want to read all of your experience and your <br/>\nopinions.

I think that&#39;s what is so good about <br/>\nit.  I&#39;ve only been on a short time, and I already feel like I know people <br/>\nhere.  I love all the discussion!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I don&#39;t read any mail for a day or especially for 2, I feel like I&#39;m <br/>\nbehind.  I try to check my mail for just a few minutes 2 or 3x a day.  This <br/>\nisn&#39;t always easy with 5 children who also want to use the internet frequently!  <br/>\nWe are looking at our budget with a goal of cable internet access by Spring <br/>\nwhich should speed things up a bit and allow us to stay on all the time.  (We <br/>\nhave certain times of day now that we have agreed not to use the internet so <br/>\nfamily and friends can call us.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think receiving email in digest really helps.  Then you have so much <br/>\nto read at once!  I would feel that was overwhelming, and the perfectionist <br/>\npart of me would probably want to read everything right away.  Sometimes I <br/>\ndelete items in threads that aren&#39;t of particular interest to me.  Sometimes I just <br/>\nskim things if I&#39;m in a hurry.  I also respond to fewer things if I&#39;m short <br/>\non time or if it&#39;s late.  I find that threads have a way of coming back, and if <br/>\nthere&#39;s something I really want to say, I can always say it later!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Jacqueline, who just added a lot more for you to read!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87721,"nextTopicId":87727}}
