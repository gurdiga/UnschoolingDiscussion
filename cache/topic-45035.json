They&#39;re all not even in the house right now.  Kirby&#39;s at <br/>\n  work, Marty&#39;s helping an adult friend of mine unload a truck (for money and <br/>\n  lunch!) and Holly&#39;s off riding bikes with another homeschooler.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m going to go read a magazine and feel sorry for myself and wish I had some <br/>\n  little kids to come wake me up from a nap.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45030,"nextTopicId":44917}}
