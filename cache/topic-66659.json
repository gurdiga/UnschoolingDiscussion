It&#39;s just <br/>\nme and Cait home for the most part all day so it&#39;s easier than if there were <br/>\nlittle children with lots of interests and things to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday she wanted to go get manicures and pedicures, it was easy to do on <br/>\nthe spur of the moment because it was only me and her that we have to <br/>\nconsider schedules for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the children and my nephew and his girlfriend and the children&#39;s <br/>\ngirlfriend/boyfriend and friends and the next door neighbors came over later <br/>\nfor a cook out and everyone just hung around and visited.  I didn&#39;t plan it <br/>\nbut it worked out OK since Cait and I had went to the market after the salon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe might think about doing something or going somewhere that takes some <br/>\nplanning, then we figure it out, but it is a very nice time in life to be <br/>\nable to spend this time so laid back with her just doing absolutely nothing <br/>\nor something planned or unplanned.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really is nice isn&#39;t it?
