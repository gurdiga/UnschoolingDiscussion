Luckily they have chosen alternate nights so I got to <br/>\nsleep Saturday and Monday nights after being up Friday and Sunday nights <br/>\nand being sick myself all day yesterday. Blech. The bright side is I caught <br/>\nup on my e-mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now a little rant.  Is it just me or are there a lot of plain-awful <br/>\nkids&#39; books out there?  I love our library system but it seems a lot of the <br/>\nbooks in there are stinkers.  Mostly it is the condescension I don&#39;t like <br/>\nand my kids see right though it as well. Some are trying too hard to teach <br/>\na lesson, such as word recognition or a certain value, some are just plain <br/>\nbad.  How do these get published? Luckily there are a fair number of good <br/>\nbooks. One of my favourites is Something From Nothing by Phoebe <br/>\nGilman.  The illustrations are beautiful. Rosemary Wells and her Max and <br/>\nRuby books are favourites, too. And Sheree Fitch&#39;s wonderfully rhythmic <br/>\npoems and stories. In the non-fiction I don&#39;t like the Usborne books that <br/>\nso many homeschoolers like.  I find them too busy. I like Dorling <br/>\nKindersley books, and the Eyewitness series. My ten-y.o. likes the cutaway <br/>\nbooks (they show objects, e.g. spacecraft, s if part of it was cut away so <br/>\nyou can see the workings), and any National Geographic book.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone recommend some good picture books for older children, around age <br/>\nseven?
