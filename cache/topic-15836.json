And a few other women have written <br/>\neloquently as to why making Roe vs. Wade illegal would be a bad thing.  That <br/>\nreason is because many (notice I said many, not all) of the people who call <br/>\nthemselves &quot;pro-life&quot; also do not believe in birth control.  Their only <br/>\n&quot;prevention&quot; for abortion is abstinence.  They fight to keep education out <br/>\nof the schools and they fight to close down Planned Parenthood&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem with this is that not everyone in this country is raised with the <br/>\nsame morals or values.  Not everyone in this country believes that sex is a <br/>\nsin and against the laws of God.  So, in order to have the choice whether or <br/>\nnot to engage in sexual behavior, the option and information of birth <br/>\ncontrol needs to be available.  Personally, I would rather see a woman use <br/>\nbirth control than have an abortion any day.  I would never have an abortion <br/>\nmyself, I did use birth control so that wouldn&#39;t have to be a choice I would <br/>\nhave to make.  And as someone else mentioned, sometimes that doesn&#39;t even <br/>\nprevent the necessity for abortion.  I don&#39;t remember who mentioned having <br/>\nto abort because of an IUD, but I applaud you for your honesty and thank you <br/>\nfor sharing your story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why I am pro-choice.  Until all women are educated and given access <br/>\nto birth control, abortion needs to be safe and legal.<br/>\n<br/>\nJMHO,<br/>\n<br/>\nBonnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:louisaem@...\">louisaem@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: choice/options<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sat, 3 Feb 2001 23:41:19 EST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 2/3/01 5:04:09 AM Pacific Standard Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ashling@...\">Ashling@...</a><br/>\n&gt;writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; The point is having the choice.
