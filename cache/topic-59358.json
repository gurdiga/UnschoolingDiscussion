She addresses car sickness and states that it is caused <br/>\nbecause &quot;information fed to the brain from the eyes and from the inner ear <br/>\nis out of synch.  In a car, passengers (especially those in the backseat) <br/>\nmay not be looking at the horizon ahead, so their eyes don&#39;t register the <br/>\nmovement even though the liquid in their inner ear is being stimulated by <br/>\nthe movement of the car.  The eyes tell the brain there is no movement, but <br/>\nthe inner ear relays the opposite message.   The conflicting information to <br/>\nthe brain results in nausea for those especially sensitive to the <br/>\nmismatched cues.&quot; (This may explain elevators....ear can tell movement, not <br/>\nthe eye...My daughter has severe ear canal scarring from ear infections and <br/>\ngets car sick, air sick and also doesn&#39;t like elevators)<br/>\n<br/>\nHer suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;1) Sit where there is an unobstructed view of the outside horizon: the <br/>\nfront seat is ideal.  Looking outside side windows is not as effective and <br/>\nmay exacerbate the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Never read or draw in the car.  It takes your gaze off the horizon, <br/>\ncausing the eyes to not measure movement, in opposition to the inner ear, <br/>\nwhich detects movement, resulting in nausea.  (See note below re videos <br/>\netc.  I think if you can get them really involved in something long term, <br/>\nversus short term like reading or drawing where they might be looking down <br/>\none minute and then up the next, that this may be a different case.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Roll the window down. [Fresh air will help]<br/>\n<br/>\n4). Stop regularly.  (She suggests up to every 10-15 minutes!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n5)  Eat a light meal before.  Avoid greasy, fatty, heavy foods and meals <br/>\nlike burgers and fries.  Try saltines or apple slices.  Popsicles may <br/>\nsoothe upset tummies.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Drink water.  Avoid acidic beverages like orange juice.  Sipping coke <br/>\nwill help settle the stomach--in fact, you can purchase straight Coke syrup <br/>\nfrom pharmacies for this purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Eliminate strong odors from the car environment as much as possible.  Do <br/>\nnot wear perfume in the car.  No smoking in the car.  Try to avoid <br/>\ncongested areas where car/truck/bus exhaust fumes are prevalent.<br/>\n<br/>\n8)  Try the wrist bands...(which you did)<br/>\n<br/>\n9)  Try over-the-counter motion sickness pills such as Dramamine or <br/>\nBonine.  Some cause drowsiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Try ginger.  Chinese sailors used ginger to quell sea sickness and <br/>\nscientists have confirmed its effectiveness.  Capsules with dried ginger <br/>\ninside or dried ginger chips can be purchased in health food <br/>\nstores.  Candied ginger, ginger snap cookies and real ginger ale have also <br/>\nbeen shown to be effective.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nActivities That Don&#39;t Make You Car Sick<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Listen to music<br/>\n<br/>\nListen to books and short stories on tape.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on games that require players to look out the window to find the <br/>\nfunniest, strangest, bluest (or whatever) bumper sticker, car, billboard, <br/>\nor some object.  Having fun while learning at the same time may help to <br/>\ntake some passengers&#39; minds off car sickness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSing songs<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay I Spy, 20 Questions, and other word/talking games.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(My daughter uses her personal CD player with her head phones, or we take <br/>\nalong our AC/DC 9&quot; color TV/VCR for the long trips with the headphones and <br/>\nthe kids (2) watch movies.  It has been the one thing she can do and not <br/>\nhave a problem.  Books on tape work marvelous for us too though, and keep <br/>\nthe driver entertained, especially the Harry Potter ones!)<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina Morrissey<br/>\nmom to Erin, 10 and Travis 14<br/>\nnorth of Seattle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Here is the short question: Any\r<br/>\nadvice on helping a 10yo kid with motion sickness tendencies better endure a\r<br/>\n4 hour car ride? We have tried Dramamine (sort of works, but puts her out\r<br/>\nand she HATES to take it); those bracelets that are worn on the wrist with\r<br/>\npressure points (didn&#39;t work); leave as late in the day as possible\r<br/>\n(definitely helps); eating just the right amount beforehand and having\r<br/>\ncertain snacks for the ride (helps somewhat). Reading doesn&#39;t help,\r<br/>\nlistening to stories on tape does.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere is some related stuff that I&#39;m thinking about. This same daughter\r<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to go in elevators. Not much of a problem, as there aren&#39;t\r<br/>\nvery many in our community, and the few that we do have are in short\r<br/>\nbuildings, so taking the stairs is a reasonable option. Dd told gramma (my\r<br/>\nmom) that she has a phobia about elevators. (Dd learned that a fear of\r<br/>\nsomething is called a phobia, and so she did use the term to refer to her\r<br/>\ndislike of elevators, but has certainly never been to a psychologist for\r<br/>\ndiagnosis of this!) My mom, who has a background in psychiatric nursing,\r<br/>\ntold me that I need to force her to go in elevators, because that is the\r<br/>\nonly way she will overcome this &quot;phobia&quot;. Allowing her to avoid elevators\r<br/>\nwill only make it worse, she says. My mom referred to her own &quot;phobia&quot; of\r<br/>\ndriving on the freeway. She avoided the freeway for years, until finally\r<br/>\nshe needed to go some places that were nearly impossible without freeway\r<br/>\ndriving. She drives the freeway regularly now, though she still is\r<br/>\nuncomfortable with it. I pointed out that when she finally wanted to bad\r<br/>\nenough, then she was able to do it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTonight at dinner, dh asked if we want to go with him this weekend to visit\r<br/>\nGramma, a 4 hour car ride. Lisa had tears in her eyes and said she doesn&#39;t\r<br/>\nlike the car ride. My recent conversation with my mom about the elevator\r<br/>\n&quot;phobia&quot; came to mind, even though I thought my moms concerns were\r<br/>\noverblown. Everyone else in the family would like to go on the trip. Lisa\r<br/>\nwould like to see Gramma, but doesn&#39;t want to have to go in the car to see\r<br/>\nher.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m willing to consider any thoughts that anyone is willing to share on this\r<br/>\nissue. She doesn&#39;t always get sick, but I know that trips are stressful for\r<br/>\nher because she does worry about it.
