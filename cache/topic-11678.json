I agree that labelling a so-called &quot;phase&quot; can sometimes be<br/>\ndetrimental.  I know the whole labelling thing in general is<br/>\ncounterproductive to children/people.  I just think it can be helpful to<br/>\nsometimes have a frame of reference to help identify some behaviors. <br/>\nWhen your child is on the verge of leaving babyhood and about to become<br/>\na full-fledged &quot;kid&quot;, of course the child is going to endure growing<br/>\npains of one form or another.  Before I really doubt myself as a mother<br/>\nand start listening to all kinds of rotten advice, (&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve just<br/>\nspoiled him...he should be weaned by now!&quot; or &quot;You&#39;ve been too soft, a<br/>\nfew swats with the wooden spoon would fix that noise&quot;...Believe me, this<br/>\nis what I&#39;ve heard!!!) it can be helpful to remind myself that this<br/>\nsometimes inconvenient behavior is typical and often short-lived.  My<br/>\ntwo year old won&#39;t be two forever, and this is just a &quot;phase&quot;.  With<br/>\npatience, consistency, and love it will pass.  I happen to believe the<br/>\nso-called &quot;terrible twos&quot; can also be the &quot;terrific twos&quot;.  There is so<br/>\nmuch wonder and magic at this age.  A two year old is actually capable<br/>\nof asking for a hug and giving you one back!  A two year old is just<br/>\nstarting to sing!  A two year old loves animals!  A two year old can be<br/>\nso social!  Mine have always been real entertainers...(BTW, my &quot;two year<br/>\nold&quot; phase usually starts at 18 months and is usually over with by 26<br/>\nmonths.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nPhases are transitional and not anything to take too seriously. <br/>\n&quot;Phases&quot; are not BEHAVIOURAL problems.  (Those are to be treated<br/>\ncompletely differently...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me re-state the obvious!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7724,"nextTopicId":11651}}
