This fellow Gordon<br/>\nNeufeld whose seminar I am taking is certainly influencing my thinking though<br/>\nalmost entirely in directions which I have already moved in.  Our experience in<br/>\nhis course is probably 90% confirmation of our existing practices and beliefs.<br/>\nThe 10% difference for me is very important though.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is vehemently opposed to time-outs as a method of discipline.  He believe it<br/>\nworks because it stimulates separation anxiety which works in the short term<br/>\nbut damages the attachment.  I think in the example of a child playing with the<br/>\ncord while someone is vacuuming is primarily a question of using distraction,<br/>\nrearranging the vacuuming so it is not an issue, questioning what the dangers<br/>\nreally are.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting &quot;obedience&quot; from a 1.5 year old is not really in the cards.  Of course<br/>\nyou stop a child from dangerous things but getting them to internalize such<br/>\nbehaviour at that age is not going to happen at least not every time.  You just<br/>\nhave to stop them from doing the thing one way or the other without resorting<br/>\nto using the attachment stuff as a weapon to force compliance.<br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially with sensitive children (most are) using the attachment in a fear<br/>\nengendering fashion results in children armouring themselves which then makes<br/>\nthe discipline process that much more difficult especially when the chickens<br/>\nall come home to roost in adolescence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I personally do not believe in eliciting apologies from children.  If they<br/>\nare sorry they can be helped to express it but if they are not it is an<br/>\nexercise in crazy-making. &quot;You tell your sister you are sorry.&quot; is a lie if you<br/>\naren&#39;t sorry at all and wish that your sister (at that moment) had never been<br/>\nborn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it is a challenge having a big for their age kid because everyone keeps<br/>\nexpecting behaviour that is not age appropriate because we all confuse size<br/>\nwith age.  I feel for these kids because sometime people are so unfair in their<br/>\nexpectations of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway the now christened (by me) Neufeld method emphasizing moving closer when<br/>\ndisciplining and minimizing separation.  When there is trouble get close.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to go on longer but gotta go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole subject is fascinating to me and helps me clarify what I believe<br/>\nwhich increases the likelihood that I will behave that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas and Nanci Kuykendall wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The power we have as parents is enormous but to use it to manipulate<br/>\n&gt; children is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the epitome of penny wise pound foolish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey Joel,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Could you elaborate a bit as to the harmful ways in which we manipulate our<br/>\n&gt; children?  I am in the throws of developing discipline practices that are<br/>\n&gt; successful for my toddler boys (20 months and 35 months) and will soon need<br/>\n&gt; to start all over again when our older adopted girl(or girls) come home, as<br/>\n&gt; I am positive they will be dealing with attachment, trust and abandonment<br/>\n&gt; issues, at the least.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I generally use time outs in his bedroom (2-5 min) for my almost three year<br/>\n&gt; old about once a day (on average, some days less some days more) for series<br/>\n&gt; problems like purposefully hurting his brother and refusing to apoloize,<br/>\n&gt; tantrums, refusing to desist in an activity despite numerous warnings, etc.<br/>\n&gt;  This usually has fairly good results, and is always followed up by a quiet<br/>\n&gt; lap conversation about the offending behavior and what he should have done,<br/>\n&gt; and often an apology to anyone who was hurt by his behavior (like brother,<br/>\n&gt; or me or Daddy.)  Usually he is raring to go and wants to run off and play<br/>\n&gt; afterward, but occassionally he needs calming after a tantrum and so I will<br/>\n&gt; cuddle with him and pet him and give him lots of reassurance for a while,<br/>\n&gt; until he is ready to get down and play.  I never strike my boys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Baby (1.5 yr. old) has only ever had three time outs, for about a<br/>\n&gt; minute each, for purposefully pushing and disobeying in a dangerous<br/>\n&gt; situation after numerous warnings (like playing with the electrical cord<br/>\n&gt; while Daddy is vacuming) but he is generally really easy.  I try not to<br/>\n&gt; even raise my voice with him, as he is so sensastive that it usually makes<br/>\n&gt; him cry if I look or sound cross.  I try to make things into a game and use<br/>\n&gt; humor to teach him, as he does not get upset and is much more receptive to<br/>\n&gt; that.  He has a very gentle personality and does not respond well to<br/>\n&gt; agression, and also cries when his brother gets too rough in play (a<br/>\n&gt; frequent problem, with my rough and tumble, sports loving older boy!)  We<br/>\n&gt; refer to our &quot;little&quot; guy as our gentle giant, because he is so very<br/>\n&gt; gentle, and quiet but he is the same size as his brother and both wear size<br/>\n&gt; 2 or 3 clothes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On a side note, he has a really interesting personality.  Even though he is<br/>\n&gt; shy, people are attracted to him in an irresistable way.  My older son is a<br/>\n&gt; BIG flirt and has a magnetic personality, dimples, red hair and blue eyes<br/>\n&gt; with long thick lashes.  I KNOW why people are drawn to him, he is cute and<br/>\n&gt; talks incessently to everyone and is not the least bit shy.  His brother,<br/>\n&gt; however, is shy and hides from strangers (although he has recently started<br/>\n&gt; waving and saying &quot;Hi&quot; to people) but he has the most amazing affect on<br/>\n&gt; people.  Everyone he meets wants to hold him and kiss him and he has this<br/>\n&gt; incredible calming effect on them.  People have described feeling washed<br/>\n&gt; over with peace when they hold him.  When he was an infant, everyone who<br/>\n&gt; held him fell asleep!  It makes me wonder about him, his purpose, or since<br/>\n&gt; I believe in reincarnation, I wonder if he has previously been some kind of<br/>\n&gt; a healer.  I look forward to seeing who he will grow to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nanci K. in Idaho<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nbest wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a wonderful gift possibility and to support a great cause check out:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html\">http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.
