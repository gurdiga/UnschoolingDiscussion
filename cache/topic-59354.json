But a mound<br/>\nof snow caving in and suffocating a small child is a very real concern,<br/>\nand IMO the man was just being thoughtful, seeing a young child doing<br/>\nsomething potentially dangerous without an adult near, most likely not<br/>\nknowing that you were watching out the window. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer my dd&#39;s 7yo neighbor friend was playing out in a newly tilled<br/>\nfarmers field after a few days of rain. They often play adventure games<br/>\nand stuff, like pretending to be stuck and such, and when I looked out at<br/>\nthe field (about 900 feet away) dd&#39;s friend was waving her arms in the<br/>\nair. I wasn&#39;t sure what to think, and I surely didn&#39;t want to disturb<br/>\nthem in the midst of their imaginary game, but I wasn&#39;t comfortable with<br/>\nwhat I saw. At the risk of destroying their game, I ran over to see what<br/>\nwas up. Thank God I did, because Jace was up to her waist in mud, the dog<br/>\nwas stuck, and my dd was trying to pull her out only to get herself<br/>\nstuck. I got everybody out, lost a shoe, and learned an important lesson<br/>\nabout mud. If I wasn&#39;t there, I surely would have hoped that an adult<br/>\npassing by would have aided them, or better yet, said, &quot;Hi girls, you<br/>\nknow that mud gets like quicksand after a day of rain. Be careful.&quot;<br/>\nbefore it happened.<br/>\nHindsight is 20/20.<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111148946,"authorName":"lonskids247 &lt;lonskids247@yahoo.com&gt;","from":"&quot;lonskids247 &lt;lonskids247@...&gt;&quot; &lt;lonskids247@...&gt;","profile":"lonskids247","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: snow day and thanks","postDate":"1045683975","msgId":59359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIzMG11NytsN3UxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY2NmJBaVFUVzdodVY3TDdsU20wMDAwZmE0M0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59354,"nextInTopic":59361,"prevInTime":59358,"nextInTime":59360,"topicId":59354,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sorry that guy wrecked the fun and made your girl cry.

I knew a kid in school whose cousin died in <br/>\none that collapsed on him. (It&#39;s the first place I remember hearing <br/>\nthe phrase &quot;freak accident&quot;.) Just one shovel full of snow is dang <br/>\nheavy. Imagine half a fort&#39;s worth of snow on top of a little kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing that, we make them in snow piles by digging a hole down in <br/>\nfrom the top, sort of volcano style. Then we make little short <br/>\ntunnels going out of it closer, to the top...usually a very short  <br/>\nsliding tunnel is what they like to make. It&#39;s not the same but it&#39;s <br/>\nstill really fun! They also dig little cubby holes on the inside <br/>\nwalls for &quot;storing food&quot; and to put jar candles in if they want to. <br/>\nPainting the outside with colored water is one more way to enjoy <br/>\ntheir new home too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;karyn Korins-Boyd&quot; <br/>\n&lt;karynbkb@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On another note: we got 26 inches of snow last night.
