We had so many people that were from<br/>\ndifferent time zones plus we had so little time with each other that no one<br/>\nwanted to go to sleep.  The adults were kicked out of the pool area at 11:00<br/>\nand the kids kept getting kicked out of places all night long.  We<br/>\ndefinately need two hang out rooms, one for the adults and one for the kids<br/>\nthat can stay awake that long.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79374,"nextTopicId":79392}}
