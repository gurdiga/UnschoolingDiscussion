She says she takes back all the worries and she had and is quite impressed with what she sees Dana do.  Mind you, we still do not have &quot;formal&quot; lessons.  If Dana wants a workbook, I buy one, if she wants me to print out worksheets I do, and she will do 30-40 at a time - asking me questions when needed.  This is truly a wonderful experience we are having and I wouldn&#39;t change it for the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, the inlaws still don&#39;t get it, but they aren&#39;t worthy of my concern =) that&#39;s a whole other not worth repeating story.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie, can&#39;t wait for the book.  Laurie, you should tour unschooling conventions and seminars!  To all others, thank you for being here, you have been my rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith warmest regards, <br/>\nKaren Mowery<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20235,"nextTopicId":20352}}
