They were the &quot;sit down and shut up&quot; types <br/>\nand they were some of the rare (in my experience) spankers without any religion. <br/>\n Maybe they had religious grandparents expecting it, though, or maybe they <br/>\nwere just spiteful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If my child is doing something unkind or dishonest or hostile or <br/>\nwhatever - something that is causing another kid problems - I want to <br/>\nknow about it and I would not consider it &quot;tattling&quot; if another kid or <br/>\nparent let me know.

You don&#39;t want to feed a new <br/>\nargument.  <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Divide and conquer.<br/>\nUse bright-yellow-and-black caution tape ($7 from www.duct-tape.com) to <br/>\ndivide their play space, and tell them they can&#39;t cross to the other one&#39;s side of <br/>\nthe room. Make believe you&#39;re arriving at the scene of a crime and the giggles <br/>\nshould help them forget what they were fighting about. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Let them work it out.<br/>\nAsk them to do something that&#39;ll make them gang up on you. Picking up toys or <br/>\nsome other much-hated chore should do the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you could just stop listening in and worrying.
