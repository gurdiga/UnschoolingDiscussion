And ran into this with my youngest, 6 yrs, at Christmas time.  He <br/>\nwanted an Egyptian statue.  He was crying almost hysterical.  It was real <br/>\nlate.  We were all hungry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took him to a quiet corner of the store and explained that we just didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the money and that I would help him to earn some money and we would save <br/>\nsome and come back another day to get the statue.  He was still hysterical.  <br/>\nI picked him up and gave him a big hug.  Still crying.  Carried him out of <br/>\nthe store, he calmed a little.  Held him while we drove and let him pick out <br/>\na restaurant.  Feeling better with some food in his tummy we drove home and <br/>\nwent back 2 weeks later and he got the statue.  <br/>\nI never lie to the boys and always try to help them understand the situation <br/>\nand offer some ways to get what they want and always follow through.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64445,"nextTopicId":64235}}
