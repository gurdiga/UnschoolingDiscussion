Her sister Phoenix,<br/>\nten years younger, has been a very different<br/>\nexperience.  As I&#39;ve said, I answer every question,<br/>\nkeep resources available, and help in the pursuit of<br/>\nnew information or skills when requested.  Phoenix was<br/>\nreading and writing her name and a few very short<br/>\nwords at age two, with Carrie and I each teaching her,<br/>\nat her own request.  Grocery shopping was fun because<br/>\nof all the &quot;double-takes&quot; as Phoenix, again at age<br/>\ntwo, walked along proudly reading the number of each<br/>\naisle.  When we tried public school at third grade,<br/>\nPhoenix was tested for placement.  Her scores ranged<br/>\nfrom third grade to high school level in the various<br/>\nareas.  The counselor who tested her scolded me for<br/>\nnot keeping all areas on the same level of<br/>\nproficiency.  Her lowest score, in case you are<br/>\ncurious, was in math.  She doesn&#39;t like math on paper,<br/>\nbut is brilliant with theoretic and practical math<br/>\nconcepts.  As I have mentioned, our relationship with<br/>\nthe public school system ended after three days.  I<br/>\ndid write to the state board of education about the<br/>\ndifficulties encountered there, never heard back from<br/>\nthem, but was called by the school principal a month<br/>\nlater.  She offered to enroll Phoenix in school again<br/>\nunder any circumstances I might dictate, but I told<br/>\nher I was not interested.  I just worked harder at<br/>\nmaintaining Phoenix&#39;s safety and comfort in various<br/>\nways while I worked a five-minute walk from home, and<br/>\nhave continued homeschooling / unschooling weekends<br/>\nand other odd hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that both girls have been a breath-taking<br/>\ndelight and at times a heart-crushing ache.  Both are<br/>\nfascinating, both love to learn new things, both<br/>\nunderstand their own and each other&#39;s mental<br/>\nprocesses.  Both appreciate their own and each other&#39;s<br/>\nuniqueness.  <br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nDiana<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29732,"nextTopicId":29736}}
