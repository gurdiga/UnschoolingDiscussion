It has to do<br/>\n&gt; with the kids constructing their own learning by alays building on what<br/>\n&gt; they already know - but with the help of &quot;scaffolding&quot; so that they can<br/>\n&gt; extend themselves - to do things that are otherwise JUST outside their<br/>\n&gt; own reach.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Scaffolding could be an adult there to talk things through with or to<br/>\n&gt; offer to drive the kid to the hardware store or library or wherever. It<br/>\n&gt; could be making sure they have the supplies they need. Lots of it would<br/>\n&gt; most likely be conversation, transportation, and access to resouces.

It has to do <br/>\nwith the kids constructing their own learning by alays building on what <br/>\nthey already know - but with the help of &quot;scaffolding&quot; so that they can <br/>\nextend themselves - to do things that are otherwise JUST outside their <br/>\nown reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nScaffolding could be an adult there to talk things through with or to <br/>\noffer to drive the kid to the hardware store or library or wherever. It <br/>\ncould be making sure they have the supplies they need. Lots of it would <br/>\nmost likely be conversation, transportation, and access to resouces. I <br/>\nthink it is the part of unschooling that gets sort of &quot;left out&quot; of the <br/>\ndefinition when we say, &quot;We don&#39;t do school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could say, &quot;We provide the scaffolding that supports our kids in <br/>\nlearning what they want to learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn schools, this is a big deal because the question of how you can <br/>\nprovide that &quot;scaffolding&quot; when you have one teacher and 30 kids - is <br/>\ndifficult to answer. But as unschoolers, &quot;scaffolding&quot; is what we do <br/>\nwhen we say we &quot;support our kids&#39; interests.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 17, 2005, at 4:50 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in what it is.
