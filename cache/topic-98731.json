That&#39;s about how<br/>\nlong it takes for ours to get so gross I don&#39;t even<br/>\nwant to lay on it and am embarressed to have other<br/>\nkids play on it.  With a cheap carpet cleaning, it&#39;s<br/>\nsuprising how brand new clean it gets!  4.) Throw an<br/>\narea rug on top of it or a blanket.  Dirty carpet? <br/>\nWhat dirty carpet?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look around and see our stained, dirty, pee<br/>\nsmelling carpet (mmm...) and pencil, paint, markered<br/>\nup walls I am glad that we are just renting!  But,<br/>\ncarpets can be cleaned, and walls can be washed.  When<br/>\nbuying art supplies, I try to get the washable Crayola<br/>\nbrand as it comes off the walls (and other surfaces)<br/>\nsuprisingly easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I do spend a fair amount of time hunched over a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;puddle of pee on the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;carpet,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and that drives me nuts.

Below I&#39;ve made<br/>\nsome comments within your quotes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;There is the near-constant bickering <br/>\n&gt;&gt;and fighting that I&#39;ve mentioned before.  They hit<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and kick each other.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like a lot of pent up emotion.  Do they see<br/>\nother people hitting and kicking each other?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The 3yo does this for no apparent reason. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure there is a very good reason.  Perhaps she<br/>\nneeds more one on one attention from you and/or her<br/>\nfather.  Perhaps she still has a lot of jealousy<br/>\nsurrounding her 1 year old sibling and/or possibly her<br/>\nolder sibling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If I remove her from the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;scene, she yells screams and stomps her feet andthen<br/>\n&gt;&gt;when she finally <br/>\n&gt;&gt;calms down 15-20 minutes later and lets me hold her<br/>\n&gt;&gt;and care for her a bit, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe this is exactly what she needs.  Perhaps try<br/>\nholding and &#39;caring&#39; for her before she reaches this<br/>\npoint of acting out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The baby (1yo) pulls <br/>\n&gt;&gt;everyones hair and scratches and bites and pinches<br/>\n&gt;&gt;when he is thwarted in any <br/>\n&gt;&gt;way (and sometimes for no apparent reason he&#39;ll just<br/>\n&gt;&gt;run over and hurt <br/>\n&gt;&gt;one of the girls when they are watching something on<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tv)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seems like the 1 year old is trying to communicate and<br/>\nget attention.  And, this seems to work.  Perhaps try<br/>\ngiving more attention to the 1 year old and clueing<br/>\ninto times that might make him/her do these hurtful<br/>\nactions; thus, possibly preventing them.  Have you<br/>\nthought about doing sign language with her?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the t.v. thing:  Try looking more positively about<br/>\nit.  Take advantage of it.  You get a break, right? <br/>\nRelax.  Do something nearby that you want to do. (I<br/>\nthink this may have already been said.)  Your children<br/>\nare already adjusting to a new move, right?  And their<br/>\ndad is gone A LOT, right?  They probably find comfort<br/>\nin watching tv.  Is it really the tv that makes you<br/>\ndepressed?  Seems like there are alot of other factors<br/>\nthat are probably contributing like financial stuff,<br/>\nno help with the kids most of the week, having an<br/>\n&#39;absent&#39; partner and having 3 kids aged 4 and under<br/>\nwould be enough in itself to throw me over the top! <br/>\nWow!  Please hang in there, go easy on yourself.  Do<br/>\nyou have any home movies that ya&#39;ll could watch?  My 3<br/>\nyear old and 1 year old love to watch these and see<br/>\nthemselves and their friends on tv.  Then, they could<br/>\nsee dad on tv too!  Maybe make a home video just for<br/>\nthis.  If you don&#39;t own a recorder, maybe borrow one<br/>\nfrom someone who does!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I want to cry (and often do) everyday out of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;frustration with dealing <br/>\n&gt;&gt;with my children.  I feel guilty for getting so<br/>\n&gt;&gt;frustrated that yell and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;slam cabinets on occasion.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like you may not only be stressed, depressed<br/>\nand overwhelmed, but you may also have some post<br/>\npartum depression.  Can you try to start a playgroup? <br/>\nAre there any childrens or mom&#39;s groups in town?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;(Since I sat down <br/>\n&gt;&gt;in desperation to write this<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like you desperately needed to cry out for<br/>\nhelp.  And I&#39;m glad you did.  I think many moms hold<br/>\nit all in and think they are the only ones having such<br/>\na challenging time.  It must also be really hard<br/>\nhaving just moved to a new place.  It&#39;s not always<br/>\neasy or quick to make new friends.  Keep your chin up<br/>\nand keep plodding along.  Things should get better! <br/>\nRight now just be with your kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Then they all wanted a movie, even though I had<br/>\n&gt;&gt;offered <br/>\n&gt;&gt;both the beach and to make plaster of paris<br/>\n&gt;&gt;creatures using balloons and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;then painting them with acrylic paint.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe if you just start a project one of the kids may<br/>\njoin you; and if not, at least you can enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;4 yo says she is full and leaves the table full of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;uneaten <br/>\n&gt;&gt;apple wedges<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, I&#39;ve been here.  And, a previous poster commented<br/>\nthat you were prioritizing the apple above your child<br/>\nat that moment.  I agree.  You said that was too<br/>\nsimplistic.  But, it doesn&#39;t have to be complicated. <br/>\nSimple is good.  Perhaps you are trying to make things<br/>\nmore complicated than they need to be.  I have been<br/>\ndissapointed when my son didn&#39;t touch his apple wedges<br/>\nand apple butter that I prepared for him.  Unknowing<br/>\nto him, it was the last apple and I knew how little<br/>\nfood we had in the house and no money to buy more<br/>\ngroceries for a while.  So, although it was<br/>\nfrustrating, I just wrapped it up and put it in the<br/>\nfridge.  I guess he really just didn&#39;t need it!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I held her <br/>\n&gt;&gt;firmly by the arms and said, &quot;Enough!  I don&#39;t like<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to be screamed at.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;She started crying and stomping her feet and finally<br/>\n&gt;&gt;went off to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could all this whining and screaming and crying that<br/>\nyour children do be a result of seeing you do this? <br/>\nOne thing I learned from my partner who does crisis<br/>\nintervention is when someone is screaming etc. to<br/>\nreply/talk to them in a soft, quieter, lower voice<br/>\nthan them.  This brings the noise level and hopefully<br/>\nthe tension/stress level down.  Might be worth a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea,  I hope you can really find some time to relax<br/>\nand go easy on yourself.  Not that I am suggesting you<br/>\nwould do this, but when I read in the paper of mothers<br/>\nwho kill or abuse their children, it seems that they<br/>\nhave quite a few young children, and my personal take<br/>\non it is not that they&#39;re insane, but just totally<br/>\nstressed out!!  Our society/government could be a lot<br/>\nmore supportive of mothers and children.  Instead,<br/>\nwe&#39;re expected to do it all on our own despite the<br/>\nfact that alot of families only have one working<br/>\npartner, we have to pay for health insurance if we can<br/>\nafford it, and struggle to feed our families.  You&#39;re<br/>\ndoing a good job!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\nJennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
