Perhaps<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; most hotly debated aspect of the program has to do with the Ezzos&#39; views<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; routines for young children. BABYWISE admonishes parents to establish a<br/>\n&gt; regular schedule for infants immediately after birth; they propose that an<br/>\n&gt; unscheduled baby will lead to an undisciplined and difficult child with<br/>\n&gt; &quot;metabolic chaos&quot; (a term not found in any medical literature). In the<br/>\n&gt; religious version of the manual, the Ezzos strongly suggest that it is<br/>\nGod&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; will that infants eat, sleep, and play on an externally imposed schedule.<br/>\n&gt; They write that God is a &quot;God of order.&quot; In fact, the subtitle of their<br/>\n&gt; parenting curriculum is &quot;Growing Kids God&#39;s Way.&quot; The book insists that<br/>\n&gt; scheduling an infant will actually help his nervous system to &quot;mature&quot;<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; quickly. In BABYWISE, the Ezzos advocate something they refer to as<br/>\n&gt; &quot;parent-directed feeding,&quot; in which infants, whether breast- or<br/>\nbottle-fed,<br/>\n&gt; should be offered nourishment only every three hours or so as timed by the<br/>\n&gt; parents. In earlier versions of the manual, parents were urged to wait at<br/>\n&gt; least four hours between feedings. After vociferous outcry from the<br/>\nmedical<br/>\n&gt; community, the guidelines were modified. Still, according to BABYWISE,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;demand feeding,&quot; the method currently advocated for infants by all major<br/>\n&gt; medical organizations, is a faddish and child-centered practice that can<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; lead to unhappy babies and mothers. Both GFI infant-care manuals advise<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; demand-fed infants often grow into children who steal, who will be unable<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; handle real life, and who will &quot;have difficulty with siblings and peers.&quot;<br/>\nDr.<br/>\n&gt; Robert Bucknam, the Denver-area pediatrician who co-authored BABYWISE with<br/>\n&gt; the Ezzos, describes this alleged phenomenon: &quot;As they get older,&quot; said<br/>\n&gt; Bucknam, &quot;every whine is an opportunity to feed. They become more<br/>\ndemanding.<br/>\n&gt; They become brats.&quot; Most child-health experts couldn&#39;t disagree more<br/>\nstrongly<br/>\n&gt; ....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;In an interview with the Bradenton Herald (of Florida), Kearney discussed<br/>\n&gt; the experiences she had working with a number of parents who were using<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Ezzo feeding program. In each case, babies were gaining weight slowly and<br/>\n&gt; exhibiting signs of depression. Despite Kearney&#39;s professional advice to<br/>\nfeed<br/>\n&gt; the babies more often, these parents refused in accordance with the<br/>\nBABYWISE<br/>\n&gt; schedule.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestfed.com/katie/ezzos.htm\">http://www.bestfed.com/katie/ezzos.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Perhaps the <br/>\nmost hotly debated aspect of the program has to do with the Ezzos&#39; views on <br/>\nroutines for young children. BABYWISE admonishes parents to establish a <br/>\nregular schedule for infants immediately after birth; they propose that an <br/>\nunscheduled baby will lead to an undisciplined and difficult child with <br/>\n&quot;metabolic chaos&quot; (a term not found in any medical literature). In the <br/>\nreligious version of the manual, the Ezzos strongly suggest that it is God&#39;s <br/>\nwill that infants eat, sleep, and play on an externally imposed schedule. <br/>\nThey write that God is a &quot;God of order.&quot; In fact, the subtitle of their <br/>\nparenting curriculum is &quot;Growing Kids God&#39;s Way.&quot; The book insists that <br/>\nscheduling an infant will actually help his nervous system to &quot;mature&quot; more <br/>\nquickly. In BABYWISE, the Ezzos advocate something they refer to as <br/>\n&quot;parent-directed feeding,&quot; in which infants, whether breast- or bottle-fed, <br/>\nshould be offered nourishment only every three hours or so as timed by the <br/>\nparents. In earlier versions of the manual, parents were urged to wait at <br/>\nleast four hours between feedings. After vociferous outcry from the medical <br/>\ncommunity, the guidelines were modified. Still, according to BABYWISE, <br/>\n&quot;demand feeding,&quot; the method currently advocated for infants by all major <br/>\nmedical organizations, is a faddish and child-centered practice that can only <br/>\nlead to unhappy babies and mothers. Both GFI infant-care manuals advise that <br/>\ndemand-fed infants often grow into children who steal, who will be unable to <br/>\nhandle real life, and who will &quot;have difficulty with siblings and peers.&quot; Dr. <br/>\nRobert Bucknam, the Denver-area pediatrician who co-authored BABYWISE with <br/>\nthe Ezzos, describes this alleged phenomenon: &quot;As they get older,&quot; said <br/>\nBucknam, &quot;every whine is an opportunity to feed. They become more demanding. <br/>\nThey become brats.&quot; Most child-health experts couldn&#39;t disagree more strongly<br/>\n....<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In an interview with the Bradenton Herald (of Florida), Kearney discussed <br/>\nthe experiences she had working with a number of parents who were using the <br/>\nEzzo feeding program. In each case, babies were gaining weight slowly and <br/>\nexhibiting signs of depression. Despite Kearney&#39;s professional advice to feed <br/>\nthe babies more often, these parents refused in accordance with the BABYWISE <br/>\nschedule.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bestfed.com/katie/ezzos.htm\">http://www.bestfed.com/katie/ezzos.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Johanna SanInocencio","from":"&quot;Johanna SanInocencio&quot; &lt;saninocencio@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cmdr_Xz99peE7YkHeC9zXn5jPiJOcvilIMmnvksr7lC1P8sm9k16hj2YknKz3qFNBqX5lM65w-H4vQuY506LZ_yOf091iNodoUP8uH3M592Djuv7bi0rLNKd9w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1418","postDate":"999981234","msgId":24661,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWMxMzhhNSQ5NGVlNzdhMCQ4YmQ3OWJjZUBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTA4LjA5NTQ1My4tNzYwNTEzLjE5LnJ1bXBsZXRlYXNlcm1vbUBqdW5vLmNvbT4gPDAxMWEwMWMxMzg4ZCQ4OTMyM2UwMCRhZjVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+"},"prevInTopic":24617,"nextInTopic":24697,"prevInTime":24660,"nextInTime":24662,"topicId":24379,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ezzo?

Jenni will<br/>\nread while walking.  Some of them are developmental issues that would<br/>\ntake a long time to explain here but I&#39;ll hunt down the data if you are<br/>\ninterested.  Some of the reasons have to do with content.  Jenni is<br/>\ngetting way more from her books than Wyndham is from his TV.  If he were<br/>\nwatching a better quality of TV it might not be as bad but even then the<br/>\nother factors are still there.   And then there is the fact that Wyndham<br/>\nhas some behavioral issues that are made worse by inactivity.  That alone<br/>\nwould be enough to make me limit his viewing.<br/>\nI will discourage Game Boy usage if the quantity is too high also.  But<br/>\nthat again is a health issue.
