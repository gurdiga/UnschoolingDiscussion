I would do all you could to stay <br/>\nfocused on why you are doing this and to hang tough with it.  My son also <br/>\nwent through this at age 11.  He absolutely loves it now and I am glad that I <br/>\nhung tough.  I also bought a book called Christian Unschooling and asked him <br/>\nto read some.  There is another called The Unschooling Handbook.  I think if <br/>\nthey realized what it meant to unschool, they would love to continue.  But, I <br/>\nwould hang tough as say that you are going to continue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI got my son very involved in theatre and dance and singing.  For him, it was <br/>\na way to be around others but really only 1-2 days a week.  He auditioned for <br/>\nhis first play at Christmas and got the lead.  I think you should really look <br/>\nat their interests and find, right now, ways to get them involved.  They will <br/>\nmeet others this way too.  Try to find other unschoolers they can become <br/>\nfriends with...hard to do sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62153152,"authorName":"truealaskans","from":"&quot;truealaskans&quot; &lt;truealaskans@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"My kids say they want to go back to public school","postDate":"1022872485","msgId":37994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNTMxMTMxNC5BQTI1MDM0OTI2QGVtYWlsLnBsYXRlYXV0ZWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37995,"prevInTime":37993,"nextInTime":37995,"topicId":37994,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have any of you ever had one of your kids decide that they wanted to go back to public school?

My almost 14 yo ds decided that he is going to go back to ps to start high school this fall. My 11 yo ds was saying that he wanted to stay at home, but all of a sudden he is saying that he wants to try ps out again this fall also. We have just moved to a new state so that might have something to do with it. Also, I think my 11 ds is saying that he wants to go back just because the older one is. We only recently started trying the unschooling approach. It was wonderful, especially with my 11 yo. I was really looking forward to all the fun stuff we could do together this fall while other kids were stuck in school. I am not sure how I should handle this.
