At first, while we were <br/>\nswimming during the last warm days of September or the first warm <br/>\ndays of May, or while we were wandering an empty zoo during October, <br/>\nor seeing the Christmas decorations during an uncrowded weekday in <br/>\nDecember, I would remind her that if she were going to &quot;regular&quot; <br/>\nschool, she wouldn&#39;t be able to enjoy this.  &quot;Just think of your poor <br/>\nfriends sitting at a desk in a school right now.&quot; I would say.  That <br/>\nseemed to pacify her for a while, but then she would start asking <br/>\nabout going to school again.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast summer I signed her up for a week long course, mornings only, at <br/>\nmy alma mater, Alverno, which was described as &quot;Harry Potter Wacky <br/>\nWizardry&quot; school.  She&#39;s a nut about Harry Potter and had enough Harry <br/>\nPotter outfits for all five days.  The first day she went with her <br/>\nHarry Potter backpack filled with a wizard&#39;s robe and hat and some <br/>\nBertie Botts every flavored beans we had bought at a novelty store. <br/>\nShe never opened it. The class turned out to be a kitchen science <br/>\nclass, all the home type of experiments that we&#39;d already done many <br/>\ntimes as unschoolers.  Only one other child had a Harry Potter shirt <br/>\non and so did the teacher.  When I got to class to pick her up I got <br/>\nto listen to the teacher droning on about what they would be doing <br/>\ntomorrow (if she didn&#39;t forget any of the equipment like she had <br/>\ntoday) while they sat quietly in their places, in a hot <br/>\nunairconditioned room waiting for today to be finished.  By <br/>\nWednesday she chose not to wear a Harry Potter outfit, as no one else <br/>\nwas and that evening she asked if she could not go anymore, but I <br/>\nconvinced her to try one more day.  If she had really copped a fit, I <br/>\nwould have let her quit, but I wanted her to get a good taste of the <br/>\ntedium of every day, every day, same old, same old.  She managed to <br/>\nfinish the entire week of the program and was pleased with herself for <br/>\nfinishing, but is now very glad that she never has to go to school.

Kirby didn&#39;t do so well (socially and behaiorally) in a dance class <br/>\nhe REALLY wanted to take when he was five (where they were super strict and <br/>\nhe cried), and in an art class (where they loved him but he didn&#39;t follow <br/>\ndirections well at all, so he was disruptive).  Those made it easier for both <br/>\nof us to forget about kindergarten for a while (which turned into ten years <br/>\nand counting).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever decision you make today could keep changing, but if you spend the <br/>\nremaining &quot;free pre-school time&quot; letting him dabble in stuff you&#39;ll have a <br/>\nbetter basis for decision, and more than your own personal fears and <br/>\nthoughts--you&#39;ll have evidence, and he&#39;ll have different motivations in a <br/>\nyear than now.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of things which have helped us and other families:  lunch boxes and <br/>\nbus rides.<br/>\n<br/>\nPacking a lunch in a school lunchbox and going to the park can be fun.   Some <br/>\npark-and-ride events use school buses here, and so the kids got to be in a <br/>\nschool bus.  Riding the city bus a couple of times put a fear of buses into <br/>\nthem for a while.  You have time to de-mystify some things.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing to plays or concerts at elementaries might help too.  We&#39;ve done that <br/>\nwhen friends&#39; kids were performing, and my kids were surprised at the vast <br/>\nnumbers of kids seated in rows and told to shush, don&#39;t wiggle, pay <br/>\nattention.

I think it is important to make the decision <br/>\nnow, not a year from now.  I think having all the friends for your kids is <br/>\nvery important, and to work on exposing them to different things in and out <br/>\nof the home.  Create an environment at home that gives them places to play.  <br/>\nAll you need to be thinking about is what all of you can do together.
