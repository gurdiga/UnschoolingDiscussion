For example, a parent might <br/>\ntell a child that he needs antibiotics and make the child take the <br/>\nmedicine, when the antibiotic really wasn&#39;t a very healthy thing for <br/>\nher body. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree. A lot of the time it&#39;s plain ingnorance about alternatives. Even unschoolers can be very mainstream when it comes to health care...  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI let my dd choose what she wants to eat, and have done it ever since she was born. She was breastfed on demand and then when she started eating solid food, she would go for only rice or broccoli or whatever. I&#39;ve never pressured her about any of that, because I totally trust her inner inteligence.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; There might be times when a child is more in tune with her instincts <br/>\nthan a parent, yet is forced to do what the parent thinks is needed. <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what the answer is, except for encouraging parents to be <br/>\nhealthy and in tune with their own instincts. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you here. I think that they are totally in tune with their instincts when it comes to instinctual stuff, but when it comes to mind stuff it gets a bit more tricky...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; And of course the same <br/>\nconcept applies to what tv shows we let our kids watch.  The child <br/>\nmight be more in tune with his own instincts than the parent is.  The <br/>\nchild might be right and the parent might be wrong. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where I am not so sure. I think kids are extremely impressionable and tend to believe that what&#39;s out there is *normal*. Yet I don&#39;t think that most of what&#39;s out there is natural or normal at all! I don&#39;t think playing with guns is going to make a kid violent, but I do believe that watching someone spanking or hitting a kid may leave a disturbing impression on them, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We don&#39;t tell him that he&#39;s being treated for that.  And I know she&#39;s <br/>\ntaking into account other things--like that he&#39;s sensitive to smells <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t like to wear jeans and more that she hasn&#39;t even told me <br/>\nI&#39;m sure. Right now I hold him, she dumps them into his mouth and <br/>\nholds it shut until she thinks it&#39;s been in long enough, then we let <br/>\nhim go and he spits them out. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever asked him why he spits it out? There&#39;s cases when people fear they&#39;re being poisoned (and that&#39;s a rubric for the homeopath), but he may have other reasons. I won&#39;t say anymore. I was personally (privately)  asked not to talk about homeopathy on these lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think that there is really a difference between trusting them <br/>\nto know what&#39;s good for them physically and what&#39;s good for them <br/>\nmorally/emotionally. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s where I have my doubts. Not because I don&#39;t *trust* but because I know how impressonable we humans are. Perhaps it&#39;s just a question of good timing, and as they grow up they get more and more exposure to things (just like more choices, responsibilities, etc.). <br/>\n       <br/>\n&lt;&lt; Even if porn doesn&#39;t become an obsession, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to <br/>\nwatch porn even occasionally.  Beyond that possible first time seeing <br/>\nit, asking what it is, and then discussing why it isn&#39;t healthy, I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want my kids watching it at all.  I just don&#39;t believe it&#39;s <br/>\na good moral thing for anyone to watch.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a big one for me too.

But he still has some little things, and the biggest one seems <br/>\nto be being uncomfortable away from home. I&#39;m not sure what his <br/>\nremedy is at this point.  At one point he was cal carb, but I think <br/>\nshe changed it at some point. Maybe lycopodium?  Or maybe that was my <br/>\nother son--I&#39;m not sure.

When do we let go? &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve made my girl brush her teeth ever since she was very little and now it&#39;s simply a habit. Same thing with her hair and personal hygiene. We all do those tings here, so it&#39;s not like something extraordinary, just for her. She knows why and she is willing to do it. I don&#39;t have to *force* her. I understand that unschooling is about trusting and letting kids lead their learning process, but they still need parenting, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; At some point I think all parents would step in and say, &quot;I am going <br/>\nto take care of your needs whether you like it or not&quot;. &gt;&gt; Totally. I understand there are ways of doing it and ways of doing it, of course. So I try to make those things fun. I truly believe that my daughter needs me as her mother and not just *a buddy* or something like that... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The problem comes in when parents think their child &quot;needs&quot; a <br/>\nclassical education.

My question was geared toward how to <br/>\nhandle stuff that you may consider going against your values or <br/>\nideals within the context of unschooling. Joyce&#39;s post on Big Bird <br/>\nsimply triggered my question.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s really hard to know when to allow your kids to not do <br/>\nsomething that you think they need.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a homeopthic point of view, I&#39;m facing that now.  My son (5 <br/>\nyears old) has been going to a homeopath for awhile and was cured of <br/>\nfood allergies.  But he still has this thing where he hates to leave <br/>\nthe house, and he&#39;s being treated for that.  So he hates to leave the <br/>\nhouse, is mad because he&#39;s there, and refuses to take a remedy that <br/>\nwill make it easier for him to leave his house.  Would you hold him <br/>\ndown and force him to take it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child had a serious cavity and didn&#39;t want to go get it <br/>\nfilled, do you make him?  How many parents would really be at peace <br/>\nwith watching their child&#39;s teeth fall out if that&#39;s what the parents <br/>\nchoose?  Yet there are some adults who choose to not treat cavities <br/>\nand not go to the dentist.  When do we let go? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if his appendix burst and he refused to go to the hospital for <br/>\nan operation?  Do you let him stay home and die?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point I think all parents would step in and say, &quot;I am going <br/>\nto take care of your needs whether you like it or not&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem comes in when parents think their child &quot;needs&quot; a <br/>\nclassical education.  Or they &quot;need&quot; socialization.
