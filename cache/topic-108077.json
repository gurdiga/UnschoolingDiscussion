I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t explain the point of the<br/>\nbook right. The book &quot;Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling<br/>\nOurselves&quot; does not justify pressing lessons on kids. The whole book<br/>\nis about just the opposite. It shows how disastrous it is to press<br/>\nlessons on kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, and the writer of the book would agree, more than twice IS<br/>\njust too much. If she could go back in time and take back whatever<br/>\nefforts she ever made to foist schoolish lessons on her kids, I&#39;m sure<br/>\nshe would. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the stories she tells are her true stories. She was an elementary<br/>\nschool teacher who was thoroughly brainwashed, and it took years for<br/>\nher to become unschooled (hence the title).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one particularly sad story about how her son&#39;s enthusiasm for<br/>\na particular thing was quashed by her schoolteacherish attempts to<br/>\n&quot;help&quot; him &quot;do it right.&quot; She didn&#39;t even do or say much, but even<br/>\nwhat seemed like a little bit had a big effect. Reading about the<br/>\nprocess of his passion dying was just excruciating. He never became<br/>\ninterested in that area again -- maybe he never will -- maybe her<br/>\nwell-meaning blunder changed his whole life. Her chagrin over it is<br/>\ndeep and real. I found the whole episode appalling, instructive, and a<br/>\ndramatic illustration of the awesome negative potential of the<br/>\nschoolish approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf reading this book, or a similar one, can short-circuit an<br/>\neducation-oriented person&#39;s impulse to pull out the workbooks now and<br/>\nthen (whenever they lose faith in their child, in other words), then I<br/>\nthink it is an ideal recommendation. That is the effect it has had for<br/>\nme. It shows how damaging the schoolish lessons can be, and the<br/>\nimportance and validity of getting out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nVesna<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/7/05 1:35:48 PM, duonexus@t... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-She shares how nervewracking, but ultimately rewarding, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was every time she and her husband would TRULY let go and TRULY let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the children learn at their own paces.=<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s much better for the parents and the kids and the family and every <br/>\n&gt; relationship dyad if they truly let go once and don&#39;t go back.  <br/>\n&quot;Every time...&quot; <br/>\n&gt; sounds like it was more than twice.

She shares the story of how she and her<br/>\nhusband worked through their fears about letting go of workbooks and<br/>\ncurriculums and learned to trust and respect their children&#39;s natural<br/>\nintelligence, curiousity, and developing selves. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe shares how events unfolded when she would try to clamp down and<br/>\nbring in some formal educational experiences -- genrally these would<br/>\nbring on strain to her relationships with her children and dampen<br/>\ntheir enthusiasm about whatever the topic was. She shares<br/>\ninspirational stories about their adventures in self-directed<br/>\nlearning. She shares how nervewracking, but ultimately rewarding, it<br/>\nwas every time she and her husband would TRULY let go and TRULY let<br/>\nthe children learn at their own paces.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, her son didn&#39;t learn the math that is considered<br/>\nnecessary until he was fifteen or so. Then he picked up some<br/>\nworkbooks, sat himself down, and went through the entire 12-year<br/>\ncurriculum in three months. Because he decided it was time for him to<br/>\nlearn, and he had some reasons to be able to pass certain tests. By<br/>\nthe time this came about, his mind was so sharp that it was all a very<br/>\nsmooth process. (So what would have been gained by him being tortured<br/>\nwith that stuff for 12 solid years, instead of just waiting for his<br/>\npersonal right time?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also illustrates how VERY different children can be, and the<br/>\nimportance of trusting their rightness. For instance, although the son<br/>\n (older) learned to read of his own accord at 4, the daughter learned<br/>\nat 8. This was a nervewracking time for McKee, but she managed to<br/>\nrestrain herself from interfering, and when eventually the daughter<br/>\nlearned, it happened very quickly, and because the daughter wanted to<br/>\ndo it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth kids went on to be high achievers in college.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book, I think, addresses the fears you discuss in your post. The<br/>\nwriter shared all of them and lived to tell the tale! BTW, this is the<br/>\nbook that got me hooked on Holt and unschooling.

And it is all mostly a big huge waste of time<br/>\nbecause the kids are learning that WRITING IS HARD and MISERABLE and<br/>\nnobody in their right mind would do it unless it was forced on them.<br/>\nTHAT is the big lesson learned and, as Frank Smith says, when<br/>\nsomething is really learned, it is very very difficult to ever<br/>\nunlearn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron left school at 12. He swore to me he would never read or write <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first year, he spent a lot of time on the computer IMing mostly. (I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t remind him that *was* writing and reading! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe avoided both as best he could. And did a pretty good job of that as <br/>\nI remember! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started reading a bit these last couple of years---mostly books on <br/>\ndead rock & rollers! &lt;g&gt; He has a HUGE book on Phish, and we&#39;ve bought <br/>\nhim numerous books on Jimi Hendrix, The Dead, The Beatles, The Stones, <br/>\nCream, etc. He&#39;s devoured them all. He gets magazines on drumming <br/>\n(Relix & Modern Drummer)----cover to cover! He took _Wherever You Go, <br/>\nThere You Are_ with him to read on the plane.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years, writing seemed to be limited to thank you notes and <br/>\noccasional journaling, which he NEVER thought he&#39;d enjoy!. He bought a <br/>\nnew journal for his trip to Scotland this week. And he and his <br/>\ngirlfriend share a journal and write back and forth to each other in <br/>\nit. I don&#39;t know how many journals he&#39;s gone through lately! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe just got back from Not Back to School Camp in West Virginia. He&#39;s <br/>\ntotally devoted to writing letters to his new friends---long, <br/>\nart-filled letters with deep thoughts and life questions. It&#39;s so neat <br/>\nto see him into letter writing! He eagerly awaits the postman (and is <br/>\ndisappointed when there&#39;s nothing for him!) and spend hours writing <br/>\nletters and doing little bits of art in the margins and on the <br/>\nenvelopes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool damaged him---but not beyond repair! He HAS unlearned it. But I <br/>\nbelieve that is only because I (and his dad and he!) so totally <br/>\nunderstand how unschooling ----and LEARNING!---works. And we trust that <br/>\nhe&#39;ll learn everything he needs to know when he&#39;s ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] I need some help.....(sorry it&#39;s long)","postDate":"1125766593","msgId":108091,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQzMUVBNkQ5LUQwMEQtNDhEQS05RUE2LUYyNzYzNUFDRTMyQ0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTAzMTIxMTUxLkVVRU0xMjE2NS5tdGExMC5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAU3VnYXI+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTAzMTIxMTUxLkVVRU0xMjE2NS5tdGExMC5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAU3VnYXI+"},"prevInTopic":108086,"nextInTopic":108092,"prevInTime":108090,"nextInTime":108092,"topicId":108077,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Do homeschool groups in your area get<br/>\ntogether and organize trips to zoos, theaters, tours of places, museums,<br/>\netc?  My children still play a lot (now almost 9 and 10.5) but it has always<br/>\nbeen the case that as they were exposed to something (ballet comes to mind<br/>\nright now) that they incorporated whatever it was into their play.  After<br/>\ngoing to the Nutcracker each year, they would play ballet for weeks.

I always helped my kids write to their pen pals<br/>\nby suggesting other things they could add to the letter about themselves or<br/>\ntheir interests and other questions they could ask.  Sometimes they&#39;d take<br/>\nmy suggestions and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t.

Is it so he can use it in<br/>\nreal life?  It sounds like he can already do this when he needs to.

I have always played them WITH<br/>\nmy kids, not just suggested to them that they go off and play them.  There<br/>\nis lots of math (more like real life math) involved in games.  Lots of<br/>\ncritical thinking. They&#39;ve always been able to play games geared toward<br/>\nolder kids because I was there to help them.   I love the games by Thinkfun<br/>\nlike Rush Hour Traffic Jam.  You play them alone and they are logic games.<br/>\nThey are fun and encourage critical thinking.

Or do<br/>\nyou do nothing and hope that eventually the kids will come around and want<br/>\nto learn something?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to look at our life, you might consider it &quot;doing nothing&quot; since<br/>\nI don&#39;t do anything that looks schoolish or like &quot;encouraging learning&quot;. It<br/>\nis basically completely unnecessary and possibly counter-productive.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn needs absolutely zero encouragement to pursue her interests. She needs<br/>\nno encouragement to learn about any number of fun and/or useful - to her -<br/>\ntopics. She needs no encouragement to practice skills like drawing, making<br/>\nletters, hand stands or climbing the monkey bars, activities that are<br/>\nimportant to her. She is an absolute whirlwind of energy except when she is<br/>\na quiet deep thinking ponderer. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I *do* is drive her places, arrange play dates and outings, read to her<br/>\nwhenever she wants, buy toys and art supplies, set her up on the computer<br/>\nwhen she wants to play, set her up to make potions or help her do baking,<br/>\nset up her dvd&#39;s or record tv shows, find answers to her questions on line<br/>\nif I don&#39;t know the information, help her when she is emotionally<br/>\noverwhelmed, act as an intermediary with her friends if she asks me for<br/>\nassistance, and play various kinds of fantasy and practical games when<br/>\ninvited.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of &quot;encouraging learning&quot; can be problematic. I sense that this<br/>\nis an occasion when the type of learning that you would wish to encourage<br/>\nmight be rather schoolish, in that it would resemble the separate subjects<br/>\nand competence levels that you would expect to see in whatever grade your<br/>\nchildren would be placed by age. It is easy to see &quot;reading&quot; or &quot;writing<br/>\nletters&quot; as worthy of encouragement. Unfortunately this mind set all too<br/>\neasily slides into considering other less obviously &quot;educational&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;vocational&quot; interests as less worthy of encouragement and possibly even<br/>\nthat they should be dis-couraged.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Jayn needs encouragement to go out to a planned event when home is<br/>\nso inviting, but that doesn&#39;t sound like the type of thing you mean. It is<br/>\nquite impossible to stop children from learning, however we can<br/>\ninadvertently make what they are learning ideas like &quot;Mom thinks I&#39;m dumb&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;Mom doesn&#39;t like what I am into so I have to keep it secret&quot; or &quot;Mom<br/>\nloves me more when I do school for her&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would encourage you to practice more acceptance of where they are at and<br/>\nwhat they enjoy doing instead of worrying about what they are not doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For example, he will write &quot;hi how are you<br/>\ndoing?  I have a lizard and a snake.  I am sending you a pokemon card.<br/>\nBye.&quot;  And that is the extent of his letter.  I don&#39;t want to critisize his<br/>\nefforts, but I certainly don&#39;t want him to write letters to someone that<br/>\nmake no sense.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I certainly agree that this letter is the soul of brevity, which<br/>\nsometimes can in itself signal that it was an assigned task rather than a<br/>\nspontaneous desire to communicate something. However to say that it makes no<br/>\nsense is inaccurate. It makes a lot of sense to me, and I am not even the<br/>\nrecipient. He politely opens with a inquiry, gives some info that is a<br/>\npossible conversation opener for the reply, and includes a gift. I think it<br/>\nis a rather nice letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetter writing is an art that I never mastered. It is astonishing how much<br/>\nmore I prefer e-mail. In the past I was phone caller, rather than a letter<br/>\nwriter. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I think the real reason that I never wrote many letters, and<br/>\ncertainly never really got beyond &quot;How are you I am well&quot;, was because I was<br/>\nwriting &quot;obligation&quot; letters to my grandparents and later mother. I had no<br/>\nreal desire to communicate anything to them - certainly not to share my<br/>\ndreams or hopes or wishes or private notions or even the events in my life.<br/>\nI was convinced they would find my life neither interesting nor amusing, and<br/>\nwould probably use my tales as opportunities to critique me and my choices.<br/>\nCertainly as a youngster I was infected with that &quot;keep my life secret from<br/>\nuntrustworthy adults&quot; paradigm.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I believe I have something to say that some people might want to<br/>\nhear, in a network with common interests, I am pretty much unstoppable. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you&#39;ve<br/>\nstarted.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving out the joke part and just in passing, this is another concept that<br/>\nis rather an anathema to Unschooling with joy. I believe that one of the<br/>\nfacets of inner peace is to feel free to quit any project that ceases to<br/>\nfill my needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
