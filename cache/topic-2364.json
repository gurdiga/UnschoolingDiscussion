He is the one<br/>\nthat wants them complete the year of guitar, regardless of interest or<br/>\nability.  I am the one that will let them drop activities as their interest<br/>\nand ability dictates unless it is a team sort of thing.  If you have other<br/>\nmembers of a team or organization counting on you, then you must finish out<br/>\nthe season or production.
