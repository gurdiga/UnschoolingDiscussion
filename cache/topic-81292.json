I&#39;m new to this list, though know some of you in &quot;real life&quot;<br/>\nand recognize a lot of names from other lists I&#39;m on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Alyce, I have 3 kids - 2 of &quot;school&quot; age, and one who&#39;s older<br/>\nand trying to find her way/direction in life at the present...<br/>\nTechnically I&#39;d say she&#39;s being unschooled as well, though the law at<br/>\nthis point doesn&#39;t require she be &quot;schooled&quot; at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK...now...<br/>\nI was avoiding the whole beliefs thread because trying to discuss that<br/>\nsort of ultimately abstract &quot;thing&quot; is hard using words... And in the<br/>\nend gives me a big fat headache.  BUT I got drawn into to it even<br/>\nscrolling past at a relatively high rate of speed... I was compelled to<br/>\nadd &quot;Illusions, the Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah&quot; by Richard Bach<br/>\nis probably my all time favorite book.  I&#39;ve owned several copies... I<br/>\nkeep lending them out and they never come back to me.  :)  The first<br/>\ncopy I gave away about 20 years ago to a man (boy then - we were<br/>\nteenagers) I ended up marrying 2 years ago this Halloween.  I find that<br/>\ninteresting and it only just occurred to me in this writing.  Anyway...<br/>\nThat&#39;s neither here nor there as I&#39;m sure nobody wants to hear the<br/>\nmeandering tale of the last 20 years of my life.  Finally, Holly, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have said it better myself and I&#39;d be loathe to try.  That&#39;s<br/>\nit!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Alyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81210,"nextTopicId":81273}}
