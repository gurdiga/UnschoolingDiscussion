It was<br/>\na great place to live! Families were very close, little tv watching<br/>\n(that 5-hour time difference really ruins prime time television<br/>\nviewing!), and lots of social/neighborly functions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe always enjoyed the PhilAm Society functions, hosted by the Filipino<br/>\ncommunity. Great food (remember lumpia?), and we learned so many neat<br/>\nthings about their culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and husband remember salmon fishing in the stream near Finger<br/>\nBay. The salmon were so thick the water was black. My son&#39;s first<br/>\n&quot;catch&quot; was actually a salmon which had jumped out of the stream,<br/>\nlanding on his foot! We&#39;ll never let him live THAT fish story down! He<br/>\nalso remembers as a little boy being afraid of the swooping eagles when<br/>\nhe went fishing with his dad. Remember the numerous bald eagle<br/>\npopulation? My son used to call immature eagles, &quot;minature&quot; eagles,<br/>\nconfusing his words! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe saw some great sites while living there. Otters, Emperor Geese, sea<br/>\nlions, halibut the size of small automobiles! Once, a couple of Beluga<br/>\nwhales beached themselves over at Kuluk Bay. We saw puffins and<br/>\nptarmigan and caribou. When dining at a Denali Park restaurant on an<br/>\noff-island trip, we ate booburgers, not hamburgers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids fondly remember having to wear earplugs while flying on C-130&#39;s<br/>\nor C-147&#39;s, and the flight crew allowing them in the cockpit to view the<br/>\ngreat expanse of blue sky out those cabin windows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess our most exciting memory of Adak was the 7.7 earthquake we<br/>\nexperienced about five weeks after we moved there! My husband happened<br/>\nto be in Anchorage then doing some Army Reserve stuff. He was in the<br/>\npost exchange when they announced over the loudspeaker that Adak had<br/>\njust experienced the quake. Talk about frantic! The telephone lines were<br/>\ndown for some time and he as really worried. Everything was ok, though;<br/>\njust slight damage to some dishes and such. Everyone &quot;evactuated&quot; to<br/>\nBering Hill and waited for the tsunami which never arrived! It was scary<br/>\nat the time, though, I must admit. T-shirts were printed up afterwards<br/>\nboasting, &quot;I survived a 7.7!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that always left me humbled was the beautiful, tiny, delicate<br/>\nviolets, anenomes, and other wildflowers which would shoot up out of<br/>\nthat nasty old tundra every spring. It seemed impossible to me that<br/>\nsomething so delicate could blanket what had only weeks earlier been<br/>\nfrozen over with snow and ice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was lucky enough once to fly out to Attu on a trip to Anchorage;<br/>\nusually, the planes would only go as far west as Shemya to pick up<br/>\npassengers, and then head to Anchorage. To this day, I love to remind my<br/>\nhusband that I&#39;VE been to Attu, and he hasn&#39;t! Once in a blue moon,<br/>\n&quot;Attu&quot; will be a Jeopardy! answer, and I always have to say something<br/>\nlike, &quot;Do you remember that...oh, I&#39;m sorry Jimmy, you&#39;ve never been<br/>\nthere.&quot; LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made some great friends while living there (we were civilians), some<br/>\nof whom we still keep in touch.
