Its been a fascinating conversation with lots of leads in lots of areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned a lot, and found some areas where, for whatever reason,  I wasn&#39;t clear on what unschooling was.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you also for your support while I figured out what to do about the &quot;school&quot; / &quot;unschool&quot; issue as it applies to math  right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel much better now letting go of it all.  Since I am a product of public school I&#39;m sure there are lots of things that will come up with regard to old ways of thinking.  I&#39;m guessing its a never ending process.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I feel as though I&#39;m spending a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to make myself clear.  And it seems that my questions make others feel the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if that is overextending the purpose of this particular list, but it appears that it might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to give it a rest now, and go think about other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58287,"nextTopicId":58229}}
