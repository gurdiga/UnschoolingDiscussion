The Scope and Sequence is a list of &quot;Typical Course <br/>\nStudy&quot; broken down by grade level and subject.  There are different <br/>\nplace to obtain this however, they are pretty much all the same.  I <br/>\nthink the best place to get it is:<br/>\n<br/>\n    www.worldbook.com/ptrc/hyml/curr1.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep in mind that this list is a &quot;Typical Course Study&quot; that <br/>\nthe ps system thinks should be taught.  This is where I ran into <br/>\ntroubles.  It is however a good place to get started.  If your child <br/>\nis a hands on learner like mine you may find it difficult to follow <br/>\nthis exactly.  I have found that asking questions from people who <br/>\nhave been doing this for a long time is the best.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck in your adventure.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8568,"nextTopicId":8565}}
