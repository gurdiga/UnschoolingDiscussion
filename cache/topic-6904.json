I am the unschooling mother of two in Portland Oregon. I love the <br/>\nunschooling life and write about it extensively on my home page and in my new <br/>\njob, the unschooling editor for Suite101. I am also a freelance writer and <br/>\nown way to many pets:)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, history is one of the easiest things of all to learn, we use books, <br/>\nLike the Witch of Black Bird Pond, to get a feel for the time period. We also <br/>\nuse movies and further investigate whatever piques our interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to getting to know you all and learning from this list:)<br/>\nTeri<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nTeri Brown<br/>\nSuite101 Unschooling Editor <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/unschooling\">http://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/unschooling</a><br/>\nAssistant Editor For Voices, <br/>\nThe Journal of the National Home Education Network www.nhen.org<br/>\nColumnist For The Link: A Homeschooling Newspaper<br/>\nHomeschooling - Christian Unschooling - Natural learning<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/\">http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/</a><br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6895,"nextTopicId":6910}}
