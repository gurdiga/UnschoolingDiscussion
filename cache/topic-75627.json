I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t begin to tell you the difference I felt when I stopped<br/>\n&gt; eating soy products, just within 2-3 days.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What infuriates her - and rightfully so - is that she<br/>\n&gt; consumed soy products for 10 years, &quot;thinking I was eating<br/>\n&gt; healthy and being told that was the case.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In particular, I was concerned with one detail in Chefgirl&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; posting: her comment that the isoflavones in soy are<br/>\n&gt; responsible for thyroid dysfunction. If soy isoflavones cause<br/>\n&gt; thyroid problems, wouldn&#39;t that also be true of other<br/>\n&gt; sources, such as red clover (which we&#39;ve recommended as an<br/>\n&gt; alternative to soy)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A little legwork with our research sources soon turned up a<br/>\n&gt; comment on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center web<br/>\n&gt; site, warning that due to the estrogenic activity of red<br/>\n&gt; clover, it should be used with caution by patients with<br/>\n&gt; hormone-sensitive diseases. And that would include thyroid<br/>\n&gt; conditions, of course.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you consume a high quantity of soy foods, or if you use<br/>\n&gt; red clover, here are some of the symptoms of hypothyroid<br/>\n&gt; disease that you should be aware of: low energy, slowing of<br/>\n&gt; the healing process, edema (swelling, usually in the feet or<br/>\n&gt; legs), and unusual changes in skin, nails or hair.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This serves as a perfect reminder that herbal supplements are<br/>\n&gt; natural medicines that can have powerful effects and should<br/>\n&gt; be used with care. So if you&#39;ve been diagnosed with thyroid<br/>\n&gt; problems, you should probably avoid soy, red clover, and<br/>\n&gt; other foods or botanicals touted as high in isoflavones. And<br/>\n&gt; as always, consult your doctor whenever you use any<br/>\n&gt; nutritional or herbal remedy to address a medical condition.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Other topics being discussed on the HSI Forum this week<br/>\n&gt; include:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * If you have any doubt that genetic modification of crops is<br/>\n&gt;   a hot button issue, just visit the thread &quot;GM Foods,&quot; which<br/>\n&gt;   has more than 80 postings in a very lively debate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * A thread titled &quot;McDonald&#39;s to Eliminate Using Beef...&quot; is<br/>\n&gt;   a reaction to Wednesday&#39;s e-Alert, &quot;McMedicine&quot; (see<br/>\n&gt;   below), but Big Macs may not be as antibiotic-free as we<br/>\n&gt;   are supposed to believe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * An HSI member named Lee offers a warning in &quot;Forteo, Unsafe<br/>\n&gt;   Drug for Osteoporosis.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you have questions or comments you&#39;d like to add to these<br/>\n&gt; or any of the dozens of other threads on the Forum, just log<br/>\n&gt; on to our web site at www.hsibaltimore.com and join in with<br/>\n&gt; the conversations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;     Underground Cures Your Doctor Doesn&#39;t Even Know About!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Starting today, YOU can decide how healthy you want to be.

And<br/>\n&gt; while that may sound promising, you can be certain that there<br/>\n&gt; are gremlins in the details. This e-Alert looks at the<br/>\n&gt; misguided logic of trading a lower risk of one problem, for<br/>\n&gt; the side effects that come with a lifetime supply of multiple<br/>\n&gt; prescription drugs.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hsibaltimore.com/ea2003/ea_030623.shtml\">http://www.hsibaltimore.com/ea2003/ea_030623.shtml</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tuesday, June 24, 2003<br/>\n&gt; Soy-onara<br/>\n&gt; Does soy intake help prevent breast cancer? In spite of what<br/>\n&gt; you may have heard, there&#39;s no easy answer to that question,<br/>\n&gt; which is at the heart of a long, ongoing debate. But a<br/>\n&gt; recently completed 10-year study from Japan reveals some<br/>\n&gt; promising new clues that could eventually lead to useful<br/>\n&gt; answers. We&#39;ll tell you about the best source for the<br/>\n&gt; compound that is believed to be the active component in<br/>\n&gt; preventing breast cancer.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hsibaltimore.com/ea2003/ea_030624.shtml\">http://www.hsibaltimore.com/ea2003/ea_030624.shtml</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wednesday, June 25, 2003<br/>\n&gt; McMedicine<br/>\n&gt; Last week McDonald&#39;s Corporation told its meat suppliers to<br/>\n&gt; discontinue the use of antibiotics in animals.
