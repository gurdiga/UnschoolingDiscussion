Play therapy?  (Are there serious home problems?  I doubt it--you<br/>\nsaid<br/>\nthis was from birth, and play therapy isn&#39;t going to get to a genetic<br/>\nlevel--they&#39;re looking for trauma or odd relationships or behaviors on<br/>\nthe part of<br/>\nother family members in her life which she would act out with dolls or<br/>\npuppets.)****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo serious home problems,  just the usual sort.  No abuse of any kind.<br/>\nShe&#39;s been like she is all her life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****I&#39;d mention it.****<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m think I&#39;m going to.  We&#39;re going tomorrow night, I&#39;ll bring it up<br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****Two friends of mine are in counselling and the counsellor has a<br/>\nGREAT plan.<br/>\nOne of their major problems is the relationship between the dad and the<br/>\nmiddle<br/>\nchild, older of two boys.    That child is most like the mom (hmmmm) and<br/>\nthe<br/>\ndad is MEAN to him.<br/>\nSandra****<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff isn&#39;t mean to Storey, but she is most like him.  Intense, hard to<br/>\nget their attention when they are concentrating on something, do not<br/>\nlike to be told what to do or say.  Maybe that&#39;s why he finds her so<br/>\ndifficult and maybe that&#39;s why mil has such a hard time with her.  Jeff<br/>\nis her baby, the last of 7, and was not a planned child.  His parents<br/>\ndivorced when he was about 3 and she never really had much time for him<br/>\n(he is also the only one of the 7 who was never breast fed, she says she<br/>\nwas burned out).  Maybe Storey brings up too much stuff for her to<br/>\nhandle or even recognize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****there are great outcomes when you are blessed with such a child! -<br/>\nbut this is NOT an &quot;easy&quot; child****<br/>\n<br/>\nYou got that right.  And the older she gets the more I see how<br/>\nincredible she is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****Maybe try the &quot;Highly Sensitive Child&quot; book so often recommended<br/>\nhere!  Might helps you and maybe your<br/>\nhusband undestand her.****<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;ll look into that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****Maybe take a look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bullyonline.org\">http://www.bullyonline.org</a> generally and maybe<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bullyonline.org/familybully/index.htm\">http://www.bullyonline.org/familybully/index.htm</a> for help with mil.<br/>\nGreat site!  Helped me see where the<br/>\nlines of help/hurt are a lot more clearly.<br/>\nTim T****<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this, I&#39;ll check this out too and share it with Jeff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****My mother in law is difficult.  Not as bad as yours sounds, but not<br/>\ntoo fun<br/>\nfor too long.<br/>\nSandra****<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I didn&#39;t realize how difficult.  When Robin was born, he was so<br/>\neasy and she praised me for being such a good mom.  Funny, now I&#39;m a bad<br/>\nmom with one good kid and one bad kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****If anyone needs professional help to learn how to &#39;behave properly&#39;,<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\nyour mother in law.  Have you tried telling her privately that she needs<br/>\nto<br/>\nstop interfering in your mothering?<br/>\n~Rue****<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m actually a little afraid of her!  She&#39;s very good at manipulating<br/>\npeople&#39;s words into something other than they said.  And I&#39;m not<br/>\nexperienced with that.  Jeff has stood up to her, but he knows how she<br/>\noperates.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks much for the help and advice everyone.  Jeff and I will talk<br/>\nabout this in counseling and alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nWho&#39;s feeling less alone on this issue now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75974,"nextTopicId":75977}}
