That was <br/>\nmy last dealing with the state. I now belong to West River Academy. Peggy <br/>\nstarted it for unschoolers. Once a year I send her a list of what we do. I usually <br/>\njust take it off of the calendar: classes, field trips, appts., etc. She then <br/>\nwould use those to make a transcript, if I ever needed one. She also provides <br/>\nHS diplomas if your kids are interested in them. You also don&#39;t have to test <br/>\nor evaluate, unless you choose.
