I will be reviewing our finances/income/expenses over<br/>\nthe next few days or so and try to work on the spreadsheets they discuss. That<br/>\nway I should at least really understand what kind of $ I will be losing or who<br/>\nknows, winning. I appreciate all of the business advise. I think most of those<br/>\n&quot;niche&quot; businesses around here end up going to unions. I have in the past,<br/>\nworked a little side line business of my own that was actually being a rep for<br/>\nTattoo-A-Pet. It was mainly because I had a strong need to have my dogs tattooed<br/>\nand there was no one around to do so except the vets and then they did not<br/>\nregister them. It brought in a little bit of extra cash, but I was not doing it<br/>\nthen for the money at all. Now I will probably look into either the micro chip<br/>\nor get into a business where I help out the seniors in my area (again, I think<br/>\nour town offers a lot of this though for free). Getting health care is a<br/>\ndifferent story. Going to a service such as Blue Cross/Shield will cost my<br/>\nfamily a ton, especially if I wanted to get prenatal care if we decide to add<br/>\nmore to our family (which we do want to). I will not go with HMO&#39;s. I am<br/>\nstrongly against them (that is a totally different conversation). We have<br/>\nalready discussed moving, but our house is very small and moving into a<br/>\n&quot;cheaper&quot; area will really just mean moving into a more dangerous area.<br/>\nUnschooling my girls has been the only thing on my mind lately so I am really<br/>\ndoing research.
