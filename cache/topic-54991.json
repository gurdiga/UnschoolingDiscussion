I&#39;ve been waiting<br/>\nfor it to go on sale, and figured we would put it up in the spring. It<br/>\nhasn&#39;t gone above 20 degrees here for over a week, so I can&#39;t see them<br/>\nusing it now anyway. People down the road have one w/ a net, and the<br/>\ngirls have a ball on it. I hear that even with the net, there are a lot<br/>\nof reported injuries on them, and my neighbors<br/>\nhome owners insurance went up when the agent did a drive-by and saw the<br/>\ntrampoline. I think the problems would come in if the children are just<br/>\nleft to their own on it. They can get pretty wild. Oh well, if it becomes<br/>\na problem, it comes down just as quick as it goes up.<br/>\nThanks for the tip.<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] trampoline","postDate":"1042587721","msgId":54991,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNEE1RTYyLjFCNUQlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDI1ODEyNTcuMTQ0Mi40NTY5Lm04QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55004,"prevInTime":54990,"nextInTime":54992,"topicId":54991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
