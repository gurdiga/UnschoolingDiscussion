I was diagnosed with Diabetes when I was<br/>\n3 years old.  My Grandmother told me as a child that<br/>\nI could not have children.  For 12 years I heard this<br/>\non a daily basis.  At the tender age of 16,  I became<br/>\npregnant with my first child.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe never meant any harm to me.  But after hearing <br/>\nthose words over and over again I believed them on<br/>\na subconscience level.  So when I had sex at 15 I did<br/>\nnot use any protection because I thought that &quot;I could<br/>\nnot have children&quot; because I was told so.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow at the age of 33 I think it is kind of funny.<br/>\nBut so terribly sad.  I love both of my children<br/>\nvery much but I was to young at 16 to understand<br/>\nhow much responsibility comes with a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri P.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________<br/>\nWatch a championship game with Elway or McGwire.<br/>\nEnter Now at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://champions.lycos.com\">http://champions.lycos.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45898,"nextTopicId":46000}}
