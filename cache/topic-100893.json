I had asked there if <br/>\npeople knew where I might find orange knee socks.  There were a few leads, Holly <br/>\nand I spent some time at Coronado Mall, and I reported back to the list.  <br/>\nThought I&#39;d share it here too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I might be too late, but I would try the soccer stores.  I seem to remember <br/>\nbeing on a team as a child that required orange socks. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had orange and white, I learned by phone, but not solid orange.<br/>\n<br/>\nMacy&#39;s had some nice long white cotton socks, and we got two pairs and some <br/>\ndye from Langell&#39;s (Rit didn&#39;t have orange or I probably would&#39;ve have used the <br/>\ncheap grocery store dye).  Then we had to buy soda ash to follow the <br/>\ninstructions.  Then I realized the instructions are overkill, to make the dye bright <br/>\nand life-long-lasting, and we only needed them for Halloween. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the same time we got a pair for Holly&#39;s fairy costume and dyed them <br/>\nopposite stripes (small purple and large pink stripes on one, and the other way <br/>\non the other). <br/>\n<br/>\nExpensive project, for two pairs of socks, and my fingers are still purplish, <br/>\nbut while I did that Holly carved a couple of jack-o-lanterns from pumpkins <br/>\nwe grew, and we listened to Fred Astaire (one of Holly&#39;s favorites and <br/>\ninterests, and fairly foreign to me because I generally avoided that kind of music <br/>\nmost of my life).   I really like it when one of my kids knows more about <br/>\nsomething and shares that interest with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if we&#39;d found orange socks it would&#39;ve been easier, but I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nbeen in the kitchen for an hour and fifteen minutes discussing small jazz band <br/>\nvs. &quot;big band&quot; music, and Irving Berlin, and black and white movies vs. color <br/>\nmovies.  Holly knows Madelyn Kahn from both Paper Moon and Young Frankenstein, <br/>\nboth of which are in black and white although they were filmed in the 1970&#39;s.  <br/>\nEach of those movies has an Irving Berlin song, and both those songs were on <br/>\nthe Fred Astaire CD we were listening to.  But Fred Astaire doesn&#39;t sing them <br/>\nin the movies.  One is done by Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle as Frankenstein and <br/>\nthe monster (&quot;Puttin&#39; on the Ritz&quot;) and the other done by Tatum O&#39;Neal as <br/>\nAddie (&quot;Let&#39;s Have Another Cup of Coffee,&quot; which she sings parts of to herself <br/>\nwhile putting on her new hat and looking forward to getting a piano, I think it <br/>\nis, and after hearing that part Holly wanted to learn the whole song which led <br/>\nme to buying the same CD).<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything&#39;s connected!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n------------<br/>\nAnother thing from that conversation was Holly asking me &quot;Was Fred Astaire an <br/>\nactor?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood question.  She meant what was he primarily considered.  I said, since we <br/>\nwere listening to a CD of music, he was &quot;a crooner,&quot; the word for singers of <br/>\nthat style.  But that above singing and acting, he was considered &quot;a hoofer,&quot; <br/>\na stage dancer.  He was an actor too, but he sure wasn&#39;t acting like he was <br/>\nsinging or dancing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays sometimes that&#39;s faked, but in the 1930&#39;s there was no way and no <br/>\nreason, really.   Fred Astaire wasn&#39;t really &quot;good looking&quot; by modern standards <br/>\n(or even by the standards of his day), but he was so talented and charismatic <br/>\nthat the idea of a funny-looking guy who could fit in any company and be <br/>\ngentlemanly was a big, attractive deal to men and women both.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100906,"nextTopicId":100908}}
