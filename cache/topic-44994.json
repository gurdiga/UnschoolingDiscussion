Except for the extra library book - DH has a limit of 20 books a week for him, so it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a big difference between 20 and 21 books. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not use the heart system when we&#39;re not at home, so he has plenty of chances to act right without the &quot;reward&quot; of getting hearts. However, he does not do so unless we are somewhere that keeps him very busy and interested. If he goes to my parents house, for example, he ends up having to sit alone in a room or still on the couch because he just goes wild and will/can not calm down on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hearts give him a tangible reminder of loving, soft feelings plus are a reminder that nice, sweet behavior is better than hurtful behavior.  They have made such a huge difference here, he is so much happier and his little brother is not constantly crying from being hurt. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  Okay I&#39;m just talking out loud here. It seems that so far, the things you <br/>\n  are giving you son with the heart is something big and worth something to <br/>\n  him. He obviously enjoys what these things are or what he gets to do. So <br/>\n  maybe you see it as not worth much but he sees it differently. Wonder if he <br/>\n  wasn&#39;t harmful, then he couldn&#39;t get the chance to be &#39;good&#39; and have his <br/>\n  rewards. So to get the rewards, he has to show the other side too or else <br/>\n  the rewards would eventually stop. Have you tried to give him a color bath <br/>\n  when he wants and let him stay up late when he wants and check out an extra <br/>\n  book when he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally I can&#39;t imagine with holding those things from a child if thats <br/>\n  what they want. Big deal to a kid but not to a parent.

So you&#39;re paying him for <br/>\nthe convenience of not having to smell some stink. It&#39;s not a reward, it&#39;s <br/>\nsimply telling him that you are willing to pay for a convenience which is not <br/>\nabsolutely necessary.<br/>\nOn the other hand, hitting is harmful.<br/>\nIt&#39;s emotionally and physically damaging. There is a motivating factor behind <br/>\nthe hitting which indicates a lack of self control....normal for certain <br/>\nages, but not something you can let go.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about paying for a convenience....it&#39;s about safety, and nurture and <br/>\nbehavioral urges. It&#39;s about allowing abuse to take place. And a child must <br/>\nlearn self control at some point or else you have an abusive adult harming <br/>\nother humans.<br/>\nI believe self control grows on it&#39;s own to some degree. But in the mean time <br/>\nthere is a lot a parent can do to protect the weaker one and give the <br/>\nagressor more tools to use.<br/>\nIt is our job to help them get more tools.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t give them tools by controlling them.
