Didn&#39;t<br/>\nfind that the pop and salt worked well.  We had lots of fun with making<br/>\nsalt mountains and using vinegar and baking soda to make the volcanoes.<br/>\nFortunately I buy in bulk.  We made a whole scene on a large plastic<br/>\ntray with houses (from a game).  We also looked at volcano related words<br/>\nand looked up volcanoes in the encyclopedia.  Didn&#39;t have much luck with<br/>\nthe web sites. It was a fun morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15324,"nextTopicId":15328}}
