Tomorrow we&#39;re going to schlepp them off to the<br/>\nlake and see how far we can drift before we have to be rescued. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got a gash in my right hip (ok, butt cheek) and didn&#39;t know it was<br/>\nreally a gash until I was out of the water.<br/>\nThe eleven year old expert said it was probably from a sharp stick.  He<br/>\nwas poked once in the foot by a sharp stick and so now anything that<br/>\nstabs unsuspecting fun worshipers is probably a stick.   I told my family<br/>\nwhat it really was but they&#39;re having a hard time accepting the<br/>\npossibility of a great white shark in the waters of Montana. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week we found a small colony of Pelicans at east end of the Nevada<br/>\nCreek reservoir where Pelicans never stay for more than a brief stop<br/>\nover.  This group of fifty four has been there since the end of June,<br/>\nalong with a hundred or more Canadian geese and other assorted waterfowl.<br/>\n  Our last day there we counted six Great blue Herons.  Dylan practiced<br/>\nskipping stones.  We tried to catch crayfish without getting pinched.  We<br/>\nfound some nice rocks to add to the collection. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be thinking of you all tomorrow while I&#39;m floating at Georgetown<br/>\nlake, watching the sand pipers and getting sunburned here in balmy<br/>\nMontana where the temperature reached a nearly tropical one hundred and<br/>\none degrees on Saturday.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, loving summer.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78056,"nextTopicId":78063}}
