(snipped)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one said *I* wanted them (other than *my* dog which I&#39;ve had for 14yrs<br/>\nwhom *I* feed and water). That was the deal when we got them, &quot;They are not<br/>\nmine and I will not be responsible for them, are you SURE about this?&quot; &quot;Oh,<br/>\nyes!&quot;<br/>\n:-)  I understand you don&#39;t know the whole situation and are just going on<br/>\nassumptions. I don&#39;t feel picked on, you had a somewhat valid question. I<br/>\nam curious though why, if you were unsure, you didn&#39;t ask who&#39;s animals<br/>\nthey were instead of assuming they were mine - an animal lover who gladly<br/>\nlooks after her own pet?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This is another one that I wondered about.  I don&#39;t remember the original<br/>\n&gt; post, so I don&#39;t know whether you said you limited TV for your kids or<br/>\n&gt; not.  But if you do, then who is it that prefers other things to TV<br/>\n&gt; watching, you and dh or all of you?<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I&#39;ve said before - tv is not a big part of our lives so tv viewing is<br/>\nvery limited. We do have certain shows we like to watch but if there&#39;s<br/>\nsomething better to do, and there usually is, we miss them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI respond to a message on the list about parents who require things of<br/>\ntheir children are not real unschoolers and it turns into the great debate<br/>\nover tv. So why should our family be watching more tv, are you undercover<br/>\nnetwork executives trying to drum up viewers? LOL  Is business really that<br/>\nbad? (chuckle)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This TV thing keeps coming up, and I think it&#39;s important.  I&#39;ve always<br/>\n&gt; been a TV hater.  I&#39;d live really happily without it.  We didn&#39;t have<br/>\ncable<br/>\n&gt; for years, and dh and son went next door to the in-laws to watch.  I<br/>\n&gt; thought it was great not having to listen to it.  So I really understand<br/>\n&gt; where you&#39;re coming from if you don&#39;t like TV much.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because tv isn&#39;t high on our list of priorities doesn&#39;t mean we hate<br/>\ntv. If I hated it I wouldn&#39;t have it in my home. As for cable, the only<br/>\ntime I had it was for about 6 months when I had a roommate who ordered it.<br/>\nRecently we had DirecTV from Sept &#39;01 to Jan &#39;02 so DH could get NFL Sunday<br/>\nticket. Everyone said &quot;oh, wait til Jan you won&#39;t be able to get rid of<br/>\nit&quot;, were they ever wrong! LOL  Five channels are more than enough for us!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I had tried to limit TV for my son, but the availability of TV next door,<br/>\n&gt; with grandparents who weren&#39;t willing to enforce any rules about it, made<br/>\n&gt; that impossible.  (And dh wasn&#39;t any help.  He likes watching so much, he<br/>\n&gt; moved his office over there, so he could watch while he did his<br/>\n&gt; paperwork.)  I finally realized that not having to listen to the TV<br/>\nwasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; worth having no real family life, so we recently got a TV and cable.  All<br/>\n&gt; that just to say I&#39;m not a TV fan.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But discussions on this list got me thinking about the whole TV issue,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I had already come to the point where I felt that my son was obviously<br/>\n&gt; getting something from TV.  I even started to realize how much he learns<br/>\n&gt; from the TV, and he doesn&#39;t watch much stuff that&#39;s overtly<br/>\n&gt; educational.  He&#39;s not a book-learner and probably never will be.  The TV<br/>\n&gt; certainly isn&#39;t taking him away from books.  And it&#39;s not taking him away<br/>\n&gt; from physical activity.  He&#39;s always majored in P.E.  &lt;g&gt;  He uses the<br/>\n&gt; computer a lot, spends time with friends and family, builds things, works<br/>\n&gt; for his dad sometimes, and generally lives a pretty well-balanced life<br/>\n&gt; without the TV limits I would have liked to impose on him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also understand that there are some kids (I&#39;d guess very few) who<br/>\nreally<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t tear themselves away from the tube, no matter what.  (My<br/>\n&gt; granddaughter *might* even be one of them.  I&#39;m not yet convinced.)  I<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; agree that these kids probably need help with it.  But I hate to see that<br/>\n&gt; as the first suggestion people get when they are concerned about the TV<br/>\n&gt; issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s kind of like a new mother having breastfeeding problems and being<br/>\ntold<br/>\n&gt; first off that some women just aren&#39;t able to nurse their babies.  Now I<br/>\n&gt; know it happens, but it&#39;s very rare if women are given correct advice<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding.  I think it helps that new mother a lot more to help her<br/>\ngo<br/>\n&gt; through all the possibilities as to what&#39;s causing the problem before<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; putting the idea into her mind that she might not be successful.  The<br/>\nsame<br/>\n&gt; with the TV issue.  I&#39;d love to see the people who are concerned about<br/>\n&gt; their kids&#39; TV watching given all the kinds of suggestions I&#39;ve seen here<br/>\n&gt; from time to time for helping their kids stay balanced, before they get<br/>\n&gt; told that some kids just have to have it regulated.  Of course if the<br/>\n&gt; parent has already tried all those things, she might be really relieved<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; know that her kid might be one of those who requires help in limiting TV,<br/>\n&gt; but it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to start there.<br/>\n&gt; Tia<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough not very good netiquette I left the last four paragraphs intact.<br/>\nIs this directed at me? I&#39;m the only one you quoted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any suggestions for you, especially now that it is a habit. It<br/>\nhas never been a common thing for us so I&#39;m totally no help, we&#39;ve never<br/>\nbeen in the same boat. Maybe someone else here can help you if you&#39;d like<br/>\nsuggestions? I&#39;m not all that clear you&#39;re even asking for suggestions. You<br/>\nstart by sounding like you&#39;re defending (to whom I&#39;m not sure) your son&#39;s<br/>\ntv watching, then switch to chastising someone who has given advice that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work or you didn&#39;t like (unsure which), and then switch to wanting<br/>\nsuggestions. I&#39;m very sorry, try as I might I am unable to understand<br/>\nclearly what it is you want. Perhaps it&#39;s too early in the morning and I&#39;m<br/>\njust missing your point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your family/inlaw situation, I can&#39;t help with that either, I don&#39;t<br/>\nget in the middle of family differences. DH and I are very lucky, though it<br/>\nwas no accident, that we have basically the same views on parenting,<br/>\nchild-rearing, and home life. Life is much more calm in our household than<br/>\nsome we know. I wish everyone could have that.<br/>\nOne suggestion (not a mandate) for any future children you have: spend lots<br/>\nof time with them playing games, taking walks, reading together snuggled up<br/>\nand leave the tv off if you dislike it so much. If they never get used to<br/>\nit then it doesn&#39;t become a habit but rather another piece of furniture<br/>\nthat is used occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nFTR I have never said to anyone that children who watch tv need help with<br/>\ntearing themselves away from it or even that parents must regulate tv.<br/>\nI&#39;ve never told anyone what their family should or should not do regarding<br/>\ntv. I would never presume to tell anyone how to rear their children, and I<br/>\nwould expect the same respect back. I do like asking questions, I&#39;m<br/>\nnaturally curious, and I do like to help whenever I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said that tv viewing is not taking your son away from books but for us<br/>\nit would because we are all avid readers. This is just one difference<br/>\nbetween in our families goes to show that what works for one family doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork for another.<br/>\nGood luck on your unschooling quest!<br/>\n<br/>\nButtons<br/>\n<br/>\nPS<br/>\nDefending our choices as parents is not why I am on an &quot;unschooling&quot; list.<br/>\nI do enough of that with everyone else, an unschooling group should be for<br/>\nsupport and sharing ideas but that&#39;s JMHO. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling or not?","postDate":"1016003749","msgId":32339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxY2UwMWMxY2E2MiQ2YmNkMzFhMCRhMjVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAxNTcwMWMxYzlmMyRhODYwM2RjMCQzZTM4YWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":32334,"nextInTopic":32344,"prevInTime":32338,"nextInTime":32340,"topicId":32263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You talk in absolutes and then ask that folks not judge you.

But I do know that there is no clear cut definition that<br/>\n&gt; determines one to be an unschooler or not.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t agree with this statement. An original definition does not always<br/>\n&gt; apply as time goes on.

I believe<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; those examples are clear cut. I think it is possible to define it to an<br/>\n&gt; extent, and beyond that, debate is healthy and productive to learning.<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt;And if someone wants to hone a<br/>\n&gt; description based on their beleifs, they should coin a new term and stop<br/>\n&gt; picking on the ones that follow the loose description of the orignial<br/>\n&gt; work.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I should stop questioning? I should stop learning?<br/>\n&gt; I should stop stating my beliefs? I can&#39;t stop picking on others becasue I<br/>\n&gt; am not picking on them.<br/>\n&gt; A new term. Hmmm.There are many terms that are used for this.

In our family, I&#39;m the one who wanted the dog, so I&#39;m the one who <br/>\nlooks after him.  For several years, my son enjoyed entering chickens and <br/>\neggs in the Fall Fair, so he was (relatively) happy to look after <br/>\nthem.  When that interest grew old for him, I didn&#39;t mind taking over.  (We <br/>\nwould have had them anyway.)  I do ask him to do one small job every day, <br/>\nand I often ask him to help me out with other stuff.  Considering that he&#39;s <br/>\n14 &lt;g&gt; he&#39;s pretty good about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This quote was snipped a little short.<br/>\n&gt;In answer to your &quot;why?&quot; do we prefer all those things over tv watching,<br/>\n&gt;well I don&#39;t know, that is just our taste and lifestyle. Why do you have<br/>\n&gt;the preferences you have? (rhetorical question). We&#39;re just not big tv<br/>\n&gt;watchers so it was never used as a babysitter and it never became a habit<br/>\n&gt;to be broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is another one that I wondered about.  I don&#39;t remember the original <br/>\npost, so I don&#39;t know whether you said you limited TV for your kids or <br/>\nnot.  But if you do, then who is it that prefers other things to TV <br/>\nwatching, you and dh or all of you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis TV thing keeps coming up, and I think it&#39;s important.  I&#39;ve always <br/>\nbeen a TV hater.  I&#39;d live really happily without it.  We didn&#39;t have cable <br/>\nfor years, and dh and son went next door to the in-laws to watch.  I <br/>\nthought it was great not having to listen to it.  So I really understand <br/>\nwhere you&#39;re coming from if you don&#39;t like TV much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had tried to limit TV for my son, but the availability of TV next door, <br/>\nwith grandparents who weren&#39;t willing to enforce any rules about it, made <br/>\nthat impossible.  (And dh wasn&#39;t any help.  He likes watching so much, he <br/>\nmoved his office over there, so he could watch while he did his <br/>\npaperwork.)  I finally realized that not having to listen to the TV wasn&#39;t <br/>\nworth having no real family life, so we recently got a TV and cable.  All <br/>\nthat just to say I&#39;m not a TV fan.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut discussions on this list got me thinking about the whole TV issue, and <br/>\nI had already come to the point where I felt that my son was obviously <br/>\ngetting something from TV.  I even started to realize how much he learns <br/>\nfrom the TV, and he doesn&#39;t watch much stuff that&#39;s overtly <br/>\neducational.  He&#39;s not a book-learner and probably never will be.  The TV <br/>\ncertainly isn&#39;t taking him away from books.  And it&#39;s not taking him away <br/>\nfrom physical activity.  He&#39;s always majored in P.E.  &lt;g&gt;  He uses the <br/>\ncomputer a lot, spends time with friends and family, builds things, works <br/>\nfor his dad sometimes, and generally lives a pretty well-balanced life <br/>\nwithout the TV limits I would have liked to impose on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also understand that there are some kids (I&#39;d guess very few) who really <br/>\ncan&#39;t tear themselves away from the tube, no matter what.  (My <br/>\ngranddaughter *might* even be one of them.  I&#39;m not yet convinced.)  I can <br/>\nagree that these kids probably need help with it.  But I hate to see that <br/>\nas the first suggestion people get when they are concerned about the TV <br/>\nissue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of like a new mother having breastfeeding problems and being told <br/>\nfirst off that some women just aren&#39;t able to nurse their babies.  Now I <br/>\nknow it happens, but it&#39;s very rare if women are given correct advice about <br/>\nbreastfeeding.  I think it helps that new mother a lot more to help her go <br/>\nthrough all the possibilities as to what&#39;s causing the problem before even <br/>\nputting the idea into her mind that she might not be successful.  The same <br/>\nwith the TV issue.  I&#39;d love to see the people who are concerned about <br/>\ntheir kids&#39; TV watching given all the kinds of suggestions I&#39;ve seen here <br/>\nfrom time to time for helping their kids stay balanced, before they get <br/>\ntold that some kids just have to have it regulated.  Of course if the <br/>\nparent has already tried all those things, she might be really relieved to <br/>\nknow that her kid might be one of those who requires help in limiting TV, <br/>\nbut it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to start there.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling or not?","postDate":"1015985802","msgId":32332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZmMwMWMxY2EzNSQ0NWJhNGZjMCQzMjVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwZWIwMWMxYzlkYiQ0YzQ4MWRlMCQzZTM4YWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":32331,"nextInTopic":32334,"prevInTime":32331,"nextInTime":32333,"topicId":32263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Then exactly what did you mean because it wasn t just Bridget that seems to have misunderstood what you wrote.

Back in those early days, there was no one word to<br/>\ndescribe the phenomenon of children learning at home, and people<br/>\nspoke about it with a variety of words and phrases.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, the word unschooling has come to be associated with the<br/>\napproach to homeschooling that John Holt wrote about: homeschooling<br/>\nwithout following a packaged curriculum, homeschooling that follows<br/>\nthe child&#39;s interests, homeschooling with an emphasis on real-life<br/>\nactivities rather than worksheets, homeschooling in a way that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake rigid distinctions between schoolwork and the rest of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Growing Without Schooling magazine, we don&#39;t see unschooling as a<br/>\nrigidly defined concept or approach. It&#39;s certainly not something you have<br/>\nto think of as a package. Our advice to anyone reading these questions<br/>\nis that you don&#39;t have to think in terms of &quot;being unschoolers&quot; or &quot;doing<br/>\nunschooling.&quot; If any of the approaches described here appeal to you,<br/>\nthen by all means take the time to find out more, and adapt what you<br/>\nread about so that it fits your family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Buttons&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:buttonsr@...\">buttonsr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 12, 2002 4:15 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling or not?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We are unschoolers and in our home there is a lot that is &quot;required&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Regular bathing and changing of the undies (Eeew), feeding the animals,<br/>\n&gt; picking up after yourself, not eating too much junk, and so on and so on.<br/>\n&gt; To say to be a &quot;true&quot; unschooler you can not have rules is simply<br/>\n&gt; ludicrous.

Not only are some<br/>\n&gt; of the shows nasty but some commercials are also, I&#39;m not sure which are<br/>\n&gt; worse!

I dislike using &quot;homeschool&quot; because we do not &quot;school<br/>\n&gt; at home&quot; but that&#39;s just my idiosyncrasy. I don&#39;t judge others who use<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; label, knowing it&#39;s just a general label that lumps us all together - the<br/>\n&gt; school at homers, the unschoolers and everyone in between.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s our actions that show who we are, not our labels, wouldn&#39;t you agree?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Buttons<br/>\n&gt; --------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; At 1:54 AM +0000 3/12/2002, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  It&#39;s important to remember that I don&#39;t know WHAT you do, I can only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;respond to what you wrote..

That was mean<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I say &quot;your beliefs&quot; were ludicrous? No, and I was not being &quot;mean&quot; so<br/>\nget your panties out of a twist LOL. I was referring to the blanket<br/>\nstatement (see copy below) made previously.<br/>\n~&quot;When you say &quot;I require them to....do X&quot; That is in my and many other<br/>\nunschoolers opinions, not part of unschooling.&quot;~<br/>\nThat&#39;s a pretty broad statement and even one you admit to doing - you<br/>\n&quot;require&quot; that your children not do drugs, drink, lie or steal. We all have<br/>\nexpectations or requirements or rules or whatever you want to call them!<br/>\nDialect varies, since we&#39;re from different states and even different<br/>\ncountries perhaps you could be a bit more understanding and give the<br/>\nbenefit of doubt to others?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ****I was sharing what works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I also. Like I said before, if it works for you - great, your way would<br/>\nnot work for us. I&#39;m just stating my opinions which happen to differ from<br/>\nyours. I&#39;m entitled to my opinion just as you are, but who is to determine<br/>\nwhat is the &quot;right&quot; definition of unschooling? It means something different<br/>\nto different people. There is no one way to homeschool, unschool - the<br/>\ncookie cutter method is PSing, not HSing<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ***Have you tried it? Or are you assuming?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my family, you obviously do not  LOL<br/>\n:-)  You see, I&#39;m the one who has to spend time picking up and cleaning<br/>\nwhen they do not pick/clean up after themselves. It&#39;s much more fun when<br/>\neveryone pitches in because we not only work together but there&#39;s more time<br/>\nto play together. I do no want to be a martyr mom spending her day cleaning<br/>\nwhile the family entertains themselves with tv and such. I prefer we all do<br/>\nour part so we all have time to pursue our interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Do you really believe that if you didn&#39;t have rules, your pets would<br/>\nstarve<br/>\n&gt; to death? Isn&#39;t caring about another living being ENOUGH of an incentive?<br/>\n&gt; Isn&#39;t hunger enough of an incentive to buy groceries? Isn&#39;t knowledge of<br/>\n&gt; good nutrition and a desire to be healthy enough incentive? I feel sad<br/>\nwhen<br/>\n&gt; people say that they would just do nothing without rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, again, you do not know my family :-)  I will try to address your<br/>\nquestions in order:<br/>\nWhile I am a big animal lover no one else here is, some people are just not<br/>\nanimal lovers. They do not hate animals, just are very indifferent. So yes,<br/>\nthe animals literally would starve if I did not remind or do it myself.<br/>\nYes, caring is enough for me but no, it is not for the rest of the family.<br/>\nKnowledge of good nutrition does not mean they will purchase/eat good<br/>\nthings, I&#39;ve seen what my DH brings home when he shops LOL  So yes, hunger<br/>\nis incentive to shop but no, knowledge is not enough for them to purchase<br/>\nfood that is good for them.<br/>\nDon&#39;t feel sad for us. We enjoy living life and the time we get to spend<br/>\ntogether and alone. That&#39;s why we educate at home instead of PS  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Playing, reading, writing or staring at the wall<br/>\n&gt; is preferable.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ****Why? What if that&#39;s not what they want to do at the moment? If your<br/>\n&gt; child painted all day to the exclusion of all else, would this be bad?<br/>\nWhat<br/>\n&gt; if that is their &quot;thing&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis quote was snipped a little short.<br/>\nIn answer to your &quot;why?&quot; do we prefer all those things over tv watching,<br/>\nwell I don&#39;t know, that is just our taste and lifestyle. Why do you have<br/>\nthe preferences you have? (rhetorical question). We&#39;re just not big tv<br/>\nwatchers so it was never used as a babysitter and it never became a habit<br/>\nto be broken.<br/>\nWe are who we are. We (your family and mine) are different, that&#39;s life. I<br/>\nsuppose we&#39;re weird in your eyes because we prefer to do things (games,<br/>\nplay music, walk, talk etc), read something interesting or write to a<br/>\nfriend/relative (on paper or e-mail) rather than watching tv. Oh well<br/>\n(shrug), to each his/her own. Like I said before - pretty much anything<br/>\nelse, even staring at the wall, is preferable to us over tv watching. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know why you&#39;d have a problem with our tv viewing, or lack thereof.<br/>\nAs for painting all day, why would that be bad? We do what we enjoy and if<br/>\nthat&#39;s painting all day, week or month then so be it.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure by the way you phrased it if you&#39;re asking what if tv was the<br/>\n&quot;thing&quot; or if it&#39;s painting that&#39;s the thing or what you&#39;re trying to get<br/>\nacross so I&#39;ll just assume that you&#39;re asking *what* the &quot;thing&quot; is here<br/>\nLOL. At the moment the &quot;thing&quot; is an off brand &quot;Sim City&quot; type computer<br/>\ngame, that is better liked than Sim City (which I like more), and playing<br/>\nthe guitar.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; more stuff like that. When I say Rules, I mean teh typical rules of the<br/>\n&gt; house stuff like, It&#39;s Johhny&#39;s job to do the dishes every night and if<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t there is a punishnment.  If I ask for help with something (asking<br/>\n&gt; not requiring) and I don&#39;t get the help, it will take me longer to get it<br/>\n&gt; done and we may miss out on going somewhere fun. I do remind them of<br/>\nthat,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We have to be at Debra&#39;s house at noon, could someone empty the<br/>\ndishwasher<br/>\n&gt; becasue I won&#39;t have enough time before we need to leave&quot; They can say<br/>\nno,<br/>\n&gt; but if we don&#39;t get there until 12:30 and the mini-van caravan has<br/>\nalready<br/>\n&gt; left for the field trip, we&#39;re out of luck. That&#39;s a natural consequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree and disagree with some points.<br/>\nI agree with the &quot;natural consequence&quot; of if I have to do more work we<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the time for as much fun as we would have.<br/>\nI disagree with putting others in the position of being put out because of<br/>\nsomething going on in our family, such as your &quot;dishes/Debra&quot; story.<br/>\nSince I&#39;m an organized person at heart I don&#39;t wait until before an event<br/>\nto get &quot;have to&quot; things done so it&#39;s not something that we&#39;ve dealt with in<br/>\nour family. But, due to other families who use this form of consequence<br/>\nand/or punishment it has affected us to some extent. When they cancel it&#39;s<br/>\nvery frustrating and when it&#39;s repetitive it&#39;s downright discourteous. The<br/>\nnatural consequence is that people no longer make plans with them  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing that you had so many questions I hope this makes my first post a bit<br/>\nmore clear for you Elissa. Now you know me and mine just a tiny bit better!<br/>\nButtons :-)<br/>\n----------- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29703411,"authorName":"parrishml@aol.com","from":"parrishml@...","profile":"parrishmlus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling or not?","postDate":"1015965077","msgId":32322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY0LjE4MjM2Y2RlLjI5YmZiZjk1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32320,"nextInTopic":32324,"prevInTime":32321,"nextInTime":32323,"topicId":32263,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/12/2002 2:43:20 PM Eastern Standard Time, KaraBauer4@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-191893287\">In a message dated 3/12/2002 2:43:20 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KaraBauer4@...\">KaraBauer4@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Yes Elissa, we are one of them who is trying to unschool life as well (if <br/>\nthat makes any sense)... basically *to me* if I can trust that my kids are <br/>\nsmart/capable/etc enough to learn on their own, they are also smart/capable <br/>\nenough to go to bed when they are tired, eat when they are hungry, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKara and Ellissa, you both remind me of one of my favorite Holt quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All I am saying in this book can be summed up in two words: Trust Children. <br/>\nNothing could be more simple, or more difficult.

I find that whenever I assert my &quot;control&quot; over my kids, I damage that relationship. I try (KEY word!) to treat my kids as I would an adult. I always try and think in those terms. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis applies to every issue that comes up in our everyday lives. From bathing, to watching TV or playing on the computer, to eating food, cleaning, chores, personal hygiene, etc. <br/>\nExamples: <br/>\nbathing - they do not have a set bathing schedule. They take showers or baths when they feel like it. If they are particularly dirty, I will suggest that they do shower. I tell them how it&#39;s nice to look clean for others, it&#39;s important to stay clean for health reasons, and they do admit to feeling better after they take a shower and I remind them how nice that feeling is. I help them learn why it&#39;s important to bath regularly. This also applies to teeth-brushing, which they also know there is a consequence of getting cavities and also bad breath if they don&#39;t stay on top of cleaning their teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV - They watch a moderate amount of tv most days. Yes, I&#39;ll admit, it&#39;s usually when I&#39;m on the computer. &lt;g&gt; But, I don&#39;t tell my husband when or when not to watch tv. I certainly would be offended if anyone dictated my tv viewing. I want my kids to learn how to handle tv viewing on their own terms. They enjoy certain shows. They usually watch Nick the most. They DON&#39;T watch all day. It just gets too boring after a while. Then we do other things like read books, go shopping or to the library or think of some other outings. My boys love playing legos, and chess and other games. Sometimes we will get out paints or do some other crafty project. We also enjoy doing outside projects, like right now we are attempting to landscape our backyard with bricks borders and walkways and also eventually put grass in. We also enjoy gardening.<br/>\n<br/>\nComputer - The first thing my boys do when they get up in the morning is play their gameboys. They play the various Pokemon games for gameboys and are very challenged by these games. These games are very detailed and complex and I can see a lot of learning go on just by watching them. They enjoy battling each other by hooking their gameboys together. They also each have their own PC&#39;s in their room with a variety of games they like to play. Age of Empires, LegoRacers, Roller Coaster Tycoon and Flight Simulator are some of their favorites. Again, they play these for a while but certainly not all day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on about the various things that we do in our house. But the overall factor is that I have severely stopped the absolute &quot;you will do this because I said so&quot; control that I used to assert over my kids. This is the main difference of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; we started unschooling. I have to say that once I let go of MY CONTROL over these issues, they have gradually balanced themselves. And I am so proud of the way that I see this balance happening. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would never presume to say that *I* am unschooling the RIGHT way and someone else is doing it the WRONG way. All I can say is what I know has worked for our family. While I was homeschooling my kids for the previous 5 years, we were just so miserable. I was constantly in fights and battles of will with my kids. There was crying and frustration and a general ME against THEM atmosphere. Well, since unschooling, it&#39;s not that way anymore.

Back in those early days, there was no one word to describe the <br/>\nphenomenon of children learning at home, and people spoke about it with a <br/>\nvariety of words and phrases.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, the word unschooling has come to be associated with the <br/>\napproach to homeschooling that John Holt wrote about: homeschooling <br/>\nwithout following a packaged curriculum, homeschooling that follows the <br/>\nchild&#39;s interests, homeschooling with an emphasis on real-life activities <br/>\nrather than worksheets, homeschooling in a way that doesn&#39;t make rigid <br/>\ndistinctions between schoolwork and the rest of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Growing Without Schooling magazine, we don&#39;t see unschooling as a <br/>\nrigidly defined concept or approach. It&#39;s certainly not something you <br/>\nhave to think of as a package. Our advice to anyone reading these <br/>\nquestions is that you don&#39;t have to think in terms of &quot;being unschoolers&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;doing unschooling.&quot; If any of the approaches described here appeal to <br/>\nyou, then by all means take the time to find out more, and adapt what you <br/>\nread about so that it fits your family. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;People take different roads seeking <br/>\nfulfillment and happiness. Just <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re not on your road <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>\n             -H.

That was mean.<br/>\nMy kids change their underwear because when they don&#39;t they get rashes. My<br/>\nkids don&#39;t eat too much junk because I don&#39;t buy just junk, I buy a mixture<br/>\nof foods. A few junk items that they can eat mostly when they want. By<br/>\nmostly I mean if thye are getting something out of the cabinet adn it is 5<br/>\nminutes before dinner I remind them that I have made a big meal and they<br/>\nmight want to put their food on the table so they can eat it WITH thier<br/>\nmeal. I think most adults would admit to sticking a cookie or similar item<br/>\nin their mouth &#39;cause they are so hungry before dinner. To me it&#39;s the same<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n &lt;&lt;We&#39;re all different and if that works for you that&#39;s great! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n****I was sharing what works for me.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;That would not work for us. If we didn&#39;t have rules at our home we&#39;d be<br/>\nliving<br/>\nin a filthy, piled up with junk to the ceiling home with no clean clothes<br/>\nor dishes, no healthy food, and dead animals. That&#39;s not much of an<br/>\nincentive for a change here, eh?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n***Have you tried it? Or are you assuming?<br/>\nDo you really believe that if you didn&#39;t have rules, your pets would starve<br/>\nto death? Isn&#39;t caring about another living being ENOUGH of an incentive?<br/>\nIsn&#39;t hunger enough of an incentive to buy groceries? Isn&#39;t knowledge of<br/>\ngood nutrition and a desire to be healthy enough incentive? I feel sad when<br/>\npeople say that they would just do nothing without rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I wonder about the unlimited tv viewing though, is it hours and hours<br/>\ndaily<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s how your post came across to me. Are you watching it with<br/>\nthem and talking about what they&#39;re seeing?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n***I&#39;m not sure who you&#39;re asking becuse it&#39;s easy to forget exactly who<br/>\nsaid what since we have no visuals of each other but I am going to answer<br/>\nhow WE handle this. Just because TV is unlimited doesn&#39;t mean our lives<br/>\nrevolve around it. some days we do have the TV on alot, some days we don&#39;t.<br/>\nWhen I get tired of hearing the noise of TV I get involved with the kids, I<br/>\nget out the paints, I get the sidewalk chalks and we go outside (note to<br/>\nself: hit Target for chalks, Spiring is almost here!!) I play a board game<br/>\nwith them, we play Hide and go seek. But if I am answering emails, reading<br/>\nunschooling.com, cooking something that requires concentration, or painting<br/>\nmy toenails, I can&#39;t always expect my kids to think of ideas that will tear<br/>\nthem away from Rugrats. basically, in thinking, they tend to watch TV when i<br/>\nam not paying attention.<br/>\nSometimes we do watch together, DH more than me. I tend to sit with teh kids<br/>\nand watch the shows that some would think inappropriate. For example, I<br/>\nwatch Will & Grace with my daughter because the underlying theme of the show<br/>\nis human sexuality, hetero and homosexual. I want the definitions of terms<br/>\nto come from me, not for her to sit and wonder. I watch COPS with the kids<br/>\nand we talk about hte peoples choices on the show. (I love Cops!!!!)<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This is JMHO and it works for me and mine - I do not allow unlmited tv for<br/>\nthe same reason I wouldn&#39;t drop a child at a strip bar. Not only are some<br/>\nof the shows nasty but some commercials are also, I&#39;m not sure which are<br/>\nworse! Don&#39;t get me wrong, we watch some tv but there is a limit to how<br/>\nmuch and what is watched. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nI believe that TV broadens horizons and I trust that my kids will watch teh<br/>\nshows that they are ready for. Emily doesn&#39;t watch alot of videos on MTV<br/>\nwhich I agree can be &quot;nasty&quot; (I take it you mean sexually explicit?) but she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need to. Nickelodeon does TONS of videos that are aimed at the<br/>\nTweens adn teens. Emily tends to not watch the news, she&#39;ll peek in here and<br/>\nthere but I think it gets a little intense (especially now) so she tunes it<br/>\nout. Kids will not watch something that makes them uncomfortable unless<br/>\nforced to. Would you? You probably would change the channel. I trust my<br/>\nchildren to do the same.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Playing, reading, writing or staring at the wall<br/>\nis preferable.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n****Why? What if that&#39;s not what they want to do at the moment? If your<br/>\nchild painted all day to the exclusion of all else, would this be bad? What<br/>\nif that is their &quot;thing&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If I have to do away with all rules to be a &quot;real&quot; unschooler well, so be<br/>\nit,&gt;&gt;<br/>\nI have rules,<br/>\nNo doing drugs and drinking under age of majority, I am not going to jail<br/>\nfor you.<br/>\nNo stealing<br/>\nNo lying<br/>\nmore stuff like that. When I say Rules, I mean teh typical rules of the<br/>\nhouse stuff like, It&#39;s Johhny&#39;s job to do the dishes every night and if he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t there is a punishnment.  If I ask for help with something (asking<br/>\nnot requiring) and I don&#39;t get the help, it will take me longer to get it<br/>\ndone and we may miss out on going somewhere fun. I do remind them of that,<br/>\n&quot;We have to be at Debra&#39;s house at noon, could someone empty the dishwasher<br/>\nbecasue I won&#39;t have enough time before we need to leave&quot; They can say no,<br/>\nbut if we don&#39;t get there until 12:30 and the mini-van caravan has already<br/>\nleft for the field trip, we&#39;re out of luck. That&#39;s a natural consequence.<br/>\n(Here&#39;s an aside: I was at the park the otehr day and there was a big school<br/>\ngroup. the teacher said to a boy who was baout 5 feet out of line, Johnny,<br/>\nget back in line. If you can&#39;t stay in line, you won&#39;t come to the park next<br/>\ntime. That&#39;s a natural consequence.&quot; My thought: NO!, that&#39;s a punishment. A<br/>\nnatural consequence would be Johnny seperates from the group, gets lost and<br/>\nis scared and alone.)<br/>\n&lt;&lt;it&#39;s just a label and I&#39;m not big on labels anyway  :-D<br/>\nI don&#39;t use the label &quot;unschooler&quot; anyway unless I&#39;m around other<br/>\nhomeschoolers so they know what &quot;style&quot; of homeschooling we do. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nI don&#39;t homeschool. i don&#39;t school. I didn&#39;t pick the label unschooler, it<br/>\nwas given to me as a way of explaining what I and many others do.<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The general<br/>\npublic doesn&#39;t really have a clue what it means, and some homeschoolers<br/>\ndon&#39;t either.&gt;&gt;<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I use it to anyone I meet.(except my Aunt who is a second grade<br/>\nteacher, she will never understand and I don&#39;t choose to get into it with<br/>\nher.) . I want people to understand it, I want it to become the norm. or at<br/>\nthe very least a well known and respected option in education.
