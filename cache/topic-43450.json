Creative <br/>\npositions <br/>\nto be <br/>\nsure, very open about sex but not as respectful to the woman as what <br/>\nis <br/>\nculturally acceptable today.<br/>\nBUT, the line of products bearing the Kama Sutra name are incredible.<br/>\nThey are classy, high quality, intimacy products. I beleive they <br/>\nwill <br/>\nenhance <br/>\nanyone&#39;s sex life.<br/>\nThe game is very, very erotic...slow paced and brings you much <br/>\ncloser <br/>\nto your <br/>\npartner by communicating desires and so on.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m sorry for the person here that would never think of having <br/>\nany <br/>\nKama <br/>\nSutra in their house......it&#39;s actually a rather beautiful way to <br/>\npromote <br/>\ncloseness with your spouse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, don&#39;t feel sorry for me!  I am the one who said I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nthat game in my house.  I am also Catholic and don&#39;t appreciate <br/>\nanother poster implying that means I can&#39;t have fun with sex unless <br/>\nI am aimed at procreation.  A joke, maybe, but it also shows a great <br/>\nmisunderstanding of what sex means to a Catholic.  My children might <br/>\nbe raised to believe that sex outside of marriage is a sin, but that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they (or I) believe that sex must be for procreation <br/>\nonly.   I wasn&#39;t raised to believe that and my children know very <br/>\nwell that I have a stash of sexy nighties in my drawer and that <br/>\ntheir father and I enjoy closeness that includes sex more often than <br/>\nthe seven times that resulted in children!  I don&#39;t need a game <br/>\nbased on some Hindu practice to have some fun with my husband in the <br/>\nbedroom.   What being open to life means in our sexual relationship <br/>\nis that God is a part of our lives in all respects, including our <br/>\nsexual life.  We believe that God designed sex for pleasure as well <br/>\nas for procreation.   Trust me. I don&#39;t need a game or a book to get <br/>\ncreative with my husband.<br/>\n-married for 23 years, and it just keeps getting better!<br/>\nMary, IA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43308,"nextTopicId":43285}}
