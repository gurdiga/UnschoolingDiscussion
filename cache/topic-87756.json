If it&#39;s a black-faced sheep (usually raised <br/>\nfor meat), you can usually get it for really cheap.  ...and I mean, Really <br/>\ncheap.  4-H is a good source too.  You won&#39;t get the nicest quality wool by <br/>\nany means, but it&#39;s great to learn on and the price is certainly right.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to invest in a spindle, find yourself a potato spear it <br/>\nthrough the middle with a pencil or big crochet hook and twist away!  If <br/>\nyou get your thread thin and consistent, then you can make something fine <br/>\nfrom it.  If your thread is slubby, then you make something big and chunky <br/>\nand warm.  Remember once you&#39;re done spinning, loop it about your hands, <br/>\ntie it off (into a big loop), get it all wet then let it dry under some <br/>\ntension.   I don&#39;t know why that sets the twist, but it seems to and quite <br/>\nnicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry if you do it wrong.  The sheep won&#39;t care and neither will we.<br/>\nTwist away!<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;wow, 130,000 troops on the ground, nearly 500 deaths and over a billion <br/>\ndollars a day, but they caught a guy living in a hole. am i supposed to be <br/>\ndazzled?&quot;<br/>\nEmail sent by an SPC in the US Army who wishes to remain anonymous.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87432,"nextTopicId":87674}}
