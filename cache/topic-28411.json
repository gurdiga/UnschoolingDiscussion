I appreciate what people do to keep this list<br/>\ngoing  this means you, Helen Hegener, and anybody else Im not aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm going to try to contribute some new threads with interesting content.

We are surrounded by people, schoolers and <br/>\nhomeschoolers, looking at us funny because it doesn&#39;t seem to be something <br/>\nthat could possibly work.  Even if deep in our hearts we know this is right, <br/>\nsometimes we get very scared, and have very hard times believing it ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe need all the support we can get. I know that for me this list has been <br/>\nwonderful because in addition to being supported as an unschooling family, we <br/>\nhave also received support as a Lesbian family. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have recently had a big loss with the closing of Growing Without <br/>\nSchooling.  I think losing Sandra Dodd to this list is another big loss to <br/>\nmany of us, and I hope she will reconsider. (I have sent a copy of this to <br/>\nSandra.) Certainly she challenges us, and she is not always gentle. Not all <br/>\nof us agree with everything she says, or some of us, ANYTHING she says.  But <br/>\nshe make us think, and she makes us try to be our best Selves with our <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that has meant a lot to me is her willinness to be upfront <br/>\nwith her own fears. Recently she talked about being psyched and RELIEVED when <br/>\none of her children started reading a long novel. She is honest that <br/>\nsometimes this &quot;trusting children&quot; is hard on the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI urge anyone who has been challenged by Sandra (or anyone else) to take a <br/>\nbreath before responding. First, consider whether you were clear in your <br/>\noriginal communication. If the comments or criticisms seem very off-base, <br/>\nperhaps you have not made yourself as clear as you meant to.  Second, <br/>\nconsider what might be true in the challenge. Maybe you can get something <br/>\nfrom it.  Finally, try not to respond defensively. It&#39;s okay to shrug and <br/>\nsay, &quot;This is what MY family needs.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWe need all the support we can get. Sandra, I do hope you will re-join us.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn Baptista<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28407,"nextTopicId":28432}}
