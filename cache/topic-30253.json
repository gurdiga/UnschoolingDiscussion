I am the mother of 7-year-old <br/>\nunschooling twin boys.  I am also a former public high school geography <br/>\nteacher.   I have seen and experienced first-hand, the damage that years <br/>\nof schooling does to children, including myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic schools &quot;say&quot; they accommodate ADD children, but let me tell you <br/>\nit is impossible for them to do so.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for <br/>\nthem to accommodate *anyone* when teachers such as I are assigned a <br/>\nstudent load of between 150 - 190 students!  Even an elementary school <br/>\nteacher with a ratio of 1:15 can not accommodate all his/her students, <br/>\nADD or no ADD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt my high school I was what was called an Inclusion Teacher.  This <br/>\nmeans that 2 or 3 of the 6 geography classes I taught were Inclusion <br/>\nclasses.  Inclusion classes are those with between 5-15 special <br/>\neducation students (these include ADD students) learning side by side <br/>\nwith the so-called &quot;regular&quot; students.  There was usually a total of <br/>\n30-35+ students in the class.  Inclusion classes also have an extra <br/>\nteacher (special-ed certified) present in the classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very outspoken about my ideas on inclusion.  I was the only <br/>\nteacher in the whole school who was for it. I found it very offensive to <br/>\nsee special ed kids separated from the regular-ed kids.  Inclusion <br/>\nreceives a lot of resistance from the teachers because it makes them <br/>\nwork so much harder.  Unfortunately, this work I am talking about <br/>\nincludes lots and lots of documentation that has to be made to prove <br/>\nthat you have made the modifications for the special ed students.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are some of the modifications I used to accommodate my special-ed <br/>\nstudents:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t1.  Allowed them to have more time to complete their homework or <br/>\nclasswork, if they needed it (this meant I had to make a note to myself <br/>\nto remember to ask for this work at a future date - remember, I&#39;ve got <br/>\n150+ students, I can&#39;t keep this in my head!)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t2. Shorter and easier assignments (This must be noted in my grade-book)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t3. Use an easier-to-read atlas. (This is noted in their IEP <br/>\n(Individual Education Plan))<br/>\n<br/>\n\t4. Allow them to have their own book to take home if the regular-ed <br/>\nkids must use the class-room set.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t5.  Easier and shorter versions of my quizzes/tests, etc.  (this <br/>\nmeans I have to type up 2 versions of everything.  I was also an ESL <br/>\nteacher, teaching 5 different levels of ESL(English as a  Second <br/>\nLanguage) students, so I actually had 6 different versions of all my <br/>\nquizzes, tests, Classroom/Homework assignments so I could accommodate <br/>\nevery one, supposedly!)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t6. Special ed kids usually get preferential seating, usually at the <br/>\nfront of the classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t7.  More contact with the parents.  I made it a point to call 3 <br/>\nparents every day of the week.  On weekdays, I did this from home in the <br/>\nevening, after school.  I would go down my long list of students <br/>\n(special ed students were always at the top, so they got more calls) and <br/>\ntelephone the parents of students that needed extra attention.  Both <br/>\nnegative and positive calls were made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t8.  All of my students were given my home telephone number and <br/>\nemail address, in case they ever had an questions or concerns and they <br/>\nwanted to communicate with me in the evenings or on weekends.  I made an <br/>\nextra effort with my special ed kids and their parents to assure them <br/>\nthat I was always available.  I would also work in my classroom until <br/>\n5PM every afternoon.  My door would be open to anyone who needed any <br/>\nextra help in any subject, not just geography.  I also made myself <br/>\navailable during my lunch time since I usually ate in my classroom.  I <br/>\nwould allow them to eat with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved and cared for my students very much and, in a way, I miss being <br/>\na teacher.  But, let me tell you, I worked very, very hard and tried my <br/>\nbest to accommodate every one, especially my special-ed students, and I <br/>\nknow, with all certainty, that in NO WAY did I come close to <br/>\naccommodating ANY of my students the way that I know a loving, caring <br/>\nparent can!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long but I want to say one more thing.  If your son <br/>\ndecides to return to public school and he has been labeled as ADD, he <br/>\nmay be classified as a Special Ed student.  From my experience with many <br/>\nother teachers (but, not all) here in Houston, Texas, the term &quot;Special <br/>\nEd.&quot; has a negative connotation.  It is unfortunate that with many (but <br/>\nnot all) teachers, when they see that star next to a student&#39;s name <br/>\nsignifying him/her as special-ed, their reaction is immediately <br/>\nnegative.  Thoughts of disruptive behiavior and extra work for the <br/>\nteacher immediately come to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Like in any other profession, there are some very caring and good <br/>\nteachers and then there are some bad teachers.  Even though those who <br/>\ntry their very best to give everything they can to as many of their <br/>\nstudents as possible, they can not give to those children what their <br/>\nparents can give them for those 8+ hours of every day.  This is how I <br/>\nfeel about things and these have been some of my experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; living in abundance<br/>\n&gt; lovemary<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The love that you withhold is the pain that you carry - from lifetime<br/>\n&gt; to lifetime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
