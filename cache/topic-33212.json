I can remember my <br/>\nfolks angrily asking me for the reasons behind my misbehavior when I was <br/>\nlittle, and all I could come up with was, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  And, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow.  But, maybe I did or could have known.  Maybe without the pressure of <br/>\nhaving to justify my actions under duress and the threat of getting the <br/>\n&quot;belt,&quot; I could have learned more about myself in the process.  But, would <br/>\nit have been good enough to appease my angry mom and dad?  Probably <br/>\nnot.  So why even bother?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when we help our kids brainstorm to find their reasons, we are <br/>\nhelping them understand and trust themselves (and us) better, not for our <br/>\nsake but for theirs!  I *still* don&#39;t understand why I do what I do <br/>\nsometimes.  And that&#39;s because (I think) I was taught that my reasons <br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter.  I think my son (almost 8 y.o.) may have a better grip on <br/>\nhis reasons because he has not had to justify himself to me.  (Pardon the <br/>\nmuddled rambling here.

So, while your husband and <br/>\nextended family may not get it at all, your children are getting an <br/>\nexcellent education in parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it also may help to remember that we cannot control anyone else; <br/>\nthe only person we have any control over at all is ourselves.

Does it bother you that the kids are growing up and not needing like <br/>\nthey do when they are young? Do you ever think about it all or is it just a <br/>\nnatural progression with just the good memories and no sad feelings?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really would love to have another baby. My husband is the practical one <br/>\nthis time around (will wonders never cease?) and reminds me that we have <br/>\nalready out grown the house of 2 years. Plus I&#39;m getting up there in age and <br/>\nI had a hard time and almost lost Alyssa. Things that don&#39;t bother me but <br/>\nreally bother my husband. He&#39;s the one that almost didn&#39;t make it through!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy &#39;baby&#39; will be 2 in a couple of weeks and it&#39;s on my mind that although <br/>\nshe&#39;s &#39;only&#39; two, she&#39;s already two!!!! I can&#39;t imagine not having a little <br/>\none around.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and our oldest have a little joke between the two of them. <br/>\nWhenever I talk about the kids growing up, they both say that soon they&#39;ll <br/>\nbe all off to college. Then they say they better stop cause mom will start <br/>\ncrying soon!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess you answered my question but it wasn&#39;t what I wanted to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] hitting","postDate":"1033519197","msgId":45032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWMyNjlhZCRjMGZkOWM2MCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PEYxMTNQMTB4ZUo2NEhIVDg2YXIwMDAwZWI0YkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45031,"nextInTopic":45040,"prevInTime":45031,"nextInTime":45033,"topicId":33212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oppositional Defiance Disorder Myranda, what is ODD?

You&#39;re right, for most kids, I suppose. As I said in previous posts, though, my son has to have this. Before we started this, I had to literally watch him every second he was in the room with his brother, or little brother was always getting bumps, bruises, cuts, and worse. Much less work this way, and his self-control has improved in other areas since we started this. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  From: Kelli Traaseth <br/>\n  This sounds like an awful lot of work for the Mom, and not enough self <br/>\n  control from the children.<br/>\n  Parental involvement from moment to moment is necessary with children that <br/>\n  are having a problem with this, but that doesn&#39;t mean constant monitoring of <br/>\n  behavior. They&#39;ll never learn the control from within from the above <br/>\n  mentioned methods.<br/>\n  And I do not like rewarding kids with stars, hearts or other false methods of <br/>\n  control.<br/>\n  Read &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really, really like Sandra&#39;s suggestions on this.<br/>\n  I have really worked with my two middle children on how to handle things with <br/>\n  words.<br/>\n  When one of them starts a fight, I step in and start dialoguing with them <br/>\n  about how they could say it different to avoid future hurts.<br/>\n  It is slow going, but I just heard Trevor yell &quot;Sierra come pick up your crap <br/>\n  of my floor&quot; in a not very nice voice. She said &quot;you are trying to start a <br/>\n  fight&quot; and he answered &quot;please come pick up the stuff you left in here&quot;. Wow!<br/>\n  They are listening to each other&#39;s signals. They are being analytical (even <br/>\n  at five) and while I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll never have another fight, I do see <br/>\n  skills blossoming without flase rewards or constant monitoring.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!

Somewhere, light is <br/>\ndawning. Some people, and I&#39;m one of them, believe that any portal to the <br/>\nuniverse leads to the whole universe, and if that&#39;s true we should be able to <br/>\nget to everything in the whole wide world (and beyond) without much effort <br/>\nfrom something as small as, say, the definition of a word. How about <br/>\n&quot;morning&quot; and its particulars, daybreak, dawn and sunrise? <br/>\n<br/>\n Every day the sun comes up (unless you&#39;re in the Arctic or Antarctic, in <br/>\nwhich cases your sun-mileage may vary). Every day is a new opportunity. <br/>\nPeople say that all the time: &quot;It&#39;s the dawning of a new day.&quot; If you just <br/>\nlet those thoughts and truths go by, you&#39;re missing something important that <br/>\nhappens 365 days a year (sometimes with a bonus round). Don&#39;t miss important <br/>\nthings like opportunities for renewal and change. At your house it will be <br/>\nmorning again within 24 hours, but it could be morning in your heart any <br/>\nsecond. <br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;The morning of the world,&quot; someone might say, meaning just as the world was <br/>\nnew and bright. From this we and our children can talk about and learn about <br/>\npoetry and figurative speech. &quot;The morning of his life...&quot; when likening a <br/>\nlifetime to a day, with its own first light, eventual afternoon, and <br/>\ntwilight. These are common references. &quot;In Queen Victoria&#39;s day...&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n At our wedding my friends and relatives all sang &quot;Morning Has Broken,&quot; and <br/>\nit was the morning of our lives together. Later that day we had three <br/>\nchildren. Well, later meaning over the next six and a half years. Sometimes <br/>\ntime passes slowly, and sometimes it speeds by, and there is a lesson in <br/>\nfocus, and in flow, and in biochemistry. <br/>\n Some people collect bugs, or rocks, or videotapes. It&#39;s cheaper and easier <br/>\nto collect words. If you have a name which is a noun, like &quot;Lynn&quot; or &quot;Holly&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;Gill&quot; you&#39;ve probably developed an ear for hearing it and an eye for <br/>\nseeing it in various contexts and have probably looked it up in dictionaries <br/>\nand name books to see how old it is. This can be done with morning and joy <br/>\nand tree and wind. I should have put quotation marks on those, &quot;morning&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;joy&quot; and so forth, to show that I mean the word morning, not the <br/>\nthing-in-the-sky morning.   Now we&#39;re talking about punctuation, the <br/>\nmechanics of writing, and the branch of philosophy called ontology, about <br/>\nwhat &quot;being&quot; is-is the word &quot;morning&quot; part of morning itself? Is morning <br/>\ninside my head? Where does a &quot;real&quot; morning end and just talking and thinking <br/>\nabout morning start? Can you pretend morning? <br/>\n<br/>\n You can spend $20 on a Mensa-approved plastic puzzle, or a book of mind- <br/>\nbending questions, or you can just look out the window, name things, and <br/>\nthink. You can play with a dictionary, ask each other odd questions, and look <br/>\nup the answers. It&#39;s the thinking that counts, the idea-getting, the <br/>\nbiochemical ping when the light of a new concept dawns in your mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n When people begin homeschooling, that&#39;s a big bright morning, but you can <br/>\nhave as many mornings as you need. If you want to change the way you&#39;re being <br/>\nor thinking, just do it. Don&#39;t wait for another year, another month, another <br/>\nday.
