There might be many functions throughout the year where all family is <br/>\nwelcome, including extended families and all the children a place can hold.  <br/>\nCertain functions they do ask no children unless they are nursing infants, but <br/>\noften they provide a central location for all the kiddies to be supervised and <br/>\nhave a party of their own, on a much less grand scale.  My daughters often have <br/>\nentertained the children at these events.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time ever we were invited to a strictly no children event was only <br/>\nlast summer and I was somewhat surprised by it.

I replied that my children are old enough that would not be a <br/>\nconcern, then they said it was a space issue.  I didn&#39;t know these people well, <br/>\nthey were business associates of DH but he really wanted me to go, so I did.  <br/>\nMy oldest daughter tagged along.

We have only been here for about 5 years.  Both <br/>\nour families live far away.  We don&#39;t leave our boys with &quot;sitters.&quot;  I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow anyone here well enough to trust them with my children.  My youngest I <br/>\nbelieve would not go for it anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do get the &quot;you should be away from the boys more&quot; &quot;It isn&#39;t good to be <br/>\ntogether all the time&quot; which I believe is a version of &quot;they will grow up to <br/>\nbe clingy and dependent on you forever if you don&#39;t force them away.&quot;  I hate <br/>\nthat.  I usually just explain that we really enjoy each other&#39;s company and <br/>\ndoing things together.  So I have parties etc and make sure to invite friends, <br/>\ncoworkers and all the children as well.  We have great parties.  I totally <br/>\nunderstand if someone wants an all adult party though.  I just won&#39;t be there.

Specifically, I&#39;m wondering if your children are old enough<br/>\nto be alone for the duration of the party but you prefer from a parenting<br/>\nstyle to be with them?  Do your older children ever watch the youngest? Or<br/>\nif you might normally have another person stay with your youngest, but did<br/>\nnot or did not want to do that this time?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious.  I have a homeschooling teenager who has been watching my<br/>\nchildren when I have lawyer or other private appointments.  For me, it&#39;s<br/>\neasier for 3 dd&#39;s to stay at home because of dietary needs due to allergies<br/>\nand less stress while they stay in their own home environment.  Otherwise I<br/>\nmight sometimes have them visit with another homeschooling family when I<br/>\ncannot take dd&#39;s with me.   I find that we genuinely enjoy being together<br/>\nand therefore minimize the times that we are apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I&#39;m just curious to know if others enjoy the family bond in a way<br/>\nthat they make choices similar to Sandra&#39;s?  (I realize I don&#39;t know<br/>\nSandra&#39;s reasons yet, just her choice).  How often do you find that you pass<br/>\non an opportunity because it excludes one/some (based on age) or all of your<br/>\nchildren?  Who typically cares for your children at times when you<br/>\nabsolutely must fulfill an obligation without children with you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually volunteer for my children&#39;s activities such as Girl Scouts.  A<br/>\nleader can normally bring the younger children along, otherwise there would<br/>\nbe no program.  But if I go just as a mom helping out, the younger children<br/>\naren&#39;t allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken children with me at times and noticed that others seem to find<br/>\nit inappropriate.  I only have three children, but many people seem<br/>\nunaccustomed to having children around and find three extra bodies<br/>\noverwhelming.  A snooty lady in a toy store once referred to me and my<br/>\n&quot;litter&quot;.  If I or one of my children have a doctor&#39;s appointment, all four<br/>\nof us normally go.  People in waiting rooms and the doctor&#39;s staff seem a<br/>\nbit unnerve by this at times.  Sometimes the waiting rooms are not large<br/>\nenough to accomodate all.  My children are fairly young - almost 11, 8, and<br/>\n6.  I suppose it would be a bit odd for a grown woman to have three teenage<br/>\nboys tag along!  At any rate I&#39;d like to hear from others with young<br/>\nchildren as to how you handle familylife and childcare challenges.  I&#39;d also<br/>\nlike to hear from those who have older children - do you just naturally<br/>\ntransition at some point to a place/time when the children have a<br/>\nlife/schedule of their own and they don&#39;t mind being at home alone?<br/>\nThanks, AnnetteVA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76490,"nextTopicId":76507}}
