It has become a standard around our house <br/>\non Turkey Day. As you enjoy this little ditty please remember... <br/>\nWE WERE JUST KIDS!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;HENRY THE BEAK-SQUEAKIN&#39; TURKEY&quot;<br/>\n(sung to the tune of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nHenry the Beak-Squeakin&#39; turkey<br/>\n  had a very squeaky beak.<br/>\nAnd if you ever heard it, you would say it REALLY squeaked!<br/>\nAll of the other turkeys<br/>\n  gobble-gobbed and called him names.<br/>\nThey never let poor Henry play in any turkey games!<br/>\nThen one quiet Thanksgiving the Pilgrims came to say...<br/>\n&quot;Henry with your beak that squeaks, won&#39;t you be our dinner feast?&quot;<br/>\nThen how the Pilgrims stuffed him!<br/>\nWith apples, pears, and things like that.<br/>\nHenry the Beak-Squeakin&#39; Turkey<br/>\n  don&#39;t know how you lived through that!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome.
