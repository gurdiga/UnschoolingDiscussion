I also am the &#39;breadwinner&#39;<br/>\nin the family and unschool my children. My dh is an active part of this, but I&#39;m<br/>\nstill &#39;in charge&#39; and I get overwhelmed quite often. Actually, right now I&#39;m in<br/>\na major overload moment. Everything just builds up until I can&#39;t take it any<br/>\nmore. I get no time to myself. Even right now I have dh, dd, ds, and an 11 yob<br/>\nin my room with me while I try to type. I&#39;m interrupted every few moments. I<br/>\neven had to miss my bellydancing class because dh couldn&#39;t handle it this<br/>\nevening. It&#39;s only once a week for 2 hours, but I seem to miss it about 1/3 of<br/>\nthe time. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in overwhelm. I get tired of always being in charge and<br/>\ntaking care of everyone else&#39;s needs while sacrificing mine. I know this will<br/>\npass by tomorrow. I&#39;ll pull it all together and then just deal with it.<br/>\nHopefully when my kidlets get older it will be easier (they are just 2 years and<br/>\n6 months). Also adjusting to living with a needy 11 year old boy is challenging.<br/>\nWe&#39;ll get into a routine soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me sound off.

I did the juggling, and I got very good at it. The <br/>\nchildren schooled in the evening, and it accommodated to all of our needs. I <br/>\ncould not leave the office, because I was the only one working, my dh was <br/>\nbadly injured in an auto accident that we were in, and I felt that I needed <br/>\nto work. It is really sad to think of the reasons. I was driving the car, <br/>\nanother car did not stop for the stopsign, and I broadsided him. It was not <br/>\nmy fault, but I still have problems with it, I feel that I could have stopped <br/>\nor veered (which logically was impossible) The police did say that if I did <br/>\nnot decrease the speed that we were going, The other car would have hit us, <br/>\nand my daughter and husband would have been painted with me. I would never <br/>\nhave had a chance. So, I felt guilty and got a job. Dh still is making 85% of <br/>\nwages, from insurance, but guilt is a terrible thing. I did recently have it <br/>\nout with the girl who does the schedules. She started scheduling me for 2 to <br/>\n4 hour days. It isn&#39;t worth it to drive 40 minutes for 2 hours. So, she just <br/>\ntook me off the schedule, altogether. I call once a week, and she won&#39;t talk <br/>\nto me, and someone else says there are no hours. I have learned REAL QUICK <br/>\nhow to live on a shoestring budget, but my kids love having dh and I home. We <br/>\ndo lots of things, have camped all over the state, etc. MY point is that it <br/>\ncan be done, and well if you want it to. Sorry that I veered, sometimes my <br/>\nfingers get away from me..<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;tn-k4of5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"IR9q7nEBBZNnKtTc4OoYaYvCG_QSKu-rEX2I_iLCTi_zYzQnbzYV4WOG_ivHCIhJcpu2iMA9PzS6OOSdyKRX5RLfddzrQ7MkcT-zUSNVU3S80prZRaxo0ss","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Working Mom","postDate":"938064100","msgId":3204,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMjAuMzIwNC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3186,"nextInTopic":3225,"prevInTime":3203,"nextInTime":3205,"topicId":3154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
