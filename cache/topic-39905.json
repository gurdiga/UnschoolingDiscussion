It makes pet care seem like a chore on the <br/>\norder of dusting, and animals seem like.. well... furniture.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have guinea pigs, fish and a cat. I don&#39;t ask the kids to take care of <br/>\nthem. I model loving care and offer to let the kids hold, bathe, feed, or <br/>\nwhatever. Obviously, I am in charge of which pets to get, though. The kids <br/>\n(9 and 5) have often asked for a dog, but I don&#39;t want to take care of one <br/>\nand to me, it&#39;s wrong to let the care of a dog turn into fodder for <br/>\nbickering, blaming or guilt-tripping.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother surprised our kids (and especially ME) with hermit crabs and they <br/>\nslowly died in their terrarium, despite my best efforts, research on the <br/>\nInternet, books from the library, etc.  It gave me nightmares, literally.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best way to teach kids responsibility toward animals is to model <br/>\nit, showing  them that it&#39;s a responsibility for mature people .... like <br/>\ndriving a car or caring for younger kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39892,"nextTopicId":39911}}
