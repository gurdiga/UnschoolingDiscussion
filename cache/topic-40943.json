An unschooling parent is a<br/>\n&gt; facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and<br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and<br/>\n&gt; how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob<br/>\n&gt; Squarepants!

Everyone with an interest in<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>\n&gt; mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>\n&gt; designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>\n&gt; debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations.

Nancy&#39;s problems seemed to have little<br/>\nconnection to this list (even though we keep hearing that anything goes, and<br/>\nyet I&#39;ve been criticized for being off topic)  so I&#39;m still trying to<br/>\ndiscover what the real topic is, if any.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, Unschooling is not an activity, but a decision not to school our<br/>\nchildren -- not to do to them what schools do to them. Now I&#39;ll admit that<br/>\nthat is either an incredibly broad topic that includes all forms of<br/>\nchildcare (in which case I understand why there are mostly women on board)<br/>\nor it is a narrower topic, the one that concentrates on how parents need to<br/>\nunlearn their belief in the necessity for schooling. ( I was once one of<br/>\nthose people)<br/>\n<br/>\nLuz and I, long ago, went to support group meetings for homeschooling. At<br/>\nthe meetings the discussion was mostly about which curriculum they used.<br/>\nNothing wrong with that, but it didn&#39;t help us unschoolers, and most of the<br/>\nmembers couldn&#39;t imagine taking John Holt at his word, and not using school<br/>\nbooks and schedules and a notice of intent, and the rest. Luz and I wanted<br/>\nthe least possible connection to schools and/or formal schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we finally stopped going to the meetings, and while the people remained<br/>\nour friends, they perceived us as weird for unschooling, even though they<br/>\nwere pariahs in their neighborhoods for not sending their kids to the zombie<br/>\njamboree down at the corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Diane now tells us that there&#39;s a list that takes the irony a step<br/>\nfurther by calling itself pre-unschooling (!) and then entertains talk about<br/>\npre-schooling -- the exact opposite --  with the same ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you see my quandary, I&#39;m sure. I&#39;ve read in recent years that our<br/>\nlanguage has been stolen, highjacked, by our &quot;soft&quot; culture, to the extent<br/>\nthat many words now mean the opposite of what they seem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see how &quot;homeschooling&quot; now means schooling at home. But now, even<br/>\nUnschooling is perceived by many as being the same thing. Not even to<br/>\nconsider the meaning of &quot;de-schooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we to simply assume that they all mean the same thing to most people,<br/>\neven to those who are doing them?<br/>\n<br/>\nTell me, does Unschooling now mean &quot;doing school&quot;  or does it still mean, as<br/>\nI use it, finding ways to live and raise children without the methods of<br/>\nschools? For the integrity of the list, it might help to make the<br/>\ndistinction, so that people who stumble in here with the idea that the name<br/>\nactually means unschooling will not be confused, as I have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the other reason which is that, as Diane describes the<br/>\npre-unschooling list, lots of people might get the idea that the Holt<br/>\nvariety of unschooling really does not exist, so they&#39;d better get with some<br/>\nsort of schooling program after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering, not trying to offend anyone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41028,"nextTopicId":41015}}
