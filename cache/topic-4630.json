This may be true, but is impossible to evaluate,<br/>\nand impossible to separate out from effects, say, of living in homes<br/>\nmade of new building materials, or the fact that most of our food is now<br/>\nfilled with corn products (syrup and starch) to which many may have<br/>\nminor allergies. I also have no problem with people who will not<br/>\nvaccinate because they are ethically perturbed by animal testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never allow my kids to receive hep B vaccine when they were<br/>\nbabies.  It is unnecessary and, since the problem years for contracting<br/>\nhep B are ages 12-25, we don&#39;t really know whether successful<br/>\nimmunization would result.  Schools are now requiring hep B for school<br/>\nentry (even though it is relatively expensive), because they figure that<br/>\nis the time they can hang the school card over parents&#39; heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless, at ages 9 and 10, I did vaccinate my kids for hep B (and<br/>\nhep A -- we were going to India) -- there is no such thing as complete<br/>\ncontrol over teenage behavior, and hep B (and C) are much easier to<br/>\ntransmit than HIV, and can be just as lethal. As a rule, we immunize as<br/>\nlate as possible, only against conditions we figure it is likely the<br/>\nkids will encounter, and only with those vaccines which we believe<br/>\nactually work! (hence, no pertussis, or cholera), and, when given a<br/>\nchoice, only with those with the least known side effects (Salk versus<br/>\nSabin vaccine for polio.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA good rule is not to expect your doctor to explain all the options (in<br/>\nsome health systems, his &quot;quality&quot; ranking -- and hence remuneration --<br/>\nmay actually be tied to his immunization rates!)

It is very difficult to reorganize one&#39;s personal world to be that more humane place.  It<br/>\ncan be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I guess I am not ready to give up my lifestyle in exchange for homeschooling my kids.&quot; is the basic challenge.  Yes some spirited kids need particular kinds of arrangements in their lives which may be different than more relaxed, at ease, types.&quot; People do<br/>\nwhat they feel they must. and now I will say what I started to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore than anything I would like all people who are Dx with ADD ADHD to research the topic more thoroughly.  I personally believe it is a psychiatric construct with about as much usefulness as most other psychiatric constructs which is to say not a whole<br/>\nheck of a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI  think it is primarily, a pharmaceutical industry driven creation which is lining the pockets of stockholders and drugging needlessly tens of thousands of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it helps some people with alternate experiences and perceptions feel more comfortable in a world that is intolerant of diversity and shapes people for the heartless<br/>\nneeds of the military/medical/industrial/educational complex. Which services the need for power and control of a tiny fraction of the people at the expense of most people.  Hell no I won&#39;t go!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here ends the rant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this perennial topic doesn&#39;t suit people&#39;s needs on the list I would be happy to chat privately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon and Crys Meaker wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a friend on another list who has been talking about home or unschooling her kids.
