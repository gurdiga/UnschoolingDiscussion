At 5, Tim hated to color with crayons, thought coloring books were<br/>\ntotally stupid, and refused to bother making a craft that somebody else had<br/>\ndesigned.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, we&#39;ve spent many a fun day decorating sugar cookies with<br/>\nwild-colored frostings (make them yourself with food coloring and canned<br/>\nfrosting, the experimenting is fun) and playing with spray cheese and egg<br/>\nsalad, our two favorite sandwich &quot;paints&quot;.  Oh, and gingerbread houses at<br/>\nChristmas are great art projects.  Just don&#39;t call them that!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also made pretzel letters one day.  I make salt-dough clay and he models<br/>\nwith it, and he loved ooblik.  Let me know if you need recipes, I can<br/>\nprobably dig them out of someplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t push, he&#39;ll come when he&#39;s ready.  If you want to instill a love of<br/>\nliterature, love it yourself.  Listen to books out loud yourself.  You don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to make him do it, you know.  Maybe he&#39;d listen at bedtime?<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72001,"nextTopicId":72189}}
