I am SO glad I can sometimes catch a glimpse of<br/>\nthe enormity of the effects of this whole way of<br/>\nliving in such a tiny gesture, but that&#39;s the way it<br/>\nhappens, I KNOW..I just know, it is a good thing. ( I<br/>\nknow there is a quote about &#39;a world in a grain of<br/>\nsand&#39; but I can&#39;t remember where or who...).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Ted was in school, even though he was only there<br/>\nfor 2 months of kindergarten, he &#39;shut down&#39; and this<br/>\nquiet joy and &#39;ease&#39; was suddenly GONE--how scary...he<br/>\nalso ground his teeth at night and cried out in his<br/>\nsleep most nights...When Carla (no kindergarten, a fun<br/>\n1st grade for her) started 2nd grade she suddenly got<br/>\na &#39;not nice&#39; teacher and homework and a strict<br/>\nclassroom regime with shaming rules, nothing like at<br/>\nhome...I brought them home when I saw unsmiling faces<br/>\nevery day when they got off the bus.  I was SO scared.<br/>\n I didn&#39;t know it would be ok or what I would do or<br/>\nhow. I am 37, my kids are 8 and 6, I have a High<br/>\nSchool Diploma, 3 semesters of college before I<br/>\nflunked out, on purpose, my family saw I was &#39;smart<br/>\nenough&#39; to major in &#39;something good&#39; when I WANTED to<br/>\nmajor in art and history. I am one of those pagan,<br/>\nlaid-back, funky, artsy people, married to a shaming<br/>\nfamily-youngest son-catholic-raised government worker<br/>\n(&#39;deity of choice&#39;-help us)--oh shit.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat was October 2002 and I haven&#39;t done a &#39;schooly&#39;<br/>\nthing since unless the kids asked for it.
