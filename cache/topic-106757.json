It is about educating people to ditch the <br/>\nunhealthy junk food (according to Gillian McKeith) and eat lots of <br/>\nfruit, veggies, raw and wholegrains. I know there are some kids who <br/>\nhave become obsessed with only eating the right kind of food <br/>\nregardless of whether that is they wanted. For instance eating a <br/>\nwhole bunch of grapes when they&#39;d rather have some chips.<br/>\nI have struggled with food issues myself. I was vegan for 10 years <br/>\nand was bringing my kids up as strict vegans. Yes I went to parties, <br/>\ntold them the cake wasn&#39;t vegan and gave them a vegan one. If I could <br/>\ngo back I would so change that. We are more relaxed now and all are <br/>\nvegetarian. I still find it hard as my kids gravitate towards, pizza, <br/>\nstring cheese, oven fries etc. I eat home-cooked stuff but they never <br/>\nwant to try it. Maybe it will improve when they get older? It is hard <br/>\nfor me to let go. I keep thinking of the eat 5 fruit and veg a day to <br/>\navoid cancer campaign and worry for my kids adult health. I try and <br/>\nnot show it to them though and serve them the food they ask for. <br/>\nFood, can be a tricky issue for many people.<br/>\nLouise x</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106696,"nextTopicId":106725}}
