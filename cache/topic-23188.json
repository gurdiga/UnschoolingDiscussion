I am more than justified calling<br/>\n&gt; myself an unschooler even though I occasionally (I don&#39;t know, once a<br/>\n&gt; week, twice a week?) ask my kids to fill out a math sheet whenever they<br/>\n&gt; feel like it. I may even say that I want them to do it before bedtime. Or<br/>\n&gt; lunchtime. or before they can get on the computer to play. My four year<br/>\n&gt; old is just learning to read, and he LOVES to do workbooks and &#39;read&#39;<br/>\n&gt; with me. If I say &quot;hey Kyson, come here with mom and do this sheet,<br/>\n&gt; okay?&quot;, I can&#39;t be an unschooler???  to me, that is a far cry from<br/>\n&gt; forced, scheduled work.  They are not forced, not stressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I said to you, &quot;Do this before you can have lunch&quot; is that forcing you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the implication that they cannot have lunch, go to bed, or get on the<br/>\ncomputer until the &quot;work&quot; you have assigned is completed? If you say, &quot;Do<br/>\nthis before lunch&quot; and they don&#39;t, what happens? I would assume you really<br/>\ndon&#39;t withhold food or bed (maybe the computer), so what happens? Is the<br/>\nwork waiting for the the next day? Are you disappointed in them? Do you try<br/>\nto talk them into it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with an unschooled child loving to do workbooks. I<br/>\nadore word search puzzles. But when one gets assigned these things, it<br/>\nbecomes, well, an assignment. And where are we assigned learning? In school.<br/>\nErgo, schooling is not unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb said it better anyway (paraphrasing): it doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s<br/>\nassigning math or assigning cloud-watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about who has the power over their own learning. If I am<br/>\nassigning, I have the power. If my daughters are assigning themselves, THEY<br/>\nhave the power. If your workbook-loving son came to you and said, &quot;Hey Mom,<br/>\nhow about giving me some workbooks, I want to do that before lunch&quot; that&#39;s<br/>\nthe polar opposite of you saying to him, &quot;Do these before lunch&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about choices -- who has them and who makes them. It&#39;s also<br/>\nabout trust -- trust that a child will learn what he needs and wants to<br/>\nlearn when he needs and wants to learn it, not by anyone elses timetable,<br/>\njust his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that not every family is cut out for unschooling. There&#39;s no shame in<br/>\nthat. There&#39;s nothing wrong with hanging out with unschoolers, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not cut out for non-coercive parenting. I look at it and I think,<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s cool. I wish I had the temperament for that&quot;. But I don&#39;t go around<br/>\ncalling myself an NCP parent, &quot;except that I make them brush their teeth<br/>\ntwice a day&quot;. That &quot;except&quot; is everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23171,"nextTopicId":23189}}
