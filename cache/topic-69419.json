So the Dads could speak.<br/>\nPlease tape this. I really want to hear but also want the Dads to speak<br/>\nfreely. There side is important to maybe understand my own dh.<br/>\n<br/>\n    He leaves us, or me, alone on how things are handled but I really would<br/>\nlike for him to be more involved. My questions would be how do I encourage<br/>\nhim? How can I help him see and use the same respectful language and<br/>\nlifestyle without correcting him? The way he was raised has a lot to do with<br/>\nit. He won&#39;t read what I suggest. How can I help him along? Oh and he won&#39;t<br/>\ncome to the conference. I&#39;ve tryed. ;-)<br/>\n    Kelly thanks again for all you&#39;ve done. It can&#39;t be said enough. I&#39;m<br/>\nsure it&#39;s ruff on you and your family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\n&quot;Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it<br/>\nis.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>\nexcitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to<br/>\nthe holy and hidden heart of it because in the last<br/>\nanalysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is<br/>\ngrace.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Frederick Buechner, Author, in  &quot;Now and Then&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\non 5/16/03 1:24 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Date: Thu, 15 May 2003 23:43:16 EDT<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Conference-dads<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last year we had a &quot;Reluctant Dads, Reluctant Husabands&quot; presentation.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately (or fortunately???), it was attended by many women.
