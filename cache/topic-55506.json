If she <br/>\nwants to wear earings, but dosn&#39;t want to invest in gold there are <br/>\nsome options. If there is a piercing shop around you guys (a place <br/>\nthat does more than just ears) they should carry lots of different <br/>\ntypes of jewlery.<br/>\nSome of the options are, PVC (all plastic, comes in all sizes, styles <br/>\nand colors) VERY few people react to it and it&#39;s REAL cheap, just a <br/>\ncouple of dollars. Another option is Niobium (think I spelled that <br/>\nright) it is a metal but it&#39;s not a common metal and again, very few <br/>\npeople have a problem with it. It&#39;s more expensive than PVC but looks <br/>\na little nicer, it&#39;s less expensive than gold and will hold up WAY <br/>\nbetter, (It&#39;s very similer to titainium). The other option that I can <br/>\nthink of is bone. Kinda expensive, but very cool. And if her body <br/>\njust regects non-natural materials it is a way to go.<br/>\nI think that there are a few other options and a professional piercer <br/>\nwould be able to tell her what they are.<br/>\nHTH :-)<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55476,"nextTopicId":55540}}
