Rosello (Puerto Rico).  He first <br/>\ncongratulated him on winning the election,  then introduced himself, and then decried the <br/>\nfact that the mangroves where his &quot;papi&quot; (pronounced &quot;poppy&quot;--Spanish class for the day <br/>\nfolks  :~)  works and where manatees feed,  were being cut down.  He asked if there was <br/>\nanything that Gov. Rosello could do to stop it.  He also included a photo of himself in the <br/>\nletter.  (Not quite your typical activist inclusion,  but a nice touch, regardless.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe shortly received a very personal letter from the Gov.,  who commended him on being <br/>\nconcerned, at such a young age, with our environment.  He then explained in a manner <br/>\nthat I felt was very respectful, not patronizing, what he knew about the situation here <br/>\nand wrote that he was forwarding the letter to the head of the Natural and Env. Res. <br/>\ndept.   He then thanked Riali for his congratulations and for the photo, and sent <br/>\nChristmas wishes to all of us on behalf of him and his wife.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin a month,  Riali then received a letter from the head of the Nat./Env. dept., which <br/>\nagain,  was very respectively written.   The man briefly explained the history of that <br/>\nparticular project (it was a private project, not gov&#39;t) and where it stood at the time <br/>\nof the letter.  (in court)   <br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say,  Riali was thrilled with the personal responses and I think that it gave <br/>\nhim a great sense of just how accessible those in gov&#39;t can be, if they so choose.  <br/>\nUnfortunately our mangroves were destroyed,  it just seems here that the right pocket <br/>\ngets lined and then any project whatsoever gets pushed through.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My dilemma--He wants me to mail it to Hershey today to see if they <br/>\n&gt; like his &quot;invention&quot;.
