But she <br/>\n seems very angry with me. I understand that part of that is the adjustment <br/>\n to not being the baby anymore. I wonder though if she isn&#39;t upset about not <br/>\n nursing. We had a stop nursing party for her where she enjoyed telling us <br/>\n how big she was. When we go to bed together at night she always wants to <br/>\n cuddle and fondle my breasts. I ask her if she still wants to nurse and she <br/>\n says sometimes. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nMy daughter weaned herself when I was three month pregnant.  When her brother <br/>\ncome along she did great durning the first three month, but then she started <br/>\ngetting really angry and hitting me.  Around six months the anger turning <br/>\ntowards her bother.  When Matthew was born, and many months afterwards, I <br/>\nstill asked her if she would like to start nursing again.  She tried twice, <br/>\nand said &quot;Yuck&quot;  but was really happy that I offered.  In her mind, I think <br/>\nshe equated nursing with love, even though she wanted to be the really big <br/>\ngirl, a part of her wanted to still be the baby.  I noticed that if I held <br/>\nher as much as possible and as ofter as she wanted (as possible) even if I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get last nights dishes done, or a shower until my hubby came home, she <br/>\nwas more happy and less aggressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t read &quot;Siblings without Rivarly&quot; it is an excellent book.  In <br/>\nthe opening around pg 39, it talkes about how we would feel if our hubbys <br/>\nsaid &quot;Sweetheart, I love you sooooo much I have decided to have another wife&quot; <br/>\nthen proceeds to spend almost all of his time taking care her.....hmmmm I am <br/>\nfeeling jealous and angry just in that statement alone but it goes on...and <br/>\non with common statements that we used with our older baby when we bring a <br/>\nnew baby in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I feel overwhelmed sometimes just with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>my new son but it upsets me to see how angry she gets.She never acted out <br/>\nlike this before. Any advice?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe may just want you to offer, she may not even take you up on the offer, <br/>\nbut don&#39;t count on it.  Having two little ones can be overwhelming, <br/>\necspecially when you have tons of other stuff to do....I think whether you <br/>\nhave 2 children or more the advice stays the same, when you add a new baby <br/>\nget rid of everything extra you can, ask for more help from hubby or whoever, <br/>\nand simplify, simplify, simplify......so the floor doesn&#39;t get washed this <br/>\nweek, spend that extra 10 minutes cuddling the older baby....you get the <br/>\nidea....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am new to unschooling and am still having some trouble with it. My <br/>\nchildren have never been in school but we homeschooled in a fairly <br/>\ntraditional way. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimplify, simplify.....even traditional schooling is flexible and can take <br/>\nsome &quot;teacher &quot;days off.....that is one of the joys of homeschooling....you <br/>\nkids may love the free time to look for things that interest them....<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nHappy Mothering,<br/>\nJulie <br/>\nMommy to Ali and Matthew, Wife to a Great Man, Adam<br/>\nPlease check out a few of my  favorite sites:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com\">http://www.mothering.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.AttachmentParenting.org\">http://www.AttachmentParenting.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LaLecheLeague.org\">http://www.LaLecheLeague.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org\">http://www.naturalchild.org</a><br/>\n&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>\nbeing kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>\n-Peggy O&#39;Mara, Publisher of Mothering Magazine.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13722,"nextTopicId":13729}}
