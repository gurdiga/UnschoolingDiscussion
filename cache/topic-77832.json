They aren&#39;t exactly, well, when Channa (my daughter & Brianna&#39;s bio-mom) was taking almost everything out of my home, they simply didn&#39;t believe that I would testify against her - so no reports were made. She was &quot;confused&quot;. Then when she took up with a black man - they washed their hands of her - she was &quot;too far gone - forget her&quot;<br/>\nWhen Brianna & I lived in Providence, we were robbed approximately 60 times one year. She took the rugs off my floors. Brianna&#39;s earliest memory (of her bio-mom) is her bio-mom taking her snowsuit off her - in the night and giving the snowsuit and her Ernie doll to a women.<br/>\nI feel so sad when parents start dealing w/ drugs and they feel &quot;I have to really love this kid, I have to shelter this kid, I have to hold this kid.&quot; Really, all you can do is tuff love - cause believe me, love doesn&#39;t cure addiction....the whole entire family will go. You have no idea how many friends I lost because she robbed them. You have no idea how many family members simply put us aside - this has been going on for 16 years - after she robbed a few aunts - we stopped being invited or even updated about family things.<br/>\nIt&#39;s been hard - but Brianna & I are fine now.<br/>\n<br/>\nDidn&#39;t mean to go on so long.....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay if we can&#39;t emigrate there.
