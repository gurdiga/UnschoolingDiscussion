It IS crazy that we, according to our societal norms, are supposed to be <br/>\nso separated in our families, not just when the kids go off to college but <br/>\nstarting from such a young age.  So many of the &quot;experts&quot; keep telling us <br/>\nwhat is normal and healthy, yet our society becomes more abnormal and <br/>\nunhealthy even as they go in the prescribed directions.<br/>\n     It is good that many of us are finding our own better ways, healing <br/>\nourselves little by little and hopefully raising kids who are freer from the <br/>\nunhealthy influences of the rat race modern world.  Maybe the example of <br/>\nsaner lifestyles will make more and more people question the &quot;experts&quot; and <br/>\nbegin to make their own lives more sane.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13090,"nextTopicId":13095}}
