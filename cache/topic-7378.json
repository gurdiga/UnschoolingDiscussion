Well, we here in the states are also \nBombarded with&nbsp; advertising.&nbsp; Unfortunately even our PBS is picking up \ncorporate sponsers, and doing more and more advertising.&nbsp; It really gets to \nme, personally the quality or should I say LACK OF in our television \nprogramming..especially on the other 4 channels we get..it is surprising to me \nthe types of shows they show during daytime, and family time for viewing.&nbsp; \nThe constant disrepect of women &amp; all people, and war &amp; fighting &amp; \ntoy advertising...is outrageous. We have limited, and supervised viewing, simply \nbecause we don&#39;t want the exposure to things that are alterior to our goals in \nteaching our child Love &amp; respect.&nbsp; We Do however find much enjoyment \nin a vast array of programming on PBS.&nbsp; They just have alot of great shows, \nand programs.&nbsp; But we do not get cable or anything, and pbs is actually the \nONLY channel we watch.&nbsp; Occasionally we rent a movie...but that&#39;s about \nit.&nbsp; We don&#39;t even have a color t.v. We have a very ancient, and small \nblack and white.....My husbands Mother sent us a huge T.V. as a gift once..we \nwere so glad to get rid of it....we gave it away...we really didn&#39;t want this \nhuge box in our home, taking up all that space, and time.&nbsp; We often go days \nwithout turning&nbsp;our t.v. on at all.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want my son to be \ndesensitized, or myself&nbsp; for that matter.&nbsp; But I Just Love Dragon \nTails.(LOL)&nbsp;I think the most rewarding and educational activities we do is \ngo to the woods, and hike or have&nbsp; picnic, and camping &amp; \ngardening.&nbsp; These are the things that foster a Love of the environment, \nthat I see in our son so much...like the other day, when we went outside in the \nbackyard, and he sais..&quot; I love the grass, I love the sky, I love the \ntrees...Isn&#39;t it beautiful, MOM?&quot;&nbsp; Now That&#39;s quality \nprogramming&nbsp;:grins: Michelle</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7356,"nextTopicId":7350}}
