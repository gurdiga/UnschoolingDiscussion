I&#39;m jumping in! ;-) This is kind of long-sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Others get angry at the thought of a child<br/>\n </span></blockquote>being hurt or at the thought of someone judging their parenting<br/>\ntechniques.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it may be a little more than this. There is the fear that others may<br/>\ndecide to interfere with that family&#39;s life or traditions to the point where<br/>\ntheir children are actually separated from them.  There is also the anger<br/>\nthat the government sees fit to discriminate against parents for their<br/>\ndisciplinary choices (definition of abuse aside for now).<br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point:  not long after I had my second son the police were called to<br/>\nmy home by a neighbor.  My kids are LOUD. As babies, they competed with<br/>\ntrain whistles-and I am NOT exaggerating. I had my 4 year old, whom I was<br/>\npreparing to send to preschool (this was pre-homeschooling days) and my 5<br/>\nmonth old, a filthy house, a husband on his way to school that morning, and<br/>\nmy son&#39;s preschool teachers due in 20 minutes. I put on some loud music<br/>\nbecause that had the tendency to soothing the baby, and it worked for 5<br/>\nminutes, just enough time for me to get into the shower.  The baby began to<br/>\nscream.  Now, I was rushed that morning, so I couldn&#39;t have been in the<br/>\nshower more than 10 minutes tops.  When I got out of the shower, I was<br/>\nentangled in trying to dress my preschooler, clean the house, and soothe a<br/>\ncrying baby (who had reached the point of no return, which is pretty common<br/>\nfor my kids if I don&#39;t get in some early intervention)-all the while loud<br/>\nmusic is blaring while the baby I&#39;m carrying around is shrieking in my ear.<br/>\nIt was an insane morning. But glory of glories, I managed to pull it off,<br/>\nclean the house enough to look healthy, dress my son so he looked<br/>\npresentable, and put something on other than a towel.  The baby, however,<br/>\nwould not be soothed.  He cried for about 45 minutes straight. He was in a<br/>\nproper tit, as we call it around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the teachers arrived, we looked like a hallmark card-except for the<br/>\ncrying baby, but then a knock comes on the front door. Lo and behold-it&#39;s<br/>\nthe police! The neighbor had called 911 to report abuse!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was deeply offended and frightened too! One frantic morning, and I could<br/>\npossibly have my children taken away from me? Have CPS come to investigate<br/>\nme? At the very least-which is what happened-have a police officer come and<br/>\nfrighten the hoo ha out of me?!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the police and the teachers left, I took my baby over to that<br/>\nneighbor&#39;s house-since I drilled the cop and figured out who reported me-and<br/>\nbasically placed my healthy, happy but very LOUD 5 month old in their face<br/>\nand said &quot;SEE! He&#39;s healthy!! No bruises!&quot; But the damage is done.  Now, I<br/>\nhave a permanent police report filed against me of suspected abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver since then I&#39;ve been afraid that someone may misinterpret how my<br/>\nchildren act as behavior exhibited by abused kids.  What I have read on this<br/>\nlist is *not* reassuring.  From my point of view, we have to be very very<br/>\ncareful whom we accuse of child abuse.  Imo, spanking alone is not an<br/>\nindicator of child abuse, and to report someone solely on evidence of<br/>\nspanking, or yelling at a child, or a loud crying baby that will not be<br/>\nsoothed is to put that family at serious risk. Also, I suspect that having a<br/>\nCPS worker come in and investigate a family for alleged abuse based on a<br/>\nsingle spanking, yelling or crying episode would cause great damage to the<br/>\nchildren&#39;s sense of trust and stability.  Think of it-a child sees a<br/>\nstranger come into the home assessing his parents and later finds out that<br/>\nthis stranger could come and take him away from his parents and his home.<br/>\n*That* must be very reassuring.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I would ask of list members who feel that any kind of spanking is<br/>\nabuse-when do you call the police or report the child to CPS?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to give a tip for those of you who are *positive* you are<br/>\nwitnessing abuse. Don&#39;t bother calling CPS-it takes lots and lots of calls<br/>\nto get a response from them that will benefit an abused child.  Instead,<br/>\ncall the police. This way, a police record is being created (like the one<br/>\n*I* have) providing hard evidence of possible or proven abuse. I know this<br/>\nbecause we have neighbors who abuse their children regularly by neglect and<br/>\nalcoholism. I&#39;ve had the unfortunate experience of having to call the police<br/>\nto their home. As our neighbor is good friends with several police officers,<br/>\nI have assurances this is the best way to handle it.  This is not something<br/>\nI relish doing, but it *is* something I will do when I am certain abuse is<br/>\ntaking place.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care everybody, and play nice! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLee<br/>\n<br/>\n(LOL!

You have no <br/>\nright to pass such a judgement on me simply because you don&#39;t know me <br/>\nwell enough to pass that a judgement. I view that oppion of me as <br/>\nclosed minded and irrational.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to those of you who had nothing but complaints about my choice of <br/>\ntopics, how rude. I had a problem that I really wasn&#39;t sure how to <br/>\nhandle and thought that this list would be a &quot;safe&quot; place to get an <br/>\nhonest oppinion from a diversified group. Apparently I was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the latter three groups I have learned an important lesson here. <br/>\nAlthough this appeared to be an open group it apparently is not. I <br/>\nhave found much support here the past few weeks that I have been on <br/>\nthe list and will most likely continue to lurk, however, I doubt I <br/>\nwill be so quick to post especially on something that is a touchy <br/>\ntopic for myself and somewhat difficult to discuss to begin with. <br/>\nWith all this said I do respect each  person&#39;s right to their <br/>\noppinion. That doesn&#39;t mean I do/have to agree/like that opinion. <br/>\nCorallyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pris","from":"&quot;Pris&quot; &lt;x_t_sipr@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ldtLxl8uWpzW9QZDD3JMlv6Ar5bs9p67lRRoFM-Gtf3df8HV9CwkwH32usvhGjXyjLOZg9eaUFtOajs6nIh1Nnmgygb1Bfg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Differences with DH","postDate":"967923655","msgId":12453,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZDMwMWMwMTUxNSRiNmUyZmU4MCQ1MmNmOGFkMUB0ZXhhcy5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDRhLmE2YzFmYWUuMjZlMmIxMjhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12452,"nextInTopic":12475,"prevInTime":12452,"nextInTime":12454,"topicId":12402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"me, too ...

Corallyn<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been with the same man for 25+ years, married for 23.  We have an <br/>\nestablished relationship.  One grown son, daughter-in-law, 2 yr old grand <br/>\ndaughter and a 12 yr old son.  I list the &#39;credentials&#39; to let you know that <br/>\nthis is a life journey and I&#39;ve come a long way, learning new things as I go.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, my personal opinion...I don&#39;t spank.  I did with my oldest.  In <br/>\nfact, your description of what happened in the mall is very typical of what I <br/>\nwould have done with my oldest son.  I learned that it made me feel too icky <br/>\nand so I have worked very hard to find alternative methods.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA note of explanation here, I was raised in a very abusive family, so any <br/>\nform of corporal punishment, yelling or signs of anger really hurt me.  Many <br/>\npeople think I over react to these situations...my DH is one of them.  While <br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you&#39;re abusive, my parents used similar approaches; beating us <br/>\nand then telling us a) it was our fault and b) they only did it because they <br/>\n&#39;loved&#39; us and c) it was their responsibility to see that learned to avoid <br/>\nsin so I would not go to hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I am NOT accusing you of abuse.  I just want to preface my methods by <br/>\nsharing my experiences so you can see that this comes from the bottom of my <br/>\nheart.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I felt so awful and out of control any time we spanked, we decided <br/>\nthat spanking was not an appropriate form of punishment or discipline in our <br/>\nfamily.  Even before we made that decision, we were careful to never be out <br/>\nof control.  If we felt there was any anger or danger of abuse we sent ds to <br/>\nhis room until we could calm down enough to deal with it.  I still felt <br/>\nawful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith ds #2 (10 yrs later), we had tried so hard to bring this child into our <br/>\nlives and had such heartache in the process (miscarriage, tubal pregnancy and <br/>\nmany months of failed fertility treatment) that the idea of striking him in <br/>\nany way was repulsive.  Interestingly enough, the process of getting ds #2 <br/>\nhere, also softened our hearts considerably in our dealings with ds #1.  The <br/>\nmost that ds #2 has received was the very occasional swat.  Then it was when <br/>\nI could not get words out fast enough to stop dangerous behavior.  i.e. he <br/>\nwas about to grab a sharp knife.  On those occasions we have really had to <br/>\nlaugh because his reaction was to stand up straight, grab his buns and look <br/>\nat us with a look that said &#39;what did you do that for?!&#39;  There was obviously <br/>\nno real pain involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on to solutions...DH does not feel as strongly about this as I do.  He <br/>\ndoes not see spanking as abusive or coercive.  I&#39;m the one that is around the <br/>\nkids all the time.  DH is often out of town for weeks or months, so there <br/>\nhave been times that I am, essentially, a single parent.  When DH would come <br/>\nhome, he would automatically assume things would fit his expectations without <br/>\nit even occurring to him that I might be doing things another way or that <br/>\nchanging the routine the rest of the family had established would be <br/>\ndisruptive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I sat down with DH and explained that in his absence, this was how I did <br/>\nthings.  That I certainly did not want him to feel like he was a visitor in <br/>\nhis own home, but it would help us a lot if he could let us know what he <br/>\nexpected, we could establish some rules we could all live with and each of us <br/>\nwould need to use extra patience in learning/remembering what it was we were <br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then went on to explain how awful it made me feel when there is any yelling <br/>\nor spanking going on.  Explaining that it dredged up my childhood and caused <br/>\nme to relive that pain every time it happened in our home.  That it took away <br/>\nfrom my happiness when we had this contention.  I had to explain this on more <br/>\nthan one occasion.  Since he loves me and there are other ways to discipline, <br/>\nhe has learned to find alternatives or use the ones I already have in place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the rare occasion that DH strongly feels that more needs to be done and <br/>\nthe child has gotten off too easy (which hardly happens, it&#39;s not like I just <br/>\nlet them run over me!), DH and I excuse the child and explain that mommy and <br/>\ndaddy need to discuss this.  Go wait at the kitchen table/in your room/where <br/>\never until we are ready to talk to you.  Then we hash out what is needed and <br/>\ngo from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel it is important for there to be a united front.  That does NOT mean <br/>\nthat dad has to discipline using the exact same form of consequence that mom <br/>\nuses.  It does mean that DH and I have set limits for our family which we are <br/>\neach comfortable with.  When DH says the consequence for &#39;X&#39; is &quot;Y&quot;, I back <br/>\nhim up and he does the same for me.  If a child thinks it is too harsh, they <br/>\nhave to work it out with the parent that is handling that episode.  This <br/>\nkeeps them from playing us against each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n(A funny note:  We have a family rule concerning our activities on Sunday.  <br/>\nWe do not shop or engage in heavy labor, with rare exceptions.  It is our day <br/>\nof worship.  Last week DH simply HAD to work on the car.  DS #2 came out and <br/>\nasked DH why he was working on the car.  DH gave his answer and went on <br/>\nworking.  Then DS #2 came inside and asked me why dad was working on the car. <br/>\n I gave him an answer.  DS&#39;s response:  That&#39;s just what Dad said!  I really <br/>\nhad to laugh...that&#39;ll learn him to even consider pitting us against each <br/>\nother.  LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is long.  I&#39;ve given background in order to help you know if this <br/>\nis a solution that will work for your family.  It has been an ongoing process <br/>\nfor our family.  DH sometimes still gets forceful with DS or (more often) <br/>\nwith the pets.  It doesn&#39;t take more than a cleared throat or my speaking <br/>\nDH&#39;s name and he checks himself to see if he is out of control.  Knowing that <br/>\nDH pauses to consider his actions helps reassure me and also helps DH decide <br/>\nwhether he is behaving appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"qdUo_ZwpDCcxpmbybFHz3QHpW5H-ru-dgrOCaFMDdc13r44-NCwyP891PHuHLJiJdBcudlLU-dFTtwjtQH1hZu0sjw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Differences with DH","postDate":"967916093","msgId":12439,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwOTAyMTgwOS5lODJJOXRiMTU4OTVAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":12425,"nextInTopic":12450,"prevInTime":12438,"nextInTime":12440,"topicId":12402,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, like a few others, I don t think that corporal punishment is an unschooling issue, it is a parenting issue and a very volitile one!

He thinks that we need to use more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; corporal punishment in the form of a switch, that the hand isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough. Not that I use my hand often, but I do believe there is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time and a place for it and it is always a last resort. The last time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and only time that I seriously used my hand on either of the children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was when DS ran off in the mall and I couldn&#39;t find him. He was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; almost 4 at the time. Anyway, to make a long story short, I had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; security looking for him for 15-20 min. When they found him I bawled<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like a baby, held him in my arms then took him to the bathroom and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spanked his bare bum till my hand hurt, not out of anger but out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; love. I wanted him to understand how serious it is that he not run<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; off like that. Then I explained to him how scared I was and how much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I loved him and sat there in the stall just holding him close for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while. Needless to say he has never run off in any store again.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as DH and I go I have always believed more in the lines of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Love and Logic and DH believes more along the lines of coersion and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; force much like the ps uses.

We owe it to ourselves as parents and have the moral OBLIGATION<br/>\nto constantly scrutinize ourselves and our choices to ensure we are<br/>\nalways offering our children the VERY BEST we can give.  To not discuss<br/>\nthese very personal topics amongst other parents from whom we may learn,<br/>\nis to deny the most basic resource we have for education...each other!<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless where one stands on the spanking issue, I think few would<br/>\nargue that corporal punishment with actual &quot;weapons&quot; (ie. belts,<br/>\nswitches, rods etc.) is excessive.  That IS abuse.  Ask any doctor,<br/>\nlawyer, social worker, or parenting expert.  Some extremist religious<br/>\ngroups defend the use of &quot;weapons&quot; based on misinterpretation of<br/>\nscripture.  My husband is a clergyman (and a &quot;traditional&quot; one at that!)<br/>\nand this question comes up regularly.  We also have concerns over a<br/>\n&quot;bare bottom&quot; spanking as it can confuse a child sexually and especially<br/>\nfor an older child is further humiliation that can go beyond repair. <br/>\nThis is by far NOT what God intended for his greatest gifts - children! <br/>\nAnd for those non-religious types who exert control by means of corporal<br/>\npunishment, it happens either simply from lack of knowledge or because<br/>\n&quot;it was done to them when they were a kid&quot;.  The real issue here is not<br/>\nthat of disciplining a child so much as it is about an adult raging and<br/>\nneeding some anger management assistance.  Sure kids defy authority, and<br/>\nsure parents get darned frustrated, and there&#39;s no argument that<br/>\nparenting is the toughest job out there, but excessively attacking<br/>\nchildren only creates resentment and breaks down families.  The day<br/>\ninevitably comes when the bomb explodes and the so-called discipline<br/>\nbackfires in the parent&#39;s face, one way or another.  It happens every<br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not meaning to insult or judge your situation Corallyn, and my heart<br/>\ngoes out to you if you are in a situation of conflict to resolve this<br/>\nwith your husband and family.  The answers won&#39;t be easy...they never<br/>\nare for the really tough and worthwhile questions.  I know it&#39;s easier<br/>\nsaid than done but would your husband entertain talking to someone about<br/>\nthis?  He can get some answers to his parenting questions through<br/>\ncommunity parenting groups, a health clinic, the library, or other<br/>\nparents etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbove all else, since you are as you said, &quot;the primary care giver to<br/>\nyour children&quot;, show your babies unconditional love.  Hug and kiss each<br/>\nof them every day so they have a sense of security and stability.  That<br/>\nwill be your greatest disciplinary tool.  Try not to have unrealistic<br/>\nexpectations of yourself or your children.  They ARE children after all<br/>\nbecause they do make mistakes when they are learning and growing and not<br/>\nevery mistake needs necessarily to be disciplined.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I haven&#39;t offended you.  I support and respect you or any other<br/>\nparent who is willing to learn and self-improve.  I know this is an<br/>\nissue some people don&#39;t want to touch on this list but I wanted to<br/>\nrepond to your question.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the one great thing I like more than just about anything else on<br/>\nthis list.  I LOVE having the resource of so many other parents to learn<br/>\nfrom and to receive support from.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia in Saskatoon<br/>\n(mom to 3)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCorallyn wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay so DH and I have very different veiws on how to handle certain<br/>\n&gt; situations with the children.
