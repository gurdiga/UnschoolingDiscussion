It was three <br/>\nmonths of hell.  It took me years to open my heart up to another <br/>\nanimal.  We still had our Tigger (who is now a 16 year old <br/>\nMalamute/Shepard cross).  Tigger is doing great, but not a day goes by I <br/>\ndon&#39;t worry about him being so old and having to undergo the pain of <br/>\ndeath again.
