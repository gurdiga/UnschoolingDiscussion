My kids were all in school, (I<br/>\nhave four kids).  But I did not feel it was how I wanted to live.  The<br/>\nonly problem was, I had homeschooled before but always felt like a<br/>\nfailure.  I had mostly homeschooled my oldest because he was energetic<br/>\nand expressive in ways that didn&#39;t suit the teachers.  Homeschooling<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work for me because I always felt like I was supposed to make my<br/>\nkids do so much work on so many subjects, just like at school.  Then they<br/>\neither wouldn&#39;t do it, or they would do it but later on tests wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nremember it.  I would see other moms who were probably unschoolers who<br/>\nsaid they let their kids find their own curriculum.  I thought, &quot;Man,<br/>\nthese moms really have their act together.  I could never be that smart.&quot;<br/>\n But, when I read that book at the library called The Teenage Liberation<br/>\nHandbook, my eyes were opened.  It doesn&#39;t take a lot of smarts, or<br/>\norganizational skills, it just takes listening to the children like they<br/>\nare important individuals with a mind of their own and dreams of their<br/>\nown.  Which of course, they are.  I remember how much passion I had for<br/>\nmusic growing up, yet my parents never noticed that I was passionately in<br/>\nlove with music.  So, I floundered along doing school when all I really<br/>\nwas interested in was writing, reading, foreign languages and music.  The<br/>\nmost learning I got in music was from choir.  Yet, I wanted to learn<br/>\ninstruments.  I lived with my sister for a while and she had a piano so I<br/>\npaid for lessons with my babysitting money.  My piano teacher encouraged<br/>\nme to continue since I had a talent for it.  But when I moved, we had no<br/>\npiano and no one would pay for lessons.  I would have taught myself if I<br/>\nhad even known it was possible.  School had taught me that I could only<br/>\ndo what I was told, not what I sought out and figured out on my own.  If<br/>\nmy parents would have paid for my music lessons, bought a piano (or<br/>\nhelped me figure out how to find one to use or pay for one myself), then<br/>\nturned me loose at the library, I would have been perfectly happy.<br/>\nAnyway, along with unschooling came a whole new thought system.  I had to<br/>\nreally see my children as the wonder that they are.  To really listen. <br/>\nAnd with that came the realization that I have tried to conform them to a<br/>\nfalse standard of acceptability.  I have had to change my thinking that<br/>\nthe parent&#39;s job is to control the children.  The adversarial<br/>\nrelationship is no more.  Now we have communication.  I have had to read<br/>\nmany books, because it is hard to grasp some of these new concepts.  So,<br/>\nI have been unschooling myself as well.<br/>\nToday I was getting ready to go somewhere, and babysitting.  I enlisted<br/>\nthe help of two of my sons to straighten up a bit.  I asked my oldest to<br/>\nclean the kitchen-it wasn&#39;t very messy.  He whined and said he had<br/>\ncleaned it yesterday.  I said, &quot;Well, what would you prefer to clean?&quot; <br/>\nHe chose the living/dining area.  My younger son cleaned the kitchen, but<br/>\nI noticed he was goofing off when it came time to do the dishes.  I<br/>\nthought maybe he did not understand how to do them, so, holding the baby,<br/>\nI went in and said I would guide him to show him how to do it.  He said,<br/>\n&quot;I already know how to do it, Mom.  I just hate to clean the dishes.&quot;  I<br/>\nsaid, &quot;What do you like to clean?&quot;  He said, &quot;I like to pick up things<br/>\nand put them away, but I hate to wash the dishes.&quot;  So, he picked up the<br/>\ndirty dishes and put away the clean ones, then I buckled the baby in the<br/>\nstroller and washed them.<br/>\nNow, here is how it would have happened in the past.  I ask for help. <br/>\nKids whine or do half-hearted job.  I whine or put-down kids.  Either I<br/>\njust give up,(forget it, I&#39;ll do it), or I get mad(power struggle).  Kids<br/>\nlose &#39;cause I&#39;m bigger or I lose &#39;cause kids have more energy. <br/>\nNow I&#39;m not discouraged by their whines or their body language that says<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to do what you want me to do.&quot;  Now, we talk about it.  I<br/>\nsee their whining or their body language not as a challenge to my<br/>\nauthority but as an attempt to communicate.  It is an opportunity to<br/>\nreally listen.<br/>\nThis is what unschooling has done for me in less than a year.  Life is so<br/>\nmuch more pleasant.  I absolutely love it!<br/>\nBonni<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello","postDate":"1018143086","msgId":34154,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4RDUwNUI5LjZENTQlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3OS42NTUzMjM3LjI5ZGY3ZGU3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34144,"nextInTopic":34157,"prevInTime":34153,"nextInTime":34155,"topicId":911,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s a way of living<br/>\nlife. :-) It isn&#39;t leading them somewhere. It&#39;s helping them grow into who<br/>\nthey are and who they will become, rather than who society insists they<br/>\nshould become.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you make sure to teach them English? Or was English a useful tool they<br/>\nused while living their lives? There are skills that adults find useful<br/>\n(speaking, reading, arithmetic) and your job is to make sure they&#39;re useful<br/>\nto your kids at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow, you&#39;re probably asking ;-) By recognizing that, like English, reading<br/>\nand arithmetic and geography and history and everything is part of life.<br/>\nThere really is no separate entity called &quot;history&quot; or &quot;science&quot;. It&#39;s just<br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey learn to read because they find it useful and because they have<br/>\npleasant associations with it. (Snuggling up reading in bed, listening to<br/>\nbooks on tape, gaming guides and so forth.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey learn math because people around them speak math and it&#39;s a handy and<br/>\nfascinating tool. Speaking math means figuring out the answers to questions<br/>\nout loud.:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How long until Daddy gets home?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Well, it&#39;s 3 now and Daddy gets home at 6 so&quot; counting on fingers &quot;3 to 4<br/>\nis one hour, 4 to 5 is another, 5 to 6 is another. So 3 hours.&quot; And I<br/>\nusually converted that into number of favorite half hour shows since that<br/>\nwas a familiar chunk of time and it immerses them in fractions and<br/>\nmultiplication too. &quot;There are 2 Magic Schoolbuses in an hour, so 3 2&#39;s is 6<br/>\nMagic Schoolbuses until he gets home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, &quot;How long until Christmas?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Well, it&#39;s April now and Christmas is in December.&quot; counting on fingers<br/>\n&quot;April, May, June, July, August, September, October, Novermber, December, so<br/>\n9 months. Each month has 4 weeks. And 9 4&#39;s is 36.&quot; (Or you could do days.<br/>\nOr be more exact as they get older and as Christmas gets nearer.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, &quot;I&#39;ve got 58 cents and I found a quarter. Do I have enough for the $1<br/>\nbaseball card pack yet?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Well, 2 from the 25 gets the 58 up to 60, so we&#39;ve got 60 + 20 + 3 or 83<br/>\ncents. Which is 7 to get the 83 up to 90 and 10 to get the 90 up to 100, so<br/>\nyou need 17 more cents.&quot; (That&#39;s *one* way of breaking up the problem.<br/>\nThere&#39;s oodles of ways. I think it&#39;s vitally important to avoid pencil and<br/>\npaper math -- unless they like it of course! Break problems up in your head<br/>\nso you can solve them outloud. That way kids can see how numbers work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t need to fully grasp it, just get the jist of it. Just as they<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand every word we use. They just get the sense of what we&#39;re<br/>\nsaying from the words they do understand. But the presence of the words (and<br/>\nthe math concepts) they don&#39;t fully understand are just as important as the<br/>\nwords they do understand because they&#39;re in the process of understanding<br/>\nthem. They can&#39;t acquire new words unless they&#39;re available.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory is reading books and watching movies set in the past. And then<br/>\ntalking about how their lives were different, perhaps immediately, perhaps a<br/>\nmonth later, whenever they ask. Usually kids will be more fascinated by the<br/>\nphysical aspects (bathrooms, eating, traveling) when they&#39;re young. Later<br/>\nthe social aspects. (Back then there were very very few women doctors<br/>\nbecause society thought women shouldn&#39;t work outside the home.) And still<br/>\nlater the political aspects. (Teddy Roosevelt was president then and he had<br/>\ndifferent ideas about how the country should be run.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(But none of that is a given. They may only want to hear stories set in the<br/>\nhere and now. They may grasp politics at 5. ;-) Whatever they&#39;re drawn to is<br/>\nwhat&#39;s right for them. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just want them to be happy and enjoy learning because I remember when I was<br/>\n&gt; in school and I didn&#39;t want to do my work because either it was to hard or to<br/>\n&gt; easy or I was just bored.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And the way to enjoy learning is by pursuing what interests them, and being<br/>\nable to stumble across new things that are intriging. (And just as<br/>\nimportant, being able to explore something only for a moment, or ignore<br/>\nsomething they don&#39;t find fascinating yet.

If you hold onto the idea<br/>\nthat schools have an exclusive monopoly on what constitutes a proper<br/>\neducation then unschooling will frustrate you. If you can embrace a new<br/>\nmodel of &quot;proper education&quot; as helping your children become themselves then<br/>\nyou&#39;ll all do great :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 4 and it is hard for him to just set<br/>\n&gt; still for that long of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a very active folder at the Unschooling.com website, Unschooling and<br/>\nSpecial Needs Children<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/603/603.html?FridayApril52002122\">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/603/603.html?FridayApril52002122</a><br/>\n6pm).

Things went <br/>\ndownhill rapidly and when my parents realized how unhappy I was they <br/>\nsaid if I was bright enough to skip a whole grade I was bright enough <br/>\nto take charge of my own learning and so I did. Of course it didn&#39;t <br/>\ntake long for my brother to decide he&#39;d rather skip going to school <br/>\ntoo and that was okay with Mom and Dad. My youngest brother and <br/>\nsister (now in their late 30&#39;s) never went to school at all because <br/>\nby the time they came along our folks had figured out that schooling <br/>\nisn&#39;t all that important in assuring a child&#39;s true happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;        I hope no one takes offence to these questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No way - that&#39;s what this list is here for!<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39349311,"authorName":"BabySCKwak@aol.com","from":"BabySCKwak@...","profile":"babysckwak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hello","postDate":"1018124407","msgId":34139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxLjFiMWQ2NDdjLjI5ZTBiMjc3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34137,"nextInTopic":34144,"prevInTime":34138,"nextInTime":34140,"topicId":911,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I have a few questions please.

I was on this list awhile back, but I couldn&#39;t take the volume of<br/>\ne-mails.  I am trying it again, since I have a little more time to read.  I<br/>\nam a Christian and an  unschooler.  My kids are 5 and 7 and we have always<br/>\nunschooled.  I came to unschooling much like you did.  I first read &quot;A<br/>\nPatchwork of Days&quot; by Nancy Lande.  Then I moved on the &quot;The Charlotte Mason<br/>\nCompanion&quot; and finally to John Holt&#39;s &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;, among other works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally feel that how our children learn has nothing to do with my<br/>\nfaith.  I value  the unschooling lists I am on  because they are the only<br/>\nsupport I have for this way of life.  I am not really a part of a real life<br/>\nsupport group on a regular basis, but I do some activities with a local<br/>\nChristian group of a different denomination.  (My sil is part of the group)<br/>\nI have shared what we do with a few people who have asked and I have gotten<br/>\na fairly positive response.  Two people said that they should try playing<br/>\nmore games with their kids instead of battling the workbooks.  I certainly<br/>\nteach my children about God and Jesus, but I will never keep them from<br/>\nlearning about other faiths.  When it comes right down to it, you have a<br/>\nstronger faith when you have explored all the other options and still<br/>\nbelieve.  I actually enjoy learning about other faiths and cultures.<br/>\n<br/>\nO.K. about the quick intro. I mentioned.....I am Angela (insatiably<br/>\ncurious), Unschooling Mom to Leigh (7) and Lilly (5).  We live on a<br/>\nwant-to-be farm in Maine with a myriad of animals.  (cats, goats, guinea<br/>\npigs, hamster, rabbit, fish, laying hens)  Leigh loves cats and board games,<br/>\ntakes quite awhile to warm up to new people, and is quirky and sweet.  Lilly<br/>\nloves to pretend more than anything.  She is learning to read and also likes<br/>\nboard games.  Her favorite pets are the guinea pigs.  She is cuddly and<br/>\ncute.  And of course both are very bright!!  (I can say that, I am their<br/>\nmom!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly believe in unschooling, however I still get the doubts now and<br/>\nthen.  Should I make them read to me so they improve more quickly?  Will<br/>\nthey ever choose to do anything that is difficult  and not fun on their own?<br/>\nDo I care what other people think?  I do know the answer to these questions,<br/>\nyet they still plague me now and then; esp.. after talking with other people<br/>\nwho doubt what I say.  My mom is generally supportive, yet the other day she<br/>\nasked me if I thought there would ever come a day when I had to make them do<br/>\nsomething they don&#39;t want.  I take life one day at a time.  If I ever get to<br/>\nthe point where I feel that I must force them to learn, I will deal with it<br/>\nthen.  For right now, what we are doing is working fine.  When I start to<br/>\nquestion myself, I journal what they are doing more.  This definitely helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, being unschooling Christians works for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in Maine<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling@...\">unschooling@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy Unschooling Page!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/autonomousangela\">http://www.geocities.com/autonomousangela</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.&quot;  -<br/>\nWilliam Butler Yeats<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90268604,"authorName":"Nichoel","from":"&quot;Nichoel&quot; &lt;stormyrain73@...&gt;","profile":"nichoel1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello","postDate":"1010766280","msgId":31002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzgwMWMxOWFiYyQ3OGM5YmEyMCRhYzAwZTUwY0BhdHRiaS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PFBHRUZKT0JOTklDRUJKSEpLUEtQQ0VBSkNKQUEuTGVzbGllTW95ZXJAZ2VvdGVjLm5ldD4gPDAwMGUwMWMxOWE4MCRiOTJmZTYyMCQ1NWNlMDdjNEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4gPDAwODUwMWMxOWE5ZiQ5NmRiMGMyMCQzODhiZTIzZkBsYW5kZT4="},"prevInTopic":30990,"nextInTopic":31021,"prevInTime":31001,"nextInTime":31003,"topicId":911,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is new book out called Christian Unschooling; it s by Teri Brown and Elissa Wahl..I m still waiting to get it but someone had passed the book title on to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2026414110\">There is new book out called Christian Unschooling; it&#39;s by Teri Brown and Elissa Wahl..I&#39;m still waiting to get it but someone had passed the book title on to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNichoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFertility Friend Online Support Guide <br/>\nNow you CAN conceive online..<br/>\nwww.fertilityfriend.com/sm/21749/<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Loy & Elaine Switzer <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, January 11, 2002 4:57 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello Cathy,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have come to a peaceful place knowing that I can be a Christian and an unschooler too.
