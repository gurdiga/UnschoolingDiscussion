Just<br/>\ntake two half-gallon milk cartons, rinse them very thoroughly and wash with<br/>\nsoap, open up one end all the way on each carton, and push one of them all<br/>\nthe into the other one. Voila! you&#39;ve got a big building block that is<br/>\nlightweight and versatile. My son uses these big &quot;bricks&quot; to build all sorts<br/>\nof things in his room from tunnels for his trains to forts. The best thing<br/>\nabout them is they can get crushed, broken, etc. and we just make a new one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So I really do not have any doubts as far as the academics go, but I do<br/>\n&gt; wonder about the social development.

And I suppose these people<br/>\nknow so many &quot;odd maladapted&quot; homeschooled adults themselves?? Snort.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a list on the internet, I think it&#39;s on the &quot;School is Dead, Learn<br/>\nin Freedom&quot; site that lists all the famous homeschoolers, starting with<br/>\nalmost every one of our founding fathers (here in the U.S.). That&#39;s always a<br/>\ngood thing to have floating around in your head when you need to counter<br/>\nthis argument.<br/>\nLong before I even had kids, I was a church youth group leader and I have to<br/>\nsay that the homeschooled teenagers I worked with got along great with their<br/>\npeers. The only difference between them and the schooled kids is that they<br/>\nwere also able to carry on meaningful conversations with me (an adult)<br/>\nwithout reverting to either subservience or rebellion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do you do to ensure that your child&#39;s social development does not<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fall<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; behind his peers at school??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The real question is what could I possibly do to my child so that their<br/>\nsocial development was as bad as a kid who has been in school?? Kids in<br/>\nschool are &quot;socialized&quot; into a very narrow peer group, a group that, because<br/>\nof its uniformity, causes strange cliques, pressures, and rules of<br/>\nconformity to occur. Homeschooled kids are socialized into the real world,<br/>\nwhere people of all ages work together, where you have value because of what<br/>\nyou do and who you are, not because you have the exact right pair of jeans<br/>\nfrom The Gap, where you have freedom to choose many different paths instead<br/>\nof a narrow set of social rules. In my day in highschool, you could be a<br/>\n&quot;socie&quot;, a &quot;jock&quot; a &quot;doper&quot;, a &quot;punk&quot;, a &quot;nerd&quot;, or just plain labeled<br/>\n&quot;weird&quot;, That was the sum total of your options. In the real<br/>\nworld, you can just be you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line (to me) - let your kids pick their interests, help them<br/>\nfollow through on them, and chances are about 100% that these interests will<br/>\ntake them out into the world where they will interact with all kinds of<br/>\npeople, and become the truly social members of society that I would hope all<br/>\nkids had the opportunity to become.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;An archeologist is someone interested in old<br/>\nbones, like Grandma&#39;s!!&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who her brother calls &quot;turbo baby&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15186,"nextTopicId":15193}}
