He spent grades K,1,2&3 in public <br/>\nschool, then we had a wonderful time while he was 9 and 10, exploring the bay <br/>\narea and reading and just having a good time. Trouble is, we live in a very <br/>\nsmall town and there are no other kids near us. Even tho&#39;  he was involved in <br/>\nactivities outside the house, he very rarely interacted with other kids. They <br/>\nlacked the familiarity of the kids he grew up with in public school. (may him <br/>\nbeing mildly autistic has something to do with that)<br/>\nAnyway, although I would be much happier to have him home, he is adament that <br/>\nhe will stay in school. I just moniter things by staying in close contact <br/>\nwith his teacher and principal. So please don&#39;t think that people who are in <br/>\npublic school don&#39;t know how to learn other ways, for some people, routine is <br/>\nessential and comforting. For now we&#39;ll keep things &quot;as-is&quot;.<br/>\njust my 2 cents<br/>\nNancy S., who hasn&#39;t posted in a long time, but still reads your pearls of <br/>\nwisdom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60065,"nextTopicId":60260}}
