I see that feelings inadequecy <br/>\nand questioning one&#39;s self seem to always be there..?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue of deschooling caught my eye.  here is where I tripped up!  I did <br/>\nmuch of nothing quite often, but in between units or themes of study.  We <br/>\nstarted a foreign language, we have been do Key To math.  I didn&#39;t deschool <br/>\nas you say.  I went right to the books!  Would any of you say at this point <br/>\nthat I would have to take more time off and let the boys roam and explore and <br/>\nfind there own way?  The best time was had and the most interest has been in <br/>\nthings that we have done spontaneously without guide and planning.  It seems <br/>\nnatural to keep this up as it works best (I think they call this unschooling, <br/>\nhahahaha).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what is truthfully tripping me up about all of this... the very <br/>\nsmall time spent on any one thing?  I showed them how to identify trees, they <br/>\ndid it for 3 days, then on to something else.  this is OK?  because it is <br/>\nthis way with everything  ... well almost everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore silly questions from a mom in a state of inner-chaos!
