(and of course his bad handwriting..) we used it to our advantage.. got him tagged &quot;disgraphic&quot; as well as &quot;ADD&quot; thus invoking the magical 504 forms/designation.. so we can demand all kinds of things/alternate methods of assessment etc... it got him thru jr hi.. (luckily my other one will never have to experience jr hi at all...)<br/>\n<br/>\ngot sidetracked... <br/>\nthis criticism kept him from writing at all.. for a while.. and my younger son, 8, has been held back so much my the simple criticism of &quot;messy work&quot; .. it disgusts me to see &quot;teachers&quot; (and i use the term loosely.. especially in light of the teach/learning discussion) just stopping these kids in their tracks .. PREVENTING learning with these petty complaints..<br/>\n<br/>\n(oh, and have any of you ever had a public school teacher go on and on about how your child is just &quot;not doing a good job with his cutting and pasting&quot;? .. hahahaha.. i just can&#39;t get over that one.. <br/>\nOOOOOooooooo i&#39;m SO worried about cutting and pasting skills... i&#39;m sorry, it just sounds like  a joke to me.. altho they want to say it is THE indicator of hand eye coordination.. and this at five and six years old..... hahahhh... )<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda LL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Karin <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, July 08, 2002 1:45 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] For Ned was Teaching vs Learning<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; No, you don&#39;t correct spelling for your child, any more than we would<br/>\n  &gt; correct yours.
