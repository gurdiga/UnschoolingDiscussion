Remember, I had disconnected from this board <br/>\nfor about 3-4 months. Gosh, that was definitely too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in NYC most homeschoolers I know use curricula of one kind or <br/>\nanother. And some &#39;unschoolers&#39; have demarcated what they call <br/>\n&#39;learning&#39; from &#39;entertainment&#39; so play time, PCs and the TV are <br/>\nclosely regulated.
