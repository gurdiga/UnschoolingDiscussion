I have let my daughter and son<br/>\n&gt; stay up later because they wanted to several times, but the next day is<br/>\n&gt; usually a disaster.  They are 3 and 4 years old and don&#39;t seem to understand<br/>\n&gt; or care that when they stay up late at night it makes them feel terrible the<br/>\n&gt; next day.  I have decided to wait until they are little older for them to<br/>\n&gt; decide when to go to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughters (8 and 5) go to sleep whenever they want to and have almost<br/>\ntheir whole lives (there was a brief period of actual bedtime, agreed upon<br/>\nby all of us, when each of them went through a phase where being the last<br/>\none awake in a quiet house was frightening to them). These days, that&#39;s<br/>\nlater than either my husband or I are up (1 a.m. ish).<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither one of them is ever cranky or difficult in any way the next day.<br/>\nMost days, they simply sleep themselves out and get up at 10 or 11 or Noon.<br/>\nOn the days when we have to go someplace earlier, I let them know the night<br/>\nbefore. Sometimes, they then choose to lay down and try to sleep earlier,<br/>\nsometimes not. In either case, though it can be a bit difficult to wake<br/>\nthem, I just keep at it gently (stroking their hair, talking nicely) and<br/>\nthey wake up and remember what we&#39;re doing and cheerfully get up and get<br/>\nready to go. Then they sleep in the car. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54967,"nextTopicId":54927}}
