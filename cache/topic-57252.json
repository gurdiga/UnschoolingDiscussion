We know what &quot;sit&quot; means because we&#39;ve had a few million<br/>\nencounters with it in a huge range of contexts. But most of us probably only<br/>\nhave a *guess* what we think lowing might mean just because our encouters<br/>\nwith it are so few. We just don&#39;t have enough examples to have tested and<br/>\nrefined the definition on to feel confident that we know for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the words we know are somewhere on that spectrum from totally clear<br/>\nunderstanding to a fuzzy understanding that has worked for us so far. Our<br/>\ndefinitions work for the contexts we&#39;ve encountered. If we&#39;ve had a lot of<br/>\nencounters and don&#39;t come across any new contexts, our definitions won&#39;t<br/>\nrefine any further and we&#39;ll be pretty certain we know what a word means.<br/>\nLike sit. We&#39;re pretty sure we&#39;re not going to encounter a context that will<br/>\nturn our understanding on it&#39;s ear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd *that&#39;s* where people are when the come here. They *know* what respect<br/>\nis. They *know* what learning means. The definitions they have have always<br/>\nworked in the contexts they&#39;ve encountered.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here are new contexts. The contexts *will* help people build up a<br/>\nclearer understanding of the words they thought were already clear. But<br/>\npeople tend to read the new contexts using the old definitions because it<br/>\nisn&#39;t totally clear right off that the old definitions don&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nRefining definitions takes time and lots and lots of examples.

Knowing how to fix it is, of course, something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnalogies help. But it&#39;s helpful to be aware that we intend for the analogy<br/>\nto describe a piece of something larger. And the person trying to understand<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know which piece of the analogy is relevant to what piece of the new<br/>\nthing they&#39;re trying to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe husband and wife analogies are good examples.

I&#39;ve seen how people describe it<br/>\nevolve over that time. It&#39;s been slow but it is evolving.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason it&#39;s so slow is that the people giving advice don&#39;t get a<br/>\nlot of feedback on how their words are being interpretted. There&#39;s a number<br/>\nof reasons for that. Most people don&#39;t want to hold up what they&#39;re doing<br/>\nfor pubic examination. (We could fruitlessly discuss why they don&#39;t want to<br/>\ndo it here, but honestly it happens everywhere. People just don&#39;t like to<br/>\nfeel like fools in public.) They don&#39;t want others to realize they don&#39;t get<br/>\nit so they convince themselves that they do understand or that they will<br/>\nunderstand if they think about it or wait a while and read some more. Or<br/>\nthey *think* they understand. (That&#39;s probably the biggie.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionaly a really brave person -- just as you did -- will come back and<br/>\ntell us what they tried and what happened and that gives some feedback on<br/>\nhow the words are being interpretted and people can try to figure out how to<br/>\nexplain better.<br/>\n<br/>\nDescribing it *is* getting better. But it&#39;s far from being perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is that conscious parenting (and to some extent unschooling)<br/>\nif it were described to those who already understand, wouldn&#39;t sound much<br/>\ndifferent than what people using standard parenting practices do. Conscious<br/>\nparenting is basically recognizing that kids don&#39;t have the skills that<br/>\nadults do, so we help them live life. (Which would include, without saying<br/>\nit, helping them acquire the skills they need). It&#39;s not that much different<br/>\nthan an authoritarian, spanking parent might say. Or a school at homer. But<br/>\nobviously in practice it&#39;s poles apart!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf conscious parenting and unschooling were rule based, we could easily say<br/>\n&quot;Kids need help with this, this and this and you can drop helping them with<br/>\nthat, that and that.&quot; But it isn&#39;t rule based. It&#39;s based on the philosophy<br/>\nof listening to what you&#39;re kids are saying with their words and behavior<br/>\nand helping them get what they want out of life. And that&#39;s a really hard<br/>\nidea to convey accurately. Especially since most parents are certain they do<br/>\nthat already. And trying to get them to see how disrespectful standard<br/>\nparenting practices are without them feeling that they as people are<br/>\ndisrespectful is a challenging task. (&quot;What do you mean I&#39;m not respectful<br/>\nof my kids!?&quot;) It&#39;s as hard as getting across the concept to a child that<br/>\njust because I don&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like you.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a challenge to discuss the actions without the person thinking their<br/>\ncharacter is being discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really grateful to the people who *can* discuss their actions without<br/>\ntaking it personally. I&#39;d say it&#39;s one of the major things that makes the<br/>\nunschooling discussions most helpful to those just starting out. It&#39;s what<br/>\nhelps make the discussions more than a book of advice because people can see<br/>\nthe transitions in someone&#39;s thinking going on right in front of them. They<br/>\ncan see the wrong turns in thinking someone made and why those seemed like<br/>\nsensible turns based on their incomplete understanding. (Ren&#39;s journey, as I<br/>\nrecall, was particularly helpful :-) It&#39;s still there on the message boards<br/>\nat Unschooling.com)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another problem is that there are a number of changes in thinking people<br/>\nneed to make in order to understand. Most people can only focus on making<br/>\none change at a time. But if they only make one change, then the words mean<br/>\nsomething different than what the advice giver intends. An example is that<br/>\nif someone is working on giving up control, then &quot;no bedtimes&quot; will get<br/>\ntranslated into &quot;let the kids stay up as late as they want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI could tell Sandra in a conversation that I&#39;m helping Kathryn figure out<br/>\nmath and she&#39;d understand what I mean. But if I say that to someone who<br/>\nthinks kids need taught math, they won&#39;t interpret the words the same at<br/>\nall. They&#39;re going to translate it as I sit her down and teach her math.<br/>\nThey&#39;re going to try to put what I say into a context they already<br/>\nunderstand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that translating of words into already understood contexts is the<br/>\nessence of the problem. No one has the unschooling/conscious parenting<br/>\ncontexts to translate the words into. We have to help them create new<br/>\ncontexts so the words mean what we intend them to mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a really good book about the process of thinking. It&#39;s called The<br/>\nSociety of Mind (by Marvin Minsky I think). It&#39;s about how we build up these<br/>\nlittle piece of understanding to understand larger things. I think one of<br/>\nthe examples he used was how we figure out how a fast food restaurant<br/>\noperates if we&#39;ve had experience with sit down restaurants and other things.<br/>\nIt&#39;s built up of mostly of things that we already understand that had just<br/>\nnever been put together like that. Or that are the same in essence but<br/>\nslightly different in practice. And some totally new things. Like paying for<br/>\nthings at the cash register, and seeing the connection between ordering off<br/>\na menu on a wall and ordering off a menu in our hands. That wasn&#39;t his<br/>\nexample exactly, but there was something similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to provide for people. We&#39;re trying to<br/>\ndeconstruct what they understand and build a new model from totally<br/>\ndifferent pieces. People already possess most of the pieces but they hadn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen used that way before. But during the process of building a new model,<br/>\npeople will insist on using the old models and trying to understand from the<br/>\nold models. For example, most people can&#39;t help translating unschooling into<br/>\nneglect because that&#39;s the model they already have that most closely<br/>\nresembles what they&#39;re hearing described.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do you describe something that needs a point of view shift to<br/>\nunderstand? Most people start with trying to help someone shift their point<br/>\nof view. *That&#39;s* the transition that most people are trying to help others<br/>\nmake. They&#39;re trying to help them understand what the principles are and why<br/>\nthey work so that someone can make their own decisions.

Isn&#39;t that how they&#39;ve learned EVERYTHING else?

Really, why would I trade our wonderful dreams for arithmetic?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched a movie tonight about a Middle School Dance Team and what they did to realize their dreams and the dance teacher&#39;s regret in giving up on herself too soon.

I have seen ( myself included) folks frustrated, confused, and <br/>\nbasically &quot;ignorant&quot; of how to proceed.  I have also seen ( myself included) <br/>\nmuch much progress and and attitude changing and pov alterations.   The <br/>\nadvice that unschoolers give does not include these intermediate steps.  Its <br/>\njust says DO THIS or DONT DO THAT.  I posted something about this vague <br/>\nadvice on HEM-unschooling..  ( going to find it.. ...<br/>\n<br/>\nOK.. I found it. I will cut and paste it here.. sorry folks who have already <br/>\nread it..)<br/>\n<br/>\n___<br/>\nI understand exactly what you are asking, and I am still struggling with <br/>\nunderstanding the concept as well. I dont know your situation, but for me, <br/>\nhomeschooling is brand new. The ideals of unschooling are very VERY <br/>\n&quot;foriegn&quot; to me ( PLEASE God dont let anyone rip me apart for my <br/>\nadmission..) I am very eager to learn all I can, but I think that its much <br/>\nmore difficult for families to &quot;convert&quot; to a completely new way of thinking, <br/>\n<br/>\nparenting and relating to each other. For families that have always <br/>\nsubscribed to attachement parenting and unschooling, there is ( was) no <br/>\ntransition period. It wasn&#39;t something they had to learn, it has always been <br/>\nthier way of life. Sometimes I get the feeling like .. OK.. lets say I have <br/>\nnever driven a car. I WANT to drive a car. I think cars are great.. I am <br/>\nready to learn how to drive a car and I want to drive it well. A person who <br/>\nhas been driving since they were 14 hands me keys and a car manual and says.. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK.. get in, turn it on, and start driving. I would of course ask <br/>\nquestions, I would be unclear on every aspect of operating a car and <br/>\ndriving. When I asked questions or made comments, the veteran driver would <br/>\nact all irriated, insult me, be sarcastic, basically treat me like an idiot <br/>\nbecause I dont know how to drive a car. If I asked , how do I parallel <br/>\npark? They might reply, park alongside the road where the lines indicate. <br/>\n??!?!?!?!?!? That tells me nothing. Questions that &quot;new&quot; unschoolers have , <br/>\nespecially, &quot;converts&quot;.. often don&#39;t apply to veteran unschoolers and they <br/>\nmay answer them with answers like. &quot;that never happens to me&quot; Or, &quot;I dont <br/>\nsee that as a problem in my family&quot; Or, &quot; Ive never done it any other way&quot; <br/>\nIt has to be difficult to respond to questions and situations that one has <br/>\nnever dealt with.. BUT, I think sometimes we all have to use a little empathy <br/>\n<br/>\nand try to see the other parties point of view. <br/>\n___________<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.. someone else asked a while back about the &quot;framework&quot; that we need <br/>\nto replace the old stuff with.  That framework takes a long time, and a lot <br/>\nof learning and understanding to get in place.    I really think that the <br/>\nfrustrations that newbies have come from the IN YOUR FACE attitudes that they <br/>\nencounter when they first &quot;confess thier sins&quot; of  not radically unschooling. <br/>\n  Its like folks say.. STOP DOING THAT!  ITS WRONG.. YOUR DAMAGING YOUR KID.. <br/>\nlots of times this advice is offered in a condescending or annoyed tone.   <br/>\nSo, what do we do.. OMG... we better STOP.. CHANGE .. DO IT THIS WAY.... Then <br/>\nwe encounter problems because the framework wasnt in place.. We DID take <br/>\ngiant steps and not baby steps because that is the attitude with which the <br/>\nadvice was given.  Its even been said, folks arent here to babyify newbies.  <br/>\nThey are not here to  support us.  They are not here to sugar coat things and <br/>\nspoon feed us.  They are here to give us the low down, nothing but the truth, <br/>\ntake this pill and swallow it REAL advice on  REAL unschooling.   And, hey, <br/>\nthats fine..  Ive said before, I dont need to be coddled.  But when the hard <br/>\nhitting advice doesnt just BAMO-PRESTO work like a charm,  its not fair for <br/>\nthe &quot;veterans&quot; to THEN tell us. OH. sorry, we left out the transitioning <br/>\nstuff.. the framework, the small steps...  Herein lies the failures and <br/>\nfrustrations of the struggling new unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@bravewriter.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Holly&#39;s advice to those new to kid-freedoms","postDate":"1043965745","msgId":57255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIxYzh2aCs0aDFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3Yi4xNTRiMDY1Mi4yYjZhZmU2OEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57252,"nextInTopic":57274,"prevInTime":57254,"nextInTime":57256,"topicId":57252,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... parents ... might say Come ... they might ...
