We don&#39;t have a lot of money so we won<br/>\nt have tons of that kind of thing laying around. We don&#39;t even schedule our<br/>\nlearning. I take it as it comes, whenever an opportunity presents itself.<br/>\nSometimes just driving around I&#39;ll see something and ask her if she&#39;d like<br/>\nto play a &quot;game&quot; using it. Our learning happens at all hours of the day<br/>\nwherever we are and I try not to plan it because it seems to dim the shine<br/>\non learning. You know what I mean? We use whatever is available and alot of<br/>\nit is this computer. So glad for the internet, inexpensive and you can find<br/>\ninformation on EVERYTHING on it. LOL\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI do keep a lose notebook of the things we&#39;ve covered along with a level of<br/>\nhow much we&#39;ve went into. If we just covered the surface or done an in-depth<br/>\nresearch thing. I don&#39;t I could school using a curriculum LOL It bores me!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAngi\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Saturday, June 01, 2002 12:26:04 PM\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: unschooling in Texas\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHi Angi,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe are in Texas as well.
