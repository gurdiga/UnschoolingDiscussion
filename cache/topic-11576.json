For this you&#39;ll need a<br/>\n&gt; bargaining chip (in our house it&#39;s Nintendo).  3 strikes means no &#39;tendo for<br/>\n&gt; the remainder of the day and all of the next.  If there is a fuss about it,<br/>\n&gt; the time is extended.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The way I use it there are actually 9 opportunities to mess up before the<br/>\n&gt; priveledge is taken away.  That way I can give plenty of warning and not have<br/>\n&gt; to get nasty about it.  3 warnings = 1 strike.  The warnings are all in the<br/>\n&gt; same day for the same type of offense that leads tp strikes  but do not have<br/>\n&gt; to happen at the same time.  The strikes do not have to be for the same<br/>\n&gt; offense.  (one strike could be for chore refusal, another for hitting brother<br/>\n&gt; (no warnings given for hitting offenses in my house:  hitting = immediate<br/>\n&gt; strike!), another for shouting at me, etc.)  Depending on the situation, all<br/>\n&gt; strikes may be for the same offense, especially if there are several things<br/>\n&gt; you are working on and you want to concentrate on one at a time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For instance, if the offense is shouting at mom; when kidlet shouts he is<br/>\n&gt; told &#39;the rule is no shouting in our household, that is your first warning&#39;.<br/>\n&gt; If he stops shouting, the problem is dealt with and we move on with our day.<br/>\n&gt; If he shouts again, it&#39;s warning two and on to strike one.  Then repeat for<br/>\n&gt; strikes 2 and 3 as needed.  I guarantee that within 24-48 hours of setting up<br/>\n&gt; the system you&#39;ll be tested and kidlet will have 3 strikes.  So pick<br/>\n&gt; something that means something to him/her and something you can live with<br/>\n&gt; enforcing.  The first time is the hardest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then mark it on the calendar...no &lt;fill in the blank&gt;...tell the child while<br/>\n&gt; you are marking the calendar (or posting a note) what the offense was and<br/>\n&gt; remind how long the consequence lasts.  (this step is essential for me,<br/>\n&gt; otherwise I forget he&#39;s grounded!)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This really works!  When my kids were 12 and 2 I started this system.  It<br/>\n&gt; worked so well that when someone asks what to do, I go through a long process<br/>\n&gt; of thought and examples before I remember what we do...in other words I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t had to impose strikes for so long I forget we do it!  I&#39;ll tell you<br/>\n&gt; what, though, the kid remembers!  Now when he misbehaves we skip the warnings<br/>\n&gt; and he gets a strike at the first offense (because he&#39;s already been<br/>\n&gt; repeating it long enough I had to go through the whole brain wracking thing<br/>\n&gt; to remember what to do!).  That is usually all it takes.  (youngest is almost<br/>\n&gt; 12 now)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My oldest used it to brag what a mean mom he had.  Oldest DS is a very<br/>\n&gt; stubborn person (I tell myself it will serve him well some day!  LOL).  One<br/>\n&gt; particular day he was very intent on being as ornery as possible.  He was<br/>\n&gt; yelling at me, refusing to do the chore he was assigned, slamming doors, etc.<br/>\n&gt;  I have never seen a child being so rude to his parents as he was that<br/>\n&gt; evening!  So, I told him what was expected (so proud of myself for not<br/>\n&gt; raising my voice or beating the kid!), gave him the warnings, then strikes.<br/>\n&gt; He still continued.  So, we went through a round of strikes (without further<br/>\n&gt; warnings) for another day with no &#39;tendo, then a third.  Then he was told he<br/>\n&gt; had 5 minutes to calm down.  If he wasn&#39;t able to speak calmly and deal with<br/>\n&gt; the chore by then, he&#39;d lose a day of &#39;tendo for every additional minute it<br/>\n&gt; took him to get control of himself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He was grounded for 6 weeks!!  Apparently it got his attention, though.  When<br/>\n&gt; the kids had their<br/>\n&gt; you-think-your-mom&#39;s-so-bad-just-be-glad-you-don&#39;t-have-mine contests, he won<br/>\n&gt; everytime.  He never got that mouthy again.  He&#39;s still stubborn, but he<br/>\n&gt; learned to state his opinion in a much nicer tone and with much better<br/>\n&gt; language and that he still had to take out the trash when it was his<br/>\n&gt; assignment.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your method is similar to the one in  &quot; 1, 2, 3 Magic &quot;.

He&#39;s still stubborn, but he <br/>\nlearned to state his opinion in a much nicer tone and with much better <br/>\nlanguage and that he still had to take out the trash when it was his <br/>\nassignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother tool is a required essay (assuming child is old enough to write or <br/>\ndictate).  For this one I would tell him I wanted a one page (2, 3, 500 word, <br/>\nwhatever you pick) essay on something like &#39;the importance of treating each <br/>\nfamily member with respect&#39;.  A rule, stated in a positive way.  You can be a <br/>\nspecific or as general as you like.  The &#39;why&#39; part seemed to be important, <br/>\nthough.  I guess because it gave him something to &#39;hang&#39; the essay on.  Then <br/>\nhe had to come up with sentence, paragraph and essay structure explaining the <br/>\nsubject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe had me in stitches the day he decided to write a very well written essay <br/>\nabout not yelling at mom.  His points were something like:  yelling makes mom <br/>\nmade, mom is not pleasant to be around when she&#39;s mad, it isn&#39;t a good idea <br/>\nto make mom mad.  Very cheeky!  After laughing out loud while I read it and <br/>\ncongratulating him on his creativity, I told him to re-write the essay <br/>\nproperly!  Scamp.  (I kept that essay.  The rest we threw away.  The problem <br/>\nwas dealt with, so the essay also went out with the trash.  I suppose it <br/>\ncould be interesting to put into portfolios if you need essays for <br/>\nassessments!  heheheh)<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, he was sure this essay would get my goat.  Took away all his <br/>\nsting when I laughed and pointed out what excellent sentence structure he had <br/>\nused.  Plus, seeing the humor kept it from being personal enough to hurt my <br/>\nfeelings.  He still had to re-write it, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried the old practice of writing sentences over and over again...it <br/>\ndid not have nearly the impact essay writing did.  But when we did resort to <br/>\nsentences they were wordy ones with new vocabulary words.  I figured at least <br/>\nthen he&#39;d have to think about it a little bit while he was copying it down!  <br/>\nThis might work better for younger writers than essay writing.  We progressed <br/>\nfrom sentences to essays.  I got tired of thinking up sentences that weren&#39;t <br/>\nrepetitive and figured it was time for him to do the thinking.  After all, he <br/>\nwas the one that misbehaved.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11587,"nextTopicId":11596}}
