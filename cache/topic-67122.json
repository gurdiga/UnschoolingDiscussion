The kids don&#39;t have to clean up their room,<br/>\nalthough I personally won&#39;t walk in there if I can&#39;t get across the floor<br/>\nwithout stepping on something. So they clean enough to at least leave a path<br/>\nto their beds, LOL. But I would draw the line at clothes or towels or books<br/>\ngetting ruined in there. Sometimes if it makes me crazy enough, I&#39;ll go in<br/>\nand help them clean and re-organize stuff. I bought them bins to keep stuff<br/>\norganized, ha ha. If they are constantly missing toys and asking me to come<br/>\nhelp them find them, I&#39;ll remind them that the purpose of the bins was to<br/>\nhelp them not lose things. Like if the little horses go back into their bin<br/>\nat the end of the day, my daughter won&#39;t have to run around the whole house<br/>\nin a panic trying to find the one she wants to play with. My son is starting<br/>\nto get this. He&#39;s lost the parts to some of his Bionicles despite having a<br/>\nbin with a lid to keep them in. So he&#39;s paying a lot more attention to that<br/>\nnow as he likes to be able to rebuild them sometimes after using the pieces<br/>\nin something else. He keeps all the instruction sheets in one place now too!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when we have friends over to play, before they go we usually ask<br/>\neveryone to do a &quot;Five minute Room Rescue&quot; (thank you Flylady!). Like<br/>\nyesterday, the kids had the living room completely covered in stuff, you<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t see an inch of floor! so they all pitched in and cleaned up that<br/>\none room before they left. I love a lot of Flylady&#39;s techniques, like the<br/>\nroom rescue. They work well for kids too because they know it&#39;s only for a<br/>\nfew minutes, we set the timer and it&#39;s like a race to see what we can get<br/>\ndone. If we all pitch in, then a room can be pretty reasonable in five<br/>\nminutes or less. We also do the &quot;28 fling boogie&quot; and the kids like that<br/>\none. It&#39;s almost like a treasure hunt to see if we can find 28 things that<br/>\nneed throwing away.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: WWUD","postDate":"1051800784","msgId":67145,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDljLjMwYmZiNmQ2LjJiZTI4ZWQwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67139,"nextInTopic":67149,"prevInTime":67144,"nextInTime":67146,"topicId":67122,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/1/03 10:44:44 AM Eastern Daylight Time, mina@mabb.net ...

You heard horror stories about accidents without <br/>\nthem? I have a &quot;near-horror story&quot; about an accident wherein a helmet <br/>\nsaved my 10 yo boy&#39;s life. If he had not had a helmet on his head <br/>\nwhen he went off the road and out of control down a trackless <br/>\nhillside, when he impacted the tree, we could have been making <br/>\ndecisions about organ donation, instead of taking him to Immediate <br/>\nCare and having him bandaged and x-rayed. I INSIST on them, though no <br/>\none else out here in our rural area has them. But...no one out here <br/>\nwears seatbelts either. we do. This is one hill I am more than <br/>\nwilling to battle over.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) cleaning their rooms. We have family chores, and one of the kids&#39; <br/>\ndaily chores is make your beds, pick up dirty clothes from the floor, <br/>\ntoss accumulated trash in your room. So, I can&#39;t say they&#39;ve ever <br/>\ngotten really bad, though there&#39;s always a bit of clutter. When <br/>\nKatie&#39;s room gets really bad (Robby&#39;s never does) I go in and sit on <br/>\nthe bed and say &quot;that goes there&quot; &quot;put that in the garbage&quot; &quot;put that <br/>\nin the dirty clothes pile by the door&quot; etc. She&#39;s getting to where <br/>\nshe knows a bit about organizing &quot;a clean up&quot; and she doesn&#39;t balk <br/>\neven a littel bit about doing it, if I&#39;m in there with her. It&#39;s when <br/>\nI say &quot;Go clean your room!&quot; and not go in to talk to her, that she <br/>\nputs up a fuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we ever take the step of not making them clean their rooms as a <br/>\ndaily thing, and their rooms get trashed :&#92; I would say &quot;Keep it how <br/>\nyou want it, but don&#39;t take anything that belongs to me or other <br/>\nfamily members, (book) or that belongs to the household (towel) in <br/>\nthere.&quot; If she likes her room messy, that&#39;s okay, but when her messy <br/>\ninfringes on other people&#39;s property, in our home, it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nokay. Oh, laundry. Does your daughter manage to get her dirty clothes <br/>\nto the laundry room? That&#39;d be another thing: keep your room how you <br/>\nwant, but I&#39;m not going in, so if you want clean clothes, get them to <br/>\nthe laundry room or let me know you&#39;re doing a load and I&#39;ll get my <br/>\nlaundry out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) second-guessing!

I see so many <br/>\nnon-homeschooling parents with such opposite views on some things, and they <br/>\nall see loving and caring and level-headed, but so wrong compared to the <br/>\nexperience I have here. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey were discussing whether children should be forced to go to a disliked <br/>\ngrandmother&#39;s funeral, just to show respect and honor their dad. I said it <br/>\nshould be their choice. They were talking about bicycle helmets and whether <br/>\nthey should be enforced. I don&#39;t enforce them, but now i wonder if I should. <br/>\nI think it&#39;s foolish to ride a motorcycle without one, so why shouldn&#39;t I <br/>\ninsist my children wear one. There were of course personal tales of biking <br/>\ntragedies of helmetless riders. It got me thinking, I make my children wear <br/>\nseatbelts for their safety, or ride in carseats, so what is different about <br/>\nhelmets and what would unschoolers do? <br/>\n<br/>\nWWUD? LOL <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought we had talked about helmets here before, and why some here don&#39;t <br/>\nenforce them. But do they enforce seatbelts and carseats? Where do you draw <br/>\nthe line?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest WWUD issue is about my daughter cleaning her room. I am *really* <br/>\ntrying to let it go. I *hate* when she leaves her room trashed for a long <br/>\ntime, and have tried saying if you want to do this, your room better be <br/>\nclean. Instead of just making her go in and do it. At one point she lied <br/>\nabout her room being clean when asked(a red flag, which made me consider <br/>\nwhether it wasn&#39;t another form of my asserting my needs on her and <br/>\nthreatening her for my own comfort) because she wanted to do something else <br/>\ninstead. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told her that from now on, I won&#39;t nag her at all. I had stopped nagging <br/>\na bit, without telling her why, and she would take care of it more on her <br/>\nown, but if it got to a certain point the battle would begin. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis time I told her I am not going to engage in it anymore. So of course she <br/>\nlet her room get totally trashed. I started getting impatient waiting for her <br/>\nto take responsibility. I told her to keep the door shut, and she is so <br/>\nforgetful, she doesn&#39;t. The younger brother and sister get in there, and i <br/>\nhave to go and retrieve bath towels before they get ruined with mildew, and <br/>\none of my antique-ish books got ruined, and I got upset and went back on my <br/>\nword. I bitched her out and demanded she clean it. Over a book and towels <br/>\nthat really shouldn&#39;t matter. UGH! <br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad stepped in (to referee between our two bullheaded personalities) and <br/>\nthreatened to spank her if it wasn&#39;t done by a certain time.....oh no......we <br/>\nhad said no more spanking a few weeks ago.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say anything, I should have. I wasn&#39;t going to let him spank her, <br/>\nbut I shouldn&#39;t even let that threat weigh on her. I think I have a bruise <br/>\nfrom smacking my forehead. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo again, if you have even read this ridiculously long post, I am looking for <br/>\nWWUD concerning keeping kids bedrooms clean. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am really dumb, because she was telling me(before the blowup) how great it <br/>\nwas that it was her room, and she didn&#39;t like the pressure of keeping it <br/>\nspotless, and she liked it a little messy. And that she loved it being her <br/>\nchoice and responsibility. I didn&#39;t want spotless, I can live a bit of mess. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis got way out of control, and I reacted. I didn&#39;t trust. I didn&#39;t let her <br/>\nde-roomclean long enough. I know she eventually would have cleaned it up <br/>\nherself. She did, but only after her dad threatened. And she did a great job, <br/>\nand was proud, so the end result was seemingly good. At what cost? I have let <br/>\nwhole days go while she moped in her room, waiting for her to just do it. <br/>\nWhat a waste, I know that doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should offer to help? A lot of times in the past she would just cry <br/>\nand say she can&#39;t, and she needed help. She is used to me saying no. And I <br/>\nhave helped before, but then i take over and organize things to my liking, <br/>\nand she doesn&#39;t want that either. <br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle ground, oh middle ground, where are you middle ground?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to be dependant on the opinions of unschoolers for every <br/>\nparenting concern, but some insight would be appreciated, until I can start <br/>\ndoing things that work like I was born with the knowledge, without  second <br/>\nguessing and re-living past mistakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67518,"nextTopicId":67658}}
