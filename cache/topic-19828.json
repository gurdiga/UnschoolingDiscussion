I&#39;m with you Vic, there<br/>\nis an herbal remedy for just about everything, but in<br/>\nour chemically driven society it is sometimes hard to<br/>\nfind the right ones.  I am taking colloidal Silver,<br/>\nthe rememdy I mentioned yesterday, for this throat<br/>\ninfection.  I began taking it late yesterday morning,<br/>\nand I am feeling worlds better.  Not feverish and<br/>\nachey anymore, and the swelling in my throat has gone<br/>\nway down, as has the pain.  My throat still hurts<br/>\nsome, but it is more tollerable now, like a bad sore<br/>\nthroat, and I am able to control it with extra<br/>\nstrength tylenol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to get up this morning at 3:30, after having<br/>\nslept a good portion of yesterday and all night last<br/>\nnight I was all slept out!  After bothering my hubby<br/>\nfor as long as I felt I resonably could (grin), I got<br/>\nup and started some homemade soup in the crock pot. <br/>\nPlenty of onions and whole garlic cloves.  That should<br/>\nfix me up!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to everyone for your good wishes.  I am sure<br/>\nthey played a part too!<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
