My son (8) and I were sitting across from <br/>\neach other in a restaurant the other day and he made the observation <br/>\nthat his glass was to his right and my glass was to my left.  This <br/>\nwas not particularly notable, except for the fact that my son did <br/>\nnot know his left from his right just a month ago, let alone that <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s left and right would be in reverse when sitting opposite <br/>\nof him.  Not only that, but he had many therapy sessions from age 6 <br/>\nto 7 where the therapist would patiently drill him with exercises <br/>\nfor him to somehow gain this `important&#39; skill (I never did <br/>\nunderstand exactly how this was supposed to help him).  Of course, I <br/>\nnow regret allowing this to go on when my heart said, `something is <br/>\nnot right in Denmark.&#39;   Ah, water under the bridge now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just too curious how he acquired this seemingly elusive skill, <br/>\nso I asked him about it.  He said, &quot;I guess I just needed to know it <br/>\nfor something.&quot;  He wasn&#39;t able to elaborate any further, but <br/>\nsuffice it to say, he believed he learned it because he NEEDED it.  <br/>\nAs far as I&#39;m concerned, case closed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238219316,"authorName":"Brandie","from":"Brandie &lt;tableforfive@...&gt;","profile":"scrapdiva73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Article: How Babies Learn Their First Words","postDate":"1143043629","msgId":112948,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgzMDM4MTFlMDYwMzIyMDgwN3cxNjA1NjNlM3diOTBkZTYyYTdhZjc5M2Q4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":112953,"prevInTime":112947,"nextInTime":112949,"topicId":112948,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cool article : How Babies Learn Their First Words http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20060322/sc_space/howbabieslearntheirfirstwords -- Brandie ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1258042057\">Cool article :<br/>\n<br/>\nHow Babies Learn Their First Words<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20060322/sc_space/howbabieslearntheirfirstwords\">http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20060322/sc_space/howbabieslearntheirfirstwords</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrandie<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tableforfive.blogspot.com\">http://tableforfive.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scrapgirls.com/store/manufacturer.php?id=15\">http://www.scrapgirls.com/store/manufacturer.php?id=15</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe work of art which I do not make, none other will ever make.  --Simone<br/>\nWeil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112887,"nextTopicId":112946}}
