I was thinking about making a chore wheel for each child to spin but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to be much fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, if you have any ideas for cleaning games can you please share them with me?<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal McNerney<br/>\nHomeschooling On A Budget<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\n<br/>\nExchange time & money saving tips, low cost educational ideas, activities & resources<br/>\nwith homeschooling families interested in providing a quality education for less.<br/>\nSubscribe today! <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HS-For-Less-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">HS-For-Less-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nLearn more about us at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HS-For-Less\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HS-For-Less</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22760,"nextTopicId":22775}}
