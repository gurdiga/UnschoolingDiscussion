They will learn what they need for<br/>\nthemselves. Parents are there to facilitate.<br/>\n<br/>\n(That&#39;s oversimplified of course. Parental attitude towards life and<br/>\nlearning is a big part of unschooling. We can&#39;t expect kids to get excited<br/>\nabout learning if we never are. We can&#39;t expect kids to follow interests<br/>\nthat have never run through their lives in an interesting way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEclectic homeschooling is parents having an idea where the children need to<br/>\ngo and then letting the children have a big say in what method of travel<br/>\nthey use to get there. Science might be videos or experiments or classes or<br/>\nwhatever appeals to the child. There will be a focus on specific subjects<br/>\nand skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29255176,"authorName":"ECHSA","from":"&quot;ECHSA&quot; &lt;echsa@...&gt;","profile":"cathykoetsier","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling by definition","postDate":"1013196428","msgId":31965,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZTAwMWMxYjE2NSRkYTMxZTIwMCQ3NmNlMDdjNEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PEI4N0Q2MEZGLjRBODklZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31969,"prevInTime":31964,"nextInTime":31966,"topicId":31965,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Me again I think I understand, but to make sure, would someone please briefly clarify the difference between so-called  eclectic homeschooling and ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1786154622\">Me again<br/>\nI think I understand, but to make sure, would someone please briefly clarify<br/>\nthe difference between so-called  &#39;eclectic homeschooling&#39; and<br/>\nunschooling...<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31694,"nextTopicId":31963}}
