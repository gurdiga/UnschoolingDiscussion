Another good one is The Shepherd&#39;s Dog by (I think) John Holman.<br/>\n<br/>\n10 acres is really a more ideal size for training sheepdogs, but you can get by on just a few acres.  If you&#39;re looking to make a bit of a living out of it, you first need to get really good at training your own dogs (so years of lessons, clinics, trialing, etc), and most of that you can do on a smaller property.  But at some point you&#39;re going to feel the need to expand to a larger area -- you can do that by leasing a field from a neighbor tho.  Also, you need some breathing room if you&#39;re going to keep enough sheep to train a number of dogs (but again, can lease pasture space if need be).  We definitely feel cramped here, will be relocating in the next several years to a more ideal set up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that answers the question now that I understood it!
