My <br/>\ndaughter wants to learn Spanish. She asked for something more in depth than <br/>\nwatching &quot;Standard Deviant&quot; or &quot;MUZZY&quot; videos. Having heard about the <br/>\nPowerglide program, I wanted to get feedback. Of course exposure to native <br/>\nspeakers would be wonderful, if one has that option. I received great <br/>\nfeedback about Spanish language channels, internet sites, and other avenues <br/>\nfor learning. I also found out that Powerglide can be a wonderful option for <br/>\nsomeone motivated to learn the language. This would not be a forced <br/>\ncurriculum. GAG! This is seeking recommendations from veteran unschoolers <br/>\nabout how their children have gone about learning a foreign language when <br/>\nthey were interested.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume though that those of us asking about such programs are not also <br/>\ninterested in the more heated discussions concerning unschooling.

They all go together to help me provide an unschooling <br/>\nenvironment for my family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree. The parents need to unschool before they can unschool their <br/>\nchildren. All the way through graduate school, most of what I learned was on <br/>\nmy own. I can&#39;t say that it took long for me to discard the boxed curriculum <br/>\nafter I rescued my children from the horrors of public school (Ned, the <br/>\nbathroom incident that you described brought back painful memories of what my <br/>\nson endured). My children said it best, &quot;If we&#39;re going to do this, then send <br/>\nus back to school. At least there we have some other kids to play with.&quot; I <br/>\nknew that they were right. I just had to trust them to learn what they needed <br/>\nor wanted.

For those who don&#39;t know, Luz and I have been given<br/>\npermission to post several articles  on a website: the name/page is as<br/>\nfillows:<br/>\nwww.borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anecdotes about our unschooling/raising our kid, I thought I&#39;d save<br/>\nspace here by not including that. As some of you have noticed, I am a<br/>\ncandidate for the support group called &quot;On-anon-anon&quot; even without bragging<br/>\nabout our son and my children by my four previous wives. OOOOOooooooo<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people like some of the things I write, and some don&#39;t. It&#39;s hard to<br/>\ntell what to write. Unschooling, for Luz and me, was ANYTHING BUT SCHOOLING<br/>\nunless the kid begs for it, so I reckoned that this group is sophisticated<br/>\nand could handle some topics that relate to our homeschooling rights. But<br/>\nno, that is not to some people&#39;s liking because that would mean talking<br/>\nabout the  politics or economics behind those rights.<br/>\n<br/>\n Should I repeat myself by posting the same articles here?  No.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s not much to unschooling, really. Until a kid is about seven, it&#39;s<br/>\nparenting, anyway, it&#39;s not even un-anything. Parenting is a huge<br/>\nresponsibility. Of course, we are constantly teaching our kids even when<br/>\nwe&#39;re trying not to. All those ideas get kicked around, all the prejudices,<br/>\nopinions, all that information from living to adulthood. We even pass along<br/>\nour conviction that we got from going to school...that we&#39;re not good<br/>\nlearners. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we get our kid to, say age 7, without turning him/her into a school-type<br/>\nidiot (intellectual dependent) day-care zombie, we can say we&#39;ve been<br/>\nunschooling all along, and we see that our kid has already learned a great<br/>\ndeal, and we have no idea how s/he did it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick at that time is to try to continue the same exact approach, and<br/>\nthe only thing that changes might be the actual activities you do. It&#39;s<br/>\nalways a good practice for parents to be deeply interested in things of<br/>\ntheir own instead of being interested in making sure that the kids are<br/>\n&quot;interested in&quot; stuff. Let the kids find their own stuff so they&#39;ll come and<br/>\ntell you about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRich people have always been interested in seeing that their children<br/>\nlearned several skills of survival. That&#39;s what animals teach their kids,<br/>\ntoo, so it just might make some sense in an evolutionary sense. The rich are<br/>\nout sailing boats, or riding horses -- those take critical skills and an<br/>\nurgency and self-dependency that people need when their taxes are due for an<br/>\naudit, or when a young person applies for a job. Life is challenges. Kids<br/>\nneed to be prepared. It&#39;s what school can&#39;t do, because sitting in those<br/>\nrows and being told about life by someone who has never lived (really) is an<br/>\nartificial, second-hand, worthless waste of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nShooting is a big deal now. There&#39;s hardly a stronger sense of urgency than<br/>\npulling a trigger and feeling the jolt of a bullet being kicked out by the<br/>\nexplosion and seeing what that bullet does to a wooden crate. If it is a<br/>\nshotgun, all the more sensational and a giddy sense of accomplishment.<br/>\nDon&#39;t like guns, archery teaches all sorts of important things. Kids need to<br/>\nsee something when they&#39;re done, so crafts are great. Anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I taught school (just 3 yrs, mercifully) I believed that the most<br/>\nimportant thing was art. All 3 years, I had my classes (2nd grade, 3rd, 5+6<br/>\ntogether) write books and illustrate it themselves, too. It took about two<br/>\nmonths, maybe three. First, tell a story. Next write an outline and that<br/>\nwould be a list of chapter titles, so that each part of the outline would be<br/>\na short story inside the big one. Then, write a chapter every week. If you<br/>\ncan tell it, but can&#39;t write fast, I&#39;ll write it down as you tell it, and<br/>\nthen you copy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo each week, every kid wrote a chapter, printed it out in various ways, and<br/>\nmade an illustration with paint or collage or pastels -- no crayons, no<br/>\nmarkers -- too slap-dash most of the time...not sensual.  In Florida, the<br/>\n5-6 grade books were placed on the big tables in the children&#39;s section of<br/>\nthe public library for all the town&#39;s children to read them. They were there<br/>\nfor several weeks and were well taken care of by the children. They loved<br/>\nthem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor homeschooling, it just might be the parent who needs to write the book<br/>\nand let the kid see that you like writing your book, and illustrating it and<br/>\nprinting it and binding it with a beautiful cover, and putting it in a<br/>\nspecial place. Kids like to be proud of what their parents do, even if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t show it. They brag to their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of friends, they only need one. If they get more, and they want<br/>\nthem, fine, but they do need one. That is urgent business for a parent, in<br/>\ncase your child is lonely. Take your kid to places where there are kids --<br/>\ncraft centers, kid museums, playgrounds...until s/he finds a good friend,<br/>\nsomeone to relate to in ways that are impossible for adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re doing a decent job of parenting, the kid comes into contact with a<br/>\nvariety of things, and is curious about some of them. If s/he trusts you<br/>\nwith his/her thoughts and doesn&#39;t expect a &quot;teaching moment&quot; from you every<br/>\ntime s/he asks you something, than maybe you&#39;ll discover what makes his/her<br/>\nboat float, and you can actually do something to help out.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not about getting &#39;teaching&quot; ideas from other people. That&#39;s<br/>\nschool. Parents who are at a loss about how to unschool their kid and<br/>\nbelieve that if they aren&#39;t unschooling them, the kid is &quot;wasting time.&quot;<br/>\nSuch a parent needs to discover his/her own interests and follow those, and<br/>\nnot try to get the kids to &quot;do stuff that&#39;s educational.&quot; Unschooling has<br/>\nnothing at all to do with schooling. It has to do with living. The two are<br/>\nnot the same. Schooling has nothing to do with learning, either. If there&#39;s<br/>\nany connection, it&#39;s coincidental.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat schools teach has never had anything to do with what kids are<br/>\ninterested in. There&#39;s another one of those crazy absolutes for which some<br/>\nof you will give exceptions. Fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids mostly need to go out an play -- all the time. Let them invent their<br/>\nown games, dig a hole, climb a tree -- all indispensible activities. The<br/>\nmore the better. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the Powerglide/HOP/&quot;teacher store&quot; discussion folks might do better,<br/>\nand might be with more compatible/friendly people, if they went to a more<br/>\nwussy list where such things are the usual fare -- the school-at-home crowd<br/>\ninstead of squirming in your chairs when somebody says &quot;school budget&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;libertarian&quot; or &quot;Unalienable Rights.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd excuse me, but where is it carved that we need a thorough discussion,<br/>\nor five, about whether or not there&#39;s a hell.

If ever there<br/>\nwere topics that don&#39;t teach anything, I would say those are prime examples.<br/>\nMaybe those are candidates for &quot;moving to another list,&quot; as has been told to<br/>\nme, making room for &quot;unschooling&quot; posts, whatever those are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelah. <br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40792,"nextTopicId":40490}}
