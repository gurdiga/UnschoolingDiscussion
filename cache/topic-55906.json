It&#39;s<br/>\ncommunity &quot;wisdom&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpanking is a cultural practice in America too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut fundamentalists spank because it&#39;s a mandate from God. It overrides<br/>\nfamily and community and personal practices because it&#39;s what God<br/>\n(supposedly) wants them to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried Sandra&#39;s suggestion and typed in &quot;spanking children&quot; and then<br/>\njewish, muslim and christian. It isn&#39;t obvious from the descriptions that<br/>\nJewish or Muslim hits are religious in nature. You have to actually visit<br/>\nthe pages to find religious writings quoted. And the Jewish one also looks<br/>\nto secular information to come to a conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there&#39;s no question about the Christian sites. You don&#39;t even have to<br/>\nvisit the pages to see references to the Bible. The first screenful of hits<br/>\nis down below the Jewish and Muslim sites. (If you dig into any of them<br/>\nyou&#39;ll see some mighty disturbing stuff. Not just because it&#39;s spanking, but<br/>\nbecause of the need to control and make children behave as they are supposed<br/>\nto.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the Jewish and Muslim pages that reference religous writings that I<br/>\nfound on the first screenful:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub110.ezboard.com/fgeoparentfrm226.showMessage?topicID=20.topic\">http://pub110.ezboard.com/fgeoparentfrm226.showMessage?topicID=20.topic</a><br/>\nSpare the Rod?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does Judaism advise spanking a disobedient<br/>\n&gt; child?<br/>\n&gt; The Bible says yes. The &quot;rebellious son&quot; is to<br/>\n&gt; be put to death by stoning (Deut. 21:18-21), and<br/>\n&gt; Proverbs (13:24) teaches: &quot;He who spares the rod<br/>\n&gt; hates his son.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; But by the talmudic period, these harsh doc-<br/>\n&gt; trines of parental discipline were replaced with an<br/>\n&gt; emphasis on kindness and compassion. The Tal-<br/>\n&gt; mud defines the &quot;rebellious son&quot; out of existence<br/>\n&gt; (San. 71a), rules that a teacher could punish a<br/>\n&gt; student at most with a leather shoelace (<br/>\n&gt; Bava Batra<br/>\n&gt; 21a), outlaws hitting grown children (<br/>\n&gt; Mo&#39;ed Katan<br/>\n&gt; 17a), and declares: &quot;With a child, push away with<br/>\n&gt; the left hand, and draw near with the right&quot;(<br/>\n&gt; Sotah<br/>\n&gt; 47a)-the right hand normally being the stron-<br/>\n&gt; ger. As a result of these rabbinic teachings, tradi-<br/>\n&gt; tional Jewish homes were noted for treating their<br/>\n&gt; children with love and warmth. Still, corporal pun-<br/>\n&gt; ishment was not eliminated in the traditional re-<br/>\n&gt; ligious school for boys-the<br/>\n&gt; cheder-<br/>\n&gt; in Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Europe, where teachers often hit their students<br/>\n&gt; for even minor infractions.<br/>\n&gt; Modern social science is still divided on the<br/>\n&gt; question &quot;to spank or not to spank.&quot; In 1996, Dr.<br/>\n&gt; Murray A. Straus, a professor at the University of<br/>\n&gt; New Hampshire, and Dr. Robert Larzelere of Boys<br/>\n&gt; Town began a continuing debate in the journal<br/>\n&gt; Pediatrics <br/>\n&gt; on the effectiveness of spanking. Dr.<br/>\n&gt; Straus argued that many studies, including his<br/>\n&gt; own, show that spanked children become more<br/>\n&gt; antisocial and do worse in school. Dr. Larzelere<br/>\n&gt; challenged Straus&#39;s conclusion, claiming that the<br/>\n&gt; damaging effects of spanking are true only in cases<br/>\n&gt; of frequent spanking and of corporal punishment<br/>\n&gt; of older children. For two- to six-year-olds, he<br/>\n&gt; wrote, occasional non-abusive spanking (&quot;two<br/>\n&gt; open-handed swats to the buttocks leaving no<br/>\n&gt; bruise&quot;) is beneficial as a back-up to time-outs and<br/>\n&gt; reasoning; when the children turn seven, time-<br/>\n&gt; outs and reasoning alone-with spanking in re-<br/>\n&gt; serve-have become so effective that spanking is<br/>\n&gt; no longer necessary.<br/>\n&gt; Both sides of the debate agree that spanking<br/>\n&gt; school-age children is undesirable. As for toddlers,<br/>\n&gt; nearly half of American parents oppose spanking,<br/>\n&gt; but, according to Straus, nearly all resort to cor-<br/>\n&gt; poral punishment on occasion. With the debate<br/>\n&gt; on disciplining toddlers still unsettled, A good<br/>\n&gt; Reform Jewish approach would be to err on the<br/>\n&gt; side of compassion and follow Straus&#39;s advice never<br/>\n&gt; to spank.<br/>\n&gt; - William Berkson<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/islam_ap/article.html\">http://www.geocities.com/islam_ap/article.html</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is this attitude of mercy and gentleness which I and many other Muslim<br/>\n&gt; parents believe forms a major part of Islam¹s compatibility with Attachment<br/>\n&gt; Parenting. For example, spanking of young children is explicitly prohibited<br/>\n&gt; according to Islamic law. Use of bad language and intimidation are also alien<br/>\n&gt; to the Islamic tradition, as the Qur¹an says not to use bad language unless<br/>\n&gt; one has been ³gravely wronged² and the Prophet never cursed, used bad language<br/>\n&gt; or insults, and never hit any person, animal, or inanimate object. One of his<br/>\n&gt; Companions said ³I have never seen anyone more kind to his family than the<br/>\n&gt; Messenger of Allah.² Practices such as allowing a baby to ³cry it out² in<br/>\n&gt; order to train it to sleep or eat on a schedule are considered vicious by this<br/>\n&gt; standard. The Prophet was known to be very sensitive to the cry of babies,<br/>\n&gt; even shortening the congregational prayer when he heard the babies in the<br/>\n&gt; mosque crying. He would also lengthen his solitary prayer as his grandson<br/>\n&gt; played on his back, as he did not want to disturb the child¹s play. These<br/>\n&gt; small deeds are actually very profound statements of the status of children in<br/>\n&gt; Islam, as it is prohibited to lengthen or alter the prayer in any way in order<br/>\n&gt; to accommodate other people such as somebody who may have joined the<br/>\n&gt; congregational prayer late, yet the Prophet made exceptions for children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sisters.islamway.com/viewtopic.php?topic=4418&forum=2\">http://sisters.islamway.com/viewtopic.php?topic=4418&forum=2</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The father¹s duty is to bring his children up well and to take care of them,<br/>\n&gt; and hitting may be used as a means of discipline when the situation requires<br/>\n&gt; that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to<br/>\n&gt; smack children for not praying when they reach the age of ten, but this should<br/>\n&gt; be the last resort, when all others have failed, and there should be no<br/>\n&gt; harshness in the hitting, and we must not hit the face. The father should not<br/>\n&gt; hit his child at the time of extreme anger, or with a sharp instrument that<br/>\n&gt; may injure him, or with anything that may break bones, and he should not hit<br/>\n&gt; him in a place where a blow may be fatal. Brandishing the stick may be more<br/>\n&gt; effective than actually hitting. The point is that when disciplining his<br/>\n&gt; child, a father should follow the principle of using the gentlest means then<br/>\n&gt; the next gentlest; he should not resort to the harshest and most difficult<br/>\n&gt; means if he can achieve his aim with something that is easier and gentler.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And here&#39;s just the hits from the Christian search:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; CORPORAL PUNISHMENT OF CHILDREN (SPANKING)<br/>\n&gt; ...

It is, in my <br/>\nopinion, the kind of stuff that gives Christians a very bad name.  It <br/>\nis not supposed to be what Christianity is about. :( <br/>\n<br/>\nThey actually suggest setting a child up, so that you can &quot;train&quot; him <br/>\n(with a switch) not to touch things that he shouldn&#39;t.  That way your <br/>\nchildren will obey you in public, and people will marvel at your well <br/>\nbehaved children: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Try it yourself. Place an appealing object where they can reach it, <br/>\nmaybe in a &quot;No-no&quot; corner or on an apple juice table (That&#39;s where <br/>\nthe coffee table once sat). When they spy it and make a dive for it, <br/>\nin a calm voice say, &quot;No, don&#39;t touch it.&quot; They will already be <br/>\nfamiliar with the &quot;No,&quot; so they will pause, look at you in wonder and <br/>\nthen turn around and grab it. Switch their hand once and <br/>\nsimultaneously say, &quot;No.&quot; Remember, you are not disciplining, you are <br/>\ntraining. One spat with a little switch is enough. They will again <br/>\npull back their hand and consider the relationship between the <br/>\nobject, their desire, the command and the little reinforcing pain. It <br/>\nmay take several times, but if you are consistent, they will learn to <br/>\nconsistently obey, even in your absence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand to make a wiggly toddler sit still on your lap: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;For the next weary forty-five minutes, fifteen times the child would <br/>\nmake his legs move, and the daddy would turn him around and spank his <br/>\nlegs. The father was as calm as a lazy porch swing on a Sunday <br/>\nafternoon. There was no hastiness or anger. He did not take the <br/>\ndisobedience personally. He had trained many a horse or mule and knew <br/>\nthe value of patient perseverance. In the end, the twelve-month-old <br/>\nsubmitted his will to his father, sat as he was placed, and became <br/>\ncontenteven cheerful.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85 &lt;sheran@ptd.net&gt;","from":"&quot;kayb85 &lt;sheran@...&gt;&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Spanking for Eternity WAS conservative homeschoolers","postDate":"1043468510","msgId":56255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwdDNjdStkamdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFMzE2MUMwLkI3NEFDMEIwQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":56169,"nextInTopic":56262,"prevInTime":56254,"nextInTime":56256,"topicId":55906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The thing about the U.N.
