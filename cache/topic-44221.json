Gibson<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What curriculum do you suggest for Kindergarten?&quot;This is a question I am <br/>\nfrequently asked by parents. It is also a question I find particularly <br/>\ndifficult to provide a quick, easy response to. The truth is I do not <br/>\nbelieve that a curriculum is necessary for Kindergarten, but that usually <br/>\nis not the answer parents are looking for or expect. They are certain that <br/>\nKindergarten is that magical time when suddenly what was &quot;life&quot; must become <br/>\n&quot;education&quot; and therefore needs to include workbooks, textbooks, and <br/>\norganized lessons. So they are hoping I will have ideas and suggestions for <br/>\nan organize course of study all laid out in black and white.Many parents <br/>\nhave this rosy, magical, idealized vision of public school Kindergarten and <br/>\nbelieve they need to recreate that at home. My children attended public <br/>\nschool kindergarten and believe me, there was nothing magical about it. <br/>\nKindergarten is geared towards the lowest common denominator (surprised?). <br/>\nAny child that already knows their letter sounds, how to write the alphabet <br/>\nand numbers 0-9, and do simple addition like 2+2 = 4 is going to be a very <br/>\nbored child in Kindergarten.A primary goal of kindergarten is to make good <br/>\nlittle soldiers/workers out of children. Their most important lessons <br/>\ninclude learning that they must ask permission before doing anything <br/>\n(in-cluding bathroom privileges). They are trained to follow the schedule <br/>\nat all costs. They learn to eat, play, learn, and even nap according to <br/>\nschedule with no consideration given to the individual child&#39;s needs or <br/>\nrequirements. They learn to follow directions, stand in line quietly, and <br/>\nget along with other children and the teacher without resorting to <br/>\nviolence. And probably the most important lesson is to break the emotional <br/>\nbonds with home and family. This is one result of the institution of public <br/>\nschool that I believe few parents realize until they remove their child <br/>\nfrom that system. Only then does one fully appreciate the extent to which <br/>\nauthority and control of one&#39;s children were given away.You are probably <br/>\nthinking, &quot;But what about reading and mathematics? I need a textbook to <br/>\nteach those subjects!&quot;A formal textbook curriculum follows a scope and <br/>\nsequence, a list of objectives that the child should attain by the end of <br/>\nthat particular school year through the lessons and activities provided. <br/>\nHere is a bit from a scope and sequence for <br/>\nKindergarten:1Reading/Writing·Hold books right side up and turn pages in <br/>\nthe right direction. ·Locate parts of a book such as beginning, middle, and <br/>\nend. ·Recognize and interpret familiar signs and symbols from the <br/>\nenvironment, such as stop signs. ·Recognize and say the sounds of most <br/>\nletters of the alphabet. ·Recognize their own first name ·Use letters, <br/>\ndrawings, scribbles, and gestures to tell a story. ·Retell and act out <br/>\nstories as an activity before writing. ·Begin to write left to right and <br/>\ntop to bottom. ·Begin to use one or two letters, especially initial <br/>\nconsonant sounds, to represent whole words. ·Show understanding of stories <br/>\nread to them. ·Learn and practice using new vocabulary. Math·Use ordinal <br/>\nnumber names from first to tenth. ·Compare two groups to determine which is <br/>\nmore, less or the same. ·Develop the concept of first, middle and last <br/>\nwithin a set of three objects. ·Respond to directions about location (e.g., <br/>\nabove, below, between). ·Compare objects based on size and capacity. <br/>\nScience·Begin to observe, describe, and record daily and seasonal changes <br/>\nin weather. ·Become aware of and develop appropriate habits, which will <br/>\nlead to good personal health, such as washing hands before eating. ·Begin <br/>\nto ask questions and construct explanations based on observations of <br/>\nobjects and events. History·Speak about themselves, including gender, <br/>\nethnicity, talents, and abilities. ·Distinguish between land and water <br/>\nmasses on maps and globes. ·Hear and retell stories that show how people <br/>\nmake economic choices. ·Recognize the flag of the United States. What part <br/>\nof this &quot;kindergarten learning&quot; can not be done at home? And how much of it <br/>\nrequires a textbook? How are the above &quot;requirements&quot; any different from <br/>\nthe things a parent has already very capably assisted their child in <br/>\nlearning, such as sharing with siblings, knowing when to wear a rain coat, <br/>\nbrushing teeth to prevent cavities, making good food choices, counting <br/>\nplates when setting the table, sorting laundry by colors or types of <br/>\nmaterial, selecting the most economical brand of soap, signing their name <br/>\nto Grandma&#39;s birthday card?Does a parent really need a textbook to help <br/>\ntheir child &quot;begin to ask questions and construct explanations based on <br/>\nobservations of objects and events?&quot; Does that not just mean they can look <br/>\nout the window, see the ground is wet and know that the rain causes it? If <br/>\nthey do not understand what causes the rain, will they not ask anyway, <br/>\nwithout having to wait for a textbook to ask and answer that <br/>\nquestion?Really, a parent needs only to continue what has obviously worked <br/>\nsuccessfully the first five years of their child&#39;s life ­ be patient, be <br/>\nobservant, answer their questions, read to them, play games with them, and <br/>\njust include them in your daily activities. Kindergarten, after all, is <br/>\nonly a label given to a group of children who happen to be the same age, <br/>\nand is as meaningless as all other labels. There is no age at which Life is <br/>\nnot an essential part, if not THE essential part, of education, and <br/>\nKindergarten is no exception.Here are some ways in which Life can be your <br/>\nKindergarten curriculum, things you can do with your child:·Plant a garden <br/>\n·Raise a pet ·Create a family newsletter ·Keep a scrapbook of pictures and <br/>\nother memorabilia ·Attend the local community theatres ·Purchase a <br/>\nmembership at the local YMCA ·Go hiking at a nearby National/State Park <br/>\n·Read poetry and fairy tales and fables and history and whatever else your <br/>\nchild might be interested in ·Do hands-on arts and crafts ·Find a simple <br/>\nscience experiment book at the library and try some of the experiments. <br/>\n·Play an instrument ·Take dance lessons or karate lessons or learn yoga <br/>\n·Buy some binoculars, put out some birdseed, and learn to identify birds <br/>\n·Visit museums - hands-on science, history, art, marine, planetariums, <br/>\naviation, racing, naval, automobile, etc. ·Plan a trip, using maps and <br/>\nother resource ·Make a grocery list and then go shopping ·Start giving an <br/>\nallowance ·Open a bank account ·Visit a farm ·Build a deck/porch ·Collect <br/>\nrocks ·Identify all the trees in your neighborhood ·Read a newspaper ·Make <br/>\na quilt ·Buy a few shares of stock ·Visit the ocean ·Visit a dam ·Hold a <br/>\nscavenger hunt 1A Standards-Based Scope & Sequence for Learning, New York <br/>\nCity Board of Education<br/>\n&lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nycenet.edu/dis/scopesequence/\">http://www.nycenet.edu/dis/scopesequence/</a> &gt;<br/>\nSite verified May 5, 2002<br/>\n<br/>\n©Karen M.
