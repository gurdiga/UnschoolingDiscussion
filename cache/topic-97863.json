I am not a <br/>\nChristian - but a good friend of mine who homeschools is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have been very impressed by - in my readings here - is <br/>\nthe emphasis on putting out the message of unschooling.  I have been <br/>\nfriends with this woman and her family for many years - and have <br/>\ntried to offer paltry advice to help her with her issues and her <br/>\nfamily.  I believe MOST of them stem from her rather strict school <br/>\nat home mentality and she could have so much more joy in her life <br/>\nwith her children if she was able to reconcile unschooling with her <br/>\nChristian beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case - my attempts have included advising her to try and <br/>\nthink about her kid&#39;s future and invite him to explore the world <br/>\nfrom the perspective of what he would like to do (he&#39;s a teenager)<br/>\nand loaning her a copy of the Teenage Revolution Handbook - which <br/>\nshe found full of &quot;rebeliousness&quot;.  Is there a way to reconcile <br/>\nunschooling to a family who is so restrictive that they actually go <br/>\nthrough and delete scenes from movies to bring them to a G rating?  <br/>\nIs there a way to help start them down the path?  I know they are <br/>\nall very unhappy because of the conflict in their home, and I can&#39;t <br/>\nhelp but think that unschooling does seem to have a lot of what I <br/>\nalways *thought* were the ideals of Christianity... <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize they are a LONG way away from any sort of unschooling <br/>\nframe of mind but perhaps there are books I can recommend, or a <br/>\ngroup they would find ideas they could more easily swallow...

My<br/>\n&gt; son was in public school for K and 1st grade.  He went<br/>\n&gt; into K reading on a 2nd grade level and into 1st grade<br/>\n&gt; reading on a 4th grade level.  Didn&#39;t sink into my<br/>\n&gt; dense head that maybe I knew how to teach this child,<br/>\n&gt; he was just very smart.  I mean who taught him to<br/>\n&gt; read?  So by second semester of 1st grade the school<br/>\n&gt; was pressuring me to put him on ritalin.  He was in<br/>\n&gt; the hallway more than the classroom, or the pricipals<br/>\n&gt; office or the corner.  Needless to say we didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; finish 1st grade in school.  But dummy that I was, I<br/>\n&gt; brought him home and schooled him exactly the same<br/>\n&gt; way.  Making both of us miserable.  This has gone on<br/>\n&gt; for 3 years (what can I say, I learn slow).  I decided<br/>\n&gt; that there has to be a better way to do this.  We are<br/>\n&gt; trying unschooling this year.  Computer games, lots of<br/>\n&gt; reading, hands on science experiments, field trips,<br/>\n&gt; some curriculum if he is interested.  HELP!  I am<br/>\n&gt; scared to death, guilty, worried.  We have to test<br/>\n&gt; every year through the school district and I guess I<br/>\n&gt; am such a product of public school still that the<br/>\n&gt; thought of him not doing well is daunting.  This is<br/>\n&gt; our first year learning like this and I am worried. <br/>\n&gt; But I want my child to enjoy this process.  I want to<br/>\n&gt; sit and read with him all day if that is what we want<br/>\n&gt; to do.  I want him to be happy in what we are doing. <br/>\n&gt; He is an amazing child with a tender, tender heart and<br/>\n&gt; a quick mind and I am killing that the old way.  Any<br/>\n&gt; encouragement, advice or thoughts would be greatly<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.  P.S. This whole mess is made worse by<br/>\n&gt; the fact that my 16 year old daughter has moved in<br/>\n&gt; with her dad and I am now listening to all of his mess<br/>\n&gt; because according to public schools she will have to<br/>\n&gt; repeat the 10th grade.  She is a responsible, mature,<br/>\n&gt; beautiful girl but I am a crazy person because I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want to push her to learn things that made her<br/>\n&gt; miserable.

A lot of the ideas have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seemed scary from this type of viewpoint because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they seem very opposite to a lot of &quot;Christian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ideals&quot;.  But, being me, I have thought and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pondered, tossed and turned, looked at then cast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; aside only to pick back up a LOT of my ideas and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thoughts on homeschooling and Christianity. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay... basically I am changing a lot of my thoughts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and ideas.  Instead of taking what other people tell<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (or have told) me (which I never thought I did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before but find in reality I have been too lazy to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decide/research on my own), I am looking and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figuring out for myself what I believe and how it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all fits.  (yippee)  I am in no ways &quot;there&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; close to being &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;right&quot; or whatever else<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you may want to term it; however, where I once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thought that unschooling was hugely &quot;non-Christian&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in its approach it now seems to make even more sense<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from a &quot;Christian&quot; perspective.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; One of the things that got me thinking this is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whole rules vs. principles thing.  I will LOOSELY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; paraphrase some bible stuff here - I am trying to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make sure I keep things in the right context, but am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; willing to be corrected!  Basically, from what I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand, the Jewish people were given sets of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; laws and rules to govern their lives.  These rules<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and laws were set up, in all actuality, because God<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knew that they would fail - which is why He sent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Jesus.  Jesus lived a life, and taught a life, based<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on principle - not rules. (i.e.His chat about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;working&quot; on the Sabbath)  The rules didn&#39;t work -<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they couldn&#39;t.  Humans just can not live by all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rules all the time.  Principles are what mattered,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which can be seen in the life of David.  He was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; horrible sinner and broke many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; laws/commandments/rules...  Yet, God described him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as a man after His (God&#39;s) own heart and He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loved/blessed David very much...  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, I got to thinking about punishment and raising<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children, etc...  In the Bible, God is very patient<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and merciful with His children.  He did not come out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the gate punishing and trying to hurt His beloved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children or coerce them into some choice or path to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take - He always gave them chances, advice,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; warnings, etc... WAY before punishing them, and even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; then...  He gave them choices - and like the choices<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we give our children - there were consequences that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the chooser had to deal with (good or bad), and just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like WE want our children to choose certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things/paths, God wants us to make certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choices... YET He allows us to choose ultimately<br/>\n&gt; &gt; while loving us no matter what.  I know there is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whole &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot; thing that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; people use to justify corporal punishment, but I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still researching that idea and the context in which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is written.  Many many times people can take<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things way out of context or twist scripture to fit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their end...  Additionally, from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  what I know so far it is mentioned only in OT - not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; NT scripture (though not 100% sure if it makes any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difference yet - just more digging on my part.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The Bible also says that a parent should train their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child in the way that he/she should go, and when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he/she is old they will not depart from it...  Isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that what we are doing as unschoolers?  We are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; training them in how to seek out answers to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; questions, to question the questions, to question<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the answers, to look at life critically and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; logically, and to be willing to grow and change<br/>\n&gt; &gt; through it all while taking responsibility for their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actions - good/bad/indifferent.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Finally, if (as a Christian) I am supposed to be in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this world but not of this world... then who the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; heck has the right to tell me how to raise my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; daughter?  Why MUST my child learn to read by 6<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years old, do algebra by 10, and so on...  WHY????? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to know WHY!  Why am I (and ultimately my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child) a complete failure if we don&#39;t?

Is it not my duty as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mother, human being, and &quot;Christian&quot; to allow her to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discover these things and seek them with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; vengence???

My<br/>\nson was in public school for K and 1st grade.  He went<br/>\ninto K reading on a 2nd grade level and into 1st grade<br/>\nreading on a 4th grade level.  Didn&#39;t sink into my<br/>\ndense head that maybe I knew how to teach this child,<br/>\nhe was just very smart.  I mean who taught him to<br/>\nread?  So by second semester of 1st grade the school<br/>\nwas pressuring me to put him on ritalin.  He was in<br/>\nthe hallway more than the classroom, or the pricipals<br/>\noffice or the corner.  Needless to say we didn&#39;t<br/>\nfinish 1st grade in school.  But dummy that I was, I<br/>\nbrought him home and schooled him exactly the same<br/>\nway.  Making both of us miserable.  This has gone on<br/>\nfor 3 years (what can I say, I learn slow).  I decided<br/>\nthat there has to be a better way to do this.  We are<br/>\ntrying unschooling this year.  Computer games, lots of<br/>\nreading, hands on science experiments, field trips,<br/>\nsome curriculum if he is interested.  HELP!  I am<br/>\nscared to death, guilty, worried.  We have to test<br/>\nevery year through the school district and I guess I<br/>\nam such a product of public school still that the<br/>\nthought of him not doing well is daunting.  This is<br/>\nour first year learning like this and I am worried. <br/>\nBut I want my child to enjoy this process.  I want to<br/>\nsit and read with him all day if that is what we want<br/>\nto do.  I want him to be happy in what we are doing. <br/>\nHe is an amazing child with a tender, tender heart and<br/>\na quick mind and I am killing that the old way.  Any<br/>\nencouragement, advice or thoughts would be greatly<br/>\nappreciated.  P.S. This whole mess is made worse by<br/>\nthe fact that my 16 year old daughter has moved in<br/>\nwith her dad and I am now listening to all of his mess<br/>\nbecause according to public schools she will have to<br/>\nrepeat the 10th grade.  She is a responsible, mature,<br/>\nbeautiful girl but I am a crazy person because I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to push her to learn things that made her<br/>\nmiserable.

But, being me, I have thought and<br/>\n&gt; pondered, tossed and turned, looked at then cast<br/>\n&gt; aside only to pick back up a LOT of my ideas and<br/>\n&gt; thoughts on homeschooling and Christianity. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay... basically I am changing a lot of my thoughts<br/>\n&gt; and ideas.  Instead of taking what other people tell<br/>\n&gt; (or have told) me (which I never thought I did<br/>\n&gt; before but find in reality I have been too lazy to<br/>\n&gt; decide/research on my own), I am looking and<br/>\n&gt; figuring out for myself what I believe and how it<br/>\n&gt; all fits.  (yippee)  I am in no ways &quot;there&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; close to being &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;right&quot; or whatever else<br/>\n&gt; you may want to term it; however, where I once<br/>\n&gt; thought that unschooling was hugely &quot;non-Christian&quot;<br/>\n&gt; in its approach it now seems to make even more sense<br/>\n&gt; from a &quot;Christian&quot; perspective.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the things that got me thinking this is the<br/>\n&gt; whole rules vs. principles thing.  I will LOOSELY<br/>\n&gt; paraphrase some bible stuff here - I am trying to<br/>\n&gt; make sure I keep things in the right context, but am<br/>\n&gt; willing to be corrected!  Basically, from what I<br/>\n&gt; understand, the Jewish people were given sets of<br/>\n&gt; laws and rules to govern their lives.  These rules<br/>\n&gt; and laws were set up, in all actuality, because God<br/>\n&gt; knew that they would fail - which is why He sent<br/>\n&gt; Jesus.  Jesus lived a life, and taught a life, based<br/>\n&gt; on principle - not rules. (i.e.His chat about<br/>\n&gt; &quot;working&quot; on the Sabbath)  The rules didn&#39;t work -<br/>\n&gt; they couldn&#39;t.  Humans just can not live by all the<br/>\n&gt; rules all the time.  Principles are what mattered,<br/>\n&gt; which can be seen in the life of David.  He was a<br/>\n&gt; horrible sinner and broke many<br/>\n&gt; laws/commandments/rules...  Yet, God described him<br/>\n&gt; as a man after His (God&#39;s) own heart and He<br/>\n&gt; loved/blessed David very much...  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I got to thinking about punishment and raising<br/>\n&gt; children, etc...  In the Bible, God is very patient<br/>\n&gt; and merciful with His children.  He did not come out<br/>\n&gt; of the gate punishing and trying to hurt His beloved<br/>\n&gt; children or coerce them into some choice or path to<br/>\n&gt; take - He always gave them chances, advice,<br/>\n&gt; warnings, etc... WAY before punishing them, and even<br/>\n&gt; then...  He gave them choices - and like the choices<br/>\n&gt; we give our children - there were consequences that<br/>\n&gt; the chooser had to deal with (good or bad), and just<br/>\n&gt; like WE want our children to choose certain<br/>\n&gt; things/paths, God wants us to make certain<br/>\n&gt; choices... YET He allows us to choose ultimately<br/>\n&gt; while loving us no matter what.  I know there is the<br/>\n&gt; whole &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot; thing that<br/>\n&gt; people use to justify corporal punishment, but I am<br/>\n&gt; still researching that idea and the context in which<br/>\n&gt; it is written.  Many many times people can take<br/>\n&gt; things way out of context or twist scripture to fit<br/>\n&gt; their end...  Additionally, from<br/>\n&gt;  what I know so far it is mentioned only in OT - not<br/>\n&gt; NT scripture (though not 100% sure if it makes any<br/>\n&gt; difference yet - just more digging on my part.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Bible also says that a parent should train their<br/>\n&gt; child in the way that he/she should go, and when<br/>\n&gt; he/she is old they will not depart from it...

He did not come out of the gate punishing and trying to hurt His beloved children or coerce them into some choice or path to take - He always gave them chances, advice, warnings, etc... WAY before punishing them, and even then...  He gave them choices - and like the choices we give our children - there were consequences that the chooser had to deal with (good or bad), and just like WE want our children to choose certain things/paths, God wants us to make certain choices... YET He allows us to choose ultimately while loving us no matter what.  I know there is the whole &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot; thing that people use to justify corporal punishment, but I am still researching that idea and the context in which it is written.  Many many times people can take things way out of context or twist scripture to fit their end...  Additionally, from<br/>\n what I know so far it is mentioned only in OT - not NT scripture (though not 100% sure if it makes any difference yet - just more digging on my part.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bible also says that a parent should train their child in the way that he/she should go, and when he/she is old they will not depart from it...  Isn&#39;t that what we are doing as unschoolers?  We are training them in how to seek out answers to questions, to question the questions, to question the answers, to look at life critically and logically, and to be willing to grow and change through it all while taking responsibility for their actions - good/bad/indifferent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if (as a Christian) I am supposed to be in this world but not of this world... then who the heck has the right to tell me how to raise my daughter?  Why MUST my child learn to read by 6 years old, do algebra by 10, and so on...  WHY?????  I want to know WHY!  Why am I (and ultimately my child) a complete failure if we don&#39;t?  AND FURTHERMORE!! - if I *truly* believe that God has instilled in my daughter certain talents, gifts, potential, purposes, etc...  then how/why should I stand in the way of that?  Is it not my duty as a mother, human being, and &quot;Christian&quot; to allow her to discover these things and seek them with a vengence???  Not with guilt, worry, or burdens of OTHER PEOPLE&#39;s ideas of what she *should* do or be??  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t own my child, her brain, her thoughts, or her very soul.  I have been entrusted with a precious jewel, and my responsibility is to protect her and provide the tools she needs to show and reveal her inner beauty.  *Who* my daughter is, I am realizing, is completely beyond my &quot;control&quot; - and the only thing my &quot;control&quot; will do to her is ultimately squash her true self and all that may embody.  I want no part of doing that to her!<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say, I have rediscovered joy in my daughter and in parenting since I have begun the excruciating process of &quot;deschooling&quot; and unschooling.  While I used to question my every thought/move in a reference of guilt/shame/what would so-and-so think, I find that I am questioning things in a reference of &quot;why&quot; or &quot;does it HAVE to be that way&quot; or &quot;why not&quot; - or something along those lines...  Not only has my heart suddenly become light, but I am deepening a relationship with my daughter that was only headed for disaster as the teen years quickly approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me ramble...  I hope it makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAli<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
