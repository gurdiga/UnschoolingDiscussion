In fact, at one time it was hot contender for religion of western civillisations. It has a god, a saviour who is his son, born on earth to save humanity. It might even<br/>\nhave the virgin birth, star and crucifixtion. Or that might be Tammuz who is 1000 years older than Christianity. He was born of a virgin, there was a star, wise men, evil king who killed kids under 2,<br/>\ncrucifiction and resurrection too.<br/>\nMithras did all those things too. And he&#39;s coming back. As is Tammuz and Horus and Krishna and a bunch of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56749,"nextTopicId":56777}}
