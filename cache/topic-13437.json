It can&#39;t be helped. It just happens. Your child <br/>\nwatching a candle flame is learning,  looking out of the window at <br/>\nclouds is learning.<br/>\nI suspect you mean by &#39;learning&#39; the narrow framework of <br/>\nacceptable &#39;knowledge&#39; that children are forced to learn in school. If <br/>\nyou think about the vast sum of human knowledge and then <br/>\ncompare that to the tiny section that schools have judged to be <br/>\nnecassary you can see that schooling doesn&#39;t begin to cover all <br/>\nthat it means to be a human being.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I feel that enabling my child to be a confident human <br/>\nbeing, able to make his or her own way in life is the most valuable <br/>\nability that I can help my child with. If you know &#39;how&#39; to learn and <br/>\nhow to trust your own judgement then the things that are <br/>\nnecassary to exist in this world are at your fingertips.<br/>\nIf your child feels that &#39;academic&#39; subjects are necassary to get on <br/>\nin life then those are easily acquired with unschooling too. <br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t preclude workbooks and text boooks or even <br/>\ncollege but day to day living can help a child acquire knowledge of <br/>\nthose academic subjects often without recourse to dry and boring <br/>\ntextbooks.<br/>\nA few examples...<br/>\nMaths is one of the easiest. Young children love to count and <br/>\ndescibe the porperties of objects. Songs often have counting <br/>\ngames, cookery involves fractions, multiplication and division, <br/>\nweights, measures. Sewing teaches shapes, lengths.<br/>\nChildren constantly ask questions about their environment..&#39;why is <br/>\nthe sky blue, why are flames hot, why do we eat food&#39;.<br/>\nHistory is all around us, even in the US. Me and my brood used to <br/>\nhang out in castles (I&#39;m from the UK)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the child gets older their interests become more complex. Mine <br/>\nrecently took out every book the library possessed on ancient <br/>\negyptians. My 10 yo has become interested in WW2 and asks <br/>\nendless questions of her grandma who was born in 1935 and grew <br/>\nup during the Blitz in England.<br/>\nMy 9 yo has expressed the desire to become a vet so has taken to <br/>\nasking for maths workbooks and biology textbooks. Maybe the <br/>\ninterest will pass. It is up to him.<br/>\nI am sure that if they require academic qualifications for something <br/>\nthey wish to do in the future then they are equiped to obtain that <br/>\nknowledge required for the piece of paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t question my kids to &#39;test&#39; or &#39;check&#39; on their learning. It <br/>\nis theirs alone to do with as they will. Usually they are so excited <br/>\nabout it they share it eagerly. Often when I&#39;m lying in the bath!!! My <br/>\ndaughter read all the Horrible Histories and I&#39;ve recieved a blow-by-<br/>\nblow account of nearly all the books. My son was so thrilled to <br/>\ndiscover that multiplication was really just adding up lots of times <br/>\nthat I missed an episode of Stargate while he told me all about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this seems to happen in bits and pieces. Often they do nothing <br/>\nbut slaughter things on the PlayStation for days on end and <br/>\nsometimes I feel anxious about their future but when I look at the <br/>\nbig picture, the long time frame, I see them turning into confident <br/>\nhuman beings that have many interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps. I think I rambled a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley the exile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.

Welcome to this list!  Here&#39;s a link that can be helpful.  It&#39;s <br/>\nvery short and sweet and might help you understand what unschooling <br/>\nis.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pacinfo.com/~handley/unschool.html\">http://www.pacinfo.com/~handley/unschool.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, check out <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/library/index.shtml\">http://www.unschooling.com/library/index.shtml</a> which has <br/>\nlots of essays and reading recommendations that can help you understand <br/>\nwhat this is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, unschooling is ultimately trusting your children.  It&#39;s <br/>\nknowing that your children have a natural desire to learn, and getting out <br/>\nof their way so that they can learn the way they need to.  Think about it <br/>\nthis way:  You didn&#39;t teach your children to walk and talk; they <br/>\nlearned.  It&#39;s an important distinction.  But that&#39;s how we humans do <br/>\nit.  We learn what&#39;s important for us to learn.  When a child has a need to <br/>\nlearn to read or understand the way math works, he or she learns.  We know <br/>\nwhat we need to learn, and if we&#39;re in an setting that&#39;s not pressured, we <br/>\ncan be in touch enough with ourselves to know what we need.  That&#39;s our <br/>\nrole as parents: To allow our children the space they need to be in touch <br/>\nwith themselves so they can follow their hearts and learn what they need <br/>\nand want to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s what I have gotten out of unschooling so far.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>\nnew at it, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get lots of other better answer than <br/>\nthis.  My feeling is that when children are allowed to unschool, they are <br/>\ngiven the freedom to be themselves without the pressure of others&#39; <br/>\nexpectations.  This list is very helpful in reminding each other how we can <br/>\nbest protect our children&#39;s space to be themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New member","postDate":"1035924530","msgId":48644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA5MDgwMWMyN2Y4YyQ5NzMwYzUyMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDI5MjAxNTQ3LjU5OTMucW1haWxAd2ViMTQ4MDgubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48643,"nextInTopic":48645,"prevInTime":48643,"nextInTime":48645,"topicId":13437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Renee, Try thinking about you - how do you learn things?

Do you go read a book on gardening and then write a book report? No, you read it, enjoy it, and maybe talk about it with family or friends, maybe plant a few things yourself, right? Same thing with your kids. If they&#39;re interested in something, help them find ways to learn about it - books, movies, internet, etc. They&#39;ll learn what they need to from it! Then, if they&#39;re still interested, you can offer for them to look into it more or make something related to it. We&#39;re putting finishing touches on some paper mache caterpillars that came from an idea out of some nature magazines. If you had to write a book report on every book you read, what would happen? You&#39;d soon stop reading books! Or you&#39;d read, trying to file things away to remember to put in the report, and you&#39;d not get any enjoyment or real learning out of it. If you really want or need the reassurance of hearing them talk about what they&#39;ve gotten from a book or movie, ask them.

If the kids want to do it we do it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s given us some nice family reading time. Good Luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n Mom to Samantha, Dana, and Casey<br/>\nThe World Is Our Classroom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am new to this Unschooling thing.  We have many children from blending<br/>\nfamilies together.  Some are in public school others in private, due to<br/>\nex-es choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We want to homeschool our children that live with us.  I like the sound of<br/>\nunschooling homeschool but I want to know more about it.  My brothers went<br/>\nthrough BECCA and our older daughters were in ACE.  A friend uses Bob Jones<br/>\nand another uses &quot;See Math&quot; (I think that is what it is called).  So I am<br/>\nknow about homeschooling choices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just found the web sight for FIAR which sounds good.   What else do you<br/>\ndo?  How do you know your are getting the right lessons taught for the right<br/>\nlevel of learning.  Yes I know I am still thinking of schooling but humor<br/>\nme.  I really think this might be the way we go.  I want structure with<br/>\nfreedom.

We have many children from blending families together.  Some are in public school others in private, due to ex-es choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe want to homeschool our children that live with us.  I like the sound of unschooling homeschool but I want to know more about it.  My brothers went through BECCA and our older daughters were in ACE.  A friend uses Bob Jones and another uses &quot;See Math&quot; (I think that is what it is called).  So I am know about homeschooling choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just found the web sight for FIAR which sounds good.   What else do you do?  How do you know your are getting the right lessons taught for the right level of learning.  Yes I know I am still thinking of schooling but humor me.  I really think this might be the way we go.  I want structure with freedom.  I will be homeschooling with babies running around so I need that freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one this year is the right age and living with us.
