I think it helps <br/>\nif you try to put what the kids are doing in public school out of your mind <br/>\nand do some of the things that you haven&#39;t had time for in the past. Go to <br/>\nsome different places. Do zoos, and museums and festivals. Go to a library <br/>\nin a different city. Take the time to stop at a park that you have never <br/>\nbeen to, or to one you loved when she was little. If you see a class or <br/>\nworkshop offered at a craft shop that interests her-or if it only interests <br/>\nyou, sign up. Do something that you yourself have always wanted to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis new way of learning does take some time. Its different to be able to do <br/>\nwhat you want instead of having someone tell you what you will learn about, <br/>\nand after years of regular school we often have forgotten what our own <br/>\ninterests and talents really are. Many of us-kids and adults-have gotten so <br/>\naccustomed to a curriculum and a scope and sequence that we don&#39;t see the <br/>\nvalue in things that we do because we love them-they are playing, or <br/>\nhobbies, not schoolwork. But if you take the plunge and follow your <br/>\ninterests without regard to a school mind set you will see the learning that <br/>\njust happens. And one thing leads naturally into another-a free workshop at <br/>\nHome Depot on building a bird house can lead to a whole new interest in <br/>\nbackyard birdwatching, then on to migratory patterns, habitat, landscaping, <br/>\nweather, wetlands...see how it all does sound schooly now?! Maybe that won&#39;t <br/>\nhappen with one class, but the next one may ignite a life long passion, so <br/>\njust keep trying out new things and have fun together.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"braunville@aol.com","from":"braunville@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_dgqouMvLf9eu6q3gGnqeqqNW-I4S0SZZiLi8_HzNwb7uCuHjVwxT9J6QI-wXDcZfnYYkKknqeF2","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] bed time math etc","postDate":"967501106","msgId":12240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwLmE2NWIyMWQuMjZkYzNmMzJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12238,"nextInTopic":12253,"prevInTime":12239,"nextInTime":12241,"topicId":12237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/28/2000 12:34:10 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...
