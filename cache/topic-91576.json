I was <br/>\nreminded of it just last week when Holly was talking about her teeth and started <br/>\noff saying, &quot;I brushed my teeth for a month and...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I brushed the kids&#39; teeth when they were little, I would sing to the <br/>\ntune of Yankee Doodle:<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday, Monday Tuesday, Wednesday,<br/>\nThursday, Friday, SAaaaturday...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the days of the week fit perfectly into that tune four times--a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo before they were old enough to know or care what day it was, they had a <br/>\nsong that was days of the week and the basic length of a month.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I would tell them when they had more teeth they would have to brush MORE <br/>\nthan a month, and I would  hum while I brushed mine and it would take at least <br/>\ntwo months. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I&#39;m really skeptical about the true value of the whole <br/>\ntoothbrushing package, the three times a day, floss, etc.   Not saying it&#39;s never good, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m absolutely suspicious that it&#39;s part of the problem itself.  Douching <br/>\nevery day is/was/has been a problem.  Some women got the &quot;cleanliness&quot; thing to <br/>\nthe point (years ago) that they would douche with vinegar LOTS.  Tons.  And <br/>\nthere are things supposed to be inside us.  We&#39;re not SUPPOSED to be <br/>\nanti-bioticized.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Holly brushed with baking soda and salt.  She had before, but not <br/>\nfor a long time.  She was just skipping around saying &quot;That felt so good!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps, maybe, just mix it up and don&#39;t have the same routine, same <br/>\ntoothpaste, same place, same time.  And same toothbrush?  For how long?  People who <br/>\nwon&#39;t drink out of the same cup they used the day before without washing it will <br/>\nuse the same toothbrush for a year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91572,"nextTopicId":91553}}
