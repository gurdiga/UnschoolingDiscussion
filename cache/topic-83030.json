When I think of violence I am not only thinking of physica=\r<br/>\nl <br/>\nviolence, I am thinking of the way we communicate with each other with our =\r<br/>\n<br/>\nwords. I think of how we label and accuse each other of wrong doing rather =\r<br/>\n<br/>\nthan asking for what we want in life so we give others the chance to meet o=\r<br/>\nur <br/>\nneeds for peace, safety and joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am alarmed and annoyed that we still seek to blame something or someone. =\r<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what annoyed me about the homeschooling report. That <br/>\nhomeschooling was blamed for the abuse the children received. I neither <br/>\nwant to blame homeschooling or school for violence children experience. I <br/>\nsee acts of violence to children often. I have seen children spanked which =\r<br/>\n<br/>\ndidn&#39;t meet the child&#39;s need for physical safety. I have heard children sha=\r<br/>\nmed <br/>\nwhen they spoke up for what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think of safety and peace for children, I want to focus on how we he=\r<br/>\nal <br/>\nourselves as parents. I believe only someone in deep, deep pain could do <br/>\nwhat happened in the stories shared on the news. Only someone in deep <br/>\npain could go into a school and shoot their friends and teachers. Only <br/>\nsomeone in deep pain could kill their siblings and then kill himself. These=\r<br/>\n <br/>\ntragic situations need our attention to meet our needs for healing and safe=\r<br/>\nty. <br/>\nWhat triggered the pain in the children who kill their friends? What trigge=\r<br/>\nred <br/>\nthe pain in the parents who killed their children? I think to blame the tra=\r<br/>\ngic <br/>\nevents on school or homeschooling is overly simplistic and prevents us from=\r<br/>\n <br/>\ndigging deeper into the tragic events to find solutions that create peace a=\r<br/>\nnd <br/>\nhealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not believe that more regulations will ensure the prevention of these =\r<br/>\n<br/>\ntragedies. We have enough regulation. What I wish for is healing the pain s=\r<br/>\no <br/>\nwe can prevent tragic events from ever occurring. I want parents to get hel=\r<br/>\np so <br/>\nthey can heal their deep wounds, so that they can love their children. All =\r<br/>\n<br/>\nchildren need thisall humans need this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I want reporting that gets to the heart of the issue for me, which is s=\r<br/>\nafety <br/>\nand peace. I want reporting that removes the interpretations out of the <br/>\nobservations. I want reporting that sticks with the facts and brings our fe=\r<br/>\nelings <br/>\nand needs into consideration without over using our feeling of fear and nee=\r<br/>\nd <br/>\nfor safety. Would you be willing to do this? Take the interpretations and b=\r<br/>\nlame <br/>\nout of your reporting? Would you be willing to report what is triggering th=\r<br/>\ne <br/>\npain in the parents that manifests in tragedy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha M.
