My religious beliefs include respecting the decisions and<br/>\ndifferences of others and not thinking that I have a monopoly on truth or<br/>\nthe &quot;one right way&quot; to do anything.  This includes lifestyle choices like<br/>\nfamily dynamics.  When we start to say it &quot;should be this way&quot; or &quot;that is<br/>\nthe wrong way&quot; we have to examine our reasons for thinking this.  We are<br/>\npointing fingers here and we had better have a damned good reason for doing<br/>\nit.  Are these opinions purely motivated by a respect for others and a<br/>\ndesire to  aid and encourage them along a life path that makes them happy<br/>\nand brings them fulfillment?  Or are we passing judgements on others based<br/>\non the idea that we know &quot;the truth?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2265,"nextTopicId":2284}}
