Now, I get mine on<br/>\ndigest, in Europe, so my concept of &quot;days&quot; doesn&#39;t look quite like yours,<br/>\nperhaps.  But today, and in the last couple days, I&#39;ve read several people&#39;s<br/>\ncomments on how they know unschooling is working for them, posted in<br/>\nresponse to a request by someone.  I&#39;ve participated in a discussion about<br/>\nhomeschooling and unschooling in the military, and in states with somewhat<br/>\nmore iritating laws.  And I&#39;ve read some interesting comments on Rap, which<br/>\nI know absolutely nothing about, which have been enlightening and also<br/>\nsomewhat iritating.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed, I like this list.  I don&#39;t consider myself an old-timer, since I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen here since March or April (I forget which).  But I have enjoyed the<br/>\ndiversity of subjects and the diversity of opinions.
