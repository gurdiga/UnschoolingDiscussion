I have a friend who lived in the same area of the Redwoods <br/>\nand she said that she knew several families exactly like this - <br/>\nrelatively isolated unschoolers 30+ miles back in the woods. Not <br/>\nunlikely, but still not the norm for homeschoolers, of course. I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it would&#39;ve worked for her plot to have them less <br/>\nisolated, and indeed, the author homeschooled her kids on 55 acres in <br/>\nthe redwood forest, so perhaps it&#39;s more than a bit autobiographical.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as an author, I have a homeschooling character in my 2nd novel <br/>\nand I have to say it&#39;s pretty tough to think about the way his <br/>\ncharacter presents vs. what his character really is. He&#39;s being <br/>\nhomeschooled because he&#39;s very gifted and his mom didn&#39;t think he was <br/>\nwell served in the school system. But he&#39;s not unschooled, and his <br/>\ntwo siblings are in school. The mom&#39;s character is just not that of a <br/>\nhomeschooler. So although I would love to present unschooling in my <br/>\nown fiction, the truth of it is that the characters are who they are, <br/>\nnot who I&#39;d like them to be for my own reasons (presenting <br/>\nunschooling to the world). It always feels weird to me to have my <br/>\ncharacters have different experiences/make different choices than I <br/>\nwould make, but they are their own people, they&#39;re not me.
