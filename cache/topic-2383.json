The<br/>\ncurriculum of the Waldorf schools I have seen is different (and in good<br/>\nways) from your run-of-the-mill public school, but in the strictures<br/>\nplaced upon children by even having a curriculum (one-size-fits-all)<br/>\napproach, it is profoundly similar to public education.  I honestly<br/>\ndon&#39;t think Steiner would have approved, at least of what I have seen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I strongly feel that all of the debate over homeschooling in the<br/>\n&gt; elementary<br/>\n&gt; and secondary years is so misguided; we should all really be working<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; universal higher education.  The world would be a vastly different<br/>\n&gt; place if<br/>\n&gt; everyone could go to college/grad school and study and do what they<br/>\n&gt; want to<br/>\n&gt; do, and contribute their God-given gifts towards a better world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is happening in colleges and grad schools these days (I&#39;m perhaps<br/>\novergeneralizing) is also so disheartening.  First of all, they must<br/>\ndeal with the learning diseases kids coming out of public education<br/>\nbring with them.  Next, the dumbing down of liberal education for the<br/>\npurpose of providing a few required courses so the students can get on<br/>\nwith the real business of careering.  Finally, so much of its has become<br/>\na business in and of itself that sometimes it almost seems that the fact<br/>\nthat learning is supposed to take place there is almost an afterthought.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, enough of that.  Let us know how your experiment with the &quot;open&quot;<br/>\npublic school works out!<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2378,"nextTopicId":2175}}
