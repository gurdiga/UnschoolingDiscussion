I&#39;m being honest here, I normally don&#39;t <br/>\ntell people any of this anymore because they don&#39;t believe me or they think I&#39;m <br/>\nstrange! <br/>\nFor example about 2 years ago, I was washing dishes and I had this thought <br/>\nthat my parents (who are retired and live alone) would have their house broken <br/>\ninto. No reason why, I was just doing dishes. I told my parents that night <br/>\nbecause this thought bugged me all day. They told me that they would make sure to <br/>\nlock the doors and they did every night. 10 days later, my parents woke in the <br/>\nmiddle of the night to an intruder in the house who was going through my <br/>\nmothers jewelry. This guy had got in through a window, the doors were locked. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother said when I was little I would always say things like that I vision <br/>\nsomething happening/had happened or I know that person is up to no good and <br/>\nso on. As I get older though I find that I have more and more vibes when <br/>\nmeeting people and more visions & thoughts during the day but none at night while I <br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother one of the many thoughts I had was on my wedding day. When I said &quot;I <br/>\nDo&quot; to my then husband.&lt;g&gt;Really! I had this awful thought that I would not be <br/>\nwith this man, who I thought I loved very much, for more than a year. I <br/>\nchalked it up to insecurity but thought it was odd because I&#39;ve really never been <br/>\ninsecure BUT I did have a funny feeling about him. My parents said it was <br/>\nprobably that I was scared to get married because I was young. 11 months after the <br/>\nwedding, he left and took everything we owned with him, including all of our <br/>\nmoney! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned over the years to pay more attention to my thoughts, vibes and <br/>\nsuch. I really believed for along time that maybe I had these thoughts because <br/>\nI wanted things like that to happen. I am definitely learning otherwise!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first day I took our son to the new school here (we had just moved here), <br/>\nI had a really odd feeling come over me. Weird but true. As my husband and I <br/>\nstood there waiting for our son to enter the school (he was standing in line) <br/>\nI saw this boy waiting in another line for a different class than our sons. I <br/>\nthought that the boy was trouble and that he would one day cause our son a lot <br/>\nof misery. He was just standing there! My husband told me that was <br/>\nridiculous, the kid wasn&#39;t even in our sons class, just the mommy worries. After 3 <br/>\nmonths of school, that same boy was transferred to our sons class because he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get along with the kids in the class he was in. He tormented our son every <br/>\nday and in the end he was the leader of the kids that caused our sons injuries.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim   With her strange but true experiences&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There is NO GOOD/BAD, people!

Often the subjects have changed a week later, or the<br/>\nextroverts have already articulated it well enough.   But communicating<br/>\nin articles or books is good....if you can get readers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd again,  many introverts are excellent public speakers or communicate<br/>\nwell with small groups.  I think introverts would be important for grass<br/>\nroots movements.  And I think Brenda pointed out....introverts DO<br/>\nfunction well in large groups,  but would not choose to spend lots of<br/>\ntime there,  and may need alone time to recuperate from the energy<br/>\ndrain.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Tracy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sablehs@...\">sablehs@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 10, 2003 11:49 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Introverts<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, starsuncloud@c... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/10/2003 2:51:27 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes: <br/>\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re all Extroverts!

Who loves quiet <br/>\nconversations about feelings or ideas, and can give a dynamite <br/>\npresentation to a big audience, but seems awkward in groups and <br/>\nmaladroit at small talk? Who has to be dragged to parties and then <br/>\nneeds the rest of the day to recuperate? Who growls or scowls or <br/>\ngrunts or winces when accosted with pleasantries by people who are <br/>\njust trying to be nice?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, do you tell this person he is &quot;too serious,&quot; or ask if he is <br/>\nokay? Regard him as aloof, arrogant, rude? Redouble your efforts to <br/>\ndraw him out?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you answered yes to these questions, chances are that you have an <br/>\nintrovert on your hands-and that you aren&#39;t caring for him properly. <br/>\nScience has learned a good deal in recent years about the habits and <br/>\nrequirements of introverts. It has even learned, by means of brain <br/>\nscans, that introverts process information differently from other <br/>\npeople (I am not making this up). If you are behind the curve on this <br/>\nimportant matter, be reassured that you are not alone. Introverts may <br/>\nbe common, but they are also among the most misunderstood and <br/>\naggrieved groups in America, possibly the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know. My name is Jonathan, and I am an introvert.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, for years I denied it. After all, I have good social skills. I am <br/>\nnot morose or misanthropic. Usually. I am far from shy. I love long <br/>\nconversations that explore intimate thoughts or passionate interests. <br/>\nBut at last I have self-identified and come out to my friends and <br/>\ncolleagues. In doing so, I have found myself liberated from any <br/>\nnumber of damaging misconceptions and stereotypes. Now I am here to <br/>\ntell you what you need to know in order to respond sensitively and <br/>\nsupportively to your own introverted family members, friends, and <br/>\ncolleagues. Remember, someone you know, respect, and interact with <br/>\nevery day is an introvert, and you are probably driving this person <br/>\nnuts. It pays to learn the warning signs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is introversion? In its modern sense, the concept goes back to <br/>\nthe 1920s and the psychologist Carl Jung. Today it is a mainstay of <br/>\npersonality tests, including the widely used Myers-Briggs Type <br/>\nIndicator. Introverts are not necessarily shy. Shy people are anxious <br/>\nor frightened or self-excoriating in social settings; introverts <br/>\ngenerally are not. Introverts are also not misanthropic, though some <br/>\nof us do go along with Sartre as far as to say &quot;Hell is other people <br/>\nat breakfast.&quot; Rather, introverts are people who find other people <br/>\ntiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtroverts are energized by people, and wilt or fade when alone. They <br/>\noften seem bored by themselves, in both senses of the _expression. <br/>\nLeave an extrovert alone for two minutes and he will reach for his <br/>\ncell phone. In contrast, after an hour or two of being socially &quot;on,&quot; <br/>\nwe introverts need to turn off and recharge. My own formula is <br/>\nroughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing. This isn&#39;t <br/>\nantisocial. It isn&#39;t a sign of depression. It does not call for <br/>\nmedication. For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts is as <br/>\nrestorative as sleeping, as nourishing as eating. Our motto: &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nokay, you&#39;re okay-in small doses.&quot;<br/>\nHow many people are introverts? I performed exhaustive research on <br/>\nthis question, in the form of a quick Google search. The answer: <br/>\nAbout 25 percent. Or: Just under half. Or-my favorite-&quot;a minority in <br/>\nthe regular population but a majority in the gifted population.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre introverts misunderstood? Wildly. That, it appears, is our lot in <br/>\nlife. &quot;It is very difficult for an extrovert to understand an <br/>\nintrovert,&quot; write the education experts Jill D. Burruss and Lisa <br/>\nKaenzig. (They are also the source of the quotation in the previous <br/>\nparagraph.) Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand, because <br/>\nextroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in <br/>\nvoluble, and frequently inescapable, interaction with other people. <br/>\nThey are as inscrutable as puppy dogs. But the street does not run <br/>\nboth ways. Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion. They <br/>\nassume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They <br/>\ncannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often <br/>\ntake umbrage at the suggestion. As often as I have tried to explain <br/>\nthe matter to extroverts, I have never sensed that any of them really <br/>\nunderstood. They listen for a moment and then go back to barking and <br/>\nyipping.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre introverts oppressed? I would have to say so. For one thing, <br/>\nextroverts are overrepresented in politics, a profession in which <br/>\nonly the garrulous are really comfortable. Look at George W. Bush. <br/>\nLook at Bill Clinton. They seem to come fully to life only around <br/>\nother people. To think of the few introverts who did rise to the top <br/>\nin politics-Calvin Coolidge, Richard Nixon-is merely to drive home <br/>\nthe point. With the possible exception of Ronald Reagan, whose fabled <br/>\naloofness and privateness were probably signs of a deep introverted <br/>\nstreak (many actors, I&#39;ve read, are introverts, and many introverts, <br/>\nwhen socializing, feel like actors), introverts are not <br/>\nconsidered &quot;naturals&quot; in politics.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtroverts therefore dominate public life. This is a pity. If we <br/>\nintroverts ran the world, it would no doubt be a calmer, saner, more <br/>\npeaceful sort of place. As Coolidge is supposed to have said, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>\nyou know that four fifths of all our troubles in this life would <br/>\ndisappear if we would just sit down and keep still?&quot; (He is also <br/>\nsupposed to have said, &quot;If you don&#39;t say anything, you won&#39;t be <br/>\ncalled on to repeat it.&quot; The only thing a true introvert dislikes <br/>\nmore than talking about himself is repeating himself.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith their endless appetite for talk and attention, extroverts also <br/>\ndominate social life, so they tend to set expectations. In our <br/>\nextrovertist society, being outgoing is considered normal and <br/>\ntherefore desirable, a mark of happiness, confidence, leadership. <br/>\nExtroverts are seen as bighearted, vibrant, warm, empathic. &quot;People <br/>\nperson&quot; is a compliment. Introverts are described with words <br/>\nlike &quot;guarded,&quot; &quot;loner,&quot; &quot;reserved,&quot; &quot;taciturn,&quot; &quot;self-<br/>\ncontained,&quot; &quot;private&quot;-narrow, ungenerous words, words that suggest <br/>\nemotional parsimony and smallness of personality. Female introverts, <br/>\nI suspect, must suffer especially. In certain circles, particularly <br/>\nin the Midwest, a man can still sometimes get away with being what <br/>\nthey used to call a strong and silent type; introverted women, <br/>\nlacking that alternative, are even more likely than men to be <br/>\nperceived as timid, withdrawn, haughty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre introverts arrogant? Hardly. I suppose this common misconception <br/>\nhas to do with our being more intelligent, more reflective, more <br/>\nindependent, more level-headed, more refined, and more sensitive than <br/>\nextroverts. Also, it is probably due to our lack of small talk, a <br/>\nlack that extroverts often mistake for disdain. We tend to think <br/>\nbefore talking, whereas extroverts tend to think by talking, which is <br/>\nwhy their meetings never last less than six hours. &quot;Introverts,&quot; <br/>\nwrites a perceptive fellow named Thomas P. Crouser, in an online <br/>\nreview of a recent book called Why Should Extroverts Make All the <br/>\nMoney? (I&#39;m not making that up, either), &quot;are driven to distraction <br/>\nby the semi-internal dialogue extroverts tend to conduct. Introverts <br/>\ndon&#39;t outwardly complain, instead roll their eyes and silently curse <br/>\nthe darkness.&quot; Just so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worst of it is that extroverts have no idea of the torment they <br/>\nput us through. Sometimes, as we gasp for air amid the fog of their <br/>\n98-percent-content-free talk, we wonder if extroverts even bother to <br/>\nlisten to themselves. Still, we endure stoically, because the <br/>\netiquette books-written, no doubt, by extroverts-regard declining to <br/>\nbanter as rude and gaps in conversation as awkward. We can only dream <br/>\nthat someday, when our condition is more widely understood, when <br/>\nperhaps an Introverts&#39; Rights movement has blossomed and borne fruit, <br/>\nit will not be impolite to say &quot;I&#39;m an introvert. You are a wonderful <br/>\nperson and I like you. But now please shush.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I let the introvert in my life know that I support him and <br/>\nrespect his choice? First, recognize that it&#39;s not a choice. It&#39;s not <br/>\na lifestyle. It&#39;s an orientation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don&#39;t say &quot;What&#39;s <br/>\nthe matter?&quot; or &quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, don&#39;t say anything else, either. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Who has to be dragged to parties and then <br/>\nneeds the rest of the day to recuperate? Who growls or scowls or <br/>\ngrunts or winces when accosted with pleasantries by people who are <br/>\njust trying to be nice?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, do you tell this person he is &quot;too serious,&quot; or ask if he is <br/>\nokay? Regard him as aloof, arrogant, rude? Redouble your efforts to <br/>\ndraw him out?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you answered yes to these questions, chances are that you have an <br/>\nintrovert on your hands-and that you aren&#39;t caring for him properly. <br/>\nScience has learned a good deal in recent years about the habits and <br/>\nrequirements of introverts. It has even learned, by means of brain <br/>\nscans, that introverts process information differently from other <br/>\npeople (I am not making this up). If you are behind the curve on this <br/>\nimportant matter, be reassured that you are not alone. Introverts may <br/>\nbe common, but they are also among the most misunderstood and <br/>\naggrieved groups in America, possibly the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know. My name is Jonathan, and I am an introvert.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, for years I denied it. After all, I have good social skills. I am <br/>\nnot morose or misanthropic. Usually. I am far from shy. I love long <br/>\nconversations that explore intimate thoughts or passionate interests. <br/>\nBut at last I have self-identified and come out to my friends and <br/>\ncolleagues. In doing so, I have found myself liberated from any <br/>\nnumber of damaging misconceptions and stereotypes. Now I am here to <br/>\ntell you what you need to know in order to respond sensitively and <br/>\nsupportively to your own introverted family members, friends, and <br/>\ncolleagues. Remember, someone you know, respect, and interact with <br/>\nevery day is an introvert, and you are probably driving this person <br/>\nnuts. It pays to learn the warning signs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is introversion? In its modern sense, the concept goes back to <br/>\nthe 1920s and the psychologist Carl Jung. Today it is a mainstay of <br/>\npersonality tests, including the widely used Myers-Briggs Type <br/>\nIndicator. Introverts are not necessarily shy. Shy people are anxious <br/>\nor frightened or self-excoriating in social settings; introverts <br/>\ngenerally are not. Introverts are also not misanthropic, though some <br/>\nof us do go along with Sartre as far as to say &quot;Hell is other people <br/>\nat breakfast.&quot; Rather, introverts are people who find other people <br/>\ntiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtroverts are energized by people, and wilt or fade when alone. They <br/>\noften seem bored by themselves, in both senses of the _expression. <br/>\nLeave an extrovert alone for two minutes and he will reach for his <br/>\ncell phone. In contrast, after an hour or two of being socially &quot;on,&quot; <br/>\nwe introverts need to turn off and recharge. My own formula is <br/>\nroughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing. This isn&#39;t <br/>\nantisocial. It isn&#39;t a sign of depression. It does not call for <br/>\nmedication. For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts is as <br/>\nrestorative as sleeping, as nourishing as eating. Our motto: &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nokay, you&#39;re okay-in small doses.&quot;<br/>\nHow many people are introverts? I performed exhaustive research on <br/>\nthis question, in the form of a quick Google search. The answer: <br/>\nAbout 25 percent. Or: Just under half. Or-my favorite-&quot;a minority in <br/>\nthe regular population but a majority in the gifted population.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre introverts misunderstood? Wildly. That, it appears, is our lot in <br/>\nlife. &quot;It is very difficult for an extrovert to understand an <br/>\nintrovert,&quot; write the education experts Jill D. Burruss and Lisa <br/>\nKaenzig. (They are also the source of the quotation in the previous <br/>\nparagraph.) Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand, because <br/>\nextroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in <br/>\nvoluble, and frequently inescapable, interaction with other people. <br/>\nThey are as inscrutable as puppy dogs. But the street does not run <br/>\nboth ways. Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion. They <br/>\nassume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They <br/>\ncannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often <br/>\ntake umbrage at the suggestion. As often as I have tried to explain <br/>\nthe matter to extroverts, I have never sensed that any of them really <br/>\nunderstood. They listen for a moment and then go back to barking and <br/>\nyipping.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre introverts oppressed? I would have to say so. For one thing, <br/>\nextroverts are overrepresented in politics, a profession in which <br/>\nonly the garrulous are really comfortable. Look at George W. Bush. <br/>\nLook at Bill Clinton. They seem to come fully to life only around <br/>\nother people. To think of the few introverts who did rise to the top <br/>\nin politics-Calvin Coolidge, Richard Nixon-is merely to drive home <br/>\nthe point. With the possible exception of Ronald Reagan, whose fabled <br/>\naloofness and privateness were probably signs of a deep introverted <br/>\nstreak (many actors, I&#39;ve read, are introverts, and many introverts, <br/>\nwhen socializing, feel like actors), introverts are not <br/>\nconsidered &quot;naturals&quot; in politics.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtroverts therefore dominate public life. This is a pity. If we <br/>\nintroverts ran the world, it would no doubt be a calmer, saner, more <br/>\npeaceful sort of place. As Coolidge is supposed to have said, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>\nyou know that four fifths of all our troubles in this life would <br/>\ndisappear if we would just sit down and keep still?&quot; (He is also <br/>\nsupposed to have said, &quot;If you don&#39;t say anything, you won&#39;t be <br/>\ncalled on to repeat it.&quot; The only thing a true introvert dislikes <br/>\nmore than talking about himself is repeating himself.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith their endless appetite for talk and attention, extroverts also <br/>\ndominate social life, so they tend to set expectations. In our <br/>\nextrovertist society, being outgoing is considered normal and <br/>\ntherefore desirable, a mark of happiness, confidence, leadership. <br/>\nExtroverts are seen as bighearted, vibrant, warm, empathic. &quot;People <br/>\nperson&quot; is a compliment. Introverts are described with words <br/>\nlike &quot;guarded,&quot; &quot;loner,&quot; &quot;reserved,&quot; &quot;taciturn,&quot; &quot;self-<br/>\ncontained,&quot; &quot;private&quot;-narrow, ungenerous words, words that suggest <br/>\nemotional parsimony and smallness of personality. Female introverts, <br/>\nI suspect, must suffer especially. In certain circles, particularly <br/>\nin the Midwest, a man can still sometimes get away with being what <br/>\nthey used to call a strong and silent type; introverted women, <br/>\nlacking that alternative, are even more likely than men to be <br/>\nperceived as timid, withdrawn, haughty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre introverts arrogant? Hardly. I suppose this common misconception <br/>\nhas to do with our being more intelligent, more reflective, more <br/>\nindependent, more level-headed, more refined, and more sensitive than <br/>\nextroverts. Also, it is probably due to our lack of small talk, a <br/>\nlack that extroverts often mistake for disdain. We tend to think <br/>\nbefore talking, whereas extroverts tend to think by talking, which is <br/>\nwhy their meetings never last less than six hours. &quot;Introverts,&quot; <br/>\nwrites a perceptive fellow named Thomas P. Crouser, in an online <br/>\nreview of a recent book called Why Should Extroverts Make All the <br/>\nMoney? (I&#39;m not making that up, either), &quot;are driven to distraction <br/>\nby the semi-internal dialogue extroverts tend to conduct. Introverts <br/>\ndon&#39;t outwardly complain, instead roll their eyes and silently curse <br/>\nthe darkness.&quot; Just so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worst of it is that extroverts have no idea of the torment they <br/>\nput us through. Sometimes, as we gasp for air amid the fog of their <br/>\n98-percent-content-free talk, we wonder if extroverts even bother to <br/>\nlisten to themselves. Still, we endure stoically, because the <br/>\netiquette books-written, no doubt, by extroverts-regard declining to <br/>\nbanter as rude and gaps in conversation as awkward. We can only dream <br/>\nthat someday, when our condition is more widely understood, when <br/>\nperhaps an Introverts&#39; Rights movement has blossomed and borne fruit, <br/>\nit will not be impolite to say &quot;I&#39;m an introvert. You are a wonderful <br/>\nperson and I like you. But now please shush.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I let the introvert in my life know that I support him and <br/>\nrespect his choice? First, recognize that it&#39;s not a choice. It&#39;s not <br/>\na lifestyle. It&#39;s an orientation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don&#39;t say &quot;What&#39;s <br/>\nthe matter?&quot; or &quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, don&#39;t say anything else, either.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Myers-Briggs","postDate":"1055303336","msgId":73625,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2LjJlODE4MDJlLjJjMTgwMGE4QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73624,"nextInTopic":73630,"prevInTime":73624,"nextInTime":73626,"topicId":73505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/10/2003 4:01:09 PM Central Daylight Time, ...

I agree with Julie<br/>\nthat the NF combo is a great type for unschoolers (in general).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really think having four children had turned me into a &quot;J&quot;.  I have<br/>\nalways hung on that borderline, but  I realized last year what an<br/>\nextreme planner I had become.  That all changed when we moved and both<br/>\nmy parents became critically ill at the same time.  I learned that<br/>\nplanning for much more than the next moment was almost useless.  I am<br/>\nmuch more strongly in the &quot;go with the flow&quot;, spontaneity live in the<br/>\nmoment and don&#39;t think of tomorrow mode these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love to talk to ENFs ....they seem to extrovert what I introvert!<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95003301,"authorName":"Tammy Thompson","from":"&quot;Tammy Thompson&quot; &lt;qpwithcheese@...&gt;","profile":"tammyof4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Myers-Briggs","postDate":"1055274349","msgId":73523,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFRTYzNTZELjAwMDAwMS4wMTUyNEByb3NpZT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJCMEJGMjlBLjI4ODIlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":73521,"nextInTopic":73528,"prevInTime":73522,"nextInTime":73524,"topicId":73505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
