The sun doesn&#39;t set here this time of year.<br/>\nIt gets pretty low<br/>\nin the sky, but it&#39;s certainly still light enough to<br/>\nsee clearly.  We<br/>\nwon&#39;t have &quot;pitch black&quot; until wintertime.  Our days<br/>\nwill get<br/>\nprogressively shorter until mid-December, when we<br/>\nwill only have<br/>\nsunlight for about 2-3 hours (and even then, it&#39;s<br/>\nnot &quot;bright&quot; by any<br/>\nstretch of the imagination).  This drastic change<br/>\ndoes bother some folks<br/>\na great deal, but I&#39;ve been here now for over 20<br/>\nyears, so I&#39;m used to<br/>\nit.  My husband took me to Seattle a few years back<br/>\nfor Mother&#39;s Day ...<br/>\nwe were there for an extended weekend... I thought<br/>\nit&#39;s was SOOOOO weird<br/>\nthat it was &quot;nighttime&quot; at 8pm in MAY!!!  Here, it<br/>\nstill looks like the<br/>\nafternoon at 2am that time of year!<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise:<br/>\n<br/>\nYep.  Santa&#39;s house is still here!
