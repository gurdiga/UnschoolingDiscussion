I look back and see a very lonely childhood.  When <br/>\nI was really young I remember taking 1-2 classes but there was never <br/>\nany support or interest and then nothing.  I remember asking to join <br/>\nthe girl scouts when I was in second grade and my parent said no.  <br/>\nSo, personally I feel like there are so many things I was never <br/>\nallowed to explore.  For example, My father had hoped he would get a <br/>\nsinger in the family.  Unfortunately, neither me nor my sister showed <br/>\npromise by preschool age and so my father refused to teach us to sing <br/>\nor have us learn any musical instruments.  He gave us such a Damn <br/>\ncomplex that I refuse to sing out loud to this day.  LOL...I always <br/>\nlip sync to songs &lt;g&gt;!  Realistically, I don&#39;t think we are that <br/>\nhorrible and certainly could have learned to carry a tune if he had <br/>\ntaken the time.  My sister was a great artist and my parents never <br/>\ngave her the support to do something with it.  Her life is now a <br/>\nbasic mess with one career problem after another.  I was watching <br/>\nRiverdance last night and felt a little sad that there were all these <br/>\namazing things I never got to try, things I may have loved or been <br/>\ngood at.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to say I don&#39;t have interests now, but I lack that feeling of I <br/>\ncan conquer anything. Although, I am trying to fight that as I <br/>\ndeschool myself.  I think that is one reason I unschool, so that my <br/>\nchildren get opportunities I never had.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie Solich&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mjsolich@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m still reading WishCraft that I dl&#39;d on Adobe.
