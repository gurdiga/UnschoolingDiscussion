However, if you get interested in John Holt&#39;s life and how he came to his ideas these might be interesting to you.  I also like A Life Worth Living which is edited by Susannah Sheffer and includes his many letters throughout his life. Never Too Late is a fascinating look at the way he taught himself to play the cello.  Interesting if you like that sort of thing, though not really about homeschooling kids.  I haven&#39;t read Escape from Childhood in a really long time, but I remember it being pretty radical.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just thought of another one that really grabbed me when I read it about 7 years ago.  It&#39;s called Real Lives- eleven teenagers who don&#39;t go to school by Grace Llewellyn.  I read it when my daughter was 3 and was just amazed at all the possibilities for older kids.<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tWednesday, May 21, 2003 3:23 PM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [Unschooling-dotcom] John Holt books<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book i have is &quot;How Children Learn&quot; by John Holt<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was writing about a child named Lisa.
