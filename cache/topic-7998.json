I had <br/>\nterrible back problems (beginning with my first pregnancy) which I&#39;m <br/>\nsure were made worse by my deliveries.  My DH has been hospitalized <br/>\nfor back pain before and suffers occassional flare ups.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my elder son (who was a very difficult delivery) has asthma, <br/>\nmultiple allergies and sensativities, hyperactivity, tantrums, mood <br/>\nswings, etc and I have been told that many of these things can be <br/>\neased by chiropractic care and exacerbated by long term problems left <br/>\nuntreated.  I once had a &quot;reading&quot; done on his neck/spine at a fair, <br/>\njust for fun.  They told me he would most likely have many problems <br/>\nstemming from his misalignments, which got me thinking more about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked our family physician for a reference to an allergist and a <br/>\nchiropractor (we are new in the state) and was told flatly that he <br/>\n&quot;does not give referrals to chiropractors&quot; and was never contacted <br/>\nwith an allergist reference.  Which is another irritation in a string <br/>\nof dissappointments with this doc, who delivered out second son, and <br/>\nsees all of us as well.  I would have much preferred our family <br/>\npractioner to be an osteopath, but could find none in this small town.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do you chiropractic savvy patients have in the way of advice <br/>\non our situation?  What should I look for in a chiropractor?  What <br/>\nshould services cost me, allowing for regional differences?  Would it <br/>\nbe beneficial to take my three year old to see one for treatment?  <br/>\nEtc... <br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7992,"nextTopicId":8001}}
