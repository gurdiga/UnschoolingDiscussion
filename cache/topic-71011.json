My neighbor grabbed the survivors and put them in a birdcage, but gave them <br/>\nto me when it became obvious that she was allergic to them.  They all <br/>\nsurvived, but were WILD.  They were very frightened, and would bang against the <br/>\n(newer, bigger) cage to get away from anyone who walked by.  We raised them until <br/>\nthey were old enough to survive on their own.  My husband called a ranger at a <br/>\nlocal state park, who was happy to add new blood to the park&#39;s rabbit <br/>\npopulation.  So we dropped them off there.<br/>\n  We missed them, which led us to about ten years of raising domestic <br/>\nrabbits.<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom another letter:<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt; Today, we watched a <br/>\nfamily of morning doves feeding.  There were four babies and they kept <br/>\nfalling off the feeding perch.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last year a couple of doves built a nest on our porch, on a shelf.  They <br/>\nraised two chicks, then another two.  This year (I assume it was the same <br/>\ncouple) they built a new nest.  (My husband threw away the old one right before <br/>\nwinter.)  Although it was officially Spring, it was COLD, and we found two dead <br/>\nbaby birds in the nest, abandoned.  A few weeks later mom was back on the nest, <br/>\nbut no babies (I don&#39;t know what happened this time.)  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll <br/>\nbe back.<br/>\n  <br/>\nMary J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70412,"nextTopicId":70859}}
