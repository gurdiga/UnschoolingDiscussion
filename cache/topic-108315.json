I was in the  <br/>\n&gt;peanut<br/>\n&gt;butter aisle, choosing some (not Jif!  Ha, cultural  reference!).  There <br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;a woman in a service-worker&#39;s uniform (McDonalds or  something) up ahead.  <br/>\n&gt;She<br/>\n&gt;was talking on her cell phone.  I had  my back to her and I wasn&#39;t paying <br/>\n&gt;any<br/>\n&gt;attention to her, choosing pb, but I  could tell she was about to end her<br/>\n&gt;phone call because of what she was saying  that I couldn&#39;t help but hear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I picked up the pb and then turned to walk up the aisle with Will.  In  one<br/>\n&gt;breath the woman on the phone said, &quot;Okay, I love you, Bye!  Is school  out<br/>\n&gt;today?&quot;, as she closed the phone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was taken aback....was she talking to us?  As I squeezed by her  cart, I<br/>\n&gt;looked at her strangely, concluding that she was, indeed now talking to  <br/>\n&gt;us, and<br/>\n&gt;I said, rather curtly, &quot;We don&#39;t believe in school.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Undaunted, she said, &quot;Oh, you must be homeschoolers!&quot; in a rather  <br/>\n&gt;demanding<br/>\n&gt;way, like, &quot;you must engage me in conversation because I&#39;m manic and  can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;help myself.&quot;  By then I was a good 10 feet away from her and  widening the <br/>\n&gt;gap.<br/>\n&gt;  I stopped, turned around, looked her in the eye and  said, &quot;School is for<br/>\n&gt;losers.&quot;, then turned on my heel and walked away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This woman was rude and talking inappropriately to someone she didn&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt;and asking personal questions.  She didn&#39;t have the courtesy to address me  <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;let me know she was addressing me.  Just asked her question like we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;supposed to be in her brain and bend to her wishes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t actually believe school is for losers.  It&#39;s a joke Will and I  <br/>\n&gt;have.<br/>\n&gt;  But I don&#39;t feel the need to be polite to someone so rude and answer  her<br/>\n&gt;questions.  I&#39;d much rather her think I&#39;m crazy than have such a person  <br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m open to speaking with her just because she speaks to me.  If she  had <br/>\n&gt;gone<br/>\n&gt;on, I would have said something less rude and more direct, such as &quot;I&#39;m  <br/>\n&gt;too<br/>\n&gt;busy to talk.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve had experiences with kids who wanted to talk and talk, and I think<br/>\n&gt;there are lots of people who need to learn when enough is enough and when <br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;appropriate to speak, not just kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Karen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDon�t just search.

It may be<br/>\nsimple to many of us, but for many adults, talking to<br/>\na child is very difficult.  My husband can talk with<br/>\nhis own children (or even nephews, nieces, etc.), but<br/>\nif a child comes up that he does not know, he always<br/>\nfeels akward -- he doesn&#39;t not do well with making<br/>\nconversation with them, and even if he just needs to<br/>\ngive a one sentence response, it&#39;s still hard for him.<br/>\n He would much rather talk to an adult (but he is<br/>\nstill a bit shy with adults too).<br/>\n<br/>\nI, on the other hand, feel extremely comofortable<br/>\ntalking to just about any child.  Any age child can<br/>\nwalk up to me and I feel that I am friendly and<br/>\nresponsive to them -- I ask questions (if appropriate)<br/>\nand listen to them. I&#39;ve often had child see me again<br/>\n-- at the park, at the store, wherever -- and remember<br/>\nme and be excited to see me.  I can talk to children<br/>\nmuch easier than I can with adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t think it is okay for adults to be rude to<br/>\na child.  No matter how akward it is for my husband,<br/>\nhe isn&#39;t rude in my opinion, but it is in the eye<br/>\n(ear?) of the beholder, so maybe he does appear rude<br/>\nto the parents of these children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandie <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tableforfive.blogspot.com\">http://tableforfive.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com\">http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

Have they been watching them and smiling at them?   <br/>\nInviting interaction with non-verbal clues?   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a park, if someone says &quot;Nice bike!&quot; that&#39;s a possible moment for a return <br/>\ncomment.   If someone is reading a newspaper or a book, that is NOT a good <br/>\nperson to start up a chat with.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a case in which it wouldn&#39;t be cool for an adult to start a conversation <br/>\nwith another person, it&#39;s not okay for a child to either.     Even if all <br/>\nadults did see adults and children equally (which we know they don&#39;t), it&#39;s not <br/>\nokay for adults to &quot;love to talk to adults&quot; in a non-discriminate way.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day Keith and I were going for a walk, and a police car stopped <br/>\nright by us and the guy got out, right by a bike path that goes along a drainage <br/>\nditch by our house.   We didn&#39;t know he wasn&#39;t wanting to talk to us, but it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t likely.   He was going to talk to a homeless guy who was up on the side <br/>\nof the ditch against someone&#39;s back wall.   He knew his name and all.   Keith <br/>\nand I were just happening to be there.   That was really NOT a good time to go <br/>\nand get into the conversation.   We did   greet the policeman and he made a <br/>\nfriendly comment of some sort and then went to talk to the guy.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWould a child know that was a bad time to ask questions?   Would a child know <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t a good time to say &quot;I&#39;m Sandra and this is my dog Gudrun?&quot;   (We <br/>\ndid have Gudrun with us, and she wasn&#39;t on a leash, but nobody in the situation <br/>\ncared.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just rambling, I think; sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly has gone to visit other houses and there&#39;s not a set time to come <br/>\nhome, I&#39;ve coached her to watch for clues that they&#39;re planning to do <br/>\nsomething else as a family, or fixing dinner or something, and come home then, when <br/>\nthe climate seems to change.   She was good at that.   Some people are better at <br/>\nit than others.
