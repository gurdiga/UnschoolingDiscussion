Elkins (Randolph) allows children to <br/>\ncome part time to school, and if the child enters high school partway through <br/>\nthey will give credit for homeschooling done.  Other counties (like Upshur, <br/>\nLewis, etc) won&#39;t let children attend sport or music programs, and will give no <br/>\ncredit for any schooling done at home.  Also, in WV if you are not in school <br/>\n(or officially homeschooling) you cannot get your driver&#39;s license until you are <br/>\n18.  So, it&#39;s not an option to quit the evaluations when the child reaches <br/>\n16, or their driver&#39;s license will not be renewable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always done the portfolio evaluations, and it&#39;s something the kids <br/>\nactually enjoy doing....putting together almost a scrapbook of all the stuff <br/>\nthey&#39;ve done all year.  We know of 2 licensed teachers who are very friendly to <br/>\nhomeschoolers/unschoolers and the evaluations are not problem, no pressure.  <br/>\nOne portfolio evaluator we used was licensed in the states of Louisiana and <br/>\nOhio, and was working on getting her WV certificate.  Our school board had no <br/>\nproblem but another county&#39;s superintendant had a problem with another evaluation <br/>\ndone by her.  It just depends a lot on where you live.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS a WONDERFUL place to live, and unschool, especially if nature and the <br/>\noutdoors is a big part of your life.  Sort of harder if you&#39;re the symphony, <br/>\nmuseum, theater type of family.  Not a whole lot of those here in Central WV.  <br/>\nBut if you love appalachian culture, music, folklore, dance, and life, it&#39;s <br/>\nheaven.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: West Virginia questions","postDate":"1079198221","msgId":91875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEOTRENDVDLTc1MTItMTFEOC1BQjgyLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMydmNpbytuanIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMydmNpbytuanIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91870,"nextInTopic":91923,"prevInTime":91874,"nextInTime":91876,"topicId":91787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We&#39;ve always tested thru WVHEA because that <br/>\nhas seemed the least invasive to me, and my boys don&#39;t mind them and <br/>\ndo reasonably well on the tests. You can also test in the ps for <br/>\ncertain grades, but my bet is no unschoolers do this. Many <br/>\nunschoolers here assess via portfolio evaluation, meaning the family <br/>\nassembles a selection of the child&#39;s work, selecting items to <br/>\ninclude that will show progress in the 5 subject areas the law <br/>\nmentions and indicate what the child has been doing throughout the <br/>\nyear (include brochures from places visited, listing of videos <br/>\nwatched, websites visited, etc). (We just printed an article on <br/>\nportfolios in the latest WVHEA newsletter, but haven&#39;t got it up on <br/>\nthe website yet.) The portfolio is evaluated by a certified teacher. <br/>\nSelecting the teacher is very important, as you can imagine. <br/>\nPersonally I know of only one teacher, a homeschool consultant, who <br/>\ndoes evaluations and is unschooler friendly, but I have heard of a <br/>\nfew others who understand unschooling. If I ever decide to do a <br/>\nportfolio (we might this year for my younger son), I will use her; <br/>\nshe&#39;s become a friend. The 4th assessment option is alternative <br/>\nassessment; you and your county BOE agree on a way to evaluate your <br/>\nchildren. I don&#39;t know of any unschoolers who have used this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat pretty much covers the legal bits that might seem like hurdles <br/>\nto any new hser, unschooler or not. I&#39;m not sure what area you&#39;re <br/>\nin, but I do see an ad for meer.net on 79 so i&#39;m guessing you might <br/>\nbe in the Fairmont area. We live SW of Clarksburg, but we found a <br/>\ngroup of  relaxed unschoolers in the Fairmont area so that&#39;s where <br/>\nwe go once a week. The kids&#39; ages range from 13 (almost 14) to <br/>\ninfant. There&#39;s usually a balance of organized/planned activities <br/>\nwith unstructured stuff. The site isn&#39;t the best but they&#39;re working <br/>\non finding a better spot. If you are in the area and are curious to <br/>\nmeet other homeschoolers/unschoolers, please let me know and I&#39;ll <br/>\ngive directions. If you&#39;re closer to Morgantown, there is a really <br/>\ngreat group up there, Monongalia Area Homeschoolers Assn. People <br/>\nfrom Fairmont, Preston County and even we have gone to some of their <br/>\nactivities. You should check out the support group listings at <br/>\nwww.wvhea.org. This also has info about the law and a bit about how <br/>\nto deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should add that I wish I had considered NC more carefully before <br/>\nwe moved here from VA a few years ago. I understand that in NC while <br/>\nyou have to test annually, you don&#39;t report the scores. That&#39;s what <br/>\nmy friend in NC (met her after we moved) told me anyway. So whatever <br/>\nlegal threat testing might pose to a NC unschooler seems to be <br/>\nwithout teeth. RE: other states in the area: I am told that WV&#39;s law <br/>\nwas pretty much copied from OH&#39;s. PA&#39;s law is burdensome but I have <br/>\nheard that there are unschoolers living quite happily there (well, <br/>\nas happy as anyone can be with PA&#39;s hsing laws). I found VA fairly <br/>\neasy to hs in; there are plenty of unschoolers there. The MD <br/>\nunschoolers I know use an umbrella school. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know <br/>\nmuch of anything about Kentucky. NHEN (www.nhen.org) should have <br/>\ninfo about its regs and ways to find other hsers there. Also, Ann <br/>\nZeise&#39;s site is good for comparing regs in the various states.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":131271049,"authorName":"Susan Gallien","from":"&quot;Susan Gallien&quot; &lt;susan@...&gt;","profile":"susanmarguerite","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] West Virginia questions","postDate":"1079097059","msgId":91808,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTIwMWM0MDgzMyQ3N2U1N2ZlMCQzYmU5YjI0MUBTVUU+","referencesHeader":"PDY3LjIzYmVkZmM1LjJkODI5MTVjQGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDI2MDFjNDA4MmIkOTcwNjEyNzAkM2E3Nzg0NDVAdGhlOW9mdXM+"},"prevInTopic":91805,"nextInTopic":91868,"prevInTime":91807,"nextInTime":91809,"topicId":91787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Where did you find the online computer test?
