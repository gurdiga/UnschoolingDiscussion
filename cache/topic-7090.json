But just because a child looks at food (however longingly)<br/>\ndoes not mean they are truely ready for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose were good points about readiness. The child should be able to sit<br/>\nup, hold their head up, and should be reaching for the food and able to<br/>\nfeed themselves. That doesn&#39;t mean they need to be able to use utensils,<br/>\nbut if they have to be spoonfed every bite, then they are probably not<br/>\nready. And if you spoonfeed them and they spit it out and turn their<br/>\nheads, this is not a good photo op. This is a sign to stop! Many, many<br/>\nparents think they have to teach the child to eat and keep shoveling it<br/>\nin. As with unschooling :-) if they are ready, they don&#39;t have to be<br/>\n&quot;taught&quot;. I started dd on solids at 6 m/o. She did not spit out and<br/>\nloved every bite. However, at 7 m/o she began reaching for food and<br/>\nfeeding herself. In hindsight, I think this is when she was truely ready<br/>\n(I know better for next time :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for children who &quot;need&quot; solids? Well no, they cannot live on<br/>\nbreastmilk forever. But at this young an age (up to well into the second<br/>\nyear for some babies) they do not need solids. Breastmilk has everything<br/>\nthey need - including fat for growth. It is very unlikely that a very<br/>\nyoung baby would &quot;need&quot; solids. Perhaps if the breastfeeding<br/>\nrelationship is not healthy. If they are not nursing enuf or if the mom<br/>\ndoes not have a good supply (which is extremely rare but does happen).<br/>\nBut if the breastfeeding relationship is healthy, there is no need for a<br/>\nfour month old baby to have solids. I do not mean to offend anyone who<br/>\nbelieves their young infant did need solids this early, but before<br/>\nsomeone starts their 4 m/o on solids I believe they should look into why<br/>\nand if it&#39;s necessary. Don&#39;t just listen to your MIL or your well<br/>\nmeaning ped (the one who had all of 1 hour of bf classes in med school)<br/>\n:-) Do some research. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlot of babies go thru growth spurts and slow growth periods too. It&#39;s<br/>\nmost common to slow down on growth around 6 m/o, but different babies<br/>\nare different and can slow down earlier or later. My dd has been a slow<br/>\ngrower since she was born. She grows steadily, but<br/>\ns...l...o...w...l...y. I was very fortunate in that our ped was a good<br/>\none. I was never told to suplement with formula as some of my friends<br/>\nwere. She is healthy, active, and bright. She&#39;s just small. But often<br/>\npeople will take slow growth as a sign to supplement with formula or<br/>\nsolids. If the breastfeeding relationship is a healthy one and the baby<br/>\nis thriving (healthy, active, meeting milestones, gaining, however<br/>\nslowly) then this is not necessary. All babies are different! Some are<br/>\npetite little things like my dd, some are big bruisers. We&#39;re not all<br/>\nmade from the same mold. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a lot of people erroneously believe they have a low supply or that<br/>\nthe child &quot;needs more than breastmilk&quot; because the baby nurses &quot;too<br/>\noften&quot;. There is no such thing as nursing too often. In some &quot;less<br/>\ncivilized&quot; cultures babies are worn and have 24/7 access to the breast<br/>\nand often nurse every 15 minutes or so! Of course, in these cultures<br/>\nthey do not have peds telling them that the child needs solids or needs<br/>\nto be on a schedule. They recognize that it is normal for a baby to eat<br/>\nthis often. In our society, we don&#39;t have it as &quot;easy&quot;. We have more<br/>\nbelongings. More things to clean (and more emphasis on keeping our stuff<br/>\nclean). We have jobs. We have television shows we just can&#39;t miss. We<br/>\nhave visitors who want to hold the baby. All of these things and more<br/>\nconspire to make us want easier, more convenient babies. And nursing<br/>\nevery 15 minutes is not convenient. Basically, it&#39;s not the baby who has<br/>\nthe &quot;problem&quot;. It&#39;s us, the parents. Nature prepares a baby for one way<br/>\nof life. Society demands another. <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting off my fanatical breastfeeding soapbox now. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, if your child does not have allergies or stomach problems,<br/>\nthen no, starting them on solids early is not going to cause problems<br/>\n(after that whole thing, I bet you didn&#39;t expect me to say that, did<br/>\nyou? :-) It is the ideal to not start them on solids til they are ready,<br/>\nbut while stuffing solids in before they are ready *can* cause problems<br/>\n(often allergies are discovered and exacerbated this way), it *usually*<br/>\ndoes not.

Other signs to watch for readiness would be ability to<br/>\nsit up on their own and hold their own food (ie you don&#39;t feed them, they<br/>\nshould be able to grasp the food and feed themselves.  When you are<br/>\nready to feed her solids try real food, meaning mashed avocados (my<br/>\nbabies and kids love avocados) bananas, knawing on carrots before<br/>\ntheir teeth come in, stuff like that.

I know it can be frustrating<br/>\nhaving an infant that&#39;s hungry all the time, but she&#39;s still sooooo young.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that starting solids too soon can have many<br/>\nundesirable  effects, including allergic reactions, tummy troubles, etc. The<br/>\nfact that she&#39;s so big already suggests that she&#39;s getting all she needs<br/>\nfrom breastmilk. Starting solids now could also hinder your nursing<br/>\nrelationship. Don&#39;t forget, the introduction to solids is the first step to<br/>\nweaning. You could consult LLL&#39;s womanly art of Breastfeeding for more<br/>\nsuggestions. Also, just an FYI coconuts can be a highly allergic food, so<br/>\nI&#39;d definatly forego the milk idea.
