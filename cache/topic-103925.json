They had  their first <br/>\ntest, and he got a 92.  I asked him if that was an A or a B by  their grading <br/>\nscale, and he said they didn&#39;t give him a letter, just a number.  &lt;g&gt;  I let <br/>\nit go and didn&#39;t tell them there are always letters behind  those numbers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nHe has math again today.  I asked him last night whether he had  finished his <br/>\nhomework, and he said he had.    Since he started  taking classes his <br/>\nhomework has always been done early.  When I was in  school, mine was NEVER done <br/>\nearly.  I&#39;ve written papers the morning they  were due and gotten Bs.  But even <br/>\nhis ill-fated English essay was done a  day and a half before it was due.  I&#39;m <br/>\nimpressed but I don&#39;t want to make a  big deal with him about it because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want him to know it&#39;s unusual, for  one thing.  It would seem that I was <br/>\nkind of encouraging him to slack and  stall.   Maybe he&#39;s doing it early because <br/>\nhe&#39;s also taking a class in  college success.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI did want to pass on my outside observations, though.  He&#39;s not  telling me <br/>\nas many stories about what happens now that it&#39;s not so new to him,  but he <br/>\ndid tell us about the 92 on the test, and he&#39;s planning to take more  classes.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103922,"nextTopicId":103934}}
