What should be in it that kind of<br/>\n&gt; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Donna.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I like to tell moms about report writing is that the work <br/>\nought to be in this ratio: 90% research and 10% writing. The only <br/>\nreason schools ask kids to write reports is to teach them library <br/>\nand reasearch skills. Really. If they were interested in the kids <br/>\nlearning content, then they would assign the content (in junior <br/>\nhigh, they sometimes do, but in elementary school they almost <br/>\nnever do). But usually the elementary school report is about a <br/>\nfavorite planet, state, historical figure or movie star. &lt;g&gt; The <br/>\ncontent isn&#39;t the primary focus. It&#39;s an opportunity to learn how to <br/>\nuse a card catalog, find books, read and summarize info and put <br/>\nit together in an attractive format.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids or moms want to do school-style reports, I suggest <br/>\nfocusing on the fun aspects of research. Call places for <br/>\nbrochures or flyers or books. Use email and the Internet top <br/>\ncollect data. Keep notes on file cards and sort them by topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrganize your report by identifying the four or five main areas to <br/>\nresearch and report. Give the report a voice/focus. Will she write <br/>\nfrom the biographical perspective or from the perspective of how <br/>\nthe historical peson fit into a historical time period? Will she <br/>\nwrite about a state as a travel advisor or as someone interested <br/>\nin buisness and commerce?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, the writing of the report ought to be the least <br/>\nemphasized aspect of the experience. And here&#39;s one very good <br/>\nreason why (one that is overlooked in schools). Report writing is <br/>\nnotoriously bad writing. Oh, it may be grammatically correct and <br/>\norganized well, but it is usually as dull as a doormat to read. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to train our children to think that writing is meant to put <br/>\npeople to sleep. Writing is meant to enliven the reader! Reports <br/>\nalmost never do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn keeping with the goal of lots of research and minimal writing, I <br/>\nsuggest a couple ways to spruce up the writing side of report <br/>\nwriting. Start with an anecdote, if at all possible. If your child is <br/>\nwriting about the state of Michigan and has a grandparent there, <br/>\nshare a brief memory of visiting the state. If the child is writing <br/>\nabout Pluto, start the report with the most mysterious, surprising <br/>\nfacts he or she uncovered. If writing about a historical figure, start <br/>\nwith a little known story that leads the reader to discover (to her <br/>\nsurprise) that this report is about ________.<br/>\n<br/>\nWork on an opening hook to relieve the report of the dull tone it <br/>\nwill inevitably take. Use subheads so that you can organize the <br/>\nmaterial. And only ask your child to write about the aspects of the <br/>\ntopic that keenly interest her. (No need to include the <br/>\nprecipitation measurements if weather doesn&#39;t impress her.) But <br/>\nbe sure to include which famous musicians or movie stars live <br/>\nin Michigan or what cartoon characters were named after that <br/>\nplanet and why!<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: I think the school report is totally unnecessary for <br/>\nkids who spend a load of time at the library placing books on <br/>\nhold, who can locate whatever they need in an encyclopedia or <br/>\nmagazine and who read voraciously on any topic of interest. I&#39;d <br/>\nrather put my &quot;teachihng writing&quot; efforts toward writing that zings! <br/>\nWriting that speaks and lives and enhances the reader&#39;s <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Bogart (Shall I go by Julie B?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve included my business website below.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bravewriter.com\">http://www.bravewriter.com</a>  <br/>\n(If you are interested in some free writing exercises and articles <br/>\nthat help you think through writing from a natural perspective)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53757,"nextTopicId":53764}}
