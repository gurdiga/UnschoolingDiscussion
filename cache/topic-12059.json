I was desperately in search of someone to care for <br/>\nme.   I can see that now, but then I was sure I was in love forever, <br/>\nfortunately my love was a good person.   However he wasn&#39;t really <br/>\nthe right person for me, we were married for 26 years and had 9 <br/>\nchildren, he is a good person, just not for me, we are too different <br/>\nin our values.   At first the children held us together, but eventually <br/>\nthey drove us apart, our different attitudes to child rearing and a few <br/>\nother issues.   I can not for a second regret those 26 years, my <br/>\nchildren are wonderful people who I love dearly, however my life <br/>\nwould have been better if I had the belief in myself that I was a <br/>\nlovable person and that it would be better to wait and find someone <br/>\nwho I had more in comon with, where we wanted to live, our <br/>\nthoughts on child rearing, our thoughts on school, government etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn raising strong confident daughters who know they are loved and <br/>\nvalued we give them a better chance at a good life.... my oldest is <br/>\na carreer woman who when she turns 25 soon will have been <br/>\nworking for 10 years, she quit school and got a job the second she <br/>\ncould as she believed that she was wasting her time in school.  <br/>\nI always let her know that she could do anything that she put her <br/>\nmind to and that her education etc were her descision.   I hope I <br/>\nam able to do as well with the little ones, from my outspoken <br/>\nalmost 12 year old I think I am on the right track with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sue   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\nMy website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\nFarm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\nFarm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, <br/>\n is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"C7MDOVO9wS9MnOgYE7t1YgvGHvCOtv532YAUBYR-dgsq9dYUfTMfrIy-tds9QOYDOTlUJBm3TF4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Our Bodies - what happens to a girl","postDate":"966605784","msgId":12059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwLjI0MjM4MWQuMjZjZTk1ZDhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12075,"prevInTime":12058,"nextInTime":12060,"topicId":12059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1958466803\">&lt;&lt;Instead of focusing on abortion as having been the answer, <br/>\nperhaps the focus should be on preventing pregnancy in the first place. <br/>\nClearly, that woman had major problems.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me this is the crux of the problem... I can only talk about America and <br/>\nEngland, two countries I&#39;ve grown up in and as long as girls/women are <br/>\nsexualized and encouraged to look for men as the answer to anything and <br/>\neverything and pregnancy as a means of escape.. I believe abortion, abuse etc <br/>\nis going to continue.  So it starts with the parents... As I have seen there <br/>\nare many parents who are just not involved with their kids and these would be <br/>\nconsidered &quot;good parents&quot;... They have a baby in a two parent family, 6 weeks <br/>\nafter birth the mother goes back to work (doesn&#39;t matter which one does it) <br/>\nand puts the baby in daycare from 6:30am-6pm 5 days a week... No bonding with <br/>\nmother or father... But they make lots of money and isnt&#39; that more <br/>\nimportant? (joke).. So then the child doesn&#39;t havea connection with either of <br/>\nthe parents really, maybe a superficial one, and then off the go to public <br/>\nschool where they get sucked into the crowd and find a niche with other girls <br/>\nthat have been through a similar disconnected experience with their parents.  <br/>\nThese girls are all looking for someone to love them and need them and want <br/>\nthem... In all of this the media and society in general is telling them how <br/>\nto look (thin and beautiful) and how to act (being in love with a boy is the <br/>\nonly way to be).  So it&#39;s not surprising when at 15 years old they end up <br/>\npregnant... Because of their real disconnection with anything outside <br/>\nthemselves, it&#39;s easy to see how it&#39;s very easy for them to flush a baby down <br/>\nthe toilet, whether that&#39;s through abortion or actually having the baby and <br/>\nkilling it.  It makes complete logical sense given their upbringing... <br/>\nAlternatively they wait until they are 18, get married to some looser <br/>\n(because who would have taught them what a good man, husband looks like, if <br/>\ntheir parents are not available) and then get pregnant, only to find out that <br/>\nhaving a baby is the toughest thing that will every happen and a much harder <br/>\njob than going to a 9-5 outside job.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion of a scenario that&#39;s happening all over the westernized <br/>\nworld.
