Today we did pointillism,<br/>\nlike Seurat if you&#39;re familiar with him, only we used<br/>\npussywillows for making the dots. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt worked great, by the way; some of you might want to<br/>\ntry it with your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, one kid discovered he could make dots with the<br/>\ntips of his fingers, and soon everyone was<br/>\nfingerpainting. Aubrey did two fingerpaintings, one<br/>\nred and pink with graceful swirls and one green and<br/>\nbrown with aggressive slashes. I said, &quot;This first one<br/>\nlooks like one of your good moods and the green one<br/>\nlooks like one of your bad moods.&quot; This was ok to say<br/>\nat the time, because we&#39;d talked about it a lot today.<br/>\nShe thought a minute, then said she thought they both<br/>\nlooked like good moods. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I was helping some tiny tots wash up, and next<br/>\nthing I knew, Aubrey brought me a picture she&#39;d made<br/>\nof a BAD mood.
