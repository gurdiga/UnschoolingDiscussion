Megan signed up for nature walks<br/>\nand a Spanish for non-reader class.  We leave at 9:30 and get back about<br/>\n4.  They play with friends some of the time too - between the classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the other days don&#39;t follow any pattern.  This week my daughter <br/>\ndecided that we were having a mushroom party on Tu. so she made a lot<br/>\nof mushroom shaped pictures, a picture of a mushroom princess.  We also<br/>\nwent walking outside to see what types we could find.  The past few<br/>\ndays we&#39;ve been doing lots of Lego (math), reading and artwork.  On Momday<br/>\nI copied some pages out of books for them - things I knew they&#39;d like.<br/>\nSo we have dot-to-dot dinosaur pages and mazes all over the living room<br/>\nfloor now.

Around here, they learn a bit about <br/>\ntheir communities.  Homeschoolers learn that just by being out of school <br/>\nand going out into the community with their parents.  They learn to play <br/>\nwith other kids.  That&#39;s not too hard to provide, either through <br/>\nhomeschooling groups (large or small) or with after school classes.  And <br/>\nthey learn something about letters and numbers.  Kids that age are so <br/>\nnaturally curious about letters and numbers.  If they aren&#39;t curious yet, <br/>\nit&#39;s probably either because they aren&#39;t ready or there aren&#39;t very many <br/>\nletters or numbers in their environment.  Both are easy to fix, the first, <br/>\nby waiting, the second by changing the environment so that it includes more <br/>\nof them.  (Lots of books, counting things, refrigerator letters, books <br/>\nlying around, alphabet posters, figuring out how many plates and cups to <br/>\nput on the table)  There are tons of things you can do to encourage <br/>\nexploration of these things without using curriculum.

Too many people believe that you <br/>\nhave to learn the same things the same way as everyone else.  Once <br/>\nyou are past that idea, it gets much easier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReally, look at the problems in today&#39;s public schools . . . <br/>\neverything is geared (and becoming moreso) toward uniformity.  Every <br/>\nkid is supposed to do the same things at the same time in the same <br/>\nway.  That concept is a lot of cause of the demise of our public <br/>\nschool system.  If your child is not dead average in every subject, <br/>\nschools are not going to be what works best for them.
