Are you worried that your child will take drugs or drink? Wont be able to stand up to peer pressure?<br/>\nMaybe talking it through with your child would be a good thing. Personally I think most kids will try  a bit of drink or smoke a little dope whether their parents approve or not. To me its part of growing up.
