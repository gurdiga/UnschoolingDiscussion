He doesn&#39;t have ONE friend from <br/>\nschool anymore and often tells me how much he hated school...how he joined <br/>\nco-op to avoid it.  Occasionaly I may hear how she needs to be able to be a <br/>\ncheerleader or join band or just have 800 kids to choose friends from.  Last <br/>\nnight it was the &#39;on level&#39; thing.  Those arguements aren&#39;t even worth <br/>\nstarting because he won&#39;t even listen to HER when she says she isn&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in those things!  Cheerleading is the last interest on her list <br/>\nand she is a self taught guitar player...not even possible in ps here <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I were raised in abusive homes.  We saw and were exposed to <br/>\njust about all of it.  I came out wanting nothing remotely like that for my <br/>\nchildren, he came out feeling like there&#39;s always someone worse off.  I <br/>\ndigress...<br/>\n<br/>\nUsusally, I am able to appease his *concerns* (sorry if the emphasis of that <br/>\nwas rude) by nodding my head and keeping quiet, but now that she is getting <br/>\nolder and finding her niche in different areas (she loves skateboarding and <br/>\npunk music) he thinks she needs to be in the masses.  I keep my eyes wide <br/>\nopen and censor, which he also thinks is rediculous.  He thinks she is smart <br/>\nenough to avoid or ignore bad things, I, on the other hand feel as if she is <br/>\nconstantly exposed, she will become desensitized and find it easier to go <br/>\nwith the crowd.  She has always been a silent leader in negative situations, <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t join in, but she won&#39;t leave or speak out either, which concerns <br/>\nme.  I feel like we are still in the stage of laying down our morals and <br/>\nbeliefs and I see my cousins, who are in ps, being sooo influenced by their <br/>\npeers.  In a homeschool setting, I am able to monitor situations more <br/>\nclosely and gently offer my guidance without being overbearing or nosy.  <br/>\nFrom what I have experienced myself, and seen in others, it is near <br/>\nimpossible to do that when your child is away 9 hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well you&#39;ve probably heard here about my son who only learned to read &gt;when<br/>\n&gt;he was 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I actually just joined the group last night, so I hadn&#39;t read this yet, but <br/>\nI have heard similar stories and it does help to ease my anxiety and fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I asked a teacher once how many kids in the average grade 4 class &gt;(what my<br/>\n&gt;son would have been in at the time if he went to school) were at grade <br/>\n&gt; &gt;level<br/>\n&gt;in all subjects.

Just goes to show that the *system* isn&#39;t always right.  <br/>\nI suppose I knew this, but it is so easy to forget.  I come from a family <br/>\nwith many teachers and the pressure can really be overwhelming at times.  I <br/>\nmuster up all my strength and hold my head high because I also hear my <br/>\nfamily tell me how well behaved my children are, how much they love to <br/>\nlearn, etc.  My grandmother came by Thursday to go with us to park day with <br/>\nour local support group.  It was raining and no one was there, so she asked <br/>\nthe kids if they wanted to go to McD&#39;s and play inside.  Not one did.  THey <br/>\nwanted to go to the book store instead.  She said she&#39;d never heard a child <br/>\n(much less 6..little one is too young to speak up) refuse McDonalds play for <br/>\na book!

On one<br/>\nlist, somebody posted that they had decided their kids need socialization so<br/>\nthey took them into the bathroom once a week and beat them up for their<br/>\nlunch money.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nSeriously, he probably hasn&#39;t thought about what he means by peer<br/>\nrelationships.  (I&#39;m assuming your daughter has at least *some* peer<br/>\nrelationships.)  People mean such different things when they ask about<br/>\nsocialization.  To some it means learning to follow rules, which<br/>\nhomeschoolers also do.  To some it means having friendships, which<br/>\nhomeschoolers also do.  To some it means learning to sit down, shut up, and<br/>\ndo what you&#39;re told without thinking.  I doubt this is what your husband<br/>\nwants for her, but she *would* learn it (or learn to completely rebel<br/>\nagainst it) in school.  You might also ask him how many friends he&#39;s still<br/>\nin touch with from high school.

I am doing some contract work right now <br/>\nfor an educational testing company, scoring proficiency tests for <br/>\ndifferent states.  What an eye opener!  Lately we&#39;ve been doing 8th <br/>\nand 10th grade tests.  If you think your child is not on &quot;grade <br/>\nlevel&quot; you should see what I am seeing, every day, about 900 to 1500 <br/>\ntimes a day, from all over the country.  There are very, very few who <br/>\nactually are working up to the level set out by institutionalized <br/>\nlearning &quot;experts.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just what does that mean anyway?  The rubrics that we must use to <br/>\nscore many of these questions actually punish the creative or out-of-<br/>\nthe-box thinker.  Bill Gates or Einstein would not have done well on <br/>\nmany parts of these tests.  Time and again we lowly test-scorers ask <br/>\nwhy we have to score a zero for a kid when we can clearly see that <br/>\nthis child&#39;s answer is well-written, logical, appropriate, but does <br/>\nnot fit the pre-determined rubric set by the person who wrote the <br/>\nquestion and the committee he or she used to refine the rubric for <br/>\nexactly what they want the child to answer, not what might be an <br/>\nequally good response.  No leeway.  The test scorers are constantly <br/>\nbeing tested themselves and called on the carpet for any variation <br/>\nfrom the percentages that the test designers want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not allowed to say much more due to contractual secrecy, but you <br/>\nwill find much of the same type of information in the book, THE BIG <br/>\nTEST: THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN MERITOCRACY by Nicholas <br/>\nLemann. Here&#39;s a web site where you can read more about this book <br/>\n(read an excerpt, reviews, even take a test): <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.the-big-test.com/\">http://www.the-big-test.com/</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I read this book I chose to accept a temporary contract job in <br/>\nthis field. I&#39;m a true unschooler myself, wanting to learn hands-on <br/>\nwhenever possible.  Wanted to see from the inside what was really <br/>\ngoing on, since so many put so much credence in testing.  Believe me, <br/>\nmy eyes have been opened. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important eye-opener was what I experienced while training <br/>\nfor this job.  We have to learn these rubrics and are tested, over <br/>\nand over again, to be sure we have learned them the way the state <br/>\nwants them learned.  I quickly felt the elation that comes with a 90% <br/>\nor 100% score on these tests.  I was thoroughly programmed for this <br/>\nand surprised that it never leaves you once the programming takes, no <br/>\nmatter how much we intellectually disagree with it.  And then came <br/>\nthe depression, self-doubt and loss of self-confidence that comes <br/>\nwhen I found myself scoring 40%, 50% or 60% on some of these <br/>\nrubrics.  I quickly realized that if this could happen to me in less <br/>\nthan one hour, then think of the cumulative impact it must have on <br/>\nall the poor kids who are forced to do this, who spend every day and <br/>\nevery week being &quot;graded,&quot; being told how good they are, or how bad <br/>\nthey are, at everything they do.  This is the real poison of all <br/>\ntesting and of setting up parameters for &quot;grade level work.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice:  stay away from anything that tries to put your child in a <br/>\nbox.

I <br/>\nknow quite a few kids who have gone to high school after unschooling <br/>\nfor all their younger years. They have varied reasons for it. Most are <br/>\nkids whose parents thought they were &quot;behind&quot; grade level. Sometimes <br/>\nthe first year - they weren&#39;t ready for the most advanced stuff. But, <br/>\nwhen kids enter high school - there is lots of variation in kids&#39; <br/>\nabilities - little retention - and they teach the same stuff over that <br/>\nthe kids had already been taught in earlier grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are sometimes some funny things that the previously-unschooled <br/>\nkids don&#39;t &#39;get&quot; at first - but they catch on very quickly. For <br/>\nexample, one kid I know had to do a paper for her combination <br/>\nhistory/english class - it was to be a diary entry as if she was a girl <br/>\ntraveling in a wagon train. They couldn&#39;t type it because &quot;they didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave typewriters then.&quot; She turned her paper in and the teacher <br/>\nreturned it because it was not stapled - she was told to staple it and <br/>\nturn it in the next day (marked down for being one day late). The girl <br/>\nsaid, &quot;But they didn&#39;t have staples then,&quot; and got marked down extra <br/>\nfor insubordination. The hardest thing about going to school, for these <br/>\nkids, is that kind of nonsense and not being able to speak directly to <br/>\nadults without it being called insubordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"sevenhavei","from":"&quot;sevenhavei&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"concerns, doubts, questioning myself","postDate":"1049613953","msgId":63053,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2b2txMStoMGdsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":63055,"prevInTime":63052,"nextInTime":63054,"topicId":63053,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve been unschooling with curriculum for four years.

(My oldest <br/>\njust turned 12 and has been home since the end of second grade in <br/>\nps.)  We have the books, etc. and she is free to use or not use them <br/>\nas she desires.  There are times when she pours through them for <br/>\ndays then she may drop them for months only to pour through them <br/>\nagain, etc.  As with any child, adult, human, etc....she has <br/>\nstrenghts and weaknesses, for lack of a better term.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been quite confident in her and myself for the past few <br/>\nyears, but now, for some reason, I find my fears and doubts <br/>\nswallowing me.  My husband is pushing for her to return to ps, which <br/>\nhas her mind racing with the idea.  She rarely brings up returning, <br/>\nbut when she does, I find myself nervous.  She is extremely mature, <br/>\nresponsible and bright, however she is behind in certain areas, as <br/>\nfar as ps standards go.  Just in the past six months, I have watched <br/>\nher flourish as a writer, take responsibility for and set her own <br/>\ndaily rhythm and become quite a young lady.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs the oldest of seven, with the next in line being 5 years younger, <br/>\nshe has struggled with her relationship with her siblings, often <br/>\nfeeling left out because they are all so young.  With the birth of <br/>\nour last child 6 months ago, to whom she has a strong bond, she has <br/>\nblossomed as the big sister....I often catch her reading them books, <br/>\nteaching them to read or count...or just loving them in the sweetest <br/>\nof ways.  When most children her age are heading into the often <br/>\ndreaded teen years, our daughter has become an absolute pleasure to <br/>\nbe around.  It pains me to think of losing these daily moments with <br/>\nher.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I am not facing the struggle of letting her go to ps, <br/>\nbut the older she gets, the more leary my husband becomes of <br/>\nhomeschooling.  He is fine with the elementary years but thinks the <br/>\npeer relationships of ps are so important...no matter how I explain <br/>\nmy views, he butts heads with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure where I am going with this and apologize for the <br/>\nlength.  I guess I am looking for reassurance or direction?  It is <br/>\nso easy to relax when they are ahead and flying, but I don&#39;t often <br/>\nhear about those who fall behind here or there.  I&#39;ve been online <br/>\nall night trying to find some gem of information but I am coming up <br/>\nemtpy.  I suppose my biggest fear is the day she really does want to <br/>\ngo back to ps (if that day comes) and the thought of having to tell <br/>\nher she isn&#39;t on grade level in some areas and in others she would <br/>\nface the possibility of boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm Wishes,<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63223,"nextTopicId":63139}}
