Add to that the fact that<br/>\nat age 18 the children become &quot;aged out&quot; of the<br/>\nsystem, even if they are still in public school, and<br/>\nare not allowed any further assistance.

You&#39;re taking on a lot here, aren&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter just turned 14. 12 wasn&#39;t easy. I&#39;m trying to put together a lot <br/>\nof stuff in my head and come out with what would most help Katie feel like a <br/>\nvaluable, worthy, lovable person. Can you show her how much it means to you <br/>\nto have another woman/girl in your family? Will she have her own space to <br/>\nretreat to when she needs that? My daughter was so uncertain of herself at <br/>\nthis age, wanting to hang onto being a little girl, but getting the message <br/>\nfrom society/culture/her own body that she was becoming a woman. Frightened, <br/>\nbut not wanting to show fear. She needed more stuffed animals and dolls at <br/>\nthis time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know that she has already started her period.....how do you deal with a <br/>\n pre-teenage girl to make sure she uses proper hygiene? She just turned 12 in <br/>\n March. Can you give a 12yo girl Midol? What types of things do girls like to <br/>\n do? Basically...what should I do with her that I do not with the boys <br/>\nbecause <br/>\n of A) her situation and B) her gender???? I am clueless when it comes to <br/>\n girls. Any and all help will be much appreciated. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. Hmm. We let preconceived ideas about &quot;proper hygiene&quot; relax. Because my <br/>\ndaughter was so sensitive to anything that seemed like criticism at this age, <br/>\nI would try more for having things available for her to use. For me being <br/>\navailable if she had questions. Instruction and advice were tricky because <br/>\nshe was so defensive. I would keep her feminine supplies, and plenty of clean <br/>\nunderwear, deodorant, etc., where she had access to more than she needed. I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t mention any extra laundry in the form of sheets or underwear. I&#39;d <br/>\njust do the laundry and have clean things available. She had awful periods. <br/>\nMigraines and vomiting for at least a day. Yes, we tried Midol, but Exedrine <br/>\nMigraine helped my daughter more. Diet (more vegetables and grains, less <br/>\nprocessed food and meat, lots more water) has helped this so much, but this <br/>\nhad to be her choice, not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What type of things do girls like to do?&quot; Gosh, that really depends on the <br/>\nperson, doesn&#39;t it? I remember when I was this age, having an aunt that <br/>\nseemed to be there just for me. She had a grown son, and called me &quot;her <br/>\ngirl&quot;. In her eyes, I was (or felt) perfect, loved, valued, interesting. Not <br/>\njudged and found wanting. You have the chance to be that person for Katie, to <br/>\nreally make a difference in her life.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt; Also.....I want to school her like I do the boys, in an unschooled manner <br/>\nbut <br/>\n I know she will need some structure. Can anyone suggest books that are <br/>\ngeared <br/>\n to girls  and ideas for teaching with them? Things that she and I can do <br/>\n together and that the boys could jump in with if they so choose? Is there a <br/>\n way to use the Dear America and American Girls series as a learning outlet? <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This was the age that we pulled my daughter out of school. She really needed <br/>\nthat &quot;deschooling&quot; time. How much &quot;schooling&quot; do you expect to get done with <br/>\nKatie only living with you until mid-June? Can you talk to her to see what <br/>\nher interests are? We rented a lot of videos around this time. It gave us a <br/>\nchance to spend time together watching and then discussing the movies. Some <br/>\nof them could be called &quot;educational&quot; by people looking for this kind of <br/>\nlearning, but some that lead to the best discussions would have looked like a <br/>\nwaste of time to some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy, if your post slips through the cracks and you don&#39;t get a reply from <br/>\nSandra or from Lisa, go knock on their doors.
