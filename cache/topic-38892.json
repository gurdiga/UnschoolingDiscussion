There are not thousands, but <br/>\nmillions of people for whom this kind of elitist world is a reality <br/>\n(whether at school or work). If your kids want to step into it, they <br/>\nmight as well do it well informed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am particularly of the school of thought that not everybody should <br/>\ngo to college in their teens. Nowadays, even public higher education <br/>\nis getting to be expensive. Many kids do not understand the cost of <br/>\nincurring in all those student loans just to get to college (believe <br/>\nme, I am one of them). If anything, teenagers should spend 3-4 years <br/>\nlooking for jobs in industries they may be interested in. Even if it <br/>\nmeans working in a hospital cafeteria because one day he or she may <br/>\nwant to become a doctor. So many kids go to college without knowing <br/>\nanything about the professions they want to join. It&#39;s really sad and <br/>\ninfuriating because the business of universities is to keep students, <br/>\nhopefully, for ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you did not like the business of primary education, you will be <br/>\nhorrified at the business of higher education. It is after all a <br/>\ntrillion dollar industry supported by the government and industry. <br/>\nEven your tax dollars go to private universities with billion dollar <br/>\nendowments like New York University (yep, that&#39;s 1billion in private <br/>\nendowments, not counting what they get in tax-supported money from <br/>\nthe government).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is that homeschoolers seem to have the skills necessary <br/>\nfor going to college. They have the people, researching and inquiring <br/>\nskills needed to seize the day. Many have some kind of first hand <br/>\nexperience on what they want to major. Again, I can&#39;t even begin to <br/>\nstress how important this is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing for me are the kids who are unschooling their <br/>\nway through college. In this month&#39;s HEM there is that article I <br/>\nmentioned and I hope Peter gets to write a more in depth article <br/>\nabout this phenomenon. One young woman finished 4 years of college <br/>\nwithout a diploma --she took all the courses she wanted; in effect, <br/>\nshe unschooled her way through 4 years of college.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this interesting because, if she decides to go to the route of <br/>\ngetting a graduate degree; she would actually be able to do so. Yes, <br/>\neven without high school and BA diplomas. There is a whole side of <br/>\nthe private higher education industry ---NYU, Yale, Columbia and <br/>\nHarvard have programs that I know of--- that caters to these <br/>\nuntraditional students (and have been doing it for about 15 years <br/>\nnow). Their admissions process is completely different from the one <br/>\ntraditional students go through AND YET they all end up in the same <br/>\ncourses. What is different is the name of the division or college <br/>\nthey graduated from (within the university) and who ends up caring if <br/>\nyou graduated from the Liberal Arts (or whatever they call it) <br/>\nprogram of Harvard? It is still Harvard.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I want my kids to go to Harvard? I want my kids to do whatever <br/>\nthey want --even if it means never setting foot at a university EVER. <br/>\nAgain, my husband and I have chosen to live an untraditional life <br/>\n--and I have more degrees than most people. Actually, I think it <br/>\nwould freak me out a bit if they chose to be plain 9 to 5ers --we are <br/>\nconsidered to be professional slackers after all (notwithstanding the <br/>\nfact that I work an average of 7 hours a day ON TOP OF HOMESCHOOLING <br/>\nand homemaking).

Their <br/>\nagita about homeschooling is that their kids (who are just 5 years <br/>\nold) will never get accepted into college. SIGH! Anyhow, one of my <br/>\njobs while working on my BA was at the admissions office of NYUs <br/>\nGraduate School of Arts and Sciences. I also worked as a Spanish & <br/>\nPortuguese Adjunct Instructor who was also a mentor for both <br/>\nundegrads and beginning graduate students. Granted, I worked for 3 <br/>\nyears at the graduate school admission&#39;s office, but because the <br/>\noffice shared information with the undergraduate admissions office; <br/>\nand because my department would make me the &#39;mamma&#39; of many lost <br/>\nsouls, let me clue you into a couple of things:<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Universities have a dirty little secret when it comes to the <br/>\nadmissions process. There are those that come through the <br/>\n&quot;floodgates&quot; (the admissions office) and there are those who get in <br/>\n&quot;pre-accepted&quot; by the heads of the departments. What does this mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE INTERVIEW is the unwritten rule for getting into a lot of <br/>\nuniversities I worked in or had friends working in (NYU, Columbia <br/>\nUniv, Yale, Hardvard, all the CUNYs, Rutgers Newark & New Brunswick).<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting admittance into a department is just like getting a job: The <br/>\nhigher up in the eschelons you get, the more likely you are to get to <br/>\nthe right person that will accept you. In the world of colleges, that <br/>\nmeans:<br/>\n<br/>\nResearch not only the place but the people: Kids should not go <br/>\n&#39;green&#39; to college --they really should have an idea of what their <br/>\nmajor is going to be. This does not only mean reading the catalog of <br/>\ncourses, but getting familiar with the work of their future <br/>\nprofessors. This means, reading their articles or books and, if <br/>\npossible, even sitting in some classes. The more they get to know a <br/>\nplace or a department, the less likely your son or daughter will <br/>\nwaste their time (and your money) in what we used to call at the <br/>\nadmissions office a &#39;bs BA&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever underestimate the power of a handshake: Time and again I would <br/>\nhear some of my bosses say, &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be nice if more kids came in <br/>\nso we could meet them&quot;. The ones that detested the idea were the ones <br/>\nthat, well, were the &#39;superstars&#39; who would have to do the tour of <br/>\nduty of chairing the department but could not wait to get holed up in <br/>\ntheir lairs to ponder about the pluperfect. It is from those <br/>\ninterviews (and not from &#39;connections&#39;) that came a lot of the kids <br/>\naccepted with scholarships. I cannot begin to stress how important it <br/>\nis to not only have an interview but to grill them about what they <br/>\nhave to offer. It shows determination and commitment. Two people are <br/>\nkey for these interviews:<br/>\n<br/>\nChairperson of the Department<br/>\nDepartment&#39;s Undergraduate Director<br/>\n<br/>\nAt big schools like NYU this is crucial because the Dean of <br/>\nUndergraduate Studies can only offer guidance to the College at <br/>\nlarge. In some instances they have a division that deals with <br/>\nschool-wide scholarships but these might be separate from the ones <br/>\nthat could be arranged through a department. Also, the DUS cannot <br/>\nreally counsel most of the time on which would be the best program to <br/>\njoin (within a department).<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Then there is the revered &#39;high school diploma&#39;. I am going to go <br/>\nwith the big school analogy here again. A lot of colleges have 2 <br/>\nundergraduate programs: one for high school kids and one for people <br/>\nwith &#39;unconventional educational backgrounds&#39;. These programs offer <br/>\nday and night courses and nowadays even e-courses. A student that <br/>\ndoes not get into NYUs conventional BA/BS colleges can still get a <br/>\ndiploma from Gallatin or the School of Professional Studies. And in <br/>\nmost cases you can still get student aid or even scholarships (there <br/>\nare not as many as in the conventional colleges but there is still <br/>\nsome --you have to research it based on the intended field of study).<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the job market that we live in (and my years at the GAS) I can <br/>\ntell you that, unless your son or daughter is going into a sales or <br/>\nmarketing job, for professional advancement, almost all jobs nowadays <br/>\nrequire graduate course degrees. The only jobs that I know of that do <br/>\nnot are as &#39;creatives&#39; in advertisement (although you need to have an <br/>\nart/writing background) and certainly in the worlds of software and <br/>\nweb development ---a good software programmer or information <br/>\narchitect is worth her weight in gold no matter what kind of degree <br/>\n(if any) she has.<br/>\n<br/>\nSATs are important for the &#39;grind&#39; of admissions offices. Transcripts <br/>\nand SATs are for the bureaucrats --they are there anyway, to weed <br/>\naway the thousands of applicants colleges like Columbia of Rutgers <br/>\nget in a year. A portfolio, an interview and if possible an auditing <br/>\nrelationship with professors of a department are most likely going to <br/>\nopen more doors than just a high SAT score and a perfect transcript.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich begs the question --yeah, but what if my kids wants to go to <br/>\ncollege to a whole other time zone? Again, it all comes down to: can <br/>\nyou afford it? Because if they want the kind of college experience <br/>\nmost kids have (the bs BA), it might not be worth to get a second <br/>\nmortgage on the house for that. They will probably end up in jobs <br/>\nthat will anyway require them to go to graduate school (there is such <br/>\na demand for jobs nowadays that a diploma, nor even a perfect BA <br/>\ntranscript is likely going to get yor kids a high paying job).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, by the time they do have to go for a graduate degree, the Ivy <br/>\nLeague or top-ten graduate school diploma would make sense. At this <br/>\ntime also, either the job will pay for it or your kid will be able to <br/>\nclaim it as a professional deduction on their tax returns.
