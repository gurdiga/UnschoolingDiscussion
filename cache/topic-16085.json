They are designed for boys and girls together, with both a male a female leader for every Circle (troop) emphasizing the balance of male and female energies complememting each other in work and play, and the equality of the sexes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are also designed to be inclusive of all faiths and traditions, as this quote outlines:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;While the orientation of the SpiralScouts program is based in Paganism, the organization is designed to be utilized by other groups, both nonsectarian as well as other minority faith groups. Religious-based programs are designed to be easily replaced by alternates based in other non-hostile minority faith traditions.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is lots more great information on their website.  They are based out of The Aquarian Tabernacle Church (Inter-faith Pagan) in Index, WA (NorthEast of the Greater Seattle Area.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15743,"nextTopicId":16050}}
