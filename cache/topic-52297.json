It seemed like my love and compassion would wash onto him.     The more I could ignore and let go the things he was saying and doing the better he would respond to me,    the calmer I was the calmer he would be.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe would have been alot worse if he would have been forced into doing alot of activities like other kids were,   but he had more time to himself and down time--that has been very important for his development,  and it gives us time to talk about dealing with emotions.     Its still hard for him to stop and breath but if I just quiet the situation and kind-of remind him of our discussions it works the best.<br/>\n <br/>\nA book we&#39;ve used for dealing with emotions is    Don&#39;t Rant and Rave on Wednesdays!        Talks about dealing with anger,   there are other books also by these authors,  by Adolph Moser         When I was reading this with my 9 and 8 yr olds,  I didn&#39;t think my 5 yr old was listening,  she was too busy to sit with us.  But every so often she would walk over and look at the pictures,   And she has shown me that she did hear some of it because she  said the other  day,   &quot;I counted, Mommy&quot;  meaning counting as her anger disappeared.       It also talks about breathing and calming our bodies.    I liked it.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps,   <br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Peggy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peggy@...\">peggy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 12/19/02 8:24:17 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I decided that now, I&#39;d see it as something he needed to do for a time, <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; pin some rag on his shoulder to chew on until he got over it!! lol<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How about a bandana around his neck?

I <br/>\nhave noticed since hes been home ( vs at school) he is doing a lot less <br/>\nchewing.. LOL.  I have never made a really big deal out if it.   <br/>\nOccasionally, if his shirt was gettting soaked and we were not at a place he <br/>\ncould go change, I would try to gently encourage him to stop chewing.  I pass <br/>\nhis clothes down to my nephew, but his shirts are mostly ruined with holes in <br/>\nthe neck or buttons chewed off.. He also still sucks his thumb.   Its like, <br/>\nunless he is really busy with his hands, he&#39;s  sucking his thumb.   If hes <br/>\ntoo busy with his hands, then his shirt is in his mouth.  I have basically <br/>\nignored the thumb sucking.. Its a non issue to me.  The only problem is that <br/>\nsometimes his thumb gets raw and cracked .. it frustrates him to have <br/>\nmedicine put on it cause he cant suck it.  He usually just switches thumbs <br/>\ntil it gets better.  Of course, he get comments from well meaning family <br/>\nmembers,&quot;When are you going to stop sucking your thumb?... Get that thumb out <br/>\nof your mouth&quot;   He has learned to expect these kinds of statements and he <br/>\njust makes an effort to not suck him thumb around his grandparents.
