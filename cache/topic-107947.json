This fear results in an extreme lack of <br/>\ngenerosity. This is her view of the world that includes strangers, <br/>\ncommunity members and family.

She looks at the world and sees people lurking <br/>\naround every corner who may require her to think outside of herself  and <br/>\nmake some kind of sacrifice, and this is the new, improved non-drinking <br/>\nversion of my mother.

But, the <br/>\nmuch-maligned notion of sacrifice as a bad thing is a remnant of the <br/>\nVictorian version of the all sacrificing Angel of the House, a reactive <br/>\nremnant of first-wave feminism, as I see it anyway.

They (parents) resent any <br/>\ninconvenience their children  cause them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the only two options were zero sacrifice  and total sacrifice, total <br/>\nsacrifice would be better for the  children.

For example,  <br/>\na young child has dramatically different needs than a teenager or an adult. Or <br/>\na  family member struggling with a work situation or a health problem will <br/>\nhave  different needs.<br/>\n <br/>\nCertainly there are parents who resent any inconvenience their children may  <br/>\ncause them. But my perspective is that for parents who are NOT like that,  <br/>\nmeeting their children&#39;s needs is not about sacrifice. It&#39;s love, and a happy  <br/>\nthing. <br/>\n <br/>\nPeople here have talked about changing their perspectives on housework,  <br/>\nthinking about it in terms of caring for their families with love. Would they  <br/>\nconsider that sacrifice? No....that&#39;s the whole point.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think that sacrifice is an attitude, rather than an action. You may have  a <br/>\ndifferent perspective.<br/>\n <br/>\nI find the question about Julian perplexing though. It&#39;s so hypothetical,  <br/>\nand so unrealistic. Of course, being in right relations with my family, I  <br/>\ntalked about the possibility of doing a conference with them first,  and both were <br/>\nenthusiastic. So, first, doing a conference that they had issues  with <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have brought me joy, and wouldn&#39;t have been a sacrifice to let go  of. <br/>\nParticularly since it was an unschooling conference -- it&#39;s as much about  Julian <br/>\nand Beth as it is about me. <br/>\n <br/>\nSecond, I cannot imagine a situation in which something non-abusive I was  <br/>\ndoing would create a situation in which &quot;every moment of work or discussion on  <br/>\nit wounded him and your relationship.&quot; If that were the case, I think there&#39;d <br/>\nbe  bigger issues with both him and our relationship than planning a <br/>\nconference. <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to focus here on extremes of &quot;inconvenienced&quot;  <br/>\nparents or truly unrealistic situations. People reading here, whether or not  <br/>\nthey ultimately embrace unschooling, or however far they apply it, are not  <br/>\nlikely to be those people. And the unrealistic situations are a little confusing  <br/>\nand are more about intellectual repartee than about real life unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107958,"nextTopicId":107978}}
