We <br/>\nboth read an article (in an old Utne reader) about a teacher who used <br/>\nunconventional methods (including playful wrestling in the classroom) to <br/>\nconnect with a very troubled kid who was acting up a lot at school.  After <br/>\nawhile, this kid and the teacher developed a relationship that worked and the <br/>\nkid behaved pretty well for the rest of the year.  But on the last day of the <br/>\nyear the kid set his schoolbooks on fire on the bus.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband persuaded me that the point of the article was that the teacher <br/>\nhad broken through and created an emotional bond with the kid, BUT the <br/>\nteacher was going to be gone from the kid&#39;s life once the school year ended.  <br/>\nAnd everyone accepted that severing of the relationship as normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s much better for our kids to love and trust us, their parents, <br/>\nand have us *stay* with them, rather than have these disposable relationships <br/>\nwith teachers.  (I realize there are some exceptions where the teacher takes <br/>\nan ongoing interest in the child, beyond the paid experience.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7077,"nextTopicId":7085}}
