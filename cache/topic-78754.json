Really, just relax.   We are talking about a process.. <br/>\nNo one is advocating or suggesting to &quot;GET THEM BOOKS OUT and teach Johnny to <br/>\nread!  HOOKED ON PHONICS TO THE RESCUE!  OH, Lord, somebody call Ned Vare!!, <br/>\nmy kid can&#39;t read yet!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling works.  No one is saying that it doesn&#39;t   Nobody is saying that <br/>\nchildren will not learn to read, when they are ready, through unschooling ( <br/>\nthe happy bubbly kind that someone else mentioned).  My initial point was just <br/>\nthat reading does not come naturally to all children, OR adults.    It&#39;s not a <br/>\nslam on unschooling or a &quot;loop hole&quot; Nobody is saying &quot;OH OH.. unschooling <br/>\ndoes not work with everybody&quot;   Why do you think that everything is a <br/>\n&quot;questioning the integrity&quot; , of the &quot;rightness&quot; of unschooling? That is not the case at <br/>\nall.  <br/>\n<br/>\nATTENTION NEWBIES WHO ARE ON THE FENCE, in case you mistakenly thought I <br/>\nmeant that unschooling is not good for a child who does not read &quot;naturally&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGOD, unschooling is the absolute, 100%, without a doubt, BEST  way for folks <br/>\nwho have difficulty learning to read to be able to overcome those challanges <br/>\nand go on to be the best readers they want to be.  I know it works.  I have <br/>\nseen, read, heard, and LIVED that it works.    But it will take all the &quot;things&quot;, <br/>\ninteraction, support, exposure,  that others have talked about, things that <br/>\nare PROactive, rather than REactive, to help the child learn to read at thier <br/>\nown time and comfort level. NO NO NO, not lessons and workbooks and programs <br/>\nand &quot;intervention&quot;  Just living and loving and being there for the kid.  <br/>\nProviding books.. heck all kinds of printed material, reading aloud to them, <br/>\nanswering thier questions, all the stuff other folks have already mentioned.     <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78750,"nextTopicId":78760}}
