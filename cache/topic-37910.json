They may flounder a bit as they enter adulthood, trying to decide what to do with themselves, but I think that is because they are THINKING about what to do - they aren&#39;t on automatic pilot like so many schooled kids - they aren&#39;t on a track - not even the &quot;graduate-go-to-college-get-a-good-job&quot; track. Kids raised mindfully, raised to examine their own learning and to feel responsible for their own decisions and for the life they CHOOSE to lead - will continue to do that as young adults. So- be forwarned - it is wonderful to behold, but can be disconcerting to parents to watch their grown kids be so brave and creative and full of energy and confidence!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2856611,"authorName":"Judie C.
