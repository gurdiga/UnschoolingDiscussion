We live <br/>\nin Portugal and they are really cheap here and I would love her to be able <br/>\nto bottle feed it from a baby.   Does anyone know how much they are in <br/>\ngeneral for vet bills?  I do not want to take on a HUGE expense with this <br/>\ngoat.  Small expense ok....we just can&#39;t afford a lot of big vet bills for <br/>\nwhat will be a pet for the most part.   I really want to do this for her <br/>\nthough because I think it would be a great learning experience for both my <br/>\ngirls.   Does anyone have any other experience with goats they would like to <br/>\nshare with someone who has never had one????  &lt;big cheesy PLEASE grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Corallyn Berger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hape2day@...\">hape2day@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] cows and a rant [long]<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 18 Jul 2000 20:50:17 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A cow is a large expense and often comes with large<br/>\n&gt; &gt; vet bills.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe get a newborn heifer and bottle feed her so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that she is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tame, then she will be easy to handle when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eventually milk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her.  If she had a male calf, that can be raised for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beef.   A problem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these days is finding a cow with teats long enough<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to get a hold of,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they have been bred for shorter teats for milking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; machines.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A goat may be a better option for a dairy animal,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t hurt<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you as much if they inadvertently stand on your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; toes, and are so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; easy for children to handle, even my four year old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can milk our goat.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t know where she got her beef cow but she paid<br/>\n&gt;$30 for it. She got it as a new born, I think it was<br/>\n&gt;no more than a week old. I plan to do something<br/>\n&gt;simmilar for my beef cow. Later I plan to have the<br/>\n&gt;milk cow. I have never had goats milk and have heard<br/>\n&gt;opposing views on the flavor. I have considered a goat<br/>\n&gt;instead but don&#39;t know much about them. Are there<br/>\n&gt;stores that sell goats milk so I could try it before I<br/>\n&gt;make a decission on an animal?
