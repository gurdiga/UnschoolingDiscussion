They often race each other on their rocking horses or play with the kitchen or Logan&#39;s Hot Wheels cars and street play rug. A recent favorite toy to play with together is his Thomas The Tank Engine set. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey tend to do alot of things together, like race Logan&#39;s two Monster Trucks around the house or push each other in his push-car outside. <br/>\n <br/>\nMegan isn&#39;t really talking yet, but Logan will ask to play Memory or another younger child&#39;s board game, and sometimes Megan will try to play as well or she will go watch TV or play with her dolls. We&#39;ll play with stringing beads or lacing cards, or blocks together.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe also read ALOT and often. Megan is more into books than Logan is, but he will listen if not sit still for them like she will. He&#39;s usually playing with his cars or Thomas while I read.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh..Logan is 3 and Megan is 2. They are 15 1/2 months apart in age. I&#39;m often asked if they are fraternal twins. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey ask often to help me when I&#39;m cleaning so I&#39;ll spray 409 on the wall or cabinet fronts or fridge, or the table, hand them washcloths and let them have at it and &quot;help&quot; me. Logan is really good about helping to hold the dustpan when I sweep. He&#39;s recently begun asking to set the table for meals. <br/>\n <br/>\nI am really beginning to see how not MAKING them do things in turn leaves them more amenable to helping out. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth (formerly known as Elizabeth in MA)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85197,"nextTopicId":85192}}
