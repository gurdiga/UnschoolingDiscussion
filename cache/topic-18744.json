(I&#39;m the one who was feeling<br/>\nchocolate-deprived)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe like to dye eggs for Easter, so for a few weeks before Easter I poke<br/>\nholes in eggs and blow out the inside and save the shells for dying.  We<br/>\ndo some hard boiled too.  Dd really wanted to buy the egg dye kit, but<br/>\nthe store was out so we used vinegar and food coloring and got far more<br/>\nvibrant colors than last year!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Easter morning, Dh and I went in the backyard and hid colored eggs<br/>\nand a few Hershey&#39;s kisses while Dd&#39;s were in the front yard doing the<br/>\nsame.  Then we watched them hunt, and THEN they watched us hunt.  They<br/>\nsaid it was the best egg hunt ever!
