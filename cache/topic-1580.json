They are US$19 each including p&p, and can be ordered by emailing me<br/>\ndirectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who have no idea what I&#39;m talking about, &quot;Unschooling Instead&quot; is basically a<br/>\nreport about what the kids and I achieved in each subject in a year, using the relaxed<br/>\nunschooling method. The children were aged 4 and 3 at the time. The report is 133 pages<br/>\nlong, A4 size, and includes around 4000 educational references to things they did, under<br/>\nthe appropriate subject headings. It also includes about 50 photos/copies of the<br/>\nchildren&#39;s work.

In addition I have listed in the report a<br/>\nmyriad of everyday activities that we all undertake with children that at first glance we<br/>\ndon�t think of as �educational�, or if so, into which subject area they would fall under.<br/>\nThis would help in the learning of &#39;educationalese&#39; for using when speaking to department<br/>\nofficials, and also as a guide for compiling an exemption from attending school for their<br/>\nchildren, if this is what is required.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also may be particularly useful to:<br/>\n(a) people starting out homeschooling with children of any age;<br/>\n(b) people who don&#39;t understand how unschooling can work;<br/>\nand (c) people looking for a method of record-keeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy apologies to anyone who gets this message more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMandy Tyler<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n|=============================================================|<br/>\n Mandy Tyler (mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blondie@...\">blondie@...</a>) (New Zealand) My Book �Unschooling Instead�:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unveiling.org/resources/mtyler.htm\">http://www.unveiling.org/resources/mtyler.htm</a>     My Homeschooling Bookmarks:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/mandyssite\">http://members.xoom.com/mandyssite</a>    My NZ Unschoolers List: Email:<br/>\n mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NZUnschoolers-subscribe@onelist.com\">NZUnschoolers-subscribe@onelist.com</a> (New Zealanders ONLY)<br/>\n NZ Home Educators <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/astley/homeeduc.htm\">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/astley/homeeduc.htm</a><br/>\n|=============================================================|</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1577,"nextTopicId":1581}}
