When my kids were in public school, I<br/>\nfelt my life was spent driving here and there....chained to the &#39;school&#39;<br/>\nschedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a family, we get so much done TOGETHER each day...it&#39;s great!!  Over this<br/>\nsummer, I have gotten us into a pattern of getting the kids up at 7 or so,<br/>\nthen the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. get dressed<br/>\n2. have breakfast<br/>\n3. clean up kitchen<br/>\n4  do chores till 9am<br/>\n5. do some &#39;school&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSInce we now get the house in order each morning, this has freed up a lot of<br/>\ntime for me.  I have been getting up with my dh at 5am...send him off to<br/>\nwork....watch a bit of news....then I exercise at 6:30am to about 7:15.   I<br/>\nreally need this time alone!!   Makes me prepared for the day with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople ask me &#39;arent you sick of the kids?&#39;  Really, I am NOT.  It is like<br/>\nyou said, Jill, we all find our alone time.   I have also noticed the kids<br/>\nget along so much better, too.  More team work, more cooperation.  Lots of<br/>\nimaginative things happening.  Example...they have &#39;discovered&#39; all of our<br/>\nold RECORDS and tapes....they are DANCING as we speak...making up patterns<br/>\nand moves to dance too.  Guess this is our &#39;gym&#39; class!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not feel that I am sacrificing anything to be with my kids and to<br/>\nhomeschool them....I think this choice has made our lives so much better!!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Karen<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\nKaren & David Hoogland ï¿½<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kdhoogland@...\">kdhoogland@...</a><br/>\n------------------------------------------<br/>\nCheck out our Webpages!!<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~Hoagys/index.html\">http://members.tripod.com/~Hoagys/index.html</a><br/>\n  Updated 8/9/99<br/>\n-----------------------------------------<br/>\nIf a man was to go so far into a forest that a woman could<br/>\nnot hear him speak, would he still be wrong?<br/>\n----------------------------------------<br/>\n  Homeschoolers2000 Email List: To subscribe, go to<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/homeschoolers2000\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/homeschoolers2000</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Jill &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jillmca@...\">jillmca@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, August 25, 1999 10:34 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] sacrafices for homeschooling - a modern myth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Jill&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jillmca@...\">jillmca@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;feels like she would be giving up her life and she doesn&#39;t want to do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wonder what makes that a consideration for some?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I feel that the more interesting thing is that it is just not true.
