I was planning on seeing it myself, but not <br/>\nanymore. <br/>\nIt sounds disgusting and exactly the reason why we don&#39;t &quot;go to school.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s interesting.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re going to live  your life in reaction mode, unschooling will be <br/>\ndifficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason I&#39;m glad my kids don&#39;t go to school is that it&#39;s a place where <br/>\nother people tell them what they should want and like, what is &quot;not until next <br/>\nyear&quot; and what is &quot;too babyish.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nJudging that movie by the list of &quot;objectional&quot; items, when the movie is NOT <br/>\nabout those topics is not good use of personal thought.   If other people are <br/>\ngoing to do your thinking for you, why unschool?  You could buy a <br/>\npre-sanitized curriculum.  There are several out there.  They tell history and science and <br/>\neverything in VERY sanitized versions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr there&#39;s the real world, which doesn&#39;t come all edited and cleaned up, <br/>\nwhich is WONDERFUL, because by coming across things they didn&#39;t know, children <br/>\nwill learn.  By sticking to the safest and most well-lit trails, life stays cold.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I would never let my 11 or 13 yo. dd <br/>\n(if I had one) watch that. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNEVER?  Never their whole lives or just until their birthdays?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12, 15 and 17 year olds watched it (the oldest again, with me) and they <br/>\nwere able to discuss characters, writing, comedic styles, the fantasy sequence <br/>\nof the mall&#39;s fountain as an African watering hole, the motivations of the <br/>\ncharacters, the awakening morality...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are doing very well without being in an over-sheltered environment.  <br/>\nIs it genetics?  I don&#39;t think so.  I think it&#39;s openness and acceptance.  I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s a willingness to look around and either ignore things or discuss <br/>\nthem.  Hiding things from them doesn&#39;t contribute to growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I do hide:  Murders and crazy abuses.  I don&#39;t say, &quot;Hey, did you <br/>\nhear about this prisoner abuse?&quot;  They only very vaguely knew about the <br/>\nkidnapped Mormon girl.  Kirby and Marty probably read bits as AOL came up.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink Holly ever knew.  She might read about it someday, or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe opposite of sheltering children from the world is NOT shoving their faces <br/>\nin it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, there is a balance.  If a child as old as 11 or 13 wanted to do or see <br/>\nsomething, I wouldn&#39;t prevent it.  I would discuss it, but what they do isn&#39;t <br/>\nmine to decide entirely (in my way of thinking).  Instead of controlling my <br/>\nchildren, I try to just give them an open safe environment and they KNOW they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to watch or do or be any way that makes them uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160224365,"authorName":"belstone@comcast.net","from":"belstone@...","profile":"mdpercin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: mean girls","postDate":"1084329242","msgId":93891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1MTIyMDA0MDIzNC41ODQ5LjQwQTE4RDFBMDAwNzJDMTcwMDAwMTZEOTIyMDA3NTA3NDRGRjlBOTE5MDhCOEM5MzlBQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93918,"prevInTime":93890,"nextInTime":93892,"topicId":93891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sheila,  What is that movie rated?!!!
