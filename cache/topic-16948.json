I am a sahm/wahm from Michigan (Detroit area) <br/>\nand I just took my girls out of public school in January. My daughters <br/>\nare almost 12 years old (12 in April) and almost 9 years old (9 <br/>\nin May). I also have an almost 7 week old son.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed, after reading some of the postings, that some of you have <br/>\ndaughters who are my kid&#39;s ages. Would any of your girls want to <br/>\nbecome e-mail pals with my girls? They have been asking me every day <br/>\nabout finding some pen pals who also home school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fell into this unschooling thing --- I was pregnant, miserable and <br/>\ntired, so they pretty much guided themselves to what they wanted to <br/>\nlearn when I first took them out of public school in January. Then, <br/>\nwhen my son was born, well ... you all know what it&#39;s like having a <br/>\nnewborn --- so they kept pursuing their own interests because of the <br/>\ndemands of the baby. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis unschooling thing seems very natural --- just like it felt when <br/>\nthey were very small and I taught them throughout the day --- or they <br/>\ninvestigated the world around them on their own. However, on the other <br/>\nhand, I feel like I should be giving them more structure and so do <br/>\nthey --- they want worksheets and assignments. I bought some worksheet <br/>\nbooks and they use them occasionally. But mostly they love to play <br/>\nBarbie&#39;s, make doll clothes, draw, write, read, do computer games or <br/>\nplay with Lego&#39;s. Hmmm. I&#39;m just new to this and trying to adjust ... <br/>\n <br/>\nAny advice? I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m doing okay and should just keep doing <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m doing, but then the guilt sets in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nNancy from Michigan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16944,"nextTopicId":16953}}
