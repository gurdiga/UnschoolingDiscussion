Through my journey I have learned a lot!  Do not use the shampoos as they are dangerous as well as ineffective.  It seems that the strands of lice going around today have become tollerant to our treatments.  You can visit www.licemeister.com for all sorts of wonderfull information.  What ever treatment you use, never use the prescriptions that may still be available.  Several children have become seriously ill and a few have died.  Get to picking and get a good come.  The site that I posted above has the best come there is and all of the proceeds go back into research for a somday end to lice all together.<br/>\nHopw this was helpful, <br/>\n<br/>\ntxmom<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;simpsons&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michigan@...\">michigan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks for all the advise I will certainly pass this onto my friend and keep a file on record just in case mine get it!<br/>\n&gt;thanks again <br/>\n&gt;Tanya<br/>\n&gt;  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a> <br/>\n&gt;  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Thursday, August 09, 2001 10:20 AM<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Lice/was Question about the objection of shot requirements(?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  snip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anybody know how to get rid of or prevent lice? naturally!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Nitpicking!
