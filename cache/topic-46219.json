It&#39;s based on carbon 14 levels in plants<br/>\nand animals, in all living things and it accumulates at the same rate as<br/>\nother carbons but upon death of the living organism C14 stops<br/>\naccumulating and starts to decay.  The rate of decay is known but the<br/>\nproblem is in the rate of absorption while the critter or plant was<br/>\nalive.  C14 dating assumes atmospheric radiation levels have remained<br/>\nrelatively the same throughout history.  Not exactly the same, but<br/>\nrelatively the same.  Scientist have taken steps to adjust for<br/>\natmospheric difference and there are standards for C14 dating.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWe should remember this is only useful for about 60,000. years.  Most C14<br/>\nlabs agree that they can be accurate at 70,000 years to within 1,000,<br/>\nyears.  I think I can live with that.  A thing could be 70,000 years old<br/>\nplus or minus 1,000 years.  Good enough for me. Later than that the rate<br/>\nof decay is to narrow to be measured, and other means of dating must be<br/>\nused. ( hotdate.com?&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something to be said about dating according to the material a<br/>\nthing was found in.  If were talking about rock that is a certain age and<br/>\na fossil in that rock, we certainly know the animal didn&#39;t crawl into the<br/>\nhardened rock to die.  We certainly know the two existed at the same<br/>\ntime.  If rock can be dated (that&#39;s radio metric dating, which is<br/>\nprobably not a respectable measurement either according to creationists) <br/>\nthan it&#39;s reasonable to assume a fossil within that rock wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nyounger.  Radio carbon dating is not used for rocks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also let&#39;s remember many useful instruments of measure are not<br/>\nentirely accurate yet we use and rely on them every day.  A thermometer<br/>\nmeasures the temperature at a given location but can&#39;t measure the<br/>\ntemperature three blocks away nor adjust for wind chill.  Our clocks and<br/>\ncalendars are imperfect and need adjustment.  The Earth&#39;s rotation is<br/>\nslowing, the moon continues to move away from us, there are many, many<br/>\nmethods of measure we use that have to be adjusted and perfected yet we<br/>\naccept them as useful for us right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":60467660,"authorName":"louisam1@juno.com","from":"louisam1@...","profile":"louisam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Carbon dating","postDate":"1034463058","msgId":46219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDEyLjE2MTU1Ni4tMzgxNDQxLjIubG91aXNhbTFAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46230,"prevInTime":46218,"nextInTime":46220,"topicId":46219,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1655632184\">&lt;&lt;What made you change your mind?
