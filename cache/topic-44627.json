I would like to know what others think? <br/>\nI didn&#39;t interpret John Holt&#39;s opinions and thoughts the way she did she, she says Holt believes they&#39;re(children) born with the knowledge of how to get knowledge.  I don&#39;t ever remember him ever saying that in any writings.  To me he would say the child knows when to learn it and will always want to learn, nothing wrong with helping them.  Obviously, they won&#39;t know about how to look up things on the computer unless we say, hey we can look that up!  And then they probably can figure it out. etc.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know....<br/>\nI think we all can interpret things differently.  I know I just always felt like he was such an advocate for the child that he wouldn&#39;t have wanted us to have a total hands off approach.  And this is the way this author believes we unschoolers live.<br/>\nI resent the way she portrays the unschooling group; when it can be so wonderful, so natural and so great.<br/>\nOk, I&#39;m off my soap box now.<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n Dalene and Andy wrote: I came across this woman&#39;s site looking for unschooling info. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe have a lot of thoughts on unschooling.
