Even just a couple of drinks in the evening can <br/>\ncause you to be wide awake at 3 or 4 a.m., and up for an hour. There are <br/>\nmany evenings I weigh which I want more: another glass of wine or an <br/>\nuninterrupted night&#39;s sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, pregnant women wake up a lot. Maybe this is nature&#39;s method of <br/>\npreparing us for the round-the-clock care of a newborn. The way to avoid <br/>\nthat, I guess, is obvious! (Does that take us back to not having wine before <br/>\nbed? Hmmm....)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27109,"nextTopicId":27695}}
