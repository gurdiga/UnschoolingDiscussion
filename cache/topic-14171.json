Oh that&#39;s right, screw up our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entire democracy. I forgot.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a speech on the Senate floor, Massachusetts senator Ted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kennedy commented that the loss of Florida&#39;s sizable elderly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; population will free up billions of dollars in social security<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; funds. &quot;These are valuable funds which can now be redirected<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; toward national defense. We can finally rebuild our demoralized,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weakened military,&quot; said the Senator to roaring applause.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a result of the Florida screw-up, the House and Senate decreed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a new election will take place in early December. This time,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ballots in each state will be tabulated by robots. &quot;It is clear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that our human vote-counting system is too inherently flawed,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. &quot;The presence of these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new, superior robot mast- err, I mean - tabulators will ensure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 100% accuracy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Remember,&quot; said Hastert, &quot;every vote counts, especially if it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; counted by robots.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dynamiting will begin along the Florida border next Wednesday,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after which the state will be completely geographically separated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the United States.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;After that, they&#39;re on their own,&quot; said Hastert. &quot;I hope they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sink.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13757,"nextTopicId":14172}}
