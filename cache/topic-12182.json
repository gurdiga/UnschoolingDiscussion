I ask the question because some people think that their kids, <br/>\ntoddlers even, will automatically make a choice. Even when mom has to make <br/>\nthat choice, the children are learning, that they do have control over their <br/>\nsituation, but that they can also choose to give that control away.  A few <br/>\nchildren are in fact happy to give that control away, but the vast majority <br/>\nwant to keep it, and will learn in pretty short order how to do that by <br/>\nchoosing from the mom&#39;s alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jaam1224@cs.com","from":"Jaam1224@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xXZdif9PRg5bEnHat9zQbF0nuJO4_MrsSegQfhoxXsvdImzLiu57CWbHQ2EEQuBVqI0cKc6R","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Love and Logic (was Questions from a Newbie!)","postDate":"967299763","msgId":12186,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDViLmE5MmE2OTYuMjZkOTJjYjNAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12182,"nextInTopic":12216,"prevInTime":12185,"nextInTime":12187,"topicId":12182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/25/00 10:56:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Cararmst@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-705636255\">In a message dated 8/25/00 10:56:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Cararmst@...\">Cararmst@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Do you make the choice for them?
