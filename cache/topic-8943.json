It is soooo rude.

But you know those little $#@%&s made me suffer so much in<br/>\n&gt;childbirth that I decided there and then that I&#39;d make them suffer too!<br/>\n&gt;So I keep them home and deprive them of all that neat stuff at school<br/>\n&gt;just to pay them back for all that childbirth pain. I torture them<br/>\n&gt;daily, and I beat them several times a week to remind them what will<br/>\n&gt;happen when we get home if they don&#39;t look real happy when we&#39;re out.<br/>\n&gt;Yes sir, I&#39;m having a wonderful time making them pay for all that pain&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I finally pause to draw breath, the questioner invariably blushes<br/>\n&gt;and says &quot;I guess that was a silly question, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; And sometimes<br/>\n&gt;we even go on to have a meaningful discussion about education!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Carol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jaam1224@cs.com","from":"Jaam1224@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Btf5FIswQlduBGAVvLitupYooInMQFZV7pX42lZsEeiMpp5X-k8K3qcHVd6_rRUR1cS1Z813","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Top 10 homeschooling answers...","postDate":"960292957","msgId":8943,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlLjVlODM1ODYuMjY2ZTQyNWRAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8960,"prevInTime":8942,"nextInTime":8944,"topicId":8943,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/5/00 11:12:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time, mjcmbrwn@ihug.co.nz writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1523355211\">In a message dated 6/5/00 11:12:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjcmbrwn@...\">mjcmbrwn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &quot;Oh hell, no!
