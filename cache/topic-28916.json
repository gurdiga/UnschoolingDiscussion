Another group of<br/>\nchildren were playing there - 6 kids of ages about 5 to I&#39;m guessing 9 or 10<br/>\nwith two possibly related mothers who were sitting together on the grass<br/>\nperiodically shouting out instructions (Don&#39;t do that...stop this...etc).<br/>\nAnother unrelated brother and sister came along shortly after. The boy<br/>\njoined in the fluid running around games of the main group, while Jayn was<br/>\nplaying with the little girl for a while. There was some confusion over who<br/>\nwas going to use the slide for a while, but they sorted it out and all was<br/>\nwell for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the little girl went to the swings with her grandmother, and Jayn<br/>\njoined in with the other group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout five minutes later the other mothers stood up and walked off to the<br/>\nswings area, 50 feet away, behind where I was sitting on the grass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a ripple of little heads turning as the now group of 7 noticed that<br/>\ntheir caretakers were suddenly inattentive - it was like watching dominoes<br/>\nfall. Then, whoosh, I felt the atmosphere change. In the four seconds it<br/>\ntook me to get to my feet and start walking towards the equipment, every one<br/>\nof the 7 had attacked Jayn with fistfuls of sand - viciously and<br/>\ndeliberately. She ran, astonishingly fast, up the equipment to the very top<br/>\nof the big twisting slide - at the bottom of which lay in wait the biggest<br/>\nboy with his handfuls of sand. Jayn called out &quot;no don&#39;t&quot; a bit as they<br/>\napproached, and then I just bellowed - &quot;Stop throwing sand at my daughter!&quot;<br/>\nDidn&#39;t know I had that volume in me actually. They all stopped and stared,<br/>\nlooking almost dazed - it was as if they hadn&#39;t realized she had an adult<br/>\n(protector) with her. I then loudly said something about sand being painful<br/>\nto eyes, and went back to sit down.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a moment of general confusion, Jayn came down the slide - safely - and<br/>\nran to me. She asked about food, which we didn&#39;t have and then wanted to go<br/>\nto eat. I noticed once we got home that she was not actually hungry, so I<br/>\nthink that was her way of leaving without losing face in her own mind. This<br/>\nis the first time something scary like this has happened. It was weird and<br/>\ndisturbing - to me anyway; Jayn has not mentioned the event or wanted to<br/>\navoid that park. BTW the other parents evidently neither heard nor saw any<br/>\nof it, being too busy enjoying a swing themselves. Jayn called out goodbye<br/>\nto the little girl perfectly pleasantly, and it was not until later that she<br/>\nwas talking to me about throwing sand at people being wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what I should have done differently, if anything. It seemed to<br/>\nme that Jayn was in actual danger from a mob of bullies. The biggest boy had<br/>\nseemed quite nice in the way he was interacting with the younger kids, while<br/>\nhis mother was watching him. It was really flabbergasting to see this happen<br/>\nright in front of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I&#39;d say that, first. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve found each other and <br/>\nare playing together. It is so great to have friends and time to play, <br/>\ndon&#39;t you think?&quot;  I&#39;d maybe go on and say something like, &quot;Don&#39;t you <br/>\njust love it when you&#39;re playing together and everything just falls <br/>\ninto place and everybody is having a great time? I remember, when I was <br/>\na kid, what it was like to completely get involved in what we were <br/>\nplaying and it was so cool!! I&#39;m pretty sure that every kid knows what <br/>\nI&#39;m talking about, right?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am a little concerned, though, because  there are things that can <br/>\nmess up that really special kind of super fun playtime, so it is <br/>\nimportant to be aware of those things and avoid them. I mean, that <br/>\nmagical wonderful kind of really GOOD playtime doesn&#39;t just happen, it <br/>\ndoes take some work - kids have to be careful to be really accepting <br/>\nand kind to each other, so everybody feels free to relax and really get <br/>\nINTO their play, whatever it is they&#39;re doing. And kids need to know <br/>\nthat if they are being bugged or teased by something or by somebody, <br/>\nthat their friends will defend them and kind of take care of each <br/>\nothers&#39; feelings. That&#39;s what friends do and that&#39;s why they have such <br/>\na good time together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just had this little thing I felt like saying, because I <br/>\nthink kids&#39; play is really special and important and I care about all <br/>\nof you and hope you&#39;ll have the very BEST time playing together. You <br/>\ncan talk about it more together, if you feel like it, or just think <br/>\nabout it or whatever. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - not probably my exact words, because it would be more <br/>\nnatural-sounding, this sounds sort of stilted.

We are talking about unschooling  <br/>\nparents - not just anybody. First, remember, I said 2 or 3 minutes - so  <br/>\nwe&#39;re talking a very brief little interlude. Second, I said the parent  <br/>\nisn&#39;t accusing or blaming or saying anybody is at fault, no matter HOW  <br/>\nnicely they say it. Third, I&#39;m assuming the parents are the type to be  <br/>\ninvolved and friendly and do things together with ALL the kids,  <br/>\nbecause, in general, that is true of unschooling parents, they get to  <br/>\nknow the kids their friends play with, they are generally well-liked by  <br/>\nthe kids their friends play with because they are fun and generous and  <br/>\nkind. They tend to have a certain amount of natural &quot;authority&quot; - not  <br/>\nto make demands and give orders, but to be taken seriously and listened  <br/>\nto carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe if my children were playing at the ball fields (as they often  <br/>\n&gt; have) I<br/>\n&gt; might send them along with some cookies or even show up with some  <br/>\n&gt; popsicles to<br/>\n&gt; share with their new &quot;friends&quot;.

A puppy. Whatever! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>\nIf kids are having problems with other kids, they NEED their parents  <br/>\nnearby.

Try rereading it.  AND - the kids who  <br/>\nwe are talking about, at least a couple of them are unschoolers. You  <br/>\nare persisting in thinking that I&#39;m just suggesting some sort of  <br/>\nsweetened-lecture directed at the problem kids, but that is not what I  <br/>\nhad suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe explaining the virtues of kindness and how it might work to  <br/>\n&gt; everyone in<br/>\n&gt; the groups advantage would work on some groups but from my own personal<br/>\n&gt; experiences it would probably have about the same affect as telling  <br/>\n&gt; them not to<br/>\n&gt; mess with YOUR KID.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s your experience. I think it is probably because you were  <br/>\nstill directing it at the problem kids and everybody knew it. My  <br/>\nsuggestion is not directed at them - in fact, they don&#39;t have to even  <br/>\nBE there - it is all the OTHER kids that need the empowerment to resist  <br/>\nfalling into step with the belittling and insulting tone that a few  <br/>\nmight set.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I live in a transient area, lots of military children, lots of FBI and<br/>\n&gt; children of political party families that move with the administration  <br/>\n&gt; change.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe in the part of the State that I grew up in, a talk on kindness  <br/>\n&gt; would be the<br/>\n&gt; thing, here it simply wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You thought I was offering a magic bullet - that I thought a parent  <br/>\ncould lecture some teasing kid about how much nicer the world would be  <br/>\nif they&#39;d just be nice? And that would magically change their behavior?  <br/>\nNah. I&#39;m not stupid. I suggested something that might help to empower  <br/>\nthe children to feel strong enough to take some control over the tone  <br/>\nof their own playtime under conditions in which they ARE having a good  <br/>\nenough time to want to stay, but are repeatedly getting hurt feelings,  <br/>\ntoo. I suggested that parents try this approach first, because it is  <br/>\nmore empowering to the kids, before they resort to going over and tell  <br/>\nthe problem-causing kid to knock it off.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wish it would, that would be wonderful if that&#39;s all it took to stop  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; wicked teasing that some kids experience on a daily basis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You generalized to a larger problem and what I offered is not  <br/>\ngeneralizable. I&#39;m not talking about teasing that goes in in schools,  <br/>\nfor example. I&#39;m not talking about bullying or physical violence. I&#39;m  <br/>\ntalking about kids who are pretty much having a good time playing  <br/>\ntogether in a group and want to continue, but could use some help in  <br/>\nhow to handle it when a kid or two is causing hurt feelings. My point  <br/>\nis that if you can inspire those kids to feel like they&#39;re all in it  <br/>\ntogether, that they care about each other and should defend each other,  <br/>\nand let them know that it does take some effort to create the kind of  <br/>\natmosphere they want - accepting and kind, for example, then just that  <br/>\nknowledge, that they have the right to expect it and that they can work  <br/>\ntogether to achieve it, can change the dynamics a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; glena<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

Some people can be inspiring to a group and some can&#39;t talk to them <br/>\nwithout making the kids feel that they&#39;ve been chastised and THAT can <br/>\ncause more problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   It<br/>\n&gt; definitely depends on the age group of the children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t agree. Kids and adults of all ages can be inspired to <br/>\nbehave more kindly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes it&#39;s better to let<br/>\n&gt; the children find their own way in the group of children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes people do that because they don&#39;t know how to intervene <br/>\nwithout making things worse, this is especially true if the adults <br/>\ncan&#39;t talk about problems without making the kids feel they are being <br/>\nblamed, but it IS possible to let all the kids know you&#39;re there to <br/>\nhelp and that they are NOT just being left on their own to find their <br/>\nown way all by themselves. And it is possible to inspire many of them <br/>\nto feel more supportive of each other and less likely, as a group, to <br/>\ntolerate hurtful behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Remembering that<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve allowed your child to grow and be strong and secure in their <br/>\n&gt; own being and<br/>\n&gt; they won&#39;t allow more behaviours towards them, than they are <br/>\n&gt; benefitting<br/>\n&gt; from.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Group interactions outside the family are different. Several individual <br/>\nchildren may be feeling hurt, but covering it up with bravado or <br/>\nwithdrawing or whatever - and other children may be feeling a bit of <br/>\ndiscomfort but, not communicating that to each other, they don&#39;t stand <br/>\ntogether and make it clear that the meanness is not okay with them. <br/>\nEach thinks it is just them, sometimes. Other times they just don&#39;t <br/>\nrealize that their friends are really being hurt. When a caring and <br/>\nkind adult steps in to encourage and support their best instincts, to <br/>\ndefend their friends from being hurt, for example, and to speak out if <br/>\nthey are not comfortable, that can definitely help the kids handle the <br/>\nproblems. An adult can remind the kids, &quot;If you think your friend&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings are being hurt, remember that they&#39;ll feel better if they know <br/>\nyou didn&#39;t like it and didn&#39;t agree.&quot; Kids might not think about this <br/>\non their own. An adult can say, &quot;If somebody is hurting your friend&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings, you might make things better if you say something like, &#39;Stop <br/>\nit, that&#39;s hurting her feelings,&#39;&quot; Sometimes kids NEED adults to help <br/>\nthem - to help them recognize or articulate things. To help them feel <br/>\nlike they have ways to resolve problems, together, and that they have <br/>\nyour backing, too.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If it gets to hateful, they know they can come home to you.  They know <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; can walk away at any time.  It&#39;s not like they are stuck in a <br/>\n&gt; classroom with<br/>\n&gt; these children or even have to see them every day at school or on the <br/>\n&gt; bus.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These are situations where the kids want to be there, obviously. The <br/>\nanswer isn&#39;t to just abandon them to the group - if they want to be <br/>\nthere they have to put up with whatever since they have the option to <br/>\njust leave. Adults or other kids, for that matter, can help the whole <br/>\ngroup work better for everybody. Lots of times kids just need a little <br/>\nhelp in recognizing what is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the other hand if violence is involved, definitely takes some<br/>\n&gt; intervention, either by strongly suggesting my own children not go <br/>\n&gt; there to play or<br/>\n&gt; somehow removing them from danger.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Waiting until there is violence involved is far more hands-off than I <br/>\nthink we need to be - hurtful behavior, teasing and insulting, is <br/>\ncommon among groups of kids, but we can help them be kinder to each <br/>\nother and they can get the feeling of how NICE it is to play together <br/>\nwhen the insulting and teasing is absent and when tolerance and <br/>\nkindness is the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kids have a way of working things out though.  Almost always.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No they don&#39;t. They often need us to be there for them - leaving them <br/>\nto their own devices is what happens on the school playgrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; harder for the mom to watch and hear from the outside than it is for <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; children sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You seem to think I&#39;m talking about parents stepping in and telling <br/>\nkids what to do or not do:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I know I&#39;ve had days I wanted to just snatch a child up and<br/>\n&gt; make them listen to me as I tell them how NOT to be to my children.  I <br/>\n&gt; almost<br/>\n&gt; always resisted! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And what i was saying was not at ALL about telling individual kids how <br/>\nNOT to be. I think you didn&#39;t get the point. You sound afraid that <br/>\nparents talking to kids will make the kids behave worse or something. <br/>\nThat is not my experience at all. My experience is that parents should <br/>\nbe THERE and that the kids need to know that parents are there and <br/>\nready and willing to help them out. I think lots of kids just want to <br/>\nhave a good time and don&#39;t feel good, themselves, when other kids are <br/>\ngetting their feelings hurt, but they don&#39;t do anything about it for <br/>\nvarious reasons. We can help and inspire those kids who don&#39;t like <br/>\nteasing, much less bullying, to feel strong enough to stand together <br/>\nand defend each other and to create play groups that function the way <br/>\nTHEY want them. It does take a certain attitude on the parents&#39; parts <br/>\nand stepping in with an attitude of blame and of defending only our own <br/>\nchildren and telling kids what to do and what not to do is not at ALL <br/>\nwhat I was talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or - get a group of them together and talk, for just 2 or 3 minutes,<br/>\n&gt; about how great it can be for kids to play together without teasing and<br/>\n&gt; how it is hard sometimes, but very worth it, to work on being good<br/>\n&gt; friends and playmates.

As soon as I saw the kid<br/>\nstrike his &quot;bring it on&quot; pose, I was over there in a second. Joseph had no<br/>\nclue this kid was ready to belt him. I asked the kid if there was a problem<br/>\nand he told me Joseph was lonely!!! I had to actually laugh at that. He was<br/>\nthe one that approached Joseph. I wonder where the kid heard that from?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was over and Joseph had a really hard time understanding why this kid got<br/>\nso mad and wanted to fight. He really had no clue he could get popped for<br/>\nsomething like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen teasing happened after, my kids just really shrug their shoulders and<br/>\nsay they don&#39;t care that the other can run faster, jump higher or answer<br/>\nquestions better. My kids really don&#39;t let that bother them and I can say it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe few times my kids have been bothered, I go over and talk to the<br/>\nchild/children like I would if they were mine. I ask what&#39;s wrong and ask<br/>\nthem to be nicer and let them know they can all play together without<br/>\nteasing over differences. That actually takes care of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it gets bad, my kids just pretty much stay away.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

Those &quot;mean girls&quot;<br/>\n&gt; usually hang out w/ a couple of sweet girls who are nice to my<br/>\n&gt; children, so my girls don&#39;t want to leave and play at home ...  but<br/>\n&gt; those &quot;mean girls&quot;  quiz my girls by asking &quot;What&#39;s 2 X 2?&quot;  and<br/>\n&gt; then if/when my girls answer, the quizzing continues, getting more<br/>\n&gt; difficult, until the time comes that my girls have no answer. It is<br/>\n&gt; so ridiculous but of course, important to my girls.  One particular<br/>\n&gt; girl is very competitive w/ my 7 yr old (who is taller/heavier than<br/>\n&gt; girls her age)  and claims &quot;I can run faster than you&quot;  ...  etc.  I<br/>\n&gt; have responded to that by informing Kaylie that she may run a little<br/>\n&gt; slower but is likely much stronger than that little 7 yr old.   Not<br/>\n&gt; sure if that is the right approach.  Sometimes I wanna run over<br/>\n&gt; there and scream and throw sand in those little &quot;mean&quot;  faces.<br/>\n&gt; ROFL!
