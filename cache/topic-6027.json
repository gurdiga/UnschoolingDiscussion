My oldest son and I were<br/>\n&gt; doing some research on snakes. With my school mindset, I asked him what<br/>\n&gt; questions we need to answer to put together on snakes, thinking of stuff<br/>\n&gt; like what they look like, where they live, etc. HIS questions though, were<br/>\n&gt; why do they have forked tongues, why do they shed their skins, and my<br/>\n&gt; favourite, will they evolve into something else. I love it when he forces me<br/>\n&gt; to think outside of my sometimes narrow framework!<br/>\n&gt; About the siblings - that is a struggle around here sometimes too, although<br/>\n&gt; today when they couldn&#39;t seem to get along I separated them into their own<br/>\n&gt; rooms, and told them I was angry because they weren&#39;t being good friends to<br/>\n&gt; each other. Within a few minutes, my five year old had crept into the three<br/>\n&gt; year old&#39;s room to ask him to play again, then they shouted down the stairs<br/>\n&gt; to me that they were being kind to &quot;our ch&#39;other&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Separation seems a fate worse than any, I guess.<br/>\n&gt; I was just at the Oak meadow site, inspired by what I&#39;ve read on the list,<br/>\n&gt; and if it ever becomes necessary for me to register with a private school<br/>\n&gt; like that, that&#39;s sure the way I &#39;d go. I put in a subscription to the<br/>\n&gt; magazine too - it looks wonderful.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry, too long again - I seem to save up my thoughts then dump them at<br/>\n&gt; once!<br/>\n&gt; Leanne<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FREE ADVICE FROM REAL PEOPLE!
