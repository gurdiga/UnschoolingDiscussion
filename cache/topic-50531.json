I   <br/>\njoined this group on the suggestion from a member of another HS group <br/>\nI am on.  I read 100 messages!  I wanted to respond to every one of <br/>\nthem, but I dutifully &quot;lurked&quot; and waited.  I love the &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\nideas and attitudes that I have seen presented here. I think I have <br/>\nfound my new home!   I have not actually started homeschooling my <br/>\nchildren yet.  I have 4 children, 16, 13, 11, 7..  I am taking the <br/>\nyounger 3 out of a charter school as soon as my HS registration <br/>\narrives in the mail.  Our family is pretty.. hmmm.. I dont <br/>\nknow.. &quot;non traditional&quot;?  &quot;unconventional&quot;?  &quot;eccentric&quot;?  Whatever <br/>\nyou want to call it..  We&#39;re definitely unique, and I wouldnt have it <br/>\nany other way.   Ive been posting and reading on another group that <br/>\nis for HS&#39;ers in my state.  Ive already had a run in on that group <br/>\nwith a lady who personally attacked me (I really never understood <br/>\nwhy) Anyway, hopefully this group is a bit more accepting and open to <br/>\ndiversity.   Here&#39;s looking forward to getting to know everyone <br/>\nbetter.. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50508,"nextTopicId":50539}}
