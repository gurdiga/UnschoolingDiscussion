NOW they&#39;re being jerks because they&#39;re really, really sad. <br/>\nNeither is behavior you&#39;d expect from adults, but it does come from feelings. If <br/>\nyou can keep feeling happy you&#39;re going, and try not to punish them for <br/>\nhaving been jerks, eventually they&#39;ll adjust and stop. They were mostly jerks <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s what they know what to do, and they need and love you. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere in NH are you moving, and from where?<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73744,"nextTopicId":72760}}
