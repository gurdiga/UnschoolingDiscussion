Shoot, we never even <br/>\n&gt; go to the surface unless the rains flood us out!  All we ever do is <br/>\n&gt; crawl around in the stupid ground.  Oh, and how can I forget?  We <br/>\n&gt; eat dirt!  Dirt for breakfast, dirt for lunch, and dirt for dinner!  <br/>\n&gt; Dirt, dirt, dirt!  And look--now there&#39;s even a hair in my dirt!  <br/>\n&gt; The final insult--I can&#39;t stand it any longer!

I eat my <br/>\n&gt; breakfast <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on with cleaning up the living room/dining room area.  Tim sits <br/>\n&gt; &gt; there an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; plays with his food.  I&#39;ve quite hassling him about finishing it <br/>\n&gt; up <br/>\n&gt; &gt; already,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and mornings have become more relaxed.  (Food was has been my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hangup...)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, over the last of his breakfast, Tim was talking about gravity <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; considering what would happen if his &quot;personal gravity shifted&quot;.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Like if he<br/>\n&gt;  was affected differently by gravity, either more or less.  It was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interesting monologue; my input was merely to laugh at the fun <br/>\n&gt; ideas <br/>\n&gt; &gt; he came<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up with, and wonder silently when the heck he learned about <br/>\n&gt; &gt; gravity.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It just occurred to me this evening after he went to bed where he <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; learned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about gravity: Calvin and Hobbs comic books.  So from reading <br/>\n&gt; &gt; cartoons, he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discovered a scientific concept, considered how it affects his <br/>\n&gt; life, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagined how a change of it would change his life.  Not bad for a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; comic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book!  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe I oughta buy him another one.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; brenda<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
