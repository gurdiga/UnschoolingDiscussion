More specifically with symptoms, those that go farther than just hand and wrist pain. Joe and I are trying to make a diagnosis on him as he&#39;s been going on 4 weeks incapacitated with no end in sight. Dr&#39;s seem totally stupid on this one. We&#39;re both beside ourselves as to what to do. He&#39;s trying acupuncture now. Chiropractic didn&#39;t work, pain killers don&#39;t work and I couldn&#39;t find the homeopathic remedy I thought might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62863,"nextTopicId":62761}}
