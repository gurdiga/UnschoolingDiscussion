My sympathies go out to the moderator...and Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnow things: Igloos were one of my favorites, SNOW ICE CREAM . (ingredients: Snow, a little sugar, some vanilla or other flavor. Mix and eat.)<br/>\nSNOW ANGELS, Dog sled? (all you need is the dog and makeshift harness, the fun is hooking the dog up, not if it works or not.)<br/>\nKing of the mountain (you just need a pile, smaller kids only need a small pile, the object is to land in the fluffy snow)<br/>\nAnd if everyone is gathered inside around the stove, anyway, you might as well make some candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my memories of snow were : Stomping around collecting maple sap, cutting firewood, feeding pigs, shoveling snow so the milk truck could get in the driveway, cleaning out the manure spreader which broke because it was frozen, cutting more firewood. All the &#39;fun&#39; farm things.<br/>\n<br/>\nDan C.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. To LInda:  Sometimes the &#39;hunting&#39; bug is actually a &#39;shooting&#39; bug. It took me a few years to realize I just love the machinery of hunting. I am a member of PETA, too (people eating tasty animals), but now that I can afford the time, I choose to raise the animals to eat for myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several gun contests and clubs which are primarily for advancing accuracy and machining skills, rather than hunting animals. The biggest thing to be concerned with is safety and attitude, IMHO. No playing around and no trivializing (Up Nort&#39; dey tend ta do that, y&#39;know). If someone is going to take up a weapon, they need to be focused. Just like driving. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27624,"nextTopicId":27657}}
