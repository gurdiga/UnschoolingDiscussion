Job applications? the next Harry Potter novel? a <br/>\ntechnical manual? the New York Times? What would <br/>\nconstitute &quot;passing&quot;? Based on what? Remember, while I totally agree <br/>\nthat reading is useful in our society, we aren&#39;t measuring our kids <br/>\nagainst any other kids or any hypothetical &#39;average kid&#39;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although, benefits are to some degree subjective<br/>\n&gt; (I do have specific ones for my children), our<br/>\n&gt; culture has clearly defined benefits for educational<br/>\n&gt; outcomes.  I&#39;m simply saying that it would be nice to<br/>\n&gt; have some idea how unschoolers meet these expectations.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Really? What are those clearly defined benefits for educational <br/>\noutcomes? One of the VPs in our company has no college degree. There <br/>\nare plenty of folks with advanced degrees and no job. Is a <br/>\nparticular education outcome a guarantee of anything? If yes, show <br/>\nit. If not, why jump through hoops of someone else&#39;s choosing when <br/>\nyou could be doing what you choose and getting to where you choose <br/>\nto go. One thing you might not have caught onto yet (unless you&#39;ve <br/>\nread through a bunch of the archives here and on other sites) is <br/>\nthat those &quot;expectations&quot; are not something we choose to hold our <br/>\nkids (or ourselves) to. The only expectations my son has to look at <br/>\nare what he expects of himself, not me, not society at large.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think that choosing unschooling simply because it<br/>\n&gt; feels good is a mistake.  Lots of things feel good,<br/>\n&gt; but not all are beneficial in the long term.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm if I had the choice to do something that felt good and ended at <br/>\nthe same place that something that didn&#39;t feel so good, which would <br/>\nI choose? that&#39;s pretty much a no-brainer. Before any of this will <br/>\nmake sense, there needs to be a realization that there&#39;s more than <br/>\none way to anything. Good grades to college to good job are hoops <br/>\nthat lead to someplace BUT there are other ways to good job AND what <br/>\ndefines &#39;good job&#39; is variable. Even employers are finding out that <br/>\nmore money and prestige is not the drawing card it once was. So, if <br/>\na &quot;good job&quot; is variable then the path to get there is also <br/>\nvariable. And if the path is variable, why would one NOT want to <br/>\ntake the one that offers the most joy and pleasure along the way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Better than the approach that I am currently using. Be it<br/>\n&gt; the public schools or eclectic homeschooling. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re looking for better GPAs and SATs then unschooling is <br/>\ndefinitely NOT going to be better than what you are currently doing. <br/>\nAnother analogy (I know I know lol): some chickens are kept in <br/>\ncoops, fed scientifically, medicated, and all their eggs are in one <br/>\nplace and easy to measure and count. Other chickens are free-range <br/>\nchickens. They are given some food and water and peck and hunt for <br/>\nthe rest. They aren&#39;t routinely medicated tomake them bigger or <br/>\nproduce more, just if they get sick. Their eggs are here and there <br/>\nand wherever - sometimes you don&#39;t ever see the eggs even though you <br/>\nknow they are there somewhere because the chicken is healthy and <br/>\nthat&#39;s what healthy chickens do. Same with people. You can pop a <br/>\nchild into a seat, feed them on scientifically designed and approved <br/>\nmaterials for their age, medicate them if necessary to get them to <br/>\nsit still and do the material, and it&#39;s easily quantifiable - x <br/>\nnumber of pages, y exercises correct, etc. My son is a free range <br/>\nboy. There&#39;s stuff he knows that I have no idea about - I didn&#39;t <br/>\nteach it to him. He&#39;ll pop out with a comment along the way that&#39;ll <br/>\namaze me (he was explaining that certain types of armor in a game <br/>\nmake the character invulnerable - he&#39;s 7 - I didn&#39;t know he knew <br/>\nthat word nor the definition of it - no vocabulary lists or <br/>\nquizzes). Just as I&#39;ve collected tidbits along the way and made <br/>\nconnections to other things, he is collecting tidbits and making <br/>\nconnections.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No matter how you look at it homeschoolers are a minority<br/>\n&gt; of the school aged children in the U.S.  Are you saying<br/>\n&gt; that there&#39;s nothing different about unschooling or<br/>\n&gt; children who are unschooled compared to children in public<br/>\n&gt; or private schools?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a LOT different about unschooled kids - but a researcher <br/>\nwould be hard pressed to measure and test and quantify it.

The <br/>\n people DOING it know it works and don&#39;t need studies.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat said, you want measurements and evidence that authentic learning takes  <br/>\nplace. <br/>\nJulian, who is 16, has unschooled since he completed the third grade. To  me, <br/>\nthat means that since he was 7 years old, he has not been forced to read,  <br/>\nwrite, study, or learn anything he didn&#39;t want to. In addition, we do not have  <br/>\nrequired chores, we do not punish, he does not have a bedtime, etc. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy information on Julian is clearly anecdotal rather than scientific,  <br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t have a control Julian. (If we did we&#39;d probably feel sorry for  the <br/>\ncontrol Julian and start unschooling him, so it&#39;d mess up the  research.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe main way all homeschoolers know their kids are learning is they talk to  <br/>\nthem. Even the ones who test and have assignments can tell their kids are  <br/>\nlearning without them. They just worry about it or are required by state  <br/>\nauthorities to test. Julian knows stuff. Lots and lots of stuff. Lots that I  don&#39;t <br/>\nknow. And I&#39;m wicked sharp.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome of the Impressive Stuff that Julian has done:<br/>\n1. When he had just turned 14 he took a Harvard Extension course called  <br/>\nEvolution and Society. He took it because he thought it sounded interesting. He  <br/>\nwas required each week to read 200-300 pages of primary source material  <br/>\nconsisting mostly of pre-Darwin era science and religion writing. Because he had  <br/>\nnot been in school, he was hindered by not having learned to skim long, boring  <br/>\nreading, but he did fine. He had also not spent years learning to write  <br/>\npapers...in fact, when he left school he hated writing and had written almost  <br/>\nnothing until this course. The course required several lengthy argument papers,  <br/>\nwhich we coached him through (the mechanics, not the content--HE knew what  <br/>\nneeded to be in them, we didn&#39;t.) He did the most participating in class  <br/>\ndiscussions. The next youngest student was 21. Most were taking it for graduate  <br/>\ncredit. He earned a B+.<br/>\n2. Julian is a committed musician, and works on his music for up to hours a  <br/>\nday. He takes guitar and voice lessons weekly. He is planning to teach himself <br/>\n to play the bass.<br/>\n3. Julian spent a year and a half working weekly at a local food pantry,  <br/>\neventually training other volunteers. The Director told me that he was the best,  <br/>\nmost reliable volunteer he had.<br/>\n4. This fall Julian got a job as a Coordinator of Religious Education at a  <br/>\nUU church, a job that had been intended for an adult. He plans curriculum,  <br/>\nworship, etc. for the program, and works with many volunteers.<br/>\n5. He is presently taking an online Marine Biology course through the  <br/>\nUniversity of CA at Dominguez Hills.<br/>\n6. He often teaches things like Beginning guitar and making  chainmaille to <br/>\nchildren and adults.<br/>\n7. He writes extremely well, both creatively and more traditional  papers.<br/>\n8. He has become very adept at doing sound for events, and has created an  <br/>\nimpressive sound system for himself. <br/>\n <br/>\nI could go on and on. These things are cool. What we find cooler is that he  <br/>\nhas done these things because he loves to and wants to. He did well in his  <br/>\nHarvard course because he cared about it, not because he suddenly had become a  <br/>\nprodigy. He is also an awesome friend, very kind and caring. He likes his  <br/>\nparents. He has an insatiable desire for learning stuff, in lots of areas.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is different, and there is emotion and faith, as well as reason and  <br/>\nevidence.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n**********************************************************<br/>\nMichael said: &gt;&gt; If unschooling is better, then its students should  somehow  <br/>\nbe<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; measurably different than the general population,  otherwise<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what&#39;s  the point?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Karen  replied:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ~~~<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I laughed right out  loud.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; That IS the point of unschooling.

How does one measure joy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You all seem to believe that unschooling is a better approach<br/>\n&gt; to learning than other types of homeschooling or formal schooling.<br/>\n&gt; If I am considering unschooling as an option then I would like<br/>\n&gt; to see verifiable evidence (other than testimonials) that it <br/>\n&gt; confers some benefit.  Is there a problem?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes - what would constitute &#39;verifiable&#39; evidence? How do you verify <br/>\na life lived with gusto?  \t<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If unschooling is better, then its students should somehow be<br/>\n&gt; measurably different than the general population, otherwise<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s the point?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, what are you trying to measure? You&#39;re not going to find <br/>\nhigher grades, more college degrees, early graduation, taller, <br/>\nfaster, etc. Anecdotal eveidence is all there is when you are <br/>\nlooking at a life being lived. Perhaps in two or three generations <br/>\nwhen there are children of children who have never set foot in a <br/>\nclassroom *involuntarily*, it might be possible to notice general <br/>\ntrends (maybe there will be a visible mushrooming of writers, <br/>\npainters, athletes, who were all unschooled but that isn&#39;t something <br/>\nwe can see in the now). One of the problems of this kind of <br/>\nmeasuring is that you aren&#39;t measuring just one thing as you would <br/>\nwith looking at GPAs or SAT scores. What unschooling looks like is <br/>\nas different as each person, each family, that is living it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis might not be a perfect illustration (and I ask forgiveness <br/>\nahead of time for the comparison I&#39;m about to make) but maybe it&#39;ll <br/>\nhelp: did you ever watch one of the big dog shows (like the <br/>\nWestminster Kennel Club show)? One of the things that they <br/>\nrepeatedly mention when doing best in class judging is that the dogs <br/>\nare not compared to one &#39;perfect&#39; hypothetical dog but to their <br/>\nindividual breed standard - how close is this particular German <br/>\nShepherd a &#39;perfect&#39; example of German Shepherd; this collie to <br/>\nthe &#39;perfect&#39; collie; and so on. The one that is the closest to <br/>\ntheir particular breed standard, wins. Now, to move it to our <br/>\nunschooled kids - rather than being compared to other people <br/>\n(different &#39;breeds&#39;), we are &#39;judging&#39; our kids based on their <br/>\nindividual &#39;breed&#39; and guess what? They are exactly 100% perfect <br/>\nexamples of themselves! Isn&#39;t that wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s why you&#39;ll never &#39;quantify&#39; unschooling - it&#39;s as unique <br/>\nas a fingerprint.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":57459741,"authorName":"Michael Atherton","from":"&quot;Michael Atherton&quot; &lt;athe0007@...&gt;","profile":"athe0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Scientific Studies of Unschooling?","postDate":"1131559669","msgId":109460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrdGR0bCtjdnA4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrdGNtYSthdjZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109458,"nextInTopic":109461,"prevInTime":109459,"nextInTime":109461,"topicId":109418,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
