But I didn&#39;t know that then.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTara was almost 9 when Joseph was born. She was in the 4th grade. Had been<br/>\ngoing to school since she was 4. Aside from being shy and not &quot;social&quot; with<br/>\nthe other children, she did well. Not saying those 1st two things were good<br/>\nfor her but that was when school for me was the only way to go. I knew of<br/>\nnothing else and it was a &quot;great&quot; school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI planned on going back to work when Joseph was 3 months old. My boss was<br/>\ncalling me every day waiting. When he was 2 months old, I knew the doubts I<br/>\nhad since he was born about working were not going away. Fortunately for us,<br/>\nmy husband felt the same way. I had stayed with Tara until I &quot;had&quot; to put<br/>\nher in school. This was a whole new life for me and the kids. Different<br/>\nhusband and a whole different way of living. Over the next year, I saw<br/>\nTara&#39;s spark start to flicker. It was school that was doing it to her. 5th<br/>\ngrade was the start of so much more for her. By 7 & 8th grade, my husband<br/>\nand I were at that school at least once a month. Not because of Tara but<br/>\nbecause of the teachers. But we had made our decision by the time Joseph was<br/>\n2. And by then Sierra was 1.  So we knew we would homeschool really before<br/>\nthe trouble started. We just knew we could raise happier children without<br/>\nschool. We knew our children would learn so much more by being with us most<br/>\nof the time as opposed to strangers with &quot;good&quot; intentions. There was a lot<br/>\nmore to it that strengthened our decision as time went on, but for us there<br/>\nwas just no other way. We couldn&#39;t understand giving our children up to so<br/>\nmany different people at such a young age for such a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] wanting normal","postDate":"1053190864","msgId":69533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDMwMWMzMWM5NiQwMDUxMzUyMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMjEwMWMzMWMxYyRiMGY2NGYyMCQyM2UwYjVkMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":69511,"nextInTopic":69546,"prevInTime":69532,"nextInTime":69534,"topicId":69463,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... their young kids out of public school   when there was no real issues-(ie, bad schools-learning difficulties-reluctance to go-bullying)  other than the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2006189206\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; With over 1000 members on this list is there no one????? who has taken<br/>\n </span></blockquote>their young kids out of public school   when there was no real issues-(ie,<br/>\nbad schools-learning difficulties-reluctance to go-bullying)  other than the<br/>\nconviction that  realxed home schooling ar unschooling was a very positive<br/>\nthing?<br/>\n<br/>\nOur older kids all went to school, but I knew before I even conceived Lars<br/>\nthat he would be unschooled.
