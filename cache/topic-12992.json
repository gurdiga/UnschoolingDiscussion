That&#39;s something like 70 days.  I really want to go tubing in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Hill Country, but I don&#39;t think they have any rivers left down there.<br/>\n(Hey,<br/>\n&gt; Pris -- you&#39;re in San Antonio, aren&#39;t you?  Isn&#39;t there someone else on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; list who&#39;s down round there in the Hill Country?)  Anything you&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; ship down would be greatly appreciated.
