As I heard<br/>\nit, the churches in each New England town were the &quot;town church&quot; so to<br/>\nspeak. It was just where everyone went. At some point an intellectual debate<br/>\non theology broke out over the trinity or unity of God. There were more<br/>\nwealthy, educated -- and, therefore, lawyerly -- types supporting the unity<br/>\ntheory so the Unitarians ended up &quot;winning&quot; the debate and kept the<br/>\nchurches. The Trinitarians had to move out and build their own churches.<br/>\n(Which is why the UUs, though congregations are small, often have the<br/>\nbiggest oldest church in the center of New England towns.) (The Trinitarians<br/>\neventually became the United Church of Christ.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Universalists (in America) were in response to the Calvinist teachings<br/>\nthat who was going to heaven was preordained. They emphasized universal<br/>\nsalvation. (Though it says Unitarian at the website.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how the Unitarian church ties into the Unitarian founded in<br/>\nTransylvania but some how they did get together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt says they were both Christian until the 19th century when beliefs<br/>\ngradually evolved into the &quot;multi-faith&quot; of today. And in 1961 the two<br/>\nchurches merged to form Unitarian Universalist Association.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough there are individual Unitarian and Universalist churches that<br/>\nremained separate from the UUA. And each UU church has a different flavor.<br/>\nIn some churches &quot;God&quot; (the meaning of which is left up to individual<br/>\ninterpretation and may be nondietyish like &quot;interconnectedness of all<br/>\nthings&quot; or nothing at all.) And in some churches God doesn&#39;t get mentioned.<br/>\nAnd some churches will have a particular religious bent like Christian or<br/>\nPagan or whatever though the majority of UU churches tend to be multi-faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good summary of the beliefs held is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As a result, UUs hold diverse beliefs about deity. Within a single<br/>\n&gt; congregation, there will be some individuals who are unsure of the existence<br/>\n&gt; of god(s) and goddess(es). Others believe in no deity, a single deity or many<br/>\n&gt; deities. They hold various views on life after death, including complete<br/>\n&gt; annihilation of the person, some form of afterlife removed from earth, or<br/>\n&gt; reincarnation. They are free to have beliefs that parallel those of<br/>\n&gt; conservative Christians; but few do so. Approximately 10% of UUs consider<br/>\n&gt; themselves to be Christians. These people typically share many beliefs about<br/>\n&gt; Jesus with members of liberal Christian denominations<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the Religious Tolerance webpage isn&#39;t enough for anyone ;-) there a<br/>\nreally good set of questions and answers at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uunashua.org/100quest.shtml\">http://www.uunashua.org/100quest.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2139","postDate":"1025632457","msgId":38881,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWMyMjFmMSQ4NzA1NDY2MCQ3YzgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjU2MjY5MjAuMzg3LjU0ODYubTEyQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38948,"prevInTime":38880,"nextInTime":38882,"topicId":38881,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I m just looking into the UU church but the information the church sent to me is that their","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1534999598\">&lt;&lt;The UU Church is not considered Christian by other Christians. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just looking into the UU church but the information the church sent to<br/>\nme is that their roots are from pre-Constantinian Christianity.
