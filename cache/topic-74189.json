I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>((((((((((Kim)))))))))  How stressful this sounds for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really happy for your family; it sounds like a long-time dream is really<br/>\ncoming true for you, and it also sounds like unschooling is helping you all<br/>\nbe at peace with each other.  That&#39;s wonderful.  Is that selfish?  Not in my<br/>\nbook.  It&#39;s great to care about your parents, and to weigh what they think.<br/>\nBut in the end, you have to do what is going to be right for yourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hasn&#39;t been long since you told them, so time may help smooth things<br/>\nout some.  Perhaps you can work some things out with your in-laws with firm<br/>\nplans.  Maybe they&#39;d feel better if they know that you&#39;re definitely coming<br/>\non the first weekend of every month or something like that.  Agree to call<br/>\nevery week, etc. It sounds like they are panicking and not being reasonable<br/>\nright now.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that you can communicate to both sets of grandparents just how<br/>\nimportant they are to your son, and how hurt he is by their apparent<br/>\nrejection of your choices.  Write it, call them and tell them, whatever it<br/>\ntakes.  Make sure they know that you aren&#39;t going to lie down and put up<br/>\nwith them being hurtful of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone else will have better ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73345,"nextTopicId":73686}}
