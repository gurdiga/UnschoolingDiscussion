Nice for a change (nothing against magic)!  It&#39;s <br/>\na &quot;girl power&quot; film, ala Drew B&#39;s style.  My girls think Drew rocks <br/>\nso it&#39;s a favorite round here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as what happens after marriage, &quot;The Story of Us&quot; with Bruce <br/>\nWillis and Michelle Pfeiffer comes to mind.  Maybe not the greatest <br/>\nmovie, maybe not for your young daughter (?), but it&#39;s kind of a <br/>\nrealistic representation of what happens after marriage FOR SOME OF <br/>\nUS anyway :).  A kind of cute comedy that I think starts with a <br/>\nwedding then goes onto the after wedding aspect is &quot;She&#39;s Having a <br/>\nBaby&quot;.  And I like &quot;Hope Floats&quot;, but it&#39;s more of an after-marriage <br/>\n(divorce) movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast weekend I saw &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; with Jim <br/>\nCarey.

We had just finished watching Ella Enchanted.  She wants to see what life","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2138152913\">Just tonight my daughter said &#39;why to they always end the movie with the<br/>\nwedding?&quot;  We had just finished watching &quot;Ella Enchanted.&quot;  She wants to<br/>\nsee what life after a wedding looks like (Mom and Dad don&#39;t count ;-)<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and I can&#39;t think of a movie that shows<br/>\nthe wedding at the beginning of the movie (except for Shrek II, which<br/>\ndidn&#39;t fit the bill for her.)  Since there was such a great flurry of<br/>\nComfort Movie suggestions, I thought perhaps folks here might have some<br/>\nideas for me -- movies showing life after the wedding.  Oh, my daughter is<br/>\nalmost 6, doesn&#39;t like scary stuff, is OK with lovey dovey stuff, but not<br/>\ntoo grown up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, she really didn&#39;t like the Ella Enchanted movie (although the only<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; problem for her was when Ella had the knife - won&#39;t spoil it, just<br/>\nin case) because she thought the book was soooo much better!  We knew this<br/>\nabout the movie before we started, and during the movie she kept<br/>\ncomplaining to the TV about how it wasn&#39;t really suppose to be this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n--bc--</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100287,"nextTopicId":100024}}
