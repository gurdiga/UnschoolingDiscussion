The two concepts are congruent in a <br/>\nsubconscious way to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Also, posters here have referred to a &quot;mute&quot; point (the legal homonym <br/>\nof  &quot;moot&quot;)  which in combined form nicely captures the idea of being silent <br/>\non a point about which further talk is useless. I had a colleague in financial <br/>\nadministration who used this homonym in meetings and always meant it <br/>\nsincerely, pronouncing it &quot;mute&quot; -- mewt -- and imo using it correctly for his meaning! <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n       Another congruent combination I recall him coining was the word <br/>\n&quot;lax-adaisical&quot; to combine lax and lackadaisical. That one always made me smile.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Anybody know any other word combinations with congruent meaning, from <br/>\nyour own experience? Enjoying this kind of thing is something unschoolers <br/>\nparticularly are good at imo -- just the kind of thing that standardized <br/>\ncurriculum and testing try to stamp out of our lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Btw, I also object to the way testing and standards ignore the <br/>\nimportance of a well developed sense of humor.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I suppose there are a few folks who somehow thrive without a good <br/>\nsense of humor, but it must be a real struggle! &lt;gg&gt;JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90142,"nextTopicId":90095}}
