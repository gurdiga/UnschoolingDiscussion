They ask <br/>\nquestions. They get interested. And the more precocious or verbal the 4 year <br/>\nold is, the more questions or interest they may have. That&#39;s when you need <br/>\nto be prepared to deal with the difficult questions. IMHO it&#39;s best to <br/>\nanswer those questions and requests as simply and honestly as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW my son&#39;s interest in weapons started with the movie Peter Pan.

She encouraged his desire <br/>\nto learn.  Since she knew nothing about guns, she took him to the police <br/>\ndepartment and asked them to answer his questions honestly and directly <br/>\nabout guns.  He wanted to know how they worked and all that.  They answered <br/>\nhis questions, and they were sure to pass on information about gun safety, <br/>\ntoo.  I thought it was a great idea.

My boys were considered problems in school. They <br/>\nweren&#39;t huge behavior problems, but they were always distracting the other <br/>\nchildren in the class because they would complete their work before anyone <br/>\nelse. To the boys, that meant play time and nothing else. The teacher would <br/>\ngive them referrals out of class, make them write sentences, tell them to <br/>\nwait in the hall or go to the office until they could behave. Actually the <br/>\nboys were bored. So, what I did to fend off some of that boredom was to send <br/>\nwork to school with them. I even had it worked out to where they would <br/>\nreceive extra credit for reading an extra book and sharing it in class with <br/>\nthe other students.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that children should be given a chance to express themselves.. And <br/>\nmaybe a child being bored is just thier way of saying that they would like <br/>\nsome attention, or they just need something to interrupt their neuro <br/>\nassociative connection with the boredom they are experiencing at that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy four year old is constantly &quot;in to&quot; things. He goes from one thing to the <br/>\nnext, in this and in that. He just can&#39;t sit down for a minute out of the day <br/>\nunless he is really engrossed in something on television. Other than that he <br/>\nis up and running around as though this was his last moment on earth :) I <br/>\nhave found that I had to adjust my schedule and make it my business to be <br/>\nreadily available for him when he experienced this. I have found ways to <br/>\nbasically keep him &quot;down&quot; some of the time, but I must admit that i am &quot;up&quot; <br/>\nmost of the time. I hope it is okay to say that he basically has me on a <br/>\nschedule. My family tells me that maybe he needs to be on some medication, or <br/>\nmaybe he needs to &quot;have his butt beat&quot; or he needs to be taught some manners. <br/>\nBut that is not the case at all. He is very bright and he is so intuned to <br/>\nwhat he desires. I feel like I should not listen to my family only because <br/>\nfirst of all I don&#39;t believe in spanking a child for being himself. Yes, I do <br/>\nthink sometimes he should be redirected and that is fine. But the negativity <br/>\nI receive from others when it comes to his so-called lack of discipline is <br/>\njust upsetting to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that he is interested in things that I am not necessarily <br/>\nintersted in and I must admit that I do try to divert his attention away from <br/>\ncertain things, such as blood and gore video games, movies, and guns. He is <br/>\nso into what he wants to be in to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said all of this to say...how do you teach a four year old about guns? <br/>\nBlood and gore movies? Blood and gore video games? Dying?
