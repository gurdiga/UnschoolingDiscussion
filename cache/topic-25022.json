I understand<br/>\nyou feel you were slammed in the beginning.  You have made that<br/>\nabundantly clear.   I think it is fair to say that you no longer care if<br/>\nyou are considered an unschooler by this list, you felt rebuffed in the<br/>\nbeginning, you feel that a person coming here for support might get<br/>\nscared away, and a few other things.  While I respect your need to be<br/>\nunderstood regarding these points, I am humbly requesting that you<br/>\nrefrain from defending these key subjects ad nauseum. I&#39;m pretty sure we<br/>\nall understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that anyone who posts any kind of message straying from your<br/>\nagenda, you immediately bring your subjects back to the focus.  For<br/>\nexample, instead of supporting the Eureka post at all, you took a<br/>\ndefensive stance, and when someone else posted a concern (Sparrow, I<br/>\nthink), you immediately shifted the focus back to you.  This seems to be<br/>\na trend.  I would almost call it narcissism, but that might be a little<br/>\nbold.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this isn&#39;t offensive.  I was hoping these posts would kind of<br/>\nblow over.  I would never want anyone to quit posting their opinions,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m hoping you find a way to post new information rather that<br/>\nreiterating the same point over and over.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn peace,<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget E Coffman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You know, you might want to take your own advice just a little.  I<br/>\n&gt; stopped being defensive sometime early Sunday.  I really don&#39;t care<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; you want to call my system of running my household.  What I do care<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; is that if I had been someone truly in need of advice or a place to<br/>\n&gt; feel<br/>\n&gt; comfortable, this would not have been it.  I would have cut and run<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; my TV post got blasted as being dishonest with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nNetZero Platinum<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nSign up in September to win one of 30 Hawaiian Vacations for 2!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.netzero.net/s/signup?r=platinum&refcd=PT97\">http://my.netzero.net/s/signup?r=platinum&refcd=PT97</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25017,"nextTopicId":25040}}
