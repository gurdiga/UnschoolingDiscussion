It is a different approach to reading. There are pages to cut out for sound bingo and word building puzzles. Some parts of it may be a little &quot;schooly&quot; but you can just do it your own way. One of the things that they say is not to say the name of the letter in conjunction with the sound of the letter because it gets so confusing. Just don&#39;t say the name of the letter at all. Point to the letter or ask &quot;What sound does that symbol make?&quot; Example: the letter &quot;y&quot;. When you say the name of the letter, it actually starts with a &quot;w&quot;(why) yet it makes a very different sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has some processing issues, so this approach is better for him if he wants to do it, that is. I think it would be great for any child though.

She is my schoolish <br/>\nchild. &lt;bg&gt;  She begs to do school work daily, hourly!  So we do school work <br/>\na lot.  Workbooks, textbooks, she loves them all!  Her problem, as she <br/>\nstated to me, is, &quot;I like doing this workbook but it gets boring so fast.  <br/>\nDo we have anything else I can do to learn how to read all by myself that&#39;s <br/>\nfun?  Like a game or something?&quot;  She is really focused on learning to read. <br/>\n  She wants to buy the newest Harry Potter book so she can read it all by <br/>\nherself.  (She can read the first set of Bob books with a generous amount of <br/>\nhelp.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince her birthday is coming up, I thought I&#39;d toss some suggestions out to <br/>\nmy family, but I&#39;m at a loss!  We just purchased a new computer, so this one <br/>\nwill go to the girls room once it gets here.  Any ideas of FUN cd-roms we <br/>\nmight try?  Maybe a game or electronic toy perhaps?  She really likes to be <br/>\nable to work independantly but that is difficult with workbooks, since <br/>\nobviously she can&#39;t read the directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked for a clip-on lamp for her bed so she can stay up late at night <br/>\nand &#39;do school work&#39; when she can&#39;t sleep.  That&#39;s in the bag, but what to <br/>\ngo with it??<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of getting her the Think Pad, with a few books to go with it. <br/>\n  We had one years ago when they first came out and they didn&#39;t have much to <br/>\noffer as far as books went.  Now I see they have phonics, math, science, <br/>\neverything!  Do any of your children have one of these?  Any <br/>\nrecommendations?<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk about an unschooler!  This kid wants to do it ALL on her own!  But Mom <br/>\nis stumped!
