Anyway, there was a question posed about <br/>\nunschooling and having some kids who had never spoken a word being <br/>\ndropped off on an island and if left with books they wouldn&#39;t be able <br/>\nto read them.  You all gave some great responses but the following <br/>\nthrew me for a loop....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was Ren who posted that they wouldn&#39;t be able to learn to <br/>\nspeak and a couple of more people agreed.  This kind of shocked me <br/>\ncoming from ya&#39;ll radical homeschoolers!  ROFL...
