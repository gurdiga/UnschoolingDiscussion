So, we just let her, and she would come and get us to show us which level she&#39;d gotten to, or how something worked. She looked a little obsessed (if there is such a thing) by the game. <br/>\nThen she got as far as she wanted to go, and stopped playing. Once or twice in the year and a half since, she has tried it. She learned all she could from it and that was it- now it&#39;s of practically no interest. I could try to put what she learned into educationese, but I&#39;m lazy or too busy learning other things myself.
