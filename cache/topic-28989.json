Do some research of your own.  Understanding the problem may help <br/>\nyou help her address it.  There are things that dyslexics can try <br/>\nthat really help some.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  This is anecdotal: My dh worked with a dyslexic DJ for many <br/>\nyears.  When he had to read anything on-air, he would print it out <br/>\nwith HUGE letters - or scroll it across the computer in huge letters.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Experiment with learning Braille.  The problem can sometimes be <br/>\nin the pathway between the eyes reading and the brain comprehending, <br/>\nBraille takes that out of the equation.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Make sure Hannah understands that asking for help is not <br/>\nadmitting failure. I&#39;m nearly blind without my glasses, asking an eye <br/>\ndoctor for help was not an admission of failure.  Rachel is non-<br/>\nfunctional without her Prozac - asking for help was her only way of <br/>\nnot failing.  Too many people assume that to apply a &quot;label&quot; is <br/>\nlimiting and always bad.

That&#39;s a hard word to spell <br/>\nphonetically.  Obviously she doesn&#39;t yet know that eye is spelled <br/>\ndifferently than I.  Shadoe seems a pretty good phonetic <br/>\napproximation.  Earrings is a hard one unless you know ear.  And maybe she <br/>\npronounces it engs rather than ings.  Short vowels seem to be really hard <br/>\nto differentiate for some kids.  I&#39;m not going to go through the whole <br/>\nthing, but she seems to be getting at least some of the phonics.  If you <br/>\nthink she needs more work in that area and she *wants* to, you might try <br/>\nthe book I recommended, The Road to Reading.  (I remember it was a pretty <br/>\nrigid program, with both reading and writing.  I only followed it loosely <br/>\nwith Lars.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Does that give you an idea of where she is? If not, I&#39;ll try harder to <br/>\n&gt;give you more of a description.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Writing is a whole different skill than reading, though it can give you a <br/>\nclue whether they&#39;ve got the phonics.  What kind of words does she stumble <br/>\non when she reads?  Do you see any pattern?  Another thing to think about <br/>\nis that reading out loud is a very different skill from reading <br/>\nsilently.  You might suggest that she read to herself and just show you or <br/>\nspell out any words she can&#39;t read on her own.  If you do this, *don&#39;t* <br/>\nthen tell her to sound it out.  Just tell her the word.  If she seems <br/>\nwilling, you might tell her some of the other words in the same family, <br/>\nlike all, call, wall, ball, etc., but stop if you get any signals that the <br/>\ninfo isn&#39;t wanted then.  She mostly just needs to focus on what she&#39;s <br/>\nreading at the time.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n********************************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sarah Carothers","from":"&quot;Sarah Carothers&quot; &lt;puddles@...&gt;","profile":"sarahjocarothers","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fzMK1MUTo98vILTaGEsXOL1195Ch6JL7rfk0g-7VTzvKWHTwTlauEVJ5oTB0DujNMC0IP9ce1d6g3cduUuOcRskSmjJhpxbbq5g085Sh9g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: reading late, was: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number  1633","postDate":"1007147647","msgId":29140,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDIwMWMxNzlkMyQyZjI1MDQ2MCQwMjAxYThjMEB6b29vZy5vcmc+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDExMTMwLjExMjMwMC4tNzAwODExLjE1LnJ1bXBsZXRlYXNlcm1vbUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29089,"nextInTopic":29184,"prevInTime":29139,"nextInTime":29141,"topicId":28989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I talked to her about it last night and offered to take her to somebody who might be able to help us find a way to make reading easier for her.
