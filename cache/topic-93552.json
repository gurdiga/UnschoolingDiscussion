They do offer things to our <br/>\nfamily that would be hard to find (class and different play groups <br/>\nect.) Although once they find out that we don&#39;t go to church two <br/>\nthings happen. First we are hounded to go, and when that dosen&#39;t work <br/>\nwe get the silent treatment (nice people). I have NO problem with <br/>\nchurch OR people who go but, I have found through the years that they <br/>\nare the one&#39;s who have the problem with me not going.O WELL!<br/>\n Second My oldest son was given the game perfection for his birthday. <br/>\nI have never seen a game that makes him so nuts he can&#39;t see the <br/>\npieces for the timer, and then he just starts to cry. When he went to <br/>\nkindergarden this was a big problem for his Timed tests or doing <br/>\nthing by the clock you could just see him fall apart. We have put the <br/>\ngame away for now. But it still worries me. He has a uncle that is <br/>\nthe some way he can not see the putting green on the golf course for <br/>\nthe water in front and of corce there goes his ball. I know there is <br/>\nnothing to do for him he needs to work this out for himself. but I <br/>\nneeded to get this of my chest.<br/>\n Thanks for listening Libby</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93545,"nextTopicId":93607}}
