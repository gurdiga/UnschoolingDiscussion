He started showing an interest in reading about 6 <br/>\nmonths ago and although everybody else in our lives has suggested that it is <br/>\nentirely too early to begin. WE DID IT. He enjoys recognizing letters and <br/>\nlearning to write things. It is fun for him to see letters and his name in a <br/>\nnote from Santa.<br/>\nSo, here is where the problems comes in.<br/>\n1. JJ has been marked as &#39;advanced&#39;; I was lucky to have graduated high <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n2. We do not get the support of our family and friends because they think <br/>\nonly &quot;those crazy people you here about&quot; home/unschool their children AND go <br/>\nto church (shreeekk)<br/>\n3. Although I think it is the right thing for my family, I have been known <br/>\nto only see things from my prospective and go blind to the rest of the <br/>\nworld.<br/>\n4. Quite frankly: We are poor!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease offer any advise, suggestions anything would be great. It would be <br/>\nnice to know somebody heres me and understands what I am struggleing with<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie C<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDonï¿½t just search.
