We <br/>\nstarted unschooling too late to take advantage of them,  but we have <br/>\nfound some other things we enjoy.  First off - logic puzzles - and I <br/>\nwon&#39;t even confess that I didn&#39;t know these were math when we started <br/>\nunschooling.  Second, there&#39;s a book called Family Math and now two <br/>\nnew ones - one geared to younger kids and one to older.  These <br/>\ninvolve all kinds of math games and experiments that the whole <br/>\nfamily can do.  For more advanced math,  we are enjoying the Harold <br/>\nJacobs, Algebra, Geometry and Mathematics, A Human Endeavor books.<br/>\nSome unschoolers really like the Key To Series because they are <br/>\nworkbooks that are very self-directed.  There are many other fun type <br/>\nmath books out there - Marilyn Burns writes some like, Math for <br/>\nSmarty Pants.

He has always struggled with math, until I let go and let him<br/>\nchoose what he wanted to do and how long her wanted to do it.  His<br/>\nunderstanding of concepts and foundations began to improve tremendously.<br/>\nLast year, his friends were starting algebra in school and he was anxious to<br/>\ndo algebra also.  I told him I thought he would have a difficult time with<br/>\nalgebra unless he really nailed down working with fractions, decimals and<br/>\npercents, and offered to work with him.  Unfortunately, my sit-down school<br/>\ntime is very limited these days, and right away we both saw he was going to<br/>\nneed a more structured program in order to work on his own.  I ordered a set<br/>\nof self-teaching workbooks, he flew through them, and is very excited about<br/>\nbeginning algebra now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own algebra story is also enlightening.  I struggled bitterly with<br/>\nalgebra (and most math) in high school, and avoided it like the plague in<br/>\ncollege.  When I was 40, I decided to go to nursing school, and had to take<br/>\nentrance exams.  I borrowed a Saxon Algebra book from one of my<br/>\nhomeschooling friends, and spent about 6 weeks reviewing.  And ya know what?<br/>\nIt was kinda fun!  Not lots of fun, but it was like doing crossword puzzles.<br/>\nBut who (except my mother) spends several hours a day, five days a week,<br/>\nnine months of the year, doing crossword puzzles?  (By the way, I did<br/>\nextremely well on those entrance exams, way better than a math idiot like<br/>\nmyself could be expected to do).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Laraine, these are anecdotes, and I think you want more research-based<br/>\nglobal answers.  I don&#39;t know that there are any, and homeschooling is one<br/>\narea where every family has to find out what works comfortably for them.  If<br/>\nunschooling worries you, makes you feel insecure about giving your children<br/>\nthe best you can, then it is not working for you.  But I am sure that you<br/>\nare an insightful enough mother to see what is working best for your<br/>\nchildren and change your approaches when you need to.  Don&#39;t base your<br/>\nhomeschooling or unschooling decisions on what works for others, only on<br/>\nwhat works best for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here is some advice, that I have just advised you to ignore ;-D.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nworry about time frames.  Don&#39;t fall into the trap of thinking, &quot;Oh, my<br/>\ngosh, this child is 10 and doesn&#39;t know how to multiply!&quot;  Or &quot;We have been<br/>\nusing this book, and the children don&#39;t seem to know any more about<br/>\nfractions than they did 3 months ago.&quot;  Change the approach or the program,<br/>\nbut don&#39;t agonize over the wasted time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a word about foundations.  It seems to me, and forgive me if I am<br/>\nmisreading you, that you are concerned about the foundations for math much<br/>\nmore than for English, science or history.  Is this because you yourself<br/>\nfind math more difficult?  You seem to think that the immersion method of<br/>\nlearning will work for the others, but not for math.  But I believe that<br/>\nresearch in education methodology has shown that immersion in ANY subject<br/>\narea works well.  (Too bad most educational institutions ignore this).<br/>\nPerhaps it would be a good idea to think about whether it is your own<br/>\ndiscomfort with math that is driving you to mistrust an unschooling<br/>\napproach.<br/>\n<br/>\nJane</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jeff & Diane Gwirtz","from":"&quot;Jeff & Diane Gwirtz&quot; &lt;jagwirtz@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-Ioqs9ENGIaIXXPYa_A5-crGKw7_CCXLG4TTfz1IJTmHq5onm9asZ-kw-x5znH3HGAUwlQ2c-fG0grdGKM1-mDRHR6Js7Sa4kdqq6Tk6oA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: Unschooling or Eclectic?

Foundations can be <br/>\nimportant,  but what I have discovered is that if the foundation is <br/>\nmissing,  my son can go back and pick it up very quickly because he <br/>\nneeds it and he wants it.  Last year he was really enjoying physics.  <br/>\nThen it got to the point where he realized he needed to back up a <br/>\nlittle bit,  and work on some math to move on.  He even came to me <br/>\nand asked me to refresh his memory about dividing decimals because he <br/>\nneeded it.  He had been &quot;taught&quot;  that earlier, but didn&#39;t remember <br/>\nit because he wasn&#39;t using it.  When I was &quot;teaching&quot; him math,  I <br/>\nalways had to go over the lesson first, because even though we were <br/>\nonly doing 6th grade level math,  I had forgotten most of it - how to <br/>\nmultiply and divide fractions, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow,  he&#39;s starting to talk about going to college and future career <br/>\npossibilities.  We absolutely discuss what foundation will be <br/>\nnecessary for those goals.  In the end though,  it will be his choice <br/>\nwhat he does.  We talk about things like foreign language - how it <br/>\ncan be easier to learn the younger you are and how some colleges <br/>\nrequire it.  We talk about how even though he dislikes writing,  <br/>\nthere&#39;s not a college I know of where he won&#39;t be expected to write <br/>\ncompetently and even take some composition type classes.  My point is <br/>\nthat we make the case for foundation and encourage him to pursue his <br/>\ngoals.  We just don&#39;t force it.  He owns it.  It&#39;s his life and his <br/>\neducation.   Lastly,  we try to instill the sense that it&#39;s never too <br/>\nlate.  How many adults think that they can&#39;t learn an instrument or <br/>\ngo back to college - It&#39;s too late.  It&#39;s never to late to change and <br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2669,"nextTopicId":2761}}
