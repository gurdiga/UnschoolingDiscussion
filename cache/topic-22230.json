July is usually high-80&#39;s and sunny (though last year <br/>\nwe did have a couple of cooler rainy days in the first week of July). <br/>\nMay I ask what event you&#39;re coming here for? We&#39;ve never gone to an <br/>\nSCA event, but I think my son would really like it so I&#39;d be <br/>\ninterested in finding out more.
