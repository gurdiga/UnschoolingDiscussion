We had an<br/>\nold, old library in our town; heaven knows who built it and when, but it had<br/>\n5 floors, but it was split level on EVERY level.  So this little old place<br/>\nhad 9 floors of books, all about 5 or 6 steps apart.  As a teenager I used<br/>\nto walk to the library, grab a stack of books and go hid behind one of the<br/>\npillars between the stacks on the top floor and listen to the rain on the<br/>\nroof above me while I read.

My children find it aggitating.  I would have to agree, to say the least!  They seem to think that children have VERY short attention spans.  Every two seconds (slight exaggeration:) they change topic, scene, everything.  Once they we&#39;re reading a story my kids really like (Click, Clack, Moo...Cows that Type - Hilarious book!).  Right in the middle of the story they switched to something new!  My kids were like &quot;WHAT? Where&#39;s the rest of the story?&quot;  Very annoying.  Reminded me of school &quot;oops there&#39;s the bell, stop everything and go to your next class!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my 5 year old just loves the play on words.  And they have Gwains World - which is alot like the faces on Electrical Company.  Two knights charge at each other with parts of words.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCorina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
