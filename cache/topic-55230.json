The sites are all over and offer <br/>\nmany classes.  We do have money to spend for materials, classes and <br/>\ncomputers but that money of course is tied to testing, work samples <br/>\nand meeting with our &quot;educational specialist.&quot; They have become much <br/>\nmore restrictive and controlling. My daughter was not interested in <br/>\nany of the classes this year, we already have two computers here at <br/>\nhome and I wanted to follow a more traditional approach to subject <br/>\nmatter so we have not used hardly any of our budget for curriculm <br/>\nmaterials. So, no they have not contributed much to our home <br/>\nschooling environment except pressure to produce work samples and <br/>\nlearning records that meet &quot;their&quot; (i.e. California standards) <br/>\nsubjective ideas. I was also asked to sign a statement that my child <br/>\nwould participate in the SAT 9 testing with the understanding that if <br/>\nwe refused to test that our enrollment in the charter next fall would <br/>\nbe at risk.  BLACKMAIL!!!  All of this is why I feel ready to jump <br/>\nship.  I have been doing so much reading about my rights in Calif. <br/>\nand what we can do.  Then last night I went to the California <br/>\nDepartment of Education website and the information there scared the <br/>\nyou know what out of me!  Those of you in California let me know how <br/>\nyou did it and what has happened, if anything. I feel vey alone and <br/>\nworrried about doing the right thing now and in the future for my <br/>\ndaughter. What if she decides she wants to go to high school in a few <br/>\nyears?  Will it be hard for her to get in?  Anyone been through that <br/>\nissue?  I love this site.  You are all so involved and helpful.  <br/>\nThanks so much from the &quot;newbie.&quot;  Sara<br/>\n<br/>\nIn <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Heidi <br/>\n&lt;bunsofaluminum60@h...&gt;&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey Sara!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What charter school are you with? we&#39;ve been in Idaho Virtual <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Academy <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this year, using the K12 curriculum.
