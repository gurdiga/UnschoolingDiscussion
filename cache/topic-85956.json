I was just thinking this morning how different things would be if the<br/>\nkids were schooled.

It was<br/>\nreally sweet and loving.<br/>\n<br/>\n Today Jess was outside in just a pair of shorts (summer here) pretending to<br/>\nbe &quot;Madman&quot;. He has just seen some of the Hulk so he has been Hulk for the<br/>\nlast few days but now has revolved (his word!) into Madman.&lt;g&gt; He was out<br/>\nthere totally oblivious to everything and having a wonderful time. It was<br/>\n9am and most of the kids in town would have been starting school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jess was little he used to go for days pretending to be Postman Pat or<br/>\nFireman Sam now he still does that but he&#39;s Madman or Black Murray. (I think<br/>\nwatching XMen and The Wiggles makes for very interesting imaginative play.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;) I love the fact that he is still free at nine to be himself (or someone<br/>\nof his own choosing!).
