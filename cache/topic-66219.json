Personally, I&#39;d rather snuggle up to sleep than cry<br/>\nmyself to sleep, and I&#39;m sure that babies feel the same way. Sleeping with<br/>\nbabies is a good way to let them know we&#39;re there with them whenever they<br/>\nneed us, day or night. My son never slept through the night as a baby or<br/>\ntoddler. I even checked Ferber&#39;s book out of the library on sleep training<br/>\nand read through all his assertions that babies *need* to learn how to go to<br/>\nsleep on their own or they&#39;ll *never* learn (sound familiar in a schooled<br/>\nsociety?). But I never could let my son cry it out, though he woke every<br/>\nhour to nurse. Suddenly at age 2.5, he started sleeping through the night<br/>\nand has done so ever since. Like everything, kids will do it when they&#39;re<br/>\ndevelopmentally ready. He&#39;s such a sound sleeper now you can&#39;t wake him up<br/>\nfor anything! So much for needing to be taught... I&#39;d say just bring your<br/>\nbaby in bed with you and when she awakes, comfort or nurse her. She&#39;ll grow<br/>\nout of it soon enough.

I found that my sling was really helpful when my<br/>\nsecond baby was born - I kept her in it for a lot of the day so that she<br/>\ncould just be with me whatever I was doing with my son. It gave me a lot<br/>\nmore time and freedom to concentrate on doing things with him because she<br/>\nwas just right there with me and could nurse or whatever.

Wow, getting through all of these emails is quite a job! I am exhausted and my head is spinning from the last couple of months of reading all of your great opinions and knowledge. Now, I must admit when I first came to your group I was totally floored and very skeptical about my own abilities to do this and about the nature of unschooling itself. So, here I am three months later still reading and still learning so much and I have to say that I am so glad that I stayed. So as I am going along now I think of you all often. I have noticed that it is really not in the &quot;schooling&quot; issues that I think of you all but in the &quot;parenting&quot; issues and I think that that is a good thing, I am redirecting my attention because I think the reality is that unschooling is a philosophy that works it&#39;s way into every  faucet of family life. So, here are a couple of issues that my family is having and I am looking for some discussion on these issues with regard to personal experience and how they fit into the &quot;unschooling&quot; philosophy. Alright, my two year old has decided to destroy her 5 month old sister. From sun up till sundown she is on a mission. With every attempt I try to calmly explain to her that in this house nobody hurts anybody else, mommy doesn&#39;t hurt Sadie (the 2 year old) and Sadie shoudlnt hurt Nora (the baby). She often laughs at me and returns to the game of pummeling again soon after. I know this is probably just a stage but my inclination is to time her out and tell her no no and I am trying to look at it from a different lense. Maybe there is something here that she needs and I need to figure that out and work on that? Ok, issue number two is that my 5 month old won&#39;t sleep through the night. I know,. I know, what 5 month old will? My approach with Molly and Sadie was to let them kind of fuss themselves to sleep by now but tonight when I laid her down and she cried I just couldnt help but second guess myself and wonder if this was really the way to do it/ So I am looking for some advise there and lastly my 10 year old I have written about before. She is my dd from a previous relationship that ended pretty much at birth. It has been a stressful relationship ever since and he is dead set against homeschooling (never mind unschooling which I havent even mentioned) I am at a lose with her. I feel like if anyone could benefit from unschooling it would be her but I am afraid to lose custody of her and I am just afraid of the fight that will go along with pulling her out. Now when she comes home with poor grades my reactions are so different, she knows that I think school is a joke and so she is co0nfused and I just don&#39;t know what the best thing to do for her is! I am so sorry to post such a long post, but here it is! I look forward to hearing advise and experience from some great mothers and fathers out there!
