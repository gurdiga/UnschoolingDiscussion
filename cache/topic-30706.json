I wanted to<br/>\npoint out Helen Hegener&#39;s &quot;Publisher&#39;s Note&quot; article on page 6 to this list.<br/>\nIt touched my heart and spoke to the point we&#39;ve recently discussed about TV<br/>\nand ambition and life goals, etc., though it didn&#39;t mention any of those<br/>\nthings specifically.  :-)  I also especially liked the article &quot;Confessions<br/>\nof an Unsuccessful Homeschooler&quot; on page 39 as I think it addresses the<br/>\nfears of many homeschoolers--particularly new-ish unschoolers.  And that&#39;s<br/>\nwhere I stopped yesterday...will be reading the rest of the issue this<br/>\nafternoon w/ tea.  Great stuff as usual from Home Education Magazine.<br/>\nThanks Helen and Mark and all the contributing writers!<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Moyer / Oklahoma<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30698,"nextTopicId":30673}}
