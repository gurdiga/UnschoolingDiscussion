Your son can have a web site<br/>\nwithin minutes at BlogSpot --and it is free. If he needs more control<br/>\nover the templating, he could pay for it there or try the different pay<br/>\nstructures at TypePad. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy use blogging software to create a web site? The technology behind<br/>\nblogs is very versatile and powerful. It&#39;s based on templates and once<br/>\nyou have the structure and design of your site in place, you don&#39;t have<br/>\nto worry about anything else --inputting text is like writing an email<br/>\non Yahoo!Mail. <br/>\n<br/>\nI use this technology for creating websites, to setting up online<br/>\ncommunities and even Amazon stores.
