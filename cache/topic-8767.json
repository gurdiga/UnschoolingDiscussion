Many people don&#39;t realize that is on doctor&#39;s lists for<br/>\nsevere allergic reactions.  I&#39;m allergic, however I have an anaphalactic<br/>\nreaction (can&#39;t breathe, total body rash, etc).  There are other reactions<br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the case, elimination is definately the way to go.  Especially if<br/>\nthe reactions are getting worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n<br/>\nAlyssa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Figuring out what triggers allergies has been one of my biggest parenting<br/>\n </span></blockquote>challenges yet. My 4 year old&#39;s reaction to things is a rash all around her<br/>\nmouth. She recieves no dairy or nuts (2 products that I know set her off)<br/>\nand she still breaks out quite often. Sometimes the reaction is so delayed I<br/>\ncan never pinpoint the food.  -Amy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8766,"nextTopicId":8768}}
