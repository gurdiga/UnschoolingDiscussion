I <br/>\nknow this family well, and a couple of them may use it as an <br/>\nopportunity to make me look bad. I know this from past experiences. <br/>\nSo I may just go with the flow completly or I may go to the room for <br/>\na while and join the b-day party later.  It is an 80th b-day after <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nBabysitting is  not a problem because the ages of our kids are: 16, <br/>\n14 (almost 15), 12, 9 and 3.  We will just have to reserve two <br/>\nadjoining rooms to accomoate us all, and maybe an ice chest for <br/>\ndrinks and snacks and we&#39;ll get some fast food for dinner.  Hopefully <br/>\nthere will be something for them to watch on the hotel movie <br/>\nchannel.  I&#39;ll make it fun for them. As for getting together with <br/>\ntheir cousins who are around their age... my girls love the younger <br/>\nones, but the older ones are different than them.  These older girls <br/>\nsneek out at night, the 16 year old dates a 19 year old, and think <br/>\nit&#39;s cool that their friend attends a boarding school where she can <br/>\nsneak her boyfriend in to spend the night. I do not worry about this <br/>\ninfluencing them in anyway, it just bugs me.  Their older brother <br/>\ncommitted suicide a few years ago.  It is just different than us. <br/>\nIt is too bad too, because when the older ones were kids, we would <br/>\nvacation together and they got along great and had a wonderful time <br/>\ntogether. Now I&#39;m getting off the subject, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks for all your views on the matter.  I will turn this <br/>\ninto something fun for them and keep a positive outlook!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38170,"nextTopicId":38205}}
