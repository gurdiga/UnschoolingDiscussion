We also just recently reformatted our<br/>\ncomputer, thanks to a dear friend who is an &quot;official&quot;<br/>\ntype computer expert.  We had not yet reloaded our<br/>\nNorton Systemworks on the computer after the reformat.<br/>\n However, I do not seem to be getting any return<br/>\nemails from myself, or any more from anyone else<br/>\nbesides the first three.  I also have not heard anyone<br/>\nsay that they are getting any from me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if it is my ISP that screens it for me,<br/>\nor yahoo (my mail server) or something else our friend<br/>\nmight have put on our computer, but I appear to be<br/>\nvirus free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to comment on how interested I was in<br/>\nfollowing the whole SCA thread.  We just recently got<br/>\ninvolved with communicating with the SCA folks in the<br/>\nSeattle/Federal Way area, as we are moving there in a<br/>\nfew months.  I am working on the whole business of<br/>\ntrying to create fun personas for hubby and me that<br/>\nrefelct our tastes and interests.  We are planning on<br/>\ndoing some events and some camping this summer/fall.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe SCA is also holding their &quot;Arts and Sciences<br/>\n(Symposium or Conference, can&#39;t remember which it is<br/>\ncalled) of the Known Worlde&quot; in Seattle this October,<br/>\nand there will be lots of opportunities to learn and<br/>\ngain new/old skills from the talented people<br/>\npresenting.  I have already got my hands on the lesson<br/>\nplan from a lady who will be presenting a class on<br/>\nhistorical midwifing practices, since the persona I am<br/>\nworking on is sort of a hedge witch/herbalist/midwife<br/>\nkind of thing.  Like Strega Nona, only not so old! <br/>\nLOL  I also got some book recommendations for her, for<br/>\nresearch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is what we are working on right now, besides<br/>\npacking, selling our house, finding work, etc.  %-/<br/>\nHow about you?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
