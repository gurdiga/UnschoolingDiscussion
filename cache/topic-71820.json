She was saying something about one of the camp counselors <br/>\n&gt; calling him her boyfriend and that lead into a discussion about kissing, <br/>\n&gt; holding hands, sex, etc.  She started to get really uncomfortable so I <br/>\n&gt; lightened the subject up with a lot of humor and she felt more relaxed so we <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; kept talking.  At one point we were discussing them sleeping alone in the <br/>\n&gt; shed together and I talked to her about boys, in general, putting the moves <br/>\n&gt; on girls when they aren&#39;t ready and how things can get out of hand so fast <br/>\n&gt; that you don&#39;t even *want* to say no anymore.  I shared some of my past <br/>\n&gt; experiences with her and regrets and mistakes I made.  We were laughing <br/>\n&gt; lightly and really having a great bonding moment.  Then I pop off and say <br/>\n&gt; something along the lines of &#39;hormones and penises make boys crazy&#39; and I <br/>\n&gt; thought she was going to fall out of the car!  She died laughing and I made <br/>\n&gt; a quick recover that there are girls out there like that too and went on to <br/>\n&gt; explain.  She was totally and completely shocked that I said that.  Her face <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; was bright red and she kept saying MOOOUUUUMMMM!!!!!  It was so funny! LOL  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most of the coinversations Julian and I have had about sex, especially when <br/>\nhe was younger, took place in the car. We could chat but there didn&#39;t need to <br/>\nbe a lot of eye contact, which was easier on both of us. I think particularly <br/>\nof a conversation about wet dreams (an old boyfriend told me once when he had <br/>\nhis first he was terrified. He had cool, liberal parents, but it never occurred <br/>\nto them to warn him. So I wanted to be sure to talk to Juls well before).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a great Malcolm in the Middle where Lois was concerned Malcolm <br/>\nmight be having or thinking about having sex. She sets up this long car ride, then <br/>\ninforms him they&#39;re going to talk about sex. She tells him she has no idea <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s going to need to know, so she&#39;s just going to tell him everything. He <br/>\nis horrified.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe starts talking about her own experiences and feelings, and there are <br/>\nscenes of her stopping the car so he can get out and throw up, then getting back <br/>\nin and saying, &quot;Okay,&quot; etc.  Finally they arrive home and pull into the <br/>\ndriveway. They are so engaged in conversation, back and forth, that they just sit in <br/>\nthe car and continue to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71743,"nextTopicId":71825}}
