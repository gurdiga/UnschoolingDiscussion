(My husband is 6 ft. 8 in.)   Look for their stretch jeans in a relaxed fit.  They really do stretch.  Also Old Navy told me that their boys jeans are bigger around than the girls. ( I&#39;m not wild about the expectations that started these differences).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nSuzanne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Shyrley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 15, 2003 8:19 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Need help unschooling food...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary Bianco wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; You can&#39;t possibly tell me that there aren&#39;t other mothers out there with<br/>\n  &gt; the same problem of finding clothes to fit the kids right. Someone should<br/>\n  &gt; start a new line. Clothes for the kids that are real small around and tall.<br/>\n  &gt; And clothes for the kids that are a little thicker around the middle and<br/>\n  &gt; shorter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can relate to this. Heather is tall and skinny. Trousers (pants that are the right length just slide right down, and if we get them so they fit her waist, they are flapping 3 inches above her ankles.<br/>\n  The boys are the same only less tall.<br/>\n  We have had more of a problem here in America where chilcdren&#39;s clothes (we&#39;re talking Target and Walmart here - not some designer store) are just too wide. Americans aren&#39;t a different shape from us.<br/>\n  My next rant will be on the fact that when you go to look for winter clothes in January, all the summer stuff is in. Since when do people buy kids clothes 6 months in advance!!!!!<br/>\n  Grrrrrr<br/>\n<br/>\n  Shyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
