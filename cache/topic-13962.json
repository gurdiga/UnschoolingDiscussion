Because asbestos makes you bleed more...if you bleed more, you re going","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1086762356\">Have you heard that tampon makers include asbestos in<br/>\ntampons? Why would they do this? Because asbestos makes you bleed <br/>\nmore...if you bleed more, you&#39;re going to need to use more. Why isn&#39;t <br/>\nthis against the law since asbestos is so dangerous? Because the <br/>\npowers that be, in all their wisdom (not), did not consider tampons <br/>\nas being ingested, and<br/>\ntherefore wasn&#39;t illegal or considered dangerous. <br/>\nA woman getting her Ph.D. at University of Colorado,<br/>\nBoulder sent the following: &quot;I am writing this because women are not <br/>\nbeing informed about the dangers of something most of us use -- <br/>\ntampons. I am taking a class this month and I have been learning a <br/>\nlot about biology and women, including much about feminine hygiene.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently we have learned that tampons are actually dangerous (for <br/>\nother reasons than TSS). I&#39;ll tell you this, after learning about <br/>\nthis in our class, most of the females<br/>\nwound up feeling angry and upset with the tampon industry,<br/>\nand I for one, am going to do something about it. To start, I want to <br/>\ninform everyone I can, and email is the fastest way that I know how. <br/>\nHere is the scoop: Tampons contain two things that are potentially <br/>\nharmful: Rayon (for absorbency), and<br/>\nDioxin (a chemical used in bleaching the products).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tampon industry is convinced that we, as women, need bleached<br/>\nwhite products -- in order to view the product as pure and clean.<br/>\nThe problem here is that the dioxin produced in the<br/>\nbleaching process can lead to very harmful problems for a woman. <br/>\nDioxin is potentially carcinogenic (cancer-associated) and is toxic <br/>\nto the immune and reproductive systems. It has also been linked to <br/>\nendometriosis and lower sperm counts for men -- for both, it breaks <br/>\ndown the immune system.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast September the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported <br/>\nthat there really is no set &quot;acceptable&quot; level of exposure to dioxin <br/>\ngiven that it is cumulative and slow to disintegrate. The real danger <br/>\ncomes from repeated contact (Karen Hopper &quot;Pulling the Plug on the <br/>\nTampon Industry&quot;). I&#39;d say using about 4 - 5 tampons a day, five days <br/>\na month, for 38 menstruating years is &quot;repeated contact,&quot; wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nyou?<br/>\n<br/>\nRayon contributes to the danger of tampons and dioxin<br/>\nbecause it is a highly absorbent substance. Therefore, when fibers <br/>\nfrom the tampons are left behind in the vagina (as usually occurs), <br/>\nit creates a breeding ground for the dioxin. It also stays in a lot <br/>\nlonger than it wouldwith just cotton tampons. This is also the reason <br/>\nwhy TSS (toxic shock syndrome) occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES? Uing feminine hygiene products that aren&#39;t <br/>\nbleached and that are all cotton. Other feminine hygiene<br/>\nproducts(pads/napkins) contain dioxin as well, but they<br/>\nare not nearly as dangerous since they are not in direct contact with <br/>\nthe vagina. The pads napkins need to stop being bleached, but <br/>\nobviously tampons are the most dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what can you do if you can&#39;t give up using tampons? Use tampons, <br/>\nthat are made from 100% cotton, and that are UNBLEACHED. <br/>\nUnfortunately, there are very, very few companies that make these <br/>\nsafe tampons. They are usually only found in health food stores. <br/>\nCountries all over the world (Sweden, Germany, British Columbia, <br/>\netc.) have demanded a switch to this safer tampon, while the US has <br/>\ndecided to keep us in the dark about it. In 1989, activists in <br/>\nEngland mounted a campaign against chlorine bleaching. Six weeks and <br/>\n50,000 letters later, the makers of sanitary products switched to <br/>\noxygen bleaching (one of the green methods available). (MS magazine, <br/>\nMay/June 1995.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT TO DO NOW: Tell people. Everyone. Inform them. We are being<br/>\nmanipulated by this industry and the government. Let&#39;s do<br/>\nsomething about it! Please write to the companies:<br/>\nTampax (Tambrands), Playtex, OB, Kotex. Call the 800 numbers listed <br/>\non the boxes. Let them know that we demand a<br/>\nsafe product - ALL COTTON UNBLEACHED TAMPONS.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n<br/>\nKandy<br/>\n<br/>\nWork at home - free info: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zibgib.com/grab.html?4891-4\">http://www.zibgib.com/grab.html?4891-4</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13990,"nextTopicId":13995}}
