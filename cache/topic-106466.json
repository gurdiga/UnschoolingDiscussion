I<br/>\nnever drank much...probably less than once a<br/>\nweek....the reaction <br/>\ngradually<br/>\ngrew worse over the years until I had a very scary New<br/>\nYears after one <br/>\nsmall<br/>\nglass of Champagne a few years back.  Anyone ever hear<br/>\nof such a <br/>\nreaction?<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to look it up and I can&#39;t seem to get much.<br/>\nThe &#39;experts&#39; <br/>\nsay<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t an allergy to alcohol and it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nmatter what kind <br/>\nit<br/>\nis...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would not surprise me in the least. In my own<br/>\nHUMBLE opinion, and I am NOT a medical doctor nor do I<br/>\never plan to be... alcoholism is related to an<br/>\nallergic response to sugars, yeast, and alcohol, aka<br/>\nCandida. I say this having been on a strict<br/>\nanti-candida diet until childbirth, then eating &<br/>\ndrinking everything for 12 years: (sugar, cheesecake,<br/>\nred wine, yum yum) while running a low grade vaginal<br/>\nyeast infection that SUDDENlY with no warning turned<br/>\ninto a major one, and both of them being very<br/>\nresponsive to changes in diet. Also I&#39;ve had all of<br/>\nthe other symptoms of candida, one of which is<br/>\ndizziness, various symptoms mimicking alcohol<br/>\nintoxication. The medical community is a long way from<br/>\nacknowledging any relationship here, but they cannot<br/>\nconvince me there is none, I know differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found, re everything, that everyone has<br/>\ndifferent tolerances for different substances (both<br/>\nlegal, illegal, organic, and chemical) and the only<br/>\nway of knowing what is best is trial & error. In<br/>\ngeneral I feel children should be allowed to grow to<br/>\nadulthood before experimenting with substances,<br/>\nprescribed or otherwise, but I have found great<br/>\nbenefit from prescribed medications.<br/>\nAnna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDiscover Yahoo! <br/>\nHave fun online with music videos, cool games, IM and more.
