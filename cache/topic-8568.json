Two of <br/>\nthose years were with Americorps.  I have come to realize that my <br/>\nviews of what education should be are not congruent with the current <br/>\nsystem.  This comes as no surprise.  However, I have found that my <br/>\nwork (and other&#39;s work)in attempting to create changes in education <br/>\nwhich will better serve our nation&#39;s children has been squelched by <br/>\nthe political machine which controls our public school system.  I <br/>\nwill continue to attempt to reform education through the ballot as a <br/>\nmember of a political party, but I also want to work in an <br/>\nenvironment towards achieving a better education system for our kids -<br/>\n a sytem which teaches them civic responsibility; how to resolve <br/>\nconflict peacefully; how communities function; how science, <br/>\ntechnology, and math relate to real life and society, not abstract <br/>\nproblems that have no context to &quot;the real world&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe teach a person how to drive by placing them in a car and guiding <br/>\nthem.  Our public schools are about placing people in a box and <br/>\ngiving them commands every ten minutes.  Sounds to me more like <br/>\npreparing them for the assembly line than to be an individual working <br/>\nto improve the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I ask if anyone here knows of progressive schools in the <br/>\nPortland, OR area in which I may be a positive contribution by carry <br/>\nout my work in education and curriculum development.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSeamus T.
