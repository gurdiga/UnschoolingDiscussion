That night I lay in bed terrorized by the prospect of <br/>\n<br/>\nfailure again. I couldn&#39;t sleep and got up to tell my grandparents <br/>\n<br/>\nthat I felt guilty for buying a craft I might never complete. It was <br/>\n<br/>\nafter 11 p.m. My grandfather got out of bed and said, &quot;Let&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\ncomplete it right now.&quot; I was shocked! He said, &quot;This is important <br/>\n<br/>\nto you and I&#39;ve got the time to help.&quot; We worked on it for several <br/>\n<br/>\nhours into the night and I kept that little project for years as a <br/>\n<br/>\nreminder that with help, I could complete projects. I was cured. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten up at night sometimes when a kid needed something, but never that <br/>\nwonderfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI happened to be up the other night because I couldn&#39;t sleep, and Marty had <br/>\ncramps in his leg in his sleep and wasn&#39;t waking up, so I woke him up because <br/>\nhe was whimpering and twitching, and helped him stretch his leg.  I was <br/>\nREALLY <br/>\nglad, then, that I had been up at 4:00 a.m.  Before that it seemed dumb and <br/>\nwrong to be up, but sometimes up is better whether we know it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79663,"nextTopicId":79574}}
