Does anyone limit or restrict books their <br/>\n children read? I ask this because my Mom always kept a fairly good <br/>\n eye on what I read as a child.(until I was about 14 or so.)For<br/>\n example, when I was about 11 I wanted to read `The Thornbirds&#39; and <br/>\n when I was about 12 the book in question was Steven King&#39;s `It&#39;, and <br/>\n she wouldn&#39;t let me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the question...NO, I do not censor anything they choose to read.  If I <br/>\nnoticed them picking up something that was far beyond their emotional skills, <br/>\nI would definitely dialogue with them and point out what I thought might <br/>\nupset them.  But only if I thought it would be upsetting or difficult for <br/>\nthem to deal with. <br/>\nI read &quot;It&quot; and many other horror stories as a youth. I thoroughly enjoyed <br/>\nthem and continued to read some into my 20&#39;s. Now I find them a bit too <br/>\ndisturbing most of the time and choose drama/thriller type stuff for my <br/>\noutlet, but not horror.<br/>\nMy mother never censored any of our reading. She was very adamant that it was <br/>\nimportant for kids to read whatever they want to. She saw books with high <br/>\nsexual content in my room sometimes even, and never said anything.<br/>\nShe bought us loads of comic books, and even read them with us.<br/>\nWhere did this lead? Well, every one of her children (even the one in prison) <br/>\nare avid readers. All of us write for pleasure, my brother is a damn good <br/>\npoet/rap artist even with all his problems.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think school gave us this intense love for books, reading and <br/>\nwriting. I have to attribute it to my Mom on this one.<br/>\nMy personal feelings are to not to stop a child from reading anything they <br/>\nare interested in, but to keep up the trust between parent and child to where <br/>\nthey feel perfectly comfortable talking with you about issues that may arise <br/>\nin literature that they need deeper understanding about.<br/>\nI read books that scared me and made me uncomfortable, but it didn&#39;t damage <br/>\nme as far as I know.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37297,"nextTopicId":37285}}
