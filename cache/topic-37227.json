Can I ask you to think about this,<br/>\nthough: what&#39;s wrong with him being bored?  He will learn, eventually, that<br/>\nthe baby *has* to have attention, and often cannot wait.  If you ignore his<br/>\nboredom (when necessary!  not constantly, of course.), he will either learn<br/>\nto ammuse himself or learn patience waiting for you to have time to play<br/>\nwith him.

It gets constant attention<br/>\nfor awhile, and then ignored.  So I move it back and put something else in<br/>\nthe living room.  Also, have you ever tried putting some of the stuff away<br/>\nin a closet for awhile?  Personally, I get overwhelmed by too much stuff and<br/>\ndon&#39;t deal with any of it.  Maybe your child is the same way.  I keep about<br/>\nhalf my stuff (and my son&#39;s!) put away at any given time, and pull something<br/>\nout and put something else away about once a week.  It helps limit the<br/>\nclutter, too.
