My SIL works diligently to extend her children&#39;s<br/>\nimmaturity and has been fairly successful.  She controls their lives almost<br/>\ncompletely, even as young teens, (including food, friends, media use, any<br/>\nand all activities), and intervenes consistently so they rarely experience<br/>\npositive or negative consequences when they do venture out into their own<br/>\nlives. They have little responsibility and a tremendous amount of leisure<br/>\ntime and playthings.   Emotionally, they are about equal to my 8yo.
