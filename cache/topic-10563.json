I don&#39;t think you have to <br/>\nwait to help other mothers or even do something as formal and time-consuming <br/>\nas volunteering regularly in a teen mothers&#39; home. If people are looking for <br/>\nguidance, they will join a group, like La Leche or a playgroup, or attend a <br/>\nmom-and-tot type program. Sometimes they just turn up at the park, longing <br/>\nfor another mom to talk to. You can do a lot just by being an experienced <br/>\nmother and a good listener. Just by modeling patient, loving, responsive <br/>\nparenting, sympathizing with their woes by telling stories about how you <br/>\nsurvived sleepless nights or nursing strikes or the terrible twos, you can <br/>\ngive younger moms confidence and hope and an example to follow. I have <br/>\nlearned a lot in situations like this, as a new mom. And in turn, I have <br/>\ntried to offer suggestions -- when asked -- and model the type of parenting <br/>\nI believe in when I&#39;m in those situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI applaud your urge to help others, and I have a feeling that just by being <br/>\nyou and taking your children out in public, you are doing more good than you <br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10638,"nextTopicId":10651}}
