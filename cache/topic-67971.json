Instead of encouraging me <br/>\nby giving me more appropriate books to read, I was sent home with a report <br/>\ncard that said *reads too much*  Luckily, my best friend&#39;s mom was a school <br/>\nteacher in another district and *she* (not my mom!) went to my teacher and <br/>\nchewed her out!! I remember her saying &quot;How do you expect these kids to learn <br/>\nanything if you&#39;re not encouraging them to read!!&quot; Same woman made sure I had <br/>\n*appropriate* reading materials to bring to school.  <br/>\n diana,<br/>\nThe wackiest widow westriver...<br/>\nâ€œI&#39;m just a human being trying to make it in a world that is very rapidly <br/>\nlosing it&#39;s understanding of being human&quot; John Trudell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68011,"nextTopicId":67964}}
