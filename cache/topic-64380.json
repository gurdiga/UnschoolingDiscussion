I don&#39;t think you have to have too many rules<br/>\nexxcept for safety and health rules.  I think it is<br/>\nmean to limit things (tv, computer, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think school is pretty much mean too &#39;cause people<br/>\nmake you do things you don&#39;t want to, I think school<br/>\nshould be fun.&quot; (she went to school for 1st grade,<br/>\nloved it cause she had a COOL teacher and lasted 2<br/>\nmonths of 2nd grade)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe paused, there was a silencen then she said:<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;They (coercive parents) just treat them (their kids)<br/>\nany old way like a ragdoll and I think that is very<br/>\nmean.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTed, 6, said,<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about spanking...here&#39;s a pen,<br/>\nlet&#39;s enter the Hot Wheels contest, what&#39;s your email<br/>\nmom, write it, WRITE IT!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe survived 2 months of kindergarten before the kids<br/>\nstarted to shame him for being too active, too loud,<br/>\ntoo bouncy, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n The pen search commenced as we surf, watch subtitled<br/>\nanime  on one tv, Powerpuff Girls on the other tv and<br/>\nthey switch back and forth, poodle in tow, from one<br/>\n&#39;blankie nest&#39; to another depending on which show is<br/>\ninteresting...it&#39;s 9:47, we will probably stay up<br/>\nuntil Reign is on in an hour or so, they usually fall<br/>\nasleep during that but I like the animation in it<br/>\n&lt;laughs&gt;.  Oops, Ted just pulled out my bellydance<br/>\ndrum, Carla joined him, so there is another thing to<br/>\ndo....which reminds me I have a new bellydance<br/>\nexercise vid, which reminds me I will show Carla how<br/>\nto hand sew bead trim on my new costume in the strong<br/>\nsunlight tomorrow...and so  it goes with our flow. <br/>\nThey can fall asleep watching either tv, snuggled with<br/>\nme or alone and I will leave the aquarium light on in<br/>\nthe living room when I go to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nKimontoya<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
