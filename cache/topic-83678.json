By highschool I would get really tired <br/>\nor terrible headaches from reading.   My mother took me to a handful of doctors <br/>\nbefore a optometrist (please correct my spelling) that had the same problem <br/>\nhelped me.   I can&#39;t remember what it is called, but I have perfect vision, but <br/>\nwhen I read my eyes have a problem with focus.   I just broke my glasses that <br/>\nI&#39;ve had for 13 years and I have to get new ones and have no idea what my <br/>\nprescription should be.   But, I had invisible bifocals with just enough of <br/>\ndifference to fix the problem.   It was amazing how well they worked.   I&#39;m having <br/>\nproblems since my glasses broke =)<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83619,"nextTopicId":83605}}
