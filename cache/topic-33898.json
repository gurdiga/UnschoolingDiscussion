We talked about decay and finding <br/>\nthe bones later and maybe we could pretent to be archeologist and on <br/>\na dig. We wondered how long it would take to decay down to the bone, <br/>\nwould we have to clean it up, would there be bugs in it..ect.. My <br/>\nyoungest at the time, she was 5, said &quot;lets name him Mr. Jones. Then <br/>\nMr. Jones we want to look at your bones..&quot;   We found out that decay <br/>\nhappens quick around here (Seattle) all that moisture and rich <br/>\nground, we figured.  3 months was all most to long to have the poor <br/>\nthing in the ground. By the time we dug it up only the biggest bones <br/>\nwere left.  No fur or skin, but a cool head.  My children have talked <br/>\nabout looking for some bigger animal, maybe a goose or a <br/>\nopossum...Maybe..I have a shovel, box, and gloves in the car at the <br/>\nready.  Truthfully I am not sure I am to excited about it though.  It <br/>\nis kinda gross at the start, but then pretty exciting when you get to <br/>\nthe skeleton.  Especially when you see your children excited to be <br/>\nliving and learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Our unschooling day","postDate":"1017499331","msgId":33918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMjY3M2ZiNzYuMjlkNzI4YzNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33898,"nextInTopic":33928,"prevInTime":33917,"nextInTime":33919,"topicId":33898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/29/02 10:10:50 PM, starsuncloud@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-507583292\">In a message dated 3/29/02 10:10:50 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Not everyone would be able to <br/>\nnot get squeamish at a dead squirrel...but &quot;hey, here are some gloves <br/>\nand a jar&quot; would at least not slam the door of opportunity in their <br/>\nface. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, I really enjoyed reading your squirrely day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom had grown up on a farm where they never bought meat, but ate what they <br/>\nraised.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce at my request she dissected a mouse she had caught in a trap.

They came barreling in the house <br/>\nexclaiming &quot;this is really cool Mom you HAVE to come see this&quot;.<br/>\nThey weren&#39;t sure what it was but because some fur and skin were <br/>\nstill holding it together they soon figured it out.<br/>\nI came out and helped them salvage some of the skeleton for <br/>\nobservation.<br/>\nNow, I could have said &quot;oooh, that thing is disgusting. Get it off <br/>\nthe driveway&quot;<br/>\nOr something to that effect.<br/>\nBut because I didn&#39;t here&#39;s what it led to.....<br/>\nWe picked out some bones and glued them to a piece of <br/>\ncardboard...they made guesses at what bone it was.<br/>\nOnline they reconstructed an entire skeleton, the website led us to <br/>\nowl pellets, then the Oakland zoo, green monkeys, Muntjacks (don&#39;t <br/>\neven ask how long we spent on the various species of Muntjacks), <br/>\nsomehow in between all this we got hungry and made Potato Latkes <br/>\nwhich we ate with chopsticks that the kids were fascinated with at <br/>\nthe grocery store.<br/>\nLater, they read a book and watched a movie in which chopsticks were <br/>\nused (no, this was not planned...just serendipity).<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you the things we learned or it would take up way too <br/>\nmuch room here.<br/>\nOne thing just naturally led to another. One of my children popped in <br/>\noccasionally to see what we were up to and absorbed only a few <br/>\ntidbits while happily roller blading the rest of the time.<br/>\nSo the moral of the story is it&#39;s us, the parents that must change.<br/>\nUnschooling works. It always works.<br/>\nBut only if we can be as excited and interested as our children.<br/>\nOr at least offer an avenue for them. Not everyone would be able to <br/>\nnot get squeamish at a dead squirrel...but &quot;hey, here are some gloves <br/>\nand a jar&quot; would at least not slam the door of opportunity in their <br/>\nface.<br/>\nI don&#39;t worry anymore that my children won&#39;t learn everything they <br/>\nneed to for this life.<br/>\nI also see that joyful learning can only happen if we are open and <br/>\ntotally willing to see every moment, every interest, everything as <br/>\nopportunity.<br/>\nWe never know what a tidbit of information, or an experience might <br/>\nlead to...and not knowing can bring  a sense of mystery to this whole <br/>\nUnschooling life. If we keep that sense of mystery, that feeling that <br/>\nthis COULD lead to big things, (but if it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s ok too)<br/>\nwe will so much better be able to serve our children well when <br/>\nsupporting and encouraging their unique interests and pursuits.<br/>\nThat&#39;s what it&#39;s all about for me.<br/>\nBeing an avenue instead of a closed door.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33975,"nextTopicId":33982}}
