But I can certainly<br/>\nremember PPD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is this &quot;just&quot; postpartum? Just, as in &quot;just hormonal induced<br/>\nexhaustion mixed with homicidal thoughts&quot;?  Or was that just me?  When I had<br/>\nmy last two I nearly throttled people who pointed out to me that I have all<br/>\ngirls. (Gosh...I hadn&#39;t noticed that!)  It really sent me over the edge when<br/>\npeople would talk in front of my daughters as if they were mistakes of some<br/>\nkind. Of course, that&#39;s not what you&#39;re talking about. I was just<br/>\nremembering how my irritability spread out to total strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt home I was worse. I think a big problem is people help mothers with the<br/>\nfirst baby and less and less for every one after that. They figure you know<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re doing, you don&#39;t want help, or (worse) they don&#39;t want to really<br/>\nhelp....they just want to hold the baby. I don&#39;t know about you, but when my<br/>\nbabies were less than 3 months old I was always tired. And when I&#39;m tired I<br/>\nhave a very hard time being cheerful. This will spill over even to the cute<br/>\nlittle children that you love. I remember apologizing a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only offer encouragement. And the well worn phrase: Time will take<br/>\ncare of it. Don&#39;t forget to take care of yourself, not only the children. I<br/>\nactually would forget to eat. If you knew me you&#39;d think this wasn&#39;t<br/>\npossible, but that&#39;s how muddled I was. Remember: If the mother&#39;s not happy,<br/>\nno one is happy. So take care of the Mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MorelFam@aol.com","from":"MorelFam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5mrryJfkW-wAiSXPFyr1K0Rytnq8rO9JeSM-5tWYWCuvxV6ON7x7USLctk4vKHhQkd6DsmYEkg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"is this just postpartum, then what do i do with my kids?","postDate":"968988494","msgId":13163,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlLjllNmE4ZTguMjZmMmYxNGVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13171,"prevInTime":13162,"nextInTime":13164,"topicId":13163,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"valerie writes:  valerie, maybe we should be epals too!  i could use some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2054235379\">valerie writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We really must be leading parallel lives...I have a 4 yo and 2 yo also. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nvalerie,<br/>\nmaybe we should be epals too!  i could use some practical parenting ideas for <br/>\nmy 4 and 2 year olds.  seems like everything i used to use when my 11 and 8 <br/>\nyear olds were that age either takes too much energy or patience now, or they <br/>\nare just responding differently.  or i am feeling the pressure of too many <br/>\ndemands on me these days.  i go along okay for a bit and then i lash out with <br/>\nimpatience, and i feel sorry for my kids bc of my unpredictability right now. <br/>\n it scares me when i do it, i begin to wonder what the heck am i doing?  and <br/>\nthen my cute little 2 year old starts saying &quot;sorry, mum&quot;  to every little <br/>\nthing, really making me feel horrible.  i know it is partly adjusting to baby <br/>\njoining the fam, but that doesnt help me practicality wise.  except that <br/>\nmaybe i have to lower my expectations (again?)...  whew.  i have a feeling <br/>\nthis behavior of mine is a classic symptom of something.  what is it?  and <br/>\nmore importantly, what is the cure?  <br/>\nslumpy in the south (ok, its erin...)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13272,"nextTopicId":13290}}
