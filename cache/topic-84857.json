I think there is just something very cool <br/>\nabout his wierdness,...like there&#39;s this deep, very unique crazy talent that <br/>\npeople like Jack Black or Jim Carrey or Chris Kattan (sp) have.  My son can also <br/>\ndo spot-on impressions of people and their voices.  More than once I&#39;ve <br/>\nyelled, &quot;Who&#39;s messing with so-and-so&quot; thinking Michael, or Kelsey were yelling <br/>\ncause he was tickling them or wrestling them.  It turned out it was CJ imitating <br/>\nthem.  He can also do many foreign accents...LOL...and can do entire scenes <br/>\nfrom movies word for word.  He&#39;s often dancing through the store or walking funny <br/>\nwhen I&#39;m with him.  He can almost never just give a straight answer for <br/>\nsomething.  He&#39;s 15, BTW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank God he&#39;s never been in school.....I KNOW he would have been labled ADHD <br/>\nor Hyper, or something!<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"What do you do when.....","postDate":"1068942963","msgId":84857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTE1LjE2MzY0MS4yMTA0My4xMzU0NjFAd2VibWFpbDA1Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":84860,"prevInTime":84856,"nextInTime":84858,"topicId":84857,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Oh boy, can I relate.
