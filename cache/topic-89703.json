I don&#39;t consider myself an <br/>\nunschooler by definition.  I am more interested in the concept and <br/>\nwould like to learn more about it.  A fellow home schooling friend of <br/>\n20+ years discovered your group and forwarded it to me.  That <br/>\nexplains how I ended up here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the mother in a combined family of seven children.  It&#39;s a long <br/>\nstory, but I home school the youngest, Adrian.  He will be 10 next <br/>\nmonth.  Our other children are as follows:  Tabitha, 18; Amy, 17.5; <br/>\nTammi and Tracey, 16; Amie, 14 in March; and Andrew, 12.  I am <br/>\nbiological mother to Amy and Adrian.  If you do the math, you will <br/>\nsee that there is about 8 years between them.  By the time I got into <br/>\nhome schooling, he was the only one left to focus on.  The rest of <br/>\nthe kids are not mine biologically, and I never found a loop hole to <br/>\nallow it legally.  At this point it&#39;s irrelevant since four of them <br/>\nwill graduate in the next year and a half.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m active in two local home school groups and belong to two more.  I <br/>\nenjoy the freedom of home schooling and am SO happy that it found <br/>\nme.  I look forward to picking your brains and having pleasant <br/>\nconversations with you all.  I don&#39;t have much of a clue about any of <br/>\nthis.  So, I hope this is a place where I will be able to ask <br/>\nquestions and learn from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to conversing with you all...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"Wife2Vegman","from":"Wife2Vegman &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: starting a sudbury school//HAHAHAHAHA","postDate":"1074804448","msgId":89727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTIyMjA0NzI4Ljk1Nzk2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJ1b2RzbytncGdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89719,"nextInTopic":89738,"prevInTime":89726,"nextInTime":89728,"topicId":89703,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
