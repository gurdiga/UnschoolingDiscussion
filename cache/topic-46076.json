Some people do, for some reasons which are sometimes good.  <br/>\nBut retroactively saying you&#39;ve unschooled since you had children isn&#39;t as <br/>\nhonest as it could be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to really look at what we&#39;re doing unless we can SEE what we&#39;re <br/>\ndoing, and getting a story clear in our own heads is a good way to look at <br/>\nit.  If someone tells people &quot;We call him this because...&quot; and the next day <br/>\nit&#39;s &quot;He made up his own nickname&quot; then there is a lack of clarity which goes <br/>\ndeeper than any one conversation, or weeklong discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, maybe long dicussions are the equivalent of people <br/>\nberating me because I don&#39;t play soccer or swim.  No amount of discussion is <br/>\ngoing to change that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHoward Gardner&#39;s description of intrapersonal intelligence (people can google <br/>\nit if that&#39;s unfamiliary) in his set of multiple intelligences describes <br/>\nsomething just as real as dancing or understanding math.  BUt not everyone is <br/>\nequally interested or facile with it.  I&#39;m not a dancer.  I&#39;m no jock.  Some <br/>\nparts of math confuse the heck out of me.  Interpersonal/intrapersonal and <br/>\nverbal stuff, though, come easy to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to get someone to understand or believe that some people can perceive <br/>\ninterpersonal situations better than others seems to be an insult in this <br/>\nculture.  Sometimes we take &quot;all men are created equal&quot; to mean all have the <br/>\nsame abilities and talents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone here were advising me or my kids on sports medicine, I would <br/>\nreally listen, because I don&#39;t know.  If someone advised me about how to seal <br/>\nup a shower or fix plumbing, I would really listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when interpersonal or intrapersonal skills are the question, all emotion <br/>\nbreaks loose and those who have less of it deny &quot;more of it&quot; could exist.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not clearly expressing myself, and I do know it&#39;s awkward <br/>\nsubject matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell when a note doesn&#39;t match another note.  Some people can&#39;t.  So I <br/>\nshould tune the guitar, not the other person.  If I say &quot;I&#39;m no better at <br/>\ntuning this guitar,&quot; or &quot;You know your own guitar best,&quot; that&#39;s not being <br/>\nhonest or helpful.  If I said &quot;I  have a guitar and it bothers me that the <br/>\nchords don&#39;t sound right,&quot; I could advise on tuning it even by e-mail.   If <br/>\nthat person then said &quot;I tuned it that way on purpose&quot; or &quot;It sounds fine to <br/>\nme,&quot; I would wonder what the original post had been about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: &quot;Words will never hurt me&quot;","postDate":"1034269289","msgId":46096,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyODUwMWMyNzA3ZSRhZTRhNzJhMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGFvNGI0MCtjbzNrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46093,"nextInTopic":46144,"prevInTime":46095,"nextInTime":46097,"topicId":46076,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thankfully, I am not one of those parents who are not willing to admit mistakes or wrongs they do/did.

I must say, your MIL must be a very dense woman if she could not see what her comments were doing to your husband. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve been very busy lately and am just now catching up on this list.  I have<br/>\n  to comment on the &quot;lazybones&quot;, nicknames issue.  My MIL says everything with a<br/>\n  smile, no matter how negative. The last time she visited she talked about how<br/>\n  lazy my husband was as a child, she laughed and talked about it in a<br/>\n  good-natured way.  I watched my husband smile and wince the whole time.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n  lived with him for 12 years I know it hurt him, she doesn&#39;t acknowledge it or<br/>\n  know it.  My husband tends to excuse everything she says even if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  like it, because she says everything so &quot;lovingly&quot;.  If he calls her on it,<br/>\n  who looks like the spoilsport? She&#39;s just being affectionate, right?  The<br/>\n  mother who calls her son lazybones writes in one of her posts that the son<br/>\n  enjoys the nickname.  Well maybe he sees that you enjoy it and approve of it,<br/>\n  it doesn&#39;t mean he enjoys it.  It may take him years to admit that he hates<br/>\n  it, just like it has my husband.  Children usually can&#39;t sort out complex<br/>\n  emotions and feelings until much later.  Right now all he knows is Mommy finds<br/>\n  &quot;lazybones&quot; cute, later on he may realize that Mommy was comparing him to his<br/>\n  more active sibling, negatively.  You may say it&#39;s not a negative comparison<br/>\n  but the first post on this &quot;lazy&quot; issue spoke volumns, every post after that<br/>\n  is just defensiveness.  I&#39;m not trying to be mean, just truthful.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n  unconsciously done the labeling thing to my own son.  Fortunately I&#39;ve had<br/>\n  friends and family call me on it and I&#39;ve taken into account what they have to<br/>\n  say.  Other people are not always right in their opinion but I figure if the<br/>\n  issue is presenting itself to me there is a damn good reason and I better look<br/>\n  at it closely before I dismiss it.  I&#39;d urge you to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
