Somewhere,  light is <br/>\ndawning. Some people, and I&#39;m one of them, believe that any portal to  the universe <br/>\nleads to the whole universe, and if that&#39;s true we should be able  to get to <br/>\neverything in the whole wide world (and beyond) without much effort  from <br/>\nsomething as small as, say, the definition of a word. How about &quot;morning&quot;  and its <br/>\nparticulars--daybreak, dawn and sunrise?  <br/>\nEvery day the sun comes up (unless you&#39;re in the Arctic or  Antarctic, in <br/>\nwhich cases your sun-mileage may vary). Every day is a new  opportunity. People <br/>\nsay that all the time: &quot;It&#39;s the dawning of a new day.&quot; If  you just let those <br/>\nthoughts and truths go by, you&#39;re missing something important  that happens <br/>\n365 days a year (sometimes with a bonus round). Don&#39;t miss  important things <br/>\nlike opportunities for renewal and change. At your house it  will be morning <br/>\nagain within 24 hours, but it could be morning in your heart any  second.  <br/>\n&quot;The morning of the world,&quot; someone might say, meaning just as  the world was <br/>\nnew and bright. From this we and our children can talk about and  learn about <br/>\npoetry and figurative speech. &quot;The morning of his life...&quot; when  likening a <br/>\nlifetime to a day, with its own first light, eventual afternoon, and  twilight. <br/>\nThese are common references. &quot;In Queen Victoria&#39;s day...&quot;  <br/>\nAt our wedding my friends and relatives all sang &quot;Morning Has  Broken,&quot; and <br/>\nit was the morning of our lives together. Later that day we had  three <br/>\nchildren. Well, later meaning over the next six and a half years.  Sometimes time <br/>\npasses slowly, and sometimes it speeds by, and there is a lesson  in focus, and in <br/>\nflow, and in biochemistry.  <br/>\nSome people collect bugs, or rocks, or videotapes. It&#39;s cheaper  and easier <br/>\nto collect words. If you have a name which is a noun, like &quot;Lynn&quot; or  &quot;Holly&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;Gill&quot; you&#39;ve probably developed an ear for hearing it and an eye for  <br/>\nseeing it in various contexts and have probably looked it up in dictionaries and  <br/>\nname books to see how old it is. This can be done with morning and joy and tree <br/>\n and wind. I should have put quotation marks on those, &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;joy&quot; <br/>\nand so  forth, to show that I mean the word morning, not the thing-in-the-sky <br/>\nmorning.  Now we&#39;re talking about punctuation, the mechanics of writing, and the <br/>\nbranch of  philosophy called ontology, about what &quot;being&quot; is-is the word <br/>\n&quot;morning&quot; part of  morning itself? Is morning inside my head? Where does a &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nmorning end and  just talking and thinking about morning start? Can you prete<br/>\nnd morning?  <br/>\nYou can spend $20 on a Mensa-approved plastic puzzle, or a book  of mind- <br/>\nbending questions, or you can just look out the window, name things,  and think. <br/>\nYou can play with a dictionary, ask each other odd questions, and  look up the <br/>\nanswers. It&#39;s the thinking that counts, the idea-getting, the  biochemical <br/>\nping when the light of a new concept dawns in your mind.  <br/>\nWhen people begin homeschooling, that&#39;s a big bright morning,  but you can <br/>\nhave as many mornings as you need. If you want to change the way  you&#39;re being <br/>\nor thinking, just do it. Don&#39;t wait for another year, another  month, another <br/>\nday. Good morning!  <br/>\nÂ© 1998 Sandra Dodd  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105303,"nextTopicId":105344}}
