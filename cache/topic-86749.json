So much that I can&#39;t even wrap my brain<br/>\naround it.  It has such variations going on all the time that it is soooo<br/>\nchallenging--different cards being drawn all the time so the scenerio is<br/>\nalways changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was growing up, I played Stratego,  that&#39;s about all I can handle,<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  set the stage and deal with it.   With Yu-Gi-Oh, the stage is<br/>\nconstantly changing.   Tons of thinking going on to play that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~  mom and wife to Yu-Gi-Oh players  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Andrea&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:andrea@...\">andrea@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 23, 2003 5:51 AM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Strategy Games, was Re: Radical vs.<br/>\nRegular?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; At 05:55 PM 12/22/03 -0800, Pam wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I love games.

My older sons (ages 11 and 8)<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t like the roll and move games much but William (11) said he played<br/>\n&gt; Risk and liked it. We have played Junior Labyrinth many many times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Donna Andrea<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
