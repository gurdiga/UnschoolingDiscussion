Most of us are in between, of course, <br/>\nbut I think what Sandra is saying is that some people really don&#39;t want ANY <br/>\nposts at the &quot;potentially dangerous&quot; end of the spectrum and would be happy <br/>\nif all posts were at the chit-chat sweet and always-supportive-of-everything <br/>\nend instead. I&#39;m not interested in sweet chitchat. I have other places for <br/>\nthat, for one thing, and this list has such a powerhouse of people with <br/>\nreally outside-the-box ideas that I want to hear them straight and undiluted. <br/>\nSometimes what someone says to me makes me catch my breath and it can even <br/>\nhurt and pretty often makes me want to jump to my own defense. I&#39;ve learned <br/>\nto resist that first impulse (usually) and spend time thinking about WHY I <br/>\ncare. WHY did it get an internal reaction from me? Why would I care what <br/>\nsomeone on some email list said? Why does it touch me? It HAS to be because <br/>\nit is touching something that is in ME --I have to recognize that, because <br/>\notherwise why would I care at all? As much admiration as I have for all of <br/>\nyou - most of you are not people I know enough about to take what you say too <br/>\nseriously JUST because you said it. It is the content of your posts that <br/>\nmatters - not that you said it. There is an impersonal nature to email list <br/>\ndiscussions when there are hundreds of people on the list -- it is great <br/>\nsince it means the content is what really counts, not the person who happens <br/>\nto say something. So if it gets to me, it is the content and I know that I <br/>\nneed to examine that content and how it applies to me. I&#39;d way rather have my <br/>\nthinking challenged even if it is hard to hear - even if my first reaction is <br/>\n&quot;How DARE she talk to me like that?&quot; I&#39;d so much rather have that then people <br/>\njust offering me goodhearted, well-meaning supportive comments. I&#39;m not in <br/>\nthat place where I, personally, have a need for that kind of thing - at least <br/>\nnot from a relatively impersonal email list. I really need to be stretched <br/>\nand challenged and even attacked a little - to grow. Others really NEED <br/>\npeople to send them hugs and need to be validated that they&#39;re &quot;okay.&quot; I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to reconcile these different needs on one list except to <br/>\nexpect everyone to be mature enough to put up with (and ignore) the stuff <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t appeal or apply to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nSome of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>\nharsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>\nuncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Learning consideration","postDate":"1020371574","msgId":36674,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDRDFBMjA2LjJFMTFFOURBQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":36669,"nextInTopic":36683,"prevInTime":36673,"nextInTime":36675,"topicId":36667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**If we say breastfeeding is good, someone breaks down in tears and says we shouldn t make her feel guilty because she bottle fed.
