In the <br/>\ncase of your friend who was going to stamp with your son, I would have <br/>\nconvinced Eric to go just as you did. We don&#39;t go out a lot through the <br/>\nweek, now, just gym day, library, usually a visit to a friend&#39;s house. In <br/>\nthe summer he would go to the beach quite happily most of the time.

I think her<br/>\nreasons for fussing are about not being in control of the transition from<br/>\none mode (playing at home) to another. I also thinks she takes after her<br/>\nfather - doesn&#39;t mind doing less liked stuff as long as she gets to grumble<br/>\nabout it. (LOL) One thing that I tried with her, is to say &quot;let&#39;s drive<br/>\nover, but if you still don&#39;t want to do it, we&#39;ll go home again.&quot; I said<br/>\nthis with ice skating, and ultimately she decided she really didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nskate any more just now.

(which is why I chose the snip above) It may be that he<br/>\nis still expecting to be sent back, or hasn&#39;t grasped just how much free<br/>\ntime he has at home now. 2-3 weeks is a very short time really. Maybe he&#39;s<br/>\nnot ready to share you just yet? Maybe he&#39;s seeing scheduled activities of<br/>\nany sort - even enjoyable crafting stuff - as being school like, with<br/>\nexpectations and judgments.
