My hubby REALLY loves them.  <br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s why we don&#39;t mind the piles of goodies, we ALL enjoy them.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without some of my childhood stuff.  And I&#39;m pretty <br/>\nsure <br/>\nit just wouldn&#39;t a great day without building with LEGOS at least once :o)<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I was straightening up the library (which has mostly books, and <br/>\ngaming stuff, but also some toys that need space, and that adults like).  We have <br/>\nthree sets of marble works and a hot-chocolate can full of marbles.  I <br/>\nvacuumed a whole end of the room for visiting kids to play with those.  (I kept some <br/>\nkids while their parents went to see Spiderman.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI took Kirby&#39;s gaming stuff carefully off the table up there and put out the <br/>\nSpanish castle blocks.  I undid some structures, but left a couple of tricky <br/>\nthings (how a window fits into a tower) and put the papers/booklets out, but <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t get played with. It&#39;s still there.  I imagine Marty or the next <br/>\nteens or young men who come by will find it irresistable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen do people &quot;outgrow&#39; realistic castle blocks?<br/>\nI think our first problem with those will come when it&#39;s time to decide which <br/>\ngrown child inherits them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a wooden rocking horse puzzle someone made with a band saw out of 2&quot; <br/>\nthick wood, and stained the pieces afterward.  It&#39;s flat but when it&#39;s put <br/>\ntogether it can stand up and rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby got it when he was too little to work it, from his grandparents.  But <br/>\nit&#39;s a beautiful thing, and it comes out from time to time and now the kids all <br/>\nknow how to do it and find it easy.  (Not all pices fit together from the <br/>\nsame side, so it&#39;s a bit tricky.)   It&#39;s apiece of art, and I would pack it <br/>\ncarefully and stick it in a shed before I would give it away or sell it.  It&#39;s <br/>\nKirby&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe packrats have an easier time with unschooling, and maybe not.  I think <br/>\nif someone lived sparsely, more trips out to see, hear, touch, play, taste, <br/>\nand smell would be necessary. My kids really like being home, more than I <br/>\nthought they would.  More than I did when I was their ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro/Gift Questions","postDate":"1090164101","msgId":96436,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJCRUNEMTM1LUQ4Q0UtMTFEOC04MzJGLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0My4yZTFlMzM2YS4yZTJiMTk0YkBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE0My4yZTFlMzM2YS4yZTJiMTk0YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96435,"nextInTopic":96437,"prevInTime":96435,"nextInTime":96437,"topicId":96318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The toys are not confined to one room but are part of the whole..um..decor? I sort it all. One rubbermaid tub for Barbies, another for small animal toys. No puzzle stays in its box but gets dumped in a ziplock bag with the picture cut out. I have one bucket for dinkies, one for Transformers (my DH&#39;s old ones and my daughter LOVES these). I know we have too much because I have to rearrange everything when a new toy comes into the house. My livingroom looks like a rec room. But, I can&#39;t get rid of this stuff. It&#39;s not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n   It hasn&#39;t been an issue until this year.  Now it&#39;s just<br/>\n  too cramped here and I am overwhelmed with the amount of toys we have.  I<br/>\n  am also overwhelmed at the thought of getting so many more in the next<br/>\n  month.  It seriously stresses me out.  I&#39;m not trying to take fun away<br/>\n  from my children, but there has to be a happy medium.  We can not<br/>\n  continue to accumulate toys at this rate.  I appreciate the advice about<br/>\n  being happy that we have people who want to give them things, and I&#39;m<br/>\n  sorry for those of you who don&#39;t have anybody, but I think this is a<br/>\n  different issue.

Another thing...would some like to give gifts like annual museum r zoo passes? Magazine subscriptions? <br/>\n<br/>\n  I DO know the feeling of dreading Xmas because of all the work I&#39;ll have to do to fit everything in. But it always does fit. Granted, every room in the house has toys somewhere. Oh, but there&#39;s one advantage to lots of stuff that I&#39;ve noticed. It&#39;s that my kids can recognize that some of it doesn&#39;t have any value and so it can be given away. The idea of a few special toys sounds good (I bought it for ahwile) but can give material possessions a weight they might not deserve. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro/Gift Questions","postDate":"1090129088","msgId":96415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2NTEwMjQ4LUQ4N0MtMTFEOC04MzJGLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE3LjIzNTEzOS4zMTA4LjQ1LmFiYnlhbGRyaWNoMUBqdW5vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE3LjIzNTEzOS4zMTA4LjQ1LmFiYnlhbGRyaWNoMUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":96411,"nextInTopic":96425,"prevInTime":96414,"nextInTime":96416,"topicId":96318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The<br/>\nrelatives who really know them and spend time with them don&#39;t do that.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what we do with Jayn&#39;s gifts, taking into account her dislike of<br/>\nsurprises, is ask her what she would like from a specific relative, like<br/>\nNan. Last Christmas she chose Mommy&#39;s Little Patient a couple of months<br/>\nbefore. She got a huge amount of joy in anticipation, and in telling<br/>\neveryone that Nan and Grandpa were going to give her that particular<br/>\npresent. She would have been really upset if anyone else had tried to give<br/>\nher that doll earlier. Naturally Nan was on board with this, and did not try<br/>\nto get some other thing, which would have been devastating. I would suggest<br/>\ncreating a list with your kids of specific toys they would like, and then<br/>\ndistributing this to some of the relatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we are lucky with all of dh&#39;s family, because they have a tradition<br/>\nof distributing lists of desired items and checking up with people about<br/>\nwhat they might like. For them this is more important than surprise. I was<br/>\npretty startled by this when I first joined the family. However it seems to<br/>\nwork. Dh&#39;s mother likes to give clothes or homemade jewelery to Jayn, but<br/>\nalways checks with us first about colors or styles (from catalogues). We<br/>\nusually run the suggestions by Jayn first. My mother OTOH seems to have a<br/>\nreal line onto what Jayn will like to wear in the dresses she makes or buys<br/>\nas surprises. Sure has changed from when I was a little girl and spent my<br/>\nentire childhood hating most of my clothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor her last birthday Jayn wanted a Maleficent doll from Disneyland. She<br/>\ntold everyone that she was getting this, with enormous excitement making her<br/>\nunintelligible. (Many confused looks from friends and neighbors). On no<br/>\naccount was I permitted to buy the doll for her on any earlier visit to<br/>\nDisneyland. Tears ensued when I offered to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn was a baby, we sometimes asked family members for the money for<br/>\nher bank account (actually a Mutual Fund).<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is part of a post that I sent about toys last time this question was<br/>\nactive. There was a lot in that thread about some really creative storage<br/>\nsolutions also. The thread was actually called &quot;Violent toys?&quot; if your want<br/>\nto search the archives.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote Begins:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Now the only criteria I use for whether I will buy a toy are: 1/ Jayn<br/>\n(4.5) has actually asked for it; 2/ We can afford it; 3/ We have the room<br/>\nfor it in our apartment. (She can hardly wait for a new room so she can have<br/>\na dolls&#39; house). *All* her toys are learning tools, and the issue of quality<br/>\nhas been one that I have also let go of. For example, I was only interested<br/>\nin getting her nice paints and real bristle paintbrushes. She asked for the<br/>\nreally cheap little watercolor trays that come with coloring books, and<br/>\nlikes using those awful cheap brushes they come with to scrape on the paper,<br/>\nalong with her good brushes. She has often gotten just as much out of the<br/>\ndolls that come with her Happy Meal, as she has out of her collectible<br/>\nBarbies - and boy do I feel better about her pulling those ones apart to<br/>\nturn them into puppets, or repainting their clothes different colors.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually I let go of my anxiety about her destroying any of her own things,<br/>\nas long as she is doing it deliberately and mindfully - transformation not<br/>\ndestruction. I mean, if she is throwing something in a fury, I try to<br/>\nprevent the damage since I know she will be sorry later, but if she is<br/>\ncutting their hair knowing it won&#39;t grow back - well they are her things,<br/>\nnot mine. She also has a bunch of porcelain dolls, of which she is very<br/>\ncareful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does Jayn discover the toys she wants? TV, internet, catalogues,<br/>\nbrowsing at stores, visiting friends, seeing some toy/tool Daddy has bought<br/>\nfor himself. Least successful: adults buying her some unseen or unasked for<br/>\ntoy and giving it to her as a surprise. Sometimes she gets downright angry<br/>\nand insists we take it back to the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always disliked those electronic toys along the lines of Lets Pretend<br/>\nElmo (is that the right name?) that direct the child&#39;s play. I think<br/>\ndisliking them allowed me to feel superior somehow. Jayn solves that problem<br/>\nwith pretty much all the dolls she has that talk, by choosing to switch them<br/>\noff. What a concept: she is in charge of her own playing and there is no<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way to use any of it! I can trust her to use all her stuff in ways<br/>\nfar beyond the instructions.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther to this, we have just spent a charming afternoon repainting her<br/>\nFisher Price plastic farmhouse with what she evidently considers more<br/>\nrealistic colors.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Mine always love to brag about who sent them <br/>\n&gt; what.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If it&#39;s really important to you to limit the toys, then maybe ask <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; relatives to send money for a piggy bank, or savings bonds, or <br/>\n&gt; clothing you may need <br/>\n&gt; for them, etc.  We asked everyone once to not send any more stuffed <br/>\n&gt; animals <br/>\n&gt; cuz they are expensive and my kids don&#39;t play with them ever.  We <br/>\n&gt; have chains <br/>\n&gt; from the ceilings filled with the cutest dust collector&#39;s you&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; ever seen.  <br/>\n&gt; Once in awhile we throw them all down for cleaning and they fiddle <br/>\n&gt; with them for <br/>\n&gt; a minute, then they&#39;re off to do something else.  So the collection <br/>\n&gt; is lesser <br/>\n&gt; now and the money isn&#39;t being wasted, they send other stuff <br/>\n&gt; instead.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pamela<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

Your older kids might TOTALLY love whatever the <br/>\nbaby gets for her birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8774371,"authorName":"Abigail C Aldrich","from":"Abigail C Aldrich &lt;abbyaldrich1@...&gt;","profile":"bryabaldrich","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro/Gift Questions","postDate":"1090076635","msgId":96318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE3LjExMDQzNi4zMTA4LjQwLmFiYnlhbGRyaWNoMUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96322,"prevInTime":96317,"nextInTime":96319,"topicId":96318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everybody, I m Abby, mom to 3 daughters, 5yo twins and an 11mo.

I love lurking on<br/>\nthis list and am learning more and more about unschooling, so thanks for<br/>\nthat. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question about handling birthday and other holiday gift issues<br/>\nas far as the rest of the family is concerned.  I&#39;ve been told that I&#39;m<br/>\nbeing too much of a control freak by asking the grandparents, aunts and<br/>\nuncles to limit toys.  For my baby&#39;s first birthday next month I&#39;m<br/>\nconsidering asking them to donate a book to our tiny public library in<br/>\nthe baby&#39;s name instead of loading her up with toys.  Other than that, I<br/>\nhave no idea how to curb the over-giving.  Can anybody share experiences?<br/>\n What about for the older kids?  My girls love to play dollhouse with<br/>\nanything--dinosaurs, Spider-man figurines, even colored pencils.  No<br/>\nmatter what kinds of toys they get, they turn them into families or<br/>\nfriends and have roles for each of them.  That is the kind of play they<br/>\nmost enjoy, but nobody ever wants to get them yet another set of<br/>\n&quot;people,&quot; and I&#39;m not sure I want them to have that much stuff anyway.  I<br/>\njust feel like they have too much stuff and I don&#39;t know how to stop the<br/>\naccumulation.  Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>\nTIA,<br/>\nAbby<br/>\nLena and Liberty 4/17/99<br/>\nMaya 8/17/03<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe best thing to hit the Internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!<br/>\nSurf the Web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!<br/>\nOnly $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96873,"nextTopicId":96774}}
