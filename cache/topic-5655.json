They had a<br/>\ngreat program explaining with models and slides what the total lunar eclipse<br/>\nwas, what to expect, how often it happens, etc.  That was about a half hour<br/>\nlong.  Then it was time to go to the telescopes.  Unfortunately, this was the<br/>\nfirst time all week we hadn&#39;t thrown the winter coats into the back of the<br/>\nvan, and we hadn&#39;t been back to the condo since we left earlier that day<br/>\non field trips, so we didn&#39;t have them with us.  And, yes, the telescopes<br/>\nwere all outside.  There were two huge ones - we saw Saturn through the first<br/>\none.  The kids said it looked fake, and it did! It was very white and solid,<br/>\nand the rings were very clear.  It looked like a sticker, but of course<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we saw the moon through a couple other telescopes... but we Floridians<br/>\nwere standing out there with the temps in the 40s, with only light sweaters<br/>\non, and our teeth were chattering.  We asked if the view from there would be<br/>\nmuch different from what we could see elsewhere, and they said other than the<br/>\nfact that you could the telescopes to see it closely, it might actually be<br/>\nbetter viewed out of town, where the lights from the town below weren&#39;t a<br/>\ndistraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we went back to our condo, went to the second floor, and sat on the bed<br/>\nlooking out the window. We saw it all - but it wasn&#39;t very spectacular! We<br/>\nsaw the shadow of the Earth on the moon get bigger and bigger, eventually<br/>\ncovering the moon... but it never really turned color.  It was definitely<br/>\nnot &quot;blood red&quot; from here!  We used the binoculars, watched for a while,<br/>\ntook a few pictures, then gave up.  We did look outside a while later and saw<br/>\nthe shadow leaving the Moon... <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the experience was definitely interesting - I&#39;m glad we went to the <br/>\nprogram at the Observatory to learn more about the eclipse... but it&#39;s like<br/>\nthe &quot;incredibly bright full moon&quot; we were to have on 12/21/99 - good, but<br/>\ndidn&#39;t live up to expectations!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin from Orlando, FL, on vacation in Flagstaff, AZ<br/>\n :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"a8a_4SvzCp03E-1ZvRF_gpnBavMQQubrcZMiaQ-HLy1Czr75ACtTmCh0MYEIj1BtAp28pYMxeTSgcgKFu0yAvmNv0Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: re: Blood Red Moon","postDate":"948590353","msgId":5724,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNzguNTcyNC45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5722,"nextInTopic":5726,"prevInTime":5723,"nextInTime":5725,"topicId":5655,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"the link Mary Ellen posted has four pictures on it. http://eclipse.span.ch/liveshow.htm Lynda","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1981593282\">the link Mary Ellen posted has four pictures on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eclipse.span.ch/liveshow.htm\">http://eclipse.span.ch/liveshow.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RNorell@...\">RNorell@...</a><br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] re: Blood Red Moon<br/>\n&gt; Date: Saturday, January 22, 2000 9:28 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RNorell@...\">RNorell@...</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the way, I tried to find pictures of the lunar eclipse online, to see<br/>\n&gt; if it was more colorful elsewhere, but was unable to find pictures any-<br/>\n&gt; where... not even www.usatoday.com or any other news or NASA site... has<br/>\n&gt; anyone seen any posted of the lunar eclipse from this past week?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; Robin<br/>\n&gt; Orlando, FL<br/>\n&gt;  :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     GRAB THE GATOR!
