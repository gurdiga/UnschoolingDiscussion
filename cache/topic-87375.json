Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevor turned 14 today. He&#39;s up at the mall shopping with Markus (dh) while the rest of the crew is playing on the swing he rigged up yesterday. It&#39;s a rope that hangs from a branch about 20 feet up, so when they swing it arches so high it makes me ill to watch. I keep hearing shreiks and squeals of delight as their tummies turn inside out....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe attended a small, intimate dinner party last night. Dr. Michael Kovach (Dr. of acupuncture and Chinese medicine) was chatting with Trevor quite a bit. They talked about their thoughts on the war and several other current issues. Later in the night I got quizzed about whether they get tested, whether I have to follow any government regulations etc... I explained unschooling in depth. They all thought it was pretty cool, but especially Dr. Kovach. He explained how rotten he did in school all the years he was there, and then went on to get straight A&#39;s during his schooling later, that he was actually interested in. So unschooling seemed awesome to him....it was obvious in his world that learning only happens when a person wants information.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he went on to comment that the few homeschoolers he met seemed so much more knowledgeable and capable than other teens he&#39;d met. The fact that Trevor could carry on a conversation with adults about many different topics had really impressed him. The fact that all of my kids were perfectly happy to hang out with a bunch of adults at a party impressed him. So it was a very affirming moment.<br/>\nCourse, I hang out with very enlightened people!:)hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was a nice way to enter the New Year, eating healthy food, chatting with very mindful and interesting people and just being together as a family. Perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyone else had a wonderful night, whether it was spent quietly at home or out with a crowd. My wish for everyone is happier families, happier kids and the ability to have more fun and live more mindfully! <br/>\nI think Lyle will keep us on track with remembering to PLAY!<br/>\nIt&#39;s ironic really, my funshop at the conference was all about remembering to PLAY, to be goofy and silly and have fun in order to regain that creative genius we are born to be. And yet, I find I am all blocked up over really being creative with housework.<br/>\nWhen in doubt, turn it into a game. That&#39;s the best advice I&#39;ve ever gotten.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and peace to all in 2004,<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87064,"nextTopicId":87337}}
