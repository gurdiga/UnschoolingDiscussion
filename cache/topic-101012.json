Maybe <br/>\nit&#39;s all the Uns we relate to.  We could be Un Un Uns for short!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW Holly, I thought that was a great article, too.  You know, they <br/>\nalways have to counter EVERY homeschool article with some less than <br/>\nenlightened school administrator - fortunately for the reporters, they <br/>\nare very easy to find. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoni Zander<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FotoCEO@...\">FotoCEO@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100980,"nextTopicId":100922}}
