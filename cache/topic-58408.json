If you can&#39;t do it <br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;paper, somehow you&#39;re missing a piece in your head.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Many people here have talked about how their kids know how to do math<br/>\n&gt;things, but not on paper.  They know how to do them in their minds, because<br/>\n&gt;they understand the concept.  When shown how to do it on paper, it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;simple transfer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it&#39;s like learning to play piano without music, and then having<br/>\n&gt;someone explain what the silly little black marks on the paper mean.  This<br/>\n&gt;black dot here refers to this key on the piano, and we call it C.  We could<br/>\n&gt;call it George, or Fudnups, or whatever, but we call it C.  It&#39;s giving a<br/>\n&gt;name and a symbol to something that any pianist would understand, but <br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;know how to put into writing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;School math is all about memorizing a series of steps to convert fractions,<br/>\n&gt;come up with common denominators, multiply them, etc.  If your son <br/>\n&gt;memorizes<br/>\n&gt;that series of steps, then he&#39;ll &quot;get&quot; it.  But only as long as he <br/>\n&gt;remembers<br/>\n&gt;the steps.  (Hopefully long enough for the test is how I usually figured<br/>\n&gt;it!).  But if he truly understand the big picture and understands what<br/>\n&gt;fractions and decimals are, and how they work *in real life*, then doing it<br/>\n&gt;on paper is merely an extension of that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For him to have success at this, he needs to go find fractions, decimals,<br/>\n&gt;and all that stuff, all over your life.  USE them, manipulate them, and <br/>\n&gt;live<br/>\n&gt;with them.  When you go back to the paper, THEN your son can expect <br/>\n&gt;success.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;brenda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58399,"nextTopicId":58386}}
