(Only exception will be DDESS with two<br/>\nhome schooling parents.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSO WHO ARE THE HOME SCHOOLING REPS GONNA BE?????  I sure hope it&#39;ll<br/>\nbe people who consider themselves responsible for being *visible* and<br/>\n*open* and *respectful of all homeschoolers* and *accountable to the<br/>\nENTIRE community*.  This secret stuff is getting really old.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, here&#39;s the rest of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\n<br/>\nE-mail Letter from Dr. Mike Perez (Education Director, USAREUR):<br/>\n<br/>\n1 .  Over one year ago, LTG Jordan, USAREUR Deputy Commanding General<br/>\n(DCG), became aware of a situation in Heidelberg involving a young<br/>\nman who had been home schooled throughout his high school years.<br/>\nThis young man was a military family member who was unable to achieve<br/>\nhigh enough scores on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery<br/>\n(ASVAB) to qualify for entrance on active Army service.  The DCG<br/>\nbegan to ask a series of questions, such as:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  Who is responsible for ensuring that home schooled children<br/>\nwithin USAREUR communities receive a quality education?<br/>\n<br/>\nb.  What are the Commander&#39;s responsibilities concerning education of<br/>\nall school age children in USAREUR?<br/>\n<br/>\nc.  How many school age children in USAREUR communities are being<br/>\nhome schooled?<br/>\n<br/>\nd.  What set of laws, rules, regulations apply for home schoolers in<br/>\nUSAREUR?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2 .  The Education Division within the Office of the ADCSPIM is<br/>\nresponsible, among other things, for the DoDDS Liaison and Policy<br/>\nFunction at Headquarters, USAREUR. Research into this issue revealed<br/>\nthe following: Home schooling, like all education, is a States&#39;<br/>\nrights issue in the U.S. Therefore, almost all regulatory authority<br/>\nconcerning public education is found in the individual States&#39; laws.<br/>\nLikewise, each State passes laws concerning the conduct of home<br/>\nschooling within that State.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3 .  The crux of the home schooling issue is the balance of two sets<br/>\nof rights:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  The rights of parents to home school their school age children.<br/>\n<br/>\nb.  The rights of children to a quality education.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4 .  In Europe, the rights of parents to home school their school age<br/>\nchildren are protected.  In fact, many parents within the European<br/>\nU.S. community exercise this option.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n5 .  In Europe, there are no U.S. laws that protect the rights of<br/>\nchildren to a quality education.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6 .  Although there is a current Army regulation that briefly<br/>\naddresses &quot;educational neglect,&quot; there is insufficient definition to<br/>\nprovide meaningful guidance to Commanders in the enforcement of any<br/>\npolicy related to such neglect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n7 .  A review of existing State laws in the U.S. reveals a wide range<br/>\nof possible laws concerning home schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8 .  There is a series of councils in USAREUR that makes it possible<br/>\nfor parents, DoDDS teachers and administrators, and Commanders to<br/>\nvoice their concerns about education of school age children in this<br/>\nCommand.  This series includes:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  School Advisory Council (SAC) at the individual school level.<br/>\n<br/>\nb.  Installation Advisory Council (IAC) at the installation (ASG)<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nc.  Component Commander&#39;s Advisory Council, chaired by the DCG twice<br/>\nannually.<br/>\n<br/>\nd.  The European Schools Council, chaired by the J-1 staff at<br/>\nHeadquarters, European Command (EUCOM), and attended by the USAREUR<br/>\nDCG (also twice annually).<br/>\n<br/>\ne.  The Dependent Education Council, chaired by DoDEA in Arlington,<br/>\nVirginia and attended by the USAREUR DCG twice annually.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n9 .  In the past two years, at each CCAC, ASG Commanders have voiced<br/>\ntheir concern about the lack of detailed policy on home schooling in<br/>\nEUCOM and in USAREUR.  Based on these concerns, the USAREUR DCG<br/>\nraised this issue at the past two DEC meetings in Arlington, VA.   As<br/>\na result, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) has<br/>\nformed a Home Schooling Working Group (HSWG).  The first meeting of<br/>\nthe HSWG was held on 12 Feb 01 at DoDEA HQ in Arlington, VA.  Present<br/>\nwere representatives from:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  HQ, DoDEA.<br/>\nb.  HQ, EUCOM, J-1.<br/>\nc.  HQ, Department of the Army, Community and Family Support Center<br/>\n(CFSC).<br/>\nd.  HQ, U.S. Marine Corps.<br/>\ne.  HQ, U.S. Air Force.<br/>\nf.  HQ, USAREUR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n10 .  Based on current States laws, following issues were identified<br/>\nto be included in the HSWG focus:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  Attendance/Hours of Instruction per Subject.<br/>\nb.  Record keeping.<br/>\nc.  Curriculum requirements/core subjects.<br/>\nd.  Teacher qualifications.<br/>\ne.  Requirement to notify of intent to home school.<br/>\nf.  Accountability.<br/>\ng.  Access to sports and other school-sponsored activities and<br/>\nfacilities.<br/>\nh.  Testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n11 .  Based on this preliminary meeting, the following actions were<br/>\ntaken:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  DoDEA has requested Department of Defense (DoD) General Counsel<br/>\n(GC) to conduct research and report concerning the laws of host<br/>\nnations where military personnel are stationed outside the<br/>\nContinental U.S. (OCONUS).<br/>\n<br/>\nb.  DoDEA has requested DoD GC to conduct research and report<br/>\nconcerning current regulations within DoD which might impact on home<br/>\nschooling OCONUS.<br/>\n<br/>\nc.  DoDEA has requested Component Commands, e.g. USAREUR, to conduct<br/>\nHome Schooling focus groups and has provided a set of standardized<br/>\nquestions for those groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nd.  DoDEA will convene a full HSWG in September (tentative).<br/>\n<br/>\n(1)  The HSWG will consist of voting and non-voting members:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a)  The voting members will be comprised of representatives from<br/>\neach component command, i.e. USAREUR; U.S. Air Force, Europe (USAFE);<br/>\nMarine Forces, Europe (MARFOREUR); Navy, Europe (NAVEUR); Central<br/>\nCommand (CENTCOM); Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC); U.S. Army,<br/>\nPacific (USARPAC); Eighth U.S. Army (EUSA); Commander in Chief,<br/>\nPacific (CINCPAC), and the Defense Domestic Education School System.<br/>\n(DDESS).  Each of the component commands will be permitted to<br/>\ndesignate two voting representatives, one command representative and<br/>\none home schooling parent.  (Only exception will be DDESS with two<br/>\nhome schooling parents.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(b)  The non-voting members will be:  DODEA; representatives from<br/>\neach CINC (5)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n12 .  It is estimated that this meeting of the full HSWG will take 3-<br/>\n4 days. This meeting will be conducted in the Washington, DC area.<br/>\nThe Home School Defense League of America and other external groups<br/>\nwill be invited to present.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n13 .  The HSWG will:<br/>\n<br/>\na.  Consider the issues identified in paragraph 11 above.<br/>\n<br/>\nb.  Develop recommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\nc.  Report out to Director, DoDEA and other DoD officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this list please send an email to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NHEN-Legislative-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">NHEN-Legislative-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
