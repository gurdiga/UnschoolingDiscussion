You know, the usual <br/>\nteamwork, discipline, overcoming stage fright, etc.  And the kind of full <br/>\nbody movements they use are so good for calming her down and helping her <br/>\nfocus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gym we go to is very aware when  a girl gets overwhelmed and needs to <br/>\ntake a break. They have been very supportive of Casey&#39;s quirks and unusual <br/>\nlearning style. She did drop it once when she felt burned out, but has <br/>\npicked it up again with renewed vigor. This was the same kid who decided not <br/>\nto go school part-time because it would interfere with her life too much. <br/>\nFor Casey, unschooling has been the key to opening so many paths.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33570,"nextTopicId":33577}}
