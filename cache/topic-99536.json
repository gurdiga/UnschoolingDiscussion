I only knew about 3 families <br/>\nin my general area who were unschooling, and wanted to try to build an <br/>\nunschooling community.   I set up a Louisiana Unschooling list on yahoo, then sent an <br/>\nannouncement/invitation out to several local groups letting them know about <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s only been a couple of weeks and there are 27 members!  Not all of them <br/>\nare radical unschoolers (in fact only a small handful are), but people are <br/>\ncoming... and reading...and asking questions. I&#39;m hopefully we&#39;ll convert them - <br/>\nLOL.  I&#39;m finding that there are a lot of people who &#39;think&#39; they know what it <br/>\nmeans, but then discover they were totally wrong.  But the ones who stay are <br/>\ninterested in learning.  I put up lots of links on the homepage, with articles <br/>\nby Sandra, Danielle, Anne, etc., so the info is there for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned how to set up the site by looking at other state unschooling lists <br/>\non yahoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99522,"nextTopicId":99179}}
