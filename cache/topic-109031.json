It looks impressive to relatives but it  <br/>\nisn&#39;t the same as understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard Feynman, the physicist, said that his grandfather told him  <br/>\nthat someone could memorize the names of all the birds and still  <br/>\nknown nothing about birds. That is, if they changed all the birds&#39;  <br/>\nnames, the memorizer would know nothing! But observing the behavior  <br/>\nof birds -- if that interests someone -- asking questions about why  <br/>\nthey do as they do, is real learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids do that naturally. They&#39;re always observing and (sometimes  <br/>\nsilently) asking questions, wondering why. Bouncing on a trampoline  <br/>\nand coming to know instinctively that bouncing at an angle will send  <br/>\nyou off at an angle is real learning. When a child who has done. or  <br/>\nplayed pool or bounced balls or played sports, later takes physics  <br/>\nand reads &quot;Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection&quot; they&#39;ll  <br/>\nunderstand that with their whole bodies :-) But the real learning  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t in reading the scientific principle but in experiencing how  <br/>\nthings work.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelax. Lead rich lives and do things because they&#39;re fun! :-) The  <br/>\nlearning will follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Help with &quot;Speaking&quot; Math...Particularly Fraction to Percent Coversion","postDate":"1129652504","msgId":109032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMC41NDlmNzlkYi4zMDg2N2IxOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109031,"nextInTopic":109033,"prevInTime":109031,"nextInTime":109033,"topicId":109031,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
