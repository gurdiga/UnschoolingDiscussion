This is the last few weeks your baby will live as part of you, this will never be again and just enjoy this little being that is working his/her way to separating from your body. Talk to the baby, make sure it knows it is welcome and you&#39;re so happy it&#39;s about to be born.<br/>\nDrink nettle tea in addition to the raspberry tea...it has a lot of vitamin K and you won&#39;t need the vit. K for the baby after birth, plus if you bleed it will help you clot faster. Nettle tea probably saved my life after my last little guy was born. I hemmorraghed, but it clotted rather than gushing, due to all that nettle tea I drank.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are homeopathic remedies to induce labor, but it only works when the body is very ready.
