I tend to wonder<br/>\n&gt; about foundation information too, Laraine. I strive to be more<br/>\n&gt; &#39;unschooling&#39; in my approach...and that is why I am on this list , but I<br/>\n&gt; still struggle with leaving the math-learning to its own devices.<br/>\n&gt; I have two friends who are unschoolers through and through. Their children<br/>\n&gt; now are in high school or have gone to college. Both friends tell me that<br/>\n&gt; they did not teach math from a text or from a workbook and they both regret<br/>\n&gt; not keeping up with &#39;building blocks&#39; of learning math. Their children<br/>\n&gt; struggled with math  when they went mainstream. The struggle was painful<br/>\n&gt; and it took a long time to catch up. In other subjects they were on top of<br/>\n&gt; the class but in math they were frustrated. They have advised me to<br/>\n&gt; unschool in all subjects except in math.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is my personal experience.  My daughter was in ps until halfway <br/>\nthrough her sophomore year.  She was always in advanced math.  After <br/>\nwe took her out,  we enrolled her in a correspondence program and her <br/>\ndad tutored her individually through geometry and algebra 2.  She <br/>\nreceived good grades in both subjects.  Still,  when she took the <br/>\nACT,  her math score was  not wonderful and she lacks confidence in <br/>\nher math skills.  This semester she is taking intermediate algebra in <br/>\ncollege which is basically a refresher/remedial course.  The number <br/>\nof students that end up needing this course is enormous and most of <br/>\nthese kids came out of ps.  Dh is a college professor.  He feels like <br/>\nabout 1/3 of his students really &quot;get&quot; math.  What I&#39;m trying to say is that <br/>\nstructured math in the ps style is no guarantee that the kids aren&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to struggle.  I think losing confidence plays not an <br/>\ninsignificant role.  Now,  my 13 year old unschooler chooses to do <br/>\nquite a bit of math.  He really &quot;gets&quot; it.  I went all the way <br/>\nthrough college and was identified as gifted in math.  I can honestly <br/>\nsay that I don&#39;t get it.  Dh (the college prof) flunked 5th grade <br/>\nmath and wasn&#39;t considered college material.  He not only gets it - <br/>\nhe uses it every day of his life.  We will continue to approach math <br/>\nin an unschooling fashion.  If ds wants to enroll in a course,  he <br/>\ncertainly can.  What&#39;s important to me is that he enjoys the math <br/>\nthat he does and he has the confidence to know that he can learn <br/>\nwhatever he needs to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2558,"nextTopicId":2565}}
