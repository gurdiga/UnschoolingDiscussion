Ask him what he wants to get out of playing the piano, and <br/>\nteach the tools he needs to reach that goal. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKirsten (4/72)- mom to 3 sons: Skyler (5/96), Aric (5/97), and Sawyer (3/99), <br/>\nwife to Carl (5/72)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] helping almost 7 year old to learn piano","postDate":"1111078286","msgId":104600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDguNjQ2YTE0NGMuMmY2YjBmOGVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":104598,"nextInTopic":104601,"prevInTime":104599,"nextInTime":104601,"topicId":104598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/17/2005 9:26:47 AM Mountain Standard Time, brewstersears@sympatico.ca writes: He wants  to learn how to play the piano, and he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1906886879\">In a message dated 3/17/2005 9:26:47 AM Mountain Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brewstersears@...\">brewstersears@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants  to learn how to play the piano, and he specifically wants me to <br/>\nhelp  him.

Maybe <br/>\nadd another one, so you&#39;re doing chords, like twister.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat about just playing chords or basslines to something they play by ear?  <br/>\nIf they can do a melody, you could improvise another part.  If you&#39;re  <br/>\naccustomed to playing always formally by sheetmusic and they see you  improvising, it <br/>\nmight make improvising and playing by ear seem  more legitimate.   I know I <br/>\nsuffered from that prejudice as  a kid.  I was really PLAYING piano because I <br/>\nwas reading music, but my  mom, who was &quot;just&quot; playing tunes and chords, was <br/>\njust playing &quot;with&quot; the  piano (I thought) and not really playing it.    There&#39;s <br/>\na  schoolish prejudice.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI started playing piano at five, and didn&#39;t start school until a year  later, <br/>\nso I read music before I read English, and that has made it really hard  for <br/>\nme to explain music reading now.  I don&#39;t really remember learning  it.  I <br/>\njust see it and know, and when I try to break it down I  usually leave out <br/>\nsomething important.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe you could play things like &quot;name that tune&quot; with them.  Holly  and I <br/>\nwere doing that the other night.  She was in a rocking chair and I  was at the <br/>\npiano, so it wasn&#39;t Holly learning piano, but it was still fun.   I had a <br/>\nSesame Street songbook and would play two, then three, then four notes  until she <br/>\ncould guess the song.  Maybe they could copy each set of notes  you played, and <br/>\nyou add a note and they copy that and then soon they recognize  the song.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have done that with kids, just copying a bit they played, or singing  <br/>\nsomething they sang,  and then we turn it around and they copy  me.   It helps them <br/>\nknow how the instrument (keyboard or voice) works,  to find intervals, even <br/>\nwithout the names of those things being used.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-how to help him if he wants to play and learn one day, and then leave it  <br/>\nfor a few days, then play for a few days, and then leave it for a few  weeks.  <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI think quitting for a while and then coming back is fine and  natural.   <br/>\nPiano teachers traditionally want their students to advance  quickly so that the <br/>\nparents are happy with the cost of the lessons, and so they  can show off how <br/>\nmuch more advanced their students are than some other rival  teacher&#39;s.  <br/>\n(Traditionally in the for-centuries-passed way.)<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/certificate_\">http://sandradodd.com/certificate_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/certificate)\">http://sandradodd.com/certificate)</a> <br/>\nCertificate of empowerment.<br/>\nThis came up in e-mail to a friend who&#39;s not involved in unschooling,  <br/>\nbecause of a joke that was going around among friends of ours about finishing  <br/>\nthings you start:<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; Subject: inner peace<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am passing this on to you  because it definitely worked for me - and <br/>\n&gt; we all could use more calm in  our lives. By following the simple <br/>\n&gt; advice I heard on a<br/>\n&gt; Dr. Phil  show, I have finally have found inner peace.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dr. Phil  proclaimed the way to achieve inner peace is to finish all <br/>\n&gt; the things  you have started. So I looked around my house to see <br/>\n&gt; things I started  and hadn&#39;t finished; and, before leaving the house <br/>\n&gt; this morning I  finished off a<br/>\n&gt; bottle of Merlot, a bottle of White Zinfandel, a bottle  of Baileys, a<br/>\n&gt; bottle<br/>\n&gt; of Kahlua, a package of Oreos, the  remainder of both Prozac and Valium<br/>\n&gt; prescriptions, the rest of the  cheesecake, some Saltines and a box of<br/>\n&gt; Chocolates.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You  have no idea how freakin&#39; good I feel.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please pass this on to  those you feel are in need of inner  peace.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>----------------<br/>\n <br/>\nI think a lot of people hold in a lot of pain and regret about not  finishing <br/>\nthings.  I know my husband does.  Every unfinished project  since his <br/>\nchildhood is on a list of things he should feel bad about.  Poor  guy.  I told him if <br/>\nhe was having fun and learned something, it was fine  that he put it down <br/>\nwhen he wanted to.  When he quit he WAS done, maybe.  &lt;g&gt;  But with piano, <br/>\nquitting for a while isn&#39;t forever.   Picking up again isn&#39;t starting from scratch.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93086594,"authorName":"Sears Family","from":"&quot;Sears Family&quot; &lt;brewstersears@...&gt;","profile":"birthinlove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"helping almost 7 year old to learn piano","postDate":"1111067920","msgId":104598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzQwMWM1MmFmOSQ2YzgxZGIwMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBTRUFSU0M+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104600,"prevInTime":104597,"nextInTime":104599,"topicId":104598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I posted earlier about my ds (6, almost 7) wanting to read but not being ready yet.

The advice to liken it to learning to ride a bike was great - he happens to be exceptionally talented in sports, and has seen others struggle with sports and then succeed with much more effort/time than he has had to put forth.  Both him and I have become more patient and accepting of his learning to read at his own pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to learn how to play the piano, and he specifically wants me to help him.  I don&#39;t know what to do - I feel a big block as to how to help him - not because I don&#39;t know piano (I have my grade 8 conservatory and grade 2 theory), but I think because I&#39;m in the &quot;schooling&#39; mode from my own years and years of lessons. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have done piano in the past, in a schooly kind of way, where I&#39;ve set up fun exercises for them to do, and we&#39;ve tried to do something every day.  Although I always initiated the &quot;lessons&quot;, he was always keen about everything I did, where his sister disliked most of it.  Through the mixed responses I got, and my inner passion for unschooling (which obviously was not shining through with forcing her when she was losing interest) the &quot;lessons&#39; would drop off and we&#39;d stop doing them.  My ds doesn&#39;t complain, but if I ask him about it, he wants me to teach him and doesn&#39;t want another piano teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so stuck in how I learned how to play piano (lesson once a week, practise every day, learn notes/scales/chords/read music.....) that I&#39;m not sure how to unschool through this.  I mean - how to help him if he wants to play and learn one day, and then leave it for a few days, then play for a few days, and then leave it for a few weeks.   What materials/suggestions/path can I take without turning it into lessons we&#39;ll both not enjoy?<br/>\n<br/>\nArrghh - I&#39;m quite stuck, and looking forward to any suggestions!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104603,"nextTopicId":104550}}
