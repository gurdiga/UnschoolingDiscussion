So, I&#39;m an only and a youngest!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another (I love this story):<br/>\n<br/>\nMy adopted sister&#39;s biological mother was an identical twin. Both twins were impregnated by the same man within months of each other. The two resulting babies, my sister and her half-sister/cousin, didn&#39;t look especially alike, but despite the fact that they were raised apart, they share so many traits that you can really tell they&#39;re related.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11484,"nextTopicId":11139}}
