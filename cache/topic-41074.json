I am a distrubutor for Pampered Chef and Longaberger. I am able to work from home - but do home parties about once a week - and an occasional fair. Check out this website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thewahmconnection.com/\">http://www.thewahmconnection.com/</a> - it gives different ideas about work at home opporuntities. Whatever you do, there is no easy get rich quick way :) Mostly it is finding something you are good at - and finding a way to market yourself...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: sherri probus <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2002 3:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro and work at home<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n  My name is Sherri and I home educate my 10 y/o dd.  She has never been to a <br/>\n  ps and has never expressed the desire to give it a try.  Thank heaven.  I have a <br/>\n  15y/o ds who happens to attend ps because he lives with his Dad.  I wish I could<br/>\n  change that but his Dad is dead set against &quot;homeschooling&quot; because it will not<br/>\n  give a child the education that ps does.  HA HA!!!<br/>\n  I recently quit my job to be at home full time.  This is a scary experience.  I&#39;m not<br/>\n  sure that we can financially survive on just one income.  I have been searching on the net<br/>\n  for a legitimate work from home opportunity but I&#39;m leary of most everything I find.<br/>\n  Does anyone out there know of something that I could check out?  Any suggestions<br/>\n  would be greatly appreciated.  By the way, I live in Louisville, Ky.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Outgrown your current e-mail service?
