And I thought I had some nutso dogs!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one I remember the most was Maxie. A 30lb stray that jumped in the back <br/>\nof our van when we opened the door on an infamous FL stormy day. She was <br/>\nshaking like a leaf. We tried to find and owner and when none was found, she <br/>\nfound a home with us. The ppor thing, as described by a friend was said to <br/>\nlook like a bat with legs. She wasn&#39;t the most attractive little dog but <br/>\ndefinitely a lovey one. She was gross in what she liked to get into and we <br/>\nhad to watch especially around certain times of the month. (nuff said) And <br/>\nshe would never just go and lie down. You literally had to tell her to. She <br/>\nwould just stand.....for very long periods of time. Our house then was small <br/>\nand it got unerving to see her in the middle of the living room just <br/>\nstanding there while the cats and other two dogs were alseep. We would have <br/>\nto say Maxi, go and lay down and she would snap out of whatever coma she was <br/>\nin and then go and settle somewhere. The day she died in my arms, my husband <br/>\nand I both cried like babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Psycho dogs.","postDate":"1033580371","msgId":45107,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDAyLjExMzkzMi44MjguNi5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45160,"prevInTime":45106,"nextInTime":45108,"topicId":45107,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
