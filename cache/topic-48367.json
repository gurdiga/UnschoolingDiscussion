The supposedly bfing friendly dr told her at the *2 day* check<br/>\nup that the baby was nursing too frequently and to try to stretch out the feedings.<br/>\nI saw her at 3 days and noticed the baby rooting. Mom told me what the dr said and <br/>\ngave a paci. I tried to explain a bit about building up the supply and what I<br/>\nhad learned with my oldest. She didn&#39;t listen. At the 2week appt, the baby had<br/>\nnot gained back her weight, the dr suggested formula, baby gulped it down, the mom <br/>\ntried to pump got nothing and decided that she did not make enough milk. This<br/>\nthen made it easier to leave the baby. At 6 weeks, they left the baby overnight<br/>\nwith the grandparents so they could get some sleep. I could not IMAGINE being <br/>\naway from my 6 week old overnight! I am just trying to figure out if my almost<br/>\n3 yo will be ready in Dec and hubby and I can get a hotel room after the company<br/>\nchristmas party. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I am not saying that formula feeding always leads to more separation from the <br/>\nbaby (a very good friend of mine bottlefed her oldest two (limited supply due to<br/>\nbreast reduction which she was able to somewhat over come and nursed (with supplements<br/>\nher youngest for a year). But it sure as heck makes it easier.  Hubby&#39;s partner<br/>\nwas telling me last month or so that they were hoping the company made more money<br/>\nthis year, so that his wife could stay home more with their dd (and new baby born <br/>\nin Oct). I had to bite my tongue...I have been home for 3 years now and hubby and <br/>\nhis partner make the exact same salary. Our house is smaller, we don&#39;t go out to <br/>\nfancy dinners or vacations as much and we don&#39;t have half the debt that they do.<br/>\nBut we are in NO WAY deprived...we have a great house, a place at the beach<br/>\nand enough flexibility to not have to worry *too* much about money. It is scary, they<br/>\nlive on twice the income we do and a couple of years ago when the company had a cash<br/>\nflow issue, we lent the company the money to cover it because they did not have<br/>\nany available! Amazing to me....<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of my friends are surprised that I would want to homeschool and be at home<br/>\nwith my kids all day.
