I<br/>\nfigure the chances of the flight attendants having to subdue a passenger<br/>\non our flight is infinitesimal - the chances of us being in a fatal car<br/>\naccident on the drive to the airport are higher, as are the odds that<br/>\nwe&#39;ll see someone being subdued and restrained at our local supermarket. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe check-ins  didn&#39;t really take long at all. In Tucson we got to the<br/>\nairport 3 hours early but they wouldn&#39;t let us check in until 2 hours<br/>\nearly. There was no line. We played cards for a while, checked in (same<br/>\nroutine, although about one in 10 poeple were having all of their luggage<br/>\nsearched), went through the metal detector (we had to show ID and tickets<br/>\nagain here, but it didn&#39;t take long) then played cards and browsed in the<br/>\nshops until we got on the plane - which was on time - and had a pretty<br/>\nuneventful ride. On the way home a week later, there was a longer line,<br/>\nbut no longer than it usually is in Oakland. I decided at the last minute<br/>\nthat I probably shouldn&#39;t try to bring my knitting needles on the plane,<br/>\nso I stuck them in my checked bag. One woman ahead of us ended up<br/>\nthrowing away a pair of nail clippers because they weren&#39;t allowed in her<br/>\ncarry-on and she didn&#39;t want to check anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with whoever wrote about going on with our lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nDaron<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
