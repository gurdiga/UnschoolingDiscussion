But when it comes to letting a cat have a<br/>\n&gt; litter of kittens, I&#39;m being told, &quot;Don&#39;t let her do it!  Buy her a<br/>\n&gt; video or let her watch someone else&#39;s animals mate!&quot;  It seems that<br/>\n&gt; some are willing to look down on a &quot;fundamentalist Christian&quot; for not<br/>\n&gt; letting kids listen to secular music at the same time they encourage a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;politically correct&quot; forbidding of cat breeding. Do we let our kids<br/>\n&gt; do what their interests lead them to or not?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as the actual issue of a cat having kittens, I grew up with<br/>\n&gt; female cats who gave birth.  In my entire childhood we had only one<br/>\n&gt; cat who was not a good mother.  She eventually &quot;caught on&quot; and did<br/>\n&gt; nurse the kittens, but in the beginning we had to &quot;force&quot; her to go<br/>\n&gt; near her kittens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We NEVER had a hard time giving kittens away.  If we didn&#39;t get rid of<br/>\n&gt; all of them in the free ads, we found a farmer who was willing to take<br/>\n&gt; them.  Farmers often have lots of cats running around to scare off the<br/>\n&gt; mice.  They usually just throw a little bit of food and water out and<br/>\n&gt; let the cats fend for themselves. I have fond memories of visiting a<br/>\n&gt; friend&#39;s farm as a child and playing with his cats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I learned on this list was about the males spraying furniture.<br/>\n&gt; Our male cats at home were always neutered so that they wouldn&#39;t roam,<br/>\n&gt; so I really have no personal experience with un-neutered male cats.<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps we&#39;ll try to find a friend with a male cat to &quot;borrow&quot;. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve never actually seen a cat give birth because they usually hid to<br/>\n&gt; have their kittens.  The picture of my dad climbing the neighbor&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; apple tree to bring the kittens and proud mama home is forever<br/>\n&gt; engraved in my mind!  lol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I did, however, stay home from school the day it seemed my dog was<br/>\n&gt; going to have her puppies.  It turns out she did need &quot;help&quot;.  She<br/>\n&gt; acted like she didn&#39;t know what to do with the first puppy.  I had to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;make&quot; her lick it off.  She was still having the last of them when my<br/>\n&gt; dad got home from work.  I&#39;ll never forget him talking on the phone<br/>\n&gt; and looking up to see the dog running around the house with an<br/>\n&gt; umbilical cord still attached and a puppy&#39;s head hitting off the<br/>\n&gt; carpet!  He just calmly said to the person on the other end of the<br/>\n&gt; phone, &quot;Excuse me&quot;, and went over, pulled the dog out the rest of the<br/>\n&gt; way, and resumed his conversations!  She did end up being a good mama<br/>\n&gt; though, not only to her puppies but to a little kitten we had who<br/>\n&gt; decided to nurse from the dog too!  lol It was hilarious to see a dog<br/>\n&gt; nursing a litter full of puppies and--a kitten!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I know there are horror stories out there of animals having a hard<br/>\n&gt; time giving birth.  But you know what?  These are ANIMALS, not people.<br/>\n&gt;  There is a little rule that applies here called survival of the<br/>\n&gt; fittest.  The strong survive, the weak don&#39;t.  It&#39;s sad, but until the<br/>\n&gt; Lord creates a new heaven and earth and wipes out sin and death, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a fact of life.

But when it comes to letting a cat have a <br/>\nlitter of kittens, I&#39;m being told, &quot;Don&#39;t let her do it!  Buy her a <br/>\nvideo or let her watch someone else&#39;s animals mate!&quot;  It seems that <br/>\nsome are willing to look down on a &quot;fundamentalist Christian&quot; for not <br/>\nletting kids listen to secular music at the same time they encourage a <br/>\n&quot;politically correct&quot; forbidding of cat breeding. Do we let our kids <br/>\ndo what their interests lead them to or not?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the actual issue of a cat having kittens, I grew up with <br/>\nfemale cats who gave birth.  In my entire childhood we had only one <br/>\ncat who was not a good mother.  She eventually &quot;caught on&quot; and did <br/>\nnurse the kittens, but in the beginning we had to &quot;force&quot; her to go <br/>\nnear her kittens. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe NEVER had a hard time giving kittens away.  If we didn&#39;t get rid of <br/>\nall of them in the free ads, we found a farmer who was willing to take <br/>\nthem.  Farmers often have lots of cats running around to scare off the <br/>\nmice.  They usually just throw a little bit of food and water out and <br/>\nlet the cats fend for themselves. I have fond memories of visiting a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s farm as a child and playing with his cats. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I learned on this list was about the males spraying furniture.  <br/>\nOur male cats at home were always neutered so that they wouldn&#39;t roam, <br/>\nso I really have no personal experience with un-neutered male cats. <br/>\nPerhaps we&#39;ll try to find a friend with a male cat to &quot;borrow&quot;. ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never actually seen a cat give birth because they usually hid to <br/>\nhave their kittens.  The picture of my dad climbing the neighbor&#39;s <br/>\napple tree to bring the kittens and proud mama home is forever <br/>\nengraved in my mind!  lol <br/>\n<br/>\nI did, however, stay home from school the day it seemed my dog was <br/>\ngoing to have her puppies.  It turns out she did need &quot;help&quot;.  She <br/>\nacted like she didn&#39;t know what to do with the first puppy.  I had to <br/>\n&quot;make&quot; her lick it off.  She was still having the last of them when my <br/>\ndad got home from work.  I&#39;ll never forget him talking on the phone <br/>\nand looking up to see the dog running around the house with an <br/>\numbilical cord still attached and a puppy&#39;s head hitting off the <br/>\ncarpet!  He just calmly said to the person on the other end of the <br/>\nphone, &quot;Excuse me&quot;, and went over, pulled the dog out the rest of the <br/>\nway, and resumed his conversations!  She did end up being a good mama <br/>\nthough, not only to her puppies but to a little kitten we had who <br/>\ndecided to nurse from the dog too!  lol It was hilarious to see a dog <br/>\nnursing a litter full of puppies and--a kitten!  <br/>\n<br/>\n I know there are horror stories out there of animals having a hard <br/>\ntime giving birth.  But you know what?  These are ANIMALS, not people. <br/>\n There is a little rule that applies here called survival of the <br/>\nfittest.  The strong survive, the weak don&#39;t.  It&#39;s sad, but until the <br/>\nLord creates a new heaven and earth and wipes out sin and death, it&#39;s <br/>\na fact of life.

They are trying to make people <br/>\nresponsible for their pets so that our jobs are easier in rescue.  If <br/>\npeople got their animals spayed and neutered, there would be no real need <br/>\nfor rescue groups anymore.  Some countries do not have them as they <br/>\nregulate animal husbandry so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur contracts have the same thing on it about taking the dogs back if not <br/>\nspay/neutered on time and if that and the shots are not done, you could be <br/>\nfined $150 dollars...it is a protection to the animals who have already <br/>\nbeen through a lot in their life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 10:39 PM 12/13/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I tried to do that once when dd wanted a kitten.

You&#39;re either looking for<br/>\na Golden Retriever or a yellow Labrador Retriever (they also come in black<br/>\nand chocolate).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny (sane) dog can meet the criteria you&#39;ve listed -- with training. How<br/>\nmuch training varies breed to breed and individual to individual. Once in a<br/>\nblue moon you will run across a dog who seems to have been born trained. You<br/>\nwill run though a lot of dogs looking for that dog, so I&#39;d advise being well<br/>\nprepared and well educated to train one yourself, instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding a dog to the family is somewhat like adding another child. And as all<br/>\nus Moms should know, when another child enters the household (even a<br/>\nfour-legged one) we&#39;re going to be doing the bulk of the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29223,"nextTopicId":30044}}
