I know when I was starting out on my unschooling journey, the more I read there and here--the better.  As you get more and more information in your own head and feel more comfortable,  dealing with quesions does get easier.  It does take some time though.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  I also think that in the beginning when answering people&#39;s questions,  less can sometimes be best.   If someone asks how the home &#39;schooling&#39;  is going,  I would just say that its going great and you&#39;re amazed at how much the kids are learning!  You don&#39;t have to go into the entire explanation of unschooling or John Holt.   I did that a few times and the people ended up looking like a deer in the headlights.  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve learned to be selective with whom I share the details.  I know alot of times people just ask because they don&#39;t have the &quot;how is school going&quot; question to ask.    As you get more comfortable with what you are doing and feel more at ease with talking about it, go for it.   Especially if someone genuinely wants to know details.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Now, what confuses me is the fact that other people that have claimed to<br/>\n  &gt; unschool talk about using books and all the work they are getting done.<br/>\n  &gt; Should <br/>\n  &gt; I or should I not use books, when they are ready of course?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  An example of how we were using a book yesterday.   Which I would never have guessed we would be doing. :)<br/>\n  We ended up reading Macbeth!  My 9 yr old dd and I!  At her request.   How does that happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n  We started with playing &#39;go fish&#39;.    We had just received a new deck of cards as a gift from a friend who had been to London.  They were cards with pictures of flowers on them.  The flowers were flowers that have been used in lines of Shakespears plays.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So we are playing go fish and Abbi decides that each time you draw a new card or when you have a card someone asks for, you have to read the quote and the other person has to guess what Shakespeare play its from.  (Her idea)  I&#39;m like,,, OK.   I think she&#39;s maybe familiar with 4 Shakespeare plays right now, so I&#39;m hesistant (inside me) because she won&#39;t know many names to guess.   But that&#39;s OK,  I just go with it.    We had so much fun.  :)    I did study Shakespeare in college so I&#39;m somewhat familiar with the plays.  So when she&#39;s read me one and we&#39;d come to the play, we&#39;d talk about what it was about.  (If I could remember)  Most of the quotes I had no idea, though.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway,  we came to a quote from Macbeth,  &quot;Root of hemlock digg&#39;d i&#39; the dark&quot; (and there&#39;s a pic. of hemlock on the card)  and I thought that was from the witches as they are stirring their cauldron.   We go and google Shakespeare plays and find a website with lines from all the plays.   Look up Macbeth and there ya go,  there&#39;s the witches,  as she is reading through the witches scene,  (which is so fun to do,  cackling and all)   we had a really cool connection happen,,,,   <br/>\n<br/>\n  She sees the lines,   &quot;Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and Cauldron bubble.&quot;    She stops and thinks,  hmmm and I&#39;m also stopping and thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Earlier we had been downloading the trailer to the new Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban,  we had seen it in the theater when we went to the Looney Tunes movie and wanted to see it again.     Well,,,,did you know that there&#39;s Shakespeare in Harry Potter?  There&#39;s a choir singing &quot;Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and Cauldron bubble&quot;  over and over and then they also have,  &quot;Something wicked this way comes&quot;  which is from the same scene in Macbeth!    Blew me over,  it was so cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So of course we had to go and download the trailer again and listen to the music some more!<br/>\n<br/>\n  As we are doing that, Abbi decides she wants to read through the whole play of Macbeth.   She wants to divide up the parts and take turns reading through it.  I tell her I think I still have my Complete Works of Shakepeare  up above the garage in storage and she is soooo excited!   But she says we first have to finish our &#39;go fish&#39; game. &lt;g&gt;  After go fish,  we go and dig out the Shakespeare book and...  there you have it,   we ended up sitting, reading Macbeth last night.   I was amazed at how much she was understanding and how she sat there with her finger on each word as she read.  Also,  she wanted the Macbeth part!  Lots of hard reading.  There is so much to learn in reading Shakespeare,  wow!   The style of writing and speaking for one,  the history,   we looked up a ton of words.  Ones that I didn&#39;t know either.   A dictionary is another book we use,  alot!  We did that for 2 hours and will be finishing it today.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So yes,  unschoolers do use books,  its just when they want to use them.  :))<br/>\n<br/>\n  Have a fun day in your new unschooling life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~  <br/>\n<br/>\n  PS.

Make sure there are books around that they could<br/>\nenjoy if they were interested. Rotate new ones from the library so they&#39;re<br/>\navailable even if they doesn&#39;t read them. Offer occasionally a snuggle on<br/>\nthe couch or in bed to read to them. Listen to books on tape. Get magazines<br/>\nand books that deal with the subjects they&#39;re interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do mean textbooks and doing school work ... Lots of people use the<br/>\nword unschooling to mean relaxed homeschooling or eclectic. Maybe the kids<br/>\nget to pick how they&#39;re going to do math, or they encourage activities that<br/>\nlook like academic activities, but the focus is on getting academics into a<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here we discuss it as John Holt did, which is helping a child explore<br/>\nhis or her interests and running the world through their lives so they have<br/>\nopportunities to expand their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the concept of being ready for textbooks is foreign.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoodness! I&#39;m not even sure where to begin! Unschooling is about doing and<br/>\nliving and pursuing interests. Learning happens as a side effect. It&#39;s like<br/>\nworking on a huge mural of your own design and filling in the details as you<br/>\ncome to them and need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning from a textbook is turning that process upside down. It&#39;s like<br/>\nworking on details here and there without any idea of what the mural looks<br/>\nlike or any say so in what it will be. It&#39;s working on the details of an eye<br/>\nof something and then moving onto the details of the bark of something and<br/>\nthen moving onto the a piece of a rock and so on. It&#39;s all rigorous and<br/>\ndetailed but it&#39;s all meaningless because the pieces don&#39;t connect to each<br/>\nother or anything larger. And the more meaningless and disconnected<br/>\nsomething is, the less interesting it is and the less likely someone will<br/>\nwant to explore it further -- or even retain it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems my brother in law has already decided his son is not<br/>\n&gt; going to come around my kids anymore, and when my boys saw their uncle they<br/>\n&gt; got 50 questions shoved down their throat.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s good that he&#39;s going to stay away so they aren&#39;t bombarded with 50<br/>\nquestions! If he does break his word and questions them, you can tell him<br/>\nnot to corner the kids any more. If he has questions to ask you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s probably scared and feels threatened by your decision. That might help<br/>\nyou see his behavior in a new light. (Understanding doesn&#39;t mean you need to<br/>\nput up with it, though!) He is probably terrified that getting kids to turn<br/>\nout right and getting them what they need is just so chancy that anything<br/>\nthat makes him question the choices he&#39;s making for them is going to be<br/>\nupsetting. Basically people who send their kids to school have to trust that<br/>\nthe school can give kids what they need. Most people have a decent amount of<br/>\nconfidence that it is so. But if someone feels their confidence rattled (say<br/>\nby troubling reports of schools) and that alternatives are even worse -- if<br/>\nexperts are doing such a poor job, then what does that say for amateurs like<br/>\nmothers trying to teach their kids! -- then they have to stuff their fears<br/>\ndown and just hope for the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy your homeschooling you&#39;re throwing it in his face that you&#39;re so lacking<br/>\nconfidence in schools that you&#39;re willing to do it yourself, despite a lack<br/>\nof professional training. Your actions are letting his fears come to the<br/>\nsurface and he doesn&#39;t want that. He wants to keep them stuffed down because<br/>\nfacing them is overwhelming and something he doesn&#39;t feel he has the ability<br/>\nto tackle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Hello, New and confused.......","postDate":"1068918647","msgId":84836,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Ny4yMjRhMzRlYy4yY2U3YzE3N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84832,"nextInTopic":84914,"prevInTime":84835,"nextInTime":84837,"topicId":84791,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/14/03 9:32:08 PM, danielle.conger@comcast.net writes:  Just for the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1662563933\">In a message dated 11/14/03 9:32:08 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielle.conger@...\">danielle.conger@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So much of unschooling and TCS (Taking Children Seriously) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for the record, this isn&#39;t a TCS list.<br/>\nA google search (or maybe someone here who has the link handy) could get you <br/>\nthere, but they&#39;re doing a particular thing elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Hello, New and confused.......","postDate":"1068917460","msgId":84832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJwNW5zaytwZHFuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjYuMC4yMDAzMTExNDIxMzkxOS4wMGE5YTEwOEBtYWlsLmNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":84831,"nextInTopic":84836,"prevInTime":84831,"nextInTime":84833,"topicId":84791,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... along with you, but I think that it s the struggle that matters in the end.

This came after a very bad<br/>\n&gt; start to being in school this year for my 10 year old, and finally pulling<br/>\nmy 5<br/>\n&gt; year old out after a few weeks. Even though at the time all seemed well<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; him.  I have spent the past 2 months researching and reading (mostly John<br/>\nHolt)<br/>\n&gt; about unschooling.  I feel this would fit so well into our life now that<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; quit my job to be home with my guys.  And wow, after 3 weeks, it feels so<br/>\ngood<br/>\n&gt; to be home.  I am trying to get myself to R E L A X and not jump into<br/>\nbooks,<br/>\n&gt; push the pc or anything else.  In other words I feel we are going thru the<br/>\n&gt; adjustment period.<br/>\n&gt;   Now, what confuses me is the fact that other people that have claimed to<br/>\n&gt; unschool talk about using books and all the work they are getting done.<br/>\nShould<br/>\n&gt; I or should I not use books, when they are ready of course?  And the<br/>\nholidays<br/>\n&gt; are coming up.  It seems my brother in law has already decided his son is<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; going to come around my kids anymore, and when my boys saw their uncle<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; got 50 questions shoved down their throat.  &quot;why aren&#39;t you in school?&quot;<br/>\nand so<br/>\n&gt; on and so on.

I know, I joined this list today and it said not to write <br/>\nfor a few weeks, but it seems there are so many members and Sandra on here that <br/>\nI just could not wait for some input!<br/>\n  We JUST started our journey of unschooling. This came after a very bad <br/>\nstart to being in school this year for my 10 year old, and finally pulling my 5 <br/>\nyear old out after a few weeks. Even though at the time all seemed well with <br/>\nhim.  I have spent the past 2 months researching and reading (mostly John Holt) <br/>\nabout unschooling.  I feel this would fit so well into our life now that I&#39;ve <br/>\nquit my job to be home with my guys.  And wow, after 3 weeks, it feels so good <br/>\nto be home.  I am trying to get myself to R E L A X and not jump into books, <br/>\npush the pc or anything else.  In other words I feel we are going thru the <br/>\nadjustment period.<br/>\n  Now, what confuses me is the fact that other people that have claimed to <br/>\nunschool talk about using books and all the work they are getting done.  Should <br/>\nI or should I not use books, when they are ready of course?  And the holidays <br/>\nare coming up.  It seems my brother in law has already decided his son is not <br/>\ngoing to come around my kids anymore, and when my boys saw their uncle they <br/>\ngot 50 questions shoved down their throat.  &quot;why aren&#39;t you in school?&quot;  and so <br/>\non and so on.  Someone even asked me, well, how do you think homeschooling is <br/>\ngoing to work for you? (I didn&#39;t DARE say we would be unschooling!)<br/>\n  What I really need is some advice on how to handle the questions that are <br/>\nsurely to come over the next few months.  Most of our families are behind us <br/>\n100% , but like their uncle, he could care less and doesn&#39;t mind letting us or <br/>\nthe boys know it.<br/>\n  I am also concerned about how long to let them de-school, for lack of a <br/>\nbetter word for it.  The period from leaving school till ????  I feel like i&#39;m <br/>\nneglecting them for not sitting them down every day and &quot;teaching&quot; even though I <br/>\ncan see and do keep track daily of the things we do , just in our daily <br/>\nlives.  People keep asking me . how was school?  What did you do today? OOOOOO, I <br/>\nhave tried to explain the reason for not schooling at the moment, no one really <br/>\nlistens.  But then, 2 months ago I didn&#39;t understand any of it myself.  <br/>\n  Maybe I just needed someone to listen to me on here that would <br/>\nunderstand??!!!!!  <br/>\nSomeone even told me I would never be able to teach my 5 year old how to <br/>\nread!  Ha!  I taught myself how to read before I was put in school!  It isn&#39;t to <br/>\nme that big of a deal.  <br/>\n  So, hear I sit.  Depressed again this week getting down on myself for not <br/>\ndoing more.  Am I doing this right?  We have lots of books to read, and i do <br/>\nread to Isaiah every night.  Kaleb, on the other hand, could care less about a <br/>\nbook in  his  hands!<br/>\n  help help help<br/>\nSyndi in missouri!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget that he<br/>\nis someone today.<br/>\nStacie Tauscher<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84955,"nextTopicId":84961}}
