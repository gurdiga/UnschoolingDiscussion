I was going through a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book I got at the library which lists accredited colleges in the U.S. and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Canada that have off-campus/long distance learning with degrees available.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Goddard was one of them so I did a search on the Internet and was really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surprised to read about them.  They sound like a perfect unschooler&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; college.  The learning is very self-directed and the on-campus classes are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; small discussion groups with teachers acting instead as &quot;facilitators.&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt; am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really excited about this school.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     Lucy in Calif.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4755,"nextTopicId":4789}}
