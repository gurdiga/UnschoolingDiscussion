Well, we figured that in order to get finished in time, we<br/>\n&gt; need to work some during the day, even when dh isn&#39;t home to watch<br/>\n&gt; the boys (ages 5 and 3).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think they&#39;re just too young and it&#39;s just too boring, and the &quot;do this<br/>\nfor me and I&#39;ll do that for you&quot; is too long. At 5 and 3 it might work if<br/>\nyou&#39;re asking them to pick up their socks :) but not to ride quietly for<br/>\nlong stretches of time in a wagon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any homeschooling families you know who might take them (and might<br/>\neven have older kids who would be interested in going along to help with the<br/>\npetition?) Are there maybe much-older kids (or adults) in town, of families<br/>\nyou know who also don&#39;t want the scooter law to pass, who would be<br/>\ninterested in going with your daughter while you stay home with the boys?<br/>\n<br/>\nCould your husband take your daughter to someplace central and busy like the<br/>\nmall or outside the grocery store when he gets home from work (or you take<br/>\nher while he stays with the boys) so instead of you going to the people they<br/>\nbasically come to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48542,"nextTopicId":48385}}
