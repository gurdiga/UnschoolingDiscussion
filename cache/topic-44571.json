If you spend time with home schoolers, you get a sense that some<br/>\nof them have missed out on whole swaths of childhood; the admirable efforts<br/>\nby their parents to ensure their education and safety sometimes seem to<br/>\nhave gone too far. In 1992 psychotherapist Larry Shyers did a study while at<br/>\nthe University of Florida in which he closely examined the behavior of 35 home<br/>\nschoolers and 35 public schoolers. He found that home schoolers were<br/>\ngenerally more patient and less competitive. They tended to introduce<br/>\nthemselves to one another more; they didn&#39;t fight as much. And the home<br/>\nschoolers were much more prone to exchange addresses and phone numbers.<br/>\nIn short, they behaved like miniature adults. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Time Magazine cover article, August 2001 - Seceding from school<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010827/index.html\">http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010827/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kids today are missing some essential social skills for relating to each <br/>\nother.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t know how to introduce themselves to other kids.

Gyllenhaal<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Islands of expertise&quot; is a term coined by Kevin Crowley, Ph.D., an <br/>\neducational <br/>\nresearcher at University of Pittsburgh who studies the ways that children and <br/>\nparents learn together in museums ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kevincrowley.com\">http://www.kevincrowley.com</a> ). It refers <br/>\nto the areas of relatively deep and rich knowledge children develop when they <br/>\nare passionately interested in something like dinosaurs, Pok√©mon, rocks, <br/>\nturtles and other things. These islands emerge over weeks or months as <br/>\nchildren talk, read and learn about their passions. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn their islands of expertise, children remember, reason and explain in more <br/>\nadvanced ways than they usually do when submerged in the wider sea of <br/>\nknowledge. Even preschoolers can think more like an expert does, which is <br/>\nvery <br/>\ndifferent from a beginner&#39;s approach to the subject. I guess you could also <br/>\nsay <br/>\nthey think more like an adult, growing up faster on their island than in the <br/>\nrest <br/>\nof their lives. (Just the opposite of Peter Pan.) <br/>\n<br/>\nCrowley emphasizes that children aren&#39;t alone on their islands. They build <br/>\nand <br/>\ninhabit them with their parents through the things they do together every <br/>\nday. <br/>\nPreschoolers especially need their parents&#39; help...<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the rest of this wonderful article at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://saltthesandbox.org/ChicagoParentArticle2.htm\">http://saltthesandbox.org/ChicagoParentArticle2.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEric Gyllenhaal has a PhD in paleontology from the University of Chicago. <br/>\nHe&#39;s <br/>\ncurrently a stay-at-home dad and a part-time museum consultant.

When she finally explained that <br/>\npaying<br/>\nfor the information meant that she would learn, I stopped protesting. It was<br/>\nmy first exposure to this sort of thinking. I did not understand it, but I <br/>\nwanted<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were both good riders who&#39;d learned &quot;the old way&quot; and they wanted to<br/>\nimprove. They pressed me to share with them anything I knew about learning<br/>\nhow-to-relearn to ride. I told them I also had questions--more questions than <br/>\nI<br/>\nhad answers. This struck me as a good opportunity to ferret out some<br/>\nanswers, so I started researching this article right then. It began with a <br/>\nshort<br/>\ninterview and a few days later I interviewed three more people we knew. It was<br/>\na simple interview: one question. &quot;Do you like learning?&quot; Their five unanimous<br/>\nanswers stunned me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all answered with the question: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Diamond writing for The Trail Less Traveled<br/>\nRead the rest of this fascinating article at: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lesliedesmond.com/articles/us/horse13-4.asp\">http://www.lesliedesmond.com/articles/us/horse13-4.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nGroup Functions<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I can no longer stand group outings with other families.

If you <br/>\ntook <br/>\na class of twenty-five first-graders and researched what really turned them <br/>\non, you&#39;d find that each boy and girl has a burning desire to learn more <br/>\nabout <br/>\nsomething. One child may be curious about birds, another might have all sorts <br/>\nof questions about the planets, and a third might be fascinated by cars. On a <br/>\nmore general level, we know the areas that children are eager to explore and <br/>\nlearn about: why people treat them the way they do, their own bodies, sports, <br/>\nhow to make things, drawing, music, and so on. Very few children, however, <br/>\nare naturally curious about the subjects school forces them to learn. Most <br/>\nkids don&#39;t have an intense curiosity about Dickens, state capitals, or <br/>\nalgorithms.<br/>\n<br/>\n...This is the problem with school and curiosity. Most kids only ask <br/>\nquestions <br/>\nabout the subjects they&#39;re being taught out of a sense of &quot;duty&quot; or because <br/>\nthey&#39;re worried they&#39;ll be criticized or downgraded, not because they&#39;re <br/>\nreally <br/>\ncurious about the answers. In fact, school tends to answer questions kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t have rather than the ones they want answered. When you don&#39;t have <br/>\nquestions about a subject, you don&#39;t learn. You simply memorize, take the <br/>\ntest, and forget.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeartfelt questions, then, are a manifestation of inquisitiveness. When your <br/>\nchild starts asking you a million question about a specific topic, this <br/>\nidentifies <br/>\na real area of interest. The fact that he&#39;s curious about something weird or <br/>\ntrivial -- why cats land on their feet when dropped off the balcony, or the <br/>\nsmell, texture, and taste of coffee beans -- is neither here nor there. No <br/>\nmatter where curiosity originates, it&#39;s a valid starting point, which as <br/>\nwe&#39;ll see <br/>\ncan lead to other, more &quot;useful&quot; areas of inquiry.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions, however, aren&#39;t the only form curiosity takes. People express <br/>\ntheir <br/>\ncuriosity through different behaviors. A teenager, for instance, might drive <br/>\nfast because he&#39;s curious about how fast his car can go. A younger kid is <br/>\ncurious about what will happen if he invites the new student to his house for <br/>\nlunch. A chemist is curious about what might happen if he mixes the liquids <br/>\nin <br/>\ntest tubes X and Y. A kid is curious about what might happen if he fixes his <br/>\nbest friend up with the girl who sits next to him in math class. Picasso was <br/>\none <br/>\nof the most curious of modern artists, constantly experimenting with his <br/>\npainting techniques. In a very real sense, inquisitiveness involves <br/>\nexperimentation. Like scientists, curious people are fascinated to see &quot;what <br/>\nwould happen if...&quot; An avant-garde musician experiments with different <br/>\ntonalities and instruments in the same way a small child experiments with <br/>\ndifferent types of balls to see how they bounce.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuriosity is a curious thing, especially when we probe beneath the surface of <br/>\nour questions and behaviors and see how it helps us learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoger Schank - from Coloring Outside the Lines - Raising a Smarter Kid By <br/>\nBreaking All the Rules (Harper Collins 2000)<br/>\nMr. Schank considers school mostly inescapable, thus the book is a treatise <br/>\non <br/>\nhow to minimize the damage school does to a child&#39;s intelligence. Unschoolers <br/>\nwill still find it a fascinating look at how learning happens, and full of <br/>\ncautionary tales -- what not to do to your children in the name of <br/>\n&quot;education&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nPhotographic Collections<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the best uses of the internet is as limitless exhibition space <br/>\n- <br/>\nthe infinite museum.

It is nearly impossible to <br/>\naccurately define unschooling, but foundationally it rests upon the idea that <br/>\nif <br/>\nyou provide a rich learning environment and plenty of opportunity, a child <br/>\nwill <br/>\nlearn what he needs to know when he needs to know it. Intellectually, my head <br/>\nwas nodding over this one; I knew it worked for me, personally, and could see <br/>\nwhere it would work for children too, especially considering the progress <br/>\nThomas had made during a year of NO SCHOOL. Not, mind you, that I would dare <br/>\ntry unschooling my own sons¬Öespecially since I was surrounded by people <br/>\n(mostly relatives) who questioned the legitimacy of our homeschooling anyway. <br/>\nI only saw it as being a really good thing for those who possessed the¬Ö <br/>\nwhatever it took¬Ö to actually do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Cardwell - Eclectic Homeschool Online columnist<br/>\nConfession Time<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eho.org/features/confession_time.htm\">http://eho.org/features/confession_time.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:+:<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers Helping Homeschoolers<br/>\nby Pam Sorooshian and Sue Patterson, NHEN<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, record numbers of families are choosing home education.
