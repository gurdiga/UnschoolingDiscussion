At 5 I would have <br/>\nnever let him go to a class without me in the room.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I think he&#39;s so fragile or whatever.  It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant him to pick up on the idea that his way of learning is inferior to the <br/>\nschool model, or that he can&#39;t own his own learning.  I certainly don&#39;t want <br/>\nhim to get the idea that any worksheet or other activity they ask him to do <br/>\nhas any bearing on his worth as a human being.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son attends the monthly homeschool science day at the science museum.  <br/>\nSince he&#39;s 9, and most of his friends are, I put him in the lower age group <br/>\nclass (1-3 grade).  Most of the other moms chose the upper age group for <br/>\ntheir kids.  He was disappointed that he wasn&#39;t with his friends, and the <br/>\nclasses were full so the museum wouldn&#39;t let him move up.  But he enjoyed it <br/>\nanyway and didn&#39;t complain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, one of his friends who doesn&#39;t read yet dropped out of the upper classes <br/>\naltogether and so we asked if my son could take his place.  He came out of <br/>\nthere so disappointed!  He had a worksheet in his hand, and was complaining <br/>\nabout how stupid it was and that the teacher went too fast when she told him <br/>\nwhat to write on it.  He was really frustrated.  I asked him if he wanted the <br/>\nworksheet, and he said no.  So I took it and crumpled it up and I said &quot;this <br/>\nworksheet means nothing. You never have to do them if you don&#39;t want to, <br/>\never.  It&#39;s simply a way for an uncreative teacher to make herself think <br/>\nshe&#39;s getting through to you some way.  Did you learn anything about what she <br/>\nwas saying?&quot;  yes.  &quot;Then you don&#39;t need a worksheet to tell you that.  Do <br/>\nyou want to go back to the older class next time?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No.  They don&#39;t do anything fun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I insulted the teacher, and in the midst of a whole bunch of other <br/>\nhomeschool moms milling about, too.

My son (age 5) is very interested in <br/>\nanimals and sea creatures so when the zoo here offered a class for <br/>\nhomeschoolers on ocean creatures, I asked him if he&#39;d like to go. He said <br/>\nyes. Our first class was today and he seemed comfortable there. Anyways, <br/>\napparently he was wandering around the room instead of sitting quietly and he <br/>\nwas listening to the teacher. The teacher suggested that next time I stay in <br/>\nthe room, presumably to keep him in his seat. I would like him to stay in the <br/>\nclass as he is interested in the subject and as long as he isn&#39;t disruptive, <br/>\nI don&#39;t see why he can&#39;t stand or wander. (By the way, the class is K-2nd <br/>\ngrade and he&#39;s the youngest and I do get the feeling that most of the kids do <br/>\nschool-at-home.)
