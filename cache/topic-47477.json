She was right next to me when he came up behind her (a <br/>\nbig guy about 6&#39; 4&quot;) in a cape with a monster mask and yelled &quot;Boo&quot; at her <br/>\nas loud as he could. She had tears running down her face. She cried and <br/>\ncried and he just walked back to the costume section where he put on another <br/>\nmask. I finally patted her on the back and gave her a toy to look at. She <br/>\nhad subsided down to muffled sobs when he came *back* in a different costume <br/>\nand scared her again. Her mom finally showed up and when I asked if scaring <br/>\nher to tears once<br/>\nwasn&#39;t maybe enough she ignored me and proceeded to tell her little girl <br/>\nthat she was &quot;so silly&quot; and &quot;not really crying&quot; and &quot;what a fuss about <br/>\nnothing little crybaby&quot; for the next ten minutes while the girl kept crying. <br/>\nGeeze Louise. How hard is is to figure out that a 3 year old maybe can&#39;t <br/>\nhandle that? Maybe a six or a seven year old might like being scared but <br/>\nscared to tears?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat poor little kid. Good for you in saying something. Last weekend when we <br/>\ntook the kids to the church carnival, we were waiting in line for a dragon <br/>\nroller coaster ride for the kids. There was this little boy maybe about 3 <br/>\nthat was sitting by himself and just terrified after the ride had started. <br/>\nHe was crying in such distress and stupid ass mom was just laughing away and <br/>\nwaving at him. I yelled out that the little kid was obviously not having a <br/>\ngood time and they needed to get him off. I really don&#39;t care if she asked <br/>\nthe operator to stop because she was embarrassed or not. She had them stop <br/>\nthe ride and then got him off. Other parents around were looking at me like <br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t believe I would say something, yet they all chimed in and <br/>\nagreed with me. Maybe by saying something and letting others hear it, they <br/>\nwill get the guts themselves to say something if they see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the same night, there were two kids that trampled through a line of us <br/>\nwaiting for a ride. One of those trampled was my Sierra who started to cry. <br/>\nShe got jostled quite violently and also stepped on. The boys were chasing <br/>\neach other and maybe about 9. I grabbed them and then my husband took care <br/>\nof the situation and the one kid apologized. All the parents just stood <br/>\naround and looked while their kids were at risk too. Too many problems are <br/>\nbecause people DON&#39;T say anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on that ride, when our kids got on, the operator was making the kids put <br/>\nup their arms when the ride dropped down. Sierra would on the way up, but <br/>\ngrabbed a hold of the bar on the way down. The operator, trying to be funny, <br/>\nsaid she wasn&#39;t going to operate the ride anymore unless everyone put up <br/>\ntheir hands. Sierra had an odd look on her face and I knew she didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto do it but didn&#39;t want to speak up either. I stood right next to the lady <br/>\nand looked right at Sierra and loudly said, &quot;You don&#39;t have to put your <br/>\nhands up just because she tells you to.&quot;&quot; The lady left her alone the rest <br/>\nof the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B (think you know what the B stands for??

That&#39;s not usually when they are there once a week. The he <br/>\nwas being offered banana&#39;s and doing great considering his age and someone <br/>\ntempting (my own word) him. Then he&#39;s not actually &quot;at&quot; their house but out <br/>\nwith them. No wonder we&#39;re all confused.

Here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra said this ~~&gt;&gt;&gt; If everyone looks the other way and the child is <br/>\nafraid to report it, why <br/>\nÂ  Â  will he want to stop?<br/>\n<br/>\nÂ  Â  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said this in response ~~&gt;&gt;** Because he&#39;s a parent and the majority of <br/>\nparents want what is best for <br/>\nÂ  their kids.

According to Myranda, people who abuse probably just want <br/>\nwhat&#39;s best for their families. <br/>\n<br/>\nI checked the references listed, for the first site, and all were from 1998 <br/>\nor newer and most were from 2001 or newer.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncvc.org/stats/ca_csa.htm&quot;\">http://www.ncvc.org/stats/ca_csa.htm&quot;</a>&gt;Statistics: Child Abuse and Child Sexual Abuse - (National Center for <br/>\nVictims of Crime)&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nStatistics: Child Abuse and Child Sexual Abuse <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAn estimated 984,000 children were victims of maltreatment nationwide in <br/>\n1998.Of these,53.5 percent suffered neglect;2.4 percent were medically <br/>\nneglected;22.7 percent were physically abused;and 6 percent were emotionally <br/>\nmaltreated (U.S.Department of Health and Human Services, Children âs Bureau, <br/>\n2000). <br/>\nThe rate of child maltreatment in 1998 was 12.9 per thousand children in the <br/>\npopulation (Ibid). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1998,approximately 103,845 children were sexually abused;sexual abuse of <br/>\nchildren occurred at the rate of 1.49 children per thousand (Ibid). <br/>\nFive to fifteen percent of all males,and fifteen to thirty percent of all <br/>\nfemales report some type of exposure to child sexual abuse (Brown, 2000). <br/>\n<br/>\nBased on reports to law enforcement,children under 12 constituted roughly 50 <br/>\npercent of all victims of forcible sodomy,sexual assault with object,and <br/>\nforcible fondling (Snyder, 2000). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe results of the 1999 annual survey by Prevent Child Abuse show that 41 <br/>\npercent of the parents reported having spanked or hit their child during the <br/>\npast 12 months,38 percent said they had sworn at or insulted the child,and 51 <br/>\npercent indicated that they had failed to meet the child âs emotional <br/>\nneeds.Two percent of the respondents reported kicking,biting, or punching <br/>\ntheir child,while six percent said they had hit their child with an object <br/>\n(Daro,1999).<br/>\n <br/>\nChildren (ages 17 and younger) are more likely to be kidnaped by <br/>\nacquaintances who are not family members than by complete strangers.In 49 <br/>\npercent of the juvenile abductions,family members were responsible. About 27 <br/>\npercent involve non-family acquaintances,and 24 percent were attributed to <br/>\nstrangers (Finkelhor, Kidnaping, 2000). <br/>\n<br/>\nA longitudinal comparative study of 1,575 people,908 of which were abused or <br/>\nneglected in childhood,and the remainder of which were the control <br/>\ngroup,shows that the abuse/neglected group scored significantly lower on an <br/>\nIQ scale,held significantly more menial and semiskilled jobs, had 1.6 times <br/>\nhigher odds of committing crimes as adults,and were significantly more likely <br/>\nto have attempted asuicide and developed antisocial personality disorders <br/>\n(Widom, 2000).  <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\nIf this wasn&#39;t convincing, read on! <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yesican.org/statisticsCA.html&quot;\">http://www.yesican.org/statisticsCA.html&quot;</a>&gt;CHILD ABUSE STATISTICS&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\nCHILD ABUSE In 1999, an estimated 3,244,000 children were reported to Child <br/>\nProtective Services (CPS) agencies as alleged victims of child maltreatment.  <br/>\nChild abuse reports have maintained a steady growth for the past ten years, <br/>\nwith the total number of reports nationwide increasing 45% since 1987 (Nation <br/>\nCommittee for the Prevention of Child Abuse (NCPCA) 2000 Annual Fifty State <br/>\nSurvey). Neglect represents the most common type of reported and <br/>\nsubstantiated form of maltreatment.  In 1996, 25 states provided the <br/>\nfollowing breakdown for reported cases: 62% involved neglect, 25% physical <br/>\nabuse, 7% sexual abuse, 3% emotional maltreatment and 4% other.  For <br/>\nsubstantiated cases, 31 states gave the following breakdowns: 60% neglect, <br/>\n23% physical, 9% sexual, 4% emotional maltreatment and 5% other (NCPCA&#39;s 1996 <br/>\nAnnual Fifty State Survey). In 1999, an estimated 1,401 child abuse and <br/>\nneglect related fatalities were confirmed by CPS agencies, nearly 4 every day<br/>\n.  Since 1985, the rate of child abuse fatalities has increased by 39%.  <br/>\nBased on these numbers, more than three children die each day as a result of <br/>\nchild abuse or neglect (NCPCA&#39;s 1996 Annual Fifty State Survey).  According <br/>\nto information from at least 18 states that were able to report the type of <br/>\nmaltreatment which caused the child&#39;s death for at least one of the past <br/>\nthree years. Approximately 54% of the deaths were due to physical abuse while <br/>\n43% resulted from neglect. Young children remain at high risk for loss of <br/>\nlife. Based on data from all three years, this study found 82% of these <br/>\nchildren were under the age of five while an alarming 42% were under the age <br/>\nof one at the time of their death (NCPCA&#39;s 1996 Annual Fifty State Survey).<br/>\nThe U.S. Advisory Board reported that near fatal abuse and neglect each year <br/>\nleave &quot;18,000 permanently disabled children, tens of thousands of victims <br/>\noverwhelmed by lifelong psychological trauma, thousands of traumatized <br/>\nsiblings and family members, and thousands of near-death survivors who, as <br/>\nadults, continue to bear the physical and psychological scars. Some may turn <br/>\nto crime or domestic violence or become abusers themselves (U.S. Advisory <br/>\nBoard on Child Abuse and Neglect, 1995 report, A National&#39;s Shame.)&quot;The Third <br/>\nNational Incidence Study (NIS-3) of child maltreatment released by the <br/>\nNational Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) in the fall of 1996.The <br/>\nNIS is congressionally mandated under the Child Abuse Prevention and <br/>\nTreatment Act (CAPTA). The NIS collects data on children who were <br/>\ninvestigated by child protective services (CPS) agencies and on children seen <br/>\nby community professionals who were not reported to CPS or who were screened <br/>\nout by CPS without investigation. The NIS studies have been published on data <br/>\ncollected in 1979 (NIS-1), in 1986 (NIS-2), and in 1993 (NIS-3).The NIS uses <br/>\ntwo definitions of child maltreatment: the Harm Standard, under which <br/>\nchildren are counted as maltreated only if they have already experienced <br/>\ndemonstrable harm; and the Endangerment Standard, under which children are <br/>\ncounted if they have experienced maltreatment that puts them at risk of <br/>\ndemonstrable harm. The NIS-3 gathered data from a nationally representative <br/>\nsample of 5,612 community professionals in 842 agencies serving 42 <br/>\ncounties.Finding of the NIS-3:<br/>\nThe estimated number of children seriously injured by all forms of <br/>\nmaltreatment quadrupled between 1986 and 1993, from 141,700 to 565,000 (a <br/>\n299% increase). <br/>\nConsidering the Harm Standard: <br/>\nThe estimated number of sexually abused children increased 83%; <br/>\nThe number of physically neglected children rose 102%; <br/>\nThere was a 333 % increase in the estimated number of emotionally neglected <br/>\nchildren; and <br/>\nThe estimated number of physically abused children rose 42%.<br/>\nCPS investigated only 28% of children whose maltreatment met the Harm <br/>\nStandard. <br/>\nAlthough the percentage of children whose abuse or neglect was investigated <br/>\ndeclined, the actual number of children investigated remained constant. <br/>\nCPS investigated only 26 percent of the seriously injured and 26 percent of <br/>\nthe moderately injured children. <br/>\nGirls are sexually abused three times more often than boys. <br/>\n Boys are at a greater risk of serious injury and of emotional neglect than <br/>\nare girls. <br/>\n The incidence of fatally injured girls declined slightly, while the <br/>\nincidence of fatally injured boys rose. <br/>\n Found no race differences in maltreatment incidence. <br/>\n Poverty is significantly related to incidence rates in nearly every category <br/>\nof maltreatment. Compared to children whose families earned $30,000 or more, <br/>\nchildren in families with annual incomes below $15,000 were: <br/>\nMore than 22 times more likely to experience maltreatment under the Harm <br/>\nStandard and 25 times more likely under the Endangerment Standard. <br/>\nMore than 44 times more likely to be neglected, by either definitional <br/>\nstandard. <br/>\nOver 22 times more likely to be seriously injured using either definitional <br/>\nstandard. <br/>\n60 times more likely to die from maltreatment under the Harm <br/>\nStandard.(Executive Summary of the Third National Incidence Study of Child <br/>\nAbuse and Neglect, September 1996 and Reid, T. (1996). News NIS-3 Data. APSAC <br/>\nAdvisor, 9 (3).) <br/>\nChildren whose parents abuse drugs or alcohol are put at a greater risk for <br/>\nviolent victimization (National Commission on Children, 1993). <br/>\nWith the exception of homicide, children and youths suffer more victimization <br/>\nthan do adults in virtually every category, including physical abuse, sibling <br/>\nassault, bullying, sexual abuse, and rape (American Psychological Association <br/>\nCommission on Violence and Youth, 1993). <br/>\nIt is estimated that children with disabilities are 4 to 10 times more <br/>\nvulnerable to sexual abuse than their non-disabled peers (National Resource <br/>\nCenter on Child Sexual Abuse, 1992). <br/>\nIn over 9000 divorces in 12 states, child sexual abuse allegations were made <br/>\nin less then 2% of contested divorces involving child custody (Association of <br/>\nFamily Conciliation Courts, 1990). Survivors:It is estimated that there are <br/>\n60 million survivors of childhood sexual abuse in America today (Forward, <br/>\n1993)Long term effects of child abuse include fear, anxiety, depression, <br/>\nanger, hostility, inappropriate sexual behavior, poor self esteem, tendency <br/>\ntoward substance abuse and difficulty with close relationships (Browne & <br/>\nFinkelhor, 1986). <br/>\nClinical findings of adult victims of sexual abuse include problems in <br/>\ninterpersonal relationships associated with an underlying mistrust. <br/>\nGenerally, adult victims of incest have a severely strained relationship with <br/>\ntheir parents that is marked by feelings of mistrust, fear, ambivalence, <br/>\nhatred, and betrayal. These feelings may extend to all family members (Tsai <br/>\nand Wagner, 1978). <br/>\nGuilt is experienced by almost all victims (Tsai and Wagner, 1978). <br/>\nIf a child victim does not resolve the trauma, sexuality may become an area <br/>\nof adult conflict (Courtois & Watts, 1982). <br/>\nAdults who viewed domestic violence in the home as children have a greater <br/>\ndifficulty holding hobs, maintaining relationships with their peers and have <br/>\na higher risk of developing mental health disorders (Patterson, 1992). <br/>\nMen appear to be prone to blame themselves for any sexual abuse they may have <br/>\nexperienced as children (Mendel, 1993.) Abusers:The typical child sex <br/>\noffender molests an average of 117 children, most of who do not report the <br/>\noffence (National Institute of Mental Health, 1988).It is estimated that <br/>\napproximately 71 % of child sex offenders are under 35 and knew the victim at <br/>\nleast causally. About 80 % of these individuals fall within normal <br/>\nintelligence ranges; 59% gain sexual access to their victims through, <br/>\nseduction or enticement (Burgess & Groth, 1984).Stress indicators such as <br/>\nunrealistic expectations of a child, unemployment and low self-esteem are <br/>\nimportant characteristics in perpetrators of child abuse (Health & Human <br/>\nServices, 1993).Approximately 60 % of the male survivors samples report at <br/>\nleast one of their perpetrators to be female (Mendel, 1993).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47588,"nextTopicId":47465}}
