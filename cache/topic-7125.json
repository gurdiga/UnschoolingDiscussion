I didn&#39;t realize that<br/>\nwas what I was already doing.  It&#39;s amazing to me that when I just go with<br/>\nthe flow of things, I always seem to do it right.  (Or at least IMO it&#39;s<br/>\nwhat is right).  I think unschooling is what will work best for our family.<br/>\n It seems to make the most sense.  I bet their are lots of homeschooling<br/>\nfamilies who are unschooling but don&#39;t even know it.  Kind of like<br/>\nattachment parenting, tons of people practice it, but don&#39;t know there&#39;s a<br/>\nname for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also delighted there are so many of you breastfeeding moms and<br/>\nadvocates.  Like Amy, I am also working on my LLL accredidation.  I have<br/>\nbeen nursing my oldest daughter for 4 1/2 years now and my younger daughter<br/>\njust turned 2 and she&#39;s still nursing.  All the stories and advice you gave<br/>\nto Melanie sounded just right.  I would have put in my 2 cents too, but you<br/>\nguys said it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am glad to be on this list, and hope to learn lots more from you<br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nCarli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7124,"nextTopicId":7089}}
