Operating around 180 Khz, the<br/>\ntransmitter simply generates an unmodulated carrier. The smart card<br/>\nreceives<br/>\nthe signal and generates a second very low power reply signal slightly<br/>\noffset from the primary RF carrier.<br/>\n<br/>\nA high sensitivity receiver is monitored manually for what sounds like<br/>\ncomputer hash, the sound of a smart card emission.  Directivity is<br/>\ngood.  Penetration is around 5-8ft.  Anything more would have required a<br/>\n1KW transmitter and would get into EMI/RFR as well as power dissipation<br/>\nissues.  The antenna is very lossy and the power is basically absorbed by<br/>\nthe transmission line in the loop antenna.  Trust me, it gets warm with<br/>\neven 100 watts. But we were testing though walls and steel storage<br/>\ncabinets to see if the signal is getting through.<br/>\n<br/>\nBE built and shipped the box to Schaumburg Friday. It is my understanding<br/>\nJerry Westberg personally drove it from Quincy to the Motorola<br/>\nCampus.  FWIW, it had a BIG apple (Apple computer logo) drawn on the side<br/>\nof the RF deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nA team of engineers worked non-stop until 2AM this morning from Friday to<br/>\nget this thing on a plane to NYC by 7AM EDT.  Most you know Greg Buckwald<br/>\nfrom his AM stereo days.  He&#39;s there heading up the effort. A couple of<br/>\nmy<br/>\nstations contributed parts to the lab side of the research and I was at<br/>\nthe  campus helping test and pack the system before leaving late last<br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey may need some assistance from local broadcast AM and LMR shops in<br/>\nkeeping the gear running.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward contact names and &quot;best chance to find&quot; phone numbers to<br/>\nmy<br/>\naddress off-list.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all realize they have a slim chance of finding someone alive at this<br/>\npoint.  However, if it aids the rescuers in any way towards speeding the<br/>\nlocation of still alive victims or recovery of the departed, it will have<br/>\nserved its purpose and served it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system sent, BTW is the alpha version.  It is pre S/N 000001.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your support and help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael G. McCarthy, CSRE<br/>\nPresident<br/>\nMcCarthy Radio Enterprises, Inc.<br/>\nMt.
