I discussed what interests the child <br/>\npursued and how (my daughter loves to read and joined the teen <br/>\ncouncil at the library, for instance, and included that).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did mention that my older two had written song lyrics, poems, <br/>\nposts on Internet forums about their interests (movies, computer <br/>\nprogramming languages etc.) and estimated how many hours <br/>\nwere spent doing those activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did bring in &quot;samples&quot; if I could find them.

He has covered quite a bit of history and reading this year <br/>\nand has done more than I had ever hoped. Surfing covers a lot of science. <br/>\nBuilding covers math and science and cards and games do also. As for grammar <br/>\ninstant mail and emails apply also. Maybe you could bring in a sample email. They <br/>\ndon&#39;t want every item just a sample or two. Many of the topics covered I did <br/>\nwith photo&#39;s of him at the computer, trampoline, motorcycle, on a ladder helping <br/>\nhis dad build the shed, surfing and playing with his siblings. <br/>\n <br/>\nOur assessment person was awesome she was really open to relaxed fun living. <br/>\nI also brought in his test scores that showed a 1.9 reading level and then <br/>\nhelp up the Halo book he just completed and also some surfing mags and explained <br/>\nthat the mags began his love for reading and then he moved on to novels. I <br/>\nalso printed our entire feedback list and photo&#39;s of items sold on ebay. I also <br/>\nbrought his Paypal card with his name on it. She listened, never criticized and <br/>\nsaid that she was really impressed. My son also gutted a computer and <br/>\nreplaced the CD ROM drive in his.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My dd loves to write letters to people, even builds mailboxes so she <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; can get and give mail.

They sound like they are doing great. Where we <br/>\nlive they don&#39;t turn people down they may suggest some ideas for the following <br/>\nyear but nothing major. You will find also that loads of stuff comes to mind <br/>\nduring and after the assessment. <br/>\nWhen is the assessment?<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":114978651,"authorName":"Darlene Popoalii","from":"&quot;Darlene Popoalii&quot; &lt;popoalii@...&gt;","profile":"home2skool1999","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Meeting state requirements. record keeping?","postDate":"1055699241","msgId":74244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjE1MTc0NzIxLjg1ODkyMjdDNjhAZW1haWwuaXdvbi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":74243,"nextInTopic":74248,"prevInTime":74243,"nextInTime":74245,"topicId":74213,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
