I know from experience (working for social<br/>\nservices) that the conditions in foster homes is not always good,<br/>\nsometime even horrific.  I also know, because I worked with them, that<br/>\nsocial workers are as prone to bias and rashness as anyone else.  They<br/>\ncannot always be depended on to use calm reason in making a decision<br/>\nabout what action to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne doesn&#39;t have to work in the field to know how traumatic being removed<br/>\nfrom the home can be for a child.  I always wonder if I would be causing<br/>\nthem to be taken from one situation to something worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I don&#39;t like spanking I think most children are better off in<br/>\nthis situation than being taken away and put somewhere that could be a<br/>\nmuch worse danger.  Even if the foster home is a good one it&#39;s not worth<br/>\nthe trauma of being taken, not when it comes to spanking.
