It could be years.  He is not in life-threatening<br/>\ncircumstances now, but he has nowhere else to go during long-term<br/>\nrehab than a nursing home in CA, and my brother and sister cannot,<br/>\napparently, live with that option.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s worthwhile to be as open as you can stand to be with your <br/>\nextended family right now.  Tell them that you WON&#39;T rally around and <br/>\nshare the workload.   (Don&#39;t let them make assumptions that they will <br/>\nfind disappointing and hard to live with later.)  You may be doing them <br/>\na favor if you can talk them out of taking direct care of your dad.  <br/>\nEncourage them to look at rehab facilities (locally, at least) so that <br/>\nthe decision that they make is realistic, not based on exaggerated fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n** How do you explain to a young person (ds has just turned 16 and is<br/>\nvery sensitive) that you feel no loyalty to a person who SHOULD have<br/>\nloved you (and who did love you in his own limited way, honestly),<br/>\nbut largely terrorized and abused you instead? **<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to go into the details, you could tell your kids that <br/>\nit is more important to you to put your time and energy into caring for <br/>\nthem, than into caring for your dad.  You could also just say vaguely <br/>\nthat dealing with your father upsets you and takes you days (or weeks or <br/>\nwhatever) to recover from.  Kids younger than teens I would probably <br/>\nprotect from having a relationship with your dad.  But a kid old enough <br/>\nto drive can visit his grandpa at your brother&#39;s house and just leave at <br/>\nany time if the visit becomes unpleasant.  That&#39;s much more power than a <br/>\nyounger kid has.<br/>\n<br/>\n** And to keep this in the general realm of our discussion on democracy<br/>\nin the family -- I really didn&#39;t mean this to become an analysis of<br/>\nmy family problems...I&#39;m sorry -- this is still the overriding<br/>\nquestion: If we are to model for our children lives built on love and<br/>\nloyalty, how do we transcend our own histories of restraint,<br/>\ncoercion, and disconnectivity?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m struggling with this, too.  My dad&#39;s not a bad person, but there are <br/>\nsome issues with abandonment and with unpleasantness associated with <br/>\ndrinking.  Six years I was invited to inconvenience myself a lot to show <br/>\nup and honor my dad and stepmother&#39;s  25th wedding anniversary (the same <br/>\nweekend as my mother&#39;s birthday).  I chose not to go and pretend that we <br/>\nwere an affectionate family.  My dad, who had skipped out on many <br/>\nparenting obligations after divorcing my mom, tried to convince me that <br/>\nsome events were &quot;obligatory&quot;.  I thought this was  hypocritical and <br/>\nwasn&#39;t persuaded.  Bottom line is that I decided, for a few years, to <br/>\nnot treat him any better than I thought he had treated me.  I wasn&#39;t, at <br/>\nthat time, to be able to be a much better person than he had been.  <br/>\nHowever, I did feel guilty about this, and I promised myself that I <br/>\nwould (over time) make a transition to treating him &quot;better than he <br/>\ndeserved&quot;.  He&#39;s over seventy now and I feel compelled to live up to my <br/>\nsecret promise to myself, to treat him better until he dies.  (That just <br/>\nmeans visiting more often and calling.  I don&#39;t live close and I&#39;m not <br/>\nlooking at providing physical care.)  It&#39;s still hard work emotionally <br/>\nfor me to be forgiving.  I did use Daily Affirmation type books designed <br/>\nfor adult children of alchoholics (last year).  And I did grieve and <br/>\nrelive painful feelings and vent angry words to an empty room as part of <br/>\nthe process. (for weeks)  If your issues are bigger than my pretty <br/>\nlittle ones, you might want a counselor to help support you while going <br/>\nthrough a process like this.  (I bent my husband&#39;s ear a lot, and he was <br/>\ngreat at always agreeing with me.)  The best part of the books for me is <br/>\nthat they made it clear that forgiveness is not something that you can <br/>\naccomplish just by snapping your fingers.  That took some of the <br/>\npressure off.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Somehow, it feels disloyal to talk about the old<br/>\nman, but then I realize that keeping these family secrets does<br/>\nnothing but protect the perpetrator. **<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s healing for me to be able to talk about stuff.  The quote &quot;the <br/>\ntruth shall set you free&quot; is biblical, right?  For me to let it go, I <br/>\nhave to talk through the issues and spit it all out through my mouth.  <br/>\n(Even little stuff, like people cutting me off in traffic. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**If I have been consistent in my love for them, or as<br/>\nconsistent as I can be...have loved them as unconditionally as I<br/>\ncan...have respected and honored them as human beings in their own<br/>\nrights (in other words, gifted them in ways I was never gifted by my<br/>\nown father), they will know me for who I am, and will accept my<br/>\nactions at their face value.  Is that about the gist of it? **<br/>\n<br/>\nTangent:<br/>\nThere&#39;s going to come an age when your kids will want to complain about <br/>\nyou.  (Maybe just about something you did by accident.)  It would be a <br/>\ngift to them if you let go of the idea (implanted in your family of <br/>\norigin) that it&#39;s not okay to complain or criticize.   If you can get <br/>\ncomfortable with truthfully criticizing your own parents, and truthfully <br/>\npraising them for whatever you can find that they did right, then maybe <br/>\nit will be easier for you to hear minor critical comments from your own <br/>\nkids.  It&#39;s an attitude shift, but differences of opinion that might <br/>\nhave lead to screaming fights in our own childhoods can be handled <br/>\ncalmly, if we can learn to be truthful and gentle together about <br/>\ndifficult issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that your son will never criticize you, but some day you <br/>\nwill have a daughter-in-law!  Sooooo, getting comfortable with <br/>\ndifferences of opinion and criticism, being able to talk about that <br/>\nstuff rather than feeling that it should be hidden, will certainly come <br/>\nin handy.<br/>\n<br/>\n**and will accept my<br/>\nactions at their face value.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we can understand each other better if we talk about the reasons <br/>\nfor our actions.

My husband&#39;s stepmother, Paula, died a few days ago<br/>\nafter a 15 month battle with lung/brain/bone cancer - which she kept SECRET<br/>\nfrom all of her late husband&#39;s family and associates (my FIL). We only<br/>\ndiscovered her illness in the last 6 weeks, and dh initiated contact - but<br/>\nthat is another story. <br/>\n<br/>\nPaula&#39;s father had died about 3 years ago, also of cancer, after an<br/>\nunpleasantly stressful and acrimonious battle between siblings about his<br/>\nlast wishes - basically her sisters tried to set aside his DNR. Now one of<br/>\nthese same sisters has apparently accused Paula&#39;s last caregivers and her<br/>\nclosest friend, and executor of her will, of murdering her.

I <br/>\nmyself, having been a critical care nurse for years, know I do not <br/>\nwant to suffer indefinitely, and have a notorized Living Will. <br/>\nDespite our differences in desires, we both will honor our individual <br/>\nwishes. We fortunately have discussed these many times, with <br/>\nclarifications as each new consideration has arisen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs most people haven&#39;t the foreknowledge of another&#39;s wishes in this <br/>\nend-of-life situation, generally the medical field assumes <br/>\nthat &quot;everything&quot; must be done. If you feel that you can be objective <br/>\nabout considering what his wishes might have been, such as from <br/>\ndiscussions or comments about others in similar situations, <br/>\ncommunicate his probable wishes to his medical team. If you feel that <br/>\nyou can not be objective due to your own issues with him, remove <br/>\nyourself from the decision making process. My father and I are more <br/>\nthan estranged, in no way could I be objective in these decisions <br/>\nunless his wishes were in writing; therefore, I would not participate <br/>\nin the process. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as modeling for your family, if you have not been true to <br/>\nyourself about your relationship with your father than you could not <br/>\nhave been true to them either. I realized that I was falsely <br/>\nrepresenting my father as a trusted member of our family to our son, <br/>\nwhen this was not true.

(sexual <br/>\nabuse)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the decision is related to his extended personal care, such as in <br/>\nyour home. The above holds true. If you haven&#39;t been honest about the <br/>\nrelationship with yourself, it is difficult to have been honest with <br/>\nyour family. My father and I superficially had a relationship, <br/>\nbut &quot;made nice&quot; whenever we were together. This won&#39;t work 24/7. <br/>\nDepending on the age of your family members, each can understand <br/>\nvarious elements of your truth. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, my husband was emotionally and financially devoted to <br/>\nhis mother, but she still didn&#39;t live with us her last years of life. <br/>\nWe did everything we personally decided was best for our immediate <br/>\nfamily but having her live with us would not have been a healthy <br/>\nsituation, in our opinion.

All the <br/>\nkids saw her twice before she died, and Holly and I saw her several times, <br/>\ngoing nearly every day to take care of her at her apartment, deliver/pick up <br/>\nlaundry, do her dishes, change her bed, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; It is how I act here that my children take clues as to how to act with me <br/>\nwhen my time comes, down the road, is it not?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids know many stories of how my mom was with me, and they have their own <br/>\nexperiences with her, too.    If their feelings about me are as mixed as mine <br/>\nwere about my mom, that will be about the way I treated them, not about the <br/>\nway I treated my mom.   When my mom was dying, I thought very little about her <br/>\nrelationship with her own mom.    Though my mom travelled 600 miles to attend <br/>\nmy granny&#39;s funeral, she got drunk and decided not to go, instead, once she was <br/>\nat the house.   That did comfort me when I decided not to be there when my <br/>\nmom&#39;s ashes were scattered.  I did take care of the cremation and get the ashes <br/>\nto my sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did and thought, Laura, in those last days was that I needed to do <br/>\nenough to keep me from regretting my actions for the rest of my life.  I <br/>\naccomplished that.  It wasn&#39;t easy, and her best friend who was supposed to be helping <br/>\nwasn&#39;t as much help as she offered to be.  My mom had lied different lies to <br/>\nboth of us, though, and tried to set us against one another (inexplicable, <br/>\nirrational, typical).  So for my sake and Holly&#39;s, I helped her a lot the last <br/>\nfew weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":178121365,"authorName":"Laura Bourdo","from":"&quot;Laura Bourdo&quot; &lt;LauraBourdo@...&gt;","profile":"crazeemom77043","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Let&#39;s bring this down to the practical from the theoretical...(Was: a whole new way of interacting)","postDate":"1091398181","msgId":97168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWM0NzgxNCQzZWY4ZmE4MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBob3VzdG9uLnJyLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwOTEzNTY0MDcuODM5LjIwNDU0Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":97170,"prevInTime":97167,"nextInTime":97169,"topicId":97168,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Interdependence and consensual living are both processes of interacting","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1062537315\">&lt;&lt;Date: Sat, 31 Jul 2004 15:12:35 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;eriksmama2001&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scubamama@...\">scubamama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nInterdependence and consensual living are both processes of<br/>\ninteracting with others, innate processes.
