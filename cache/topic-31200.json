(I&#39;m <br/>\nsure you all are familiar with these books, but to jog your memory if <br/>\nnot, they are the books focusing on certain girls during different <br/>\nperiods of American history.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough our discussions of these books, we will be generating <br/>\nquestions and activities that may be good for homeschooling (or <br/>\nunschooling) parents and homeschooled (or unschooled) children who <br/>\nare working with these books. (BooksAboutGirls is family-friendly, so <br/>\nchildren and adolescents can <br/>\nsubscribe safely.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a detailed Reading Schedule posted in the &quot;Files&quot; section of <br/>\nthe BooksAboutGirls site (which is at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BooksAboutGirls/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BooksAboutGirls/</a> ), but here is a <br/>\nshortened version of the schedule, showing the dates, the American <br/>\nGirl, and the historical period corresponding to that fictional <br/>\nfigure.
