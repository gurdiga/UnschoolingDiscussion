I think some people (including <br/>\nme when I fall into this mode of thinking) expect that unschooling will <br/>\ncure all the ills of humanity. On another list I&#39;m on, there was some <br/>\ndiscussion about a family who homeschooled, respected their kids, and <br/>\nstill had serious problems. It was presented as if it were a problem <br/>\nwith homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I get into this mode of thinking, I ask myself what people were <br/>\nlike before schooling became widespread. The answer is that many people <br/>\nwere good, generous, hardworking and upstanding. But there have always <br/>\nbeen people in every age that were shiftless, lazy, irresponsible, <br/>\ndrunk, selfish people. It&#39;s not only about schooling. I think schooling <br/>\nand the attitudes that go with it make these things worse. And I think <br/>\nunschooling and the attitudes that go with it decrease the probabilities <br/>\nof that, but I also think it&#39;s not a panacea for all the ills of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis message is a result of my own thoughts and is not a response to any <br/>\nprevious post or any specific poster.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78614,"nextTopicId":78621}}
