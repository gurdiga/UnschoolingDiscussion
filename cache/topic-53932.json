Couldn&#39;t stand the sight <br/>\nof a rake or a pine cone! I made the decision THEN that I wouldn&#39;t require MY <br/>\nchildren to do yard work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Cameron left school, there was certainly more time for him to &quot;do&quot; <br/>\nthings in the yard: building and painting a fence, planning/planting a <br/>\ngarden, handweeding, raking, mowing, etc. Ben thought I should make him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d ask for help. He&#39;s say, &quot;Do I HAVE to?&quot; I&#39;d cheerfully say, &quot;Nope.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nA few months passed. One day he asked why I didn&#39;t MAKE him do things. All <br/>\nhis friends&#39; parents made them do yardwork. I said that I only wanted him to <br/>\nhelp if he WANTED to help. Being MADE to do yardwork would only make him hate <br/>\nit. Doing it because he liked having a beautiful yard or to relieve me of <br/>\nsome of the labor or for physical release or pleasure---those would be good <br/>\nreasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do things for him all the time that I wouldn&#39;t chose to do for others <br/>\nbecause I love him and I want to do for him. When he was ready, I&#39;d love for <br/>\nhim to join me. But not until then.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months after that, I was in the garden picking up pine cones. He joined <br/>\nme. The next time he helped rake (took HALF the time it would have if only <br/>\none of us had been working alone). &gt;We get a lot of talking in then too.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, if he sees me in the yard (or if I say that I&#39;ll be in the yard <br/>\nworking), he&#39;ll come out and help. He almost always does dishes that don&#39;t <br/>\nget done the night before (especially if I&#39;m gone in the morning). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s understanding that we ALL have the right to say no. The last <br/>\nweeks before the conference last fall, I was a basket case and ignored the <br/>\nhouse and yard. Both boys and my husband pitched in to a degree they don&#39;t <br/>\nusually. They saw that I NEEDED help. We&#39;re a team, partners. But to us that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that we all MUST do certain things; it means we do things we <br/>\nmight not like to do because we want to. It makes a loved one&#39;s life easier <br/>\nor sweeter or cleaner or more beautiful. Because we WANT to.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Because I said so&quot; is a crappy reason to do ANYthing!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128307542,"authorName":"Earthmomma67@aol.com","from":"Earthmomma67@...","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: More on family life","postDate":"1042115073","msgId":53970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MC43NTAyOTJkLjJiNGVjNDAxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53932,"nextInTopic":53976,"prevInTime":53969,"nextInTime":53971,"topicId":53932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/8/03 10:50:42 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
