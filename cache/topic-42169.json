It&#39;s over a dozen questions now, I&#39;m sure, that people have asked <br/>\nNed directly that he has just flatly ignored.  If he&#39;s going to pour <br/>\nvitriolic rhetoric over us all with NO attempt at responsibility for the <br/>\n&quot;facts&quot; he&#39;s presenting, I think it is vastly more damaging than it&#39;s worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might not get my way if I ask, and that&#39;s fine.
