Not that I think I restricted them before but <br/>\nyes I gently tried to persuade and isn&#39; that the same thing? I remember a <br/>\nfew of you here that said they were still trying to get the hang of it all. <br/>\nSo just a little story.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 year old the other day was asking for pudding. She really hadn&#39;t had <br/>\nmuch of substantial eating all day. I was leary and trying to suggest a few <br/>\nother things. It had seemed like she would go to bed with snacks all day and <br/>\nthat isn&#39;t like her so I wondered. When my husband asked why the baby was <br/>\nupset, I said because she wants pudding and I want her to eat. So being my <br/>\nbetter half when I&#39;m not, he said, &quot;Isn&#39;t pudding eating?&quot; Next minute she <br/>\nwas happily sitting on the kitchen counter eating pudding. After she <br/>\nfinished, she asked for meatball and ravioli&#39;s which she ate a generous <br/>\nplate of. Proved a point to me!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot 2 nights later, my 7 year old son was as usual putting everyone to bed <br/>\nbefore him. I stay up as long as he needs to. He was happily doing his own <br/>\nthing and I was watching mindless TV when he came into the living room and <br/>\ntold me that his body was telling him he was tired. It was 1:00 a.m. and he <br/>\nwas finally ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all does work. Patience on our part is the hardest thing. The kids breeze <br/>\nright through it!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48455,"nextTopicId":48621}}
