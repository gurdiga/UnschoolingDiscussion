When Holt Associates decided they <br/>\nneeded more time to focus on publishing Growing Without Schooling <br/>\nmagazine, speaking at conferences, providing homeschooling <br/>\nconsultations, and publishing books, they decided to look for an <br/>\nalternative to closing their twenty-year-old John Holt&#39;s<br/>\nBookstore. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are pleased to announce that the John Holt&#39;s Bookstore<br/>\noperations have been sold to FUN Books effective Aug 1, 2001.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis arrangement is a natural fit for both our companies as over the <br/>\nyears we have developed an excellent relationship and found that we <br/>\nshare a similar philosophy. You can now look to FUN Books for the <br/>\nbest selections from the John Holt&#39;s Bookstore, as well as the<br/>\nmany other titles we have available. The staff at Holt Associates <br/>\nwill continue to provide reviews and book recommendations that FUN <br/>\nBooks will use to make sure we have the &quot;latest and greatest&quot;<br/>\nbooks available for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you recently placed an order with John Holt&#39;s Bookstore, your <br/>\norder will now be filled by FUN Books and may already be on its way <br/>\nto you!
