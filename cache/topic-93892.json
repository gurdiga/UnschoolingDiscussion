I have several who love to play <br/>\nsports (three during the spring), one who takes art lessons, two who <br/>\nare in drama, another who has a cookie business and we&#39;re a part of a <br/>\nco-op.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to keep a family calendar and we juggle the finances by expecting <br/>\nmore contributions toward their interests by the older ones who can <br/>\nearn and less from the younger ones. We try to keep sports to one per <br/>\nchild per year, but that isn&#39;t totally working now that we have a <br/>\ncouple who are really into what they play. So we keep juggling.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the weeks at home, the older two pretty much follow their <br/>\ninterests on their own, with dialog and support. The younger three <br/>\nspend the days with me and we do stuff together - reading aloud, <br/>\ndrawing, hiking, playing games, watching movies, cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest adjustment for me has been to realize that I don&#39;t have to <br/>\n&quot;make&quot; anything happen. I just need to be available. As interests <br/>\ndevelop, I support as far as I can. One of our kids loves astronomy and <br/>\nhas wanted to go to Space Camp for the last two years. My husband <br/>\nhelped him start a cookie business and this kid (now 12) has earned <br/>\nover $700 selling cookies in our neighborhood to pay for camp. When we <br/>\nwere cash poor and my two older kids wanted to do Vintage Dance <br/>\nlessons, we offered to post flyers every week in different <br/>\nneighborhoods and they waived the fees.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have several computers (keep collecting more), we have X Box, we <br/>\nhave DVR and two TVs. I recommend multiple everything so that there <br/>\naren&#39;t unnecessary conflicts over who gets to watch, play what and <br/>\nwhen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve learned that with five kids, motivation must come from within <br/>\nthem. We support them as far as we can, but they are the ones to <br/>\npractice or follow an interest. I&#39;m an avid bird watcher and have a son <br/>\nwho enjoys it too. I just do what I do with birds. He&#39;s welcome to <br/>\nparticipate or not. He does. The others only show mild interest, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nRambliing, but hope that helps a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and multiple children","postDate":"1084370755","msgId":93908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3dGIwMytvMHFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM0MzgyOSQyZTgzZjEzMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBORVNUTU9NPg=="},"prevInTopic":93907,"nextInTopic":93924,"prevInTime":93907,"nextInTime":93909,"topicId":93892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... but the main thing is that ...

One of the things that kept me a relaxed/eclectic homeschooler <br/>\nfor a while was that I had so many children, and I thought that as a <br/>\nunschooler, I just naturally wouldn&#39;t give each child enough attention.  Well, I was <br/>\ndefinitely wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is so much easier to give each child what they need at the moment.  My <br/>\nchildren do what they want when they want...while still respecting the others <br/>\nthey live with (their siblings and me.)  Sometimes this means that I&#39;m not <br/>\navailable for help right away because I&#39;m helping someone else.  That&#39;s OK.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s just part of being a big family. (I&#39;m a single parent too, so I don&#39;t have <br/>\na *helper*.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily, most of my children are able to explore their interests on their <br/>\nown.  They are very independent.  But I have become very adept at multitasking <br/>\ntoo!  Lately Lia (who cannot read very much yet) has taken an interest in <br/>\nwriting.  I&#39;ve developed the ability to spell words while doing pretty much anything <br/>\nelse at the same time.  All my kids like to join me in the kitchen, and the <br/>\nolder ones enjoy spending time with the younger ones most of the time.  We all <br/>\nhave our own strengths and weaknesses so I think that we really all help each <br/>\nother.  For example, right now, Emily is helping me explore my interests in <br/>\ngraphic design and dancing.  JoAnn often does the spelling for Lia.  Antonio <br/>\n(the resident computer expert) helps all of us!<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently asked each of my kids, during a rare alone with me moment,  how <br/>\nthey felt about the *radical unschooling* (I&#39;ve only extended the philosophy to <br/>\nbedtimes, food, and chores since about Oct. 2003.)  They were all so happy and <br/>\nhad no reservations.  Matter of fact, I&#39;ve noticed a few of them have started <br/>\nreferring to school as *juvenile jail*.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":165113240,"authorName":"dinalauzon","from":"&quot;dinalauzon&quot; &lt;dlauzon32@...&gt;","profile":"dinalauzon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling and multiple children","postDate":"1084335232","msgId":93892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3czhhMCtsNnBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93900,"prevInTime":93891,"nextInTime":93893,"topicId":93892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would like to hear from those of you who employ (or have employed) the unschooling philosophy with a large family.
