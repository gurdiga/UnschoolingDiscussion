I guess I thought if some kids felt they <br/>\nneeded to get prepared for college in computers, they may be <br/>\ndoing math but by their own initiative. Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books <br/>\npoint that out and she recommends Saxon, of all things (which <br/>\nmy kids hate). But I figured some of you may have done it in <br/>\ncreative ways hence my question.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Did you take four years of math before you went to college? <br/>\nNew Mexico <br/>\nrequires two. I took ONE. I got a degree at 21.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI took two and a half years at which point my teacher told me to <br/>\nquit so I wouldn&#39;t ruin my GPA (which was really high, but I was <br/>\nmiserable in math). I was aimed at theater arts, however, not <br/>\ntechnology. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Is there someone there who could dash cold water on you <br/>\nmaybe?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL Okay, I&#39;ll go take a cold shower.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just need to know that I can come here for suggestions and <br/>\nreminders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do appreciate the help everyone&#39;s offered.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B (splashes cold water on face and watches it freeze in the <br/>\nbelow twenty weather)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56725,"nextTopicId":56792}}
