I do,  however,  believe nurture has an<br/>\neffect.  Even perhaps that the nurture part (over which parents have a<br/>\nstrong influence) needs to accomodate for the nature of the person.  I have<br/>\nthe &#39;messy gene&#39; as does my hubby.  During her toddlerhood,  my now 6 yr old<br/>\nseemed born organized....maybe we influenced it out of her,  but she&#39;s<br/>\ntotally a messy one now! LOL<br/>\n    I am a Flybaby, too.  Since August 2001.  I worked the program...down to<br/>\nthe shoes...through October.  I felt like Wonder Woman!  The diffeerence in<br/>\nour house was not the only noticable difference.  My parental stress level<br/>\nwas diminished immensely.  The time we saved looking for shoes, socks,<br/>\nhairbrushes,  clothes was totally amazing.  No more yelling mom when we had<br/>\nto go somewhere.   In true SHE fashion,  I began to take on too many other<br/>\nresponsibilities including  handmaking five Halloween costumes.  Mind you,<br/>\nI not only didn&#39;t own a sewing machine before this,  but completely learned<br/>\nsewing on my own!  And the old machine I bpought needed to be taken out and<br/>\ntuned up!  I hosted a great first birthday party for my son&#39;s halloween<br/>\nbirthday,  and had several out-of town guests for the weekend of his party.<br/>\nIt was as if Martha Stewart herself had possesed my being!   I baked and<br/>\ndecorated the cakes and catered the weekend.  On top of that - my three yr<br/>\nold,  caught up in the excitement of a visit from her out of town cousins,<br/>\ncrashed into a corner and split her head wide open.  This crisis was handled<br/>\nquite smoothly.  Flylady&#39;s program had gotten me so far that it was NO<br/>\nproblem to save my bllod stained shirt...I had a clean one right there ready<br/>\nto go (This is quite a major coup for one such as I!!)  The weekend went so<br/>\nsmoothly!  And halloween was a Wednesday.  I invited all the neighborhood<br/>\nkidlets to my house 1/2 hour before trick or treat to have home baked<br/>\ncookies and sing to my son.   I got through all this well.  BUT,  by mid Nov<br/>\nember,  I had worn out my shoes from wearing them every day  and couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfind a pair to fit my wide feet.  I quit the shoes....and things have<br/>\nunraveled a bit from there,  my son stopped sleeping through the night,  I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t darg myself out of bed for the routines.  I fell back to Fly baby<br/>\n(thought I had reached fly toddlerhood).  And have remained at the beginning<br/>\npoint since.  I&#39;ve still progressed a lot.  But it&#39;s a struggle now.<br/>\n    What I&#39;ve noticed in my life is that while I&#39;m quite capable of<br/>\norganizing thoughts and ideas,  I have not experienced the ability to manage<br/>\nthe &quot;basics&quot; of maintaining an organizational system.  I can GET things<br/>\norganized,  but not maintain them.  BUT,  I function better in an organized<br/>\nenvironment.  I think it may be why some people think they need school - it<br/>\nprovides a routine and structure within which they can function.<br/>\n    For me,  I want to provide the type of environment which will enable my<br/>\nchildren to thrive (FLY?).  Flylady has helped decrease our stress and<br/>\nincrease the fun in our household.<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mimi;<br/>\n&gt; I&quot;ve been &#39;flying&#39; for almost a year now and trust me I am STILL a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>flybaby!!

BUT what happened? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What happened is that he was taught that WOMEN cleaned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up these messes, not men.  My husband (Korean) was brought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up the very same way as your husband.  In his home, men never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lifted a finger.  From the moment they walked through the door, to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the moment they left the house, the women waited on them hand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and foot.  Food was brought to them, and dirty dishes were taken<br/>\n&gt; &gt; away and washed.  They would dump dirty clothes on the floor and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the clothes were scooped up by the women, washed, folded and put<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back into drawers.  When hubby needed new underwear, his Mom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ran out and bought them for him (this was when he was 25!!).  At<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dinner, if his drink was almost finished, she would jump up to refill<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it for him before it was empty.  Same with his rice bowl.  His mother<br/>\n&gt; &gt; always cut up the meat for her husband so he wouldn&#39;t have to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bothered cutting his own meat.  She also took the bones out of fish<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for him, again, so he could eat without having to work at it.  The men<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did NOTHING *in* the house!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It has taken YEARS for me to get my husband to help around the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house.  When we were living with his parents, they would literally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scold him whenever he tried to help me out accusing me of being<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a very lazy wife for not doing EVERYTHING for him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; One time, they literally jumped down my throat because I refused<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to peel oranges for him, section them and present them to him on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a plate.  I figured, he&#39;s a grown man, he can peel his own oranges!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nope, we&#39;ve had whole boxes of mandarin oranges go bad because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he refused to peel them himself.  So, I&#39;ve just quit buying oranges.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I could go on and on,,,but I&#39;m sure you get the picture.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Andrea Kim :-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mommy to two sweeties!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Laura (almost 6!!) and Allison (2)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Kent, WA,,,,soon to be Seattle!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!

And Jellybeans with malt sugar or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fruit juice.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jellos and puddings are also available.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; And there&#39;s a great line of honey sweetened cereals available now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On *rare* occasion when we&#39;re away or out and about, my son wants<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;bubble<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; gum&#39;, since the Peelu is minty and he thinks is too spicy. So then, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only then, we buy Bazooka. Yes, Bazooka. It has refinded sugar BUT it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have a lot of the other crap that a lot of gums have. And it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have aspartme (sp) which is deadlier than refinded sugar.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Keeping these treats in my purse, or in a goodie backpack that we drag<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; around, is a great way to keep outside influences from making my son<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; slighted.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; TV advertisements does make it hard on me.

If<br/>\n&gt; there is evidence otherwise, I would welcome it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If one doesn&#39;t have an insulin problem, then the choice would be to go<br/>\n&gt; towards the natural way, not the processed way. An insulin problem person<br/>\n&gt; must limit more than just sugar.

My niece is not. (she&#39;s just a few years<br/>\n&gt; younger than I and has more children)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The organic families have choices for the kids, no limits. They will<br/>\n&gt; invariably ask for something to &#39;eat&#39; when they are hungry. As opposed to<br/>\n&gt; just go into the cabinet for a nosh when wanting *something*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The processed food families seem to have to limit their children, cajole<br/>\n&gt; them to &#39;eat&#39; food and oversee their intake on their choices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Establishing that none of the children spoken of have an insulin problem<br/>\n&gt; (as of yet).
