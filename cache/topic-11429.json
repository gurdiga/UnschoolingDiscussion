It is<br/>\n&gt; allowing them choices to decide HOW they want to learn be it games, reading,<br/>\n&gt; internet, hand on, tv, and most important just playing and living...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, according to what you&#39;ve just said here, I think you have the idea<br/>\nquite nicely.  Unschooling is about what children want to learn, when they<br/>\nwant to learn it.
