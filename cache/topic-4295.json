Did<br/>\ntheir interest lead them to ask you to set up a field trip with the support<br/>\ngroup? I&#39;m serious.  Remember leading isn&#39;t just about choosing the topic<br/>\nand having someone else direct activities within the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to confuse matters, it can sometimes work that way.   My kids have said<br/>\nwhat about _____ and I&#39;ve said well, we can do _____and ____ or _____.  Then<br/>\nwe go from there. But I never expect just because we have set something up<br/>\nthat they,are even I, will love it.  The mix of people there, the weather,<br/>\nwhat we ate, who fought with whom and how close to the trip,  ALL of these<br/>\nthings have an effect.  If we get somewhere and it&#39;s boring or not what we<br/>\nexpected we make the best of it can escape as soon as we are able.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here&#39;s another kicker, being interested in something does not mean we<br/>\nalways want to dive into the topic and learn tons about it.  Even kids have<br/>\nsurface interests, something will pique their curosity, after some<br/>\nreflection/thinking time it&#39;s time to move on, until life brings that topic<br/>\nup again itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t predict and plan too much learning when you respect the cycles of<br/>\nthe children. You can only be there to answer questions, give your opinion<br/>\nand help when requested. It can feel very chaotic.  Unless you are blessed<br/>\nwith a child who loves to plan and carry out plans!

Re: the children doing nothing more<br/>\nthan eating the cheese with crackers and you feel the whole experience<br/>\nwas not a learning one.  I guess that is one of the areas I feel<br/>\ndifferentiates UNschooling--why do you feel a need to determine what<br/>\nconstitutes a &quot;learning experience&quot; for _them_, why are you not enjoying<br/>\nthe cheese and crackers with them and enjoying the chance to observe<br/>\nyour own children at a peaceful moment, doing something pleasant,<br/>\ninvolved with your own learning experience?  Learning will come and you<br/>\nwill see it, but not when you are trying to be in control, or directing,<br/>\nit, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in your spot twenty-some years ago.  I took my older two children<br/>\nout of school and then was rather puzzled when they were not ecstatic to<br/>\ndo all these wonderful things _I_ put together for them.  I never sent<br/>\nthe two younger ones.  All four were extremely good at balking when I<br/>\ntried to determine their lives.  I like to say we evolved into<br/>\nunschooling, with plenty of bumps along the way.  Well, they are all<br/>\ngrown and parents in their own right now.  One of my sons has not<br/>\ndecided if he will homeschool or not--his babies are two and 6 months.<br/>\nThe others are in active homeschooling families.  Thank goodness for<br/>\nJohn Holt and GWS and their constant assurance that children really can<br/>\nand do learn what is important to them.  I needed it.  However, over the<br/>\nyears, as I learned to observe my children and learn from them, it all<br/>\ncame right.  You are really not far at all from the point where they<br/>\nwill constantly &quot;wow&quot; you with the depths of information they will gain<br/>\nin pursuit of a subject of their own desire.  Hang in there and when you<br/>\nfeel stressed, RELAX and watch your children.  They will lead you to<br/>\nunschooling, if you will let them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never had much patience with bickering--still don&#39;t.  Over the years,<br/>\nI tried many creative approaches to managing it, like &quot;Take it into<br/>\nanother room where I can&#39;t hear you.  If I hear you, I will think you<br/>\nare just bored and I will think of something for you to do.  Trust me,<br/>\nyou will not like what I think of near as well as something you think of<br/>\nyourself&quot;.  That was somewhat successful because we lived in a very<br/>\nsmall house at the time, thin walls, and it is hard to argue in<br/>\nwhispers!  Another reasonably good one was, &quot;this problem is between the<br/>\ntwo of you and you will have to solve it, through discussion, on your<br/>\nown.  Negotiate til you reach an agreement you are both satisfied with<br/>\nand let me know when you&#39;re finished.  An agreement to disagree, respect<br/>\none another&#39;s separate views and right to do so, and to avoid each other<br/>\nis perfectly acceptable&quot;.  This last one works really well with my<br/>\ngrandchildren, who are a part of my day-to-day life, even the little<br/>\nbitties.  They have to sit together on the love seat, discuss their<br/>\nproblem, reach a solution, and let me know it is solved, before they can<br/>\nrejoin the play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so now, after putting in my much more than two cents&#39; worth, I have<br/>\nto tell you that I will be going no-mail for two weeks while I go visit<br/>\nmy sister in Texas (I am in Oklahoma).  This was not intentional to<br/>\nprevent flack from this post; it has been planned for some time!  I look<br/>\nforward to joining you again, hearing your thoughts, and telling you<br/>\nmuch, much more than you probably ever would want to know about my kids<br/>\nand grandkids, all of whom are really simply incredible!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandi Myers</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carolyn Talarr","from":"&quot;Carolyn Talarr&quot; &lt;talarr@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"sp-1B0IytRBYI-U09U4AhWMs6kxhSzJBK1VZuxm7GhTbxXgkLgerllKKy13g02i0IQw4RIVU2ISbp4GNAX7K5k956wha3tse2lefzM6sfg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling/unjobbing?","postDate":"942065294","msgId":4326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yODcuNDMyNi45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4325,"nextInTopic":4340,"prevInTime":4325,"nextInTime":4327,"topicId":4295,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I just have to say that as a former kid I really admire their conspiratorial abilities! :) ... own.LOL ... ride ...

My thought however is you<br/>\nmust never have had kids in ps.  Perhaps I&#39;m wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving had my oldest dd in ps for 4 years has devastated her desire to<br/>\nlearn.  It took from July of &#39;98 until March of &#39;99 to see her pick<br/>\nanything to do on her own.  ANYTHING!  Ooops, one exception - she did graph<br/>\nher Halloween candy last year.  (And from what I&#39;ve heard I have had great<br/>\nsuccess with her moving toward unschooling - something like I could have<br/>\ngone 4 years or more before seeing this.  Yikes! ) Now part of this was my<br/>\nown problem with letting go and relaxing.  I, as I&#39;m sure you do too, look<br/>\nat my children&#39;s education as being extremely important.  My state&#39;s laws<br/>\nhave basic requirements that I feel I must be sure are met in order to be<br/>\nhonest with them about our efforts at hsing.  It is my belief that one day<br/>\nmy dd will be entirely leading her own education but I don&#39;t see it any<br/>\ntime soon.  Maybe two years or so from now.  I hope and pray.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned, the Prairie Primer provides us with a springboard for when<br/>\nthey don&#39;t know what to do.  (Now, I do see that my 6 yog would unschool in<br/>\nan instant without a hitch - she only went to preschool - where I worked -<br/>\nyet she is stifled somewhat by the transition with the older dd.)  I have a<br/>\nreal problem with them sitting around doing nothing but watching TV,<br/>\ntickling each other and doing crosstitch - although all can have great<br/>\neducational benefits if chosen wisely (TV chosen wisely.)  If and when they<br/>\nchoose to do something that can build their language arts or math skills -<br/>\nI&#39;m a happy camper and do my own thing.  Or if they read about history or<br/>\ndo science projects.  But when they get to the point of as I put it<br/>\n&quot;goofing off&quot; then I feel the need to direct them a little.  To me that<br/>\nmeans giving them choices of things I find acceptable/educational.  I know,<br/>\nI know, everything is educational - but time is short and I do have a<br/>\nresponsibility to see that they don&#39;t waste theirs.  Besides, they ask to<br/>\ndo the Little House books and activities as a matter of fact I have trouble<br/>\nkeeping up with them!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy desire would be that at say a high school level, my dds would be able to<br/>\nchoose what they study but that they would be diligent in pursuing these<br/>\ninterests, not just flitting about from one more or less useless subject to<br/>\nanother (somehow I know I&#39;m going to catch it for this post :o).  And that<br/>\nby then they would be wise enough to realize there may be things out there<br/>\nthey NEED to pursue whether they WANT to or not to achieve their personal<br/>\ngoals.  And that they do it themselves without compulsion.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the unit study is my crutch, my safety net and hers too as she was<br/>\ntaught what, how and when to learn anything in ps.  I find it appalling.  I<br/>\nhate it!  But I feel it necessary in the transition of ps to unschooling.<br/>\nI tried deschooling off and on for several months last year only to find it<br/>\ndrove both she and I crazy.  So I sought something that could be a<br/>\nspringboard so we could sleep at night.  We&#39;ve even gone back to &quot;doing&quot;<br/>\nmath several times a week - in several different ways not just text books<br/>\nas I was totally uncomfortable with her not touching math at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t utilize everything in the unit study, we pick and choose according<br/>\nto our interests (OK sometimes I see something I believe they REALLY need<br/>\nto know, like &quot;manners&quot;, and push a little :o)  but, I&#39;m much better at<br/>\nletting it go when I see there is no real interest in a subject.  The<br/>\nPrimer also may just say - &quot;study the moon.&quot;  Not how to study it or<br/>\nexactly what to do with every activity (some do but relatively few - we<br/>\ndon&#39;t usually choose to do the more directed ones anyway.) So we can delve<br/>\nin any way we want.  For example, this week we are going to the woods to<br/>\nlook at fungi in the woods, perhaps draw a few if they are into it.  The<br/>\nPrimer just said - study about fungi and lichens.  I got a library book to<br/>\nwhich they groaned and today we were in the woods cutting firewood and they<br/>\nwere fascinated with two samples of fungi they found.  So it is not the<br/>\ntopic they object to it is the method - don&#39;t just sit us down with a book<br/>\nMom!  But I do have a subtile hope that going out and looking around may<br/>\nspike their interest enough to at least make the book worth looking through.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is providing me with a gentle adjustment from my schooling experiences<br/>\nas well.  I hope it is also giving her a gentle adjustment as cold turkey<br/>\njust wasn&#39;t working for either of us.  I don&#39;t believe a child that is<br/>\nworried they are not learning what all their ex-school friends are will be<br/>\nfree enough to learn on their own - my daughter fell into this box.  She<br/>\nstill compares what she is learning with what her best friend in ps is<br/>\ndoing.  About a month ago it set her off and she sought out how to read the<br/>\nlatitude and longitude markings on maps and globes - on her own!  She<br/>\nsought out a workbook on geography to accomplish it but she did it!  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make her - she wanted to.  To me that was thrilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I see her adjustment level (cross stitch, read, and watch TV) as<br/>\nstill a little unacceptable.  I&#39;m THRILLED she is now reading because she<br/>\nloves it and feel so thankful for that.  But cross stitch is a pass time<br/>\nand TV - well, don&#39;t get me started on that subject - I married a man that<br/>\nstudied cinematography (sp?) and his TV addiction drives me nuts - the kids<br/>\ncome by it honestly.  Aren&#39;t pass times just for that - passing the time?<br/>\nTo me simply watching time pass is not useful.  I&#39;m not talking about time<br/>\nto digest what they have been learning here I&#39;m talking about it being the<br/>\nmain subject on their menus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a part of a support group that has a lot of unschoolers in it.  And<br/>\nwhat I have seen is those that actually unschool (versus eclectic approach)<br/>\nhave all unschooled from day one and had learned a lot about unschooling<br/>\nfor years before they had to notify the schools of their intent to hs.<br/>\nThey had time to think it all through and become convinced.  I on the other<br/>\nhand had considered hsing before my dd went to ps but had never heard of<br/>\nany other method than school-at-home Calvert style.  I learned about<br/>\nunschooling 2 months before we started hsing.  It is taking a lot more time<br/>\nthan 2 months to change the thought patterns and habit patterns.  Visiting<br/>\nwith teens that have unschooled their entire lives has been the main thing<br/>\nthat keeps me wanting to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this makes sense to a hard core unschooler or not but I<br/>\nreally think it is a different situation to pull them out than it is to<br/>\nkeep them home from the start and KNOW you want to unschool to begin with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you to understand why I would even entertain the thought<br/>\nof a unit study approach even on a limited basis.  Now, I&#39;m all ears -<br/>\nconvince me to go back to cold turkey.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReady to learn.<br/>\nLaraine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonknit@xxx.xxx","from":"Bonknit@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"NB8VYAExtrzk75iFxZ7Sz4McEbJSEB52Tj-p9w1_5SMs4ZWjrFO6mxfJL2jV9MIL6c0VsPKw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling/unjobbing?","postDate":"942015711","msgId":4301,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yODUuNDMwMS45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4300,"nextInTopic":4304,"prevInTime":4300,"nextInTime":4302,"topicId":4295,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/7/99 3:46:58 PM Eastern Standard Time, jhawthorne@home.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1529854664\">In a message dated 11/7/99 3:46:58 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawthorne@...\">jhawthorne@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The love of learning is diminished by the efforts of people to<br/>\n force people to learn.

I have had<br/>\nsquirmy feelings about unit studies. In some ways they are better than some<br/>\nother types of &#39;school&#39; work but they always feel somewhat contrived to me.<br/>\nWhen we read the &#39;Little House&#39; books we managed to come up with enough<br/>\nquestions to keep us going interminably! The questions were ours, not<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s. The follow up activities (if you want to talk in schooly<br/>\nterms) were what interested us, not someone else. It became relevant to us.<br/>\nNot all books produce in depth questions and &#39;extention activities&#39; and<br/>\nthat&#39;s okay too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome books or activities take us in directions that other people may never<br/>\nthink of. Some small thing triggers a line of thought and exploration that<br/>\nmay be only faintly related to the original experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, recently we visited a Gouda cheese making factory. This could<br/>\nhave triggered an interest in various aspects of cheese, but as the owners<br/>\nwere originally from Holland, it might have triggered an interest in that<br/>\ncountry, or in why people emigrate from their home countries, or, or, or....<br/>\nBut the interest generated would have been relevant to us. A school class<br/>\nvisiting would have had a preset agenda. So would a family doing a unit<br/>\nstudy. And how would those parents / teachers have coped with the outcome we<br/>\nexperienced - although my kids found the visit interesting, the only<br/>\nfollow-up activity they were interested in was buying some Gouda cheese and<br/>\npigging out on cheese and crackers!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that fine with me - I don&#39;t expect either me or my kids to want to<br/>\nfollow up on everything. Nor do I expect us all to find the same things<br/>\nfascinating.

Inuit have 8  (or maybe 2 dozen) words for<br/>\nsnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are brainwashed about schooling.  Learning is a natural bred in the<br/>\nbone affair.  We are learning creatures.  What we decide to learn is<br/>\ndetermined by our environments, our nurturing and our individual<br/>\nnatures.  The love of learning is diminished by the efforts of people to<br/>\nforce people to learn.

Yes sometime things go wrong but not<br/>\nusually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI start to wonder if the adults in children&#39;s lives don&#39;t have enough<br/>\ninterests of their own and wind up obsessed with their children&#39;s<br/>\nlives.
