Maybe *they&#39;d* prefer everyone slept in the same room so what kind of gift have we really given? Why should we assume they even want what we are giving them?+++<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to respond to this with a story. When we moved into our house 3 years ago we parents were so pleased that we could provide SEPARATE bedrooms for our then 4 and almost 6 year old. So we went on to have another baby and she has stayed with us in our room in our bed since her birth there almost two years ago. (The other two had slept with us too until they began to sleep together in their room.) A few weeks ago we were talking - the kids and I - and I said wouldnt it be nice to have a play room for all of your toys? They said well we could move our beds in one room and have the other as our play room. I said well that would be cool, but you have to convince dad first. They asked him and he said ok. I then said are you sure about this I mean I thought you liked having your own rooms. They said no you never asked us if we wanted to be apart you just put us in our own rooms. I thought back and thought wow that is so true. In fact to convince my son that he wanted to sleep alone I even painted his room and made it &quot;cool&quot; for him. Did they ever want their own bedrooms? Apparently not! I wanted them to want it. I wonder how often I have done this in one way or another to them. Talk about a wake up call!!!! I just wanted to share. Have a great day!<br/>\nGod bless<br/>\nVivian<br/>\nMom to three Happy little Monkeys<br/>\nAustin 10/31/93 Sarah 8/28/95 Emmalee 8/15/00<br/>\nAnd loving wife to Randy<br/>\n<br/>\n**If fifty million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.<br/>\n-Anatole France***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36717,"nextTopicId":36729}}
