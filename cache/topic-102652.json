I have a kid who loves to stay home :-) If you can remember<br/>\none item on the list I may have saved it and can search for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the mean time, here&#39;s something Deb posted 2 years ago about ideas<br/>\nfor the winter:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have snow, or can get to snow, snowshoeing is wonderful because<br/>\nyou don&#39;t need any special skills to strap on the shoes and go have fun.<br/>\n Rental isn&#39;t expensive and most places offer group rates if you ever get<br/>\ntogether with others for the day.  We went snowshoeing on Christmas<br/>\nday... Wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid to tell rental places you&#39;re looking for the best price.<br/>\nTell them you&#39;re homeschoolers, ask for a discount,  you&#39;ll be surprised<br/>\nhow well it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndoor ice rinks are fun, if you have one in a mall nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to the indoor climbing wall at a mountaineering shop.   The wall is<br/>\nfifteen dollars per hour but we only ever paid the full price once, our<br/>\nfirst time, and since then we often go for free, because we know the slow<br/>\ntimes and because Dylan isn&#39;t loud or wild and any friends he takes are<br/>\nnice too.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are indoor archery ranges, look in your yellow pages or call a<br/>\nsporting goods shop.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are go cart tracks, and while the one near me (54 miles away) is<br/>\noutdoor I&#39;ve heard of indoor tracks.  Make an appointment and go as a<br/>\ngroup and get a good rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaint Ball!<br/>\n<br/>\nBowling, if you like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDinner theater.<br/>\n<br/>\nHot springs!   Nothing like a skinny dip on a cold and rainy day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwimming, in a suit, at the public pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpelunking.  And if no one&#39;s experienced, a guided tour through a cavern.<br/>\n<br/>\nA one time visit to a belly dancing class.<br/>\nDinner out where said belly dancers entertain.<br/>\n<br/>\nHike.  Yes it can be wet, but that&#39;s half the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo play basket ball at the community gym.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to the police station and get a tour.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to the fire department and do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve gone on picnics on the coldest of cold days.   There is a big<br/>\nshelter, open at one end with a big fire pit that was built by the snow<br/>\nmobile club up at a campground near us.   We&#39;ve gone there on cold day&#39;s<br/>\nwith thermos&#39;s full of hot soup or stir fry, built a fire,  had fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Forest Service rents cabins for recreational use.  They&#39;re often<br/>\nbooked during hunting season, but you can get them for just one day,<br/>\nbuild a fire, live like pioneers for a few hours.  Take a deck of<br/>\ncards.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit an animal rescue center and play with the puppies.   Take them a<br/>\nbag of critter food and stay all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit a ghost town.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to the Zoo.  (our nearest zoo is six hours away)<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to a pet store where they&#39;ll let your kids hold the parrots and<br/>\nferrets.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall your wildlife biologist and find out where the nearest raptor center<br/>\nis.  Go look at awesome birds.<br/>\nOr just go talk to the biologist.  He can tell you about great places to<br/>\ngo watch wildlife.  He&#39;ll give you free posters.<br/>\n<br/>\nFree posters from the Forest Service office too!<br/>\n<br/>\nGo see your county extension agent.  They sometimes have cool bug<br/>\ncollections.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe vet has gross posters about hoof and mouth disease and tape worms and<br/>\nwood ticks.   They&#39;re FREE!<br/>\nYou&#39;re boys will love you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSee how much free stuff you can find in one day!<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sock puppets and put on a puppet show.   We still have old paper bag<br/>\npuppets from years ago.   Mr. Glad Sack, Mr. Bad Sack, Mr. Mad Sack...<br/>\n<br/>\nPull out the sheets and drape your furniture and make tunnels all over<br/>\nthe house. Your cats will love it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit a fish hatchery.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to a music store and play every instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to a game store and play every board game you&#39;ve never seen before.<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo arcade!    They&#39;re still around, one near me still has a Pac Man<br/>\ngame!  <br/>\n<br/>\nGo to tall buildings and ride the express elevators.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to an underground parking garage and sing, or if you can&#39;t sing howl<br/>\nlike hyenas. <br/>\n<br/>\nFind a pond and feed ducks.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoin a gun club and target shoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraft stores offer kid classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome improvement stores offer building projects for kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiber arts stores let you try their looms.<br/>\n<br/>\nElectronics stores let you drive the little radio controlled cars.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit a cabinet maker.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake candles.<br/>\nMake soap.<br/>\nMake ice cream.<br/>\nMake paper.<br/>\nMake a braid rug.<br/>\nMicrowave old cd&#39;s then make a mobile.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaper mache!<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a barbecue.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit art galleries, museums, national historic sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall around to the museums in your area and find out what programs they<br/>\noffer.  Get on their mailing lists and go to the events.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall the universities and do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind an astronomy club and go to star parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found so many interesting things to do around our little town just<br/>\nby talking with people and asking questions.   I ask everyone questions<br/>\nabout what they like to do, etc.  I have met so many people with<br/>\ninteresting hobbies who have been happy to share what they know with my<br/>\nson and show him their collections.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe man who runs the local green house, lets us help transplant<br/>\nseedlings.  He grows worms too, and lets Dylan dig around in the worm<br/>\nbeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guy who works at the newspaper speaks Chinese and draws cartoons.<br/>\nHe&#39;s given Dylan lots of pointers about where to get good paper and story<br/>\nboards, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe old guy at the antique shop was a college professor and is a huge<br/>\nMontana History buff, whenever Dylan has questions, we go browse the<br/>\nantiques. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lady at the flower shop keeps birds and lets Dylan hold them when we<br/>\nvisit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mayor builds stock cars.  He sometimes drives them to work.  When we<br/>\nsee one parked on main street we stop in and say hello.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe old guy across the street collects Chalmers tractors and the man at<br/>\nthe sandwich shop collects John Deere.   They love to show kids their<br/>\ntoys!<br/>\n<br/>\nCool things are everywhere, summer and winter.   David and Dylan went to<br/>\nthe tennis court on Sunday and tried to play with snow balls.
