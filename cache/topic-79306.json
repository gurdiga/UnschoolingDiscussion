He said take the <br/>\nmagnet and hold it over (about 2 inches over, not directly ON the TV screen) the <br/>\ngreen area and pull the magnet toward the edge. You will have to do this <br/>\nrepeatedly. Doing this will pull the colors off the screen. He also said it <br/>\ndepends on how long the magnet was on the screen or on top of the TV. If it was just <br/>\nfor a second, then it should be easy for you to pull off. If it was on for <br/>\nminutes, then you might have to get a new TV. But that isn&#39;t always true either.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, a few years back.... I was rearranging our living room and I stacked <br/>\nall of my DH&#39;s stereo speakers on top of the TV. They were up there for about 10 <br/>\nminutes when Darin came home, took one look at what I had done to get things <br/>\nout of my way and asked me calmly if we had $800 because he wanted a new TV. I <br/>\nhad NO idea that some speakers have magnets in them! Lucky for us, Darin can <br/>\nfix these things. We still have the TV and it still looks as good as it did <br/>\nthe day we bought it. Except for that inch of dust on it! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople always call it luck when you&#39;ve acted more sensibly than they have. <br/>\nAnne Tyler <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] OT TV vs Magnet question","postDate":"1062074819","msgId":79311,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Yy4yMzI0YmY3Yy4yYzdmNTNjM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79308,"nextInTopic":79313,"prevInTime":79310,"nextInTime":79312,"topicId":79306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/28/2003 7:43:37 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
