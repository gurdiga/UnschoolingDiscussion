He reduced altitude and<br/>\n spotted a woman below. He descended a bit more and shouted, &quot;Excuse me,<br/>\n can<br/>\n you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I<br/>\n don&#39;t<br/>\n know where I am.&quot;<br/>\n The woman below replied, &quot;You are in a hot air balloon hovering<br/>\n approximately 30 feet above the ground. You are between 40 and 41 degrees<br/>\n north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.<br/>\n &quot;You must be an engineer,&quot; said the balloonist.<br/>\n &quot;I am,&quot; replied the woman, &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br/>\n &quot;Well,&quot; answered the balloonist, &quot;everything you told me is technically<br/>\n correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the<br/>\n fact<br/>\n is I am still lost. Frankly, you&#39;ve not been much help so far.&quot;<br/>\n The woman below responded, &quot;You must be a manager.&quot;<br/>\n &quot;I am,&quot; replied the balloonist, &quot;but how did you know?&quot;<br/>\n &quot;Well,&quot; said the woman, &quot;you don&#39;t know where you are or where you are<br/>\n going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot<br/>\n air.<br/>\n You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me<br/>\n to<br/>\n solve your problem.  The fact is you are in exactly the same position you<br/>\n were in before we met, but now, somehow, it&#39;s my fault.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13078,"nextTopicId":12872}}
