Anyway, they don&#39;t take up much room now and with any luck at all, they&#39;ll have a volume control on them!!!!<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Karin Curtin","from":"&quot;Karin Curtin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"t8q0NeHb1oIkjiVtUFzeKXi3q6yW5j8A_Dmeja5KdZm9lNhoDMc5p-brQa4QzA6f32O6OYyMAAfYi2By4mHx9AG2tcJG46j7","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: encouraging writing & rock stars","postDate":"1006906624","msgId":28713,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWMxNzdhMiQwMjFkY2ZjMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDY4OTQ3MzguMjU1MC40ODEwMS5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwwMDA3MDFjMTc3OTYkN2QwMjdmODAkZWE4OTg1MGFAcGF2aWxpb24+IDwwMWJkMDFjMTc3OTgkMDU1NzgyODAkMDIwMWE4YzBAem9vb2cub3JnPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28715,"prevInTime":28712,"nextInTime":28714,"topicId":28713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sarah, I think that s cool about your daughter wanting to be a rock star.
