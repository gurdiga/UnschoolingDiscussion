Top<br/>\n&gt; Bottom , and a middle of batting, can be commercial,<br/>\n&gt; natural, or even and old blanket, or another old<br/>\n&gt; quilt, or for summer use, just another piece of<br/>\n&gt; fabric.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To piece the pieces together you can just sew the<br/>\n&gt; edges together on the wrong sides or add pieces betwen<br/>\n&gt; the squares to make a pattern of your choice.   When<br/>\n&gt; you have a all of the pieces included layer this &quot;top&quot;<br/>\n&gt; on the batting you have chosen and the backing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide you need another fabric between each block...take a look at a<br/>\nquilt book at the library or fabric store.  You&#39;ll probably find some<br/>\npictures of quilts that look like a grid with &#39;picture&#39; squares between the<br/>\nlines.  When I&#39;m making this type of quilt I find the hardest part is<br/>\nfinding a single fabric that looks good with all the different squares.<br/>\nSo, here&#39;s my tip &lt;drum roll, please!  &lt;G&gt; &gt;  Take the squares with you to<br/>\nthe fabric store.  Pick out several fabrics that you like and think might go<br/>\nwith the handprint squares (or most of them!).  Then ask the nice ladies at<br/>\nthe fabric store if you can use an empty cutting table.  (I&#39;ve never had<br/>\nthem refuse and you&#39;ll probably even get lots of help!  &lt;G&gt;)  Lay out a<br/>\ncouple of yards of the bolts of fabric on the table, spreading them out one<br/>\nat a time.  Lay your squares on top of the fabric in very random order (you<br/>\naren&#39;t finishing the quilt at this time).  When you find the one you like,<br/>\nbuy it!  Don&#39;t try to analyze why you like or if it&#39;s the &#39;right&#39; fabric.<br/>\nIf you like it at first glance, you&#39;ll love it when it is finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has surprised me about this is how often I go for a dark color for the<br/>\nlattice work (the strips between squares).  It seems to set off each square<br/>\nso they are all pleasant individually and collectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen proceed as Sharon suggested.  I would definitely consider tying this<br/>\nquilt rather than traditionally quilting it.  OTOH it depends on your<br/>\nultimate goal.  If you have a desire to learn how to &#39;quilt&#39; this is a great<br/>\ntime to do so.  Pick a design (or several) that you like and quilt them on<br/>\nthe lattice between squares.  If your desire is simply to finish the quilt,<br/>\ngo with tied!  If you&#39;re quick about it, you can have the whole thing<br/>\nfinished in a weekend...a week if you&#39;re persistent but have to work on it<br/>\nin small pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny beginning quilting book can give you pictures about how to do this.<br/>\nDon&#39;t buy one at this point unless it&#39;s something you&#39;ll want to be doing<br/>\nfor a long time, though!  It&#39;s too addictive!  Your local library is bound<br/>\nto have something.  Or you can look it up on the internet using a search<br/>\nengine and &#39;how to make a quilt&#39; or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nEiraul </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Rlw3dFWdeRFT3wXDWvQjTqbMV4iKjU-_TLXI3iA4_YeiLb3i11DG92FMCa_9rBORwfpf5CF6HVZSg3q6-zYcgpjgoZcCqxvQ55yC4g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Quilting","postDate":"991146941","msgId":22162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNTI5MTQzNTQxLjg0MjMwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlldjN1bCttbnJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22129,"nextInTopic":22196,"prevInTime":22161,"nextInTime":22163,"topicId":22059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The pictures will last much<br/>\nlonger, and as the back is not for viewing, you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to be so carefull.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo piece the pieces together you can just sew the<br/>\nedges together on the wrong sides or add pieces betwen<br/>\nthe squares to make a pattern of your choice.   When<br/>\nyou have a all of the pieces included layer this &quot;top&quot;<br/>\non the batting you have chosen and the backing.  For a<br/>\nbacking muslin works well as it is easy to push a<br/>\nneedle through.  When this is all situated to please<br/>\nyou either baste or pin it in place.  or if it is<br/>\nsmall enough skip that.For a really &quot;quick and easy&quot;<br/>\nquilt just &quot;tie&quot; the layers together.  You can use a<br/>\nreally big needle and yarn or an embroidery needle and<br/>\nuse embroidery floss or crochette thread ( I like<br/>\ncrochette thread becuase I can see it easily).  Poke<br/>\nthe needle through from the top to the bottom, turn<br/>\nand poke it back up.  Tie a knot.  One that doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncome undone! If you are makeing a hanging you can tie<br/>\nor sew on beads or buttons or charms or other little<br/>\nkeepsakes.  For a bedcover these would be lumpy.  When<br/>\nyou have decided that it will stay together OK. Sew<br/>\nsoemthing around the edges to keep the batting (middle<br/>\nlayer) from sticking out.  This can be as simple<br/>\n(prefolded quilt binding....from notions section of<br/>\nfabric store) or a complicated as you like. Just sew<br/>\n(ha!) it covers all the raw edges.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of a giant pot holder.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It is so impressive how someone can take a bunch of fabric and turn into almost into a photograph! I&#39;ve seen some gorgeous ones in my quilt magazines. I&#39;d love to see your designs. I&#39;ve found out that I enjoy the planning and piecing stages, but not necessarily the actual quilting and finishing. I really love modifying existing designs and creating my own. I hope that doesn&#39;t mean that I won&#39;t finish most of what I start....that&#39;s a bad trait I have already. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first weekend in April this year was the Annual Mennonite Churches Relief Show and Sale in Hutchinson, KS, about an hour from me. Last year, I wasn&#39;t that interested--this year it rained most of the time. Bummer! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Mennonite churches in this area (and there are tons) have their ladies make quilts year round (by hand, of course) to donate to this auction and then give the money to charities. The quilts go on view on Friday and bidding starts on that Saturday. They raise several thousands of dollars--the quilts themselves bring anywhere from $500 to $4500 each! And they usually have a minimum of about 500 quilts on display! <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the quilts are traditional, but there are quite a variety as well. Next year, *nothing* will stop me!  I can leave the checkbook home--I don&#39;t have that kind of money!! BUT I&#39;m bringing my camera!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping my mil and I can go to the &quot;big&quot; show in Houston in November...hubby is saving his pennies---he says it&#39;ll be our Christmas present if he can afford it! What a sweetheart! Pretty understanding fellow--raised by a quilter and married to a quilter. He tolerates our fabric, books, tools, and all the other little things that are just a *necessity* for this expensive love affair with quilting! Nothing about it is cheap!But, like I tell him--he buys Craftsman tools, because you want quality so it&#39;ll last and you have to have one of everything, so you can have the right tool for the job....that&#39;s just like quilters!<br/>\n<br/>\nTerri <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Helen Hegener <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 28, 2001 12:49 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Quilting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ah, well... I have to admit I do mine with the machine. Just don&#39;t <br/>\n  have the patience to do them by hand - when I have that much time I <br/>\n  prefer to mess about with watercolors instead. I do admire the <br/>\n  purists who can do them the original way, though, and maybe someday <br/>\n  I&#39;ll give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My tastes kind of run the gamut from geometric (mostly because <br/>\n  they&#39;re quick and easy) to translating watercolor patterns into <br/>\n  freestyle quilts. I have friends in Alaska who make the most <br/>\n  incredible quilts - I&#39;ll see if I can find some links to share. I got <br/>\n  into quilting at the Alaska State Fair, I was admiring all the <br/>\n  winning entries and happened to meet some of the ladies who&#39;d created <br/>\n  them, who started explaining that it wasn&#39;t all that difficult, just <br/>\n  time-consuming...
