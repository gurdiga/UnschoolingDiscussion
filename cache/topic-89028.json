If you have ever played any video games back in the old days, you must <br/>\nwatch this… Gives me some good ideas for my own game, if I ever get around to <br/>\ncoding it <br/>\nPS. if you ever were as addicted to Zork as I was, you must play Thy <br/>\nDungeonman at the end… <br/>\n<br/>\n5 comments <br/>\n<br/>\nComments<br/>\nRSS feed for comments on this post.<br/>\nThe URI to TrackBack this entry is: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fatmixx.com/wp-trackback.php/624\">http://www.fatmixx.com/wp-trackback.php/624</a><br/>\n<br/>\n1.  <br/>\nHow far did you get in Dungeonman? I “won”, but I couldn’t figure out what <br/>\nto do with the rope or the flask. <br/>\nComment by Jesse Ruderman — 1/12/2004 @ 10:28 pm <br/>\n<br/>\n2.  <br/>\nnot sure what to do with the flask, however you can hang yourself with the <br/>\nrope “take rope” I think was the command I used… Too funny. Kicking Dennis did <br/>\nnot work either  <br/>\nComment by AmericanMaid — 1/13/2004 @ 9:10 am <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  <br/>\nyou can TALK to dennis, GIVE TRINKET to dennis, and that’s about it. I worked <br/>\nfor almost an hour running basic text-based RPG commands, and barely any <br/>\nworked. You can look at stuff (LOOK at FLASK) but the reaction is always the same. <br/>\nI even tried ‘RUN STRONG_BAD_EMAIL.EXE’ and stuff like that. No good. <br/>\nComment by Jayzer — 1/14/2004 @ 5:25 pm <br/>\n<br/>\n4.  <br/>\nTry grabbing the flask a couple more times…after a couple of tries you can <br/>\nfinally grab it and something happens. <br/>\nComment by D Mann — 1/15/2004 @ 8:12 am <br/>\n<br/>\n5.  <br/>\nOr you can just say “get flask”, and it gets it.<br/>\nMy list of commands:<br/>\n“Direction” — Goes a direction, such as north, south, dennis, or not dennis. <br/>\nMust type the name of the direction in place of direction.<br/>\n“Get ___” — Used to get an item.<br/>\n“Take ____” — Used to take an item. See “Get ___”<br/>\n“Dance” — This one’s great. Makes you dance.<br/>\n“Talk ____” — Talks to someone/thing. If you choose someone who’s not a <br/>\nregistered person to talk to, it brings up a funny message. (&quot;Talk someone from <br/>\nwork&quot;)<br/>\n“Look ___” — Looks at something. If it doesn’t have a pre-set message, it <br/>\nbrings up a default.<br/>\n“Go ____” — Same as direction. If it’s not a pre-set direction, you get a <br/>\ndefault message.<br/>\nThat’s all I can recall. There’s probably more I know, but they’re not <br/>\nspringing to mind. <br/>\nComment by The Great Moo — 1/15/2004 @ 11:09 am</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88766,"nextTopicId":89012}}
