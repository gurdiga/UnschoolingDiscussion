If you go to Universal Studios (a <br/>\nbig theme park) you&#39;ll see more &quot;Hollywood&quot; and have a lot of fun - <br/>\ntake the back lot tram tour, which is how the whole thing got started <br/>\nand don&#39;t miss the special effects show and the &quot;animals in the movies&quot; <br/>\nshow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my German relatives come here, they want to go to the beach a lot. <br/>\nDepending on time of year and where you&#39;re staying, we can tell you <br/>\nwhich beaches are fun for what. You might want to try to go to the <br/>\nCabrillo Marine Museum and tidepools and take a harbor cruise at the <br/>\nLong Beach/Los Angeles Harbor.  If you are driving from Los Angeles to <br/>\nSacramento, a nice way to do it is to drive up Highway 101 to San Jose <br/>\nfirst and go to the Tech Museum and then drive from there to <br/>\nSacramento. Hwy 101 is a FAR nicer drive than going straight from LA to <br/>\nSacramento and you can make a quick stop in Santa Barbara or other <br/>\nbeach towns. My sister-in-law, who is German, was named Barbara because <br/>\nher parents came here on their honeymoon and her mother fell so in love <br/>\nwith Santa Barbara.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sacramento has an awesome train museum - it is at the north end of Old <br/>\nTown Sacramento. Don&#39;t miss that. Sacramento has the state capitol <br/>\nbuilding - the park around it is a great place for a picnic - it is <br/>\nlovely and there are lots of squirrels, the capitol building tour would <br/>\nbe boring for a five year old, but walking around in the building for <br/>\n20 minutes or so would not be, because the rotunda is cool, you can be <br/>\nup about 4 floors and look up into the dome or look down below. I&#39;d <br/>\nskip the Golden State Museum, for a five year old it would be mostly <br/>\nboring. Sutter&#39;s fort can be pretty cool, especially if they have some <br/>\nliving history type of stuff going on, which they often do. This can be <br/>\na fairly short stop, though, not an all-day visit, and it is right in <br/>\ntown. The California State Indian Museum is on the same property as <br/>\nSutter&#39;s Fort and, again, my German relatives, especially the kids, <br/>\nhave always REALLY enjoyed that - since it is so uniquely American and <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t have other chances to see real Indian stuff. I&#39;d think that <br/>\nan hour or so spent there would be fun for a 5 yo, but not much longer <br/>\nsince it is all looking, no activity. Since you can go to Sutter&#39;s Fort <br/>\nAND the Indian museum at the same place - well worth going.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120767120,"authorName":"Jocelyn Vilter","from":"Jocelyn Vilter &lt;jocelyn@...&gt;","profile":"jocelynv2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] what shouldn&#39;t we miss / trip to Los\tAngeles","postDate":"1075129036","msgId":89887,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDM0E2QUNDLjE1RUM5JUpvY2VseW5AVmlsdGVyLnVzPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwMTUxNDE5LjMwNDA1MDNAYmliLnVuaS13dXBwZXJ0YWwuZGU+"},"prevInTopic":89874,"nextInTopic":89894,"prevInTime":89886,"nextInTime":89888,"topicId":89873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is Travel Town in Griffith Park, in Los Angeles, which is free.
