Just punch the above description into your google engine and you should find some wonderful support for communal living. The trick, I think, is to find like minded folk near enough that it will work. Also, look for books on simplifying like Extreme simplicity or choosing simplicity. They also talk about communities.Cheers, Joan<br/>\n<br/>\njmcseals SEALS &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmcseals@...\">jmcseals@...</a>&gt; wrote:&lt;&lt;I think what stresses me the most is when I see these families in their <br/>\nSUV&#39;s<br/>\nor not counting what is in their cart at the store.
