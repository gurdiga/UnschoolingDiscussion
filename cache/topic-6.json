When asking <br/>\nabout homeschooling compliance, please always, ALWAYS tell us what is <br/>\nyour state of residency. There are a few of us here that can help but <br/>\nthat is the most important piece of information we need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, everybody would do well to check their state&#39;s <br/>\nhomeschooling laws. The National Home Educators Network <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a>&gt;www.nhen.org has a wonderful website with all <br/>\nthe state&#39;s homeschooling laws and/or regulations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost states have compulsory education laws that are supposed to <br/>\nensure all children in the state receive &quot;equivalent instruction&quot;; <br/>\nmeaning an education comparable to the one they would receive at a <br/>\npublic school. Here in NY, one of the state&#39;s with the worst <br/>\nhomeschooling regulations in the nation, we have very specific <br/>\ncurriculum guidelines that, even though we are supposed to start <br/>\ncomplying with by first grade, they are really retroactive to <br/>\nkindergarten. Yes, NY kids are supposed to have knowledge of certain <br/>\ntopics subjects by the time they enter 1st grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, unschooling is something that we would not announce <br/>\nto the district nor would we mention on the quarterly reports we are <br/>\nsupposed to submit for the next 12 years of homeschooling <br/>\n&quot;instruction&quot;. Why? Because unschooling, technically (and I am saying <br/>\ntechnically because there are no laws that I know of that refer <br/>\nspecifically to unschooling) would not be allowed in most states with <br/>\ncompulsory and equivalency laws.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo arm yourself ALWAYS with the exact wording of your state&#39;s laws or <br/>\nregulations and NEVER and I mean, NEVER give them more than what they <br/>\nask. You are doing yourself and all homeschoolers in your state a <br/>\ndisservice. As it is, homeschooling should be off-limits to public <br/>\nschools. Why would I want to give my child an education equivalent to <br/>\na public school if I am not put under the same grind if I were to pay <br/>\n$16,000 for private education? And no, in NY the SED does not have <br/>\nany say on how private (or in our case &quot;non-public&quot;) schools are run. <br/>\nThey have guidelines only --not even regulations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo check out nhen.org.  They are a wonderful resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a message dated 9/19/2002 10:54:26 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Do your state laws say that you have to offer to let them review a<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  portfolio?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Local homeschool support groups can usually give you accurate info about<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  what it required.

That said, thanks for having me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my story, in brief: my son Andrew (8/4th grade) has been <br/>\nlabeled since Kindergarten. Now he is at the point where he thinks <br/>\nhe&#39;s &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t change&quot;. (Bet you&#39;ve heard this story before..) <br/>\nAt any rate, I am sick to death of this. My child can go anywhere and <br/>\nbe complimented on his manners and kind attitude, except that one <br/>\nschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are. (In CT, by the way.) My problem now is a notice of <br/>\nintent. I wrote a letter to the superintendant, whom I know, and the <br/>\nprincipal, whom I&#39;ve worked with. It said something like, &quot;We&#39;ll be <br/>\nhome schooling Andrew starting on this date.. We feel this is the <br/>\nmost positive enviornment for him.. You are welcome to review my <br/>\nportfolio at any time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been told I don&#39;t have to notify, I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s very <br/>\nimportant to notify. I realize I&#39;m opening myself up if I offer my <br/>\nportfolio but in all honesty, I&#39;d rather go by the books the first <br/>\nyear and see what happens. Worst comes to worse, they start citing <br/>\nlaws and threaten to take my child, I&#39;ll get a lawyer. Best case <br/>\nscenario, they ignore me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe letter I wrote doesn&#39;t ask for a reply, however. Do they need to <br/>\nacknowledge me?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, all, for any input. Very glad to be here, and again, please <br/>\nexcuse me jumping right in!<br/>\nFiona</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"::she just is::","from":"&quot;::she just is::&quot; &lt;OmegaMolecule@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ANmV14iMV5bHBXjz3oSaI05U-0WHrwNV74Nx9NJpRpXQpLvfE0KH4TZsvuDlDF2ZT9NnVriKs4awq5i2F9sEDYt2Imd6tm3sYU7DikqtLeGpRUzaV_c","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hi","postDate":"928191958","msgId":6,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMC42Ljk1OTI2OTczOUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44346,"prevInTime":5,"nextInTime":7,"topicId":6,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I just signed up on here yesterday, so I didn t get your introductory message.
