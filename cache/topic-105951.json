You can also tell it to just record the new <br/>\nepisodes so it will skip over repeats over Christmas and catch season <br/>\npremieres even if they start at a goofy time of the TV season.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you can watch your shows when you want to instead of when the <br/>\nstations decide to put them on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when my daughter was younger she often watched TV because she <br/>\nwas afraid of missing something.
