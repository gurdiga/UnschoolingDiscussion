I knew no other<br/>\nhsers<br/>\n&gt; but one family who did school at home, which I didn&#39;t feel would work in<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; situation, but figured a tiny bit of structure would be needed.  However,<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; oldest son&#39;s intense need to deschool led directly to unschooling, and we<br/>\n&gt; never looked back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The boys are now very nearly 21 (2 weeks) and 18.  The elder is in the<br/>\nArmy,<br/>\n&gt; has been since before he turned 18, and is doing very well.  Getting him<br/>\nin<br/>\n.the Army was a challenge as our Clonlara diploma was not recognized as<br/>\n&gt; valid.  But we got past that hurdle, then 6 weeks after Chris joined, my<br/>\ndh<br/>\n&gt; retired from the Army, and we left TX to move onto our land in MI, where<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; now have a small farm.  The younger son left home a few weeks after his<br/>\n18th<br/>\n&gt; birthday to move *back* to TX :) where he&#39;s employed by an Internet<br/>\necommerce<br/>\n&gt; company, and making a very nice salary along with 80 hour workweeks.<br/>\n&gt; Personally, I hope he quits and finds something less stressful, but that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what he wants for now :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My youngest child is a girl, 8 going on 18, who is exceptionally sensitive<br/>\n&gt; and strongwilled, so life is never dull.  At the moment she&#39;s minding the<br/>\n&gt; batch of 28 baby chicks we picked up this morning.  We still unschool, in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; manner I&#39;ve been told is nowadays called &#39;radical unschooling&#39;, meaning,<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; told, folks who don&#39;t use unit studies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now for the comment.  Susan wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; imo the fact that you wanted to learn piano and the opportunity to<br/>\nacquire<br/>\n&gt; this skill was not afforded to you would say to me that you were not<br/>\n&gt; unschooled because your parents did not respect your desires and did not<br/>\n&gt; follow your lead.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I strongly disagree with this :)  Unschooling, IMO, is indeed about<br/>\nfollowing<br/>\n&gt; the child&#39;s lead--I like to refer to it as child-led learning.  However,<br/>\n&gt; parents are not obligated to allow the child to lead anywhere she wants!<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think you&#39;d let your child lead you to give her lessons in arson, if<br/>\n&gt; she were interested in burning things, would you? :)  There are always<br/>\nlimits<br/>\n&gt; in the real world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If my daughter had her way, we&#39;d provide gymnastics, swimming, horseback<br/>\n&gt; riding, piano lessons, and a host of other enriching activities.  I would<br/>\n&gt; love to give her ample opportunity for each and every one of these<br/>\n&gt; activities, but there&#39;s a few problems.  One, there&#39;s simply not enough<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; to do all these things; Two, we don&#39;t have the money; and Three, she is<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; real serious about any of the ones she&#39;s tried so far.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where I can work out lessons that I feel are of the quality that provides<br/>\n&gt; learning with respect, for a reasonable amount of money or labor (I have<br/>\n&gt; bartered my labor for her lessons with friends), I give my daughter<br/>\nchances<br/>\n&gt; to try different activities.  But when she doesn&#39;t follow through on her<br/>\nend<br/>\n&gt; of the deal--for example, wearing the safety equipment needed, or placing<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; hands on the keys like her teachers says--then it&#39;s time to rethink the<br/>\n&gt; lessons.  Periodically we&#39;ll give her a new chance to try if she&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; interested, and if she&#39;s willing to be fully cooperative with the<br/>\n&gt; restrictions inherent in the situation, then lessons will continue as long<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; she is cooperative and we can work out any other problems.  But I&#39;m under<br/>\nno<br/>\n&gt; obligation to provide opportunities to someone who won&#39;t appreciate and<br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; the most of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If my child had a burning *need* to do something--for example, a child who<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; a serious competitive swimmer, or who finds that music, or animals, or<br/>\n&gt; whatever, is her life, then I would move heaven and earth to provide that<br/>\n&gt; opportunity.  But most kids are just experimenting, which is fine, if done<br/>\n&gt; with the understanding that it not take over the family&#39;s time and income.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, so much for my plan to lurk :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Holly<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hjshaltz@...\">hjshaltz@...</a><br/>\n&gt; HJS Studio and Shaltz Farm Shetlands and Angora Rabbits<br/>\n&gt; List Mom, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberFlock@onelist.com\">FiberFlock@onelist.com</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberProfessionals@onelist.com\">FiberProfessionals@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; High rates giving you headaches?
