That is good to know.  My grandma <br/>\ndesigned her own house and actually had that drawer put in (it was <br/>\nbeneath the stove top, not up high).  I just thought it seemed kind <br/>\nof messy -- but was fun.  The flour didn&#39;t all stay in the drawer <br/>\nwhen you opened and closed.  I don&#39;t know that it had a metal <br/>\nliner.  I can&#39;t remember her cleaning it out either. Just put more <br/>\nflour on top.  She was famous for baking about 100 pies on a weekend <br/>\nfor her church bazarre, and people ordered them ahead of time.  The <br/>\npies often exploded in the oven, and she just kind of scraped that <br/>\noff and put in another pie!  My dad had to put in a couple different <br/>\novens over the years.  We lived with her for three years, and she <br/>\ndid vacuum occasionally (she insisted on wool carpets, because the <br/>\nstains came out better she thought -- and I think she replaced <br/>\ncarpets maybe 3-4 times in 20 years) as I recall, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember much in the way of dusting or deep scrubbing or anything.  <br/>\nKitchen floor pretty dirty most of the time.  We never got sick or <br/>\nanything, still don&#39;t, so maybe she enhanced our immunity!  She was <br/>\npretty uninterested in housework, I think.  She was more likely to <br/>\nbe in the garden or making something in the kitchen sink.  All the <br/>\nhobbies she had seemed pretty messy.  It&#39;s the same with my mom, <br/>\nthough my mom is tidier and how her house looks is more important to <br/>\nher when guests come over.  I don&#39;t think my grandma was as <br/>\nconcerned about what other people thought really.  My own <br/>\nhousekeeping style is not great.  I struggle with it, though, as I <br/>\nwould actually like a cleaner house.  I&#39;m just not willing to take <br/>\nthat much time away from things I am actually interested in.  I <br/>\nfigure if I am cleaning house, I am not doing other things.  The <br/>\nthing is, if you are not naturally neat, and have not developed <br/>\ntidiness habits, you don&#39;t tend to put things in their place and <br/>\nclean up after yourself the minute you do something.  You wait until <br/>\nthe mess is huge, and then it seems like too much of an undetaking.  <br/>\nI have watched people with clean houses, and I know they put <br/>\neverything back right after they are done.  And everything has a <br/>\nproper place.  They also wipe down the table and get right to the <br/>\ndishes.  They don&#39;t leave one in the sink.  That, to me, takes an <br/>\nentirely different type of personality than I was born with or would <br/>\ntake the time to develop.  So, I suffer with messiness around me.  I <br/>\nalso don&#39;t have things set up in the house to make it easier.  Where <br/>\nthings are changes depending on when I was using them last!<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] grandma","postDate":"1044195869","msgId":57600,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MC4xYTE0MWI5MS4yYjZlODQxZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57599,"nextInTopic":57601,"prevInTime":57599,"nextInTime":57601,"topicId":57596,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/2/03 8:36:32 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
