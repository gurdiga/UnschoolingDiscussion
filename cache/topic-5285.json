I know someone like that....ME)  (or, I used to<br/>\nbe)  Anyway, he may try something, but if he can&#39;t do it well, he<br/>\nimmediately says, &quot;Oh,  I don&#39;t want to do this anymore.&quot;<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t read yet, and won&#39;t try.  Puzzles, games, drawing.... on and<br/>\non and on.<br/>\nHow should I handle this?  I can&#39;t push, I know how awful it is to feel<br/>\nlike a failure at everything.  Should I just let it go, and let him pick<br/>\nit up when he wants to?<br/>\nI have tried talking to him about.  Telling him I understand, and that I<br/>\nused to be the same way, and that now I realize that I don&#39;t have to do<br/>\neverything perfectly, just be happy with what I can do, and that with<br/>\ntime I will get better, and things will come easier.<br/>\nSometimes this behavior frustrates me, and sometimes it tears my hair<br/>\nout.<br/>\nAny ideas O wise Mommies?<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thad Martin","from":"Thad Martin &lt;tmartin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jEiY4cd_CA7d6g6Odo-kh6tTzlVySqBPjDT-jxJK2gHKJTkxXgQB17QggGm2pa9tri6lRG7JugZUsNoubXFV6GWB_PdZrX5ycQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Perfectionism","postDate":"945273946","msgId":5292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDEuNTI5Mi45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5289,"nextInTopic":5294,"prevInTime":5291,"nextInTime":5293,"topicId":5285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi i think that this is a normal part of trying to have power in the world and expressing it.   so in that way there is nothing to worry about, but ones ego","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-879394241\">hi<br/>\n<br/>\ni think that this is a normal part of trying to have power in the world and<br/>\nexpressing it.   so in that way there is nothing to worry about, but ones<br/>\nego does needs to be balanced by ones curiosity, so meeting and having a<br/>\ngood relationship with challenges is very important.   if one doesn&#39;t learn<br/>\nto appreciate the challenges life offers then one will most likely end up<br/>\nplaying it safe.   for me unschooling has to do with the relationship<br/>\nbetween the person and the unknown, not the known (because you&#39;re not<br/>\nreally learning if it&#39;s too easy).   so being a perfectionist (which is<br/>\nwhat traditional education promotes) is a good thing when used to do<br/>\nsomething well, but not good if it limits you to doing only things which<br/>\nyou know you can do well.<br/>\n<br/>\nthat said, on a practical level, my son is exactly as you describe, if he<br/>\ntry (s) something, but ...can&#39;t do it well, he immediately says, &quot;Oh,  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do this anymore.&quot;   so what i&#39;ve done is find something<br/>\nsimilar:  a puzzle, a computer game, a model, fixing the sink, anything<br/>\nconcrete and visible, and struggle with it in front of him.  for example<br/>\ni&#39;m really poor musically and we had just bought a cd rom called &#39;yoda&#39;s<br/>\nchallenge&#39; which has a music component, you have to beat out the exact<br/>\nrhythm to trigger a trap.  i struggled with this, but after more than a<br/>\ndozen attempts and trying different tricks i did repeatedly succeed,<br/>\nthereby learning a bit about keeping rhythm .   at the same time i talked<br/>\nto him about the nature of the word &#39;challenge&#39; and how much fun it really<br/>\nwas to take on challenges, because when you finally succeed it is the best<br/>\nfeeling, the feeling of accomplishment, and this feels much better than<br/>\ndoing something that you knew you could do.   then you just wait and keep<br/>\nencouraging them.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat i find is that we, as a society, get very enthusiastic when we do<br/>\nsomething right but we pretty much ignore the really great attempts that<br/>\nfail.  i think this is a real problem because most great things<br/>\n(inventions, idea etc.) are preceded by many, many failures.  so if we can<br/>\nteach our children to not fear failures but to learn from them and to<br/>\nactually relish them for what these failures teach, then our kids will<br/>\nbecome life long learners.  failures are great opportunities for us to not<br/>\nonly expand our knowledge but to face our fears and challenge them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A.
