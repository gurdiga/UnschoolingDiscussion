Housework and &#39;schoolwork&#39; are part of life.  We<br/>\ndon&#39;t give allowances and we don&#39;t pay for work done.  We consider room<br/>\nand board enough payment but if one of them wants something, they are<br/>\nmuch more likely to get it if I am happy with them than if I am not.  Use<br/>\nof the car is one of those things.  It isn&#39;t her car.  Heck, it isn&#39;t<br/>\neven mine.  The money for gas more often than not is my money.  So it&#39;s a<br/>\ntrade, if she wants something from me, I want something from her. <br/>\nBartering at it&#39;s finest and most subtle.  And if on any given week she<br/>\ndoes not feel like writing, I probably won&#39;t make an issue of it.  I<br/>\nmight make an issue of it if she does not feel like getting out of bed<br/>\nfor an entire week, but that is somethign different entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n~~~~If electricity comes from electrons...does that mean that morality<br/>\ncomes from morons?~~~~<br/>\nI sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br/>\n        Some letter of that After-life to spell;<br/>\nAnd by and by my Soul returned to me,<br/>\n        And answered, &quot;I Myself am Heaven and Hell.&quot;  --  The Rubaiyat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Janet F Hamlin","from":"&quot;Janet F Hamlin&quot; &lt;jefhdvm@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ICe3cE3nFSABGgW4CsUZlBbGWdLksVPISutykajMVvxwsskmzv10OimtToLbZRHtR5FcwMyKDU81OqGd_SqLl3S5zBx0HBaLt-M","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: for those who say I&#39;m NOT unschooling","postDate":"1000069158","msgId":24907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDYwMWMxMzk3NiQ5MjFlYzllMCQ4ZGRlZmVhOUB0aWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDAwNTM4NDEuMTMwMS40OTU0Ni5sOEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24941,"prevInTime":24906,"nextInTime":24908,"topicId":24907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ... autonomy you mean her freedom is limited if she","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-829314243\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  If she does not do any of it<br/>\n(including the weeks chores) then she looses some autonomy.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Autonomy is a synonym for freedom in the thesaurus, but if by &quot;loses some<br/>\n </span></blockquote>autonomy&quot; you mean her freedom is limited if she didn&#39;t finish her work,<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\ncontrol. &lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that she wants to achieve a goal (college or whatever) and she<br/>\nneeds to master some material in order to achieve that.  If she asks for<br/>\nsome help with that, that&#39;s still unschooling.  If you help her set a<br/>\nschedule over a period of weeks to months in order to achieve that, it&#39;s<br/>\nstill unschooling.  If she decides not to do the work or follow the<br/>\nschedule, that should be HER decision alone, and the consequences (not<br/>\ngetting into whatever program) are HERS alone, THAT is unschooling.

On<br/>\noccasion she&#39;ll come to me and ask for help.  I&#39;ll give her some suggestions<br/>\nand she&#39;ll maybe work in a workbook, trace some letters, etc.  But if after<br/>\n30 seconds she decides to go watch a video or do a watercolor or ride her<br/>\nbike, that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;m not enforcing 10 minutes several times a week to<br/>\nachieve that goal.  I may ask her every now and then if she wants to<br/>\npractice, but if she says no, that&#39;s ok with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what is being said on this list.  I haven&#39;t seen anyone trying to be<br/>\nrude, but some have been very blunt because it seems that you&#39;re not<br/>\nunderstanding this crucial point.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet, mom to Caroline, almost 7!! and Thomas, 3</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24861,"nextTopicId":24868}}
