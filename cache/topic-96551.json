This is the first <br/>\nlist that actually tackles tough issues, in a smart, straight forward, <br/>\nand thoughtful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m a mom of three kiddos - Cameron(6), Allison(3) and <br/>\nMegan(8mo.) and we&#39;ve become relaxed homeschoolers kind of on accident. <br/>\n  Something about having an infant....<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading the thread on nail biting and was really curious about <br/>\nthe poster who said that her husband gets really angry when he&#39;s <br/>\ninterrupted....  I was thinking - &quot;How does she unschool, or even <br/>\nhomeschool of any kind, in this situation?&quot;  I&#39;m really curious about <br/>\nthat. :P<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, back to the topic of emailing DH at work.  I don&#39;t know about <br/>\nother DH&#39;s, but my DH at work = unfun.  He&#39;s all business and the last <br/>\nthing I want is for him to think about personal and family issues while <br/>\nat work.  Ack!  The morning, before work, is also a bad time for him. <br/>\nThe best time, I&#39;ve found, for hubby is during dinner, or after the <br/>\nkids are in bed and we&#39;re playing our video games.  If I bring things <br/>\nup at work, or when he&#39;s thinking about work - oh my, he&#39;s a big <br/>\ngrumparoo!  And, he goes into business mode, dealing with us like we&#39;re <br/>\nhis colleagues.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to meet everyone.
