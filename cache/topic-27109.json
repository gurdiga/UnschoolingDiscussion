No matter<br/>\n&gt;what your political or ideological persuasion, the implications of the<br/>\n&gt;New USA Patriot Act could be far-reaching, and change the landscape of<br/>\n&gt;American liberty and justice for years to come.

(I was referred to the site<br/>\n&gt;by the article, and had never known of it before now.  It is certainly<br/>\n&gt;a politically left-leaning web site.)  But I think there are times<br/>\n&gt;that people of different ideological positions can see a higher<br/>\n&gt;principle from their particular vantage point.  This is one of those<br/>\n&gt;cases.

There are people in this<br/>\n&gt;administration that I like and others that I don&#39;t particularly like.<br/>\n&gt;My point here is that even though the current administration may not<br/>\n&gt;abuse this act today, it is now a part of our federal system of laws.<br/>\n&gt;Future abuse is quite probable.  So now is the time to decide whether<br/>\n&gt;or not it should be opposed or not.  We shouldn&#39;t wait until its abuse<br/>\n&gt;is obvious.  Then may be too late.

It creates a broad new definition of &quot;domestic<br/>\n&gt;terrorism&quot;<br/>\n&gt;that could sweep in people who engage in acts of political protest and<br/>\n&gt;subject them to wiretapping and enhanced penalties. [This means they<br/>\n&gt;can<br/>\n&gt;jail anyone who disagrees with them, and keep them in jail for life<br/>\n&gt;without<br/>\n&gt;a trial.]<br/>\n&gt;              On immigration specifically, the new law permits the<br/>\n&gt;detention<br/>\n&gt;of non-citizens facing deportation based merely on the Attorney<br/>\n&gt;General&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;certification that he has &quot;reasonable grounds to believe&quot; the<br/>\n&gt;non-citizen<br/>\n&gt;endangers national security. While immigration or criminal charges<br/>\n&gt;must be<br/>\n&gt;filed within seven days, these charges need not have anything to do<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;terrorism, but can be minor visa violations of the kind that normally<br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt;not result in detention at all. Non-citizens ordered removed on visa<br/>\n&gt;violations could be indefinitely detained if they are stateless, their<br/>\n&gt;country of origin refuses to accept them, or they are granted relief<br/>\n&gt;from<br/>\n&gt;deportation because they would be tortured if they were returned to<br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt;country of origin.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              It permits the Attorney General to indefinitely<br/>\n&gt;incarcerate or<br/>\n&gt;detain non-citizens based on mere suspicion, and to deny readmission<br/>\n&gt;to the<br/>\n&gt;United States of non-citizens (including lawful permanent residents)<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment. [Or, what used to<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;the First Amendment. Now, it doesn&#39;t exist.]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Let me just take a bit more of your valuable time to make<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;couple of points crystal clear, again using material from the ACLU&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;objections to passage of the Patriot Act.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Wiretapping and Intelligence Surveillance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              The wiretapping and intelligence provisions in the USA<br/>\n&gt;Patriot<br/>\n&gt;Act sound two themes: they minimize the role of a judge in ensuring<br/>\n&gt;that law<br/>\n&gt;enforcement wiretapping is conducted legally and with proper<br/>\n&gt;justification,<br/>\n&gt;and they permit use of intelligence investigative authority to by-pass<br/>\n&gt;normal criminal procedures that protect privacy. Specifically:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              1. The USA Patriot Act allows the government to use its<br/>\n&gt;intelligence gathering power to circumvent the standard that must be<br/>\n&gt;met for<br/>\n&gt;criminal wiretaps. Currently FISA surveillance, which does not contain<br/>\n&gt;many<br/>\n&gt;of the same checks and balances that govern wiretaps for criminal<br/>\n&gt;purposes,<br/>\n&gt;can be used only when foreign intelligence gathering is the primary<br/>\n&gt;purpose.<br/>\n&gt;The new law allows use of FISA surveillance authority even if the<br/>\n&gt;primary<br/>\n&gt;purpose were a criminal investigation. Intelligence surveillance<br/>\n&gt;merely<br/>\n&gt;needs to be only a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This provision authorizes<br/>\n&gt;unconstitutional physical searches and wiretaps: though it is<br/>\n&gt;searching<br/>\n&gt;primarily for evidence of crime, law enforcement conducts a search<br/>\n&gt;without<br/>\n&gt;probable cause of crime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              2. The USA Patriot Act extends a very low threshold of<br/>\n&gt;proof for<br/>\n&gt;access to Internet communications that are far more revealing than<br/>\n&gt;numbers<br/>\n&gt;dialed on a phone. Under current law, a law enforcement agent can get<br/>\n&gt;a pen<br/>\n&gt;register or trap and trace order requiring the telephone company to<br/>\n&gt;reveal<br/>\n&gt;the numbers dialed to and from a particular phone. To get such an<br/>\n&gt;order, law<br/>\n&gt;enforcement must simply certify to a judge  who must grant the<br/>\n&gt;order  that<br/>\n&gt;the information to be obtained is &quot;relevant to an ongoing criminal<br/>\n&gt;investigation.&quot; This is a very low level of proof, far less than<br/>\n&gt;probable<br/>\n&gt;cause. This provision apparently applies to law enforcement efforts to<br/>\n&gt;determine what websites a person had visited, which is like giving law<br/>\n&gt;enforcement the power  based only on its own certification  to<br/>\n&gt;require the<br/>\n&gt;librarian to report on the books you had perused while visiting the<br/>\n&gt;public<br/>\n&gt;library. This provision extends a low standard of proof  far less<br/>\n&gt;than<br/>\n&gt;probable cause  to actual &quot;content&quot; information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              3. In allowing for &quot;nationwide service&quot; of pen register<br/>\n&gt;and trap<br/>\n&gt;and trace orders, the law further marginalizes the role of the<br/>\n&gt;judiciary. It<br/>\n&gt;authorizes what would be the equivalent of a blank warrant in the<br/>\n&gt;physical<br/>\n&gt;world: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills<br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;the places to be searched. This is not consistent with the important<br/>\n&gt;Fourth<br/>\n&gt;Amendment privacy protection of requiring that warrants specify the<br/>\n&gt;place to<br/>\n&gt;be searched. Under this legislation, a judge is unable to meaningfully<br/>\n&gt;monitor the extent to which her order was being used to access<br/>\n&gt;information<br/>\n&gt;about Internet communications.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              4. The Act also grants the FBI broad access in<br/>\n&gt;&quot;intelligence&quot;<br/>\n&gt;investigations to records about a person maintained by a business. The<br/>\n&gt;FBI<br/>\n&gt;need only certify to a court that it is conducting an intelligence<br/>\n&gt;investigation and that the records it seeks may be relevant. With this<br/>\n&gt;new<br/>\n&gt;power, the FBI can force a business to turn over a person&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;educational,<br/>\n&gt;medical, financial, mental health and travel records based on a very<br/>\n&gt;low<br/>\n&gt;standard of proof and without meaningful judicial oversight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              The ACLU noted that the FBI already had broad authority to<br/>\n&gt;monitor telephone and Internet communications. Most of the changes<br/>\n&gt;apply not<br/>\n&gt;just to surveillance of terrorists, but instead to all surveillance in<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;United States. [All surveillance. The WTO geeks will love this one.<br/>\n&gt;Now we<br/>\n&gt;can be just like China.]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Law enforcement authorities -- even when they are required<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;obtain court orders - have great leeway under current law to<br/>\n&gt;investigate<br/>\n&gt;suspects in terrorist attacks. Current law already provided, for<br/>\n&gt;example,<br/>\n&gt;that wiretaps can be obtained for the crimes involved in terrorist<br/>\n&gt;attacks,<br/>\n&gt;including destruction of aircraft and aircraft piracy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              The FBI also already had authority to intercept these<br/>\n&gt;communications without showing probable cause of crime for<br/>\n&gt;&quot;intelligence&quot;<br/>\n&gt;purposes under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In fact,<br/>\n&gt;FISA<br/>\n&gt;wiretaps now exceed wiretapping for all domestic criminal<br/>\n&gt;investigations.<br/>\n&gt;The standards for obtaining a FISA wiretap are lower than the<br/>\n&gt;standards for<br/>\n&gt;obtaining a criminal wiretap.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              Criminal Justice<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              The law dramatically expands the use of secret searches.<br/>\n&gt;Normally, a person is notified when law enforcement conducts a search.<br/>\n&gt;In<br/>\n&gt;some cases regarding searches for electronic information, law<br/>\n&gt;enforcement<br/>\n&gt;authorities can get court permission to delay notification of a<br/>\n&gt;search. The<br/>\n&gt;USA Patriot Act extends the authority of the government to request<br/>\n&gt;&quot;secret<br/>\n&gt;searches&quot; to every criminal case. This vast expansion of power goes<br/>\n&gt;far<br/>\n&gt;beyond anything necessary to conduct terrorism investigations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              The Act also allows for the broad sharing of sensitive<br/>\n&gt;information in criminal cases with intelligence agencies, including<br/>\n&gt;the CIA,<br/>\n&gt;the NSA, the INS and the Secret Service. It permits sharing of<br/>\n&gt;sensitive<br/>\n&gt;grand jury and wiretap information without judicial review or any<br/>\n&gt;safeguards<br/>\n&gt;regarding the future use or dissemination of such information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              These information sharing authorizations and mandates<br/>\n&gt;effectively put the CIA back in the business of spying on Americans:<br/>\n&gt;Once<br/>\n&gt;the CIA makes clear the kind of information it seeks, law enforcement<br/>\n&gt;agencies can use tools like wiretaps and intelligence searches to<br/>\n&gt;provide<br/>\n&gt;data to the CIA. In fact, the law specifically gives the Director of<br/>\n&gt;Central<br/>\n&gt;Intelligence - who heads the CIA -- the power to identify domestic<br/>\n&gt;intelligence requirements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              The law also creates a new crime of &quot;domestic terrorism.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;The<br/>\n&gt;new offense threatens to transform protesters into terrorists if they<br/>\n&gt;engage<br/>\n&gt;in conduct that &quot;involves acts dangerous to human life.&quot; Members of<br/>\n&gt;Operation Rescue, the Environmental Liberation Front and Greenpeace,<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;example, have all engaged in activities that could subject them to<br/>\n&gt;prosecution as terrorists. Then, under this law, the dominos begin to<br/>\n&gt;fall.<br/>\n&gt;Those who provide lodging or other assistance to these &quot;domestic<br/>\n&gt;terrorists&quot;<br/>\n&gt;could have their homes wiretapped and could be prosecuted.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              [If you have any doubt that these are the trappings of a<br/>\n&gt;police<br/>\n&gt;state, then you need to go back to elementary school and read about<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;Constitution, which we no longer have.]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;              [Fox News Channel reports tonight that 90% of the American<br/>\n&gt;people are really happy with what Bush has done.
