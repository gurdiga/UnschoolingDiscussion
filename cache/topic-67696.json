You must have a full <br/>\nsized van in order for each person to have their own belt?  That&#39;s <br/>\none thing I don&#39;t like about seat belt laws--it can be restrictive of <br/>\npeople going places because they don&#39;t have big enough cars to buckle <br/>\neveryone in.  I know I&#39;ve already not taken friends along to <br/>\nactivities because we didn&#39;t have enough belts, although we could <br/>\nhave squeezed 4 kids in the back seat of the minivan.  People with <br/>\nlarge families might be stuck home much of the time because they <br/>\ncan&#39;t afford a full size van.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd besides that, there&#39;s the issue of freedom.  It&#39;s probably true <br/>\nthat seatbelts save lives--usually, at least.  I just think that we <br/>\nshould have the freedom to decide issues like that for ourselves <br/>\nwithout big brother looking over our shoulder deciding for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; <br/>\n&lt;jmcseals@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;Virginia doesn&#39;t look kindly on kids out of seat belts!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to say Texas doesn&#39;t either, but I cannot tell you how <br/>\n </span></blockquote>many times <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we see a car FULL of adults in belts with children crammed <br/>\n </span></blockquote>everywhere but <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; under the hood!
