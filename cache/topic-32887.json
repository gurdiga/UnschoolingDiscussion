Here is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1468732480\">Example:  Child wants music lessons.  Parent pays.  Child may or may not<br/>\nwant to go consistently.  Does parent let them skip or force<br/>\n&quot;responsibility&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my thinking on this.  If a child is old enough to research getting<br/>\nlessons (knows when and where, what type of instrument he/she is interested<br/>\nin), the child can probably handle a &quot;budget&quot;.  Why not sit down as a family<br/>\ndiscuss how much money is available for things like lessons, classes, toys,<br/>\ngizmos, etc.?  Let the child know how much money they have available to<br/>\nthem, their &quot;budget&quot; if you will, and let them decide how to spend it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat takes the burden of &quot;money wasted&quot; off the parent if the child isn&#39;t<br/>\nreally interested in the class or whatever.  The child will choose to spend<br/>\nmoney on things they enjoy, just like adults do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32317,"nextTopicId":32893}}
