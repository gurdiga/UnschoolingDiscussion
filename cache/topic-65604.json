All they&#39;re given is artificial and meaningless deadlines for which<br/>\nthere may or may not be a penalty for failing to prepare or meet the<br/>\ndeadline. I rarely did homework in school, or if I did, I did it on the bus.<br/>\nCrammed for all the tests, regurgitated the knowledge and then wiped it from<br/>\nmy memory. Got all A&#39;s without learning a thing, the least of which being<br/>\nhow to actually prepare for a deadline. When I started my career and was<br/>\nfaced with real deadlines, I hadn&#39;t a clue about how to work towards them. I<br/>\ntried to follow the same formula that had been successful for me in school,<br/>\nonly to find that in real life you can&#39;t procrastinate and then cram.<br/>\nUnfortunately, where I worked (Microsoft) I found that this was often the<br/>\ncase with people coming out of school. Smart kids only knew how to<br/>\nmanipulate the system, they had no idea how to actually prepare. It was a<br/>\ncontinual problem when I got into managing teams of people (as was<br/>\nmotivation, but that&#39;s another post :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unschoolers learning how to work to deadlines. Mine so far have<br/>\nlearned in two ways:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) They learn from planning for things that they want to accomplish. For<br/>\ninstance, my son (then 5) held several plant sales last summer. He wanted<br/>\nsome large Lego sets and decided to earn his own money. So he had to acquire<br/>\nsupplies, plant seeds, and take cuttings ahead of time so that they had<br/>\nplenty of time to grow into good sized plants to sell. Then before the sale,<br/>\nhe had to make signs, get money for change, decide on prices and put price<br/>\nstickers on the plants, and borrow a card table to display his wares. He had<br/>\nto get to the sale on time and set up. Of course, being as he&#39;s so young, I<br/>\nhelped with a lot of the logistics (driving, etc.) But he did a huge amount<br/>\nof the work/preparation himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) They learn from our example. My kids constantly see me working with<br/>\ndeadlines. I train/prepare for triathlons. I write articles, I schedule<br/>\nplaydates and homeschool activities and put together the supplies ahead of<br/>\ntime. Last week it was &quot;Homeschool Hogwarts&quot;, we had our &quot;Sorting Hat<br/>\nCeremony&quot;. So I had to gather the stuff I needed to bring, reserve the hall,<br/>\nmake the food, etc. Since unschooled kids are an integral part of the every<br/>\nday life of adults, they get an insider&#39;s view into how adults really do<br/>\nplan for deadlines. Whether it&#39;s packing for a camping trip, or editing my<br/>\nwriting, my kids see what I&#39;m doing and I&#39;m sure they learn from it (they<br/>\nalso learn from my mistakes, of course. Like the time I didn&#39;t print out my<br/>\ncamping list and therefore forgot important things like silverware).<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135098343,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;durrell@...&gt;","profile":"waptia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Deadlines","postDate":"1051131239","msgId":65646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFQTZGRDY3LjkwNTAzMDBAYWl0YWNjZXNzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNTExMjA5MDUuNTQ0Ny4zMzgyMi5tMTFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTExMjA5MDUuNTQ0Ny4zMzgyMi5tMTFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65644,"nextInTopic":65653,"prevInTime":65645,"nextInTime":65647,"topicId":65604,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Always has and with only one year to go, she will<br/>\nfinish. She has always hated deadlines in school. Always. No matter what it<br/>\nwas that she was &quot;supposed&quot; to have at a certain time, she never had it.<br/>\nHomework, projects, supplies to bring in from home, even permission slips to<br/>\ngo on trips. It was always last minute, a day later, or just never in. She<br/>\nsuffered the natural consequences of school but it made no difference at<br/>\nall. I tried then to ask, every day as to what she needed to have done. She<br/>\nwould &quot;forget&quot; to tell me. I would ask at school and that didn&#39;t work<br/>\neither. I finally just let her have her way and deal with it. She did. It<br/>\nwas never done on time!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell she&#39;s had a great job now since Nov. A job that pays very well here and<br/>\nshe loves it. She loves the job and the people and doesn&#39;t want to go<br/>\nelsewhere. She&#39;s never been later since she started. She works 5 days a week<br/>\nand still goes to school. I never had to remind her of the time. When she<br/>\nneeds to work early on the weekend, she&#39;s up all by herself. They have even<br/>\ncalled her last minute because they need her and she&#39;s there in a half an<br/>\nhour. She still has some days when she&#39;s late to school and some days when<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t go. She&#39;s never missed work or been late.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint to this story is that when kids are left to find their own interests,<br/>\nwhether that&#39;s school or not, they do what they need to do to make it work.<br/>\nSo being forced to meet deadlines doesn&#39;t work any better than not being<br/>\nmade to meet them.

With unschooling mine kids learn, are self motivated to give all they got to an activity. I have seen this happen. When they immerse in something they have perserverance and focus like I&#39;ve never seen or experienced myself. I think this comes from having unimpeded time and having the freedom to go their own directional interest. I think life provides us with the lesson of having to do things we don&#39;t like all the time. I don&#39;t think when they are little that we need to teach them this.When my people choose to do something they either accept the deadlines that come with it or they get creative and find an acceptable alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maureen<br/>\n<br/>\n  on-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

When a boss <br/>\nhands a worker an assignment, the worker may have little idea or input into <br/>\nwhere his work fits into the larger picture.  People who have a good grasp of <br/>\nhow their piece of the puzzle fits in can see deadlines, and can meet them <br/>\nmore easily, because the logic of them is obvious.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids set their own deadlines. Or, they have the freedom to seek <br/>\ninformation they need to see the logic in other people&#39;s deadlines.  If they <br/>\ndon&#39;t think the deadline is doable, they&#39;re more likely (IMO) to try and <br/>\nchange it or to ask the other people to consider other ideas.  If the <br/>\nhomeschooler&#39;s theater has it&#39;s performance set for May 10, and first <br/>\nrehearsal is April 1, an unschooler can see that it would be best to know <br/>\ntheir lines by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally wouldn&#39;t work at a job where I couldn&#39;t see or didn&#39;t have <br/>\naccess to the big picture.  I&#39;ve done plenty of grunt jobs, so it&#39;s not about <br/>\nbeing in charge.  I perform better when I have a complete grasp of it, and <br/>\nsome control over what my part is and how I get it done.  (&quot;Punished by <br/>\nRewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn has a good section on that.)   I can&#39;t see any of the <br/>\nunschooled kids I know going into a job without a secondary goal in mind...it <br/>\nbeing a means to an end (spending money, new car, tuition), or &quot;paying their <br/>\ndues&quot; in a field they love, or gaining experience to work for themselves.  <br/>\nUnschooling gave them that ability, because most of them have been operating <br/>\non that principle since they were little.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling makes better, happier workers.

Did you need to be &quot;trained&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nLIFE has deadlines; and as unschoolers, we deal with the &quot;natural <br/>\nconsequences&quot; of a normal life. I&#39;m putting on a conference. It can&#39;t happen <br/>\novernight. I have to do things incrementally over a year to get there. I&#39;m <br/>\ngardening. I have to shove things in the ground after frost and before the <br/>\nheat of SC sets in to grow anything---and tend them all summer to expect to <br/>\neat fresh tomatoes and cukes. I plan to have supper on the table each evening <br/>\n(or not! &lt;g&gt;). I&#39;m training a dog to be able to show by fall--the deadline is <br/>\nset because the shows are already planned. Pool&#39;s got to be acid washed <br/>\nbefore we can swim in it this spring; finshed that yesterday and am filling <br/>\nit with water now. I have David Albert coming in to speak Friday afternoon: I <br/>\nhave my &quot;to do&quot; lists (three or four of them!) bouncing around here so that I <br/>\ncan meet the deadline of the 4:00 talk. I have an MNO tonight---I need to <br/>\nhave more flyers for the Albert talks printed up to hand out by 6:30 this <br/>\nevening. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 15 year old son has his first job working in a deli. He is incredibly &quot;on <br/>\ntime&quot;, conscientious, and dependable. He didn&#39;t learn that by so many years <br/>\nin school writing papers and doing science projects. He&#39;s seen his parents be <br/>\n&quot;on time&quot;, conscientious, and dependable. He WANTS to be those things as <br/>\nwell. And so he is.     His passions are music and filming. Neither have <br/>\n&quot;deadlines&quot;. But he DID work really hard on a screenplay to have it finished <br/>\nin time for his friends to learn their lines in order to begin filming.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re creating artificial deadlines in order to TRAIN our children, we&#39;re <br/>\n&quot;playing&quot; with them (and I don&#39;t mean that in a good way!). There are natural <br/>\ndeadlines to be met in a normal everyday life. Children NATURALLY pick up on <br/>\nthings they want to do and steps they need to take to get there. The &quot;natural <br/>\nconsequence&quot; would be that it doesn&#39;t happen. If he wants to swim in the <br/>\nupcoming swim meet and he doesn&#39;t get his entry in by the deadline, he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get to swim---natural consequence of not meeting his deadline. If he <br/>\nwants to prepare an authentic Japanese supper, he&#39;ll need to start preparing <br/>\nearly enough to buy and cut up and cook in stages throughout the day <br/>\nor---natural consequence: his guests will get too hungry and go OUT for <br/>\nsupper! <br/>\n<br/>\nA child may need to be reminded that he needs to get that entry in by a <br/>\ncertain date or that he needs to get to the asian market before 2:00---but <br/>\nhe&#39;ll get to the point he can do it on his own. WE have no deadline to have <br/>\nour kids &quot;ready&quot; to be on their own, answering to some boss. There&#39;s no <br/>\nmagical age that he&#39;s got to be able to meet deadlines. And school&#39;s <br/>\nartificial project deadlines don&#39;t help with that.
