I struggle with being<br>online because my husband works on the \n    road and I never know when he is<br>going to call.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Oh \n    sure!&nbsp; I&#39;m fairly certain their web site is <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.callwave.com\">http://www.callwave.com</a>. <br>The software \n    is free and it&#39;s very small little window that sits on top<br>of all other \n    windows.&nbsp; It runs little ads but they aren&#39;t too intrusive.<br><br>You \n    have to have your phone set up with &quot;line busy forwarding&quot; \n    which<br>means that if the call encounters a busy signal it is forwarded to \n    their<br>800 number.&nbsp; They get a message that you are using Call Wave \n    and to leave<br>a message. (the main drawback is that they only get 30 \n    seconds). <br><br>On your computer you hear a single ring and once they&#39;ve \n    recorded the<br>message they play it for you on your computer.&nbsp; If it&#39;s \n    important I go<br>offline and call them back.&nbsp; The only problem I&#39;ve \n    experienced is that,<br>because I have call waiting, the computer doesn&#39;t \n    seem to always call out<br>on the right line and that means everyone gets \n    the busy signal.&nbsp; If I<br>reboot the computer it picks up the right \n    line and I have no idea why<br>this happens.<br><br>There is another service \n    which you can pay for and it has some really<br>nice features.&nbsp; It \n    includes caller ID and you can click on one of several<br>options like \n    &quot;I will call back later&quot; or &quot;Call me back in 5 minutes&quot; \n    and<br>they will give the caller your message.&nbsp; I think the name of \n    that one is<br>Pagoo, <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pagoo.com\">http://www.pagoo.com</a><br><br>If I find that \n    the web site is different than the one I gave I will post<br>again.&nbsp; \n    I&#39;m writing this on Juno and can&#39;t check the site right \n    now.<br><br>Kris<br>________________________________________________________________<br>GET \n    INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br>Juno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access \n    for less!<br>Join Juno today!&nbsp; For your FREE software, visit:<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/get/tagj\">http://dl.www.juno.com/get/tagj</a>.<br><br>------------------------ \n    Yahoo!
