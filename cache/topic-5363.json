It&#39;s about validating the feelings of the child.<br/>\nYou know, even the last phrase leaves sharing hovering there in the<br/>\nair for &quot;when she is ready&quot;, ruining a bit the joy of her play - of<br/>\nplay in the *moment*.  The joy - the moment - is robbed because soon, <br/>\nit will be all over and &#39;everyone is waiting&#39;.  Hurry up and get the <br/>\nfun in. The problem with sharing has been set up and sets the child <br/>\nup, no matter how you slice it, as having some sort of problem for <br/>\nwanting to do what it is she is choosing and wanting to do.  The <br/>\nunderlying tone is that the child is wrong for doing this.  She is not. <br/>\nContrary to popular belief, according to my obersvation of certain <br/>\nchildren, this respect for individuality does not set up nasty, greedy<br/>\nhoarding little creatures. It is wise to leave the sharing thing alone, <br/>\nvalidating feelings and backing off. It all comes together because<br/>\nof love and life and the joy of living.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo we say that we, too (adults), have trouble sharing?  And do we?<br/>\nWell, *why*?! And is it really the same &quot;set up&quot; for us as it is for <br/>\nthem (children)?  Not at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn closing some ideas from this and other posts:<br/>\nThere is no &quot;perfect&quot; mother - I think even striving to be one, <br/>\ntakes away from each unique *moment* - it is simply not the <br/>\ngoal to strive for in the best interests of a child or a mother. <br/>\nLooking into the child&#39;s eyes (a person&#39;s place) and putting <br/>\noneself in their point of view, puts so much into focus. It&#39;s not <br/>\nabout being the &quot;best&quot;, it&#39;s about living and growing - learning <br/>\nand giving. It&#39;s about children and respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane McBryan Alignan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thad Martin","from":"Thad Martin &lt;tmartin@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4_93GFIZXvhn-dstQdJTCL8anYhlY7Qo-ggWyxgu7f_eILuMyac9bNV0zJbWO09uziKnsAJsATuOQST7p6Y9BVZIX6oSJ0fO7O0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Speaking Up for Kids","postDate":"945682413","msgId":5364,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDYuNTM2NC45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5363,"nextInTopic":5370,"prevInTime":5363,"nextInTime":5365,"topicId":5363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi, some of my strongest memories from my childhood were isolated events like this, where someone i had very little or no knowledge of spoke with me.  it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-578669828\">hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nsome of my strongest memories from my childhood were isolated events like this,<br/>\nwhere someone i had very little or no knowledge of spoke with me.  it really left a<br/>\ndeep impression.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin.tx<br/>\n<br/>\nShay Seaborne wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Shay Seaborne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s-seaborne@...\">s-seaborne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Sun, 19 Dec 1999 15:58:29 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: McBryan Alignan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clairefree@...\">clairefree@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Why not speak up for the child?
