I have just been worried  that if we changed everything at once that it would be too much for me to cope with and it wouldn&#39;t last.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

The goal is at all times to give<br/>\nour children the greatest sense of ownership over their lives that<br/>\nwe can. In those instances where there is a need for parental<br/>\noversight (as in having had more experience with late nights or<br/>\nwith adult movie material) stepping in needs to be with clear,<br/>\neasy to understand reasons that the child has the chance to<br/>\nhear and respond to.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I hear stepping in, I think of something going on that we are not a<br/>\npart of and then making ourselves become a part of that situation and then<br/>\nleaving again. Like seeing a fight, stepping and stopping it and then<br/>\nleaving. So I like to think of it more like just being a part and always<br/>\nbeing there with our children to talk about whatever is going on. Not<br/>\nnecessarily being right on top of them but behind them or beside them to<br/>\nhelp and guide when needed. Always talking about what is going on, whether<br/>\nthere are problems or not makes it so that we don&#39;t just &quot;step in&quot; when<br/>\nthere is a problem. It&#39;s something we&#39;re always around for and our kids know<br/>\nthat and don&#39;t feel odd or shy or embarrassed to ask. I think that&#39;s what<br/>\nyou understood, just clarifying for myself and maybe others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Seems like we can go a long way in letting our kids discover<br/>\nwhat they can tolerate and then in those rare instances, we can<br/>\nsay &quot;Not tonight&quot; with a good explanation for why this is an<br/>\nexception.<br/>\nDoes that sound close?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. And when it&#39;s not arbitrary, then our children get it too because it&#39;s<br/>\nnot a &quot;because I said so&quot; which isn&#39;t fair at all to them. They start to<br/>\nhear what we are saying and why instead of just no all the time for no real<br/>\nreason.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Good to hear.

Then later we talk about them<br/>\nafter he&#39;s had time to digest them. Then I can give him my take on things<br/>\nand listen to his perspective and work on both ways and how we can leave<br/>\nparts out, include them and make them both better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Changes/struggles","postDate":"1054949976","msgId":72685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJicmZvbytnNmV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI4LjM5MjhhZDYyLjJjMTI4NDU1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72683,"nextInTopic":72688,"prevInTime":72684,"nextInTime":72686,"topicId":72553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... each other ... meetings or anything, ... things ... expectations about ... worry about ... without the ... about things, the ...

And if so, when and on what basis? Is there a<br/>\ndifference between restricting movies or music and bedtimes?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I think it depends on the family and the circumstances and also if it&#39;s<br/>\nnot just a rule because, that it has sound reasoning behind it, then it&#39;s<br/>\nokay. You mentioned bedtime. My oldest goes whenever she wants. She knows<br/>\nwhat she can handle with work and school and things planned. Sierra, at 7 is<br/>\nvery good at her self regulation. So I pretty much let her go. There are<br/>\ntimes when she&#39;s up until midnight and other times when she asks if she can<br/>\ngo to bed at 11:00. (what would I say.....no??) The 2 1/2 year old gets very<br/>\ncranky with not enough sleep or will fall asleep the next day late and<br/>\ntotally throw everything off kilter. So her bedtime if you will is anywhere<br/>\naround 11 until 12:00. No set time, we wing it. Joseph is not good yet at<br/>\nseeing his tired signs. I see them but he doesn&#39;t. He loves to stay up and<br/>\nwill go for a long time and the next day he&#39;s unbearable. I have let him go<br/>\nfor about a month and he doesn&#39;t regulate in that time. It&#39;s caused big<br/>\nproblems with how he relates to others. So as long as he gets some good<br/>\nsleep for a couple nights, going to bed when the baby does, I&#39;ll tell him<br/>\nwhen he asks to stay up that it&#39;s okay. He knows he can&#39;t do that every<br/>\nnight. He sees how he&#39;s grouchy the next day. That little bit of help I give<br/>\nhim, with good reasoning is helping him to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My dh brought up that driver&#39;s licenses are for 16 year olds and<br/>\nvoting is for 18 year olds.  As a society we recognize that younger<br/>\nchildren are less mature and need experience before being<br/>\ntrusted to in all areas. Does this apply to little kids and their<br/>\nviewing/sleeping habits too?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n We just went through the driving thing here. I personally don&#39;t think that<br/>\nhere where I live, most 15 year olds should be driving around. I should also<br/>\nsay that most 70 year olds shouldn&#39;t either. And I could lump in all the<br/>\nages in between!!! But it&#39;s the law here. 15 can get their restricted and<br/>\nmost of the parents of these children let them drive alone. It&#39;s easier for<br/>\nthem. Then after a year, literally on their 16th birthday they can get their<br/>\nlicense. I didn&#39;t see Tara being ready at 15 to drive. Luckily for me, she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t feeling ready or eager either. She got her restricted at almost 16.<br/>\nSlowly we started showing her and taking her out.

She&#39;s knowing her<br/>\nstrenghts and weaknesses and learning accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as TV and movies, we don&#39;t restrict. I have noticed that when<br/>\nsomething questionable comes on, the children either turn the channel or<br/>\ntell me that makes them uncomfortable and can I watch for it and let them<br/>\nknow if it happens again or if it&#39;s that kind of movie or show.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And what do you do if you and your spouse don&#39;t see it the same<br/>\nway?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am fortunate to have a husband pretty trusting of my parenting and what I<br/>\nhave learned and tried and looked into. Once in awhile, the old family<br/>\nmentality comes back and he gives a &quot;because I said so&quot; answer. We talk a<br/>\nlot about what he can do that&#39;s better. I have him read things or just read<br/>\nthings to him. Then talk some more so he sees what&#39;s really important and<br/>\nhow big of a deal could that be or let&#39;s just try and see what happens.

EVeryone seems to want to stay up later these days. Plus, I think <br/>\nour bodies are following a natural cycle, going with the sun a bit. I <br/>\nstill tend to get up pretty early, even with going to bed later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. We&#39;ve adopted a &quot;stay up alone night&quot; policy, where each kid <br/>\ngets to do just that, once in awhile. Nothing set, just...when a kid <br/>\nsays &quot;Can I stay up alone tonight?&quot; we often say &quot;sure.&quot; It&#39;s still <br/>\nour decision to say yes or no...and we do that based on how much <br/>\nsleep they&#39;ve gotten in recent weeks, whether we have to be up and <br/>\nout the next morning, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might find a way out of your kids asking to stay up later, if you <br/>\ngive them a &quot;stay up alone&quot; night once in awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe driving at age 16 thing. Out here in rural Idaho, kids drive much <br/>\nyounger than that, and farm children are eligible for a day license <br/>\nat age 14, but lots of them have already been driving for awhile by <br/>\nthat age. 16 is an arbitrary assignment of maturity. Some kids are <br/>\nnot ready to drive by 16, needing to mature more before having that <br/>\nresponsibility. Some kids are ready for it, younger. Not many, IMO. <br/>\nBut anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince parents have the responsibility of paying their Dr. bills, I <br/>\nthink parents have the right to determine some of these things for <br/>\nthe kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Changes/struggles","postDate":"1054907444","msgId":72553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJicTY3aytsYXU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72555,"prevInTime":72552,"nextInTime":72554,"topicId":72553,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Since January, we ve made some sweeping and radical changes in our family life, largely due to the influence of this group.
