It was as if he would have to put all<br/>\nhis energy into staying still and this would block the creative flow or<br/>\nsomething.  He only printed out messages on birthday cards.  He eventually<br/>\nstarted to used a keyboard,  but what kicked the writing thing in was when<br/>\nhe joined a creative writing circle with some other unschoolers who wanted<br/>\nto push themselves and share their writing.  They would do excercises, and<br/>\none day after having hastily scrawling his contribution but not being able<br/>\nto decipher his own letters, he came home and said he thought it was time to<br/>\nlearn to write cursive.  He finally had a reason.  We decided together that<br/>\nwe would take a half an hour a day for as long as it took.  He kept at it<br/>\nfor an hour the first day, and we worked again the next day for a shorter<br/>\ntime and that was it.

I love reading to them, so it&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; that.<br/>\n&gt; I guess its just that all the 6,7 yr olds I know can read, and write<br/>\n&gt; ect....  My son has no interest in learning to read or write.  He can<br/>\n&gt; barely write his name, and that&#39;s it.<br/>\n&gt; Am I just getting into  one of those &quot;crazy Mom&quot; times???<br/>\n&gt; I need some words..........<br/>\n&gt; Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Been there.  While we didn&#39;t attempt any actual learn to read programs, I<br/>\nwould try to get Neal to attempt to read the first sentence of every chapter<br/>\nor whatever.  He would deliberately read  words incorrectly that I *Knew*<br/>\nthat he knew.  It was just too much work, and he was losing the context<br/>\nwhile doing the decoding.  I would usually get the message and back off and<br/>\njust read to him.  Part of the problem was that we were also reading books<br/>\nlike the Narnia series and E. Nesbit books which had either difficult or<br/>\nrather anachronistic language for a 7 or 8 year old.  It&#39;s hard to puzzle<br/>\nout words you have never heard before.  OTOH, he was not at all interested<br/>\nin the easy read stuff which was more at his reading skill level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I backed off.  He started reading on his own just before his 10th<br/>\nbirthday and was reading high school level books and technical manuals<br/>\nwithin months.  He needed to wait until his cognitive readiness caught up to<br/>\nhis taste in reading material.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith son #2, I had learned my lesson, and didn&#39;t press him.  We just kept<br/>\nreading to him.  One day I had a bad cold and finally said that if he wanted<br/>\nto finish the chapter he would have to read to me.  He looked at the page<br/>\nfor awhile and then slowly and haltingly sounded out the whole first<br/>\nsentence!   I asked him why he hadn&#39;t told me he could read and he replied,<br/>\nwith great surprise &quot;I only just discovered it myself!&quot;  This was at about 7<br/>\nyears of age, and he too refused to read aloud or on his own until he was 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing is that while these kids both read late, their<br/>\ncomprehension is excellent.  I&#39;m convinced that  they could have decoded the<br/>\nwords earlier, but not without losing the context and this was<br/>\ncounter-productive to the whole purpose of reading, nu?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is reassuring to you, Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skeane@...\">skeane@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mypage.direct.ca/s/skeane/\">http://mypage.direct.ca/s/skeane/</a><br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nSummer Haiku<br/>\n<br/>\nSmell of glove leather,<br/>\ngrassy stains and diamond dust,<br/>\ngreen cathedrals......life.        -sk<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"KaeKaeB2@xxx.xxx","from":"KaeKaeB2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xikKOcqIHRM5_QqjFcbycX_Fl6WKX10nVHc9xGpReJ7oiXPXA9SYeSaiFdAgUD0F7tQfgzuEVw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Frustrating day!!","postDate":"928352291","msgId":144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNy4xNDQuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":141,"nextInTopic":145,"prevInTime":143,"nextInTime":145,"topicId":141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/2/99 2:14:52 PM Central Daylight Time, hooperck@teleplex.net writes:  Words we got.  :) It s not true","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-202734556\">In a message dated 6/2/99 2:14:52 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hooperck@...\">hooperck@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I need some words.......... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWords we got.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not true that all 6-7 year olds read. What they do is reading readiness. <br/>\n You know the goal that the President set out was all kids reading by the end <br/>\nof 3rd grade. What that really means is that by 10 most kids are reading, and <br/>\nsome of them are reading not even close to reading fluently.  I have a son <br/>\nwho is 9.5, he&#39;s only been reading 1st grade material fluently for 3 months <br/>\nor more.  I have another son who is 7. That poor child couldn&#39;t care one whit <br/>\nabout words and letters.  Give him a screwdriver and something to take apart <br/>\nand he&#39;s in heaven.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to consider is that not all learning is on a steady uphill <br/>\ncurve.  Learning is like physical growth, it comes in fits and starts.  <br/>\nSometimes there is a very long down time, sleep time, right before a spurt of <br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not worth tears. You can&#39;t make his brain comprehend until it&#39;s ready <br/>\nanyhow. Put the book up and just read to him.  Then get up and bake some <br/>\ncookies.  In 3 months it will dawn on you that he&#39;s reading much better, that <br/>\nhe has learned and he hasn&#39;t cried over 100 Easy lessons in 90 days.  When <br/>\nhe&#39;s ready, he&#39;ll ask, either directly or indirectly for more info about how <br/>\nreading works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI promise.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A.Y.","from":"&quot;A.Y.&quot; &lt;hooperck@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9WzU3uSaPpUrUi2iysMFyIe1lp6c1s-UcwwCLz8NYK69he9AOIWfLxnOVK4CBxS7TAywBRLxmWIHbfNMuBVfVuRZFeq3","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Frustrating day!!","postDate":"928351195","msgId":141,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNy4xNDEuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":144,"prevInTime":140,"nextInTime":142,"topicId":141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son (6) and I  have been doing How to teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons .
