I am","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1131040058\">Hello,<br/>\nMy name is Angie and I�m 20 years old and was homeschooled from the age of 8. Well I�m all grown up now and am thinking about the future.  I am lucky to have been (through homeschooling) surrounded by some WONDEFUL moms. I have learned so much from them about parenting. I love kids and I know that I�m going to have them someday so I like to learn all that I can about parenting while I�m still as young as I am. I have already decided on some �unconventional� ways of parenting. Such as, home birth, extended breast-feeding, attachment parenting, family bed, unschooling (of course) and now I am learning about circumcision. It is so funny that this came up on the list right now because it�s something that I have been researching for the past few weeks. I have definitely decided that I�m not going to do it. I recently wrote an email to a list called <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:circumcision@yahoogroups.com\">circumcision@yahoogroups.com</a> and got some GREAT responses about some concerns I had. The biggest being is how I will handle it when my extended family finds out. But it�s just one more thing that I�m going to have to deal with. I know that I will have problems anyway with the other things I�ve decided on. I�m just going to have to stick up for myself and not back down. Well, I wrote more than I wanted to. I just thought you guys might want to read my email that I posted (below) to the list and I have some great web sites too!  But I just want to let you know that I have learned a lot sense I wrote this and I don&#39;t think it was a very big desision. Now that I know what I know, there is just NO WAY!!  :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Angie<br/>\n<br/>\nHello, my name is Angie and I&#39;m 20 years old. I am not a mom yet but I will <br/>\nbe some day. I am friends with a lot of moms who say it&#39;s wrong to circumcise <br/>\nyour child. I agree for a great deal of reasons. First of all I think it <br/>\nshould be my (future) son&#39;s choice whether or not it should be done to him. <br/>\nAlso I think that that&#39;s the way god made him so why mess with it? And the <br/>\nbiggest reason is that I can&#39;t even imagine letting someone cut a piece of my <br/>\nchild off. So I have a lot of good reasons. However, I know that when the <br/>\ntime comes that I do have kids I know it will be a family problem. My mother <br/>\nwill support me in whatever I do, it&#39;s the men in the family and my <br/>\ngrandparents who will have the biggest problem with it. But I know that I <br/>\ncan&#39;t do something like circumcise my son just because they will be mad. What <br/>\nI would really like is to read all the info I can get on the subject. The <br/>\npros and cons, medical facts. I would also really like to hear what a man <br/>\nthinks of the subject. I just really want to make sure that I&#39;m doing the <br/>\nright thing. This is such a big decision that I want to be prepared by <br/>\nlearning all that I can now so that I have no doubts later on. Thank you so <br/>\nmuch for taking the time to read this e-mail. I would greatly appreciate some <br/>\nhelp with my research so any info you can give me would be great.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Angie<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cirp.org/\">http://www.cirp.org/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.norm.org/\">http://www.norm.org/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nocirc.org/\">http://www.nocirc.org/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.noharmm.org/\">http://www.noharmm.org/</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cirp.org/nrc/\">http://www.cirp.org/nrc/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sicsociety.org/\">http://www.sicsociety.org/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.circumcision.org/\">http://www.circumcision.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.MotherFriendly.org/\">http://www.MotherFriendly.org/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.MothersAgainstCirc.org/\">http://www.MothersAgainstCirc.org/</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.UncutEntertainment.org/\">http://www.UncutEntertainment.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.SexAsNatureIntendedIt.com/\">http://www.SexAsNatureIntendedIt.com/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.StopInfantCircumcision.org/\">http://www.StopInfantCircumcision.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.SexuallyMutilatedChild.org/\">http://www.SexuallyMutilatedChild.org/</a>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/\">http://faculty.washington.edu/gcd/DOC/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/lewis1/\">http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/lewis1/</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/\">http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/\">http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.SexuallyMutilatedChild.org/firstluv.htm\">http://www.SexuallyMutilatedChild.org/firstluv.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
