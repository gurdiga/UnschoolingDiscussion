It was one John Holt really enjoyed and recommended.  I can even remember when GWS  was offering $3 for used copies to recycle back to readers when new ones no longer available.  Oh, for the days.....<br/>\n<br/>\nNot just the unschooling.  Was window for me into an entirely different culture.  I admit I was a bit shocked at first about a family living in a castle and having a Rolls while on the brink of bankruptcy but 20 years have mellowed me :-). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, if you see it in a garage sale snap it up. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if ANYONE ever sees a book called &quot;The Children on the Hill&quot; let me know and *I* will buy it!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki<br/>\n  Has anyone read the book called: and the children played by Patricia Joudry? It was published in 1975 but her children were unschoolers in the mid 50&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88752706,"authorName":"Carol Koessel","from":"&quot;Carol Koessel&quot; &lt;carolkoessel@...&gt;","profile":"carosel95542","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unschoolers now adults....not such a new concept.","postDate":"1022802013","msgId":37932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE9FMjBLY3pVaHl4OXc4T2pVOWYwMDAwODg3ZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37946,"prevInTime":37931,"nextInTime":37933,"topicId":37932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Has anyone read the book called: and the children played by Patricia Joudry?

It was published in 1975 but her children were unschoolers in the mid 50&#39;s. It is a riot of a book and a crazy, fun, loving adventure of unschooling. It is however out of print and I haven&#39;t seen it on used sites for less than $45. for a book that once sold for $6.95. If you ever come across it grab it up, it is a delightful book. So, I guess people were unschooling way back when...Carol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37930,"nextTopicId":37947}}
