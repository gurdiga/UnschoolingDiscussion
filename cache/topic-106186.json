I lost &quot;my&quot; welfare, and<br/>\nam living partly on &quot;his&quot; and partly on my PT work, as<br/>\nI chose not to try to &quot;work&quot; any longer with the<br/>\n&quot;welfare to work&quot; social &quot;workers&quot; (lol)as I  could<br/>\nnot homeschool and work according to their rules and<br/>\nconstant harassment.  It was clear to me that he<br/>\nreally needed the TIME WITH ME, after his crisis with<br/>\nand in public school, (as well as with circumstances<br/>\nbeyond my control during his infancy and toddlerhood)<br/>\nand that nothing else would help him heal and grow.<br/>\nand he needed the time alone with me, not with the<br/>\nother daycare kids. and he needed me to not be anxious<br/>\nabout anything, so I decided to accept &quot;his&quot; welfare<br/>\ngrant until is 18. I&#39;m glad I made these choices, as<br/>\nhe is much happier and growing more curious and<br/>\nconfident every day. (he was suicidal, vandalizing,<br/>\nacting out big time in public school 2 years ago.)<br/>\nI also live in section 8 housing, which I plan to give<br/>\nor loan to him if he wants it any time, so that he<br/>\nalso will be able to work part time and still survive<br/>\nin our rather expensive area.<br/>\nI plan to buy a van and hit the road for at least part<br/>\nof every year as soon as he is really ready for me to<br/>\ndo so. I have no idea when that will be.<br/>\nAnna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
