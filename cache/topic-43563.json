I always benefited from<br/>\nreading them. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a couple of those, and it WAS helpful.  Because knowing child <br/>\ndevelopment from the overall, summary level is fine, but to see a BUNCH of <br/>\ntraits and liklihoods and &quot;normalcies&quot; all put in one place helped remind me <br/>\nthat it&#39;s the whole large package of what Piaget and Maslow and Freud and <br/>\nJung and ALL those guys predicted or observed or measured all poured into one <br/>\nforty-pound package sometimes that makes the squirmy reality not look like <br/>\nthe text book.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were first ever going to be around younger kids I would remind <br/>\nthem what that kid could or couldn&#39;t or might like to do, what would be too <br/>\nmuch, what would be dangerous.   Once we went to a barbecue where we knew <br/>\nonly one other person.  There was an autistic boy, about eight years old.  <br/>\nKirby and Marty were about six and nine.   They asked me quietly what was <br/>\nwrong with that boy, because he wasn&#39;t playing with them the way they <br/>\nexpected him to.  I told them he had a condition that made him afraid of some <br/>\nthings, and if they played with him more like they play with Holly it would <br/>\nprobably work better.    It wasn&#39;t the most perfect of explanations, but they <br/>\nwere little, and said &quot;Okay!&quot; and zipped back out to the swings and the big <br/>\nyard.  Holly was three.  That was the day she got the 18-or-so mosquito bites <br/>\nwhich got badly infected and we figured out she should NOT play near the Rio <br/>\nGrande in the summer for a few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they played with him and didn&#39;t get grumpy when he wouldn&#39;t give the <br/>\nplayground ball back, and they didn&#39;t swing so high when he yelled &quot;Too HIGH <br/>\ntoo HIGH&quot; even though it was them swinging and not him, because they were <br/>\nused to being nice to Holly and other little kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were leaving, his mom followed me out of the house and out of the y<br/>\nard, to tell me with tears in her eyes that my boys had played with her son <br/>\nnicer than anyone ever had before.  I told her they had never been to school, <br/>\nso they were fine with people being different.  She was really kind of <br/>\noverwhelmed, emotionally, by how well the afternoon had gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and most of the women there were special ed teachers in the public <br/>\nschools.  I had never said, in their conversations, that I had taught, nor <br/>\nsaid anything about homeschooling.  I just let them go on and on and I went <br/>\nout and helped with food and the kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere had been a big toad in the yard,  and I caught it so the kids could see <br/>\nit and touch it.  One of the moms started shrieking (not quite screaming, but <br/>\nnot just yelling) that it might be POISONOUS!!!   She had an east-coast <br/>\naccent, and I grew up by the Rio Grande, and so she didn&#39;t slow me down a <br/>\nbit, and I reassured her calmly that they are not poisonous.  All the kids <br/>\ngot to hold it, feel its feet, touch its belly, look at its eyes, feel its <br/>\nheart beat, and we let it into the orchard toward the river.  I told the kids <br/>\nthey don&#39;t swim, but they like to be near the muddy places to eat the bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a group of people I was interested in socializing any further, but <br/>\nmy kids did make a good impression on them, and probably changed the view of <br/>\nhomeschoolers for half a dozen teachers for life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the point? LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  The autistic child wouldn&#39;t have been in the normal range for his age in <br/>\nthe &quot;your seven year old&quot; books, but because my kids were aware that there <br/>\nare some things younger kids are still not good at and they were able to <br/>\ntreat him as being at an earlier developmental stage, it worked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: sibling, squabbles, impulse control","postDate":"1031668756","msgId":43586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2NS4xMzIzMGMwOS4yYWFmNWUxNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43567,"nextInTopic":43594,"prevInTime":43585,"nextInTime":43587,"topicId":43563,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/10/02 2:16:14 AM, warblwarbl@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-64804056\">In a message dated 9/10/02 2:16:14 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warblwarbl@...\">warblwarbl@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I can&#39;t remember who said it, but I really appreciate the suggestion that <br/>\nit&#39;s more calming to sit down and do with them whatever project is going on <br/>\nthan to just give it to them and run off.
