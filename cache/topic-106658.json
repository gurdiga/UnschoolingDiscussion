Because they are caricatures.  They are samples  created <br/>\nto &quot;prove&quot; a point that hasn&#39;t been really tested.

It&#39;s just a way to make kids &quot;hungry&quot;  <br/>\nenough that you can bribe them with slight privileges and cheap gifts in order  <br/>\nto control them.   When a kid knows parents could tet them more toys  or <br/>\nclothes and the parents just don&#39;t, that does NOT make children  grateful.  When <br/>\nthey have to do chores because the parents are using them  as unpaid (or even <br/>\nkid-wage) labor, that doesn&#39;t make them grateful.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have watched my whole life to see if the &quot;spoiled&quot; stuff worked.  My  mom <br/>\nused to say my best friend was &quot;spoiled,&quot; but she wasn&#39;t.  It was just  a <br/>\ngratuitous insult because her parents had money and a really nice house.   My mom <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want me to want to have Martha&#39;s life, so she said bad things  about <br/>\nMartha.  Martha was nice and generous and never &quot;acted rich&quot; or acted  smart <br/>\nabout her privileges.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard other families say that about my kids, that they were &quot;spoiled&quot;  <br/>\nbecause they didn&#39;t have to take constant orders from their parents, or sit <br/>\nnext  to their parents in public places.  They wanted their kids to be satisfied  <br/>\nwith being told exactly what to do and where and how to sit, instead of <br/>\nwanting  to run around and look at things in the building as Kirby and Marty were <br/>\ndoing,  so they said &quot;you don&#39;t want to be spoiled like they are; they&#39;ll grow <br/>\nup  unhappy; they&#39;ll never get a job.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my kids were little we had a next-door neighbor who used to come over  <br/>\nand play every day or so.  We had a Xerox box full of fast-food toys.   He saw <br/>\nthat and his eyes got big and he asked if they could play with  them.  He was <br/>\nclearly excited, but then his eyes got veiled and he came  back to himself <br/>\n(the self his mom was creating) and said &quot;I don&#39;t save my toys  like this, <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m not spoiled&quot; or something.  He was no longer as  happy to see them, <br/>\nbecause it proved my kids were spoiled (in the universe being  created of guilt <br/>\nand parental messages in his head).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe daughter of our most vocal critic came to Marty&#39;s pirate birthday party  <br/>\nwhen he was four or five.  We had a buried treasure with a map, and she  being <br/>\none of the oldest (nine, probably) was the chief navigator and figured out  <br/>\nhow to read the map, and they dug up the treasure, which was an ammo box with  <br/>\nbags of candy and gold coins and a few hundred pennies.  (I saw that ammo  box <br/>\nthe other day, with the screen-printed pirate flag glued to it--I had  <br/>\nscreenprinted a bunch of napkins and decorations, and made little flags, and one  <br/>\nwas glued flat on that box; still is.)
