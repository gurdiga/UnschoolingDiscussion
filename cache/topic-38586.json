I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1859851741\">I&#39;m new at posting to this site, so I hope mercy will be in order. Tia, I <br/>\nwant to offer you support. I agree with your philosophy of personal <br/>\nresponsibility. I love my family and would die for them in an instant if it <br/>\nwere necessary. I also believe in personal responsibility, even in children. <br/>\nWe do our chores together as a family team, but if I have asked time and <br/>\nagain that something be done and it is not, I am not adverse to allowing a <br/>\nlittle natural consequence to come into play. This is not because I am some <br/>\ncontrol freak or unloving, unenlightened mom, but because the real world does <br/>\nrequire some modicum of self-control and responsibility and my children can <br/>\nbegin to learn that here in the loving forgiving realm of our home. Don&#39;t let <br/>\nanyone feel you are not being a good mom because of your methods. There are <br/>\nmany great ways to parent, not just one. :-)  Nat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37910,"nextTopicId":79716}}
