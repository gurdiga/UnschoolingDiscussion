The<br/>\nstudents range in age from 6 to 52.  ( no age requirements )  Usually one<br/>\nor two of the higher ranking students help, either leading the exercise<br/>\nwhile the instructor gives someone personal attention, or giving that<br/>\npersonal attention themselves. ( Highest rank is green belt )  There are<br/>\nsome times when the little kids would rather roll around on the floor and<br/>\nthe instructor just over looks it.  He tries to grab their attention, but<br/>\nif he can&#39;t,  he just reminds them to be quiet if they become disruptive.<br/>\n Typically one of the other students will engage the little ones in some<br/>\nactivity (often another beginner, but older ) <br/>\nlike practicing counting in Japanese, or break falls or something and<br/>\nafter a little while they&#39;re usually interested in joining the class<br/>\nagain.  Everyone just sort of understands this is how it is, and the<br/>\nolder people really love these little kids.  <br/>\nKids who really aren&#39;t interested in being there don&#39;t last that long,<br/>\nparents tend to catch on that their kids could be rolling around at home<br/>\nfor free.  <br/>\nYou said your style is hard and you are faithful to it, so maybe this<br/>\napproach wouldn&#39;t work for you.  It may sound like this isn&#39;t a very<br/>\ndisciplined class, but really it is.  There is just a kind of freedom<br/>\nwithin it for students to help each other.  <br/>\nI personally think this works beautifully.  Older students who are<br/>\nstruggling with some new technique can look at the little kids having fun<br/>\nand say,  &quot;Ok,  I don&#39;t need to stress about this, if he/she can do it so<br/>\ncan I.&quot;   And little kids can see an adult struggling with the same thing<br/>\nand realize it&#39;s hard for everyone, not just kids, and it builds<br/>\nconfidence.<br/>\nAn added bonus is everyone really loves this teacher and he gets lots of<br/>\nbirthday and Christmas presents.  = )    (I know you&#39;re not trying to win<br/>\na popularity contest, just my lame attempt at humor)<br/>\nMaybe with your students, class size or style this wouldn&#39;t work, but it<br/>\nworks here and everyone seems to be happy with it.  <br/>\nI think it&#39;s wonderful that you share what you know and love with these<br/>\nkids. I can&#39;t tell you how much it means to us that we found a class in<br/>\nour little town, someone willing to give their knowledge and time to the<br/>\nkids here.  <br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_dRuQCzPb3gLBi0H_8oVNmwzd4l1KposrI2FU-FeVN-sbcLy-Tu9vfF78XfSlr6Eox63z4DcULxy","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] age requirements","postDate":"1001542918","msgId":26285,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZi41MTc5Y2RiLjI4ZTNhZjA2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26281,"nextInTopic":26305,"prevInTime":26284,"nextInTime":26286,"topicId":26275,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/26/01 3:52:31 PM Mountain Daylight Time, ...

Or, conversely, what if you ended up with a 9 yr old who wasn&#39;t very<br/>\nstrong, had rotten balance, and got distracted easily?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think generalities are fine - &quot;This class is generally best-suited to X<br/>\nto Y year olds, because it requires skills A, B, and C.&quot; I think<br/>\ngeneralities will apply to many kids, but not all of them. Cacie is in<br/>\ntwo dramam classes now, one for 8-10 yr olds and one for 6-9 yr olds.<br/>\nShe&#39;s 8...and the 6-9 yr old class isn&#39;t a good fit, because most of the<br/>\nkids are a lot less focused than she is, and she gets frustrated a lot<br/>\nbecause of it. The 8-10 yr old class, though, is much better. I really<br/>\nthink she&#39;d fit into the next class up from the 6-9 yr old one, which is<br/>\nfor 10-12 yr olds (this is singing-dance-acting, whereas the 8-10 one is<br/>\nstraight acting). Unfortunately, it meets on Saturday mornings (why do so<br/>\nmany things happen on Saturday mornings), and the soccer season has just<br/>\nbegun, with games every Saturday.
