I, personally, think that this date should be celebrated, <br/>\nas well as the birth date.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, January 10, 2002, at 05:03 PM, Sarah Carothers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Present day<br/>\n&gt; present day<br/>\n&gt; present day<br/>\n&gt; I will not refer to my date of delivery as my b&#39;day.
