We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he knows<br/>\nall the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more confused<br/>\nby this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>\nfeelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH would<br/>\nrather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and that we<br/>\nhave agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>\nthing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I just<br/>\nwanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he may<br/>\nhave in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire process<br/>\nhas been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant without a<br/>\nmedical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>\njoint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>\nfeeding? I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that this<br/>\nwould now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in our<br/>\nhome.<br/>\nThank you for all your opinions-<br/>\nRon and Stephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7696,"nextTopicId":7906}}
