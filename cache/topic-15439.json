We don&#39;t watch TV (moved it to the<br/>\nbasement where hubby occasionally uses it to view sports), and don&#39;t own any<br/>\nplaystations or video games. My kids have their own computer and an<br/>\nassortment of programs and I don&#39;t put any time limits on that, but we do<br/>\nhave a general rhythm to our day where the time is semi-limited anyways<br/>\nbecause of other activities (we get up,  have breakfast, do chores, then<br/>\ncircle time, then we&#39;re usually out of the house until my daughter&#39;s nap<br/>\ntime, which is usually when my son and I do things he&#39;s wanted to do like<br/>\ncrafts or games, and then sometimes he uses the computer while I&#39;m getting<br/>\nher down or up from her nap, then it&#39;s in to dinner time and daddy&#39;s home<br/>\nand we do family stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I truly believe in unschooling - that is, letting our kids<br/>\ndirect their own learning. But I also believe that I do need to set some<br/>\nlimits in our children&#39;s lives and in our home. We don&#39;t have a ton, but we<br/>\ndo have some. Chores need to be done, food eaten needs to be fairly balanced<br/>\nand nutritious, and we don&#39;t play games (computer or otherwise) that involve<br/>\nshooting guns, or taking of life (we&#39;re also vegetarian and pacifist). My<br/>\nson was fairly appalled at the store today when we walked past a video game<br/>\ncalled &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; complete with fake gun you could aim at Bambi and blast<br/>\naway. We try to discuss our reasons for not spending a ton of money on<br/>\nconsumer goods as well - that each thing we buy has to be manufactured and<br/>\ntrucked and then disposed of when its no longer working. So in general we<br/>\ndon&#39;t buy much in the way of new toys/books/clothes, but try to find thrift<br/>\nstore stuff or make our own. We tend not to go into stores very often where<br/>\nwe will have to walk past big displays of mass-marketed goods and electronic<br/>\ndevices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure this will all get much more complicated as my kids get older<br/>\n(They&#39;re 4.5 and 16 months now) and they have their own money, etc. At that<br/>\npoint, I hope that the values we&#39;ve discussed so far rub off. Between now<br/>\nand then, we&#39;ll have to do a lot of thinking about what we do and do not<br/>\nwant to let into our household and lives, how much control we have or want<br/>\nto exert over this with respect to our kids, etc. etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) who spent hours adoring the fruit bats at the zoo<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who loves &quot;paghetti&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15456,"nextTopicId":15448}}
