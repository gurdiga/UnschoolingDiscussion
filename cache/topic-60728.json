I worked with another English teacher named <br/>\nMiss Pfiester.  &quot;Feester.&quot;  I kid you not.

If a boy hit puberty and got <br/>\ntall and hairy, she wanted him OUT of her room.  I kinda liked them at that <br/>\ngawky age, personally, and had no fear.  I used to trade her.  If someone <br/>\nreally didn&#39;t like my class and would rather go to hers where they just did <br/>\nwhat the book said, copy this exercise with the proper verb form, circle the <br/>\nnouns, stuff like that, they&#39;d go.  I&#39;d trade her a girl or a still-childlike <br/>\nboy for her bigger hairier boys.  And often the boy was happy to be in my <br/>\nmore busy, less predictable classroom because part of his problem was needing <br/>\nto move and twitch and look out the window.  No problem for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoys ideally DO get bigger and they become men.

Our <br/>\nkids have grown up together and we have taken vacations together etc. <br/>\nSuddenly, since our son turned 13, they have decided that he is a <br/>\nteenager, so their kids are no longer able to spend the night at our <br/>\nhouse as there is no telling what our son might do to them. The <br/>\nfather in this family has memories of doing some things at this age <br/>\nlike trying to sneak and see his sister naked, pressuring his sisters <br/>\nfriends to &quot;do stuff&quot;, etc. and thinks our son will do things like <br/>\nthat too. My husband says it never occurred to him to do anything <br/>\nlike that when he was 13, or ever for that matter, and I have 2 <br/>\nbrothers that say they never did anything like that either. My son is <br/>\na very kind, quiet, decent guy, and we are deeply offended that <br/>\nanyone would think him capable of such a thing. He feels condemned by <br/>\nthese people, and we have to see them everyday, right in front of us. <br/>\nIt is making me feel so ill that they look at my child with such <br/>\ncontempt, just because he became a teenager. This may have something <br/>\nto do with the fact that they have gone extreme &#39;Christian Right&#39; in <br/>\nthe last few years, and now think that they are above others in the <br/>\nneighborhood. It doesn&#39;t concern me what their beliefs are, and we <br/>\nhave looked on with great amusement at their hipocracy, and the <br/>\nthings they justify in the name of G_ _. I just never thought that it <br/>\nwould come to haunt my family. The problem is, as much as I would <br/>\nlike to write them off, our children still want to be friends. Their <br/>\nchildren want to be at our house all the time. I fear them. Who knows <br/>\nwhat ridiculous assertion they will apply to my family next? I can&#39;t <br/>\neven look at them (the parents)without becoming angry. I am losing <br/>\nsleep over this. Any suggestions on how to not let these people <br/>\npoison our life?
