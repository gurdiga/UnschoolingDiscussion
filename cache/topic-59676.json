Yea, in<br/>\nschool, maybe it would have been more fun than a lot of the things we did.<br/>\nBut if you&#39;re not in the mood to read, is sitting quietly, staring at a book<br/>\nto make a teacher happy, while feeling surly inside REALLY going to help a<br/>\nchild&#39;s love of reading?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t love &quot;sustained silent reading&quot; either.  But I loathed some of<br/>\nthe things we read in Lit class.  (Yes, Joseph Conrad, I&#39;m talking to<br/>\nyou!)  So, seeing educators believe that kids should get to pick what<br/>\nthey read is a tiny step in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously we can do better &quot;sustained silent reading&quot; in our homes, as<br/>\nwell as &quot;sustained loud reading&quot; and &quot;interrupted loud reading&quot; and all<br/>\nthe other kinds of reading. &lt;g&gt;  And when we&#39;re not reading, we&#39;re still<br/>\nlearning and having a good time.  I think unschooling is better, cooler<br/>\nAND more fun than any school program.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I was also happy to read a couple of &quot;official&quot; books about<br/>\nreading programs that said, essentially, if you WANT kids to read<br/>\nenthusiastically, for god&#39;s sake DON&#39;T make them do book reports.  This<br/>\nstrikes me as a valuable insight.  It&#39;s funny to see how much the school<br/>\nestablishment fights against it and wants to keep it&#39;s hallowed book<br/>\nreports, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really pretty off topic here, so I think I should stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59674,"nextTopicId":59683}}
