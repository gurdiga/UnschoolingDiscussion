Even so, the reason is just that their dad thinks tv<br/>\nduring the day is a waste of time when they should be working on<br/>\nsomething, and I don&#39;t agree with his mindset at all.

Especially the shows that made me mad.  So, if my kids liked those<br/>\nshows, they would watch behind my back.  Problem solved.=}<br/>\nOn a serious note, here are some things we did.  First, I accepted that I<br/>\ncould not change that they were going to watch things I did not want them<br/>\nto.  Second, I quit enforcing rules.  Third, we all sat down and talked<br/>\nabout how we felt and what we all wanted.  As a family we agreed for the<br/>\nkids to watch tv or videos only after 3pm on Mondays, Thursdays and<br/>\nFridays, but all day on the other days if they wanted.  (I won&#39;t go into<br/>\nthe reasons why I thought they were watching too much during the earlier<br/>\npart of the day.)  We wrote it all down in a book and signed it. <br/>\nFinally, if something comes on tv that I dislike, I say so and why and it<br/>\nusually starts a discussion.<br/>\nI think if I had a problem with my son watching too much, I would talk<br/>\nwith him to find out what his reasons are, what the thinking is behind<br/>\nthe behavior.  Then I would accept his reasoning as valid.  That in<br/>\nitself might open up all sorts of possible solutions.  If it bothers you,<br/>\nI would give information that describes why you think the behavior is<br/>\nnegative, and describe your feelings as to how the behavior affects you. <br/>\nThen you could ask him to help you find a mutually agreeable solution. <br/>\nAnother thing you can do is, when he is watching a show, mention an<br/>\nalternative thing that is available after the show.  That way he has time<br/>\nto think about it and choose to do it in his own time.  I have a son who<br/>\nfixates on things and the only way I can get through to him is if when I<br/>\ninterrupt him I say, &quot;Can I have five minutes of your time?&quot;   If after<br/>\ntalking, you still can&#39;t agree, then maybe acceptance is the answer.  <br/>\nBonni<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Rachel Wolfe Ravenhart","from":"Rachel Wolfe Ravenhart &lt;ravenhart@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Y2oTDZ3OWtdgcCRghZXxC1_7YGkhKBfjH56HOch5nh1bch6AUril0bsKtmyMlBSF84ccFOAR8c6WL0qH3yi9lrLQidzFQpN5EKZbl8Kf-lD1dw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Television","postDate":"1000336155","msgId":25494,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCOUZFQjFCLjIxNkE5OTU1QGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTEyLjEwMDA1OS4tNjYwMTUuMC5ic29sbGFyc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":25428,"nextInTopic":34522,"prevInTime":25493,"nextInTime":25495,"topicId":24146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for all the responses, flox.

That way I can use it as a<br/>\nspringboard for conversation.  But one time my kids were watching the<br/>\nSimpsons, I was in the room, and this man exploded, really violent and<br/>\nbloody and degrading, and all my kids made a collective gasp, and turned<br/>\nit off and discussed why it was wrong together.  I said a few things<br/>\nabout it, but realized that they were figuring all this out on their own.<br/>\n I really respect them and admire them for that.  I have not noticed them<br/>\nwanting to watch the Simpsons since then.  They like the humor, but did<br/>\nnot find that funny.  The way I see it is, if I control my children&#39;s<br/>\ntelevision when I&#39;m there then when I&#39;m not they will just watch what<br/>\nthey want anyway, so it is better to let them set their boundaries now<br/>\nrather than try and do it when they&#39;re adults on their own with no<br/>\nknowledge of how to set their own boundaries.  Of course, even such a<br/>\nsick display can be a springboard of, what kind of message is the<br/>\nproducer of this show sending, except to say, hey, this is funny because<br/>\nwe are mocking American culture which revels in blood and gore in film. <br/>\nThe only thing I said was, The reason I don&#39;t like watching the Simpsons<br/>\nis because it is unpredictable, and you never know when they&#39;re going to<br/>\nshow something like this, and also because it is a cartoon with people<br/>\nwith baby-like facial features which  attracts children&#39;s attention, but<br/>\nwith adult-style sarcasm.  In the past, the kids would change the channel<br/>\nwhen the Itchy and Scratchy show was coming on, which they also figured<br/>\nout on their own that they didn&#39;t want to see.  Years ago, I refused to<br/>\nlet them watch the Simpsons, but my husband would watch it, so they would<br/>\ntoo.  But now it is on daily on Fox.  I have relaxed a lot when it comes<br/>\nto television, as on many things over the years that I once believed<br/>\nstrongly I should control, simply because I found myself in a losing<br/>\nbattle.  But now I am seeing this as a blessing, because it freed up my<br/>\nfamily to make more choices and matured me into a less controlling<br/>\nperson.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"NeHe5xRlRE6LtAnmHthL3aTxI8WGcekdBp-759_Rmtjbj-bu_T_pHSd_aLMpqG4QSE9TBMtFJ7KEs9Y8mtldLyIKYiFid-sauA5eZT-r","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Television","postDate":"999697272","msgId":24146,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBHSjYwMElBVlpEMFFaQG10YTYuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25428,"prevInTime":24145,"nextInTime":24147,"topicId":24146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And some of you thought shouting or guns were controversial.  ...
