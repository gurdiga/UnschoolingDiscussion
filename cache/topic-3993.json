I cut and pasted the letter I sent out to everyone on my list<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oct.12,1999. You may eventually get it forwarded to you from whoever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sent you the original email about Kelsey missing, but you are the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recent emails I have received and I&#39;d like to speed up the process of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving you the update. Thank you all so much for caring!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hello Everyone!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am taking this time to say first THANK YOU ALL SO<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH!!! For your concern, all your prayers, and forwarding the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; message<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about Kelsey onto everyone. I have received unbelievable amounts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; email from people all over. There are truly many wonderful and caring<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people out there! Let me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell you the wonderful news, today the police brought me my baby<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In truth, God brought her back safely to me. I believe in the power<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prayer and I appreciate the hundreds of prayers that all of you said<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kelsey. She was taken from the public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; library yesterday while her preschool class was visiting it. She is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unharmed and as happy to be home as we are to have her. The man who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; took<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her was a stranger and I feel extremely fortunate to have her back as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all know the outcome of many of these situations, for those of you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are parents I&#39;m sure you can imagine all the different thoughts that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ran<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through my head during her absence. I know it had to be the worst<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; night<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have ever experienced in my life. I pray for all those parents out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there that are still missing their children and I ask you to do the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same. The man that took her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was mentally handicapped and living on his own. He apparently meant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no harm and did not understand the seriousness of his actions, he is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently being held and evaluated. It is a tough situation to deal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with. I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to answer as many individual emails as I could, especially from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those of you who are friends or acquaintances of mine. I apologize if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; miss anyone. The vast amount of mail makes it nearly impossible. I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attaching a site and form that one wonderful stranger passed onto me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is for missing children. I hope you will pass it onto anyone you know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a missing child and even just save the page somewhere for future<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use. I hope no one needs it, but it is a wonderful site for those who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do. So please pass this GREAT news and MY MANY<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MANY THANKS onto everyone you forwarded my message to. Thank you all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much once again!
