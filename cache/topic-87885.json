I know Jackson (for this state and for his <br/>\nFP certification) he must complete 150 CME credits ( I believe that is the <br/>\nnumber) per year.  Those credits can be seminars and conferences attended but <br/>\nalso medical or hospital meetings, medical journals, meetings with mentors and <br/>\nexperts in other medical specialties etc.  All count toward those credits.  Your <br/>\nlearning is varied, and does not stop once you receive your MD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso to specialize at all you need to go through residency which is very <br/>\nlittle of what is considered &quot;traditional book work&quot; it is almost all mentoring, <br/>\ngroup work, on the job training with a specialist, etc.  Yes, you need to <br/>\nattend college, and yes, you do need to pass a couple of board exams but that is <br/>\nnot the end of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it isn&#39;t a story about a doctor who never attended a day of college <br/>\nbut it was the best I could do.....<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87881,"nextTopicId":87842}}
