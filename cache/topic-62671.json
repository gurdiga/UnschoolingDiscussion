Is there anything else exciting around<br/>\n&gt; there? Hubby is thinking about making it into a road trip (I am still<br/>\n&gt; trying to convince him that the conference would be fun too, but we will<br/>\n&gt; see...he just keeps rolling his eyes...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Columbia, the capital. We have the State House, the Zoo, the State Museum, <br/>\nthe Art Museum, the Fire Station Museum, one of the top 20 libraries in the <br/>\ncountry. There are a TON of historic houses to tour, and Charleston is a two <br/>\nhour drive. (Ad there&#39;s always the pool at the hotel! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he might be VERY surprised how much fun it IT! There were several dads <br/>\nthere last year---maybe a few will come on and say how they felt about it. <br/>\n(Mike Slater was the most vocal!)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62690,"nextTopicId":62856}}
