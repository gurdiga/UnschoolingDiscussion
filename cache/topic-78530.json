I <br/>\nwas willing to pay for them, but was told I could just come pick them up. So I <br/>\ndid. There was zero wrong with the boxes themselves. The defects were generally <br/>\nlabeling errors, like the company name or printing being sideways as opposed <br/>\nto up or down. We also called our local grocery stores, asked for the store <br/>\nmanager and he notified the night crew responsible for stocking to not cut up <br/>\nnew boxes for a couple nights boxes. I went in and picked them up, they had <br/>\ncollapsed them so I could put more in the car, but they didn&#39;t cut any up. Maybe <br/>\nthese could be options for you????<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78543,"nextTopicId":78551}}
