It took me a year to get<br/>\nguardianship of my mother, she has Alzheimers.  My brother who was the<br/>\nclosest to her didn&#39;t want to do it or help other than sign that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nstop me.  We moved her out of her home & she&#39;s been in assisted living for a<br/>\nyear now & is in another world most of the time.  I used to be the daughter<br/>\nthat got in her way & was too independant & too different for her to want to<br/>\nknow.  My brother on the other hand let her do everything she wanted.  Guess<br/>\nthat shows you who the strongwilled child was in our house.  But now when<br/>\nthe staff talks to me they say I&#39;m the only one she speaks of.  And when my<br/>\nbrother came to see her (one time only) she didn&#39;t recognize him, I felt so<br/>\nbad for him.  He couldn&#39;t face seeing her this way so I&#39;m glad she&#39;s here in<br/>\ntown close to me.  The three youngest kids go with me to visit 1-2 times a<br/>\nweek.
