She came home and we started unschooling in the middle of grade 2 and she was convinced she couldn&#39;t read and that it was too difficult.  I didn&#39;t push it at all, just dropped it altogether and we all got into the Harry Potter series, she especially, and I read aloud regularly for the next year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI eventually came to realize that her definition of being able to read was to be able to sit down and read a large chapter book (like Harry Potter).  And she disliked the early readers and such intensely.  She would tell anyone and everyone who mentioned it that she couldn&#39;t read, and nothing I said would convince her otherwise.  I occasionally pointed out to her that she could read quite a few words and that she just hadn&#39;t met them all yet.  I mentioned that I was still coming across new words, nobody knows them all!  I told that if she was interested in reading a book herself, she could just ask me any words she came across that she didn&#39;t know yet and I&#39;d tell her.  No thanks, was her reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few more months I noticed that she was reading signs while we were driving, commercial stuff on TV etc that she wasn&#39;t before.  I just continued to point this out to her every so often.  Lo and behold about a month ago she was chatting/teasing with her older brother about something and I heard her say &quot;I can read, you know!&quot;.  Woohoo!!!  It may not seem like much, but I feel like she has turned a corner.  It&#39;s no longer about her &quot;being a reader&quot;, it&#39;s about her being interested in reading.  And I didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything except occasionally point out to her what reading she was already doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter me reading Harry Potter aloud very regularly over the past year (books 1-4 four times each, and #5 once), we have gotten them on CD and she is listening to them often (she just spent the last 3 days in her room listening to book 5 again .. she loves when I bring food & drinks up to her).  I know she loves a good story.  And although she hasn&#39;t ventured to pick up a book on her own yet, I know now it&#39;s just a matter of time and finding something interesting enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm ... maybe the Puppy Patrol pack in the book orders this month, I&#39;ll have to mention it to her (she loves dogs and is eager to volunteer at our local humane society shelter walking and feeding the animals - another thing for me to follow up on!).  Or poetry, she seems to really enjoy the one book of young kids poetry she has ...<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135843572,"authorName":"24hrmom","from":"&quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;24hrmom@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Intro + Reading Q","postDate":"1063219518","msgId":80192,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMzNzdjYiRhZWEzYzI2MCQwMzAwYThjMEBUaW5rZXJiZWxsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE0NS4xOGE0Y2MzNi4yYzkwOWVmMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":80190,"nextInTopic":80196,"prevInTime":80191,"nextInTime":80193,"topicId":80154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1302130567\">&lt;&lt;Keep it light and fun and don&#39;t count on it to do anything more than give <br/>\nthem a little more confidence and a few more clues, because confidence and clues <br/>\nare all they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes!! I lost this whole message in a freak power glitch on a nice, sunny day. This is me having taken a few deep breaths and rewriting (I thought Outlook would have saved my draft every 5 mins .. aaarrrgh, not).  So ....<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of nights ago my 6yo son leaned over while we were laying bed together and said &quot;I really want to learn how to read but only if I don&#39;t have to go to school.&quot;  I assured him he didn&#39;t and that he could learn it on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the suggestions int his thread have been great!!  I think though, that the advice above is really important.  Even when they express an interest, don&#39;t get invested in the idea that they will be &quot;reading&quot; soon or it will just become an experience in frustration for everyone involved.  Keep it light and fun and interesting for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Michael mentioned this I have been paying extra attention to the reading connections around us.  If we come across a short word or two I sound them out for him (no more than 10-15 seconds) - this is something he used to ask me not to do but he doesn&#39;t seem to mind now.  I point out words I know he already recognizes (from his games and interests - play, exit, scooby-doo, on, off etc.).  I&#39;ll probably install and reading computer game or two and start them up to see if he&#39;s interested, or not.  I&#39;ll ask regularly if he&#39;d like to read a book together - we used to read Scooby-Doo books every night but lately he wants to watch the show instead.  I&#39;ll make a point of playing video games with him more often so I can read more of those words, so that even though he&#39;s figured out how to play them on his own, I can bring out more of the storyline, if he&#39;s so inclined.  We do have fun playing with rhyming words - we take turns coming up with words that rhyme until we run out of them and start making up new ones.  I can transfer that game to reading like Sandra mentioned with her __ AT example.  Find what they already enjoy and extend the reading component for them, but only while it&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this morning he was playing on the Scooby-Doo website and I pointed out to him the words he had read - &quot;play&quot; and &quot;exit&quot; (I could tell he had read them by what he was doing and what he was asking me help with).  For one game he was typing in a question and he asked me how to spell the words.  I sounded out the shorter words, and the longer ones that made sense, as I was spelling and he didn&#39;t object.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd later this morning when I was walking to the mailbox I thought up a game he might like.  I&#39;ll write down the words he already knows along with some other words that he/we could sound out or recognize easily on separate pieces of paper and we could mix them up to create and read &quot;silly sentences&quot;.  He seems to like that kind of stuff.  Or maybe not.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust keep your eyes open for connections with their everyday life and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and one other thing.  Don&#39;t tell them there are things they can&#39;t do until they learn to read.  It&#39;s amazing what they will figure out on their own without reading (I remember Sandra&#39;s computer game story along these lines).  For example, my daughter got the Harry Potter Clue game for her birthday this past spring (it&#39;s jsut like the old Clue game but set at Hogwarts with Harry Poter characters etc).  When we first played I played with Michael so I could read the cards and mark down the clues.  When a few weeks ago he wanted to play on his own, I said sure.  I didn&#39;t tell he couldn&#39;t play because he doesn&#39;t read yet.  Though in the back of my mind I was wondering how I could allow him to win once in a while so he didn&#39;t get discouraged.  I needn&#39;t have worried!  He had the cards and the board memorized.  He makes meaningful guesses and remembers the clues all on his own.  It&#39;s just amazing watching him search his mind to remember all the info when he gets to Fluffy to make his guess.  Soemtimes he&#39;ll ask me to read out all the spells so he can sort out in his mind which one hasn&#39;t been played, and he always figures it out on his own.  We play together quite often and he wins regularly ... definitely more often than I do!<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Intro + Reading Q","postDate":"1063218269","msgId":80190,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyZjcwMWMzNzdjYSQwYTQzN2NjMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGJqbmYzaStiM25vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":80188,"nextInTopic":80192,"prevInTime":80189,"nextInTime":80191,"topicId":80154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes cartoon <br/>\ncharacters or the names of their friends&#39; dogs or last names of families we knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still find parts of home-made word-strip things, with a piece of cardboard <br/>\nand a strip of paper with letters that can be pulled through to change one <br/>\nletter in a word, like <br/>\n_ A T  <br/>\nwith two slit-holes in the cardboard to pull through a strip of paper that <br/>\nhad letters which would make a word of _AT<br/>\nlike <br/>\nB<br/>\nC<br/>\nF<br/>\nH<br/>\nM<br/>\nP<br/>\nand maybe some blends at the end<br/>\nFL<br/>\nDR<br/>\nbut not too many<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep it light and fun and don&#39;t count on it to do anything more than give <br/>\nthem a little more confidence and a few more clues, because confidence and clues <br/>\nare all they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"joanna514","from":"&quot;joanna514&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Intro + Reading Q","postDate":"1063206834","msgId":80168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJqbmYzaStiM25vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHAwNTIwMGYwNGJiODRhNzE5NjE0ZUBbMjA0LjE4OS4xMS40MV0+"},"prevInTopic":80165,"nextInTopic":80170,"prevInTime":80167,"nextInTime":80169,"topicId":80154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I haven t read anyone elses posts, yet.

This is a tough one, because my dd is very social and<br/>\nloves to play with other kids.  She gets lonely, and at times I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any ideas to solve this problem.  What do other families with<br/>\nonly one outgoing child do??<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to be part of our school&#39;s homeschool program when my dd turns 5 so<br/>\nthat we can participate in some of the school things if we want to (like<br/>\nafter school art classes, plays, etc.)  The homeschool coordinator is<br/>\ngreat; when I met her 2-3 years ago she introduced me to John Holt and the<br/>\nwhole idea of unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far it&#39;s been easy to unschool.  We live our lives, my dd helps when she<br/>\nwants to, she is almost always with me, and we find lots to do.  She<br/>\ncurrently has gymnastics, music, and dance classes.  These classes were<br/>\noriginally my idea starting about 2 years ago, but I never had any<br/>\nexpectations that we had to stay and finish them -- it was just<br/>\nexploration.  Now she wants to be in all of them, and has even asked for<br/>\nmore (ballet, art, flute, and swimming!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is our reading situation.  My dd has told me numerous times that<br/>\nshe wants to learn to read.  I&#39;m starting to take this as a request from<br/>\nher for me to help.  Even though she is in several classes, none of them<br/>\n&quot;teach&quot;, so I don&#39;t think she has the notion to ask me to &quot;teach&quot; her; in<br/>\nfact, I expect that for her a teacher is someone who gives you fun<br/>\nresources to play and explore with.  So, since she wants to learn to read I<br/>\ncould give her fun resources to play and explore with.  But, I am at a<br/>\ntotal loss as to what this would look like!!  I must admit that I did have<br/>\nan image that she would just pick up a book one day and magically start to<br/>\nread it, perhaps after asking a few questions.  My dh taught himself to<br/>\nread at a very early age, and I was the kind of kid who, if I had not been<br/>\nin school, wouldn&#39;t have been bothered to read until a very late age - and<br/>\nthen would have been reading voraciously overnight.  She seems to be<br/>\nsomewhere in the middle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have an understanding of what works better for her.  She seems to<br/>\nbe a sight word reader, learning whole words.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;d be that<br/>\nkeen on phonics.  On the other hand, she loves sounds and often recognizes<br/>\nwords because of some of the letters/sounds she sees (like &quot;it must be open<br/>\nbecause there is a P in the sign&quot;) - so what do I really know.  Perhaps<br/>\nshe&#39;s just learned the words she knows because of sight and context and<br/>\nphonics would fill in some missing pieces for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice?  Do I get a reading workbook to see if she likes that?  Do I<br/>\ntry phonics in some fun way to check this out?  My initial reaction is to<br/>\navoid anything like this...  that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing for over a year<br/>\nnow.  But she continues to bring up the desire to read, even more so<br/>\nrecently.  I don&#39;t want to ignore her request, even if it isn&#39;t explicit.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong... I am not in a hurry.  If she didn&#39;t start reading<br/>\nuntil she was 12 (or whatever) that would be fine with me.  I love reading<br/>\nstories out loud; we love to listen to books on tape together.  What I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do is miss her request for some specific resource to help her<br/>\nexplore.  If she were older and had more experience/exposure I expect she&#39;d<br/>\nbe able to say &quot;Mom, I want to know all about whats-it, could you find me<br/>\nsome things to help.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really starting to ramble now, but I just thought about our experience<br/>\nwith art.  We collect all sorts of stuff from art stores, crafts stores,<br/>\nnature, even the trash.  We have so many boxes and cupboards full of art<br/>\nmaterials to explore.  There is no right or wrong way to explore the paint,<br/>\nglue, glitter, stencils, pens, paper, beads, feathers, pine cones,<br/>\nacorns... oh you get the idea.  She creates art, and loves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo other than reading lots of stories, or seeing signs around us when we&#39;re<br/>\nout and about in towns -- what do we do to have lots of stuff around to<br/>\nhelp with the exploration of reading?  Like with the art, there must be<br/>\nlots of ways to explore reading (I just can&#39;t think of any - LOL!)  On the<br/>\nother hand, it isn&#39;t anything like art in that you can&#39;t really do it until<br/>\nyou have some additional knowledge.  Like telling time... it doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nsense until all of a sudden - click; then there is some knowledge and now<br/>\nyou can do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, sorry for the rambling.  It is helpful to put my thoughts down in an<br/>\nemail; thanks for reading ;-)  I&#39;m glad to be part of the list and<br/>\nconnected with others who know what unschooling is and don&#39;t ask me the<br/>\n&quot;socialization&quot; question!  I look forward to learning more about what<br/>\nunschooling looks like in your lives, and seeing it unfold for us in ours.<br/>\n<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80217,"nextTopicId":80029}}
