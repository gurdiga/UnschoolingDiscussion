Before, I would ask my child what was<br/>\n&gt; wrong, why they were doing that, etc.  I would encourage the one being<br/>\n&gt; bothered to ask the other one to stop or see if they could work something<br/>\n&gt; out together.  If the behaviour did not stop, I would tell the one doing<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; bothering that they would need to stop or I would take them out of the<br/>\nbath.<br/>\n&gt;   So this is a parent-delivered consequence, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now if I did not take the child out of the bath, what would I do?  It<br/>\nisn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; fair to the child who is trying to play and is continually being bothered.<br/>\n&gt; And if I don&#39;t do anything about it, will my children see me as being<br/>\n&gt; somebody they don&#39;t need to listen to?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you - I am trying to figure out the right balance for situations<br/>\nsuch<br/>\n&gt; as these.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Erika  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;J.

Maybe something Joyce alluded to is true, that there are more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;advanced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; levels of unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a family shows up here who&#39;s still doing school at home and wants<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unschool, maybe the talk about food and chores and bedtimes is just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;going<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelm and confuse them.  Because there CAN be unschooling in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;family<br/>\n&gt; &gt;where kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also have chores and bedtimes and have to clean their plates.   I<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally think it will have the depth or benefit, ultimately, as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;house<br/>\n&gt; &gt;where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the children&#39;s preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it<br/>\ncould<br/>\n&gt; &gt;still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a family quits all their routines and the kids go crazy eating<br/>\ncandy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watching TV because they never got to before, but the parents still<br/>\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;get&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling and so are still pressing &quot;schoolwork,&quot; what a mess THAT<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt;going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be.   It&#39;s not just carts before horses, it might be climbing into<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cart and hopping up and down before they&#39;re even sure what a horse is.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope that&#39;s not happening.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t guess this is a problem particular to unschooling, though.<br/>\nSome<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people dress like skaters without getting wheels of any sort.

There is nothing about unschooling that says one person should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, which is, I think, what Sandra was getting at. As a parent, I have an obligation to protect my children, even from each other if need be. Sam&#39;s right to extend his fist stops at someone else&#39;s body--in this country and in my unschooling home. But it also does not mean that I hit him, send him to his room alone, call him bad names, or any number of other punitive things. Removing from the situation is not punitive, in my mind, if it is done in a firm, but loving way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if &quot;bothering&quot; means that he wants to play too just not by the other&#39;s rules, then that&#39;s not really bothering in a sense that needs to be stopped, know what I mean? It&#39;s an impasse where they need to figure out a solution that can meet everyone&#39;s needs. If it&#39;s an imaginative game, then the rules need to get renegotiated to include everyone in the game, not just the people who were there first. This isn&#39;t a blanket statement, by any means; I can easily imagine scenarios in which the person&#39;s rules should be honored. But, this would end up coming out in a renegotiation, I would hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, the other day my kids were playing with their Imaginext pirate ship and Julia had her Disney princesses up in the crow&#39;s nest. Sam came over to play and began knocking them out with his pirate, which upset Julia. The ship belongs to all of them, so in my view, it&#39;s not fair if the girls are always making the rules for the games and the only way Sam can play is to play by their rules. He&#39;s not really &quot;bothering&quot; them if he is trying to play in a legitimate but different way. They need to find a way to play that accommodates all of them. Of course, one gets into the quagmire of having to decide what constitutes &quot;legitimate,&quot; which is why negotiation and rational exchange is so important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the way it works in my house anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n  Erika wrote:<br/>\n  For example, let&#39;s say that my children are having a bath and one is <br/>\n  purposely bothering the other one.

Maybe something Joyce alluded to is true, that there are more<br/>\n&gt;advanced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; levels of unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If a family shows up here who&#39;s still doing school at home and wants to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschool, maybe the talk about food and chores and bedtimes is just <br/>\n&gt;going<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; overwhelm and confuse them.

In the motel I was staying at I heard a rustling in bags I had by the door.  I thought it was a mouse at first, and then the darn thing came out and looked at me.... and I said you are no mouse.  Well I thought I would be alright, I would just make sure it stayed on the floor and didn&#39;t get on me or the kids......but no it climbed the wall.  I ran out of the room to tell the manager that there was a creature in my room.  He asks me if its a cockroach,  Like none I&#39;ve ever seen!  It took him 3 or 4 times hitting it with my ked to kill it.  I thought I was cured, and then the giant grasshopper..... 7 years later I was living here.  The weather is beautiful, and the kids are amazed at how far I&#39;ve come.  If its in my house, it doesn&#39;t belong in here, thats it.

This is a trap we fell into when we first<br/>\nreleased the controls after unschooling for a couple of years.  I had been<br/>\ntold over and over that kids would learn to self-regulate on things if I<br/>\nwould just be patient.  I thought that meant that I should completely back<br/>\noff and the kids would stop doing &quot;insane&quot; things.  Example:  The kids<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t quit jumping on my bed, even though I asked them not to and<br/>\nexplained why (old mattress, old bed, no money for that right now, etc.).  I<br/>\nfelt that if I kicked them out of my room, they weren&#39;t &quot;self-regulating&quot;.<br/>\nI was regulating them by punishing them by kicking them out of my room when<br/>\nthey jumped on the bed..  And I had been told over and over that punishment<br/>\nwas counter-productive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a while for me to find the difference between punishment and<br/>\nconsequences due to lack of personal responsibility.  I finally came to the<br/>\nprinciple of &quot;not doing harm&quot; and that has helped me understand where the<br/>\nline is.  But it is, I think, a progession, a maturing into unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, January 09, 2004 11:16 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/9/04 3:37:19 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephc62@...\">stephc62@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I finally had to say I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do it myself and would you mind<br/>\n&gt; doing this or that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think anyone ever recommended telling kids &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll do<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; all myself,&quot; so sometimes when I hear the problems being caused I&#39;m<br/>\ncurious as<br/>\n&gt; to how it was presented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But just as with school, if kids were &quot;made to work&quot; and it was considered<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; something to be avoided, their first instinct will be to avoid it, and<br/>\nmaybe the<br/>\n&gt; more pressure and work there was when it was required, the longer and more<br/>\n&gt; intensely they&#39;ll want to avoid it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But not cleaning all the time isn&#39;t the opposite of making a horrible mess<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; purpose.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of all the issues we&#39;ve ever discussed here, I think the housework and<br/>\nchores<br/>\n&gt; is the most marginal of all to unschooling, and I&#39;m a little nervous at<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; effect.

I think.  The process of deschooling may be where this came in because at one time chores were a part of our school... I hate writing this because it is like so stupid now. LOL.  So deschooling would involve getting rid of chore charts etc. and then after a while things start getting put back where they were but in a different perspective.  That is the way I&#39;m seeing it now.  After going to the Live and Learn Conference, reading lots about unschooling I gradually saw that &quot;Hey they are not doing absolutely nothing&quot; and it just kind of dawned on me.  They are doing more in a different light, everything is learning, interaction with the kids not the I am the teacher you are the student.&quot;  I actually know some parents that have a separate school room to go to..... and some kids have to call their parents Mrs so and so because that makes it more official.  I could never do that and have always been called undisciplined and the kids would be better off in school etc.  So I basically keep to myself, this group and a friendly relaxed homeschool support group.

I am at the tail end of raising 6 boys, the <br/>\noldest will be 31 next month, all 4 of the older boys went through the ps system <br/>\nwith the exception of 1 year we hs&#39;d with 5 of them. We came to hsing as a <br/>\nlifestyle later in the game, our youngest 2 were about 7 and 10 when we pulled them <br/>\nout of school.

That was a hard lesson to learn but one <br/>\nthat is priceless. For example yesterday my 16yros came to me and told me he had <br/>\ngiven it a lot of thought and he wanted to return to school next year. A few <br/>\nyears ago I would have been devastated but for some reason that has changed. <br/>\nWe talked about it a little, I mean I really don&#39;t want him to go but he had <br/>\nsome good reasons and so I asked him what grade he wanted to be in, he answered <br/>\n11th. So, I told him what he would need to do to be able to enter that grade <br/>\nin our school district and he set off to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12yros and I had some errands to run and were gone most of the day. When <br/>\nwe got back I asked the 16yro how it was going and he told me upon further <br/>\nthought he won&#39;t be going, after all he can drive soon and make friends and find <br/>\ngirls that way.

I don&#39;t know why he came in, sometimes they just do make it in there and I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t want to be.  It could have been just a mistake on his part.  I know that my  laundry room makes me nervous sometimes as I have a doggie door and I know that only doggies don&#39;t use them.  There was a woman that had been bitten on the wrist because a poisonous snake had decided to sit in her dirty laundry that was on the floor in front of the washer.  So I will be cautious out there and did buy hampers for the clothes rather than have them bunched up on the floor.  I will be happy if the kids can get their clothes in them, also that they would sort it on the way there too ROFL, I can dream.  Here in FL we can bring home nasty roaches just by coming in with groceries as they hide in bags and boxes so I have someone spray every month and step up on getting rid of them when I see them.  We also had some rodents not to long ago, I don&#39;t think they came in because we are messy, but once I noticed them I stepped up on keeping kitchen clean and trash out until we (kitties and me) got rid of them.  Just my thoughts.

It was quite a humorous image!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, I know what you mean, though not to your extent! Southern Maryland, where we live, is _very_ wet and humid, and we have bugs like you might find in the rain forest! &lt;g&gt; Seriously, we have wolf spiders here that rival tarantulas--they are the largest spiders I have ever seen outside of captivity (and I DON&#39;T like spiders!). I also became an &quot;expert&quot; on cockroaches this spring because I was finding some in my house. Turns out that they were, thankfully, wood cockroaches that don&#39;t infest homes but often find their way into homes during wet springs, and we had the wettest year on record last year. Our family room is the basement of our split level home, so this is where the bugs come in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pretty much just say to the kids that we need to pick up and vacuum fairly regularly if we don&#39;t want bugs. They&#39;ve found them often enough that they understand that bugs and spiders will hide under their dress-up clothes, etc. They don&#39;t much like that!  My kids are really very good about helping to do a quick pick up so that I can run a vacuum as long as I am there helping them. I don&#39;t have them put everything back in its &quot;proper&quot; place (once in a while for sanity we do a real clean up), and they know they can put whatever it is they are playing with or working on up on a piece of furniture while I vacuum. My youngest says constantly, &quot;you done now mama?&quot; and as soon as I am, they all jump down and run like wild things, shouting &quot;yeah, we can run, we can run!&quot;  because the floor is not all cluttered with sharp little toys. So there are upsides to picking up, and it doesn&#39;t have to be whole sale or stressful or anything. With everyone working together it takes maybe 15 minutes to pick up and vacuum--not too big a deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key is to enlist their help by explaining your reasons and fears. They might have some really good ideas too that you hadn&#39;t thought of. I&#39;m a big fan of presenting problems or issues as something for the whole family to deal with--the process is very productive and everyone owns the outcome. Dh and I might talk about things first by ourselves, depending upon the magnitude of the situation, but before we do anything we present to the kids and get their input.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n  Stephany wrote:<br/>\n  Julie, I didn&#39;t know what a dugite was until you said snake and I&#39;m interested.

I finally had to say I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do it myself and would you mind doing this or that.    It is working, and I also pay them when they can.  I told them they would be responsible for their own clothes, meaning getting them to the hamper to be washed, helping with folding and drying.  The oldest on is 14 and she will go straight to the sink and wash dishes with no problem at all, and most things she is like that with.  When I read you had a dugite I knew I didn&#39;t want one of those what ever they were, LOL.  I have started putting things away in bins, and when they ask for something I tell them it is in storage and they can go look if they want it.   I also made a list of things to do today and couragesly asked one of the kids to write something down on it and then cross it off because I had done it, ya know like Frog and Toad... got a big smile for that one.  I&#39;ll be praying.
