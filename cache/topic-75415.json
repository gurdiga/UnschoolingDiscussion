I&#39;d love to see more &quot;this is what we did today&quot;<br/>\nposts.&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m up and it&#39;s late and I&#39;m not sleepy so I&#39;ll see if I can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrst thing this morning we discovered that Sierra lost her tooth during the<br/>\nnight so I sent her off to find it while I got out of bed. She found the<br/>\ntooth and I greeted the rest of the household. Let the dog outside and hosed<br/>\npoop and cleaned up fallen mangoes while Sierra and Alyssa watched tv and<br/>\nJoseph played in his room. Then Sierra hit the computer and Joseph joined<br/>\nher to watch. I was getting ready to go out and have no idea what they<br/>\nplayed but it sounded like fun. Alyssa played in her room, watched tv,<br/>\nvisited with my mom and visited with me. Then one by one they decided to eat<br/>\nso I fixed breakfast and that went on for about 30 minutes. Then I cleaned<br/>\nup all the while talking to the kids while they ate and we had on tv also.<br/>\nIt was Blues Clues and Scooby. Joseph and Sierra played YuGiOh cards in the<br/>\nplayroom with a twist. They set up a huge gameboard with the foam play<br/>\nsquares we have complete with barricades and such that they incorporated<br/>\ninto the game. It was too complicated for me to follow but they played that<br/>\nfor about an hour. All the while Alyssa was all over the house playing with<br/>\nthe dog, her toys and me. When Joseph and Sierra had enough, they cleaned up<br/>\nand Alyssa came out to help as she wanted the tent up in the playroom.<br/>\nJoseph went back in his room on the computer and I set up the tent for<br/>\nAlyssa. Sierra asked her if she could play in there so they both took in<br/>\ntheir Polly Pocket dolls, some stuffed animals and plastic links. (the links<br/>\nwere rain) About 20 minutes later Joseph came out and asked if he could play<br/>\ntoo. Good thing it&#39;s a big tent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey played in there for quite awhile. When they were done we all helped to<br/>\nclean it up. I left the house to take Tara&#39;s car for window tinting and came<br/>\nhome with my husband. Joe played with all three of them for awhile, ate<br/>\nsomething and left again. They watched some tv and ran around the house<br/>\nplaying hide and seek. It&#39;s Alyssa&#39;s new favorite game and Joseph and Sierra<br/>\nhave been very obliging. Then they played something where Alyssa was a leach<br/>\nand she chased them and would stick to them and suck out all their blood!!!!<br/>\nThat was Joseph&#39;s idea. Joseph ate and of course Alyssa is snacking the<br/>\nwhole day anyway.  Joseph and Sierra went through all their coloring and<br/>\npuzzle books and were working in them. Alyssa joined in. Then they all found<br/>\ntattoos that I put on them. Then they played with Furbies. Joe came home, I<br/>\nleft with him and Tara to go and get her car. Tara and I went grocery<br/>\nshopping. She drove me around. How nice. I almost got carded at the grocery<br/>\nstore for beer. How nice again!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCame home and fed the kids again. Joseph and Sierra went swimming. Alyssa<br/>\nwent to my moms and played with dolls, ate and colored. When the kids came<br/>\nin from the pool, they went back outside after they dried off. Then all 3<br/>\nkids ended up in Sierra&#39;s room playing I&#39;m not sure what. They eventually<br/>\nended up at the dining room table all drawing and playing with their people.<br/>\nAlyssa started about 3 movies during the course of the day and never made it<br/>\nthrough more than 10 minutes. Joseph and Sierra cleared off the dining room<br/>\nas I asked them too because we have friends coming over tomorrow. Next thing<br/>\nI knew it was about 11:30 where I suggested bed. Sierra and Alyssa were at<br/>\nmy moms and Joseph was drawing. The two girls went to bed and Joseph cleaned<br/>\nhis room and then started drawing again. He went to bed around midnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was a day where the 3 little ones were very busy both alone and with<br/>\neach other more so than usual. It was also a day where they were on their<br/>\nown more than usual too. Most days have some reading or tv watching with me.<br/>\nOr game playing or puzzles. I wasn&#39;t needed today but to just be around.<br/>\nThat and to put up the tent. The activities vary but our at home days<br/>\nwithout friends are pretty much like this.

She had been looking forward <br/>\nto this day for awhile--a day where she and I go to the mall together <br/>\nfor a shopping spree with her birthday money.  We stopped at burger <br/>\nking on the way and got an odor-rama card (scratch and sniff card to <br/>\nuse during the movie where the rugrats meet the wild thornberries).  <br/>\nThen we went to the 11:15 movie, spent all afternoon shopping, went <br/>\nto the 4:45 Bruce Almighty movie, stopped at taco bell and then came <br/>\nhome.  Right before the 4:45 movie we put all our shopping bags in <br/>\nthe HOT car.  When we got back in the car after taco bell, the bath <br/>\nand body works bag was overflowing with PURPLE BUBBLES!  The heat had <br/>\ncaused the lid of the grape foam soap to pop off.  We went back into <br/>\nthe mall with our bubbly bag (dropping purple bubbles along the way), <br/>\nshowed them our bag, and they gave us a new purple foam soap. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout our day we talked about materialism, calculated percents-<br/>\noff, talked about saving money for good sales, and talked about <br/>\nchemcial reactions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back at home, my husband spent much of his day in the <br/>\nswimming pool with the boys.  He was so excited when we got home to <br/>\nreport that our 4 year old is jumping in on his own and swimming <br/>\nunderwater to him and that our 6 year old is going down the slide and <br/>\nswimming to the ladder himself.  They had a blast today. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way to and from the mall (45 minute drive) dd and I listened <br/>\nto Harry Potter on audio tape.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home, I talked to the boys about their day, took a <br/>\nshower, rested on my bed and read a little bit of a book that I&#39;m <br/>\nreading, and got on the computer for a few minutes.  My six year old, <br/>\nwho isn&#39;t reading yet and is very into Thomas the tank engine and <br/>\ncomputer games, brought me some pieces of paper.  He said that they <br/>\nwere tickets and wanted to know if I would like to &quot;buy&quot; one.  He had <br/>\nwritten Thomas on each one of them.  I bought a ticket from him with <br/>\npretend money. :) Then I took him up to bed and read a Rokenbok flyer <br/>\nto him.  He has decided that he wants to start buying Rokenbok stuff <br/>\nand is very excited about his birthday so that he can get money to <br/>\nbuy the stuff with.  He has talked his little brother into combining <br/>\ntheir birthday money so that they can buy it quicker. After I read <br/>\nthe flyer to him (descriptions, testimonials, prices, etc.), he fell <br/>\nasleep with his rokenbok flyer as he has done every night for the <br/>\nlast week. :)  I tucked my 4 year old in, and then went into my <br/>\ndaugher&#39;s room for a Yu-gi-oh match.  We have recently started <br/>\nplaying the game and to our delight, found a card store only 1/2 an <br/>\nhour from us that is having a tournament on Saturday!  She wants to <br/>\nenter the tournament and we want to practice and try to learn all the <br/>\nrules we need to know by then.  (She&#39;s trying to talk me into <br/>\nentering too!)  There are still some things we haven&#39;t done yet, like <br/>\nlearn how to do polymerization and the 15-card side decks.  We were <br/>\nup playing yu-gi-oh until almost 1:00!
