And why?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re talking about towns, Eugene, Oregon is probably up there. We have<br/>\nto test 3 times during the &quot;school years&quot; (3rd grade is the first test, and<br/>\ntwo others after that) but hopefully the Oregon legislature is going to<br/>\nchange that to no testing soon. Other than that, there seems to be a fair<br/>\nnumber of unschoolers and relaxed homeschoolers here, a good local<br/>\nhomeschooling group with lots of activities and cool parents to hang out<br/>\nwith, lots of involved dads (which seems to be the rule in this town in<br/>\ngeneral, we always see dads at playgrounds and on bike paths), great access<br/>\nto camping, beach, mountains, etc. and a fair number of cultural events for<br/>\na town our size (130,000). Eugeneans use their public library more than<br/>\nresidents of any other city in America, and we just completed a brand-new<br/>\n3-story library.<br/>\nOther things I like about the town are the generally relaxed atmosphere and<br/>\nthe fact that all types of people fit in here, and kids seem to be fairly<br/>\nwelcome and respected. Eugene is a quirky town and I like the quirks. The<br/>\nguy who does Tai Chi while bicycling through town, the guy who has been<br/>\nselling Frog Joke Books for twenty years out of a little wagon, the 80 year<br/>\nold woman who wears a tall Uncle Sam hat and a paisley dress and dances<br/>\nthrough downtown. People seem to be taken here at more or less face value.<br/>\nWhen my 3 year old dyed her hair purple this year, she got lots of<br/>\ncompliments, for instance. When my 6 year old approached a guy who runs a<br/>\nlocal gardening store, the man answered all his questions and invited him to<br/>\ncome back and he&#39;d show him how to propagate plants. It&#39;s just a friendly<br/>\nkind of place. Also very environmental, which appeals to me. Hundreds of<br/>\nmiles of bike paths and trails and tons of people bicycle here. People bring<br/>\ntheir own canvas bags to the grocery store, and stores advertise that they<br/>\nuse wind or solar power for their electricity. A local bicycle store gives<br/>\naway a pound of tofu if you buy a new set of bicycle tires (which is a joke<br/>\non a much bigger car tire chain in the west that gives away free beef with a<br/>\nset of car tires).<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s my pitch for Eugene today. We really love it here. It could<br/>\nhave a tad more sunshine in the spring and fall, and colder weather in the<br/>\nwinter (I&#39;d prefer snow to rain), but that&#39;s my only improvements I&#39;d make.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3490918,"authorName":"MDMomatHm@aol.com","from":"MDMomatHm@...","profile":"mdmomathm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Best place to live","postDate":"1052540512","msgId":68390,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MC4xZTYxOGNmNy4yYmVkZDg2MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68378,"nextInTopic":68399,"prevInTime":68389,"nextInTime":68391,"topicId":68350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My opinion is the state of Michigan ...where we no longer live.
