I can t say that I have experienced this personally, but I reallly  liked the way the teacher handled this situation on the Little Bill cartoon.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-626445202\">I agree.  I can&#39;t say that I have experienced this personally, but I reallly  liked the way the &quot;teacher&quot; handled this situation on the Little Bill cartoon.  Andrew was angry that Little Bill was copying him and called him a copy cat.  Teach let him know that it hurt Little Bill&#39;s feelings to be called a name, like copy cat.  And let him know that really, Little Bill mostly just had similar tastes.  And that if there were things that Bill chose just because Andrew liked them, well, that was a compliment and meant that Bill respected and valued Andrew&#39;s opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also add to this that just as I try to stay out of the way and let my child choose to play her way, I remind her that anyone else visiting with us (or when I used to babysit) enjoys that same option.  Everyone can play with the toy or wear the veil in their own way.  In other words, if the older child gets the pleasure of choosing what she wants to wear, then so does the younger child, even if it is copying the older child.  I don&#39;t see any problem with offering or suggesting alternatives to the younger child, but really what they wear or call their stuffed animals should be their choice, right?  The older child doesn&#39;t *have* to feel animosity about being copied.  Those feelings are her own.  Though she might appreciate a little help in pondering how else she might choose to feel.   This is just more on the subject of one person enforcing behaviors on another.  Seems much better to suggest alternatives but in the end to stay out of the way and let them work it out.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLike LIttle Bill, I would hate to think that I coulnd&#39;t have pizza for lunch just because my best friend got it too and he doesn&#39;t like for me to get the same thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Angela S <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, February 08, 2005 7:20 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] she copies me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  *      Really, it&#39;s a<br/>\n  compliment...maybe you could help her see it like<br/>\n  that?. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My girls are less than 2 year apart and have always like to dress the same.<br/>\n  In fact,  I thought it was funny because it was my older dd who would try to<br/>\n  dress like her sister more often than not, when they were little.

We never did the &quot;twins&quot; look. but in our tiny town with only two places that sell kids clothes it was common to find something in their size with just one or two  color or size choices.<br/>\nNow, no way..Some is strong color preferences but mostly it is a really strong aversion to the realization (from about age 6) that most people-even close relatives have never bothered to know which twin was which. Note-that they are only fraternal twins and  really only look like sisters in any family. They wear their hair differently but only now that Kara has glasses has their &quot;closest&quot; aunt  addressed them by name. <br/>\nTheir cousins have no trouble  with it. It is just so rude-of course they don&#39;t care.<br/>\nThe girls have always been quite wounded by this- now they won&#39;t answer if someone asks them if they are twins- I never could figure out why people get so stunned by twins. Quads or quints maybe.<br/>\nThey also get annoyed if their  sister wants something that they  see because they also don&#39;t want  the other to have  the same thing- Identical Barbies are grudgingly acceptable but they quickly make them &quot;individualized&quot;<br/>\nThis year  they  had to get the same snow boots after Xmas and the only ones  left that fit well were the same kind and color. Luckily they could see that and it went quite well.<br/>\nSo I guess the &quot;answer&quot; is that its pretty common for kids not to want the other to dress the same.-no help eh?  ;-)<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.8.6 - Release Date: 2/7/05<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] she copies me!","postDate":"1107865247","msgId":103192,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjA4MTIyMDQxLkJQQVEyNDg3Ni5tdGExMS5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbGVpZ2g+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjA4MDUxNzIwLjM2MzM0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDIzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":103186,"nextInTopic":103227,"prevInTime":103191,"nextInTime":103193,"topicId":103171,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*\tReally, it s a compliment...maybe you could help her see it like that?.
