My kids and I love it.  It is fun to play and<br/>\nhas won two awards for best educational software.  While playing the<br/>\ngame, kids are using math and logic skills, but would not realize that<br/>\nthey are &quot;doing math&quot; unless someone told them.  I got in on e-toys.  It<br/>\nis also in the February Scholastic Classroom catalog (our homeschool<br/>\ngroup does this).  The only problem is that my kids are wanting to use<br/>\nthe computer more often.  I need to get them their own so I still have<br/>\ntime to use one myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am closely acquainted with a couple who adopted two children.  Within<br/>\nweeks of the adoption being final, she filed for divorce.  10 years<br/>\nlater, this couple still cannot communicate civilly with each other and<br/>\nthe kids bear the brunt of poor parenting and a split household, not to<br/>\nmention whatever long term affects the prenatal drug and alcohol abuse<br/>\nwill hold for them.  Putting children up for adoption does not guarantee<br/>\na better life for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight... Stay Active...
