It is as simple as &quot;Jayn may eat or drink as<br/>\nmuch or little of anything she likes whenever she wants, but she is allergic<br/>\nto peanuts.&quot; I would not be leaving her with someone who was uncongenial or<br/>\nunwilling to let her eat her food, or leave it either (and I would always<br/>\nhave the food bag to leave with her)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy job as an Unschooler is to help Jayn wander as far into everything that<br/>\nappeals to her as she wants to, and as far as we can manage from a practical<br/>\npoint of view. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your daughter is &quot;testing those boundaries&quot; to use some<br/>\njargon from modern parenting. Are we still talking about food?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;There is a mom in my local group however whose kids tho &#39;restricted&#39; <br/>\nas many might think of them would never stray from what they know by <br/>\nhome example to be appropriate without qualms.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Would never&quot; is a big phrase.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes &quot;qualms&quot; mean these are children who are afraid of their parents, or<br/>\npunishment? Jayn has no fear of dh or me. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I cannot be sure what causes this but it does lead me to believe <br/>\nsetting limits does not always mean children will rebel and resent.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you recommending restrictions then? I&#39;m not understanding your point. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;But also watching some families and kids it does seem that tho in age <br/>\nmany children are old enough to make their own choices in actuality <br/>\nthey are not mature enough, not being groomed toward that outcome, or <br/>\nthe parents simply do not want to relinquish their control over <br/>\ncertain issues so the children reamain stunted or at least contained.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much for the opportunity to cross post something I wrote<br/>\nseveral weeks ago on U/B. Warning to members of both lists - here comes some<br/>\nof the &quot;Buzz Words&quot; post again - feel free to stop reading now if this is<br/>\nold news.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlightly Modified Quote Begins:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to look at some semantics here... because of a larger issue of<br/>\nhow we as Unschoolers are beyond a lot of modern parenting and its<br/>\ndiscourses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to suggest the idea that in the wider parenting world the words<br/>\n&quot;implementing limits&quot;, or more usually &quot;setting limits&quot;, is a buzz word<br/>\nphrase - politically correct jargon of supposedly aware parenting, which can<br/>\noften be translated into &quot;controlling the children&#39;s behavior&quot;. &quot;Limits&quot; can<br/>\nmean &quot;what parents tolerate in their comfort zone&quot;. Similarly, the term<br/>\n&quot;consequences&quot; is often a euphemistic way of saying &quot;punishments&quot; - even<br/>\nthough time outs or grounding or doing specific related chores (like washing<br/>\nthe walls off [after drawing on them] for example) are orders of magnitude<br/>\nbetter than old fashioned strategies like screamed insults, shame and guilt,<br/>\nspanking, being sent to bed with or without supper, or being sent off to<br/>\nmilitary school or ensconced in a nunnery. <br/>\n<br/>\nLists that discuss unschooling often include so much that is about changing<br/>\nyour parenting on a deep thought level, so using these part-time buzz words<br/>\nmay spark unexpected semantics based responses. From the TV series based on<br/>\nthe Buddhist folk tale &quot;Monkey&quot;: &quot;With our thoughts we make the world&quot;. With<br/>\n(only) our words, we make our thoughts known online. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother modern parenting idea is &quot;Give your children choices&quot;. How could<br/>\nthis be problematic for Unschoolers? Well, I recall an episode of Oprah<br/>\nwhere a very nice modern mother was enthusing about the various strategies<br/>\nshe uses for ease of parenting and family life - her big tool was &quot;giving<br/>\nkids choices&quot; that included which color of jacket to put on. For anyone who<br/>\nhas been around unschooling for even a little while, it just looks like<br/>\nmanipulation - hmmm, actually it *is* manipulation (and [she was] proud of<br/>\nit!). The choices aren&#39;t real, they are &quot;practice choices&quot; in situations<br/>\nthat are resoundingly trivial, because the idea is to fool the kid into<br/>\nbehaving a certain way, and any alternative outside of the two or three<br/>\nparent sanctioned ideas is not &quot;given&quot;. Again, a huge improvement over no<br/>\nchoices at all and fear based obedience, but not as enlightened as<br/>\nunschooling can be. Gosh, it sounds smug to use &quot;enlightened&quot; but it still<br/>\nseems the best word.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are usually on a path towards real choices that their children<br/>\n&quot;make&quot; rather than being &quot;given&quot; or &quot;permitted&quot;. Sometimes this means<br/>\ngritting your teeth and biting your tongue. Occasionally these real choices<br/>\nare likely to have crummy (but presumably not life or limb threatening)<br/>\nresults, especially when the children are young. For most &quot;ordinary parents&quot;<br/>\nthe teeth gritting over bad choices comes when the youngster is grown up or<br/>\nin their late teens and is suddenly &quot;given&quot; (translation: mandatory<br/>\nacceptance) responsibilities and adult behavior expectations. We get to<br/>\npractice gritting for way longer. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne quantum leap in thinking is letting go of the &quot;giving&quot; of choices.<br/>\nInstead it becomes about &quot;creating&quot; an environment and lifestyle where the<br/>\nchildren, and indeed the adults in the family, have the opportunity to make<br/>\nreal choices, or dither about making them. A principles-based lifestyle,<br/>\ninstead of a hierarchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt becomes about letting go of the need to ensure that they are &quot;learning<br/>\nfrom their mistakes&quot; and not have every bad result elucidated for them, as<br/>\nif they were too stupid to notice that they felt cold when they didn&#39;t<br/>\nchoose any jacket. (Just quietly bring the favorite along, or keep a spare<br/>\nin the car without comment). When consequences are seamlessly obvious, they<br/>\nneed not be mentioned. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this created life follwing this leap, the thought processes behind<br/>\nchoices can be unsullied by the suspicion that the parents are trying to<br/>\nmanage and control (or just bullshitting). It becomes about a parent not<br/>\nbeing emotionally attached to the free advice they are able to give when<br/>\nasked, by children who actually trust their parents to express only truthful<br/>\nand plausible misgivings, and help brainstorm around those problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means that the parents get to own and express their own varying comfort<br/>\nlevels, without the rigid concept of &quot;setting limits&quot;. It means that the<br/>\nchildren don&#39;t have to constantly look for the delineation of those limits<br/>\nand test their validity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInsomniac Musings <br/>\n<br/>\nQuote ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
