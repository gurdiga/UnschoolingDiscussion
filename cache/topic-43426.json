It would make some pretty important <br/>\naspects of a child&#39;s life very confusing to keep a secret like that! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did they keep it a secret?  I asked my Mom that one time and she just <br/>\nreplied &quot;because I thought it was best for you&quot;.  Mostly I think it was a secret <br/>\nbecause my bio dad never agreed to me being taken away and adopted and my <br/>\nfamily knew him and I went to live several States away to prevent him from knowing <br/>\napparently.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow unfit would it have been for an unwed FATHER to raise a child in the <br/>\nearly 1960&#39;s?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did they keep the secret?  Apparently because everyone thought I KNEW and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow was the secret revealed?  Other than my &quot;dad&quot; in younger years in rages <br/>\nof punishment telling me I could never be his child (which I never thought <br/>\nmeant I really WASN&#39;T) and I&#39;d ask my mother about it later and she said he meant <br/>\nnothing by it...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my late twenties I got sick, very sick.  I had an undiagnosed liver <br/>\nfailure.  The doctors said there were about 80 different diseases with a genetic <br/>\naspect that would cause this.  He wanted a family history of ANY liver problem.  <br/>\nI asked my mother she said there were none anywhere in the family.  It was <br/>\nThanksgiving, at my house, I heard my parents in a heated argument in the <br/>\nbathroom but couldn&#39;t tell what the problem was.  The next day my adopted dad called <br/>\nmy DH to come visit him at work.  There he said &quot;her mother would rather her <br/>\ndie than tell her the truth&quot;, &quot;the truth is that I am not her father, and I <br/>\nwill tell you who is&quot;.  My Aunt that lived in MI, my birth State had already <br/>\ncontacted my father and told him what was going on.  That very day as my mother <br/>\nwalked in my front door my phone rang and a man who said he was my father, Glen <br/>\n________ wanted to know what he could do to help me.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery awkward moment.  I asked him to call back later.  I didn&#39;t say anything <br/>\nto my mother at all.  When my DH came home that evening he told me about his <br/>\nconversation with my adopted dad and verified the name of the man who had <br/>\ncalled me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all happened fairly quickly and it was very difficult at times to try to <br/>\ngrasp.  When I called the Aunt in MI to ask her what she knew about this man, <br/>\nshe was very short with me and wanted to know why I was making a &quot;big deal&quot; out <br/>\nof this, I have known this information for years and had wanted no part of <br/>\nknowing him.  It took me more than half an hour to convince her that I did NOT <br/>\nknow I was adopted and this was all knew to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on my thirtieth birthday (which I always had felt would be traumatic for <br/>\nme, for some reason it signaled OLD to me at the time) I got on an airplane, <br/>\nalone and headed for Detroit to meet the man who obviously had loved me very <br/>\nmuch for all my life.  I knew there were TV stations waiting for me on my <br/>\narrival.  The made announcements on the plane.  Several people bought me glasses of <br/>\nchampagne.  I was grateful and drunk and four hours late and I missed the TV <br/>\ncrews and am also grateful for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were great, but they had known about me all my life and loved me and I <br/>\ndid not know them.  The siblings were great and while everyone tried to put me <br/>\nat ease, it was hard for me to know how these people seemed so caring when the <br/>\nparents I was raised with weren&#39;t even like that.  I had a very hard time <br/>\nunderstanding how this could be so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for keeping a secret, I guess the best way to do that is to act like it <br/>\nisn&#39;t a secret at all maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was weird 13 years ago, it&#39;s still weird for me today.  I still can&#39;t <br/>\nfigure out what was to be gained by a secret like that.  Other than my parents <br/>\nKEEPING me, but most of the time it sure felt like I was not wanted there.

How did you parents keep that a secret?  and why?   It would make some pretty important aspects of a child&#39;s life very confusing to keep a secret like that!  I once dated a man who was 13 when he discovered his Dad was really his adoptive stepdad, and that he had a bio-dad out there.  Things got worse when he learned his bio-dad had been sending gifts and letters for years, only to have his mom return them unopened.  He felt very betrayed by her dishonesty -- to the point that he changed his last name to his bio-dad&#39;s when he turned 18, and went to live with his bio-dad.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe also gave me the best piece of advice I ever got as a divorced Mom with an uninvolved ex.  In addition to blocking all contact, his Mom went on to tell him that his bio-dad as a really bad guy.  Now, maybe he had been when they were married, but by the time Mike met him, Dad was a great guy, and they became fast friends.  Mom had zero credibility after that, and Mike had some serious trust issues (last I heard from him he and his wife were in therapy after less than 2yrs of marriage).  <br/>\n <br/>\nHis advice was to always be fair, even generous, in talking about my ex to my son, because someday he could turn out to be Mr. Wonderful.  Even if he just learned how to look like Mr. Wonderful, it would be enough to leave my son feeling like he&#39;d been lied to.  I always did my best to be fair, to explain to my oldest that we&#39;d both been responsible for the mess things were when he was born, and that I genuinely hoped someday his bio-dad would find the happiness he&#39;d never had in childhood.  As it happens, my ex doesn&#39;t even look like Mr. Wonderful, but that was something my son found out on his own, and it left him free to make his own assessments.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes the best advice comes from wounded survivors.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I never knew he <br/>\nexisted until just before my thirtieth year.  It was strange that this man I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know had pictures of me in albums of HIS family.  His children, my half <br/>\nsiblings, I DID feel very connected to right away.  It was very odd for me, <br/>\nstill is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did, however, always have dreams about some man coming to &quot;take me away&quot; to <br/>\na very nice, very pleasant place, but I thought all children had that dream.  <br/>\nMaybe I did remember him on some level as a child and that there had been a <br/>\nkind and caring man that sometimes took me to a different safe place.

Not to say we have always <br/>\nagreed on everything, or even close.  They might even have said, &quot;She is my <br/>\nadopted sister&quot; but not within my hearing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a young girl/teenager, even before I KNEW I was adopted I used to say that <br/>\nall the time to people that would say how different my sister next youngest <br/>\nto me were from each other.  I later found out why my mother cringed every time <br/>\nshe heard me say that.  She apparently would think someone had &quot;let out the <br/>\nsecret&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why it was a secret, I don&#39;t care, that&#39;s my mom&#39;s stuff to deal <br/>\nwith.  I just know from the adopted side of the fence how it would sting to <br/>\nknow that I was referred to in different words than my siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course we are all white, the birth children have black hair and dark dark <br/>\neyes and dark skin.  I have very white skin, red hair and green eyes, so to a <br/>\nbig extent I did look very different from all the other kids in the family <br/>\ntoo.  I know that can&#39;t compare with children who are completely a different <br/>\nethnicity though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also different in many many ways than any of my parents &quot;birth <br/>\nchildren&quot;.

I guess feeling like I&#39;m there while watching<br/>\nthrough the kitchen wouldn&#39;t give me the same insight as sitting among them.<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s being a bit too strict for her play. That&#39;s very possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Maybe she&#39;s just zippier and has a shorter attention span?  I&#39;m that way,<br/>\n especially in the mornings.  Does time of day matter?  Could you ask her to<br/>\ndo<br/>\n something with him first?  And maybe he&#39;s expecting half an hour and she<br/>\ncan<br/>\n only do ten minutes.   Maybe if it is a matter of attention span you could<br/>\nwarn<br/>\n him.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing here is very very true for her. She doesn&#39;t have the<br/>\nattention span that Joseph has. I didn&#39;t think that maybe he&#39;s just playing<br/>\nway too long and intensely for her. Very possible. Time of day doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter. He has asked for her to play with him first and that works for<br/>\nawhile and then it gets switched around and she blows him off again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Can you get boys over to play with him?  She shouldn&#39;t really need to be<br/>\nhis<br/>\n dependable play-buddy.  I know it&#39;s only a year or three before he might<br/>\nnot<br/>\n want her to play with him anyway, but as transition, if he&#39;s got a better<br/>\n alternative, that will give her the space she might be needing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat could be a problem too. Joseph doesn&#39;t have any friends that are just<br/>\nhis. He has a few from sports camp but it&#39;s very hard for me to get together<br/>\nwith them. They are school at homers and just don&#39;t have much *play* time<br/>\nduring the week. Weekends seem to be family time for them and us.

I&#39;m not having much luck and would love any input.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 middle children are 13 months apart. They generally get along quite well with each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past few months now, Sierra (8) has been very insensitive to Joseph (9) and his feelings. She basically blows him off when she promises him she will play what he would like to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey will each want to play different things. Sierra will get Joseph to play what she wants, promising him she will play his game after. Then when the time comes, she changes her mind. Joseph is not a cryer and she has been bringing him to tears lately. He feels like she just doesn&#39;t care about him at all. He wonders how she can be so mean to him. <br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I have tried and said so far has made no difference. Joseph will just stop playing with her to try and make her see what she&#39;s doing but eventually he will want to play with her enough to give in. Then she&#39;ll blow him off again. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to understand when I explain to her how he&#39;s feeling, but not enough to stop doing what she does. She doesn&#39;t do this with anyone else but Joseph. In fact, when she plays with groups of kids, she&#39;s the one that never has a problem with anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t seem to find a solution. She seems to not care that&#39;s it&#39;s a big deal to Joseph and he&#39;s heartbroken at least once or twice a week over this. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not like that with her at all and she hardly ever complains about anything he does to her. She loves playing with him, but when he gets upset, she&#39;ll find someone else to play with or just play alone. We&#39;re big on not making promises here just because so I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s no big deal to her. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m totally out of ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] re: siblings","postDate":"1066040039","msgId":82827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCQUZGMzI3LjFGOUQzJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJtYzVpZys0ZzBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":82814,"nextInTopic":89660,"prevInTime":82826,"nextInTime":82828,"topicId":43426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I agree that this is a tough age <br/>\ngap because their interests are so different, and reading out loud is <br/>\nespecially difficult because of varying interests and attention spans. <br/>\nHowever, mine have become very good friends -- the older guy is a <br/>\nresponsible older brother, the younger one prefers his company to anyone <br/>\nelse&#39;s, and they love to play games together (video, cards, imaginary, <br/>\nchasing, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really hard to feel like you don&#39;t have time for what everyone needs. <br/>\nThat includes kids, husband and coworkers. To say nothing of oneself -- <br/>\nanother topic altogether. I  have had to make what once seemed like major <br/>\ncompromises. When I worked at night, I used to read stories at breakfast <br/>\nbecause I wasn&#39;t home at bedtime. Today, by the time work and dinner were <br/>\nover, it was dark, but the guys wanted to go to the park so we went, in the <br/>\ndark. (It was fun -- we had it to ourselves.) Their dad is home with them <br/>\nduring the day, but of course since I&#39;ve been gone all day, there&#39;s a <br/>\nthundering race to the front door when they hear my key in the lock and then <br/>\na wrestling match to see who can hug me first (the upside of a job outside <br/>\nthe house!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you should feel bad about giving one less attention if the <br/>\nother needs more for the moment. It balances out over time. The reality is <br/>\nthat people have to satisfy their own needs sometimes and often must wait <br/>\nfor what they need. The family is an organic unit and parts  must always <br/>\naccommodate each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the younger child makes up for less parental attention with all that <br/>\nsibling attention. They learn a lot from their older siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur younger child has definitely gotten less of the concentrated attention <br/>\nthan his older sibling did. I can&#39;t say he&#39;s worse off for it. He&#39;s learned <br/>\nto find things to do on his own and he&#39;s much more self-sufficient and <br/>\neasy-going than our older one, who always seemed to need someone to help him <br/>\nfigure out how to keep busy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] siblings","postDate":"1031591251","msgId":43460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNDZNbHh2Y01yaW1scTZ2SjEwMDAwNzI5OEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43456,"nextInTopic":43687,"prevInTime":43459,"nextInTime":43461,"topicId":43426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... and the three s were far worse.

So after he napped a bit and woke up really cranky, Trevor was <br/>\nreally antsy about going up to Target to buy a gameboy game that he&#39;s been <br/>\nwanting.<br/>\nI really wanted to take him. He&#39;s been babysitting his younger sibs some and <br/>\nI really owed him anyway.<br/>\nBut here&#39;s this tired cranky baby that needs to be home. So we waited. I told <br/>\nTrevor I would have to see...that I could not go up to the store if he was <br/>\nstill cranky, and I wouldn&#39;t leave him with Daddy again since he just got me <br/>\nback after being gone at work.  It would have upset him too much if I walked <br/>\nout the door again.<br/>\nSo we fed Jalen, we waited some more, I nursed him again. And he started <br/>\nbeing less cranky. Pretty soon he was getting his shoes out (heard us talking <br/>\nabout leaving) and was ready to go. So I got to meet everyone&#39;s needs. But it <br/>\nis a balancing act.<br/>\nWhile at the store I had to put Jared off over something he wanted because I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have enough money.  I promised to buy it later this week, after <br/>\npayday. He was fine with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think with two little ones it can be harder. They do get less needy as they <br/>\nget older, or needy in different ways at least. <br/>\nDo you have any way to spend time alone with each of them weekly? This is a <br/>\nvery important thing in our house. Time alone with one parent greatly reduces <br/>\ntheir feelings of rivalry for attention.<br/>\nFind some really cool activity for one of them and deal with the one that is <br/>\nneeding you at that moment. <br/>\nRice bins are a great distractor, as is water play, bubble blowing and music.<br/>\nFill up the kitchen sink with water and dishsoap and let them put some <br/>\nkitchen tools in and play.  Water is hugely calming to a child also.<br/>\nPut on music and take turns dancing with them.<br/>\nWatch a movie together.<br/>\nGet out a pile of paper, crayons, pens, glitter glue and make art together. <br/>\nYour doing the project with them is more calming than if you leave them on <br/>\ntheir own doing it.<br/>\nHope some of this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94364,"nextTopicId":94255}}
