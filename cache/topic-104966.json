She was eating a *lot* of<br/>\njunk, especially fast food and it was getting to the<br/>\npoint where even my grandmother was starting to say<br/>\n&quot;maybe you shouldn&#39;t have that second burger,<br/>\nsweetie&quot;.  She was starting to look downright<br/>\nchunky...<br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short, over the next three months she grew<br/>\nabout 6 inches. She was *definately* not chunky after<br/>\nthat. As a matter of fact she was painfully thin<br/>\nlooking for several years.  She probably could have<br/>\nstanded to eat even more during that time when her<br/>\nbody was getting ready to grow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think generally, the body knows what it needs, if we<br/>\nare able to listen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCourtney<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nYahoo!
