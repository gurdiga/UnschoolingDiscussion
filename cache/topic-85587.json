My father-in-law has been in a <br/>\nnursing home for some time.  His Alzheimer&#39;s has also reached the <br/>\nstage where his brain no longer signals his throat to swallow, so he <br/>\nkeeps getting pneumonia.  He forgot how to walk long ago.  All agreed <br/>\nto sign a DNR order and not to continue a feeding tube, which made <br/>\nhim eligible for the hospice wing of the nursing home.  In truth he <br/>\nis getting much better treatment there, but we expect he, too, will <br/>\nnot make it through the end of the year.  We visited him last week, a <br/>\nlong drive.  But we figure it may be the last time we see him alive.  <br/>\nI will hold you and your family in our prayerful and healing thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"if you&#39;re so inclined...will you pray?","postDate":"1070161982","msgId":85587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMTMwMDMxMzAyLjQ5NDgucW1haWxAd2ViMTI2MDYubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":85588,"prevInTime":85586,"nextInTime":85588,"topicId":85587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you re so inclined, will you please pray for me and my family?
