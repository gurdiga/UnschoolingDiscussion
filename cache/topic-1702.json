Schooling seems to be a never ending topic there.  <br/>\nsome parents are unschooling or home schooling but the posts related <br/>\nto schooling are typically the frustrations of the parents in the <br/>\nproblems they are facing with their spirited children in the school <br/>\nsystems.  It certainly reinforces my belief that I would be making <br/>\nthe right decision to unschool Sterling.  Whether it&#39;s parenting or <br/>\nschooling at home, there are frustrations and issues specific to <br/>\nunderstanding and dealing with the temperament of the spirited child.<br/>\nOur group focuses on sharing those frustrations and strategies to <br/>\nhelp resolve the difficulties and encourage positive responses. <br/>\n<br/>\n   You can visit the discussion group URL listed below for psk in my <br/>\nsignature line to get more info or subscribe.  or send a blank email <br/>\nto <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psk-subscribe@egroups.com\">psk-subscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\nI hope this does not come across as advertising inappropriate for <br/>\nthis group but hope to just provide another support resource for <br/>\nparents who have chosen to unschool their child and might be having <br/>\nthe additional challenge of their child&#39;s intensity, persistance, <br/>\ntransition difficulties, energy level, sensitivity (environmental, <br/>\nphysical, and emotional), distractibility, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1713,"nextTopicId":1709}}
