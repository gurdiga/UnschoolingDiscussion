That is a pretty<br/>\naccurate descitption of my younger daughter&#39;s feet.  I have arches but<br/>\nstarted getting bunions when I was 20.  They are really odd shaped now. <br/>\nThe ball of my foot (just behind the toes) is nearly twice as wide as the<br/>\nheal!  Anyway, I found a pair of shoes that is wonderful.  From the<br/>\nminute I put them on, they felt great!  The brand is Merrell and they are<br/>\ncalled &#39;ladies moccasin&#39; But they are not a moc in the traditional sense.<br/>\nOne other suggestion, if your feet are like Jenni&#39;s, don&#39;t be shy about<br/>\ntrying on men&#39;s shoes.  They usually fit her feet better than the women&#39;s<br/>\nshoes do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget - whose daughters bought matching MEN&#39;S hiking boots last week. <br/>\nIt is way more scary that they bought matching shoes than that they<br/>\nbought them in the men&#39;s department!  They never do anything alike, ever!<br/>\n The world is spinning in reverse now or something!<br/>\n<br/>\n~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~<br/>\nThink like a man of action, act like a man of thought<br/>\n<br/>\n                     - Henri Bergson</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26208,"nextTopicId":26211}}
