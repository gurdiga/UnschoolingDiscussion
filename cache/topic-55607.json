I have handled the higher energy but have a harder time with the aggressive beh. as he really has his self esteem impacted because it is often beyond his control to moderate his behavior. He is seven and over the years we have seen that honey has a less drastic impact on his body so this becomes more of a choice.<br/>\n  I have really struggled with the food restriction choice because I do see the boomerang affect on them wanting everything. My dilema has been the reactions that everyone of my children experience. Their allergic reactions vary such as ear infections and vomiting from milk. They monitor themselves easily. Eczema they are more likely to indulge. I did not like to see the food issue problems that restricting creates for them so I have been working to balance the amount of discomfort I go thru when they eat sugar, wheat, and food colring which are the worst culprits with their need to eat freely. They are aware of my concerns and my need for not always having to do doctors, naturopaths or homeopathy to aid their weak immune systems and now we are starting to find a mutual balance. Our next challenge is that two for sure have thyroid malfunctions and we are working with the naturopath ,after years of knowing something was off, to finally find a treatment. This means my 2 kids are being asked to limit their carb intake as it really stresses an already stressed adrenal and thyriod system.The challenge is to do this without disrespecting and depriving anyone to the point of shame or emotional damage.<br/>\n  So I guess my real point is that their are many circumstances that motivate us to makee our choices in life<br/>\n  Working hard in bc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n  &quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
