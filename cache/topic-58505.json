Most of us enjoy having<br/>\n  some sort of routine built in to our day. We get up, have a cup of<br/>\n  coffee, eat, play, read, work, whatever. That&#39;s much, much different<br/>\n  from having a contrived structure imposed on us. I think any child<br/>\n  will feel good in a loving family with a gentle, happy routine. Our<br/>\n  routines include time to watch TV, time to read (or be read to), time<br/>\n  to create, time to move, etc. It&#39;s not the same every day, but it has<br/>\n  a sense of flow and familiarity.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you mind if I ask what kind of special needs are you talking<br/>\n  about, Sheila?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;Anne (AnneO) Ohman and Mary (Zenmomma) Gold and Lisa Bugg/Miriam<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  have written extensively about special needs and how UNschooling---<br/>\n  the lifestyle---is the best option for the child to be &quot;himself&quot; and<br/>\n  not some form of being the parent would like for him to be.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  The thing is, all we can ever be is ourselves. Think about that for a<br/>\n  minute, because it&#39;s really important. It&#39;s not our job to *fix* our<br/>\n  special needs kids. It&#39;s our job to understand them and help them to<br/>\n  understand themselves. It&#39;s our job to help them to learn and to *be*<br/>\n  in their own unique way. It&#39;s our job to let them follow their own<br/>\n  path as they mature into their grown selves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we allow our children to lead the way, to set the pace, they will<br/>\n  lead *us* on an adventure of learning, doing and being. I have<br/>\n  learned soooo much by being with my kids and working to understand<br/>\n  them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Remember too, that the routines of a real life won&#39;t look like<br/>\n  school. It will look like life. And in the midst of living that life,<br/>\n  there will be learning. Guaranteed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Life is good.<br/>\n  ~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

After three years of seesawing between their bio parents and our home, they became our adopted children.  Our older son is 14 and came to us just before his 8th birthday.  He had been with parents who were in an extremely dysfunctional relationship and who abused both drugs and alcohol.  His younger brother was born cocaine exposed which is what brought them into the child welfare system.<br/>\nThe abuse and neglect which my older son experienced, as well as prenatal alcohol exposure, has left him very emotionally damaged and with very hard to categorize but increasingly recognizable brain damage.  He is also 14!  He has a whole line of alphabet diagnoses(FAS,ADHD, PTSD, Depression, Obsessive/compulsive tendencies as well as sexual abuse) which aren&#39;t very helpful in explaining this complicated soul who lives in our house but resists being part of our home.  We continue to try to have him realize that he is part of a family where he is loved and protected.  Unfortunately, he has many understandable barriers to such realization.  Formal school institutions, both public and private, with specialized IEPs and within the mainstream, just didn&#39;t want him.  Our younger son (his brother) came to us at 4 months.  He has been diagnosed as ARND (Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder) but does not have the behavior/social problems of his older brother.  We kept him home after K for many reasons but mostly in order to prevent the devastating effect on his self esteem which happend to his brother in a system which did not have the time or resources to address his particular problems.  We took our older son out after this past Christmas when it became apparent that the IEP was a joke and that he was just tuning out/dropping out when he was not involved in behavioral episodes.<br/>\nI had naturally evolved to a more relaxed approach to homeschooling with my younger son just because it felt right. Now that our older son is home, I&#39;m not quite sure what to do.  There is so much sibling rivalry despite the difference in their ages since Michael, our older son, is often more developmentally close to 6 years old, that it is difficult to leave the two boys in the same room.  Michael is also still caught up in &quot;getting the right answer&quot; that it is difficult to enjoy anything.  He makes everything a competition.  My younger son wants me to play a game with him right now (and we also have a 3 year old foster daughter who needs attention) so I find it very difficult to keep up on this board but I want the wisdom of your experiences!<br/>\nI also have problems re: TV and computer with our boys.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong but they both seem much less &quot;humanly&quot; attached after time in front of screens and with button-pushing (my bias is showing but it&#39;s true).  My husband and I have theorized that it is an easier world for them to navigate than the complex one of human relationships.  For kids with attachment problems (substitute alcohol damage), I think these things are lethal.  Michael wants friends and does not know how to get or keep them.  Relating to a machine only seems to make it harder for him.  I&#39;m trying to accept who he is but it is difficult when he has such low self-esteem and is often very unlikable.<br/>\nHelp,<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: zenmomma2kids &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, February 12, 2003 12:47 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: does unschooling work for everyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Talk about serendipity....I was just logging back on to this list <br/>\n  after a long break and the first message I read has my name in it. <br/>\n  Guess it was just the right time for me to reconnect back here at <br/>\n  unschooling-dotcom. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;I&#39;m new to homeschooling 2 &quot;special needs&quot; kids and am having some <br/>\n  problems trying to embrace the wholehearted unschooling lifestyle <br/>\n  espoused here since there does seem to be a need for structure that I <br/>\n  don&#39;t think is just my need.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  There was just a discussion on the message boards about the <br/>\n  difference between structure and routine.

I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d say that it doesn&#39;t work. My kid is <br/>\na &quot;special needs&quot; kid, having fairly severe SID (sensory integration <br/>\ndysfunction), and there are a lot of things we&#39;ve worked with him on <br/>\nto deal with that, but we&#39;ve tried to work within what he is <br/>\ncomfortable with, and talk with him about them so that nothing is <br/>\nbeing done *to him*. For instance, while most kids just learn to do <br/>\nsimple motor skills like dress themselves, his motor planning is/was <br/>\nso off that he just wasn&#39;t getting it. So, when he asks for help in <br/>\ndressing, I give it to him, but I also explain what I&#39;m doing in <br/>\nwords so that he can process it and figure out how to translate that <br/>\ninto bodily action. For instance, I might say &quot;When you have to <br/>\nbalance to put on your jeans, you can sit on the edge of the bed or <br/>\nbathtub.&quot; Before I mentioned that, he would literally try to stand <br/>\non one leg and then fall over, and he would just keep repeating <br/>\nthat, becoming frustrated that it didn&#39;t work. Is it <br/>\nnot &quot;unschooling&quot; that I have to give him more information to do a <br/>\ntask than most people need? My daughter just figures these things <br/>\nout, my son seems to need to hear verbally how to do something. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine withholding information from him that helps him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, when we saw how many problems he was having in every day <br/>\nlife (like not being able to brush teeth, comb hair, go in places <br/>\nthat were too light or too noisy, walk on surfaces that were too <br/>\nsoft or too hard or too fuzzy, or whatever, wear almost any kind of <br/>\nclothes or shoes, walk without tripping, sit on a chair without <br/>\nfalling off), we sat down and talked it over with him and suggested <br/>\ngoing to OT (occupational therapy). We told him exactly what it was, <br/>\nand how it might help him out. He really loved going to visit Molly, <br/>\nhis therapist, and play there. The therapy helped re-wire his brain <br/>\nso that these things no longer bother him to the extreme that they <br/>\nonce did, allowing him to function in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that parenting him has given me a much greater <br/>\nappreciation for how incredibly differently kids can learn. I can <br/>\nsee how there might be a point at which unschooling wouldn&#39;t work. <br/>\nWho among us can put ourselves in the shoes of the parent of a non-<br/>\nverbal autistic kid and say with certainty what we would or would <br/>\nnot do? Would trying to reach a child like that with therapy be not <br/>\nconsidered unschooling, if the child could not verbally or <br/>\nnonverbally communicate or give consent? I don&#39;t know. I can only <br/>\nsay that unschooling has worked for myself in our situation - that <br/>\nwe&#39;ve found a way to honor the ways in which our child is different <br/>\nwhile still trying to help him work through the ways that his <br/>\ndifferentness made his life miserable and unworkable. And we always <br/>\nstrive to do that while honoring his own feelings and wishes for <br/>\nwhat is happening with his body and mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] does unschooling work for everyone?","postDate":"1045001623","msgId":58508,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYi4yMjkwOWI0YS4yYjdhY2Y5N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58507,"nextInTopic":58521,"prevInTime":58507,"nextInTime":58509,"topicId":58505,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/11/2003 4:45:32 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
