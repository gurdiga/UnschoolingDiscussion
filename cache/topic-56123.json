The council changed Jesus from <br/>\n&gt; man <br/>\n&gt; to God in the flesh, they changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, and <br/>\n&gt; the Passover was changed to Easter. So what does this say about the Bible? <br/>\n&gt; It <br/>\n&gt; says that MEN, not god, composed the Bible.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would hope that parents are helping their children to gain a more nuanced <br/>\nunderstanding of history than this kind of statement represents.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example, if they read that Emperor Constantine was not baptized until <br/>\nhis death bed, is the point brought out that he was a Christian catechumen?  <br/>\nAs a &quot;student&quot; Christian he was not a pagan.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did Constantine convene a council of the whole church throughout the <br/>\nRoman Empire?  (The word &quot;catholic,&quot; by the way, means &quot;according to the <br/>\nwhole.&quot;)  He banked on using Christianity to renovate the Roman Empire, and <br/>\ntherefore thought the bishops had to get their act together since there <br/>\nseemed to be disagreements among and within the local churches in various <br/>\ncities and provinces.  So he convened the first ecumenical (empire-wide) <br/>\ncouncil of all the bishops of the church and asked them to set forth the <br/>\nbeliefs and practices of the church.  In the process they produced a creed <br/>\nthat was constructed by comparing all the baptismal professions of faith used <br/>\nin the local churches.  They produced a canon of Scripture by comparing the <br/>\nbooks read in the local Christian assemblies.   In the battle against <br/>\ngnosticism Christian assemblies had already agreed to four canonical gospels <br/>\nand excluded gospels they regarded as gnostic.  They accepted the canon of <br/>\nOld Testament books that the Jewish rabbis had already established, although <br/>\nthey changed the order in the Old Testament so that the prophetic books came <br/>\nlast.  They believed that all of these books in the Old and now in the <br/>\ncanonized New Testaments were inspired.  The bishops affirmed the doctrine of <br/>\nthe Trinity (which necessarily includes the co-divinity of Christ with the <br/>\nFather and the Holy Spirit) by appealing to the statements in the gospels and <br/>\nepistles and the devotional practices of their people.  Confessing one God in <br/>\nthree co-equal persons excluded the Arians who taught that the Son was <br/>\nsubordinate to the Father.  They synchronized the Christian calender <br/>\nthroughout the Empire by agreeing that the Pascha (later called &quot;Easter&quot; by <br/>\nthe Anglo-Saxons) should be observed on the first Sunday after the first full <br/>\nmoon of spring and not on the 14th of Nisan, as the Christians of Asia Minor <br/>\nhad been doing.  So Rome won on this one. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the Council Constantine decreed that Sunday would be a day of rest <br/>\nthroughout the Empire.  That meant that sabbath ideas were transferred to the <br/>\nLord&#39;s Day.  But catholic Christianity has always understood that the Lord&#39;s <br/>\nDay and the Sabbath are two different days.  In the Latin church calendar <br/>\nSaturday is still called &quot;Sabbato&quot; (&quot;of rest&quot;) and Sunday is called &quot;Dominca&quot; <br/>\n(&quot;of the Lord&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would hope that homeschoolers would learn to understand the dynamics at <br/>\nwork in history, and not just facts which, in and of themselves, might not be <br/>\ntrue. or conclusions which usually, in the study of history, are untrue.  As <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to indicate by the above discussion---as an illustration of this <br/>\nprinciple---it simply would not be true that Constantine remained a pagan or <br/>\nthat he turned Sunday into the Sabbath.  The reality was more complicated <br/>\nthan that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank and Mary, lurkers until now, parents of 3, one still homeschooling, <br/>\nlearning tons on this list<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56119,"nextTopicId":55759}}
