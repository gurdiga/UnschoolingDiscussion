The ps teacher trainer was a<br/>\ntrained Eurythmy teacher who decided to bring this way of learning to the ps<br/>\nschool they had the funding for it in the inner city and apparently it has<br/>\nmade a big difference there. I think Detroit but I could be wrong. I forgot<br/>\nher name and the city but they were also doing it also in Manhattan but can<br/>\ntry and find my notes. It was a real eye opener as to how music and rhythm<br/>\nand movement can be used to develop the mind and body at the same time. Even<br/>\nthough it was obvious that her training was quite extensive it seemed to me<br/>\nthat anyone with a music, movement or dance background could really pick up<br/>\non it and use it with their children. Even on the most elementary level. I<br/>\ndabbled in all the Waldorf stuff they taught esp. storytelling and painting<br/>\nso I didn&#39;t pay as much attention but the songs I learned from that<br/>\nwonderful teacher are still in my brain.<br/>\nThe concepts of integrating the whole person to teach or learn are<br/>\nfascinating to me. When I went to college @Lesley Graduate school I did<br/>\nstudy Integrating the Arts into the Curriculum. It has always been important<br/>\nto me. It certainly doesn&#39;t have to be limited to a Waldorf subject such as<br/>\nEurythmy. Mara&#39;s example just reminded me of what I had seen/experienced<br/>\nwhen I was there. Are there any Eurythmy teachers who would work with<br/>\nhschoolers to your knowledge?
