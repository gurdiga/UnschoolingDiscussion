I have 3 kids: Jade (b)7, Zoe (g) 4.5 & Savitri (g) 8<br/>\n&gt;weeks. We live in West Linn, OR which is on the outskirts of Portland.  I<br/>\n&gt;value unschooling along with other aspects of natural living (eating raw<br/>\n&gt;foods, unassisted childbirth, extended breastfeeding, natural healing, <br/>\n&gt;etc.)<br/>\n&gt;   I unschooled until last year when I decided to put Jade in 1st grade.  I<br/>\n&gt;had been unable to figure out his interests & I could see how bored he was <br/>\n&gt;&<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s been resentful of his sister since she was born.  So I thought school<br/>\n&gt;might give him something all his own & feed his outgoing social nature.  I<br/>\n&gt;hoped we&#39;d see an improvement in his negative behavior. He was behind<br/>\n&gt;everyone but caught up once he got into the groove. He started by <br/>\n&gt;memorizing<br/>\n&gt;& then it seems like he figured out how to process info in his brain & is<br/>\n&gt;really loving learning.  But there&#39;s all the negative social/behavioral<br/>\n&gt;effects of being in school that will only get worse as he goes up in <br/>\n&gt;grades.<br/>\n&gt;His negative behavior hasn&#39;t changed a bit & now he&#39;s added some other<br/>\n&gt;negative habits as well. He knows I&#39;m not putting him in next year but <br/>\n&gt;he&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;finish up the year. He seems okay with it. I honestly don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;handle him. He doesn&#39;t give me very good cues about his interests. He also<br/>\n&gt;drains me quickly & he always has. I am already overwhelmed just with my <br/>\n&gt;4yo<br/>\n&gt;at home with a newborn. The baby doesn&#39;t suck right so I am pumping milk <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;her around the clock. This really limits my ability to go places & to <br/>\n&gt;engage<br/>\n&gt;with the 4yo for any period of time becuase the time in between pumps <br/>\n&gt;always<br/>\n&gt;seems filled with making food, cleaning up, showers, brushing teeth, <br/>\n&gt;running<br/>\n&gt;errands. I make beautiful food & beautiful children but other than that I<br/>\n&gt;lack creativity & don&#39;t think I&#39;m much fun as a mom. Of course I&#39;ve spent a<br/>\n&gt;lot of my time as a mom pregnant & peuking (4.5 pregnancies) or exhausted<br/>\n&gt;from nursing every 3 hours (5+ years). I&#39;m not complaining, but rather just<br/>\n&gt;trying to put myself out there & see if any of you can relate & how you&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;handled it. The other major challenge I should mention is money. It seems<br/>\n&gt;we&#39;re always just scraping by & borrowing money (pre-spending)just to have<br/>\n&gt;food in the house.  To offer them more fullness in life I&#39;d like to be able<br/>\n&gt;to afford books, toys, museums, etc that they&#39;re interested in.  My <br/>\n&gt;seasonal<br/>\n&gt;allergies have really gotten in the way of all the nature things I&#39;d like <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;do also.  I hope I don&#39;t come across as grossly negative, I&#39;m just a tired,<br/>\n&gt;overwhelmed mama who wants to give them all I can & I&#39;m looking for ideas,<br/>\n&gt;support, encouragement, etc.  Glad you&#39;re all out there giving this gift to<br/>\n&gt;your children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Blessings,<br/>\n&gt;Sara J.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":91586765,"authorName":"donabak","from":"&quot;donabak&quot; &lt;donabak@...&gt;","profile":"donabak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Intro from Sara J.","postDate":"1015025787","msgId":32196,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE1cDM5citwZmR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzAxLjExMzAxMS4tMTQ2MzExLjAuYnNvbGxhcnNAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32195,"nextInTopic":32222,"prevInTime":32195,"nextInTime":32197,"topicId":32189,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A good book I am recommending ... and ...

I live in Springfield-Eugene area of Oregon.  I<br/>\nalso am interested in raw foodism, although I seem to do it for seasons<br/>\nat a time separated by times of eating cooked foods.  I first was turned<br/>\non to it a couple of years ago.  I have four kids, and it&#39;s been a while<br/>\nsince I had them as young as yours, but I can relate to your feelings.  I<br/>\nhope you will see that you are a good mom and it is okay to be tired and<br/>\ndiscouraged now and then throughout motherhood.  As for boredom, since<br/>\nstarting to unschool all my kids, which is only this last year, when they<br/>\nget bored and come to me to entertain them, my &quot;mantra&quot; is &quot;boredom. is.<br/>\nthe soil.  in which.  imagination.  grows.&quot;  And since I&#39;ve not been<br/>\nfeeling so obligated to entertain them, they have learned to use their<br/>\nminds to find their own interests.  Now occasionally, my seven y.o.<br/>\ndaughter comes to me and says, &quot;You&#39;re right mom, when I am bored my mind<br/>\nstarts thinking about things.&quot;  It&#39;s my job to offer them things and<br/>\ntheir job to decide what to pursue or not.  Then, it&#39;s my job to listen<br/>\nand  not hinder them from pursuing their interests.  Surely your son has<br/>\nsome interests.  What did he do when he was at home?  What does he do now<br/>\nin his spare time?  That is his interest.  A good book I am recommending<br/>\nright now is How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will<br/>\nTalk.  I don&#39;t know the author.  But I got it at the local library and<br/>\ntook notes.  It&#39;s really made my job as a mom easier and has improved my<br/>\nrelationship with my children, and even with my husband(big kid).  To<br/>\nkeep your son from draining you, you might consider how much and at what<br/>\ntimes you want to devote just to him.  Then he won&#39;t expect your<br/>\nattention at times when you need to give it to baby or to resting, but<br/>\nwill be secure knowing certain times are just for him.  Anyhow,  it<br/>\nsounds like you are a bit overwhelmed with finances and children.  I have<br/>\nbeen there before and still am at times.  Sometimes it helps me to sit<br/>\ndown and pray the serenity prayer and make a list of what I can change<br/>\nand what I cannot change.
