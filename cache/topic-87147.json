Now that my daughter is 2 1/2, I <br/>\nhave started thinking about potty training and I&#39;m stuck.  Part of <br/>\nme feels like I should go out and buy the pull ups and &quot;teach&quot; her <br/>\nhow to use the potty.  But, I think that she does know how to use it <br/>\nand is just not interested in trying right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did buy her her own potty a while back and she has certainly <br/>\nwatched me enough times.  Sometimes she&#39;ll go and sit on her potty <br/>\n(while I&#39;m in there) and tell me that she&#39;s using the potty, just <br/>\nlike me.  She even flushes it (her&#39;s has a fake flusher on it).  So, <br/>\nmost of the time, I think, just let her learn when she&#39;s ready.  <br/>\nBut, then sometimes I hear (in my head) &quot;people&quot; saying she&#39;s 3 1/2 <br/>\nor 4 and not potty trained yet?!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds to me like a little girl who is exactly on track with her own<br/>\npotty learning. Try and lose the word training from your thinking and you<br/>\nare well on track. Also there are many and plenty of youngsters who are not<br/>\nseeming to do anything until they are 4, then suddenly seem to learn it all<br/>\novernight. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is four and completely moved from cloth diapers to using the adult<br/>\ncommode all the time, from about 2 ½ to about 3 ½ (no dyedee at night)<br/>\nabsolutely painlessly without any effort from me. She began just as you are<br/>\ndescribing (bar the flush action). Next she would use the potty before we<br/>\nwent swimming through her swimsuit, at my invitation. We were away from home<br/>\nat the time with my mother going through an illness, so I was surprised that<br/>\nshe wanted to start the process  her life being disrupted and all. When we<br/>\ngot home in to our apartment, I would ask her whether she wanted to be<br/>\nwithout her diaper for a while. I would move the potty around the house to<br/>\nwhatever room we were in, and show her how to pour it out  usually she<br/>\nasked me to do it anyway. She would tell me that she had poo-poo in her<br/>\nbutt and then run to her potty. I guess we would have about one accident<br/>\na week, or less. Slowly the potty moved from in any room to the hallway, and<br/>\nfinally the bathroom again. We used diapers when we went out, and then<br/>\nstarted leaving them at home, but taking our potty in the car. She seemed to<br/>\ngo from needing the diapers to simply telling me she wanted to peepee very<br/>\nquickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still used a diaper at night, and towards the end of that she would wake<br/>\nup dry, and use her diaper when she awoke  giggling about it sometimes. I<br/>\nstarted asking her whether she wanted a diaper or not, or taking it off<br/>\nfirst thing, so she became used to going into the bathroom a little while<br/>\nafter waking. There was a brief period of confusion for her about whether<br/>\nshe had her panties or her diaper on  but this only lasted a few nights. We<br/>\nused a couple of washable bedliners (rather than disposable) from Bed, Bath<br/>\nand Beyond to protect our mattress. She has wet the bed once in the last<br/>\nfour or five months.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we did not use were pull ups (another invention of the disposable<br/>\ndiaper industry), rewards, punishments, or any other numerous strategies<br/>\nfrom Potty train your child overnight! experts. She still announces her<br/>\nintention to go to the bathroom, although less often. She refuses to use<br/>\nsmall commodes, in the places where kid size ones are available  saying she<br/>\nis a big girl now and will use the big potty. The only help she still<br/>\nrequires of me is wiping her butt  on the occasions where that is<br/>\nnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may find more acceptance of late (although your daughter is not by any<br/>\nstandards late) potty learning amongst other homeschoolers than the public<br/>\nat large. Find a local park day type group now. Jayn has been going to our<br/>\nlocal group since she was 18 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I think once she gets the idea, she&#39;ll &quot;train&quot; quickly and easily, like my oldest did. <br/>\n <br/>\nConsidering that the only NEED for Logan to be pottytrained at this time is for our convenience in not having 3 children in diapers, since he will NOT be going to preschool or Head Start or anything...I&#39;m doing my best to not consider him behind or anything. I highly doubt he&#39;ll still be in diapers when he&#39;s 5 or 6. Right now, it&#39;s not that big of a deal. Inconvenient...somewhat, but that&#39;s my problem and not his. He&#39;ll have times where he&#39;ll ask for underpants, and times he wants a pullup. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf he&#39;s 6 and still in a pullup, I might consult a doctor to make sure he doesn&#39;t have any physical problems, but at this point...I&#39;m not going to rush it. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf Meggie gets &quot;trained&quot; before he does, that might spur him into it.

I&#39;m much<br/>\nmore concerned with how my kids feel about how I treat them than with what<br/>\n&#39;people&#39; think (I&#39;m sure you are too).   The next time you hear those voices<br/>\nreplace them with your daughter&#39;s voice.  She&#39;s the one who matters here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve done your part.  You&#39;ve created an environment where she can learn in<br/>\nher own time.  Now you need to trust her to do so.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling and potty training","postDate":"1072821002","msgId":87151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzEyMzAxMzQ2MzkuMDI1ZTI1MTBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGJzc29obStkaTUxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGJzc29obStkaTUxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":87147,"nextInTopic":87157,"prevInTime":87150,"nextInTime":87152,"topicId":87147,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My grandson (16 mos.) found a ziplock <br/>\nbag the other day and deposited his poop in it. (not that way - with his <br/>\nhands) Then he took it to the toilet and made a delightful mess dunking it <br/>\nin and out. My daughter is trying hard to see this as progress, and I&#39;m <br/>\njust glad it isn&#39;t me having to clean it up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nAll my kids seemed to &quot;get it&quot; around 3 or 3 1/2.

I went to public school for 12 <br/>\nyears and am really tring to disconnect from that way <br/>\nof &quot;teaching.&quot;  I love the idea of letting her learn on her own and <br/>\nexploring the world around her.  I know that I always learned things <br/>\nmuch more throughly when it was somthing that I wanted to learn <br/>\nabout and was allowed to do my own research on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo get to the point of this post.  Now that my daughter is 2 1/2, I <br/>\nhave started thinking about potty training and I&#39;m stuck.  Part of <br/>\nme feels like I should go out and buy the pull ups and &quot;teach&quot; her <br/>\nhow to use the potty.  But, I think that she does know how to use it <br/>\nand is just not interested in trying right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did buy her her own potty a while back and she has certainly <br/>\nwatched me enough times.  Sometimes she&#39;ll go and sit on her potty <br/>\n(while I&#39;m in there) and tell me that she&#39;s using the potty, just <br/>\nlike me.  She even flushes it (her&#39;s has a fake flusher on it).  So, <br/>\nmost of the time, I think, just let her learn when she&#39;s ready.  <br/>\nBut, then sometimes I hear (in my head) &quot;people&quot; saying she&#39;s 3 1/2 <br/>\nor 4 and not potty trained yet?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry if this has nothing to do with unschooling and I shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe posting it but, I wanted to get some other opinions on this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87467,"nextTopicId":87519}}
