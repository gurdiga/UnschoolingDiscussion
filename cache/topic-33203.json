Power went out and then I retrieved all the ones I wanted <br/>\nto respond to and then again. Since time is short here tonight, I&#39;m going <br/>\nto try to remember some of the questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nyes, I&#39;m sure some of the kids choose to be there. I&#39;m sure some of them <br/>\nare there becasue parents work and they can&#39;t stay home. Some of them are <br/>\nprobably there from single parent households. Some have no choice in the <br/>\nmatter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t answer how or why the students are all there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe campus is open. They can choose to leave whenever they want although <br/>\nsome of the parents have their own rules. Mostly for the younger ones. <br/>\nCan your 5yo unschooler do that at home? Can they just walk out the door <br/>\nand leave? What a scary thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttendence is what is required by law. If you can find away around this, <br/>\nI&#39;m sure they would welcome hearing this. As a NY resident, I am required <br/>\nto &#39;teach&#39; my son the same cirriculum that ps do for 5 hours a day. I am <br/>\nbound by the law, even if I choose to be creative with it. The school is <br/>\nas creative as they can be considering the legalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can come, sign in and leave. They can do this for the entire year if <br/>\nthey choose. Most choose to stick around because there is so much <br/>\nactivity and &#39;doing&#39; going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if they want to be called an &#39;unschool&#39;. They are a &#39;free&#39; <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son attended Cedarwood Sudbury in Santa Clara, CA, because as a <br/>\nsingle parent that was the next best option, they didn&#39;t think of <br/>\nthemselves as unschoolers.. or anything associated with Holt. I heard of <br/>\nGreenberg long before I heard of Holt, even though they have many <br/>\nideologies that cross paths.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there were any other question, I&#39;ll be sure to field them when we get <br/>\nback next week sometime.<br/>\n<br/>\nkolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Never ask a man what computer he uses. <br/>\nIf it&#39;s a Mac, he&#39;ll tell you.
