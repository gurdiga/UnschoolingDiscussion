The truth is that some children are never noticed and although<br/>\nkids are abused in hs and ps settings, making all kids go to ps just to<br/>\ncatch those that could possibly be abused is not the answer either.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-It&#39;s true that it would be better for the molester not to have his<br/>\nchild<br/>\ngo to school . less of a chance of detection.  I get that.  I just don&#39;t<br/>\nwant the media and the schools saying that by homeschooling we are not<br/>\nallowing our children the safety net of public schooling catching child<br/>\nabuse.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-You know it&#39;s true but you don&#39;t want it said? How can you have<br/>\nboth?-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI am not saying I didn&#39;t want it said.  I am saying that I don&#39;t like<br/>\nthe media pushing the idea that hs&#39;ing itself is done to hide child<br/>\nabuse by a majority.  The point they push is that hs&#39;ers need to be<br/>\nheavily regulated by the ps system and home visits and that would<br/>\nprevent these problems (the safety net talked about in the show).<br/>\nThat&#39;s like saying if I put a 3-legged dog in a cage, I can keep an eye<br/>\non it to make sure nothing happens to it. If you take away the rights of<br/>\nhs&#39;ers to hs without heavy regulation on the chance that some of those<br/>\nhs&#39;ers are doing it to hide child abuse, what good does that do for the<br/>\nothers that are fine?  Using your example, does taking a child out of<br/>\nschool for a week due to child abuse mean that three other families need<br/>\nto be investigated because they took their children on extended<br/>\nvacations?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong of the media to share the good<br/>\nstories and bad stories, I think there needs to be a better balance.<br/>\nBetween the news story that ran a few months ago and the Law & Order<br/>\nshow the other night, hs&#39;ers are not getting a balanced showing (for<br/>\nlack of a better word).  I don&#39;t want extremes, my desire is balance.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-How many children who were molested went through ps and graduated<br/>\nwithout anyone ever knowing the truth?  We&#39;ll probably never know. -=-<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-We definitely will never know.  But a school employee who knows of<br/>\nONE case <br/>\nhas reason to suspect there might be others.  A famous logic example is<br/>\nto consider whether all dogs have four legs.  No, <br/>\nsome dogs for one reason or another only have three legs.  You only need<br/>\nto <br/>\nknow of ONE three-legged dog to prove that not all dogs have four legs.<br/>\nBut <br/>\nhaving seen one three legged dog, it would be unreasonable to say &quot;All<br/>\ndogs except <br/>\none have four legs.&quot;-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nMy point was the same as yours in that there is never just one isolated<br/>\ncase for anything (abuse or 3 legged dogs).  You don&#39;t need to know that<br/>\nchild abuse exists to know that people of all walks of life are abusers.<br/>\nAgain, a balance.  I don&#39;t believe that more restrictions on how we hs<br/>\nand having in-home visits (an idea I&#39;ve heard from ps teachers) is the<br/>\nanswer.  I do not propose to have all the answers as to how I would like<br/>\nto balance it out.  <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt; How do you fix the problem of abuse itself?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Nobody ever will.  My concern in this discussion is the abuse of<br/>\ntruth and of <br/>\nrational thought.  We can&#39;t stop that altogether either, but we can<br/>\npoint at <br/>\nit when we see it.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat is the abuse of truth and rational thought that you are pointing<br/>\nat?  <br/>\n <br/>\nRheta<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":168226802,"authorName":"Susan Van Cleave","from":"&quot;Susan Van Cleave&quot; &lt;sdwvancleave@...&gt;","profile":"sdwvancleave","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Law & Order","postDate":"1077297556","msgId":91218,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTUtREFWMTV5aDgya1F0QVEwMDAwYTgzY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwLjIzMDJkOGQyLjJkNjcwODhiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":91210,"nextInTopic":91220,"prevInTime":91217,"nextInTime":91219,"topicId":91195,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Even reasoning that the more people who come into contact with an abused child will be able to detect the abuse, that does not mean that a child who shows","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1178989637\">-=-Even reasoning that the more people who come into contact<br/>\n<br/>\nwith an abused child will be able to detect the abuse, that does not<br/>\n<br/>\nmean that a child who shows no physical bruising or scarring will even<br/>\n<br/>\nbe noticed just because he/she goes to school.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he&#39;ll never be noticed at school if he never goes to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIncest families tend to be very closed and enmeshed.

This was a point that I expressed badly in my first email<br/>\non the topic. The assumption that hs�ers would be less competent than a<br/>\nteacher and basically unobservant, was equally as annoying as the idea that<br/>\nall homeschoolers should be at least suspected of some weirdness if not<br/>\nabusiveness, until proven otherwise. The way the fact that this sad family<br/>\nwere homeschoolers was dramatically revealed, right before the commercial<br/>\nbreak, with all the significant looks between the two cops � In any tv or<br/>\nfilm narrative, the attitudes are not expressed only in the bare storyline,<br/>\nbut also in the structure and supporting artistry. Eg I liked the way all<br/>\nthe food was arranged with symmetrical precision in very high shelves (so<br/>\nthe youngest couldn�t get to it himself). I noticed that the product<br/>\nplacement people had nothing in this home. That means the food vendors<br/>\ndidn�t like the inference that only loony oddballs avoid preservatives in<br/>\ntheir food. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was watching because dh wanted to for some reason, it�s not one of my<br/>\nfavorite shows. My favorite cop type show is Redcap � BBC America. Cool<br/>\nEnglish characters and different types of crimes � the redcaps are military<br/>\npolice, in this case on tour of duty in Germany � just layers of stuff in<br/>\nevery episode.
