REALLY stupid.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nsay anything to him, but shot him a dirty look.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a couple over for whose wedding we&#39;re playing recorder.  We were <br/>\ntalking about music, and when we were done were talking about games and <br/>\nthis&#39;n&#39;that.   The woman has a son Kirby&#39;s age and one much younger.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nknown them for years and years, through the SCA.  She got divorced and her <br/>\nhusband and his new wife wanted to homeschool the boys, and did for a while, <br/>\nbut the real mom couldn&#39;t stand it and so the kids are in school.    <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s dumb thing was this:  He characterized Zoombinis as a &quot;pseudo <br/>\neducational game.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really made me angry, because Keith KNOWS how much real math is in that <br/>\ngame.   I&#39;m sure if we had had a time-out moment, magically, he would have <br/>\nsaid that&#39;s not exactly what he meant to say.  But that&#39;s what he said, and <br/>\nthis mom is already determined not to see learning except in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s the dumbest thing Keith does this month I will be living entirely <br/>\nin the lap of luxury, huh?  LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m going to find the page Jocelyn Vilter found once about how much math <br/>\nis in Zoombinis, and forward him the URL at work, tell him it was kind of a <br/>\nfaux pas to say that in front of Sharon, and that will be about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63619,"nextTopicId":63640}}
