Americans can visit<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com/\">http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com/</a> to send an e-mail petition asking<br/>\n&gt; their Congressional representative to block the regulation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By April 14, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy<br/>\n&gt; Thompson must decide whether to implement the &quot;medical privacy&quot; rules<br/>\n&gt; submitted in the waning days of the Clinton administration. The rules,<br/>\n&gt; published in the Federal Register on December 28, 2000, mandate that<br/>\n&gt; every doctor and health care provider turn patient records over to the<br/>\n&gt; HHS and other federal agencies for &quot;safekeeping&quot; -- regardless of<br/>\n&gt; whether patients consent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;If you like the way the government protected the confidentiality<br/>\n&gt; of your Social Security number, you&#39;re going to love the way it<br/>\n&gt; protects your medical records,&quot; Dasbach said. &quot;The first step toward<br/>\n&gt; protecting your health data is to make sure the government doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; it -- which is why we need to block this regulation immediately.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dasbach noted that the prestigious American Association of<br/>\n&gt; Physicians and Surgeons is also fighting the regulation, which the<br/>\n&gt; group says would &quot;enable if not guarantee wholesale invasions of<br/>\n&gt; privacy.&quot; The letter, which documents section by section the problems<br/>\n&gt; with the regulation, can be viewed online at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aapsonline.org/aaps/confiden/hhscounscomm.htm.\">http://www.aapsonline.org/aaps/confiden/hhscounscomm.htm.</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The regulation would:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Allow the disclosure, without patient consent, of all medical<br/>\n&gt; records for &quot;public health surveillance activities&quot; and dozens of<br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; purposes. Providers could refuse to treat people who refuse to<br/>\n&gt; surrender their records.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Permit police agencies to access medical records without a<br/>\n&gt; search warrant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Give the government the right to access the private notes of a<br/>\n&gt; psychotherapist.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Allow foreign government officials to see Americans&#39; health<br/>\n&gt; records, as long as the U.S. government claims it is doing it for a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;national health purpose.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Establish a &quot;unique patient identifier&quot; -- a number that would<br/>\n&gt; make accessing medical records as easy as reading an individual&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; credit history is now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Allow private insurance companies to access the medical<br/>\n&gt; information and compile it into a database.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Give direct marketers access to medical records, and allow<br/>\n&gt; pharmacies to share prescription records &quot;for the purpose of marketing<br/>\n&gt; health-related products and services&quot; -- all without patient consent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Prevent patients involved in health research projects from<br/>\n&gt; accessing their own medical records.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;If these proposals aren&#39;t stopped, your medical privacy will be<br/>\n&gt; in critical condition,&quot; Dasbach said. &quot;Fortunately, there&#39;s a way to<br/>\n&gt; prevent them from going into effect -- but time is running out. Go to<br/>\n&gt; DefendYourPrivacy.com immediately and join the Libertarian Party&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; campaign. Protect your medical privacy by pulling the plug on these<br/>\n&gt; frightening new regulations.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Americans who visit the site will be able to send an e-mail to<br/>\n&gt; their Congressional representatives urging them to co-sponsor a House<br/>\n&gt; resolution that would block the rules. The measure, HJR 38, sponsored<br/>\n&gt; by U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, declares that the rules &quot;shall have no<br/>\n&gt; force or effect.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Libertarians proved that e-mail is the musket of the 21st<br/>\n&gt; century when we flooded the FDIC with nearly 300,000 comments in<br/>\n&gt; February and March, 1999, forcing the agency to abandon its attack on<br/>\n&gt; Americans&#39; financial privacy,&quot; Dasbach said.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Now we intend to deploy that weapon again to thwart a raid on<br/>\n&gt; medical privacy, and we&#39;re all inviting all Americans to join us.
