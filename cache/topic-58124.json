But the day before public school started<br/>\nin September 2002, my daughter decided she wanted to go. Just like<br/>\nthat, an announcement.  So as I always do, I said  &quot;fine&quot;.  I had no<br/>\nidea that  she would still want to go in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not care about &quot;homework&quot; or &quot;what teachers think&quot;.  I do not feel<br/>\nany pressure from the school  because I do not to take this stuff<br/>\nseriously. I do not see every mark on the paper, good or bad,as a<br/>\nreflection on me or my child. .  My daughter does not got exited over<br/>\n100%&#39;s  or getting things wrong.  She reports that to me in a matter of<br/>\nfactly or not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wants to quit, she knows she can. If she wanted to see how a<br/>\nfarm works, I would arrange for a farm stay, I don&#39;t see this as any<br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe take days off to go skiing and such.  My homeschooling friends think<br/>\nthat is so amazing that the school &quot;allows&quot;  that to happen.  But I<br/>\nwould never think to ask permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, she was 7 yrs and 2 months  old when she started 1st grade<br/>\nin September.  She could not read at all or add or count very high.  I<br/>\nhonestly believe that trying to learn something before it is time will<br/>\nbackfire.  She finds it all easy now and I&#39;m sure it is because we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t push and do not get excited one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nI &#39;m not comfortabe with the word unschooler. I&#39;m thinking  &quot;NO<br/>\nschooler&quot;  although that doesn&#39;t satisfy me either.  I don&#39;t like my<br/>\nidentity to be any kind of schooler.  When I was little, my mother<br/>\ndidn&#39;t say &quot;we&#39;re schoolers&quot; or &quot;we&#39;re public-schoolers&quot; or &quot;we&#39;re<br/>\nprivate-schoolers&quot;.
