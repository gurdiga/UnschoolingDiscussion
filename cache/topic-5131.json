From 8:00 to 9:00<br/>\nevery morning you wish to study Rod Stewart, from 9:00 to 10:00 you wish to<br/>\nstudy monarch butterflies. Here&#39;s the schedule, all written up in<br/>\ntriplicate.

He has<br/>\nalways loved structure, and I hate it, and my three older children are like me.<br/>\nI kept thinking he would grow out of it. The other day he organised his father<br/>\ninto sitting down at the computer and showing him how to use Microsoft Projects<br/>\nso that he could work out a schedule to last him through to the end of the<br/>\nyear, and planned days for math etc. in among all our other activities.... I<br/>\nhave to point out that here in New Zealand, it isn&#39;t just Christmas that&#39;s<br/>\ncoming, but this is the last week of school, for those poor unfortunates who<br/>\nattend such institutions, the last week of all sorts of things for us - music,<br/>\ngym etc, prior to our summer holidays! But ds has scheduled maths etc. all the<br/>\nway through Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s always done such stuff all the time (like waking me up at 6.30am on a<br/>\nSunday for help with math problems) but now he wants it scheduled so he knows<br/>\njust what he has to do (his &#39;has-to&#39;, not mine) and so he can check it off on<br/>\nhis chart as he does it! But, hey, if that&#39;s his way why not? As long as he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t expect me to do it too &lt;g&gt; He&#39;s gradually learning that the rest of us<br/>\nare naturally disoganised and is slowly stopping getting cross. He organises<br/>\nthe cutlery drawer several times a week, and finally agreed that we could put<br/>\nthe clean cutlery on the bench and he would put it away - before that, everyone<br/>\ngot growled at for not putting it away carefully enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am finally accepting that his way is okay too - it&#39;s okay for him to<br/>\nstructure his life, and really, it&#39;s okay for us to help him if he asks.<br/>\nSometimes it really is what they want, and sometimes they need help to learn<br/>\nthe skills of organising and structuring. I have come to realise that structure<br/>\nand unschooling aren&#39;t necessarily at odds - as long as the structure isn&#39;t<br/>\nimposed. Your kid who has been in ps may be the same sort of kid as my little<br/>\nboy (who tried school for 5 weeks at his own request), but the skills don&#39;t<br/>\nalways come naturally, and may need to be learnt, just like other skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Oh my heart is nearly broken.

Now, my two never attended school, so am no expert<br/>\non the &quot;deschooling process&quot;.
