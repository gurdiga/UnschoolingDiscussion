Pre-Columbian art and Chinese <br/>\njade carvings and swords, mostly.   He uses chemistry and microscopic anaylsis <br/>\nto see what tools were used.  He can spot and prove fakes.  He is flown all <br/>\nover the world, and things are shipped to his house all the time, the federal <br/>\nexpress truck painstakingly pulling into his mountain yard and out two or three <br/>\ntimes a week to bring priceless objects which he reports on and ships back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe dropped out of college many years ago, was an artist from the time we were <br/>\nkids, is a musician, eventually got a bachelor&#39;s degree in studio art (not <br/>\nart history) to make his dad happy, and is an unquestionable expert in something <br/>\nhe never studied in college.  Oh.  He also teaches Tai Chi and Kung Fu, and <br/>\nknows more about Chinese medicine than most people in our state, but has no <br/>\n&quot;degree&quot; in that either, and has never practiced, but he does make potioly good <br/>\nhusband and father.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t even start on my friends who have degrees they don&#39;t use or never <br/>\nunderstood in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sometimes a person has a degree AND experience and is worth listening <br/>\nto, but the &quot;worth listening to&quot; is much more likely to come from the experience <br/>\nand actual research than the piece of paper or the classroom time put in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle E.

You guys have already heard about my pond, <br/>\nmultiple times. &lt;LOL&gt; I&#39;ve researched a lot on edible landscaping and <br/>\nnative landscaping. We have a vegetable garden and an herb garden that <br/>\ndoubles as a butterfly garden. We&#39;re working on attracting as many <br/>\nbutterflies and birds as we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also been learning American Sign Language, and I&#39;ve been brushing up <br/>\non my French (we were hoping to travel with dh, who just had a conference <br/>\nin Paris, but $$$ was lacking--isn&#39;t it always!) and playing Madeline with <br/>\nthe kids in French. I have always been into languages. I&#39;m pretty good with <br/>\nFrench, not fluent, but pretty good. I also took several years of Spanish <br/>\nand a summer of Chinese at the community college. Looks like dh might have <br/>\na conference next December in Puerto Rico, so this next year I&#39;ll be going <br/>\nback to the Spanish, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been reading lots on unschooling and, more recently, on food <br/>\nallergies. I&#39;m way into Lord of the Rings--reading the trilogy was my <br/>\nreward to myself after I finished defending my thesis. I had never read it <br/>\nbefore, and I read it while we were in Key West. Dh had a conference (a <br/>\nmajor perk! &lt;g&gt;) at a really posh resort. There was a private beach, but no <br/>\nreal access to the water along the beach because of the reef. But there <br/>\nwere lots of great tidal pools in the rocks for the kids to splash in. It <br/>\nwas truly a slice of heaven!<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26999,"nextTopicId":87977}}
