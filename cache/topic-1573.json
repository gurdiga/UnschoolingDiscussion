I came to the part of Mary Pride&#39;s testimony where she talks about the<br/>\ncost of advertising in her card deck.  My 5, 7 and 9 year olds were all<br/>\nsitting in by me and when I started talking to the computer my 9 year old<br/>\nasked what was up. So I explained what I was reading and about the cost. We<br/>\nhad recieved a coupon pak in the mail yesterday so I had a visual aid handy.<br/>\n&lt;G&gt;  We talked about how Papa John&#39;s pizza wouldn&#39;t want to be in a<br/>\nhomeschooling deck.  I was explaining about being able to target your<br/>\naudience and how Mary Pride got the addresses of so many homeschoolers.  I<br/>\nwas still shocked that it was a $6000 commitment to have a card in that card<br/>\ndeck.  My 5.5 year old, from about 8 feet away with her hand on the<br/>\nrefridgerator said....&quot;it depends on how many homeschooers there are.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I picked up my jaw, I just sort of stared at my own child.  She had<br/>\nbeen listening and taking it all in, which isn&#39;t surprising.  She had also<br/>\nunderstood everything, she saw the big picture within moments.  She was<br/>\nunfrettered in any way about thinking and joining the conversation.  She was<br/>\nalso thinking faster and with more clarity than her 9 year old brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw myself within her.  I saw years of getting things, of seeing the big<br/>\npicture within moments of exploring a topic.  My stomach knotted, for I also<br/>\nsaw what had been done to me.  When I was 5 I was not asked to join the<br/>\nconversation. I was not thought well of for being able to think with clarity<br/>\nand speed. I saw years of retraining where I sat mute, trying to stay out of<br/>\ntrouble and never quite making it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe smiled at me and our conversation went on.  We spent a few more minutes<br/>\ntalking about the price of paper and who designs the artwork on those cards<br/>\nin the card pack.  I, however, found a quiet spot and rejoiced that this<br/>\nchild, my child, would grow up whole.  How very powerful she will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1575,"nextTopicId":1577}}
