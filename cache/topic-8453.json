Is it legal to change your own? Shouldn&#39;t you \nlet a trained professional do it? Won&#39;t your little lamp be brighter if someone \nwho studied for four years (after barely being able to turn on their own lamp) \nchanges your light bulb? What if you screw it in wrong? What if you leave \nsomething out? Don&#39;t you think you should give your little nursery lamp a chance \nto be part of a huge, glowing marquee or chandelier? Bulbs do need to hang in \ngroups, you know. <br><br>Besides, why do you think light bulbs come in multi \npacks? You don&#39;t just go out and get a single light bulb! If one light bulb \nneeds fixing, then you know the others are ready for it, too. Give your \nprofessional a 12 pack and let him/her change them all at once. It&#39;s much more \nefficient and gets you on a schedule with all your light fixtures. And yes, I \nknow you will end up sending some perfectly good light bulbs to the trash that \nway, but on the whole it&#39;s best. Don&#39;t regret the ones that are lost to the \ndump. They were probably pretty dim anyway. <br><br>Look, I sent my lamps to the \nshop for light-bulb changing and my lamps work okay, don&#39;t they? Oh, well, \nexcept for that three-way lamp in the living room which got a stupid 40 watt, \nlow-lumens bulb put in when it should have gotten a three way bulb with up to \n200 watts. I was a little peeved at that at first, but I just put the lamp over \nin the corner where I never sit to read, so it&#39;s okay. <br><br><br>Copyright \n2000 by Clare Bussjaeger but feel free to share if you get a kick <br>out of it \nand will retain my copyright notice including this entire \nsentence.<br><br></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8452,"nextTopicId":8446}}
