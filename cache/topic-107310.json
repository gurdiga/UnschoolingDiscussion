In the interests of<br/>\nease and the gentle reader�s sanity, I will make it a few installments.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn March I wrote the following in response to a question (on UD) about<br/>\nenforcing tooth brushing:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I would rather Jayn had some cavities in her teeth than there be a<br/>\ngaping, festering hole of my creating in our relationship. I have never<br/>\nenforced tooth brushing. She is 5, and her teeth did start to come in<br/>\n&quot;late&quot;, at one year. Of course she sees me and dh brushing, and we have gone<br/>\nthrough a lengthy process of finding toothpastes that she likes the taste<br/>\nof. She is also aware of the one large cavity she has in a molar. Rather<br/>\nthan express the inaccurate information that brushing *will* prevent<br/>\ncavities, I tell her that brushing is more likely to mean fewer cavities, as<br/>\nwell as fresher breath. She also knows that it will be more important to<br/>\nbrush more often when her adult teeth come in. She has recently<br/>\nspontaneously begun brushing her teeth several times a day, rotating through<br/>\nher selection of fun toothbrushes, and sometimes flossing. This is actually<br/>\nunnecessary as her baby teeth are wide apart. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have taken visiting the dentist very gradually. Six months ago she came<br/>\nwith me to my cleaning, and wanted to sit in the chair and &quot;get her teeth<br/>\ncounted&quot;. She asked a lot of questions. Now I am on a quest to find a nice,<br/>\ngentle, lady dentist (Jayn wants a woman) who uses air abrasion when<br/>\npossible, instead of drilling. We will be interviewing and choose the person<br/>\nJayn likes best, and she is looking forward to the visits.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTen days ago, on Tuesday night, Jayn developed an abscess in the tooth with<br/>\nthe large cavity. The condition is called facial cellulitis and is<br/>\ncharacterized by swelling in her cheek near the tooth and some pain. I am<br/>\nsure the abscess was in her gum sooner, but this is when we discovered its<br/>\npresence.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally our immediate alarm caused us (dh and I) to step up my far too<br/>\nrelaxed timetable for finding a congenial dentist and we made an appointment<br/>\non Wednesday for Thursday with a dental office that had been recommended by<br/>\nanother Unschooler as being kind and kid friendly. We explained to Jayn that<br/>\nwe were very concerned, and that she had an infection, and she was very<br/>\nwilling to go to a dentist. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHere�s what has happened since:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this first place Jayn, being willing and ready, immediately sat in the<br/>\nchair and allowed three different people to work in her mouth. The Assistant<br/>\npolished her teeth with the rubber tip and the sucker, did a fluoride<br/>\ntreatment and took a full set of x-rays plus one other one of the bad tooth.<br/>\nThe Hygenist then came in and scraped her teeth with the big old hook tool<br/>\n(Jayn said it made her teeth feel itchy). Then the Dentist came in and<br/>\nexamined her teeth and the x-rays, recommending urgent extraction, and<br/>\nantibiotics.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately (although it turns out that fate had an even better outcome<br/>\nfor us � stand by for the happy ending in a while) the regular dentist, who<br/>\nhad been much recommended, was away. None of the three of us really liked<br/>\nthe stand in dentist much - she was brusque, had a hurried manner, looking<br/>\nmore at the x-rays than in Jayn&#39;s mouth. We didn&#39;t get a reassuring or<br/>\ncaring vibe from her, unlike the other staff in the place. She also found a<br/>\nfair amount of other work needed, but much of that is not visible to the<br/>\neye, between Jayn�s teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless Jayn wanted to return to the same office later anyway because<br/>\nshe really liked the dental assistant, who was delightful, and quite liked<br/>\nthe hygienist. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn was an incredibly brave little trooper, even with the x-rays and<br/>\ngetting her teeth polished and scraped by the hygienist. She answered all<br/>\ntheir questions about brushing and flossing and I could tell that she was<br/>\nreally comfortable with the DA because she started sharing her &quot;sky is<br/>\nfalling&quot; fantasy with her. James was actually more nervous than Jayn once it<br/>\ncame to the crunch.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only difficulty was that they do not do any of this kind of extraction<br/>\nor anesthesia work at this office, only fillings with nitrous oxide, so they<br/>\nreferred us to an Oral Surgeon. This was disappointing � more on that later.<br/>\nThey also gave us a prescription for an antibiotic. This began to work and<br/>\nthe swelling started to recede at once. We made an appointment for the<br/>\nfollowing Monday with their recommended guy at 7am. (First mistake!)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*****************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWell the Monday was a disaster, and the saga continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn being on nights was already stressed, tired and extremely hungry (in<br/>\npreparation for the sedation) by the time we got to the oral surgeon at 7am.<br/>\nI had hoped that she would simply be willing to drink the versed and snooze.<br/>\nNo. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike the first dental establishment, this place was very clinical in<br/>\natmosphere, and the old guy, who you would have thought would be avuncular,<br/>\nwas not careful, slow or patient in his approach. Some of his first words<br/>\nwere &quot;Stop crying&quot; and he tried to pull Jayn&#39;s hands from in front of her<br/>\nmouth. This was before any sedation. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it was immediately evident that James and I were not going to support<br/>\nholding her down at all, he went off to get the Versed. Now Jayn will<br/>\nusually undertake some ministration or take her medicine if given enough<br/>\ntime, and patient waiting, so we were ready to wait, except that instead of<br/>\nbecoming calmer and more willing, Jayn got increasingly agitated every time<br/>\nshe tried to taste the stuff. I took some on my finger, and it is truly<br/>\nawful and foul smelling. She just couldn&#39;t stomach it, although bless her<br/>\nshe really did try.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe doctor kept looking in to see how it was going. James tried a syringe to<br/>\noffer the stuff. The nurse that James described as a &quot;battleaxe&quot; said to<br/>\nhim, &quot;Let us go in there and we&#39;ll make her take it&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not how we live, as you all know. BTW I did come to realize what my<br/>\nbiggest error was at this point, but in the interests of chronology I�ll<br/>\ntell you later and you can have fun guessing what that might be.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we finally left there, feeling rather disappointed, went to get some<br/>\nfood, and then went home to sleep at about 9.30am.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe rose at 1.00pm in order to visit the back up oral surgeon that James had<br/>\nalso made an appointment with, through a referral from one of our friend&#39;s<br/>\ndentists. This second person is one who will bring in an anesthesiologist,<br/>\nsomething that I saw being recommended a lot on the Very Young Kids Teeth<br/>\nlist for IV sedation. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis man was also not impressed with our evident refusal to back up the<br/>\nforce tactics that seem to be the first option, rather than last resort,<br/>\nwith these people.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n He gave me the distinct impression that he was really just too busy to take<br/>\nthe time needed for Jayn to get comfortable and brushed the surgery off as<br/>\ntaking 15 minutes. Apparently he would schedule that small amount of time<br/>\n(although the office was empty when we arrived.) One of the sticking points<br/>\nis this oral dose of Versed - and everyone seems entirely unwilling to just<br/>\ngive Jayn a quick shot and let her gently fall asleep in our arms. It is as<br/>\nif they *want* to create a traumatic experience of being overpowered in the<br/>\nchild. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe dentist also resorted to a strategy that seems to be typical amongst<br/>\nWestern medical practitioners of scare tactics - expressing the worst case<br/>\nscenario in tones of doom, and exaggerated urgency. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have already researched the infection that Jayn has, as confirmed by<br/>\nthe dentist, and I know that left untreated  it is very likely to become a<br/>\nlife threatening infection requiring hospitalization - after it migrates<br/>\ninto the jaw or eye socket. However we are not leaving it untreated (she<br/>\n*is* taking antibiotics - a necessary step also in reducing her pain and to<br/>\nallow the anesthesia to work) and a couple of days or a week will not<br/>\nsuddenly plunge her into a life threatening situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe rather rudely brushed us off with advice to go to UCLA School of<br/>\nPediatric Dentistry, but couldn&#39;t give us any names of personnel - even of<br/>\nhis professor apparently. Then he said &quot;I&#39;ll be right back&quot;, left the room<br/>\nand sent in the secretary with Jayn&#39;s x-ray and a post in note with the<br/>\nwords &quot;UCLA School of Pediatric Dentistry&quot; written on it (as if we were too<br/>\nstupid to remember those words) and no phone number. When James asked about<br/>\nthe number in astonishment, she suggested we try the Yellow Pages!!! The<br/>\ndentist didn&#39;t even say good bye and good luck or anything at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we came home. James got on the phone. I got on the internet and the<br/>\nupshot of it is that we have an appointment with the lady that another local<br/>\nunschooler recommends (did I mention that part of the problem is that Jayn<br/>\nstill wants all her dental folk to be women?) who *sounded* wonderful. She<br/>\noriginally was going to squeeze us in on Thursday, but called and changed it<br/>\nto tomorrow, Wednesday when she will have a lot more time.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are told she plays with the kids until they are comfortable, and prefers<br/>\nlocal anesthetic. The only fly in the ointment is the early hour of the<br/>\nappointment - 10.30am. Jayn is seeing this as a meeting appointment, with<br/>\nthe possibility of doing the extraction if she feels comfortable. If she is<br/>\nnot willing, we may have to wait two weeks while the dentist goes on<br/>\nvacation. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to make it clear that James speaks at length to any prospective<br/>\npractitioner � he is much better at that than I am. He explains our<br/>\nparenting philosophy and asks questions about how child friendly they are.<br/>\nWe must be using the same words but have different meanings for them because<br/>\neven the concept of Patience seems to be differently defined by health<br/>\nprofessionals.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nStand by for Part Two�..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
