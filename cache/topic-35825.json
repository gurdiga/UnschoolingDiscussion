High school units are simply for graduation, and I suppose <br/>\nother things. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd by the way, yes, I was the resident right wing extremist Christian white <br/>\nmale at that other list. But I&#39;ve mellowed with age; plus, I have another <br/>\nlist that I can bitch and moan at (poor them!). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you remember, I play drums for a living. For the past couple years or so <br/>\nI&#39;ve traveled quite a bit and thus have often left my kids (12 and 8) pretty <br/>\nmuch on their own (with the help of an extremely expensive sitter service -- <br/>\nand my wife). Unschooling tends to work its way into our lives regardless of <br/>\nwhat we do, and it&#39;s a good thing I&#39;ve been reading about it for years. <br/>\nActually, I stumbled upon it long before I knew I&#39;d ever be married or have <br/>\nkids. When I&#39;m gone, the kids get excited because they are on their own when <br/>\nit comes to school (though they DO miss me ... I hope).<br/>\n<br/>\nA long and boring story as an example: I just finished a two week gig in <br/>\nRancho Mirage, CA, and I brought the kids with me for much of it, because <br/>\nit&#39;s beautiful and I didn&#39;t want to spend our life savings on hiring a <br/>\nsitter, and I truly wanted to hang with them somewhere other than home. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring my time out I usually bring along stacks of books and magazines -- <br/>\nincluding HEM. During this most recent trip I really got into reading it more <br/>\nthan anything else I brought along. But I also brought a book called <br/>\n&quot;Deschooling Our Lives,&quot; which you&#39;re probably familiar with, and found <br/>\nmyself reading it during the gig! These two reads were perfect for this trip, <br/>\nfor my kids were doing no school while they were with me, but were rather <br/>\nplaying in the pool, studying lines for a play, and learning to hang out <br/>\ntogether in a strange -- yet lovely -- hotel room, and having the time of <br/>\ntheir lives pretty much on their own (I was basically down the hall in the <br/>\nballroom). Unschooling was what they needed, and was what I needed to be <br/>\nreading about to calm my nerves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, I am a desperate fan of Grace Llewellyn, et al. but I&#39;m also a <br/>\ndevoted student of Albert Jay Nock, Jacques Barzun, and anyone ever caught up <br/>\nin what may be called &quot;the humane life.&quot; But for them and me this usually <br/>\nmeans Western Civilization (don&#39;t kill me just yet), or at least the periodic <br/>\nbursts of humanity that occasionally brake through this &quot;civilization&quot; (and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean to deny the bursts of light in other civilizations -- possibly <br/>\neven greater bursts. But the West is my civilization, even as its history <br/>\nbewilders, offends, disappoints, and shocks). <br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, Nock was unschooled until he hit college, and then it was Greek, <br/>\nGreek, and more Greek. He claimed to be a philosophical anarchist, and though <br/>\nhe&#39;d never want responsibility for such a thing, he is the perfect paradigm <br/>\nfor unschoolers who tend toward the Western tradition. I can&#39;t call myself <br/>\nthat just yet, but I&#39;m trying. Really. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sorry for rambling. I&#39;m hanging at this list because beside my <br/>\nWestern paternalistic Christian power trip, I really dig unschooling and am <br/>\ntruly working at letting it have its way. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, my kids may want to go to college someday, and because I don&#39;t like to <br/>\nplay the state legal game if I can help it, I&#39;m trying to find options for <br/>\nthem for high school; you know, getting them into college -- if they wish -- <br/>\nwithout destroying them before they have that chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Sale<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Toward College","postDate":"1019687116","msgId":35940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyYTYwMWMxZWJlMCQwMjQ0MGI2MCQ1YzVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2NC5jYjc4YjYyLjI5Zjg2MTRiQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35932,"nextInTopic":35949,"prevInTime":35939,"nextInTime":35941,"topicId":35825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"No units get transferred from a high school to a college/university.
