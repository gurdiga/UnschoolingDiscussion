And dubbing them is expensive. (Most<br/>\npeople who appreciate anime want subtitles, but the manufacturers can sell<br/>\nmore if they&#39;re dubbed.) In Japan, anime is marketed to all sorts of<br/>\naudiences, as wide a range as movies in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn TV, the big audience is kids: Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Digimon, Yu-gi-oh,<br/>\nGundam, Hello Kitty, Hamtaro. Cartoon Network has a block of it 4-6 (or so)<br/>\nevery weekday afternoon and some more adult stuff Saturday around midnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat lack of variety seems to be changing with DVD&#39;s which, though they<br/>\noften are priced higher, maybe are cheaper to get into production, ship<br/>\n(they&#39;re lighter), display (they&#39;re smaller) so companies can make a profit<br/>\noff a title that won&#39;t sell a huge number of disks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some of the dark, violent, sexual ones are very good -- for adults of<br/>\ncourse! -- even for people who don&#39;t normally watch dark, violent, sexual<br/>\nstuff like me ;-) Akira comes to mind.

The division between good and bad can be less distinct than in<br/>\nwestern cartoons (and western movies for that matter.) Anime stories tend to<br/>\nbe on going with the characters changing and developing over the course of<br/>\nthe series so it gives more of a feeling of tension that anything could<br/>\nhappen. And that you&#39;ll miss something if you don&#39;t keep watching. ;-) (In<br/>\nfact sometimes they&#39;ll start all over again with a different story line like<br/>\nthey did in Tenchi.) Basically they treat the viewer as intelligent. For<br/>\nsome reason kids like that! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnime developed out of -- and are still often translations of -- Japanese<br/>\ncomics (manga) which is a *huge* industry in Japan. And *not* just for kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither is anime just for kids. Some (perhaps a lot since the market for it<br/>\nin the US tends to be teen and 20&#39;s males) is very definitely not for kids.<br/>\nIn Japan there isn&#39;t the western prejudice against sci-fi and animation and<br/>\nthey can use both to tell a story without the fear that they&#39;re limiting<br/>\ntheir audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why the big eyes on the<br/>\n&gt; character ;)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They are windows to the soul :-) The most innocent characters have the<br/>\nbiggest eyes with the most light spots. Westerners tend to think they are<br/>\nwestern eyes, but westerners don&#39;t have baseball sized eyes any more than<br/>\nthe Japanese do. ;-) The eyes just indicate something about the character.<br/>\nSort of like black hair in western movies indicating a bad person and blond<br/>\nhair a good person. The eyes are just more so. It&#39;s probably a holdover from<br/>\nthe comic books where they can often tell a lot of the story without words.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hair, too, is a holdover from manga with imaginative hairstyles and<br/>\nunnatural colors. It helps people identify characters quickly. The covers<br/>\nare colored but the inside pages of most books are black and white so having<br/>\ndistinctive hair was a big help in keeping the characters straight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How does it compare to &quot;American&quot;<br/>\n&gt; cartoons?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she hasn&#39;t seen My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, go out and<br/>\nrent them right now. They&#39;re a full course meal and make Disney look like<br/>\nFizzies.  (Of course Miyazaki is the best of the best and his lastest<br/>\npicture (Spirited Away I think is the English title) is the highest grossing<br/>\nfilm of all time in Japan.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

And that you&#39;ll miss something if you don&#39;t keep watching. ;-) (In<br/>\nfact sometimes they&#39;ll start all over again with a different story line like<br/>\nthey did in Tenchi.) Basically they treat the viewer as intelligent. For<br/>\nsome reason kids like that! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnime developed out of -- and are still often translations of -- Japanese<br/>\ncomics (manga) which is a *huge* industry in Japan. And *not* just for kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither is anime just for kids. Some (perhaps a lot since the market for it<br/>\nin the US tends to be teen and 20&#39;s males) is very definitely not for kids.<br/>\nIn Japan there isn&#39;t the western prejudice against sci-fi and animation and<br/>\nthey can use both to tell a story without the fear that they&#39;re limiting<br/>\ntheir audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why the big eyes on the<br/>\n&gt; character ;)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They are windows to the soul :-) The most innocent characters have the<br/>\nbiggest eyes with the most light spots. Westerners tend to think they are<br/>\nwestern eyes, but westerners don&#39;t have baseball sized eyes any more than<br/>\nthe Japanese do. ;-) The eyes just indicate something about the character.<br/>\nSort of like black hair in western movies indicating a bad person and blond<br/>\nhair a good person. The eyes are just more so. It&#39;s probably a holdover from<br/>\nthe comic books where they can often tell a lot of the story without words.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hair, too, is a holdover from manga with imaginative hairstyles and<br/>\nunnatural colors. It helps people identify characters quickly. The covers<br/>\nare colored but the inside pages of most books are black and white so having<br/>\ndistinctive hair was a big help in keeping the characters straight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How does it compare to &quot;American&quot;<br/>\n&gt; cartoons?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she hasn&#39;t seen My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, go out and<br/>\nrent them right now. They&#39;re a full course meal and make Disney look like<br/>\nFizzies.  (Of course Miyazaki is the best of the best and his lastest<br/>\npicture (Spirited Away I think is the English title) is the highest grossing<br/>\nfilm of all time in Japan.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126158464,"authorName":"Sally Ann Vinke","from":"Sally Ann Vinke &lt;sally@...&gt;","profile":"bellalunadesigns","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] anime","postDate":"1033969699","msgId":45541,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyMEUwQUI1LUQ5QjgtMTFENi04Mzk5LTAwMDM5Mzc4QjRFMkB2aW5rZWZhbWlseS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxNDgzUUd5amJKd1NRdERTQ1kwMDAwOWI3ZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45540,"nextInTopic":45543,"prevInTime":45540,"nextInTime":45542,"topicId":45538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Try this link, looks like a good place to pick up the basics. :-) http://web.singnet.com.sg/~liviafyk/ sally ... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sally Ann Vinke BellaLuna","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-924710122\">Try this link, looks like a good place to pick up the basics. :-)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.singnet.com.sg/~liviafyk/\">http://web.singnet.com.sg/~liviafyk/</a><br/>\nsally<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sunday, October 6, 2002, at 11:08  PM, Mary Bianco wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Could someone please tell me what anime is and what goes on with it <br/>\n&gt; all?
