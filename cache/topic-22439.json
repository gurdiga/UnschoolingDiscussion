Many times on this list I have seen folks<br/>\nabsolutely livid over CPS coming into homeschooling homes and trying to<br/>\nremove children.  I have seen folks on this list make almost identical<br/>\nstatements to those made by this mom.

For all we know,  dogs chased and bit someone who was either<br/>\n&gt; accidentally trespassing while on a nature walk or   was intent on<br/>\nchecking out<br/>\n&gt; this prime property.
