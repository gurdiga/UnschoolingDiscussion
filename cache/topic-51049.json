My son will be coming to work with me for part of the morning, so he&#39;ll have to be up and dressed and ready to come with me and he&#39;ll be with me for about 2-3 hours each morning until his dad picks him up. So my plan is to have him bring some items of his own choosing to work with him and work on them as he wishes while he&#39;s with me. My mom also works with me - we&#39;re partners in a business - so that will also show her that he will be doing something and not &quot;just sitting around watching TV&quot; (her words). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe school does give the parent the curriculum when they withdraw. I just need to have dh agree to let him stay home after the holidays. I think he&#39;s willing to do this but he wants more time to get used to it and that&#39;s why he&#39;s saying to wait. <br/>\n<br/>\nChristina in GA<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Earthmomma67@...\">Earthmomma67@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 09, 2002 6:58 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Private school tuition<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 12/9/02 9:44:37 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clr71@...\">clr71@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I believe they would give us a pro-rated refund amount for what we owe but I <br/>\n  &gt; do know that we have to pay for the curriculum.
