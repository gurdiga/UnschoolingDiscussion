Took our time.  Mostly socks and <br/>\nunderwear, one toy she knew she wanted before she got there, a pair of new <br/>\nkid-Fiskars, a box of cereal on sale.   Leisurely, warm, safe, not too far from home.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr check out check out a different one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo fight the stir-crazies we tried out something new this week - the kids had never been skiing.  We spent a couple days at my Mom&#39;s and went to the ski hill where she is a member (at least for the first day - only one of the three kids enjoyed it so we changed our plans for day 2).  And just change of location for a couple days helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun, but that evening my daughter and I checked out &quot;her&quot; Wal-Mart and had a great time!  Quite different stock from ours, though she&#39;s only an hour away.  My daughter found a dressing gown 60% off and a lace nightgown, we found an alarm clock and MIB on tape really cheap for my youngest son (he&#39;s 6 and loves MIB2 and has been playing constantly with his new clock), and I found Henry V on DVD (have never seen it before - our library doesn&#39;t have it - but after rave reviews here I&#39;m eager to watch it).  And we picked up some Krispy Kreme donuts there to take back for the eldest as a surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was snowing when we finally left, but we were in no rush so we drove back to my Mom&#39;s slowly and enjoyed watching blizzard. We were so excited the rest of the night about our great finds. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89864,"nextTopicId":89855}}
