I think that aggression can create positive or negitive energy around us and what we are is what we attract. I also work on negitive thoughts, when I catch myself thinking negitive, I try to remember a worse situation that I could be in. {If I&#39;m frustrated with the dishes, I think of my grandmother who didn&#39;t have indoor heated running water for most of her life..}<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m human and sometimes get bummed out, but it has helped me a great deal in how i react and that seems to affect{?} those around me...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think since I explained it to my husband {without pressure just a suggestion} he does it sometimes too, of course quietly to himself without my knowledge - LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
