Alfie Kohn is the author.  I also saw him speak to an <br/>\naudience of teachers and school administrators.  I like what he has <br/>\nto say.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Punished by Rewards&#39; is a book I&#39;ve used with my prospective-teacher students. I&#39;ve also used his thinner, more-condensed book, &#39;Beyond Discipline.&#39; (I prefer PBR because in it he provides all of the rationale for his point of view). With both books, I met lots of resistance to the ideas and ways of being and teaching that he recommends. Although my students are intrigued and think that &quot;in an ideal world&quot; his ideas might work, &quot;we don&#39;t live in an ideal world,&quot; thus they seek the comfort of the behaviorist mindset, that kids *need* to be rewarded in order to want to do any of the often incredibly useless and boring stuff that they have to do in school. It&#39;s almost like they forget what it&#39;s like to be a student in school! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I hear from one or two of them that they are transformed. I see their words on paper and I see their interaction change in class and I know that a few will enter schools questioning and challenging the status quo. That is exciting!<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery day Kohn&#39;s words (and yours here -- thanks!) challenge me to trust my children. He doesn&#39;t advocate abdicating parental responsibility, and he shares that his own transition to fatherhood severely tested him and his views. Sometimes I don&#39;t want to be the grownup; I just want to have my way with no arguments or explanations. Maybe it&#39;s because my kids are pretty young (8, 5, 3) that I get non-stop questions, but one thing PBR and BD have helped me to see is that the questions are usually steps toward begin able to find harmony, it just takes a little longer (and lasts longer) than having clear-cut rules and consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35978,"nextTopicId":35989}}
