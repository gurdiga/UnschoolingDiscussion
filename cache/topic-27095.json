The Electronic<br/>\nPrivacy<br/>\n&gt; Information Center (EPIC) in Washington was ready to go full rounds with<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; government in court over Carnivore, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey,<br/>\n&gt; R-Texas, asked Attorney General John Ashcroft to take another look at its<br/>\n&gt; constitutionality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, though, the country is asking for more, not less, law enforcement on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; Internet, and even those who once complained are coming around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I have two minds on this,&quot; says Fred Peterson, vice president of<br/>\ngovernment<br/>\n&gt; affairs for the Xybernaut Corporation, which manufactures computer<br/>\ntechnology<br/>\n&gt; for military and law enforcement. The past six weeks have left little<br/>\ndoubt in<br/>\n&gt; most peoples&#39; mind, he said, that new measures must be taken.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I think that the threat has increased and while (FBI) demands were<br/>\nunreasonable<br/>\n&gt; at a time when the threat was less immediate and less fatal - it&#39;s just<br/>\nnot the<br/>\n&gt; same story anymore,&quot; he said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Others are still skeptical, though not as much.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think (FBI) motives are bad, but I do think they&#39;re using<br/>\npeople&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; current state of mind - they&#39;re using it to their advantage,&quot; said Mikal<br/>\nCondon,<br/>\n&gt; staff attorney for EPIC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The new FBI plans would give the agency a technical backdoor to the<br/>\nnetworks of<br/>\n&gt; Internet service providers&#39; like AOL and Earthlink and Web hosting<br/>\ncompanies,<br/>\n&gt; Baker said. It would concentrate Internet traffic in several central<br/>\nlocations<br/>\n&gt; where e-mail and other web activity could be wiretapped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Baker said he expects the agency will approach the Internet companies on<br/>\nan<br/>\n&gt; individual basis to ask for their help in the endeavor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But Jim Harper, staff counsel for privacy advocate Privacilla.org said the<br/>\nFBI<br/>\n&gt; may have a hard time convincing some companies to redesign the Internet on<br/>\nits<br/>\n&gt; behalf. &quot;It&#39;s not really surprising, but I would be shocked to see if it<br/>\ngets<br/>\n&gt; done,&quot; he said. &quot;Restructuring the Internet? I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Others say the Internet companies will not put up much of a fight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sue Ashdown, executive director of the Washington-based American ISP<br/>\n&gt; Association, an Internet company trade group, said most Internet companies<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t healthy enough financially to take on the government in court to<br/>\nprotect<br/>\n&gt; their subscribers&#39; privacy rights. And no one, she says, wants to appear<br/>\n&gt; hostile to law enforcement right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I know there are a lot of members in the association with feelings on<br/>\nboth<br/>\n&gt; sides,&quot; said Ashdown.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;In the current patriotic climate, enterprises of all types will likely<br/>\nplay<br/>\n&gt; along with the FBI in order to avoid a public relations disaster,&quot; said<br/>\nGene<br/>\n&gt; Riccoboni, an Internet attorney with the Stamford, Connecticut-based<br/>\n&gt; Grimes & Battersby. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27064,"nextTopicId":27074}}
