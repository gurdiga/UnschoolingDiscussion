I have been a lurker who<br/>\nhas been on this list for only a couple months I guess...So that<br/>\nsaid...Hello to you all.  I have a question can someone point me in<br/>\nthe right direction to finding out different ways to record what my<br/>\nchildren are doing so that when they have there evaluations it will<br/>\nall make sense to the evaluator who is a certified teacher.  When we<br/>\nmoved from Albuquerque to Florida all I did was journal which was<br/>\nfine with the evaluator, but now since we have been unschooling<br/>\nlonger, I no longer &quot;watch&quot; what my children do in order to<br/>\ncompartmentalize their activities into &quot;school subject boxes&quot; as I<br/>\nused to.  Suddenly I am realizing that I still need to meet this<br/>\nrequirement for the state.  All that to say that I need suggestions<br/>\non how to explain what my children do without going back to looking<br/>\nat everything through &quot;school&quot; eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for Sandra, I am almost positive that I spoke to you once early<br/>\non when me moved to Albuquerque back in 2001 and was looking for<br/>\nhomeschool support groups that was when I first learned of<br/>\nunschooling.  Unschooling has sort of evolved for us and what once<br/>\nseemed proposterous is now the norm in our home.  I am forever<br/>\ngrateful for finding this message board and the support it has<br/>\noffered me through all of your experiences and insight.  TIA for any<br/>\nsuggestions about the record keeping.  Oh and anyway to legally get<br/>\naround it would be even more phenomenal.<br/>\n<br/>\nDana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS<br/>\nSecondary school education<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary</a><br/>\n+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=G<br/>\nraduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+e<br/>\nducation&c=6&s=18%20&gt;<br/>\nGraduate school education<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Secondary+\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Secondary+</a><br/>\nschool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gr<br/>\naduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+ed<br/>\nucation&c=6&s=185%20&gt;<br/>\nHome school education<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho</a><br/>\nol+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gradua<br/>\nte+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+educat<br/>\nion&c=6&s=185&.si%20&gt;<br/>\nGraduate school education online<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1=Sec\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1=Sec</a><br/>\nondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+educatio<br/>\nn&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+sc<br/>\nhool+education&c=%20&gt;<br/>\nHigh school education<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+scho</a><br/>\nol+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gradua<br/>\nte+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+educat<br/>\nion&c=6&s=185&.si%20&gt;<br/>\nChicago school education<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Gra<br/>\nduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+edu<br/>\ncation&c=6&s=185&%20&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
