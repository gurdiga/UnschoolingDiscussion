When she and her husband were together, he was supportive of unschooling, but now he is using it as a weapon against her.  The court has had three psychiatrists come in (three!!) and examine her fitness as a parent, and all have agreed that the father (even though he is an alcoholic) would offer a more structured, positive environment for the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are, btw, 11 yo twins, and one isn&#39;t reading yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am asking for here (aside from advice if anyone has it) are the names of some unschooling experts who we could contact to perhaps write letters outlining the legitimacy of this form of education, so as to offer the judge some point of reference.  Apparently, they are equating unschooling with neglect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought of you, Sandra, but I can&#39;t bring up the other names like Cafi and David -- no last names or e-mail addresses.  Can someone provide me with those?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe community here is planning on starting a letter-writing campaign in support of this mom from a personal perspective, but some expert information about the benefits of unschooling might be very helpful as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA,<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59630,"nextTopicId":108641}}
