Is all sci-fi<br/>\nbad or just the adolescent stuff she&#39;s reading?  I think there is some<br/>\nreally great sci-fi literature!  Has she read Isaac Asimov&#39;s Foundation<br/>\ntrilogy or his robot books?  They are really good IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also found anime to have some powerful messages - have you watched<br/>\nany of the films with her or read any of the mongas (sp?)?  There is some<br/>\nanime that a lot of 11 year olds wouldn&#39;t be ready for too - too dark for<br/>\nsensitive children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be glad to try to help you find some redeeming qualities in these<br/>\ninterests!  She does need to learn to share things like the computer<br/>\ntoo though so I support you in getting her off so you can have your<br/>\nturn.

I just don&#39;t like how my 11 yo clamps<br/>\nonto some trend and doesn&#39;t come up for air until something even worse comes<br/>\nalong. Why can&#39;t she be obsessed with French Impressionism for awhile<br/>\ninstead of (I can hardly bring myself to say this...)&quot;Sailor Moon&quot;? And I<br/>\nthought Pokemon was mindless?....this is worse. I&#39;ve told her why I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike it (because in Japan where it was created it&#39;s mainly about who has the<br/>\nbiggest tits...try to imagine the character&#39;s banter). But she doesn&#39;t see<br/>\nthat, she sees the &quot;cool&quot; hair and outfits. What she does is print countless<br/>\npages of Sailor Moon pictures and she and her younger sister color them and<br/>\nwrite &quot;bios&quot; that were also downloaded. My house is swamped with these<br/>\npapers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe _one_ redeeming quality of S.M. (and I looked hard) is Cristina now has<br/>\nquite a knowledge of astronomy, since all the characters have the names of<br/>\nthe planets. A neighbor boy came over to borrow the computer; he had a<br/>\nreport on Jupiter due for school. Cristina proceeded to tell him all about<br/>\nJupiter. He was impressed, but used the computer anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe books she&#39;s into are like Animporphs only worse....&quot;Other World&quot;. If she<br/>\nread only that, I&#39;d protest. We read aloud (Harry Potter right now) and she<br/>\nis like her dad and me...she&#39;ll pick up something and read for a few<br/>\nminutes, whatever&#39;s laying around (newspaper, magazine, book) so she gets<br/>\nvariety. But the majority of what she is reading is this Other World series.<br/>\nRather dark. I know she&#39;ll overload on it eventually and move on to<br/>\nsomething else, but I was thinking that with Animorphs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad is really into science fantasy. He bought C her first of that kind<br/>\nrecently: Tad Williams&#39; &quot;Mirror World&quot;. She&#39;s only read the first chapter so<br/>\nfar. Too busy with SM and OW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it bugs me that she gets so obsessive about these things and expects<br/>\neveryone else to be thrilled, too. In fact, she is severely disappointed if<br/>\nnot bent out of shape if others _don&#39;t_ share her current passion. But that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bother me nearly as much as her Center of the Universe delusion.<br/>\nThat manifests itself with hogging the bathroom, the computer, leaving her<br/>\njunk all over the house, using other people&#39;s stuff without asking, etc,<br/>\netc. She just doesn&#39;t get it or she just doesn&#39;t care or maybe both. I worry<br/>\nshe will never grow out of it and end up alone with nothing but books and a<br/>\ncomputer for company.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to clarify...she is very smart and creative and active.
