As I learned during a noted train-wreck of a discussion on another list,  there seem to be some number people in the world who do not believe that they have choices -- instead feeling that there are some number of things that they *have* to do.  (And that their children will *have* to do).  (The same people seem to me to tend not to think of &quot;joy&quot; as a sufficient goal, either -- maybe the two attitudes are related?).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe until people realize that they CAN choose, they are already constrained and stopped - without even the benefit of having made the conscious choice to stop. I am coming to think that realizing that *one has a choice* a necessary prerequisite to ever &quot;getting it&quot; about radical unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  No parent has to do anything.

But only the<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers were focusing on fun and having positive relationships with<br/>\n&gt; their kids. Much of the other forums were devoted to how to make kids <br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; their work, what products were best, what to do with younger kids while<br/>\n&gt; older ones did their work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;This got me thinking, Joyce. Because I found unschooling the same way, <br/>\njust looking for homeschooling information and discovered that the <br/>\nmessage boards where the unschoolers were talking were the ones that <br/>\ngot my heart racing because they were so alive and sparkly with ideas <br/>\nand energy and fun and love of their children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my favorite memories from those times were when someone who was <br/>\ncareful to identify with the structured side of town, as it were, would come over <br/>\nto the unschooling board with a really off-the-wall and interesting question of <br/>\nobscure nature.   And each time, the person said something like, &quot;I figured <br/>\nif anyone knew this it would be one of you.&quot;   And the questions would be about <br/>\nhistory, usually, or a request for how something might be connected to <br/>\nsomething else, or how a child might be hooked up with an interesting mentor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was as blatant an acknowledgement as could have been, for me, that the <br/>\nother homeschoolers respected us as more knowledgeable and creative and aware of <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why wouldn&#39;t they then also want to unschool?<br/>\nSome did.  <br/>\nSome people who started on that end crossed the tracks and loosened up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some people don&#39;t consider themselves to be knowledgeable or creative, <br/>\nand (perhaps) have decided that they don&#39;t need to start now.  They&#39;re out of <br/>\nschool and don&#39;t have to learn anything else.  Their kids can have school fed <br/>\ninto and through them and then *they* won&#39;t need to learn anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shortest distance between two points is a straight line, as is <br/>\nmathematically stated.    Sometimes a straight line isn&#39;t possible (thinking of airline <br/>\nflight paths, for one thing &lt;g&gt;), and my children didn&#39;t HAVE two points to <br/>\npass one to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nThe complications come from the combination of philosophical elements (as <br/>\nJulie mentioned) and of the defensiveness of parents who say &quot;I don&#39;t have to do <br/>\nall that&quot; (whatever &quot;that&quot; is for them). <br/>\n<br/>\nTrue. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo parent has to do anything.  They choose to do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo being in that world of choices, where do they decide to stop and why?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere comes the philosophy back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough all the innumerable factors, how DO people decide?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy deciding what principles they are following.  Each principle one clings to <br/>\neliminates about half the choices in the world easily, and in a good way.   <br/>\nEach additional principle eliminates some more options, until the world becomes <br/>\nmanageable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my guiding principles is that I want my children&#39;s worlds to be <br/>\nsparkly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere goes the dull and the darkness.  Easily not chosen, not an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100832,"nextTopicId":100835}}
