Here in St Louis city all of<br/>\n&gt;the school grounds are these big slabs of asphalt, most have no play<br/>\n&gt;equipment, grass to sit on or anything.  High schoolers are not even<br/>\n&gt;allowed outside during the day.  When is there time to socialize?  If you<br/>\n&gt;help the kid in the neighboring desk, you are cheating.

But once they grow up it is adults they have to deal with, not<br/>\n&gt;really kids.  To me, a child&#39;s ability to socialize with adults is just as<br/>\n&gt;important being able to run screaming with other kids.  Schools do not give<br/>\n&gt;a good balance of that.  You have ONE teacher (sometimes one per subject,<br/>\n&gt;but that is still ONE authority on a topic) that you deal with.  Going to<br/>\n&gt;ask for help from other teachers is looked down upon.

They will<br/>\n&gt;not have to deal with self esteem crushing failure, but rather will learn<br/>\n&gt;how to deal with their mistakes and how to fix their own problems.  They<br/>\n&gt;will know kindness instead of hatred and bigotry.  They will care about<br/>\n&gt;other humans and not just be suspicious of others.
