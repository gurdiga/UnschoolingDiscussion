I would as well I think. <br/>\nI do believe I might talk to the instructor and tell her where you are coming <br/>\nfrom and that you are there for the young one to have some fun while enjoying <br/>\nmusic and interacting with other kids. . .period. I&#39;m sure others may have <br/>\nsome good ideas on this one too. I would just encourage you to stand up for <br/>\nyour beliefs if you feel this is important and I sense it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"brendaclaspell@aol.com","from":"brendaclaspell@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bE4l7xvoN1YWP1meOuyh7NHDHaS754oiTeWDqFq4MSvpPpI-wPzfPkUFwEH3L-fjqVZu1q-j71X2Q7z8tg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Art Class","postDate":"1001008365","msgId":26102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1My4xNDczZDZlLjI4ZGI4NmVkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26103,"prevInTime":26101,"nextInTime":26103,"topicId":26102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gotta question.

Ds, 3yo just started a ten week art class. 30 minutes each of <br/>\ndance, art, and music. The dance part is great, the instructor just does her <br/>\nthing, is very enthusiastic, if the kids follow along great, and if not she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mind. The kids are all 3-5. But the art and esp. music bug me, and I <br/>\nthink my son. The music is more focused on listening to words, repeating, <br/>\nstepping on the beat, etc. And the instructor will stop to try to get each <br/>\nchild to do it right. Seems almost equally focused on following instructions, <br/>\nif not more so, than experiencing music. Ds loved it all last week, but this <br/>\nweek was a bit more determined not to do as instructed (inside I cheer :-)). <br/>\nAt home, this is great. We have all the stuff and he does or doesn&#39;t do as he <br/>\nwants to. But at the class....well, I dunno what to do. And it&#39;s not like <br/>\nhe&#39;s just sitting there not doing it, he&#39;s kinda doing his own thing, <br/>\ndeliberately not following along and distracting other kids. But he loves <br/>\ngoing. So I&#39;m thinking maybe I should try to let him know that if we&#39;re gonna <br/>\ngo, he kinda needs to go with the program, but that we don&#39;t have to go.<br/>\nI&#39;m not at all upset at what he&#39;s doing, don&#39;t know if I&#39;m wording this <br/>\nright. We dance and sing and have art at home and it&#39;s all fun and come and <br/>\ngo as you please. I disagree with some of the format of the class and I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure what we should do at this point. When we&#39;re in there I&#39;m feeling like <br/>\nI&#39;m expected to guide him into following these orders and he seems resistant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26012,"nextTopicId":26098}}
