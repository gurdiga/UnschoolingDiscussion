Daycare","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-968190720\">Welcome:-) <br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked.... &quot;would normal parenting be de-tached?&quot; Well if you mean normal as in what the &quot;norm&quot; in today&#39;s society is, I would say yes. Daycare at 6 weeks, preschool at 1 etc. is not natural in any way in my book. Attachment to me is just what it implies. Holding baby(sling or arms), nursing on demand,co-sleeping. No unnecessary seperation from the child. Just being there for them. Sure as toddlers want to explore they will leave the safety of their mothers arms, but will also return often for comfort. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways that is interesting info about the lyme&#39;s disease. I&#39;ve been amazed at the number of people I run across lately saying their children have been diagnosed with one of these diseases. Of course while I&#39;m sure the information you have about some underlying medical condition such as lyme disease causing some of the cases/symptoms I also believe that many children are being diagnosed just because they aren&#39;t meeting what society calls &quot;normal milestone development&quot;. My 6 year old for example was severly speech delayed by society&#39;s standards, and also had what is now often referred to as SID symptoms. He is improving on his speech regularly and becoming much more comfortable with textures and sticky fingers and the works as he ages. I think we live in a society of overdiansosis on many things simply by increased expectations of parents. Years ago these issues wouldn&#39;t of even been a problem because children weren&#39;t starting school at 3. I do realize some cases are very real and even very severe. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s the norm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m from NC btw. Do you have any idea what area you will be looking in?<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- From: Terri Reiser <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, March 12, 2004 10:24 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4534<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi I am new here and have been reading for a few weeks.
