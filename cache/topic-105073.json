I was in the other room and he came in and said “That <br/>\nlady has got that man’s sword in her herself!”  A couple of hours later he came <br/>\nand asked me about it, and I told him as simply as I could the story, and I <br/>\nexpected any minute he’d lose interest and that it would be enough, but he asked <br/>\nmore questions.  I explained some of it by saying that when he’s 16 and old <br/>\nenough to drive a car (that’s the big marker in his mind—16) that he might <br/>\nlove a girl so much his stomach hurt, and that Romeo and Juliet loved each other <br/>\nso much their stomachs hurt all the time.  He went with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTue, Apr 30, 1991  <br/>\nMarty likes to take the five Lego horses, put them in a big basket, and say <br/>\nthey’re his babies.  Kirby didn’t want him to do it today.  I made Kirby leave <br/>\nhim alone, and so Marty put the horses in the basket and I gave him a flannel <br/>\nbaby blanket, and he was very happy.  After a while, in the other room, I <br/>\nhear Kirby saying “You know what these are?  They’re not babies.  They’re just <br/>\ntoys.”  and I hear “tap tap tap”  like Kirby’s tapping on the plastic horse <br/>\nto emphasize that they’re not babies.  I called Kirby in where I was and said <br/>\n“don’t do that to Marty, that’s mean,” and Kirby said really pretty <br/>\ninnocently that Splinter was saying that, that Kirby wasn’t saying it, that he was just <br/>\nmaking Splinter say it.  I told Kirby it would be mean of me to say “This <br/>\nisn’t really Splinter, it’s just a toy,” and I tapped on his head with my <br/>\nfingernail.  He looked thoughtful, and said, “Well I can play with Splinter however <br/>\nI want to.”  “Okay, but you can’t play with Marty however you want to.  <br/>\nHow’s that?”    “Not very good.” he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby was nearly five,<br/>\nMarty was a year and a half old.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105064,"nextTopicId":105078}}
