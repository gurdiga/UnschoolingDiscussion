I think of the commercial of the Dad in the office supply store dancing with the shopping cart looking completely ecstatic.  He was shopping for school supplies for his moppy looking kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was me when I entered the Staples store and asked the clerk why they were so busy(it was 2:00 on a Tuesday)  She looked at me, and then at my four kids, and said (in a are you retarded? tone) &quot;School starts next week&quot; you could hear the &quot;Duh&quot; ringing in the air.  I smiled and said &quot;Oh Ya! Alex your friends will be back at school soon.&quot;  Big smile on my face :-D The poor clerk looked so confused.  Alex told her &quot;We&#39;re going to the cabin at the lake for September&quot;  Thinking it would help her understand. He added &quot;Well we waited to have our holidays for when my friends were stuck in school so they wouldn&#39;t miss me so much.&quot;  She still didn&#39;t get it.  &quot;We homeschool so we&#39;re free to holiday when we want.&quot;  She replied with a mystified &quot;Oh. Yaw. Ok sure&quot;  and we walked off.  Tee Hee.  I get my kids to ourselves for the days, it&#39;s so grand.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo our days will be quieter here in town and the Lake will be empty of noisy freaky kids who act insane now that they are free for two months.  Last year when we went there we had a few run ins with a gang of 7-9 yearolds that were reeking havoc in a big way.  Very scary.  It was like they had no idea how to think for themselves and so followed whatever nutty idea came to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I&#39;m ranting now.

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1370898236\">Well, like someone else said (was it the other Nancy?) things will probably <br/>\nbe slow on here this weekend, so I&#39;ll throw out what&#39;s going on at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic (government) school starts this coming Tuesday.  Our plans, so far, <br/>\nhave been to keep EVERYONE out...our biological kids, our adopted son, our <br/>\nfoster kids.  It would be the first time homeschooling for the last 3.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the last minute, our foster boy&#39;s caseworker said, &quot;No, they can&#39;t be <br/>\nhomeschooled until the adoption is final.&quot;  The reasoning, I suspect, is that <br/>\nbecause they are foster kids, if they are abused and not in school, no one would <br/>\nknow.  Other reasoning I guess is liability,...if they don&#39;t learn anything, or <br/>\nfall behind, the state could be held liable for not ensuring their continuing <br/>\neducation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we will be a house divided, which I HATE....means I&#39;ll be getting up <br/>\nat 6:00 am to get the boys on the bus, then wasting my evenings doing mindless <br/>\nhomework.  I really, really dread this.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other thing I have been up against, is that my 12 yo daughter, who <br/>\nwas in public school last year, really wants to go back.  She forgets the tears <br/>\nand crying at having to get up so early, the agony of doing all that <br/>\nhomework, never being able to go anywhere (we have friends who sell their wares at <br/>\nfairs and art shows and she had to decline going to many states and Canada <br/>\nbecause of this.)  My husband, believe it or not, has put his foot down and forbid <br/>\nanyone from going back, because the attitudes and stress were unbearable to the <br/>\nfamily, and whether they realize it or not, to the kids too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys will be coming out of school soon enough, once their adoption is <br/>\nfinal, probably a couple of months.  But if anyone would like to offer <br/>\nsuggestions of easing my daughter back into homeschooling (which will be really <br/>\ndifferent because she has only been schooled at home, not unschooled) PLEASE send them <br/>\nquickly my way.  She was somewhat accepting and looking forward to a lot of <br/>\nthings until 2 of her public school friends came back from vacation and started <br/>\ntouting all the wonderful things going on this year and how much she will <br/>\nmiss out on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom is coming to West Virginia for a month, and I am thinking of asking <br/>\nher to take Kelsey back to Texas with her for a couple of weeks as a treat and <br/>\nan eyeopener (she definately couldn&#39;t do that if she were in school)  Any other <br/>\nideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78900,"nextTopicId":79131}}
