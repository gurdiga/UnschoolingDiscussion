I&#39;ve known a few witnesses like that, but I&#39;ve<br/>\nalso known a few Baptists, Mormons, Wiccans, Victory<br/>\nLove goers, etc etc etc that are that way too. <br/>\nI&#39;m not. So it&#39;s insulting to me when people who are<br/>\nNOT me take it for granted that they know what my<br/>\nbeliefs and life are all about just cuz they hear the<br/>\nwords Jehovah&#39;s Witness. I&#39;m sure that people on the<br/>\nlist who consider themselves &quot;christian&quot; or &quot;pro-life&quot;<br/>\nare insulted by people thinking they are narrow minded<br/>\ninduviduals who are obviously misinformed. No more<br/>\nthan pro-choice people like to be labeled as<br/>\n&quot;murderers&quot;. Let&#39;s give each other a little credit<br/>\nhere.<br/>\nLet&#39;s not be judgmental and stereotype people becuz of<br/>\nwhat religious beliefs they have. That&#39;s just as bad<br/>\nas psers judging all of us on this list becuz of our<br/>\nschooling choices.
