I&#39;m not sure exactly why, but I think it&#39;s<br/>\nbecause he still has not admitted actually &quot;knowing&quot; about these cases, but<br/>\nsigned a paper saying he did, just so he could avoid prosecution - or<br/>\nsomthing like that.

He&#39;s been<br/>\ncharged with a class 4 felony (whatever that means). He faces up to 3 years<br/>\nand 9 months in prison if he&#39;s convicted of leaving the scene of the<br/>\naccident. He went to jail, he posted bail, he&#39;s at home now awaiting a<br/>\ntrial. He has resigned as bishop for Phoenix and the archbishop from Santa<br/>\nFe, NM (Michael Sheehan) is temporarily stepping in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husbands family is very Catholic. This is a very sore subject with them.<br/>\nMy husband (and other siblings) was baptised by Thomas O&#39;Brien. This hits<br/>\nhome for my in-laws. My husband also says he personally knew (and worked as<br/>\naltar boy) for some of the priests who have recently been charged with child<br/>\nmolesting many years ago.
