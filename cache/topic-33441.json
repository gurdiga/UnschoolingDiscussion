DH said Enron would<br/>\nbe &quot;dealt with.&quot;  The boys also said that they bet old Spin Doctor O&#39;Reilly<br/>\nwould stop talking about Enron and go back to hollering about Whitewater.<br/>\nThey won that bet also.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which was an unschooling moment because our neighbors were over that<br/>\nnight and their boys go to ps.

I was listening to Jeff Wayne&#39;s War of the Worlds the otehr<br/>\n&gt; day and Wyndham came in part way through the first disc.  He was<br/>\n&gt; instantly captivated by it.  I had to start the disc over so he could<br/>\n&gt; hear it from the beginning.  It&#39;s got really surreal music and a<br/>\n&gt; narrator telling the story with a few other characters who speak and<br/>\n&gt; sing.  It&#39;s kind of like a play on tape.<br/>\n&gt; I never thought Wyndham would be interested in it.  It just didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; seem like something he would sit through.  But he absolutely loves it<br/>\n&gt; and I suspect I will hear it a bit more than I want in the near<br/>\n&gt; future.  He&#39;s been singing a Wyndhamized version of one of the songs<br/>\n&gt; all day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jenni has discovered Anne Rice and is whipping through the<br/>\n&gt; non-vampire novels she wrote.
