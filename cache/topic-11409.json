While not as large as I am sure it will be one <br/>\n&gt;day, it is full of many more things than Pagan Childcare.  It has Playgroup <br/>\n&gt;listings, family ritual and holiday activities, links to Pagan <br/>\n&gt;homeschooling and Unschooling Website and message boards, and many other <br/>\n&gt;things.  It is a wonderful thing for a Pagan family like ours.
