Of course, maybe<br/>\nbecause they spent more time running around naked than they did in diapers<br/>\nand everyone was a real early walker.  The oldest was 12 months (daughter)<br/>\nand youngest was youngest son at a little over 7 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was easier, just MHO, because we never made a big deal out of it.<br/>\nI had a cutesy little combo stepping stool and potty chair in the bathroom.<br/>\nDD would come in and sit on &quot;her&quot; chair when I was in there.  The boys all<br/>\nwatched dad and thought &quot;making splashes&quot; was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if perhaps because they ran around naked more than half the time<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t more &quot;aware&quot; of what was happening and &quot;knew&quot; their bodies<br/>\nbetter?
