We quickly got a small one and went outside and were holding it. We <br/>\nwanted to leave something burning for awhile. . . seemed the right thing to <br/>\ndo. I remembered that Bryan had given me this candle for Christmas that was a <br/>\ntower looking thing (I guess it was a castle, but it looked like a tower. . . <br/>\nlike two of them actually). I found it and brought it outside, holding it <br/>\nreverently and we placed it at the end of the driveway, each of us silently <br/>\ngiving our own prayer/thought up to the universe . . . we stayed outside for <br/>\nawhile watching it and watching the planes flying overhead again . . .  it is <br/>\nstill lit at 11. . . I imagine that it will melt all the way and the towers <br/>\nwill be no more in the morning. I had thought about lighting it a few weeks <br/>\nago, and something told me no, there will be a better day. Tonight, it was. <br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25647,"nextTopicId":25684}}
