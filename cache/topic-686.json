It gives me a lot of hope and calms what I <br/>\nhave discovered as my own math anxiety in action on my son.  I will continue <br/>\nmy faith in his ability as scary as this is.  I mean he learned to walk <br/>\nwithout a workbook or an instructional video!  Amazing!<br/>\nNaticia<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/6/99 11:18:01 PM Pacific Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jules27278@...\">Jules27278@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jules27278@...\">Jules27278@...</a><br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;-Wesley is very good at math and he likes it a lot.
