He will put himself to <br/>\nbed even if the rest of us are up and he is always the first up in the <br/>\nmorning.

We started waking up by about 6:30 and sometimes I even wake up at <br/>\n5 or 5:30.  This has become my new reading time.  My 15 yr old, who was <br/>\nresistant to the idea (but I asked him to just try it for a week or two as an <br/>\nexperiment) actually said he feels a lot better.  I like the early morning <br/>\nquite a lot and felt like I was missing it before.  Also, it felt like my <br/>\ndays were flying by too fast.

When I did<br/>\ngo to college, they wanted me to pick a major by my junior<br/>\nyear but I wanted to pick & choose the courses that I would<br/>\ntake.  In the end it all worked out but I had forgotten all<br/>\nof that until this year when my fourth grader complained<br/>\nabout boredom.  She also asked if she could learn at home.<br/>\nShe hates school, gets straight a&quot;s and makes no effort.<br/>\nThe most fun she has is when she has to do a project. She is<br/>\nable to be creative and puts much more effort forth.  Based<br/>\non what I&#39;ve seen she would benefit greatly.  My 6 year old<br/>\ndaughter is a highly social creature so that may be tough.<br/>\nShe has a great teacher but that won&#39;t always be the case.<br/>\nShe will be the one who resists the homeschooling.
