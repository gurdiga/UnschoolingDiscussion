While they were playing near<br/>\nme, the friend tells my daughter that something &quot;funny&quot; happened in school<br/>\ntoday. Keep in mind that the friend is in 5th grade (my oldest would be in<br/>\n4th). She said that her teacher had thrown chalk at a kid in math class<br/>\ntoday...breaking it on the kid&#39;s head! Although I grew up in the public<br/>\nschool system--and have actually SEEN this type of thing happen many<br/>\ntimes--I was still shocked. (Partly because this had happened when I was in<br/>\nHigh School ...and I guess I never expected it to happen in a grade school.)<br/>\nI know that many people don&#39;t have the patience it takes to deal with<br/>\nkids...and I know that even those with lots of patience can get upset and<br/>\n&quot;lose it&quot; at times with a child they feel is especially trying...but this is<br/>\nridiculous! And, I know that nothing will be done about it--THAT&#39;S the worst<br/>\npart! And the thing that makes this even worse in my mind, is that this is<br/>\nthe same school (my oldest used to attend it) that swore to me it was the<br/>\nabsolute best! They hyped up their &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; status and so on and so<br/>\nforth! (They also got the &quot;Star School&quot; honor!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it seems I am blowing this out of proportion a bit...but there are<br/>\nmany other incidents (of varying types) before this one--I suppose this one<br/>\nis just the proverbial straw.<br/>\n<br/>\n~`*S*`~ <br/>\n<br/>\n*~* Want a beautiful, inexpensive heirloom your family will treasure for<br/>\ngenerations to come? <br/>\nAsk me for details!<br/>\n--Be your own Detective!
