I tried highlighting<br/>\npassages and book marking pages for him in the books but that is just not<br/>\nhim. He is far more likely to read anything if it is shining out of a<br/>\nscreen, or in a magazine of which he consumes many each month. I get Life<br/>\nLearning delivered. If your dh likes reading books - hurrah!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce when I tried to give him something to look at, he said grumpily, &quot;Is<br/>\nthat another book for you to criticize me with?&quot; I realized that my<br/>\n&quot;instructing him&quot; attitude to unschooling was not helping anyone. Now I do<br/>\nmore by e-mail, and tell him I have sent him something funny or really<br/>\ninteresting *to me* that he might enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly: I&#39;m sure you have been reading the several threads on the<br/>\nfrustrations people have changing from one parenting system to another, and<br/>\nletting go of restrictions. It is a whole lifestyle, not just the going to<br/>\nschool part. Every time one these threads comes up I am so glad we started<br/>\nalmost from the beginning of Jayn&#39;s (4) life with these ideas, that flowed<br/>\nnaturally from attachment parenting for us. She is sometimes wild, and has<br/>\ndone what might be termed &quot;naughty&quot; things with poured liquids - her<br/>\nfavorite playtoy is water - but she is so much fun, and has no fear of us in<br/>\nher eyes. I urge him to go to the conference because hearing people speak is<br/>\nso much easier for some kinds of learners (Multiple intelligences and all<br/>\nthat) than reading things. My dh was already (before Jayn was born) an<br/>\nanti-spanker (as was I) and anti-shouter (which I had to learn to be, from<br/>\nmy own reading to find the many alternatives, and from him and his support).<br/>\n<br/>\nAw gee, I wish he was home, I&#39;d go give him a big hug and kiss. Jayn is<br/>\nstill snoozing so I don&#39;t want to wake her yet. (50 emails to go!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I really want to go to the conference now that everyone <br/>\nhere has been explaining about it so much!  We talked about it last night.  He <br/>\nwas wondering what the kids will do at the conference.  I did explain that <br/>\nit&#39;s not a conference like at work... but did suggest things like take the kids <br/>\nto the pool to swim, play with other kids, etc.  I would love for us to attend <br/>\nas a family but am wondering if I could get more out of it by myself or just <br/>\nwith dh and have the kids play with grandma for the weekend.  I do want my <br/>\nhusband to attend, the conference would give him a chance to meet other families <br/>\nfor whom this WORKS!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough he is not sure about just how unschooling would work, I think he has <br/>\nat least come around to the idea that NOT sending them to school is the way <br/>\nto go.  I give him examples from my previous life as a special ed teacher all <br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have asked him to at least read a few books about unschooling since I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I always explain it so well.  He&#39;s thinking that the kids are still <br/>\nyoung(3 1/2 & 1), why do we need to make this decision now?  I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking...Kindergarten in ps would be  just another year away.  I want him to be on board to <br/>\nthis idea as much as I am because I&#39;m sure it would be very hard for a family <br/>\nto unschool if only one parent is &quot;into&quot; it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it&#39;s not too far to drive, I think we will go!  Also...for those of you <br/>\nwho are making a vacation out of it...there are tons of things to do in that <br/>\narea.  For young kids, the Boston Children&#39;s Museum is great.  As well as several <br/>\nother museums in Boston and of course checking out Cape Cod.<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88467,"nextTopicId":88541}}
