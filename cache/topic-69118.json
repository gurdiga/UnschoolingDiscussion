I think I look upon her when I <br/>\nlook in my daughters&#39; eyes because part of the reason she ended up <br/>\nthe way she did IMHO was because of being passed around like she was <br/>\ndamaged goods when she was young. So it had an HUGE impact on how I <br/>\nparent, the mate I chose to be with, what I believe.... EVERYTHING <br/>\nabout who I am today.<br/>\nAnd I always said that I think it impacted me the most.

My brother died a year and a half <br/>\nago.  (I didn&#39;t find your post snotty at all, btw. &lt;g&gt;)  When Hillary was <br/>\nborn, she weighed 8 pounds 4 ounces.  She looked perfect in every way, <br/>\nalthough she had lost deep layers of skin and lacked muscle and cartilage <br/>\ntone due to the fact that she passed away a week before birth, so her head <br/>\nwas very relaxed and would sort of flatten out in my hands when I held her.  <br/>\nWe had an extensive autopsy performed and genetic testing which revealed no <br/>\nanswers as to the reason of why she died.  (I now wish I hadn&#39;t chosen to do <br/>\nthose things.)  I realize that it is a different kind of not knowing, but <br/>\nthat has plagued me for the past 10 years.  Losing my brother also had a <br/>\ntremendous affect on my life, very similar to losing Hillary.  Losing him <br/>\ngreatly changed my views in dealing with loved ones.
