I got in a <br/>\nhuge  &quot;discussion&quot; on a pre-unschooling list about not controlling tv <br/>\nand  food.  I said I didn&#39;t control these things because I respected <br/>\nmy  son as a whole person who knew what he wanted and needed.  Many of  <br/>\nthe other posters got really upset about this and said that they  <br/>\nrespected their kids too and that that was why they controlled what  <br/>\nthey ate and watched.  I said that wasn&#39;t respect, that was distrust  <br/>\nand control.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe different people have different  definitions of what respect <br/>\nis?
