Probably most people<br/>\nin the U.S. have seen some porn in their lives.  Very few have problems with<br/>\nit.

Very few, relatively,<br/>\nhave problems with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting overly involved in any activity that is detrimental to the person or<br/>\ntheir relationships is a symptom.  It isn&#39;t the root of the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 9 yo son just saw Dolly Parton for the first time the other night.  He<br/>\nsaid,&quot;Her boobs are HUGE!!!  They are lots bigger than the ones on Bay<br/>\nWatch.&quot;  So the sexual element isn&#39;t lost even on pre-pre-pubescent kids.<br/>\nThat said, when any of my kids are doing ANYTHING that makes me<br/>\nuncomfortable or that makes me concerned for their well-being, I talk with<br/>\nthem.  I ask questions. I tell them how I view the situation.  I draw<br/>\nparallels.  I work very hard not to shame or forbid.
