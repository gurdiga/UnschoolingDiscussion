Meaning they have to tell <br/>\nme how they couldn&#39;t live without their cars and justify all the times they <br/>\nuse it and all the places they have to drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care. I really don&#39;t. I&#39;m not always sure why people do this. I <br/>\nunderstand that most people need cars, really *need* them to get to work <br/>\nand get around. Many cities are really hard to get around by bus or foot or <br/>\nbike, and in a rural area you don&#39;t get around at all without a car. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want one right now and have made choices that make not having a car <br/>\neasier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe belong to a carshare with (so far) only one car, and it is parked about <br/>\n5 kilometres across the bridge from my house,so I don&#39;t use it much. Some <br/>\nbig cities like Toronto and Montreal have carshares with cars throughout <br/>\nthe city. The best thing about belonging to the carshare is we have a <br/>\ncorporate account with a car rental company that gives us reduced rates and <br/>\npreferred service. We use that frequently when the weather is good. We go <br/>\ncamping, to my family&#39;s cottage, the zoo, my in-laws in Cape Breton, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m almost sure we will buy another car in the near future, when the <br/>\nbenefits outweigh the costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDonna Andrea in Nova Scotia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: cars Re: DeFooding","postDate":"1049252830","msgId":62643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZjkwMWMyZjhjNCRmNDIxMGI4MCQwNTAwMDAwYUBtYWJiLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGI2Y2RhaitoNzAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NS4xLjEuNS4xLjIwMDMwNDAxMTcwOTA1LjAwYTdmYjkwQHBvcDEubnMuc3ltcGF0aWNvLmNhPiA8MDA4ZTAxYzJmODk5JGNkYTE3MzMwJDA1MDAwMDBhQG1hYmIubmV0PiA8MDAwYzAxYzJmODlmJDNiMzRjZGMwJDYxMDFhOGMwQGxhdW5jaG1vZGVtLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62620,"nextInTopic":62663,"prevInTime":62642,"nextInTime":62644,"topicId":62620,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... been ...
