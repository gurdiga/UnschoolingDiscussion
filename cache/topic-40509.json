Of course just about everyone would agree that there have to be limits on how educational money could be spent. (If there&#39;s someone here who wants to try to justify parents spending their vouchers at Bob&#39;s House-&#39;O-Whiskey and the the !LIVE!GIRLS! Adult Book and Video store, don&#39;t let me stop you.) <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are ways to present this to the public so that they think they came up with the idea of restricting use of vouchers to &quot;regular&quot; bookstores, educational supply stores, curriculum vendors, etc. <br/>\n <br/>\nThere is one hitch, and that&#39;s that bugaboo about &quot;religious&quot; materials. Frankly, I think that lots of stuff that doesn&#39;t look &quot;religious&quot; can be shown to support one or another spiritual worldview (consider those Pagans who claim science and math as sacred arts), but it wouldn&#39;t bother me too much if the skittish public struck out such funding -- there&#39;s plenty of other stuff that parents could use that money for. <br/>\n <br/>\nParity would require all kids in a school district to be granted the same amount of money, depending maybe on age. Voters in the district would decide how much each kid got. Kids with special needs would be identified by the district (or to the district), and their needs would be met via a special fund. Schools would have no gain in over-identifying special needs kids, since they have no guarantee that their schools would get the money. <br/>\n <br/>\n(Actually, to make this really work, all public school become charter schools, and no kids is ever automatically sent to a particular school. All  public schools in a given area -- say, a county -- are open-enrollment. And all compete with private schools.) <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve been saying this on the Internet for more than 10 years now, but to this day I haven&#39;t been made Queen of the World, so it hasn&#39;t happened.

You don&#39;t just get <br/>\nmoney without having to account for it.  Ideally we should get the <br/>\nmoney for our children that is being spent on other citizens <br/>\nchildren, but I don&#39;t see how that could come without a cost of <br/>\nanother kind.  I don&#39;t want to have to account to anyone and when you <br/>\naccept money from the government, there is accountability.  Why would <br/>\nwe want to bring that on ourselves?  <br/>\nI chose to take my children out of the system and i don&#39;t want <br/>\nanything else to do with it.  Asking for our fair share comes with a <br/>\nwhole lot more than we are bargaining for.  there is no getting <br/>\naround that.<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86177500,"authorName":"SeaweedMom7474@aol.com","from":"SeaweedMom7474@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:  2217 - the voucher reasoning","postDate":"1028940996","msgId":40521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2LmZkODc2OWYuMmE4NWJlYzRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40509,"nextInTopic":40530,"prevInTime":40520,"nextInTime":40522,"topicId":40509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"doesn t the school get 4000 bucks per enrolled student from the federal gov.?
