I know how lines of communication can shut down between teens <br/>\nand their folks, and I think it is one of the biggest problems that <br/>\nexist.  Kids need the counsel of their more experienced parents, but the <br/>\nparties are so angry at each other that they cannot talk.  Kids go through <br/>\nthings, and their folks aren&#39;t there for them.   It seems to me that <br/>\nthrough your son&#39;s songwriting, he is taking you into his confidence; this <br/>\nis a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike it or not, your son has strong feelings, and he is expressing them for <br/>\nyou in a way that he can.  The first thing I would say is that you may want <br/>\nto be sure to keep the lines of communication open.  His songs and the <br/>\nthings he is expressing are great inroads to further discussion about these <br/>\nissues.  In other words, rather than remarking on the strong language, you <br/>\ncould open a discussion by saying, &quot;Those are strong feelings,&quot; or <br/>\nsomething like that.  In other words, if his song is about life sucking, <br/>\nthen that&#39;s something you can talk with him about.  Perhaps life doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to suck.  Or perhaps you can help him deal with his life in ways that <br/>\nwill make him feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t go back and unexpose him to the material he has already been <br/>\nexposed to; there&#39;s no point focusing on that.   But you can help him with <br/>\nhis feelings.  Or, you can just listen to them without judgment.  I know <br/>\nthat may be really difficult for you and may offend your sensibilities, but <br/>\nit may be the difference of him no longer letting you in when he needs you <br/>\nand him taking you into his confidence and you being able to head off <br/>\nreally scary things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if this is coming across they way I mean it to.

My suggestion would be that you separate the two. Let him <br/>\nknow what you think and why you think it--vulgar lyrics, violence, etc., <br/>\nbut give him the freedom to make his own choices. I suspect once he <br/>\nrealizes the choices are *really* his, some of the atraction will wane. <br/>\nAt the same time, though, he doesn&#39;t have to listen to it at &quot;fill the <br/>\nhouse&quot; volume or in the room you&#39;re in. You want to make sure, though, <br/>\nthat in distancing yourself from music you dislike and disapprove of, <br/>\nyou don&#39;t dislike or disapprove of him. Sharing some of it together may <br/>\nlead to some important communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I am having trouble deciding in general where one draws lines.

My 12 <br/>\n&gt;year old is very strong willed and seems to enjoy being shocking at times. He <br/>\n&gt;is also very angry.

Obviously, I <br/>\n&gt;can tell him, it is a retorical question really.  It is  difficult to ban <br/>\n&gt;such things because  I cannot stop his being exposed to them.
