They fit their pants just right and then suddenly they need a belt and their ankles are showing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree with you, though, Sandra, about modeling right behavior.  My daughter doesn&#39;t even remember my being thin until I show her pictures and then she thinks I look so pretty.  So, now, I take her to the gym with me.  Though she&#39;s not allowed on the machines, she sees me doing it 6 days a week, and understands its importance.  She knows it&#39;s to lose weight, too, though.  Thankfully, Margaux doesn&#39;t have a weight problem at all.  She&#39;s just a normal sized girl.  Many of her friends are really skinny, though.  I don&#39;t think Margaux has ever compared her body to her friends&#39;.  She&#39;s just 6 years old.  I hope to be able to keep her from feeling she needs to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Margaux is also a very picky eater, but almost everything she eats is perfectly healthy.  She likes candy, but she would rather have some gummy fruit snacks... sometimes she&#39;ll want to eat 20 packs of them in a row.  I ask her if she feels sick on all that.  She always says no, so I don&#39;t tell her not to eat it.  But I can&#39;t/don&#39;t buy her 5 boxes a week.  She eats them when we have them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

But this sounds like very good advice for<br/>\nthose that do or for those that want to switch to a different way of eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who is concerned with herself, her husband and son. Both<br/>\nfamilies are overweight to the point of having gastric bypasses. Her son is<br/>\nlarge. She started this same way too. By buying gradually healthier foods<br/>\nand making them readily available and appealing to her son. She will buy<br/>\noccasional &quot;dessert&quot; type items in small quantities. Her son knows that they<br/>\nare occasional but that he also can eat what he wants of them. At first he<br/>\nwould finish the whole box or package and now he saves some for later.

I struggle with <br/>\ncompulsive eating too.  My whole family is &quot;defooding&quot;, and have been <br/>\nfor some time.

Or how about this one,<br/>\n&quot;Oh, Kelli, you really shouldn&#39;t have that.&quot;   What a way to mold a young<br/>\nperson.   I worried all the time about what I was going to eat and whether<br/>\nor not I&#39;d be fat or unhealthy.    Since letting those things go, I&#39;ve<br/>\ndropped my extra weight.   People used to ask me,  &quot;what are you doing,<br/>\nyou&#39;ve lost weight&quot;!   I said,  I&#39;ve just started eating,   eating what I<br/>\nwant and listened to my body more.   I was letting go of the emotional<br/>\nbaggage around food.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel very strongly about allowing our children to develop their own eating<br/>\npatterns.  Sure we talk about this food and that.  Like what Donna Andrea<br/>\nsaid:  the fiber thing,  what vitamins are in what foods, stuff like that.<br/>\nBut, by decriminalizing the food there won&#39;t be that attraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was younger,  around 8 years ago.   I limited and only bought<br/>\ncertain things.   When he would have the chance, be at other&#39;s houses,  he<br/>\nwould choose the &quot;junk foods&quot; and sodas as much as he could.   If we only<br/>\nprovide certain types of food in our houses how are they going to know how<br/>\nto make their own choices?   What are they going to do away from home?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last year or so, since we&#39;ve lifted those restrictions he did go<br/>\nthrough a phase where he  drank several sodas a day.  But he will now stop<br/>\nhimself,  I&#39;ll hear him say, &quot;hmm, I&#39;m thirsty,  I&#39;m going to have a Dew,<br/>\nno, well, maybe just some juice.  No,  chocolate milk sounds good.&quot;<br/>\nSometimes he&#39;ll just grab a water bottle.   I do try to keep water bottles<br/>\nfull and in the refridgerator,  much easier to grab than the glass in the<br/>\ncupboard!  &lt;g&gt;   Water tastes so good right out of the fridge!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,,,,<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy,  keep chuggin&#39; away.   You will get through this!   Just keep saying<br/>\nto yourself that they will end up choosing what is good for them.   That<br/>\nmight not always be what is good in your eyes.   Right now my son is big on<br/>\ncorndogs!  I&#39;m not a big meat eater, so this doesn&#39;t sound good to me.   But<br/>\nthey will figure it out,  they&#39;ll see how they feel and will want to feel<br/>\ngood.

When we took on unschooling a few months ago, I naturally fell into defooding.  Margaux eats whatever she wants to eat, pretty much, but we are now exercising a lot more than we had done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined It Figures, and Margaux has a yard now and a few active friends with whom she runs and plays all day most days.  I think the exercise is definitely helping me.  It&#39;s a little reminder to grab the carrots instead of the crackers, but I know I can still eat the crackers if I want to because I&#39;m working out 6 times a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the pop, my husband and I both drink a lot of soda.  Margaux doesn&#39;t drink very much.  She prefers skim milk, water, or orange juice.  The Tropicana orange juice with Lots &#39;o Pulp is her favorite and she usually finishes off a half gallon of it within two days.  We just get one of those each grocery period so I don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShahram (my DH) and I drink diet soda, but my friend has been urging me to get off of it.  I&#39;ve noticed that some sodas make us want more than others.  For instance, when Shahram and I split a can of Diet Sam&#39;s Choice Caffeine free Cola, we want another right away, and perhaps even a third.  When we split a can of Diet Lemon Pepsi Twist, we are satisfied with only one.  Would your husband be amenable to switching types of soda?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing in staying healthy and maintain or reducing to a healthy weight is daily exercise.  Without daily movement, when we are dieting to lose weight, we are losing muscle, and that includes heart muscle.  So, make sure to exercise daily for at least 20 minutes.  Of course, ask your doctor before beginning any fitness program.  ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps some.<br/>\nNichole<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LOWRIEK@...\">LOWRIEK@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, June 18, 2003 12:54 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Help with Defooding Again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know this one keeps coming up.

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how it will work for you, but I have found that many things lose <br/>\ntheir appeal if I am truly allowed to have them. I realized a few days ago <br/>\nthat I was only eating foods because I chose them, not because they were <br/>\n&quot;good for me&quot; or because I was feeling bad and wanted to stuff myself with <br/>\nsomething &quot;bad.&quot; I still eat oreos but only a few because that is how many <br/>\nI want. There was a time when I wouldn&#39;t start to eat certain foods because <br/>\nI knew I couldn&#39;t stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI raised my sons with few food restrictions and they make varied and <br/>\nhealthy choices everyday.

It may be hard for your son to <br/>\nunderstand the defooding if his dad is emotionally attached to his pop. <br/>\nThen again, with no restrictions some people may still drink large amounts <br/>\nof something or other. Again, I think everything has to be available. One <br/>\nthing I do with my kids and husband is pass on what I learn about nutrition <br/>\nto them.

Usually, once I explain why I am opposed to certain things (ie. we avoid dyes in foods because they cause behavioral problems in kids, or we only eat whole grain breads because they clean our colons, or these fruits help make our immune system strong...) they are all for it. They know I am notorious for my research, and when they understand the reason behind my decisions, they actually back them. I love to hear them explaining these things to their friends! And the friends find it a novelty (Yeah, all their food is ORGANIC). lol!Their friends also are enthralled that I make everything from scratch, and they love to help me.

My niece doesn&#39;t find it so endearing, however! <br/>\nI do allow the occasional soda, as I don&#39;t want to be a dictator, but they realize it&#39;s a special treat.

I <br/>\nbuy fresh fruits and veggies as the bulk of my purchase.  I don&#39;t believe <br/>\ncutting out carbs so I buy only whole wheat breads, crackers, pastas, etc.  <br/>\n*If* I buy anything &#39;less than&#39; I only buy what we will eat in one sitting.  <br/>\nA few days ago, I bought a small bag of cookies.  We each had 3 and the bag <br/>\nwas empty.  When I buy cokes, er uh, pops (sorry, in Texas they are all <br/>\ncokes! lol) I only buy enough for each of us to have one.  In this respect, <br/>\nit&#39;s nice that my husband  is gone so much of the time.  He grumbles about <br/>\nmy newly acquired healthy food choices but he has the option of buying junk <br/>\nfood himself when he is out.  I ask him to please not bring things like that <br/>\nhome and for the most part, he is happy to oblige.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are slowly switching to a more raw diet but I also find that only buying <br/>\nfoods that require cooking makes me less tempted to rush in and gobble up <br/>\nsomething just because I feel like eating.  If I am truly hungry, I tend to <br/>\ngo ahead and cook.  If not, I tend to eat fruit or grab a glass of water <br/>\ninstead.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuying bottled water has been a big help.  I tend to go for that now rather <br/>\nthan food or junk drinks.  It is convenient and icey cold.  Phasing out <br/>\njuices has been another goal which the bottled water helps with too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know the number, but in the last month or so I have definitely lost <br/>\nweight.  My clothes are getting loose and I FEEL so much better!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have struggled as long as I can remember with my weight and eating habits. <br/>\n  Learning more about nutrition and changing my shopping habits has done <br/>\nwonders for me!<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren and adults who consume too many cokes are at risk for a lot of <br/>\nproblems.  Though not all are severe, they have the potential to become so.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t have to tell my kids no about cokes if they aren&#39;t right there in <br/>\nthe fridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to look at your shopping habits and begin there.  Fill your <br/>\nfridge with water and fresh, raw fruits and veggies.  Splurge on Ranch and <br/>\nyogurt to dip them in.  Don&#39;t buy quick foods, prepackaged foods, etc.  <br/>\nBesides the lure of a quick fix, they aren&#39;t nearly as healthy and some are <br/>\neven harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
