That was enough, once he read the information it <br/>\nwas difficult to argue with me and now he talks like it was his <br/>\nidea..LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are having trouble maybe focus on one topic which is causing <br/>\nproblems, bedtime, more freedom, the problems with the institution <br/>\nof school.  Sometimes I break in my dh slowly by just mentioning <br/>\nthings discussed on this list, pulling out little excerpts or <br/>\nreading him a paragraph from a book.  I have tried to give him books <br/>\nto read but he is busy and they never get read which led to me feel <br/>\nresentful about him not being not part of the decision making.  Now, <br/>\nI respect that I make more of the decisions but by cueing him into <br/>\nwhat we are doing he feels some control.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, with bedtime routines I just didn&#39;t make a big deal <br/>\nabout putting the kids to bed and then I discussed some of the <br/>\ninformation I had gotten from here.   Even with homeschooling in <br/>\ngeneral, I read the books and gave him the synopsis qouting the <br/>\nreally &quot;great&quot; stuff.  Especially if I got to a real intersting <br/>\npart, I would say &quot;LISTEN TO THIS!&quot;  which is more sharing <br/>\nthan &quot;teaching&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree with Julie that my dh felt a little left out for a while <br/>\nwith us getting to go the zoo and parks, etc. and him stuck working <br/>\nso defintiley making him feel important helps.  Right now Keiran, my <br/>\n5yo, is playing Zelda with his Dad.  My dh feels special because <br/>\nthis is their thing and he can&#39;t wait for Dad to come home.  Bedtime <br/>\ngoes later and later because he is playing and wants Keiran there <br/>\nwith him.  It is really rather cute.  A few times Keiran has fallen <br/>\nasleep and my dh wanted to wake him up to show him something.  I had <br/>\nto remind him that he was tired enough..LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe in small doses of  sharing information and making him feel <br/>\na bit more a part of the group might help.  Also, if you have always <br/>\nbeleived in doing something one way it is hard to do it different <br/>\nespecially without the resources of books and groups like this so it <br/>\nis harder for husbands IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  But lately they feel he is so unfair (and I do too) <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and don&#39;t even want to be around him.

However....he is<br/>\nmuch more strict than I and it is really beginning to cause problems.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first began making changes and giving the kids a lot more freedom and<br/>\nchoice, Mark was worried  and we had quite a few heated discussions.
