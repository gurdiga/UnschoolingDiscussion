We browsed through various &quot;how to&quot; books on line and she <br/>\npicked the &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; book. She did about the middle third of that book. <br/>\nWhich I think is important. That we didn&#39;t do every page and feel obligated to <br/>\nstart at the beginning or finish it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we have tons and tons of books around. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now she reads -- it took about a year for enough things to click that she <br/>\nwas an independent reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also will add in that we are not among the &quot;reading a book under the <br/>\ncovers crowd.&quot; DS reads the papers and when he needs to read to do something. He <br/>\nhas never enjoyed fiction. DD likes a good story but isn&#39;t obsessed about it <br/>\n-- she&#39;ll take out a few books a week from the library (another good reading <br/>\ntool btw - your own library card :) ) and likes to read but isn&#39;t about to <br/>\ntackle Harry Potter. Sometimes I read posts online and they seem to suggest that <br/>\nkids across America are in bed with Harry P and that just isn&#39;t so in this <br/>\nhouse. And that&#39;s just fine. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nNance <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85544,"nextTopicId":85520}}
