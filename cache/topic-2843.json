As it turned out, we did make it out <br/>\nto lunch at Pizza Hut, where I taught the boys how to figure out a 15% tip.  <br/>\nThere, Math done for the day.  I also made them tell me what food groups were <br/>\npart of their pizza and their salads.  I guess that was Health class.  :-)  <br/>\nOn our way to go grocery shopping, the transmission in my car quit working.  <br/>\nWe had to push the car to park it (Adam thought it was SO cool that he got to <br/>\nsit in the driver&#39;s seat and steer).  A kindly old gentlemen who lived across <br/>\nthe street from where we broke down came over to help me.  I learned how to <br/>\nopen the hood, check the fan belt and the oil.  (That was Auto Repair class <br/>\nfor me)  Then this wonderful elderly man gave my four children and me a ride <br/>\nhome.  He had hymns playing on his cassette player, and when the children and <br/>\nI started singing along, I think we made his day.  He sure made mine!  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t even know his name, but I know where he lives, and I plan on bringing <br/>\ndinner over there as soon as my car gets fixed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, it was a blessed day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJill<br/>\nHomeschooling Mom to Adam, Greg, Sheila & Amy<br/>\nAdopted Mom to 2 dogs, 7 cats, 2 rabbits and a parakeet<br/>\nIndependent Typing Contractor and Church Secretary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2718,"nextTopicId":2848}}
