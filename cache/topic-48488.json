That made me laugh.  Loudly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey never said boo about constipation or brown pills  I hadn&#39;t eaten in days <br/>\nthough...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law is the most nonjudgmental person I&#39;ve ever met.  She&#39;s <br/>\nconservative and opinionated, but overwhelmingly respectful.  My father in <br/>\nlaw was a UCC minister, yet they never asked why the kids weren&#39;t baptized, <br/>\nthey respected and didn&#39;t question our judgment.  About hsing (we haven&#39;t <br/>\ntried to explain unschooling), she thinks its great.  She&#39;s a retired <br/>\nschoolteacher - 1st grade.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;d rather she empty my commode than my own <br/>\nmum!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole concept of losing one&#39;s self-consciousness is an interesting one.  <br/>\nI think a lot of us are more comfortable taking care of someone else than <br/>\nbeing taken care of...<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48487,"nextTopicId":47838}}
