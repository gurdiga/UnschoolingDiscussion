Our kids grow up around wine -- and other alcohol -- and learn to <br/>\ntreat it with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n         There is a similarly low level of alcoholism in other cultures <br/>\nthat treat wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages as either ritual items <br/>\nor ordinary parts of family dinners. Some people would say that it is <br/>\nbecause there is no need to go sneaking alcohol as a teen if you know you <br/>\ncan have it openly.

It seems I&#39;ve already stirred up some <br/>\ncontroversy, so i didn&#39;t want to stick my foot in it again, but as a Jew I <br/>\nalso had a very different view point and approach to circumcision for my <br/>\nboys. It should be noted, though, that the experience for a Jewish family <br/>\nis VERY different from that of a non-Jewish family. Many of the things that <br/>\npeople are concerned about and have discussed here are simply not an issue <br/>\nin a religious &quot;bris&quot;. For anyone interested, I&#39;d like to share the <br/>\nexperience. If you aren&#39;t interested, now would be a good time to hit the <br/>\ndelete button.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore my youngest son was born, I already knew that he was a boy. That <br/>\nmeant that I had plenty of time to talk to the mohel (man responsible for <br/>\nthe actual circumcision ritual) and the rabbi in our community, as well as <br/>\ntime to pick out the people who would be given the various honors in the <br/>\nritual. Many in our community had the mohel go to their house for the bris, <br/>\nbut we opted for the bris to be held in the tiny synagogue, since it was <br/>\nnear our home and also had easier access than our own house for the guests <br/>\nwho would come. The Saturday morning after my son was born, the date and <br/>\ntime of the bris was announced in the synagogue service and anyone in the <br/>\ncommunity who wished to celebrate with us was invited. On the eighth day <br/>\nafter Andrew&#39;s birth, all of the extended family, our closest friends, and <br/>\na number of people from our community came to the synagogue for the bris. <br/>\nSince it was an orthodox community, the area was gender divided, with men <br/>\nonly on the side of the sanctuary where the actual bris was held. Women <br/>\nwere on the other side of a hip-high divide -- most of them around me to <br/>\nkeep my mind off what they were doing on the other side! One man, who would <br/>\nhold Andrew throughout the ceremony, was sitting up on a sturdy desk that <br/>\nhad been dragged out of the rabbi&#39;s study. My mother brought Andrew into <br/>\nthe sanctuary on a special pillow, and handed him to the friend, and then <br/>\njoined me in the women&#39;s section. A few prayers were said. Andrew was given <br/>\na sip of kosher wine. And another. (The wine is both a part of many Jewish <br/>\nrituals and a form of anesthetic in this case.) Some more prayers were <br/>\nsaid, my husband was asked what the baby&#39;s name would be, a declaration to <br/>\nall of those gathered was made as to the name of the child and that he was <br/>\na Jewish child, entering into the covenant of his father and his father&#39;s <br/>\nfathers. More wine went down the kid&#39;s gullet throughout this period as our <br/>\nfriend stuck his finger in a glass of wine and then into Andrew&#39;s mouth to <br/>\nsuck. The circumcision was done with great care in more or less the manner <br/>\nin which little boys have been circumcised for 3000 years in our <br/>\ncommunities. Andrew let out one quick yowl,and then went back to sucking <br/>\nthe sweet wine off of our friend&#39;s finger. Final blessings were recited. <br/>\nThen some more wine was drunk, this time by the grown ups. Andrew was given <br/>\nback to me, thoroughly happy, and a bit sticky with wine.<br/>\n<br/>\n         As you can tell, this is nothing like the experience of a hospital <br/>\ncircumcision. There is much love and care, the baby is definitely <br/>\nanesthetized, and there is no stage in the process when the baby is not <br/>\nbeing held, cuddled, or at the very least touched by loving hands. A <br/>\nnon-Jewish friend of mine who was there commented about how lovely the <br/>\nritual had been and how wonderful it must be to have community and <br/>\ntraditions such as these. I fully agree -- if it were not so I would not be <br/>\na part of the traditions as an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n         But if you are not Jewish, are circumcisions necessary? Probably <br/>\nnot. They may be a good idea, though. There is still debate about the <br/>\nrelative benefits and drawbacks. So, for those who feel that they are a <br/>\ngood idea, I would suggest taking a page out of the Jewish ritual...  Don&#39;t <br/>\nlet your son be circumcised all alone in a hospital. Make sure that at the <br/>\nvery least you are there with him.  And if you would consider a birth at <br/>\nhome a good thing, then maybe a circumcision at home is a good thing too.<br/>\n<br/>\n- elizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What we need are more people who specialize in the impossible.&quot;<br/>\n                                      -- Theodore Roethke, poet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"8X9iqV0anZl-GkGe4cnMFN2DP85Pb7mhgP5Cx0770GkHejwMI3WAoc4ULVBgbD5nD2x4V9o9lvW_Y_8GL7UfUhqzXDysMugA2nE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Vaccinations/Circumcision","postDate":"997592465","msgId":23155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMDgxMTIxNTkzMS4wMGEyYTdjMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxNjNRRGlRWmlSQnZuTkllZTQwMDAwNDdmNkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23147,"nextInTopic":23243,"prevInTime":23154,"nextInTime":23156,"topicId":23093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have a friend<br/>\n&gt;whose husband is a chiropractor and none of their children are vaccinated,<br/>\n&gt;have ever seen a doctor (other than him), all homeschooled, home birth, all<br/>\n&gt;natural food... So I ask her one day &quot;so if you are all so natural <br/>\n&gt;presumably<br/>\n&gt;you didn&#39;t mutilate your son by having him circumcised?&quot;  she looked and<br/>\n&gt;looked at me and didn&#39;t say anything and then I said &quot;Oh I forget we live <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;America where it&#39;s a cultural thing to mutilate your boys&quot;...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wonder how many people who live this &quot;natural life&quot; have done that to <br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt;sons.  Being born in England myself there was never any thought of chopping<br/>\n&gt;off parts of my son.  I married an American who thought that was going to<br/>\n&gt;happen until I presented him with all the research from both countries,<br/>\n&gt;together with all the photos and he quickly changed his mind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I asked my husband &quot;why would you want them to be circumcised?&quot; he said &quot;so<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;d look like me&quot;.  My next question was &quot;so how often and how much do <br/>\n&gt;men<br/>\n&gt;look at each other&#39;s penis&#39; and compare them?&quot;  He laughed and said &quot;not at<br/>\n&gt;all&quot;...&quot;in fact we do everything to avoid eye contact and we certainly <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;chat like women do when they are in the bathroom (I&#39;d let him in on this<br/>\n&gt;secret)&quot;... So next question &quot;if the research proves that it&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt;necessary<br/>\n&gt;and men don&#39;t look at each other, why do a painful procedure that will <br/>\n&gt;change<br/>\n&gt;their sexual experience forever?&quot;..... My logic won out, thank <br/>\n&gt;goodness.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When my boys (nearly 6 and nearly 2) recognize they are &quot;different&quot; from<br/>\n&gt;daddy (the older one already has) we explained to him that we choose not to<br/>\n&gt;mutilate him by circumcising him.

I just <br/>\nwent with the flow.  What a horrible experience it was for all of <br/>\nus.  I missed the baby when they took him from me, so I decided to <br/>\npay him a visit during the procedure, you know, make sure he was o.k. <br/>\nand all.  To my surprise, the dr. was standing at his feet with these <br/>\ntwo teenage girls on either side of the isolete.  I couldn&#39;t figure <br/>\nout what was going on.  Then I noticed a photographer in there taking <br/>\npictures!!!!!  When a nurse walked out I asked her what was going <br/>\non.  She seemed al little apprehensive and told me that the local <br/>\nnewspaper was doing a piece on the local highschool doing stuff <br/>\nregarding &quot;career day&quot; or something like that.  She knew they had not <br/>\ngot my permission and was concerned  about it, but someone else told <br/>\nher they would get my signature afterwords!!  Needless to say, I was <br/>\nPISSED!  I confronted the photographer and he said he took shots that <br/>\nwere focused on the students not the baby and that he wouldn&#39;t use <br/>\nthe pictures unless I signed.  I should have demanded the film right <br/>\nthen and there, if thinking straight and feeling stronger, I would <br/>\nhave.  These students didn&#39;t even have masks on!!  This is the same <br/>\nhospital who questioned my husband bringing in our other four kids to <br/>\nvisit! I was ready to take legal action I was sooo upset.  After <br/>\nspeaking to my dad who told me it was wrong of them to do that, but <br/>\nto calm down because it wasn&#39;t good for me and just focus on the fact <br/>\nthat I had a beautiful healthy baby and let it go, and I did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did call the head of the hospital and they came down right away and <br/>\nwere SO SWEET to me.  You know they were quite concerned about a law <br/>\nsuit!  They even sent me a bouquet of flowers when I got home.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Saga","from":"&quot;Saga&quot; &lt;mom@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"IgCNN8ILjiPzvHnra3NTLVEFyNVpnyzdU5VXBDBlpSaCwGjjW8p-HVKf0pIdtnJnlCM3UHS5xMfVnWpK5pil3EZSFg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Vaccinations/Circumcision","postDate":"997504270","msgId":23122,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5GQkJLR0dKQUxPTEFDREhITEhET0VCQ0NGQUEubW9tQHBhZ2FucGFyZW50LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZDMwMWMxMjFiZiQ4YWYyNzQ2MCQ0MzVkZDFkMUBqaWRhMzU+"},"prevInTopic":23107,"nextInTopic":23134,"prevInTime":23121,"nextInTime":23123,"topicId":23093,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I thought it was about 80% or something in the 70s that circumcised.
