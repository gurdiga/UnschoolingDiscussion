If any of you have dealt with a child like or similar to <br/>\nDevon, we&#39;d be most interested in hearing from you.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell my dd is 4 1/2. It has only been in the last 5 months that she has<br/>\nstopped being obnoxious to other children in similar ways that you describe.<br/>\nShe also still hits us (Daddy and I) sometimes when she is especially<br/>\nfrustrated, although I am pleased to say that she has pretty much stopped<br/>\nbiting when furious. My point is that these behaviors are not necessarily<br/>\nexclusively tied to the various learning and physiological issues you have<br/>\ndescribed in his history, but are partly to do with emotional maturity.<br/>\nMy experience, limited as it is, is that little folk *don&#39;t* always, or even<br/>\noften, respond to verbal corrections especially if they are in a meltdown.<br/>\nWhat I would do with Jayn, when she did some unpleasant and apparently<br/>\nunprovoked action towards another child, was/is:<br/>\nFirst wait and see if the other child was going to protest to Jayn, take<br/>\naction on her own behalf like walk away, or if they would work it out<br/>\nbetween them (not if the other was much younger/smaller - but then I would<br/>\nbe nearer to prevent anything in that situation.) <br/>\nThen if either the other child looked like they were about to get upset, or<br/>\nit looked like it might escalate, I would step in. (I should give the caveat<br/>\nthat I step in at once if I see that Jayn is watching me as she does this<br/>\nstuff (like toss sand) because it is clear that her agenda is about me, not<br/>\nthe other kid in that instance.)<br/>\nI usually get down on the ground, hug Jayn in one arm, and apologize to the<br/>\nother child on Jayn&#39;s behalf, and ask if they are hurt. I then remove Jayn.<br/>\nIn private with her, I would point out how the other child seemed upset, and<br/>\nask her what led up to it, if she was angry, and what she was trying to<br/>\nachieve - although usually I can only get a history somewhat later on.<br/>\nI came to the realization that Jayn sometimes acted out unpleasantly because<br/>\nshe was ready to leave, but hadn&#39;t learnt how to say so, or really<br/>\nunderstood inside herself that she was ready to go. This has changed with<br/>\nmaturity, and her willingness to play both in groups and with a single other<br/>\nchild, and not always try to take over the game, has increased tremendously.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it will help you to think of your son simply as &quot;younger&quot; than his<br/>\nchronological age and engage with him accordingly, rather than &quot;delayed&quot; or<br/>\nany of the other labels. By the same token &quot;implementing play therapy&quot; seems<br/>\nto be the kind of clinical language that might actually get in the way and<br/>\nmake it clear to Devon that you have an agenda that is about your goals for<br/>\nhis behavior. How about just &quot;playing with him&quot; as the language you use?<br/>\nMy own current struggle with Jayn is dealing with those baffling moments of<br/>\ndeliberate rebellion, when she looks me right in the eye, laughs and pours<br/>\nthe water into the carpet. I am so glad that I made a deliberate conscious<br/>\ndecision never to spank or punish because there are times when I am tempted<br/>\n- entirely out of my own frustration. I think it has gotten harder because<br/>\nJayn has now reached the same age I was when I have memories of constant<br/>\nspankings, impotent fury and fear of my mother. I know somehow or other that<br/>\nthese moments come because I have not seen her need soon enough, or not<br/>\ngiven her the attention she needed for long enough.<br/>\nRobyn L.

We have a four year old <br/>\nson who joined our family two years ago and was a little wild cat. He has <br/>\nsevere ADHD/ODD and is being referred to the FAS clinic at the Marcus <br/>\nInstitute <br/>\nfor further evaluation. He was tested by the neuropsychology department at <br/>\nScottish Rite Children&#39;s Hospital last year and is functioning at the <br/>\nborderline <br/>\nlevel of intelligence in some areas and moderately intellectually delayed in <br/>\nothers. He also has dysmorphic features, fine motor skill delays and seizure <br/>\ndisorder.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are searching for ways to help him learn to manage himself. He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike large groups, another reason for making the decision to unschool him. He <br/>\ncurrently attends special education pre-k for half day. I only recently <br/>\nbecame a <br/>\nstay-at-home parent so he&#39;s now able to come home much earlier than he has <br/>\nfor <br/>\nthe past two years. He&#39;ll need to continue to receive some services through <br/>\nthe public school system (speech, OT) so there will still be times when he <br/>\ncan&#39;t be totally/only at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur biggest dilemma is dealing with behavior issues.
