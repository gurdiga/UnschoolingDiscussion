Mary wasn&#39;t as <br/>\nupset that he stayed behind as she was that he hadn&#39;t communicated <br/>\nhis decision.  She was terrified that she had lost her child, the Son <br/>\nof G-d that had been put into her charge by G-d.  Seems a pretty <br/>\nreasonable reaction to say, &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;  Then, the <br/>\nstory continues that Jesuse returned to Nazareth with his parents and <br/>\nwas obedient to them.  What this means to me is that, even though <br/>\nJesus was the Son of G-d, he was still a human child that needed <br/>\nguidance and structure to ensure he would fulfill His purpose.  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure how this fits into society&#39;s propaganda about schooling.  <br/>\nAlthough, if Mary had been more sensitive, she would&#39;ve realized that <br/>\nJesus was where he really belonged.  He actually belonged in &quot;school&quot; <br/>\n(the temple is where lessons were taught) and his parents were the <br/>\nones pulling him out.  Maybe, it would&#39;ve been better for them to <br/>\nmove to Jerusalem so that Jesus could continue his studies with the <br/>\ngreat teachers who were quickly becoming his peers.  Also, it is my <br/>\nunderstanding that Mary was well-informed in Jewish law and tradition <br/>\nand was an important part of Jesus&#39; knowledge of Judaism.  It seems <br/>\nthat the perfect solution would&#39;ve been to combine those two <br/>\nresources so that Jesus would&#39;ve gotten the best of both worlds.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 3/31/01 10:43:10 AM, ecsamhill@e... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; My belief is that many men are &quot;stoic&quot; about their school <br/>\nexperiences. <br/>\n&gt; They won&#39;t admit how much those experiences hurt.

I&#39;m still working my way through them all and I&#39;m really <br/>\nenjoying them.  As I read all your thoughts, I&#39;m getting more <br/>\ncomfortable with the idea of defining with my son what &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\nmeans to us.  He&#39;s a very wise 6-year-old and I&#39;ve always been able <br/>\nto include him in the process of decision-making.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to answer specifically a few of your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked, &quot;Is Unschooling what Ryland was asking you for in the <br/>\nfirst place?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRyland has wanted to be homeschooled since he could talk.  I was <br/>\nalways resistant, wasn&#39;t something I thought I wanted to do or would <br/>\nbe good at.  Since we&#39;ve been home in this modified program, I&#39;ve <br/>\ndiscovered just how good I am at it and how much more I want of it.  <br/>\nRyland has said he wants to be home all the time and I believe him.  <br/>\nAs far as &quot;unschooling&quot;, I&#39;m not sure either of us has defined it <br/>\nwell enough to say we want it.  Although, like I said in my original <br/>\nletter, I have parented Ryland in a way that makes unschooling seem <br/>\nto be a natural progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked, &quot;Does he think he&#39;ll be doing nothing all day long?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, since Ryland was in public school for 1 1/2 years and <br/>\nis still now in workshops two days a week, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ready <br/>\nfor absolutely no structure.  I would have to wean him from it.  But, <br/>\nto some degree, I&#39;m realizing that Ryland likes structure.  He is a <br/>\nrule-follower just like mom!  So, as I begin to define unschooling in <br/>\nour lives, I believe that it will include structure, but structure <br/>\nthat Ry and I define, not others.  Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked, &quot;Does your husband feel a standard curriculum guarantees <br/>\nresults?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, yes, yes! At the same time we were making the decision to take <br/>\nRy out of public school, my husband made the decision to return to <br/>\nschool to get his teaching credential.  He currently owns a record <br/>\nstore (24+ years) and is looking for a change.  What perfection that <br/>\nwe are moving out of the school system and into it simultaneously.  <br/>\nWe actually know a couple male ps teachers whose wives homeshcool <br/>\ntheir children.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked, &quot;Did you feel satisfied with your school experience when <br/>\nyou were growing up?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time, yes.  Looking back, no.  What school did provide for me <br/>\nwas the stability and predictability that I desprately needed as a <br/>\nchild.  There was a lot of chaos in my home and I can&#39;t imagine not <br/>\nhaving school to go to.  But, where I believe the school did fail me <br/>\nwas especially in their approach to math.  At that time, they didn&#39;t <br/>\nteach concepts, they taught &quot;how&quot; to do math.  It wasn&#39;t until <br/>\nadulthood when I began using math in my own work that I discovered <br/>\nthat I&#39;m reeeeeally good at math.  I wish I&#39;d known it sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your thoughtful response.

That&#39;s not exactly the same as a longitudinal study showing that<br/>\nkids who go to preschool turn out to be happier, wealthier or more demure. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  Logic like my brothers can also be used to support ritual mutilation<br/>\nand scarification.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Apologies to those of you who are eating breakfast while reading your<br/>\nmail.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s book, _The Schools Our Children Deserve_ has some good<br/>\ninsights (based on research, with footnotes) about why hands-on,<br/>\ninterest-driven learning is best for children.

I checked this book out of the library one morning and <br/>\nfinished it that night. It was excellent! It totally changed my outlook on <br/>\nthe learning process.<br/>\nI just started &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; also. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck! My husband is very supportive of the idea----but the rest of the <br/>\nfamily still thinks I&#39;m crazy so I know somewhat how you feel! :)Merri</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A.

As far as family or friends go, I tend to tell them the things that<br/>\nsound &quot;educational&quot;, and just not mention the rest.  OTH, as I go farther<br/>\ndown the path I am feeling more comfortable telling my mom (the only one<br/>\nwho really asks - and she LOVES my dds sooo much), some of my ideas about<br/>\nwhy I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing.

I don&#39;t really like<br/>\nall of his ideas, BUT DO like the delayed academics part.)  So, you can<br/>\ntell family about the advantages of delaying formal academics until 10 or<br/>\n12.

The \nchild that has the hardest time is the one that spent many years in public \nschool.She is&nbsp;very dependent on someone telling her what to do \nacademically.

She does have a Christian worldview. <u>Dumbing Us \nDown </u>by John Taylor Gatto&nbsp; a former teacher of the year who shows what \nlessons the public schools really teach. <u>Homeschooling for Excellence </u>by \nDavid and Micki Colfax. They unschooled four sons who eventually received \nscholarships to Ivy League schools. <u>The Successful Homeschool Family Handbook \n</u>by Raymond and Dorothy Moore, pioneers in the homeschooling movement. maybe \nif your husband reads some of these, he will see things differently.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;This group is an excellent source of support because we all share the \nvision of child directed learning.

We just <br/>\nrecently (December) pulled our 6-year-old son, Ryland, out of public <br/>\nschool and placed him in a charter school program that combines <br/>\ntraditional class time, called workshops, and homeschooling.  <br/>\nWorkshops are Mon. and Wed. I homeschool the other three days.  The <br/>\ncharter school provides everything including the schedule of <br/>\nlearning, which is very academic!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first, I thought this was all great.  We were so glad to get Ry <br/>\nout of the program he was in and his learning really took off with me <br/>\nhaving more input in his day.  But, as I&#39;m sure you already know, it <br/>\nis still a struggle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRyland has always wanted to be homeschooled and I have resisted.  <br/>\nDidn&#39;t think I could do it, wasn&#39;t sure I believed in it, etc.  <br/>\nYou&#39;ve heard it all.  But, from the first day Ry was home, I was <br/>\nhooked!  But, the struggle was stil there.  It wasn&#39;t until just two <br/>\nweeks ago I stumbled across Home Ed Magazine and the whole concept of <br/>\nunschooling.  I was stunned!  For six years now I have prided myself <br/>\nfor parenting Ryland using what I call &quot;intuitive parenting&quot;, which <br/>\nreally means child directed.  I have breastfed on demand and let him <br/>\ndecide when he was ready to stop.  I didn&#39;t potty-train Ryland, I <br/>\njust gently guided him until he decided he was ready.  I didn&#39;t teach <br/>\nRyland how to tie his shoes until he asked and then he learned in one <br/>\nday.  The list goes on and on.  So, you can understand how my heart <br/>\nbegan to ache as I realized that I wasn&#39;t homeschooling in the same <br/>\nway I was parenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked to my husband about how I feel and mentioned the <br/>\nconcept of unschooling.  That went over like a lead balloon!  :-)  <br/>\nBut, a year ago he wouldn&#39;t have imagined that we would be <br/>\nhomeschooling and he loves it now!  He says he&#39;ll fight me every step <br/>\nof the way when I say I want to homeschool on our own, not using a <br/>\ncurriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where do I go from here?  I need information.  I need anecdotal <br/>\n(sp?) evidence.  I need direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave others felt strongly about unschooling and felt resistance from <br/>\ntheir husbands?  What does a typical (if there is such a thing)<br/>\nunschooling day look like for all of you?  How do you let go of the <br/>\nstrong messages from friends, family, society that traditional <br/>\nschooling is the only way to produce a functioning human being?  Are <br/>\nthere any statistics on unschooling?  My husband loves proof that it <br/>\nwill all turn out o.k.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never struggled this much with anything else since having <br/>\nRyland.  This is much harder to follow my heart than staying home <br/>\nfulltime.  I thought there was very little support out there in the <br/>\nworld for stay-at-home-moms.  But, it seems like nothing compared to <br/>\nthe lack of support and understanding I sense there is for <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve made it to the end of this letter, I&#39;d love to hear your <br/>\nthoughts.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nAllison</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Judie C.
