We too are always in construction/destruction with our big<br/>\nold house and our kids love it. The love the noise, the mess, the people<br/>\ncoming and going, the machines, the physical changes. We try to let them<br/>\nsee/watch/touch as much as possible. Last week when we were cleaning out our<br/>\ngarage - which is full of my husbands dumpster diving treasures, they had a<br/>\nblast building little habitats out of wood, flowers, tape, clothes drying<br/>\nrack etc. It really amazes me. They need NO toys - just access to all the<br/>\ncool stuff in the world.... They are 2 and 4 and love to play with tools,<br/>\ndirt, water, plants, and any weird piece of anything they find... wonderful!<br/>\n&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/12/06, Karri Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:karri_a_lewis@...\">karri_a_lewis@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  As in my previous post that I mentioned, we are remodeling.
