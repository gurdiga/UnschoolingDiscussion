He is very mature for his age (and tall) so everyone thinks <br/>\nhe&#39;s much older than he is.  I think I just need to hear from someone, <br/>\nanyone, that I&#39;m doing the right thing not putting him in the hs teen <br/>\nnight, etc. in the area.  He does do activities with ps kids.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that I was getting at was that peers does not have to mean &quot;age<br/>\npeers&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I wrote &quot;people&quot; I was trying to get at the notion that there are<br/>\ninterest based societies or groups or places that are open to a range of<br/>\nages including adults. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am more convinced that hanging out with a bunch of controlled and<br/>\nrestricted teens - the surest way to extend adolescent attitudes - will not<br/>\nbe very helpful to him or you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he *want* to go to teen night? I&#39;m concerned about the phrase &quot;putting<br/>\nhim in&quot; the teen night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a little confused about why Community College courses would be a problem<br/>\nfor getting scholarships. It sounds illogical. What does Wes Beach have to<br/>\nsay on this? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that is future focused thinking. If your son is interested in some<br/>\nComm. College courses now, he should be able to take them. He may not want<br/>\nto go to a degree program if the CC fulfils his needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
