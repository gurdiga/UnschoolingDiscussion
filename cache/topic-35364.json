The renowned Italian journalist and interviewer Oriana<br/>\nFallaci wrote Arab culture off as a few interesting architectural flourishes<br/>\nand the Quran. Apparently, it&#39;s easy to forget that history is cyclical and<br/>\nthe roles were once reversed. A millennium ago, while the West was shrouded<br/>\nin darkness, Islam enjoyed a golden age. Lighting in the streets of Cordoba<br/>\nwhen London was a barbarous pit; religious tolerance in Toledo while<br/>\npogroms raged from York to Vienna. As custodians of our classical legacy,<br/>\nArabs were midwives to our Renaissance. Their influence, however alien it<br/>\nmight seem, has always been with us, whether it&#39;s a cup of steaming hot Joe<br/>\nor the algorithms in computer programs. A little magnanimity is called for.<br/>\n<br/>\nA is for algebra<br/>\nFrom &quot;al-jabr,&quot; Arabic for &quot;restoration,&quot; itself a transliteration of a<br/>\nLatin term, and just one of many contributions Arab mathematicians have made<br/>\nto the &quot;Queen of Sciences.&quot; Al-Khwarizmi (c.780-c.850), the chief librarian<br/>\nof the observatory, research center and library called the House of Wisdom<br/>\nin Baghdad, was the man responsible for making my life miserable at school.<br/>\nThe motivation behind his treatise, &quot;Hisab al-jabr w&#39;al-muqabala&quot;<br/>\n(&quot;Calculation by Restoration and Reduction&quot;: widely used up to the 17th<br/>\ncentury), which covers linear and quadratic equations, was to solve trade<br/>\nimbalances, inheritance questions and problems arising from land surveyance<br/>\nand allocation. In passing, he also introduced into common usage our present<br/>\nnumerical system, which replaced the old, cumbersome Roman one. Al-Karaji of<br/>\nBaghdad (953-c.1029), founder of a highly influential school of algebraic<br/>\nthought, defined higher powers and their reciprocals in his &quot;al-Fakhri&quot; and<br/>\nshowed how to find their products. He also looked at polynomials and gave<br/>\nthe rule for expanding a binomial, anticipating Pascal&#39;s triangle by more<br/>\nthan six centuries. Arab syntheses of Babylonian, Indian and Greek concepts<br/>\nalso led to important developments in arithmetic, trigonometry (the<br/>\nalgorithm, for instance, thanks to al-Khwarizmi) and spherical geometry.<br/>\n<br/>\nB is for backgammon<br/>\nSheshbesh is what it&#39;s called in Beirut and Cairo, whence the savviest<br/>\nplayers hail. Although this beautiful waste of time dates back to the<br/>\npharaohs, the form we enjoy today came to us via Moorish Spain in the 10th<br/>\ncentury. Ghioul and moultezim are two other variants of &quot;the game of<br/>\nkings,&quot; popular wherever the happy hookah is indulged.<br/>\n<br/>\nC is for cough medicine<br/>\nNecessity being the mother of invention, the Arabs were the first to distill<br/>\nwater, for long journeys across areas (such as the Sahara) where supplies<br/>\nwere uncertain. Their experiments with various chemical compounds also gave<br/>\nus ethanol alcohol, sulfuric acid, ammonia (have you ever noticed the<br/>\nuncanny resemblance between Mr. Clean and the genie in &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot;?)<br/>\nand mercury. In applied chemistry they discovered better and more efficient<br/>\nways for tanning leather and forging metals. Messing around with mortars and<br/>\npestles produced camphor, pomades and syrups.<br/>\n<br/>\nD is for Dante<br/>\nHer countryman Silvio Berlusconi echoed Fallaci&#39;s ill-spoken sentiments<br/>\nthat, on the whole, Western civilization was superior to that of Islam. She<br/>\nsaid she was quite happy with Dante, thank you very much. She spoke too<br/>\nsoon. Though the theory has long incited fierce debate, Dante may have been<br/>\nacquainted with &quot;ascension literature,&quot; a fantastical literary genre that<br/>\ndeals with Mohammed&#39;s ascent to Heaven (using a spiraling, magical ladder;<br/>\nascension literature is still popular in the Middle East and Africa). Dante<br/>\nwas undoubtedly acquainted with Avicenna and Averroes (&quot;who made the great<br/>\ncommentary&quot;), assigned as they are to that benign circle of the Inferno<br/>\nreserved for pagan and non-Christian worthies known as Limbo.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, according to the dean of Arabic literary studies, the formidable<br/>\nRobert Irwin, &quot;a full understanding of the writings of Voltaire, Dickens,<br/>\nMelville, Proust and Borges, or indeed of the origins of science fiction,<br/>\nis impossible without some familiarity with the stories of the Arabian<br/>\nNights.&quot;  Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor, Ali Baba and Scheherazade, archetypes<br/>\neach and every one, are honorary members of the Western canon. The mock,<br/>\nallegorical travelogues and cautionary tales of  Montesquieu, Voltaire,<br/>\nJohnson and other18th-century writers and philosophes, are inconceivable<br/>\nwithout the garrulous, wayward conceits of &quot;The Arabian Nights.&quot; They&#39;re<br/>\ndetectable as well in the parodic chivalry of Don Quixote and in Calvino&#39;s<br/>\npostmodern children&#39;s fable &quot;Marcovaldo.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nE is for equestrian<br/>\nAlthough the ancestors of Mr. Ed and Secretariat probably originated in<br/>\nCentral Asia (with the &quot;Heavenly Horses&quot; of the King of Ferghana), our<br/>\nequine friends were first bred for speed in the desert sands of the Empty<br/>\nQuarter. Arab historian al-Kelbi (c. 786) traced the Arabian to the<br/>\npedigreed horses of Bax, great-great-great grandson of Noah. The conquest of<br/>\nthe Arabian Peninsula, North Africa and Spain was due in no small part to<br/>\nthe aptly named beast (and the indefatigable camel), mount of choice for<br/>\nthe tribesmen who swept all in their path. The descendents of these terrible<br/>\nswift steeds were brought to the New World by the Conquistadors, to<br/>\ndevastating effect,  particularly in ancient Peru where the Incas mistook<br/>\nthe horsemen for gods. (By the time they learned the truth it was too late.)<br/>\nAppropriately enough, the largest and most successful stable today belongs<br/>\nto Sheikh Maktoum of Dubai.<br/>\n<br/>\nF is for Fitzgerald<br/>\nEdward, translator of that beloved chestnut of yore, &quot;The Rubáiyát of Omar<br/>\nKhayyám&quot; (a jug of wine, a loaf of bread -- and thou). My concern here, of<br/>\ncourse, is not with Fitzgerald, nice duffer though he was, but with Khayyám<br/>\nhimself (1048-1131) -- gifted physician, Persian bard and geometer<br/>\nextraordinaire. In his seminal &quot;Algebra&quot; he attempted a fusion of algebraic<br/>\nand geometric methods, discussing the solution of cubic equations by<br/>\ngeometric means, anticipating analytical geometry. (Descartes took up this<br/>\nthread 500 years later, though it&#39;s unlikely he knew Khayyám&#39;s work.)<br/>\nKhayyám also dabbled in astronomy, his lunar calculations leading him to<br/>\nreform the calendar in 1079 (there are references to this throughout the<br/>\nRubáiyát). Furthermore, Islamic astronomers invented the pendulum, improved<br/>\nupon the sundial, prognosticated the existence of sunspots and studied<br/>\neclipses and comets. And al-Biruni calculated the length of the solar year<br/>\nto within 24 seconds and discussed the earth&#39;s rotation on its axis -- 500<br/>\nyears before Galileo. Arabian and Islamic astronomers also constructed the<br/>\nfirst observatories, in Toledo, Cordoba, Baghdad and Cairo.<br/>\n<br/>\nG is for guitar<br/>\nIf the Moors had known they would be responsible for the spectacle of Mick<br/>\nJagger shaking his scrawny ass onstage into his late 50s, they might have<br/>\nthought twice about schlepping the early prototypes of the instruments that<br/>\nmake up the typical rock band to Spain and Southern Italy. Percussion in the<br/>\nform of cymbals and timpani, bowed instruments, the lute (from &quot;al-ud,&quot; the<br/>\nwood; see &quot;The Buena Vista Social Club&quot; for more), the Spanish guitar (or<br/>\nguitarra morisca as it was originally called 800 years ago), the zither<br/>\n(brought west from Greece), the dulcimer began keeping the neighbors awake<br/>\nas early as the 9th century. There&#39;s also that unique Near Eastern sound and<br/>\nrhythm, which, aside from early Spanish music, made itself felt in<br/>\n18th-century classical music, most famously in Mozart&#39;s &quot;The Abduction from<br/>\nthe Seraglio.&quot; (Turkish things were so &quot;in&quot; then. Witness all those<br/>\nwonderfully exotic 18th-century Venetian scenes by Longhi and Reynolds&#39;<br/>\ncostumed, turbaned toffs.) Miles Davis accented the &quot;Oriental,&quot; Near Eastern<br/>\nstrain in his &quot;Sketches of Spain.&quot; The godfather of world music, Davis<br/>\nincorporated Middle Eastern elements into his fusion of jazz and rock in the<br/>\nlate &#39;60s and &#39;70s. Nowadays nobody thinks twice about such hybridization.<br/>\n<br/>\nH is for &quot;Havi&quot;<br/>\nExpanding on the legacy of the Greek physician and philosopher Galen was<br/>\nRhazes (c. 865-c. 930), the greatest doctor of the Middle Ages. His<br/>\nextensive medical treatise in nine volumes, &quot;Havi&quot; (&quot;The Virtuous Life&quot;),<br/>\nwas used as a textbook in the Sorbonne as late as 1395. In addition to case<br/>\nstudies and clinical reports that still have anecdotal interest, Rhazes<br/>\nalso wrote a celebrated monograph on smallpox. (Knock wood.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Book of Healing,&quot; by the Persian physician and philosopher Avicenna<br/>\n(980-1037), is a masterwork on hygiene and therapeutics that was used as a<br/>\nreference well into the 16th century. With Averroes (1126-1198), the<br/>\nAndalusian physician and philosopher, Arabian medicine attained its peak.<br/>\nMuslim surgeons in the 11th century knew how to treat cataracts and internal<br/>\nhemorrhaging, and they pioneered the usage of anesthetics, which they<br/>\nderived from herbs. Arabian hospitals anticipated our modern ones in<br/>\ncombining teaching facilities and libraries, and in offering<br/>\nspecializations such as internal medicine, opthamology, orthopedics and<br/>\npharmacology (on the last, Ibn al-Bayter, who died in 1248, described 1,400<br/>\ndifferent medicines of vegetable and mineral origin alone). They also set<br/>\nstandards for cleanliness and hygiene that in the West shamefully weren&#39;t<br/>\nmet till the 19th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nI is for Ibn Khaldun of Tunis (1332-1406)<br/>\nHe invented the scientific study of history (and, indirectly it could be<br/>\nargued, sociology) centuries before the French Enlightenment, Hegel, Weber<br/>\nand Braudel. His &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; (&quot;The Prolegomena&quot;), the introduction to a<br/>\ngeneral survey of Islamic history with a specific focus on North Africa, was<br/>\nbegun in 1377 and updated several times to account for sociopolitical<br/>\nchanges. In it, he attempts to order the raw material and outward phenomena<br/>\nof history under basic principles.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Wise and ignorant are at one in appreciating history, since in its external<br/>\naspect it is no more than narratives telling us how circumstances<br/>\nrevolutionize the affairs of men, but in its internal aspect it involves an<br/>\naccurate perception of the causes and origins of phenomena. For this reason<br/>\nit is based on and deeply rooted in philosophy, worthy to be reckoned among<br/>\nits branches.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Human society in its various manifestations shows certain inherent features<br/>\nby which all narratives must be controlled ... The historian who relies<br/>\nsolely upon tradition and who has no thorough understanding of the<br/>\nprinciples governing the normal course of events, the fundamental rules of<br/>\nthe art of government, the nature of civilization and the characteristics of<br/>\nhuman society is seldom secure against straying from the highway of truth<br/>\n... All traditional narratives must invariably be referred back to general<br/>\nprinciples and controlled by reference to fundamental rules.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf Olympian detachment, Ibn Khaldun was less prone than most historians,<br/>\nthen and now, to fiddle the books and force facts to fit preconceived<br/>\ntheories. He saw that the course of history is governed by the balance of<br/>\ntwo forces, which for him were the nomadic and the settled life. He<br/>\nidentified history with civilization and, having established this theory,<br/>\nexpounded in minute detail upon civilization in all its religious,<br/>\nadministrative, economic, artistic and scientific layers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIbn Khaldun briefly made headlines in the early 1980s, when President Reagan<br/>\nquoted him in a speech. His name mystified the White House press corps,<br/>\ndriving them to their encyclopedias to bone up on this Ibn guy; within hours<br/>\nthey were speaking knowledgeably of him. As an undergraduate at the time, I<br/>\nwas taking a yearlong seminar entitled &quot;Oriental Humanities.&quot; One of our<br/>\nassigned texts in the Arabian section was &quot;Muqqadimah.&quot; Professor Meskill,<br/>\nan old China hand, informed us of the Great Communicator&#39;s &quot;erudition.&quot; We<br/>\nall had a good laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ is for jihad<br/>\nThis word, which has been misinterpreted as &quot;religious war&quot; but really means<br/>\n&quot;an effort&quot; or &quot;striving,&quot; is one of many Arabic words that have entered the<br/>\nEnglish language. Besides mullah and ayatollah, which have also acquired<br/>\npejorative connotations, a partial list of Arabic words or derivatives<br/>\nthereof includes: alcohol, orange, coffee, sofa, caravan, tariff (from<br/>\nTarifa -- the village through which the Moors invaded Spain, near<br/>\nGibraltar), citrus, lemon, alembic, algebra, chess, sugar, cataract,<br/>\nmagazine, seraphim, arsenal (also the name of a London soccer club, Osama<br/>\nbin Laden&#39;s favorite, appropriately enough), apricot, sandal, Satan (from<br/>\n&quot;Shaitan,&quot; the Evil One), rice (from &quot;al-ruzz&quot;), sherbet and sorbet,<br/>\ntalisman, artichoke, rack (from &quot;arrack,&quot; perspiration, also the name of<br/>\nthe fiery spirit, raqi; wrack your brains on that one), almanac, alcove,<br/>\nalbatross (from &quot;al-kadas,&quot; which the Portuguese corrupted into &quot;alcatraz&quot;;<br/>\nnow what would the author of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; make of that?), castle (from<br/>\n&quot;alcazar&quot;), albacore, Abyssinia, ginger, ghoul, zircon (from which we derive<br/>\n&quot;jargon,&quot; one being a mixture of stones, the other of tongues), banana (from<br/>\n&quot;banan,&quot; finger or toes), nadir, zenith, cipher, zero and monsoon (from<br/>\n&quot;mausim,&quot; or season).<br/>\n<br/>\nK is for kebab<br/>\nNext time you&#39;re munching on a Nathans, or, in my case, disputing the<br/>\nnutritional value of chorizo with the missus, you have the Moor to thank.<br/>\nCured meats and sausages and the humble kebab, usually lamb or beef (never<br/>\npork), were among the culinary delights that came to Europe via Islamic<br/>\nSpain. Likewise the hotter spices and spicier condiments. The Moors were<br/>\nalso the first to crystallize sugar (which they also brought to Europe).<br/>\n<br/>\nL is for latte<br/>\nAs you sip one of those wimpy, froufrou confections in Starbucks, think<br/>\nabout this: Arabica. Yes, the humble coffee bean. First cultivated and<br/>\nbrewed as rocket fuel by Yemeni tribesman way back when -- though it&#39;s<br/>\ndisputed whether the beans were transplanted from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to<br/>\nthe Arabian Peninsula or whether it was the other way around. As an<br/>\nafterthought, we might not now have this plague of Starbucks and chi-chi<br/>\ncafes were it not for the Ottoman Turks, the Viennese getting the clever<br/>\nidea of the coffeehouse from them in the late 17th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nM is for mosque<br/>\nFunny, thinking about what Oriana Fallaci said earlier, the architectural<br/>\nflourish commonly attributed to the Moors, the curved arch, was actually<br/>\ncopied from the Visigoths in Spain. Byzantine art and architecture, above<br/>\nall the Hagia Sophia in what was then Constantinople, had a profound<br/>\ninfluence on Islamic builders and artisans. However, it&#39;s the humble church<br/>\nsteeple (via the mighty cathedral tower) that has an Islamic antecedent,<br/>\nthe minaret.<br/>\n<br/>\nN is for navigation<br/>\nWithout Arabian improvements upon the compass, the astrolabe, nautical maps<br/>\nand seaworthy lanterns, Magellan, Cabot, Vasco da Gama, Columbus, et al.,<br/>\nmight have had trouble pulling anchor and leaving port. The Arabs also<br/>\npioneered the usage of hydraulic presses and water clocks, which tracked<br/>\nthe passage of time and phases of the moon.<br/>\n<br/>\nO is for optics<br/>\nThe concept of camera obscura, which is indispensable to the later<br/>\ndevelopment of photography, was first suggested in &quot;The Treatise on<br/>\nOptics,&quot; by Hassan Ali Aitan (963-1009).<br/>\n<br/>\nP is for paradise<br/>\nConsider the varieties of roses -- the damask and the gallica, to name the<br/>\ntwo most common -- brought to Europe through Spain and Southern Italy by the<br/>\nMoor. Perhaps a rose is a rose is a rose, but what signifies here is where<br/>\nthey&#39;re planted, and to Islamic sages and poets, gardens were symbolic of<br/>\nthe paradise to come, a &quot;blue green&quot; paradise, blue for water, naturally,<br/>\nand green for greenery. The word &quot;paradise&quot; is of Persian origin<br/>\n(&quot;paradaeza&quot;); it literally means garden. Paradise as a garden or pleasure<br/>\nground with swaying houris (heavenly handmaidens), the one that&#39;s promised<br/>\nto good male Muslims, figures heavily in the Quran, in contrast to Genesis<br/>\nwhere the Garden of Eden is a paradise lost. (And there are no houris in the<br/>\nOld Testament and definitely none in the New; is it any wonder Islam won so<br/>\nmany converts?)<br/>\n<br/>\nQ is for Qasim<br/>\nCan you name the mystical Sufi poet who inspired Spiritual Girl Madonna to<br/>\nwhirl like a dervish in &quot;Speed of Light&quot;? The one who is beloved by Demi<br/>\nMoore, quoted by Deepak Chopra and read by New Age ninnies from Beverly<br/>\nHills to Notting Hill? (None of this, incidentally, should be held against<br/>\nhim.) A Persian of Greek descent, who&#39;s up there in the Persian pantheon<br/>\nwith Attar, Firdausi, Hafiz, Khayyam and Sadi? OK, OK, you know already:<br/>\nIt&#39;s Jalad&#39;din , but actually before him there was another, more carnal<br/>\nRumi. Ibn al-Rumi (836-896) was an expansive, unforgettable, larger than<br/>\nlife figure, Walt Whitman and Dylan Thomas rolled into one. He was<br/>\nmagnificently ugly, unkempt and unwashed, pugnacious and ferociously<br/>\nsarcastic (&quot;Those who kiss ass shouldn&#39;t complain of wind&quot;), promiscuous,<br/>\ngluttonous, bibulous, blasphemous and irredeemably bohemian -- and he<br/>\nwondered why he couldn&#39;t get a position at court. And Qasim, you ask? He<br/>\nwas the Caliph&#39;s vizier, who, fearful of the poet&#39;s wicked tongue,<br/>\ngraciously poisoned him at supper. Rumi, though, had the last laugh. Upon<br/>\nquaffing the fatal potion and having a good burp, Rumi rose to leave. Qasim<br/>\nasked where he was off to, and Rumi replied he was going where the vizier<br/>\nhad sent him. &quot;In that case, convey my greetings to my father,&quot; Qasim said,<br/>\nthinking himself very witty. &quot;I am not going to the fires of hell,&quot; Rumi<br/>\nreplied. (Well, I needed something for Q.)<br/>\n<br/>\nR is for religious tolerance and racial equality<br/>\nYes, hard as that might be for some to believe, Islam was the first major<br/>\nreligion, certainly the first monotheistic one, to practice religious<br/>\ntolerance. Not that Muslim tribesmen didn&#39;t put to the sword those who<br/>\nrefused to convert -- they committed their fair share of well-documented<br/>\nmassacres early on -- but military success came so swiftly to them and on<br/>\nsuch a vast scale, that they found themselves burdened with an empire, and<br/>\nneeded all the help they could get from their cleverer subjects to run it.<br/>\nThey were, after all, warriors, not administrators. As rulers they were<br/>\nlenient, even generous (unlike the Germanic tribes that ravaged the late<br/>\nRoman Empire). Besides, Jews and Christians were &quot;People of the Book&quot; --<br/>\nIslam borrowed much from its elders; Abraham, Moses and Christ are<br/>\nrecognized prophets in the Koran -- and as long as they paid their tithe to<br/>\nthe Caliph and kept out of trouble, they were free to do as they wished (the<br/>\nZoroastrians in Persia were treated in similar fashion). &quot;Holy Toledo,&quot; the<br/>\nmeeting point of the three great religions, became a model of religious<br/>\ntolerance and harmony -- an idyll that ended when the Christian kings of the<br/>\nnorth recaptured it in 1085. (Until the rise of Holland in the 17th century,<br/>\nif you were Jewish it was generally better for your overall health and<br/>\nwell-being to live in Muslim lands such as North Africa, the Levant or<br/>\nTurkey than almost anywhere in Christendom, particularly those places where<br/>\nCatholicism prevailed. French missionaries are to blame for introducing the<br/>\nvirus of anti-Semitism to the Middle East in the 19th century.) Of the three<br/>\ngreat thinkers who flourished under Islamic rule, one was non-Muslim,<br/>\nMaimonides of Cordoba (1135-1204), author of &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed,&quot;<br/>\nwho was Jewish. Like Avicenna and his fellow Cordoban, Averroes, Maimonides<br/>\nattempted to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with religious belief. He<br/>\ndied in Alexandria, where he founded the great synagogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding race, Islam is colorblind, which came as a surprise to Malcolm X<br/>\non his pilgrimage to Mecca, where he found himself worshipping alongside<br/>\nblond-haired, blue-eyed white devils. Unlike Christianity, which justified<br/>\nracial slavery (blacks were inferior, less than human and so forth) by<br/>\nciting Ham in the Old Testament, Islam emphasized the equality of man before<br/>\nthe eyes of God, whether black or white, rich or poor, man or woman. But,<br/>\nas we all know, what is preached isn&#39;t necessarily what is practiced. The<br/>\ncruel irony of Malcolm X&#39;s revelation, which challenged his ideas and<br/>\nchanged the course of his life, was that he had it in a country that didn&#39;t<br/>\nabolish slavery until 1973. (Slavery exists today, despite claims to the<br/>\ncontrary, in Mauritania and in the Sudan, both Muslim nations, the latter a<br/>\nfundamentalist state that has prosecuted a genocidal war against its<br/>\nsouthern, African half for more than 20 years. None of this, of course, was<br/>\nbrought up at the United Nations conference on slavery in September.) And<br/>\nalthough the British, Dutch and Portuguese dominated the Atlantic slave<br/>\ntrade in Caryl Philips&#39; &quot;Atlantic Sound,&quot; the Arabs held a firm whip hand in<br/>\nEast Africa, built entire ports and cities devoted solely to that very<br/>\nprofitable end, and played a significant role as middlemen throughout the<br/>\ncontinent. Still, it is good to know that Islam is colorblind.<br/>\n<br/>\nS is for shatranj<br/>\nAlthough modern chess originated in Northern India in the 7th century A.D.,<br/>\nwhere it was called chaturanga, it was introduced to Spain and Sicily a<br/>\ncentury later by Moorish invaders and Saracen traders. Shatranj, which<br/>\nmeans &quot;king&#39;s game&quot; (shah tranj), differs slightly from the game we know<br/>\ntoday,  in that instead of a queen there was a firzan, and in place of the<br/>\nbishop there was a fil (of course). The game was slower, with pawns allowed<br/>\nto advance but one square in the opening and no castling allowed. Victory<br/>\ncame from checkmate (from the Persian, &quot;Shah mat,&quot; the King is lost or<br/>\nhelpless), stalemate or a &quot;bare king&quot; (the king alone, like Richard III at<br/>\nBosworth Field). Some caliphs played &quot;living chess&quot; -- human pieces, slaves<br/>\nor prisoners -- the downside for the participants being possible<br/>\ndecapitation if one was captured. As depicted by the Elizabethan playwright<br/>\nChristopher Marlowe, Tamburlaine -- in real life infamous for the Sack of<br/>\nBaghdad in which a million people died -- was fond of this pastime.<br/>\n<br/>\nT is for turban<br/>\nLet&#39;s face it, the turban, the burnoose, that wild and crazy Arafat thingy<br/>\nthe college kids love to wear, whatever you wish to call it, is a brilliant<br/>\nfashion accessory. Imagine Edith Sitwell, Audrey Hepburn or David Hume<br/>\nwithout theirs; you can&#39;t, can you? With a little bit of water moistened<br/>\nabout the inside you have a portable air conditioner. The turban was an<br/>\nearly instance of form following function, though I have a feeling Sitwell,<br/>\nHepburn and Hume were unaware of all this. Speaking of turbans, you need the<br/>\nright setting for one, too, something out of an odalisque by Ingres or<br/>\nMatisse: muslin, damask, chintz to cover sofas and pillows -- Moorish<br/>\nappurtenances on which to seat your little keester and to rest your weary<br/>\nhead -- while being fanned by eunuchs, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nU is for university<br/>\nThe concept of the university originated with the madrassas, which were<br/>\ncenters devoted to religious instruction, as they are in considerably less<br/>\ncosmopolitan forms in Muslim nations today. The first madrassas in Spain,<br/>\nin Malaga, Zaragoza and Cordoba, which later evolved into universities,<br/>\nstarted in the 11th century. The foundation of Damascus University dates<br/>\nback to the 8th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nV is for venetian glass<br/>\nVenetian glass blowers, famed for their miraculously intricate and delicate<br/>\ncreations, learned their secrets from the Arabs (and went on to monopolize<br/>\nthe glass trade for centuries). Islamic artisans and craftsmen, renowned for<br/>\ntheir ceramics, armory and masonry, made a deep impression on their<br/>\nSpanish, French and Italian counterparts. One could easily compose an<br/>\nalphabet of objects, decorative and otherwise, from Aubusson tapestries to<br/>\nthe engravings on Zildjian cymbals, that bear traces of Arabic and Islamic<br/>\ndesign and calligraphy.<br/>\n<br/>\nW is for watermelon<br/>\nThis is just one of the many crops the Arabs introduced to the West. Others<br/>\ninclude artichokes, rice, cotton, asparagus, oranges (from &quot;naranj&quot;),<br/>\nlemons, limes, figs, dates, spinach and eggplants. Arab methods of<br/>\nirrigation, which made the desert bloom, are still utilized today in North<br/>\nAfrica and the Iberian Peninsula, as are the wells and aqueducts they built.<br/>\n<br/>\nX is for Xenophon<br/>\nHave you heard of him? Friend of Socrates and Plato, guest at the Symposium,<br/>\nauthor of a treatise on horses (the Hippike), Xenophon, in truth, was a bit<br/>\nof bore. Nevertheless, we&#39;re better off for knowing him because of the<br/>\ncompany he kept. Aristotle was a special favorite of Islamic scholars and<br/>\nthinkers such as Avicenna and Averroes, particularly for his &quot;Ethics.&quot; Much<br/>\nof what remains of the Greek classics was salvaged, translated -- into<br/>\nclassical Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, Persian and vernacular languages such as<br/>\nCastillian -- and interpreted under the aegis of the Arabs, with<br/>\nnon-Muslims, anonymous scribes and great thinkers alike playing their parts<br/>\n(Maimonides comes to mind). Contrary to popular belief, it was Christian<br/>\nfanatics who sacked the Great Library of Alexandria (they followed up with a<br/>\npogrom), decades before Muhammad was born.<br/>\n<br/>\nY is for the yearning one (el taleb)<br/>\nLike Scotsmen and their kilts, there&#39;s more going on under those burqas than<br/>\nyou might think. El taleb, or &quot;the yearning one,&quot; is one of the 46 different<br/>\nkinds of vulvae described in the ninth chapter of the Arabian equivalent of<br/>\n&quot;The Kama Sutra,&quot; &quot;The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi,&quot; translated by<br/>\nmy favorite roaming Brit (a very short list, that), the randy Sir Richard<br/>\nBurton. &quot;This vagina is met with in a few women only. With some it is<br/>\nnatural; with others it becomes what it is by long abstinence. It is burning<br/>\nfor a member, and having got one in its embrace, it refuses to part with it<br/>\nuntil its fire is completely extinguished&quot;; talk about vagina monologues.<br/>\n(Note, fair ladies, there&#39;s a similar chapter on male equipment.) Other<br/>\nchapters deal with the act of generation, with praiseworthy men and women,<br/>\nwith contemptible men and women, with positions other than the missionary<br/>\n(mullah position, anyone?), with arousal techniques, with impotence and<br/>\nsterility, with pregnancy, and so on and so forth. In contrast to the early<br/>\nChristians, the Arabs had a refreshing view of sex -- it was for pleasure,<br/>\ntoo, not just procreation.<br/>\n<br/>\nZ is for zero<br/>\nFrom &quot;zefira,&quot; or cipher. Nought, nothing, nil. What a concept. Carried over<br/>\nfrom India to the West by the Arabs. Less than zero? Well, you&#39;re getting<br/>\ninto negative numbers there ...<br/>\n<br/>\n---- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Valerie Cifuentes&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homeschool@...\">homeschool@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 19, 2002 9:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hi! I&#39;m new<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi! I&#39;m Valerie<br/>\n&gt; We are new to unschooling but have been homeschooling for 7 years. One<br/>\n&gt; year I lost my head and taught at a private school for tuition so my<br/>\n&gt; children could attend. Anyway, I won&#39;t go into that.<br/>\n&gt; We live in Camp LeJeune, NC. My DH is a Navy man of 14 years.<br/>\n&gt; I have 3 kids, dd 14, dd 11, ds 9.<br/>\n&gt; I have always tried to get around NOT doing some of our workbooks and I<br/>\n&gt; never felt good about going over the same material over and over again.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I know you have heard the same thing from others. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; quite typical.<br/>\n&gt; I have been lurking for most of the day.<br/>\n&gt; I have a little opinion on the TV issue. Well, there are many rabbit<br/>\n&gt; trails on here about them. :O)<br/>\n&gt; I just wanted to introduce myself before I jumped in! :O)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about suicide bombers lately and I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to wonder what happens to make them willing to do that?  How desperate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do their lives have to be?  How much have they lost hope that things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can improve?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From what we have learned the bombers don&#39;t believe that their lives are<br/>\n&gt; desperate, bad or lacking in any way. They find that the Western culture<br/>\n&gt; with all of it&#39;s modernization and frills is very evil, as well as any<br/>\n&gt; modernization on that side of the world.<br/>\n&gt; Starvation is considered the norm and violence is a part of their<br/>\n&gt; religion.<br/>\n&gt; They kill themselves because they are taught that this life has no value<br/>\n&gt; whatsoever and paradise awaits them when they discard their earthly<br/>\n&gt; flesh. When they murder innocent people they believe that they are being<br/>\n&gt; merciful to those people by ending their corrupted lives. These bombers<br/>\n&gt; are taught from their earliest youth that the only reason they are alive<br/>\n&gt; is to die in &quot;Holy Jihad&quot; and to be with Allah very soon.<br/>\n&gt; Notice that the bombers are very young, most not even in their 30&#39;s. I<br/>\n&gt; think that their government has intensified it&#39;s teachings of Holy Jihad<br/>\n&gt; in the last couple of decades.<br/>\n&gt; The Navy is serving the Detainees and POW&#39;s in Camp X-Ray. My husband is<br/>\n&gt; attached to the fleet hospital down there. He didn&#39;t have to go as he<br/>\n&gt; was with Division at the time the hospital moved down there and he was<br/>\n&gt; &quot;left behind&quot; (though he stands a 50/50 right now of having to deploy in<br/>\n&gt; September for the change over.) The docs that come back are telling us<br/>\n&gt; how young the detainees are. The average age is 15. Their lives were so<br/>\n&gt; rugged that they can&#39;t believe the excellent treatment they are getting<br/>\n&gt; in Camp X-ray!<br/>\n&gt; They have never known what medical care really is! Needless to say,<br/>\n&gt; quite a few claim to defect. But I don&#39;t believe it. They are so<br/>\n&gt; brainwashed into the Jihad thing, it will take a lot to turn around that<br/>\n&gt; powerfully evil teaching.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, don&#39;t want to get off on a tangent. :O) But this is an<br/>\n&gt; interesting subject and my children and I have been following since<br/>\n&gt; Sept. 11 as closely as possible.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for letting me share.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n&gt; .· ´¨¨))  -:¦:-<br/>\n&gt;            ¸.·´ .·´¨¨))<br/>\n&gt;         ((¸¸.·´   .·´   -:¦:-Valerie Cifuentes<br/>\n&gt;       -:¦:-    ((¸¸.·´*<br/>\n&gt; I CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT FORWARDS, CHAIN LETTERS AND PETITIONS.
