I <br/>\n&gt; would say that he has a very addictive personality. Thing is, no one in my <br/>\n&gt; family <br/>\n&gt; is addicted to anything, as far back as great-grandparents.

They can skip generation <br/>\nafter generation only to resurface many generations later.  Some traits are <br/>\nsex-linked, some are recessive, some are mutations. There are MANY explanations for <br/>\nwhy your brother is how he is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are NO blondes or green-hazel eyes in my OR my husbad&#39;s <br/>\nfamilies---going back &quot;forever&quot;. SO why was our first born almost tow-headed? ( He&#39;s <br/>\nbrunette, now---go figure!) When the midwife said, &quot;A Blondie!&quot;. My first reaction <br/>\nwas: he must not be MINE! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get better and extremely in-depth explanations on some dog and horse <br/>\nand cattle and rat breeding lists about genetics. But things don&#39;t always <br/>\nappear as they really are: Phenotype vs genotype.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77276,"nextTopicId":77285}}
