My daughter recently went up in size, <br/>\nand was showing me everything at Wal-mart that she wanted.  I told <br/>\nher that soon it will be yard sale season and that a whole bunch of <br/>\nteenagers who think that they need to have brand new wardrobes every <br/>\nyear will get rid of last years stuff for practically nothing.  Then <br/>\nshe&#39;ll be able to get 5x the amount of stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do thrift stores too of course, but we can&#39;t wait until yard sale <br/>\nseason! <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, unolist@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/11/03 2:10:04 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; SandraDodd@a... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We got Holly $35 worth of clothes in a thrift store the other day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Seven pieces.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh my the last time I spent $35 at the thrift store, I brought home <br/>\n2 garbage <br/>\n&gt; bags full.
