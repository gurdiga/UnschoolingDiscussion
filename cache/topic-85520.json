It was my worst Xmas ever - not a single surprise.  Like Mary, my mom didn&#39;t know until years later.  But my kids decided they didn&#39;t want to risk it, so they&#39;ve never really peeked (they do shake packages that are under the tree, tho!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can at least share the stories of how some people are really disappointed when there are no surprises, then ask again if they want you to hold back at least an item or two.  If it&#39;s still &#39;no&#39; then they will have whatever natural consequence occurs for them (either disappointment in no surprises or maybe joy that they got to play with things sooner).
