We didn&#39;t end up joining that particular one, and<br/>\nlike you haven&#39;t found one yet that really excites us... We actually got a<br/>\nlittle discouraged and quit. It is still something that we would like to<br/>\nexplore, and finding the right group would be very excited to participate<br/>\nin. The time frame sounds right - I&#39;d love to &#39;listen in&#39; on your group and<br/>\nsee who and what&#39;s cookin&#39;!<br/>\n<br/>\nNina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: 23 Mar 2001 03:50:19 -0000<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1051<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 11<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thu, 22 Mar 2001 19:22:37 -0000<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Intentional Community (WA)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For anyone interested, we are investigating the possibility of<br/>\n&gt; Cohousing, or a similar such ecovilliage community, in NW Washington<br/>\n&gt; most likely.  We are looking into existing communities, and thinking<br/>\n&gt; over beginning putting together our own, should we not be able to<br/>\n&gt; find what we are looking for.  We will be moving up there in the next<br/>\n&gt; several years, with the time frame depending on what we eventually<br/>\n&gt; decide to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now we own our home in SE Idaho, and would not be able to<br/>\n&gt; liquidate that for at least a year.  We do not want to rent, as we<br/>\n&gt; consider that a waste of money, but may have to out of necessity,<br/>\n&gt; until we get settled on land for our more permanent home.  Our<br/>\n&gt; primary consideration right now is to get over there (to NW WA) so<br/>\n&gt; that we can be local to investigate properties and opportunities,<br/>\n&gt; and begin forming relationships with prospective community members.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are not looking to create an exclusive or exclusionary community,<br/>\n&gt; and are not limiting based on race, sex, sexual orientation,<br/>\n&gt; religion, age, physical condition, etc.  We will however, be looking<br/>\n&gt; for mentally sound members who can contribute to the greater good of<br/>\n&gt; the community  We are looking more for folks with a general attitude<br/>\n&gt; of earth stewardship and openmindedness who can enrich and diversify<br/>\n&gt; a community living lightly on the land, in individual family homes<br/>\n&gt; around shared common space, gardens, land and group facilities.  One<br/>\n&gt; group facility would be a group house, with space for optional shared<br/>\n&gt; meals, socializing, child care, entertainment, laundry, projects,<br/>\n&gt; crafts, meetings, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone with interest and or/experience in this area is welcome to<br/>\n&gt; contact us privately and offer advice, encouragement, ideas, etc.  I<br/>\n&gt; have begun an email group for sharing on this topic, limited to<br/>\n&gt; serious prospective community members, as well as those with<br/>\n&gt; experience in community living, sustainable living and related<br/>\n&gt; issues, from whom we can all learn.  Contact me if you are interested<br/>\n&gt; in discussing it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17104,"nextTopicId":17226}}
