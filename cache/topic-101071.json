At home, even now with my boys ages 10, 12, and <br/>\n14, sometimes I&#39;ll say,  &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to your room?&quot; and they&#39;ll say <br/>\n&quot;How come I&#39;m being punished?&quot; and I&#39;ll say, &quot;It isn&#39;t punishment and you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to go there, but I thought you might like to play with something <br/>\nor read or whatever instead of argue or fight.  I just want you to split up <br/>\nfor now.&quot;  Then they either go to their room or outside or ask if they can <br/>\ngo in my room or say &quot;We won&#39;t fight anymore, we&#39;re in the middle of a game&quot; <br/>\nand I say, &quot;Okay.&quot;  That&#39;s as close to the negative &quot;time-outs&quot; as we get <br/>\nanymore.  It seems to bring peace.  I think when they were younger they <br/>\nneeded more direct help, as in &quot;Would you like to do _____ with me? [Fill in <br/>\nthe blank with &quot;go outside&quot; &quot;play a game&quot; &quot;make something&quot; &quot;watch a <br/>\nvideo/movie/TV&quot; etc.].  Now that they&#39;re older they can usually decide on <br/>\nsomething to do for themselves, though I still offer to do something with <br/>\nthem if they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101053,"nextTopicId":101074}}
