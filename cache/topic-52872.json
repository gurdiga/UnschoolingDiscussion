Even though I love my family I was soooo glad to get<br/>\nhome.  Then......<br/>\n<br/>\nthe woman who adopted my Marsie&#39;s birth sisters came to visit.  She<br/>\ncontrolled what the girls said, ate, watched, played, listened to and not in<br/>\na gentle manner.  She truly believes with all her heart that these lovely<br/>\nlittle girls would be sluts and drug addicts except for the fact that she is<br/>\n&quot;training them up&quot; right.  I can&#39;t imagine what it must be like to have your<br/>\nmother think so little of you.  I was a nervous wreck by the time they left<br/>\nand the little girls seemed terribly sad.  Even dh (who usually doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnotice much) said the girls didn&#39;t look like they were having fun at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad that I have this space to breathe easy and know that  there are<br/>\npeople who truly love and respect their children.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52929,"nextTopicId":52946}}
