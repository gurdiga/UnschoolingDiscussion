Pointing out the educational aspects of something is confused to begin with as is<br/>\npointed out below i.e.  everything is educational.  The setting of &quot;educational&quot; priorities is<br/>\nsomething that the learner and the world, interacting together establish.  Being able to<br/>\nrecognize what I need to know, need to learn, am interested in learning are the most important<br/>\nskills.  A person doesn&#39;t ever really get them if someone is overtly or covertly directing<br/>\ntheir learning. It is of course very hard to avoid because most of us have been &quot;schooled&quot; half<br/>\nto death and hardly know what it looks like or feels like to be self-directed in one&#39;s<br/>\nactivities.  This self-direction is never in a void... it is in the context of one&#39;s family,<br/>\nfriends and community which is different for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-direction is (contrary to lots of propaganda) at odds with our culture insofar as<br/>\nobedience to authority is one of the main underpinnings of our consumer /consuming society.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere I feel better getting that off my chest. JH<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Diane from KS responded:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it depends on their age.  If they&#39;re older and need the<br/>\n&gt; reassurance that they are learning,  then it might be a good idea.  Otherwise,  I feel like<br/>\n&gt; it detracts from the fact that everything is educational and<br/>\n&gt; classifies activities as good or bad.  That doesn&#39;t mean that you<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be excited right along with them about the new things that<br/>\n&gt; they learn,  just that you don&#39;t need to point out specifically<br/>\n&gt; &quot;educational&quot; things.

I <br/>\nwonder why that happens.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he continued to be interested in the same phenomenon the next day and <br/>\nthe day after that, I said, &quot;Hmmm...that reminds me of an experiment I saw, <br/>\nwhere you can spin a bucket of water over your head and the water won&#39;t fall <br/>\nout.  Wanna try it?&quot;  (Still no official terms, just fun exploration.)  He <br/>\nresponded with great enthusiasm, and when we were reading the experiment <br/>\ninstructions together, I said, &quot;Oh, it says here that&#39;s called centrifugal <br/>\nforce.  Neat!&quot;  He said the word a few times and we used it in conversation <br/>\nmore while watching the clothes spin in the washing machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s okay to put a name with the __whatever__ if the interest is <br/>\nthere, as long as it doesn&#39;t serve to separate the &quot;educational aspect&quot; from <br/>\nthe fact that it&#39;s a neat thing to mess around with.  Of course, I also don&#39;t <br/>\nthink it&#39;s inappropriate to leave the official terms out of the play.  He has <br/>\nbeen playing Logical Journey of the Zoombinis for almost a year now and has <br/>\nno idea about x-axis and y-axis, graphing, probability, and all the other <br/>\nalgebraic (algebra, right?) functions encompassed by that program.
