It is part of the<br/>\nchild/parents indoctrination process and part of the constant selling of the<br/>\nnext year&#39;s school budget. (In my state, CT, each town collects property<br/>\ntaxes that pays the lion&#39;s share of school spending. A small percent is<br/>\nincome taxes collected by the state and returned from state coffers to the<br/>\nlocal school districts)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little dears are told that their school can&#39;t provide for their proper<br/>\neducation because the taxpayers are refusing to raise the budgets. They<br/>\nchoose a catagory, say band instruments, and the kids are sent door to door<br/>\nselling something that nobody needs, and they raise a little, or a lot of<br/>\nmoney.

It&#39;s part of the anti-community,<br/>\nself-alienation routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can use it as one more excuse for their failure to educate those kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the school folks can ALWAYS find something that they are lacking -- so<br/>\ncan everybody -- and then claim they need money for it. This is the process<br/>\nof keeping the public pre-occupied with the public schools. It not only<br/>\nhelps to keep the kids&#39; time totally controlled by the schools, but it<br/>\nincludes the parents and all other residents. They run one scam after<br/>\nanother keeping the ball rolling for school employees.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose is Public Relations for next year&#39;s outrageous budget that<br/>\nincludes pay increases for two or three times as many employees as are<br/>\nneeded to run a decent school.
