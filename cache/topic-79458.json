More than anything, you need to set <br/>\nthe mood; darkness, weird, soft light (strange angles or flickering <br/>\nis good), scarey sounds and soft eerie music.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHanging groups threads from various places will freak people out.  <br/>\nYou can&#39;t see them like fake webs but you *feel* them. &lt;shudder&gt; The <br/>\nstartle effect is the best way to scare even if it turns out to be <br/>\nsomething funny.  Have someone who&#39;s hiding just reach out and <br/>\nlightly touch people as they go by or jump out and then run.  A loud <br/>\nbumb like a door slam when it&#39;s quiet works too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways have someone behind the scenes making subtle noises; shaking <br/>\nchains, moving things around, maoning, squeaking doors and banging.  <br/>\nCritters moving along the floor like a wind up toy is fun.  Always, <br/>\nalways tell a story to go with the house of something terrible that <br/>\nhappened there and all the strange things that happen that are always <br/>\nworse on HALLOWEEN!<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of it should be understanded.  Let people&#39;s imaginations do all <br/>\nthe work.  Trying to be very obvious just looks really fake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe scariest thing that I&#39;ve ever experienced was riding on a haunted <br/>\nhayride and the person next to me suddenly disappeared when someone <br/>\nsilently reached up and grabbed her.
