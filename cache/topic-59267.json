Maybe the <br/>\nbest way to use Teach Your Child.... is for the parent to read it. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up homeschooling speech therapy too. My insurance approved a <br/>\nset of exercises, then the speech therapy office thought they didn&#39;t, so <br/>\nthey offered us a reduced package where we went four times and paid <br/>\ndirectly. I took hand written notes from the therapist and transcribed <br/>\nthem and used the exercises to help my daughter at home. It turned out <br/>\nthat a big problem for her speaking clearly was just a very minor tongue <br/>\nholding thing. Once she became aware of it her speech dramatically <br/>\nimproved in a short time. She had pediatric dental problems and lost her <br/>\nfront teeth early and that probably helped contribute to the lack of <br/>\nawareness. So, I am glad we went. Found out later that my insurance <br/>\nwould have covered it and they would have set us up for the maximum <br/>\namount covered by our insurance -- 25 sessions. I think that would have <br/>\nbeen way too much &quot;school&quot; for us.

I try to answer their specific questions as they come<br/>\nup, and bring things to their attention that might relate to that interest.<br/>\nI do have a fair amount of &quot;learning toys&quot; around my house.  I bought a lot<br/>\nof it before I was introduced to unschooling.   I have kept a lot of it,<br/>\nbecause my kids enjoy PLAYING with it.  I enjoy playing with them or<br/>\nwatching them play and noticing what they are learning, but I have let go of<br/>\nfeeling that there must be a particular outcome from using those items.<br/>\nThey love to make geometric designs with cuisenaire rods, for instance.<br/>\nThis morning, I had the scrabble letters out to help me do the Jumble<br/>\npuzzle.  My 7yod took two letters and asked me what it said.  She repeated<br/>\nthe sound.  Then she added a new letter and did the same thing.  She got up<br/>\nto 6 or 7 letters.  It was pretty hard to pronounce, since it was mostly<br/>\nconsonants!  When she added an &quot;s&quot; I said, now you made it plural, and said<br/>\nthe new word.  Then, she got out some paper and folded it to make a little<br/>\nbook.  She said she was making a book to help kids learns to read.  She made<br/>\na list of &quot;_at&quot; words on the first page, then &quot;_an&quot; words.   She asked me if<br/>\nI could think of any more.  I said wan, but she said that would be too hard<br/>\nfor kids because it didn&#39;t sound the same as the other &quot;_an&quot; words.  Then<br/>\nshe said it was enough for now, and went off to do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting thing, is that my not-yet-reader loves to write.  She<br/>\nwrites a lot, either copying things or asking me to spell them for her.  She<br/>\nnow knows how to write many words on her own, even though she can&#39;t always<br/>\nread what she has written, can&#39;t read the same word in another context.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some ideas that might, or might not! be helpful in your situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7yod loves her board books that have one word for page.  She &quot;reads&quot; them<br/>\nto us often.  She has also memorized a couple of short books and reads them<br/>\nto us.  I have heard that many children learn to read by memorizing a book,<br/>\nthen at some point connecting how the printed word matches what they are<br/>\nsaying.  (Does that make sense?)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about Richard Scary&#39;s Biggest Word Book Ever?  I loved that book when I<br/>\nwas a kid.  It has little stories that you can read to her, and if she<br/>\nreally wants to read, it is full of pictures with labels.  If she changes<br/>\nher mind about learning to read right now, it can be just another book in<br/>\nthe house and you won&#39;t have wasted your money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;snip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have the feeling that she actually wants more of a workbook<br/>\n </span></blockquote>type thing, where she is reading words etc. and well, learning to do what<br/>\nher older sibs already are doing. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of inexpensive workbook/coloring books for young kids.  Why<br/>\ndo you think she wants a workbook?  Are her older sibs schooling?  Are her<br/>\nolder siblings doing workbooks, and that&#39;s why she wants them?  Just be sure<br/>\nthat a workbook doesn&#39;t become something she feels she *must* do or that she<br/>\nthinks that is the only way to learn how to read.  Be careful to not go<br/>\noverboard and push her beyond what she is interested in.  Be willing to let<br/>\nher stop.  (It sounds like you are prepared to do that.)  She might be quite<br/>\nhappy to play at reading, rather than truly be reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral years ago, my mom bought us a phonics sticker book.  Each page had<br/>\none set of words, like &quot;_at&quot; with a bunch of words that could be made from<br/>\nthat sound and with pictures to help them figure out the word.  Truthfully,<br/>\nmy kids haven&#39;t used the book a lot, but it might be just the ticket for a<br/>\nyoung child who is asking to learn how to read.  Just checked and I still<br/>\nhave it.

I did use<br/>\nBob books with my first child, but she took off reading on her own without<br/>\never going beyond the first set.  If Bob books are not enough for her, you<br/>\ncan worry about that when they become not enough.

This was about 13 <br/>\nyears ago. Anyway, it was called the Phonics Factory. Had games and all <br/>\nkinds of things to do. Well Tara never used all the stuff or even in the <br/>\norder it was suppose to go. It also had some audio tapes too. I saved it all <br/>\nthe years and had it laying around for Joseph and Sierra. By that time I had <br/>\nonly saved one phonics book, the tapes and the smaller reading books that <br/>\nwent with it. The kids pulled it out every now and then to listen or play. <br/>\nSometimes a few days in a row, then nothing for month or two. It&#39;s not what <br/>\n&quot;got&quot; them reading but it was something fun for them while they figured out <br/>\nwhat they wanted and how to go about it. The thing they really liked was the <br/>\nlittle books. Read along with fat cat and dandy duck and so on. The books <br/>\nwere progressive and it started out with small sentences and then a picture <br/>\nof exactly what the sentence was. Point being, made the kids feel like they <br/>\nwere reading when they just weren&#39;t ready to actually read themselves. It <br/>\nwas a fun thing. I&#39;m sure you could find regular books like that for your <br/>\nchild. That way she would feel like she was reading and having fun and not <br/>\npushing herself or getting frustrated. Even some rhyming books like Dr. <br/>\nSeuss might make her feel like she&#39;s reading. All the rest will come when <br/>\nshe&#39;s ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
