It can be encouraged and nurtured, but it can&#39;t be <br/>\ncreated.  It can be squished and destroyed, but unschooling won&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people don&#39;t come upon anything that lights them all up inside until <br/>\nthey&#39;re older, maybe grown.  It&#39;s okay.

Not reading didn&#39;t keep them from learning all KINDS of <br/>\nthings that were &quot;beyond their grade level&quot;--whereas kids in school who learn <br/>\nto read are thereafter presented with history and science at their reading <br/>\nlevel.  Babified, small-words, short sentences, easy questions to answer.  My <br/>\nkids have never experienced any of that &quot;The Queen gave Columbus a boat.  She <br/>\ngave him sailors,&quot; kind of history.  They pick it up as adults do, from <br/>\nmuseums, historical sites, movies, paintings, discussions about why &quot;New <br/>\nMexico,&quot; why so many Swedes in Minnesota, where did our ancestors come from, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24566,"nextTopicId":24498}}
