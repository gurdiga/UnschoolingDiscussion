You would be suprised....They do.. The guys are always <br/>\nfloored, but alot don&#39;t take the scrap piece once it is cut I talk to the <br/>\nguys back there .. I asked them why would they cut and and not take the left <br/>\nover piece.....<br/>\nThey said...people just want to take their measured piece. <br/>\nI aksed if they always leave good piece like that...he said yep.......they <br/>\ndon&#39;t know why people do it, but they do. They said they would not personally <br/>\ndo it, but people do and I guess they look at it as making another profit.<br/>\nThere was this 2x8 piece of 3/4 in strand board left in their bend.... I <br/>\nasked the the guy why did they take the rest and he said tht he didn&#39;t know, <br/>\nand I said this piece for a 4x8 piece is 6 bucks and he said I know and they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want the rest.... Look at it this way.....the sold that piece for full <br/>\nprice and turned around and sold the left over at a discount. It&#39;s all about <br/>\nmoney......They do not have to worry about throwing it out, they can make a <br/>\nprofit. <br/>\n<br/>\nYES they do pay FULL price for  item, they do not charge them for a partial <br/>\npiece or half of that item.... Menards does not do that either..... That is <br/>\nthe policy of the Menards and Home Depot here...<br/>\nExample.........if a piece is $6 and you want half of that piece.....you will <br/>\npay the six dollars or if you buy a 4x8 of paneling and you want just a 2x8 <br/>\npiece, you still have to pay for the 4x8 regardless.<br/>\nALL the home depots here are like that here so that&#39;s why I always take my <br/>\nscrap with me....heck, I paid for it. That&#39;s the thing with these big home <br/>\nimprovement stores....<br/>\nIf you buy a piece, you pay for the price of that piece no matter if they cut <br/>\nit or not. I wonder if they just leave it since cutting is free.......<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, know I am going to collect pieces to build a sandbox when they leave the <br/>\npressure treated stuff.....<br/>\nIn fact there where 2 pieces of 4x4 that were 2 ft long that someone didn&#39;t <br/>\nneed or want when it was cut from a 8ft piece.
