What I<br/>\nwould like to know are your particulars, MINUS THE NAMES.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought up quite a few questions as I&#39;m not sure in which<br/>\ndirection the article will go nor what information will be helpful in<br/>\nwriting something that has a theme and makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the questions sound judgmental but they aren&#39;t.
