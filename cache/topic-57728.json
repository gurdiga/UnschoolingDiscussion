Draw a life size outline of a child and put <br/>\nit up on the wall. Are your scouts Wolfs or Tiger Cubs? Anyway, pick out a <br/>\nbadge or some insignia that they are familiar with and make copies. The <br/>\nobject is to pin the badge in the correct spot on the drawing of the scout.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelay races: Have kids divide into 2 teams. Have them hop on one foot from <br/>\none side of the room to the other while holding a peanut in a spoon. <br/>\nAlternately, have them get down on all fours and blow the peanuts, or perhaps <br/>\nsomething a little heavier.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids form a circle with one person in the middle blind folded. The non-blind <br/>\nfolded kids  speak and the one in the center has to guess who it is. If he is <br/>\nright, the person who is recognized has to get in the center.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57709,"nextTopicId":57734}}
