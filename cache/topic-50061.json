But we seem to have so many cellists around here that I just<br/>\nreplied to Tia on the list.  My apologies to the bored and the unmusical,<br/>\nand my condolences to those who play the &quot;wrong&quot; instrument!  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bach suites are sort of the pinacle of unaccompanied music, but there<br/>\nare several Baroque pieces that are more easily playable than them.  Try:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph Bodin de Boismortier (nice name, huh?!), Acht Kleine Stucke, op. 40<br/>\nthese are for cello with optional accomp; they&#39;re very nice alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nDomenico Gabrielli, 7 Ricercari<br/>\nI like #6 and 7 the best, and #1 and 2 are very blah, by warning.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorg Philipp Telemann, Fantasia for Cello Solo, transcribed by Valter<br/>\nDespalj.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Romantic folk preferred larger groups, so only not much for cello alone.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a piece by Klengel, Caprice Op. 43, which is deadly hard, and Max<br/>\nReger wrote 3 suites for solo cello.  If you know the Bach, you&#39;ll realize<br/>\nthat Reger did, too.  His 1st suite is based on Bach&#39;s 1st.  (There are nice<br/>\nthings in the Reger, but the man wrote mountains of music, and didn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto know how to stop when he ran out of good ideas.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a LOT of contemporary music, including things by Bloch, Britten,<br/>\nCrumb, Hindemith, etc. that are pretty tough.  However, try:<br/>\n<br/>\nDmitri Kabalevsky, 5 Studies in Major and Minor.  These are really nice,<br/>\ntonal (back and forth from major to minor -- a nice effect), and readable!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Schickele wrote a serious piece for unaccompanied cello called<br/>\nVermillion Suite, which is great.  He also wrote 2 P.D.Q. Bach &quot;Suites for<br/>\nCello All By Its Lonesome&quot;.  Both are hilarious; I like #2 better.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Muczynski, Gallery Suite, is based on paintings by the American<br/>\nartist, Charles Birchfield.  Very pretty and approachable but still with<br/>\nsome modern harmonies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Horvit, Lydian Suite (published by Southern Music Co.)  He&#39;s still<br/>\nalive and composing in Texas; he&#39;s Jewish and his music sounds Jewish.  This<br/>\nis my favorite of everything listed here, and well worth the effort to<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nRudolf Matz, Suite &quot;Lights and Shadows&quot;, Suite in C major, Tema con<br/>\nVariazioni.  They&#39;re all nice, but not great, inspiring stuff.  Very<br/>\nplayable, and tuneful.  I use it for teaching; it&#39;s about Suzuki book 4<br/>\nlevel, if that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, if you like a little more variety in your music, try:<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Eby&#39;s Celtic Passage for Solo Cello.<br/>\nSean Grissom, Liberty (Fiddling for cello) or Cherry Blossom (Sakura,<br/>\nSakura)<br/>\nor<br/>\nBenjamin Boone&#39;s Buffing the Gut (A Jazz Etude for Solo Cello).  This one is<br/>\nfabulous, but technically killer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI buy music from Shar (1-800-248-SHAR) or Brodt (1-800-438-4129).  Hope that<br/>\nhelps; let me know if you can&#39;t find something and need a publsher or other<br/>\ninfo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\np.s.  There&#39;s some tenor clef in this bunch; you won&#39;t learn it without<br/>\nplaying it, so I didn&#39;t pull it all out.  None of these run into the<br/>\nstratosphere, so not much treble clef.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50153,"nextTopicId":50311}}
