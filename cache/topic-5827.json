Ahhhhh, I just LOVE hearing/talking about<br/>\ngrowing....&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried and tried and tried to convince my dh that we should turn the<br/>\nback part of our (narrow, not very deep) backyard into MY GARDEN FANTASY,<br/>\nlol.  His argument for not doing it is because that part of the lawn is a<br/>\nlittle lower, and traps all the water and is the only really healthy spot of<br/>\ngrass we have, LOL.  Actually, the alternative is to use part of my front<br/>\nlawn where it would get the am/early afternoon sun.  Although my yard is<br/>\nsmall, it is VERY shady from some beautiful old trees that I will not part<br/>\nwith, helps keep the house cool.  So, to combat that issue, on the north<br/>\nside of the house, I put an old picnic bench on the far side of the<br/>\ndrive(just about full sun) and grew my tomatoes in recycled buckets, or<br/>\nwhatever looked big enough to me.  Last year was the first year I tried it,<br/>\nand it was heaven to look out my kitchen window and see my babies thriving.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past fall, I bought loads of tulip bulbs and added them to my existing<br/>\nbulb collection.  I didn&#39;t dig up the old ones, but with the new ones, I<br/>\nthrew them in groupings and planted them where they lay.  I can&#39;t wait to<br/>\nsee how it turns out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWondering what that groundhog will say!<br/>\n<br/>\nkaren mowery</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Brynn Panchot","from":"&quot;Brynn Panchot&quot; &lt;panchot@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bJdWC_KV-R3ogLoi5ZsKmuh6Df8LooUGoK5zB_L9ug3Cg4T0AktcK9uImIc8jDmI0PhKWgKqJI0J5pbaxdFmkWeGqfq6B4fsV-4wvAg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: Quiet Today","postDate":"948951033","msgId":5832,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zODQuNTgzMi45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5827,"nextInTopic":5845,"prevInTime":5831,"nextInTime":5833,"topicId":5827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"WE HAVE BULBS UP!
