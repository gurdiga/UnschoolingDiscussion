It&#39;s so easy to connect with others and take a<br/>\npeak into their lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t posted in a long while about what we&#39;ve been up to.  Last summer<br/>\nwe got our second horse and after a while we realized she just wasn&#39;t going<br/>\nto work out for Lilly, aged 9.  We listed her for sale all fall and recently<br/>\ngot an offer for a trade.  (Almost seemed too good to be true)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe woman who came to see our horse said she had a horse that would be a<br/>\ngreat confidence builder for Lilly and we went to see him.  He was sweet<br/>\nalthough he was a little forward.  We took the barn owner back with us to<br/>\ntry him a second time and we decided that we would take him. &lt;shriek of<br/>\nexcitement&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLilly can handle him although she does need to build some trust with him so<br/>\nthat she knows he isn&#39;t going to buck her off like that last horse did.<br/>\nHe&#39;s been here for just over two days and he has just the sweetest<br/>\npersonality.   He really seems to love to interact with people and that is<br/>\njust what Lilly hoped for.  He loves her kisses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls are off visiting friends for the day today but will be back in<br/>\ntime to help at the barn tonight.  It&#39;s what we all live for lately.  (I<br/>\nmistyped LOVE for LIVE and really that&#39;s more appropriate...It&#39;s what we all<br/>\nlove for lately.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy little girls are growing up.  They never used to like to go anywhere<br/>\nwithout me.
