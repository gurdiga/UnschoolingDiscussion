That&#39;s what we parents do. But I doubt your&#39;re sitting her <br/>\ndown and insisting she follow a cooking or plant life or (hopefully) reading <br/>\ncurriculum. That&#39;s the kind of usage or connection to the word teaching that <br/>\nwe try to stay away from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Getting back to phonics books....Have you heard anything about Reading <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Reflex?  It&#39;s a&#39;new(?) method of phonics where there are no rules to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;learn...and they use terms like &#39;sound pictures&#39; (the letters that <br/>\n&gt;&gt;represent the sounds in words).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow. Your daughter is only 3 right? Have you tried the old (and inexpensive) <br/>\nletters on the fridge like Ned suggested? I haven&#39;t seen Reading Reflex, but <br/>\nI know Conor really understood letter sounds using pictures instead of just <br/>\nletters. But I would think that could be accomplished by just cutting out <br/>\npictures from a magazine and sticking them on an index card. For example, a <br/>\npicture of a carrot on one side/a &quot;c&quot; on the other. A picture of an apple/an <br/>\n&quot;a&quot;. A picture of a top/a &quot;t&quot;. Put carrot/apple/top together and the 3 <br/>\nstarting sounds are c-a-t. If your daughter is enjoying it and asking <br/>\nquestions about letters and sounds, this could be a fun game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also remembering that computer games were another fun learning tool. <br/>\nGames like the early Jump Starts (K-grade 3) were my kids favorites. (After <br/>\nthat they got too schooly for them.) Reader Rabbit, Arthur&#39;s Reading Race, <br/>\netc. were all fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39730,"nextTopicId":39955}}
