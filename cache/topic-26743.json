But you might want to look for a league that has A, B, and C teams, <br/>\nor gold, silver and bronze or something like that.  Where I live only <br/>\nfastball (sofball) is available, but the teams are divided first by age and <br/>\nthen by ability.  The A team is for the more experienced or talented, very <br/>\ncompetitive kids.  The B team is less competitive.  The C team is for the <br/>\nkids who either just want to play for fun or are less skilled and/or <br/>\nexperienced than the other kids.  That way is safer for the less <br/>\nexperienced kids.  Plus they aren&#39;t getting hassled by the stronger <br/>\nplayers.  And the stronger players aren&#39;t being held back by the less <br/>\nexperienced ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have to divide by age to make the competition fair.  Otherwise a team <br/>\ncould pad itself up with older players that they said had lower <br/>\nability.
