The natives were getting restless so I <br/>\ndecided to take a walk. Two of my children dd 2 and dd 6 happily agreed to <br/>\ncome with me. While taking a walk in the rain we came to a grated sewer drain. We <br/>\nstood there for quite a while watching the water flow in from two drains then <br/>\ngo out one larger one. We became entranced. My six year old then became VERY <br/>\nexcited and asked numerous questions about the creation of the sewer system, <br/>\nwho invented it, when, where, why, etc.... I answered as much as I knew, then <br/>\nwhen Dad came home he in turn did the same (thankfully he&#39;s much more <br/>\nknowledgeable on the subject). She was FAIRLY content but would like more info in books <br/>\nor videos. I found a few of each from our local library but still not enough. <br/>\n(I actually found one video for the actual sewer system in our area!!) She <br/>\nhas always been interested in architecture in various degrees but now has a new <br/>\nfound excitement to explore unknown territories in her world. <br/>\n   Any suggestions will be appreciated!!! Thanks in advance.<br/>\n                                     Kimberly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91576,"nextTopicId":91568}}
