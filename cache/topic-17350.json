I have three children who have never been to<br/>\n&gt; ps and after about 5 years of deschooling myself I<br/>\n&gt; think I am ready to take the unschooling plunge.  I<br/>\n&gt; have seen how it works with my children and have<br/>\n&gt; watched my son figure out test questions (Iowa basic<br/>\n&gt; given for my benefit only) that where never taught<br/>\n&gt; to him. So we are here to learn more!<br/>\n&gt;   BUT: the question that brought me out of lurking<br/>\n&gt; was the one about Christian groups verses<br/>\n&gt; non-denominational groups.  About 2 years ago I<br/>\n&gt; helped  form a group in our area and it has grown to<br/>\n&gt; about 30 families today.  We basically came together<br/>\n&gt; because we where all excluded from the large<br/>\n&gt; Christian group in our area that asks for a<br/>\n&gt; statement of faith to be signed.  Most of us where<br/>\n&gt; not even welcomed to converse with the members once<br/>\n&gt; we did not mention the appropriate curriculum.  My<br/>\n&gt; dilemma today is that the head man of the local<br/>\n&gt; large Christian group is now on are email list.  He<br/>\n&gt; just kind of sneaked in and many of us feel<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortably with his presence however we also<br/>\n&gt; embrace the word &quot;inclusive&quot;.  So my question to all<br/>\n&gt; of you is How would you handle this person on your<br/>\n&gt; email list?
