Nice to see you on this list too - I enjoy your Florida-homeschool<br/>\n(also on onelist.com).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in Orlando, and have an almost 10yo girl and 6yo boy.

A couple weeks ago, we went to the Millennium Village (a new<br/>\npavilion in Epcot).  I let the kids do what they wanted, and there are lots of<br/>\nactivities there, so we spent a couple hours.  Time after time, as I sat back<br/>\nand let my kids play, I would see kids come up to an activity, barely spend<br/>\n30 seconds at it, and the parents grab their hands and say &quot;come on, we&#39;ve<br/>\ngot lots to do...&quot; and the kids never did really experience the activity!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is such a great time of year too - Epcot&#39;s Candlelight Processional, ice<br/>\nskating at Downtown Disney, &quot;snow&quot; nightly in Celebration - lots of fun, and<br/>\nthe crowds won&#39;t be here until Christmas!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin<br/>\nOrlando, FL<br/>\n :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35242,"nextTopicId":35391}}
