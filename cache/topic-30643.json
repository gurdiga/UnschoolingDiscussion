I&#39;m taking note of them. I don&#39;t think I ever had trouble with dairy foods, but in the last few years I have tried soy milk and now that is all I drink. Regular (skim) milk that we were drinking is now not appealing to me. Soy just seems so much &quot;cleaner&quot; (for lack of a better term). No filmy consistency that regular milk has.
