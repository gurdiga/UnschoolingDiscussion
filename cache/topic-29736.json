I agree.. neutering will make a big <br/>\ndifference in the <br/>\ndog.<br/>\n <br/>\n(for the inqui-ree..) <br/>\nGet lots of little doggie treats and reward the good behavior and <br/>\nignore the bad. <br/>\nMost dogs want to please their owners and will do what it takes to <br/>\nget your love.<br/>\nCrate training is very effective if done properly.

Since this <br/>\nparticular dog <br/>\nhas had a bad experience with the crate, you may have difficulty <br/>\nchanging his mind <br/>\nabout a crate but I&#39;d at least try *really* hard.  Maybe new bedding <br/>\nand toys in it <br/>\nwould help along with putting him in for very short periods of time. <br/>\n(do *not* <br/>\nreward him by letting him out if he is barking and not behaving as <br/>\nyou&#39;d like). <br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Carothers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, 08 Dec 2001 21:52:53 -0800, Pam Hartley wrote:<br/>\n&gt;I was kidding about the pliers at home.
