Here&#39;s the review from <br/>\nthat page, but if you put in <br/>\nPolly whole child <br/>\n(at google.com)<br/>\nyou get lots of review and offerings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e   <br/>\nby Authors:  Polly B. Berends <br/>\nReleased: July, 1997 <br/>\nISBN: 0060928182 <br/>\nPaperback <br/>\n<br/>\nWhole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e &gt; Customer Review #1:   <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n Beautiful <br/>\n<br/>\nI discovered this at the discount table of a bookstore in Lexington, <br/>\nKentucky. It does not get old or outdated.<br/>\nHow easily this book could have drifted off into self-indulgent Freudian <br/>\npsychobabble, Fundamentalist moralism or New Age narcissism--all of which Alice <br/>\nMiller has warned us against--in the hands of a less gifted writer. The fact <br/>\nthat it doesnt at any time in 340-plus pages is nothing short of miraculous. <br/>\nPolly Berends not only challenges ones view of parenting and loving, but also of <br/>\nChristianity and culture and the universe itself, by bringing mysticism back to <br/>\nthe modern Christian mind while not alienating those of other (or no <br/>\nparticular) faiths. Filled with transcendent prose, quotes of everything from Buddhist <br/>\nsacred text to the New Testament to e.e. cumming poetry, and the writers own <br/>\nheart (the heart of a proud mother and wife who walks with God), this is a <br/>\ntruly beautiful work that made my mind scream what was important about my <br/>\npersonal relationship with my son to me, above the distractions of my ego, with <br/>\nvirtually every page. <br/>\nConsider yourself the child, and this book will help you raise yourself. And <br/>\nthen imagine what kind of real parent you can be while following its lessons. <br/>\nThis is the ultimate holiday, Mother/Fathers Day or birthday gift for anyone <br/>\nwith children, bar none.<br/>\nBeautiful.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e &gt; Customer Review #2:   <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n One of the Spiritual Classics of This Century <br/>\n<br/>\nI had the fortune to begin to read this book 10 years before our twins were <br/>\nborn. Whether you are a parent or not Berends statement of the perennial <br/>\nspiritual wisdom is to be savored and dipped into over and over again. The book is <br/>\nso rich, so moving, so poetic that frequently you will find that you need to <br/>\nstop and reflect on her words after a page or two.<br/>\nThis book, along with Berends unfortunately out-of-print &quot;Coming To Life&quot;, is <br/>\na true spiritual classic.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e &gt; Customer Review #3:   <br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n Spiritual Guidebook to New Parenthood <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery now and then a rare book appears which can change your life. This is <br/>\none. <br/>\nPolly Berrien Berends is wise and gentle. She brings lofty or deep spiritual <br/>\ninsights to the rubber-meets-the-road issues of daily parenting: how is one to <br/>\napproach fears of childbirth? How should one talk to a toddler? How does one <br/>\ndecide which toys to buy? <br/>\nI had the good fortune to read this book just prior to becoming a parent, and <br/>\nif possible, you should too. It is not a quick or easy read, rather a very <br/>\nmeaningful one. Sometimes I had to stop and think after only three or four <br/>\npages. But this was well worth it. <br/>\nIf you are already a parent, or if you may never become a parent, read this <br/>\nbook. Although it addresses parenting issues it is really a book about <br/>\nhuman-being-hood.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] OT: need baby shower present ideas","postDate":"1063728410","msgId":80589,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjIwMWMzN2M2ZCQ5ZjBmZDQwMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMzN2MyNSQ1MTM3ZWU0MCQ2NDA3YThjMEBQcmVzYXJpbz4="},"prevInTopic":80581,"nextInTopic":80590,"prevInTime":80588,"nextInTime":80590,"topicId":80565,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... at the end of this year.

There is a baby shower in October that I will be sending a present or two to.  They are really good people, yet are uneducated on our way of &quot;raising&quot; children.  I want to get them something that will make them think, yet be a nice gift, know what I mean?  The only thing that I can think of is maybe something like &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by William and Martha Sears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all ideas will be appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80629,"nextTopicId":80657}}
