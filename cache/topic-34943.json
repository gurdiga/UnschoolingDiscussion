Here is one interesting bit from it: &gt;&gt;Based on records of all <br/>\nreports of crime received from victims, officers who discover infractions, or <br/>\nother sources, law enforcement agencies across the country tabulate the <br/>\nnumber of Crime Index or Part I offenses brought to their attention each <br/>\nmonth. Specifically, the crimes reported to the FBI are murder and <br/>\nnonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, <br/>\nburglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever complaints of crime are determined through investigation to be <br/>\nunfounded or false, they are eliminated from an agency&#39;s count. The number of <br/>\n&quot;actual offenses known&quot; is reported to the FBI regardless of whether anyone <br/>\nis arrested for the crime, stolen property is recovered, or prosecution is <br/>\nundertaken.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot more - they make herculean attempts to keep the statistics <br/>\nconsistent - the whole point is to be able to make comparisons over time. The <br/>\ntrends, especially very noticeable ones, such as the decreased violent crime <br/>\nrate over the last decade, are probably quite accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Crime Rate","postDate":"1018940795","msgId":35019,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhMi5jNzkzMjIuMjllZDI3N2JAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35018,"nextInTopic":35031,"prevInTime":35018,"nextInTime":35020,"topicId":34943,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/16/02 12:56:13 AM, sugarcrafter@usintouch.com writes:  Perhaps your personal","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1641125551\">In a message dated 4/16/02 12:56:13 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sugarcrafter@...\">sugarcrafter@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Some of us have had far<br/>\nbroader lives than others  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps your personal incidents weren&#39;t on the TV news, but were they <br/>\nreported to the police?
