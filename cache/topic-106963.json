Our 14yo son is adopted.  He&#39;s been with us since age 11 and formally adopted since age 13.  His upbringing was filled with neglect and abuse.  In our family he&#39;s the oldest of 8.  He&#39;s the only one that goes to school, by his choice.<br/>\nThe obvious stated- I don&#39;t get to spend as much time with him.  He doesn&#39;t get to do all the fun things we do during the day (although he probly wouldn&#39;t want to come anyway).  He says that his sibs are spoiled and that everything is unfair to him.  Everyone tells me that this is normal teenager stuff, but it really takes it&#39;s toll on everyone.  <br/>\nI&#39;d love to have given him the same upbringing as our younger kids, but it wasn&#39;t possible.
