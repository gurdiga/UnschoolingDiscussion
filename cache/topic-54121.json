Carly spotted a large barn owl fly and land in an evergreen. <br/>\nFascinating to watch. This led us to look for owl pellets. Carly went inside; <br/>\nshe&#39;s not into &quot;owl puke.&quot; Found pellets filled with jaws, teeth, a skull, <br/>\nvertebrae, and extremities. Looked like two separate animals; no way the jaw <br/>\nmatched the skull. Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we found a &quot;crime scene.&quot; Finch feathers and blood scattered around a <br/>\nlog. Obviously something had eaten it. Eric collected the beautiful yellow <br/>\nfeathers. He made his own dream catcher out of the last batch he found. We <br/>\nbrought everything home and dissected the owl pellet. He plans to add it to <br/>\nhis nature shelf (a shelf filled with all the stuff he finds outside, <br/>\nincluding a dried bat, skulls, and a dried sparrow). After our walk, he <br/>\nworked on his Lego version of SIMS (he was inspired watching Carly play the <br/>\nSIMS computer game she got for Christmas). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m going to help Carly with our own Trading Spaces. We&#39;re sanding, <br/>\npriming and painting her bedroom furniture aqua. <br/>\n<br/>\nTonight we&#39;re going to watch UVa play Duke in women&#39;s basketball.<br/>\n<br/>\nA fun day,<br/>\nGinny <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54110,"nextTopicId":54112}}
