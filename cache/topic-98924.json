I&#39;ve realized that for all of my unschooling rhetoric, the bigger message <br/>\nthat has gotten through to them is that college is Very Important and that preparation <br/>\nrequires Hard Work.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night after a long heart to heart with our &quot;senior&quot; (and a week of soul searching with <br/>\nmy husband), we realized we had unwittingly done what we had never intended to do <br/>\nconsciously. We are both extremely frustrated with the school system seeing it up close <br/>\nnow. And my oldest suddenly realized last night that he doesn&#39;t want to waste another <br/>\nminute of his LIFE getting ready for something that he isn&#39;t even sure he wants to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a eureka moment. He&#39;s withdrawing on Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sophomore daughter is face-to-face with kids who wish they could go back in time to <br/>\nkill Shakespeare so that they wouldn&#39;t ahve to study him. She&#39;s taking classes where the <br/>\nteachers move kids to new seats if they are having too much fun with each other working <br/>\non a project. She is studying materials that we have already used (with more creativity and <br/>\nenergy) two-four years ago (Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, Clues to Acting <br/>\nShakespeare, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I felt like I had finally crossed all the way over the unschooling threshhold. The <br/>\nlittle nagging doubts and hold out thoughts were smashed beneath my oldest son&#39;s <br/>\nrealization that he will live first and figure out what to do with his LIFE later.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we&#39;ll see what my dd decides to do. But I am finally at peace that this nagging doubt <br/>\nabout the value of school is behind me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":182360290,"authorName":"SHYRLEY WILLIAMS","from":"=?iso-8859-1?q?SHYRLEY=20WILLIAMS?= &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Those pesky competitive feelings","postDate":"1094460868","msgId":99152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTA2MDg1NDI4Ljg0NTc4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjg2MjA0Lm1haWwudWtsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":99151,"nextInTopic":99164,"prevInTime":99151,"nextInTime":99153,"topicId":98924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1747704996\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and a secret disrespect for unschooling (at least the media-drenched <br/>\nparts).

I have finally gotten rid of it but I wouldn&#39;t recommend the method. Having Celyn who has cerebral palsy and brain damage has finally taught me what is important. And that is loving your kids and letting them be who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nCelyn may never know what a book is, let alone hold one. But she will know how to smile and be happy and she will know I love her. And thats the important thing. The rest, talking, seeing, academia, reading, building a weather station in the back yard, etc etc is all icing on the cake (or frosting as you lot say...) and thats the main thing really, for ALL children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they happy and do they know mum loves them.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

This week, for example -- I&#39;d been feeling sluggish, like we&#39;d spent too much time home last week (forgetting the multiple times we&#39;ve been to the museums & zoo in the last month).  Monday, we didn&#39;t do much but hang around the house -- I was feeling restless and guilty.  Tuesday, tho, went like this:  I stitched a cape to a t-shirt for Andy -- he played The Silver Snake Superhero (his creation) for a while; we went to the library, where we read a few books, and checked out several too.  Then off to the playground nearby, where I pitched and both boys hit the ball, I kicked the soccer ball with Dan, the boys chased (twice) a roadrunner until it got smart and jumped over the fence, they rode the bouncy toys and climbed the playset; we then hit the bank, bought lunch out and hit another playground.  Yesterday, Andy decided to make a card for my mil (her b&#39;day is<br/>\n coming up soon, she&#39;s been recovering from surgery and he realized she&#39;s feeling better).  He spent more than an hour drawing and coloring just the right picture (a dancining tiki on a surfboard, on a big wave) only to run out of room for the head.  We glued an extension on the homemade card and he finished his picture then dictated the greeting and signed his name.  His friend arrived for a playdate, we packed up our park toys and went to the playground.  The bigger boys played baseball, roamed all over the (huge) park, and had a great time.  Dan (3) was all over the playset, monkey bars, etc; we played freeze tag, dug a tunnel in the sand, and he showed off for a 3yo girl nearby (had to be for her, he&#39;s never that showy for me!).  He ran -- he runs just beautifully -- somehow I&#39;ve missed noticing that before today.  <br/>\n <br/>\nToday?  We&#39;re home again, dh has my car (his is in repair) so we&#39;re limited to the neighborhood park, and the boys are still asleep.  It feels okay to be kinda sluggish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy point is that we&#39;re often much more active and constantly learning as unschoolers than it looks to the ultra-organized, structured learning school-at-homers.  Our goal, tho, is to enjoy watching our kids unfold at their own pace and readiness -- their goal is to &#39;provide a better education (subjective to their opinion) than the schools.&#39;   We&#39;ve rejected their path -- they don&#39;t even begin to understand ours.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe don&#39;t need to compete with them -- we don&#39;t share the same destination.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!

It shows the kinds of things we do all day and how all the days look different. Of course, my kids are younger--7, 5 and 4--so it may be easy for someone to accept that but still question for the older kids. You&#39;re welcome to send her there. I&#39;m hoping that as my kids grow, I&#39;ll end up with a kind of document that can reassure people and serve as a resource for them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re uncomfortable answering that kind of a question, having a couple of resources that you could spout off might take the pressure off. You could just say, &quot;Oh, there are some wonderful resources that talk about exactly that--you should really check them out.&quot; Or, something of the sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, of course, doesn&#39;t get down to the deeper question of why you think you&#39;re not comfortable with unschooling at the cellular level. *g* I don&#39;t know what makes me confident; I doubt I &quot;get it&quot; any better than you do. It may be that my kids are still young and there&#39;s less doubting with Em not reading at 7 than there will be when she&#39;s 10. It may be that because of teaching and my research that I&#39;m more comfortable translating or seeing the learning in all kinds of things, not just schooly things. It&#39;ll be interesting for me to watch my own evolution--to see if the confidence stays or wavers. I have no words of wisdom on this front other than to tell you to just watch your kids, really sit back and observe them totally without bias and they&#39;re sure to amaze you!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154033277,"authorName":"Crystal","from":"&quot;Crystal&quot; &lt;crystal.pina@...&gt;","profile":"crystalinma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Those pesky competitive feelings","postDate":"1094099636","msgId":98980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNoNjdyaytkNTI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxMzZBMDNGLjMwMDA5MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":98978,"nextInTopic":98984,"prevInTime":98979,"nextInTime":98981,"topicId":98924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Betsy, were you at the conference?

Love this challenge! I like an acronym, because it kind of gives you a &quot;nickname&quot; to use if/when needed. It can also allow you to be slightly &quot;vague&quot; about who you are! How about CAL? &quot;Center for Alternative Learning&quot;? Something like that? Then, if you wanted to, you could throw &quot;School&quot; in if it better suited the occasion: CAL School. Um...CAIL?

Here&#39;s the deal:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to come up with an organization name - today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re a bunch of unschoolers, BUT here is what I want:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. sounds enough like a school name that it won&#39;t stand out when listed <br/>\namong 80 or so schools<br/>\n2. sounds enough like a youth group/organization that the local parks <br/>\ndepartment will let us camp in the youth group area<br/>\n3. sounds enough like an unschooling support organization or at least a <br/>\n&quot;learning support&quot; organization that we can sponsor speakers and hold <br/>\nworkshops and qualify as a nonprofit organization that does those <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nReasons:<br/>\n1. We want to set up an organization that can sponsor &quot;teams&quot; of <br/>\nhomeschooled kids doing things such as Destination Imagination. For <br/>\nthis we don&#39;t want to sound at all strange. We&#39;ve been doing it under <br/>\n&quot;DragonTree Home Learners&quot; and we feel that we&#39;ve experienced some <br/>\nanti-homeschooling discrimination from appraisers - many of whom are <br/>\nteachers - and we want to try it this year while competing on a more <br/>\nlevel playing field.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We want to camp out in our very lovely large regional park, which <br/>\nallows youth groups such as the YMCA and scouts to camp, but not <br/>\ninformal groups of individual families.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. We want to bring Sandra here to speak about unschooling and I want <br/>\nto give a series of talks about joyful mathematics.

I assume <br/>\nyou have to have a lofty purpose.  Have you put in words what your <br/>\npurpose is?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor coming up with a name, I&#39;m tempted to break the name into two <br/>\nparts.  There are some adjectives at the beginning of the name, and then <br/>\nat the end there is a noun: e.g. learners, people, group, school, or <br/>\nsome-word-that-sounds-like-school-but-is-a-little-different.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want probably some kind of more buttoned down adjectives than <br/>\n&quot;Dragon Tree&quot;.  And then the second half of the naming problem is what <br/>\nkind of noun do you want to be?  I&#39;d probably try to solve the noun part <br/>\nfirst, and then add some pleasant but possibly meaningless adjectives.  <br/>\nEither something geographic or something uplifting or something Latin &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI named our &quot;school&quot; Hillside Academy.  I picked &quot;academy&quot; because I <br/>\nreally didn&#39;t want to use the word &quot;school&quot;.  &quot;Hillside&quot; is a pun on my <br/>\nname (Hill) which notes that my son learns at my side.  But it sounds <br/>\nbland enough that it isn&#39;t obvious that it&#39;s got a joke embedded in it.  <br/>\n(I&#39;m not suggesting that you have to sneak a joke into your name.

Here&#39;s the deal:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to come up with an organization name - today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re a bunch of unschoolers, BUT here is what I want:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. sounds enough like a school name that it won&#39;t stand out when listed <br/>\namong 80 or so schools<br/>\n2. sounds enough like a youth group/organization that the local parks <br/>\ndepartment will let us camp in the youth group area<br/>\n3. sounds enough like an unschooling support organization or at least a <br/>\n&quot;learning support&quot; organization that we can sponsor speakers and hold <br/>\nworkshops and qualify as a nonprofit organization that does those <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nReasons:<br/>\n1. We want to set up an organization that can sponsor &quot;teams&quot; of <br/>\nhomeschooled kids doing things such as Destination Imagination. For <br/>\nthis we don&#39;t want to sound at all strange. We&#39;ve been doing it under <br/>\n&quot;DragonTree Home Learners&quot; and we feel that we&#39;ve experienced some <br/>\nanti-homeschooling discrimination from appraisers - many of whom are <br/>\nteachers - and we want to try it this year while competing on a more <br/>\nlevel playing field.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. We want to camp out in our very lovely large regional park, which <br/>\nallows youth groups such as the YMCA and scouts to camp, but not <br/>\ninformal groups of individual families.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. We want to bring Sandra here to speak about unschooling and I want <br/>\nto give a series of talks about joyful mathematics. To rent the rooms <br/>\nwe want to use, we have to pay over three times as much if we&#39;re not a <br/>\nnonprofit organization. We might want to have other speakers, too, in <br/>\nthe future.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. The DI team wants to do some fundraising. Local businesses will ONLY <br/>\nsupport nonprofit organizations or schools. Most DI teams are <br/>\nassociated with a school and do their fundraising that way, but ours is <br/>\nnot, of course. For example, local fast food places and restaurants <br/>\nwill have special nights where we get 10 percent of the spending by <br/>\nanybody coming in with one of our fliers. We need a nonprofit <br/>\norganization to sponsor us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I&#39;m picturing this like a venn diagram - three circles with an <br/>\noverlapping part in the center where all three conditions have to be <br/>\nsatisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any hope?<br/>\nWe&#39;re stymied.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99183,"nextTopicId":98887}}
