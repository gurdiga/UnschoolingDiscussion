It really WORKS better this way, Erin, rather than <br/>\ncoercing them in any way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was in a parenting class at school when Cameron was in 2nd grade. As usual, <br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of preaching to the choir, &#39;cause the folks that voluntarily <br/>\nshow up to this kind of thing ARE already decent parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway---there was a woman who bitched about her then 13-year-old would bust <br/>\na gut rather than do what the mother requested. Example: Mom would ask the <br/>\ndaughter to get out every morning as they backed out of the drive and pick up <br/>\nthe neighbor&#39;s newspaper and take it to her porch. Daughter would complain, <br/>\nbut grudgingly DO it &#39;cause Mom made her. She didn&#39;t want to, and Mom <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand WHY this was a problem. The neighbor was almost 90 years <br/>\nold, and this was such a sweet gesture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested that MOM get out and sweetly put the paper on the neighbor&#39;s <br/>\nporch. As she returned to the car, she should say (once) that Mrs. Smith is <br/>\nso old and frail that I&#39;m afraid she might get hurt walking down her stairs <br/>\nto get the paper. If MOM would do that every day---just quietly pick up the <br/>\npaper and get back in the car, HER generosity and kindness would be an <br/>\nexample the girls would have for a lifetime. By TELLING the older daughter to <br/>\ndo it, she was telling the girls that THEIR feelings weren&#39;t as important to <br/>\nMOM as the little old lady&#39;s or the mom&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had NEVER even CONSIDERED this! <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a month or two later, she came up to me and thanked me and said that <br/>\nthat&#39;s what she had finally done. That the younger daughter (8?) had started <br/>\ntrying to BEAT her to the paper. (The neighbor had gotten a few laughs at <br/>\ntheir expense but was delighted.) The teen had once or twice gotten out on <br/>\nher OWN to help out when she was the only one capable (others sick or <br/>\nwhatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nForcing good behavior MAY result in good behavior.

I don&#39;t want to have to ask all the time,<br/>\nbecause when I do then the responsibility for doing things is still on my<br/>\nshoulders.  Which maybe it should be, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I am rambling on, I am realizing that part of this whole dilemna is<br/>\ncoming from the difficulties I have in asking my husband to help.  He gets<br/>\nmad when I ask, and very quickly accuses me of nagging.  It is a little<br/>\nbetter than it used to be, but I am also very conscious of what I ask him to<br/>\ndo.  I never ask him to pick up after himself etc. because I just get yelled<br/>\nat.  Of course, that all goes back to his childhood with an abusive parent<br/>\nwho yelled all the time and ws physically abusive.  He has come such a long<br/>\nway from there, and I know that.  But the remnants still affect our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am looking for a way to help my children see a need and respond to it,<br/>\nwhether or not someone asks them to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do know about this, is that my previous method hasn&#39;t helped very<br/>\nmuch.  I often have suggested that they help someone do something when we<br/>\nare with a group.  My son, especially, often responds quite negatively to<br/>\nthis request.  I have then sometimes told him that he had to, and other<br/>\ntimes told him to forget it (but probably not with the best attitude on my<br/>\npart).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill trying to learn here, thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nmany blessings,<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56314,"nextTopicId":56064}}
