About half an hour agoI headed outside to clean the van. The kids brought out scooters and bikes, and I asked Sarah to help me take the seats out. Other than that, I did all the shoveling LOL. Well, I asked Logan if he&#39;d go get the vacuum for me and he said &quot;Sure, as long as I can vacuum the van!&quot; I ended up actually bringing out the vacuum cleaner (he got distracted) but as soon as he saw it he said &quot;Ok, cool! I&#39;m ready to vacuum!&quot; and that&#39;s what he&#39;s busy doing right now. Gracie wanted to come inside for a minute so while we&#39;re inside I thought I&#39;d set this out there as another example of how willing to help kids can be when they don&#39;t have to help!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Beth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSing, Dance, Laugh...LOVE!<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
