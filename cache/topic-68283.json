Can&#39;t be done<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with this!  I tell my kids I love them all the time, or so I <br/>\nthought.  The other day my almost 5 year old son wandered off in Target and I <br/>\nhad to get help finding him.  My almost 4 daughter and I were really scared.  <br/>\nHe was fine, playing with the wedding registry computer by the door.  When we <br/>\ngot to the car I asked him what he thought I should do - I was pretty upset, <br/>\nfrightened, frustrated, but not yelling (thankfully) - to make sure he <br/>\nlistens to my warnings about staying close to me.  He was quiet for a while <br/>\nand then said softly &quot;You could love me more.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I don&#39;t think he believes I don&#39;t love him.  But I think he has a hard <br/>\ntime understanding that I can love him and not be happy about what he is <br/>\ndoing.  I had really helped me, and helped our relationship, that he said <br/>\nthat to me.  I&#39;m so glad I asked!  I have been really listening to the words <br/>\nI choose when I speak to him and trying to put them through his filter.  <br/>\nTrying to understand where he is coming from to get at why he does what he <br/>\ndoes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, now I&#39;m not sure my story has much to do with the original post, but I <br/>\nwanted to share.  I need to breathe and listen more.
