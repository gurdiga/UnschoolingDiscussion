The English Civil Wars","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-108465071\">A poem by the great English poet and dramatist James Shirley (1596-1666).<br/>\nThe 17th century was a particularly bloody one in Europe.  The English Civil<br/>\nWars took place between 1642 and 1651.  In Central Europe, the Thirty Years<br/>\nWar took place from 1618-1648.  Surely the poets and playwrights of that era<br/>\npondered deeply the questions of existence, the transitory nature of wealth,<br/>\nand power, of life itself.  The following poem touches on those themes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath the Leveller<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE glories of our blood and state<br/>\n  Are shadows, not substantial things;<br/>\nThere is no armour against Fate;<br/>\n  Death lays his icy hand on kings:<br/>\n        Sceptre and Crown    5<br/>\n        Must tumble down,<br/>\n  And in the dust be equal made<br/>\nWith the poor crookï¿½d scythe and spade.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome men with swords may reap the field,<br/>\n  And plant fresh laurels where they kill:   10<br/>\nBut their strong nerves at last must yield;<br/>\n  They tame but one another still:<br/>\n        Early or late<br/>\n        They stoop to fate,<br/>\nAnd must give up their murmuring breath   15<br/>\nWhen they, pale captives, creep to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe garlands wither on your brow,<br/>\n  Then boast no more your mighty deeds!<br/>\nUpon Death&#39;s purple altar now<br/>\n  See where the victor-victim bleeds.   20<br/>\n        Your heads must come<br/>\n        To the cold tomb:<br/>\nOnly the actions of the just<br/>\nSmell sweet and blossom in their dust.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nQuiller-Couch, Arthur, ed. 1919.
