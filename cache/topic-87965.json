Over 5 days, he did *nothing* but go <br/>\nto 3 New Year&#39;s Eve parties, go to a 12 hour interactive military strategy <br/>\ncomputer game party, devour a 300 page science fiction book called _Ender&#39;s <br/>\nGame_, all interespersed with constant D&D playing to fill in whatever cracks were <br/>\nleft after eating and sleeping a couple of hours a night wherever he and his <br/>\nfriends happened to collapse.  That&#39;s one heckuva wonderful, long holiday <br/>\nweekend for a 15 year old.  (Ah, for the days when I had that much energy!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn his way home last night from this awesome weekend, all he could talk about <br/>\nwas the military strategy he&#39;d been struck by in the novel he&#39;d read, and how <br/>\nhe&#39;d found ways to apply what he&#39;d learned there to the computer strategy <br/>\ngame he&#39;d played.  He was fascinated, and insisted that I needed to read the <br/>\nbook, too.  I&#39;m not a fan of science fiction, but he was so enthused -- how could <br/>\nI say no?  So, I began reading it right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the author&#39;s introduction, I found repeated references to Bruce Catton&#39;s <br/>\nCivil War trilogy _The Army of the Potomac_, which apparently had had quite <br/>\nsome impact on the writer.  I happened to have the trilogy in my library, so <br/>\nwhile Liam was taking a shower, I *strewed* the books in front of his computer.  <br/>\nSoon, he was out, all excited, wondering where in the world I&#39;d gotten these?  <br/>\nI&#39;ve had them since I was your age, I explained.  Round eyed wonder.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe began to read the first book before going to sleep.  (This being a boy who <br/>\nwas terribly damaged by ps, who has been actively deschooling in one way or <br/>\nanother for over 2 years, and who steadfastly refuses to read for information <br/>\n-- as opposed to reading for pleasure.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, we were headed off to an activity, and he bubbled all the way <br/>\nabout military strategy again, wishing that Catton&#39;s book had diagrams of the <br/>\nbattles depicted.  I offered to stop at the used bookstore on the way home to <br/>\nlook through their extensive military history section.  Cool!  (This from a boy <br/>\nwho hates, still, to go to the library, and spends his time at the bookstore <br/>\nlooking at graphic novels, comic books, and gaming manuals.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, shop we did.  And hit the jackpot.  A book of the history of US land <br/>\nbattles from the Civil War to the Gulf War, complete with diagrams, and a copy of <br/>\nSun Tzu&#39;s _The Art of War_, a centuries-old Chinese classic on military <br/>\nstrategy and philosophy that is still taught at West Point today.

Over 5 days, he did *nothing* but go <br/>\nto 3 New Year&#39;s Eve parties, go to a 12 hour interactive military strategy <br/>\ncomputer game party, devour a 300 page science fiction book called _Ender&#39;s <br/>\nGame_, all interespersed with constant D&D playing to fill in whatever cracks were <br/>\nleft after eating and sleeping a couple of hours a night wherever he and his <br/>\nfriends happened to collapse.  That&#39;s one heckuva wonderful, long holiday <br/>\nweekend for a 15 year old.  (Ah, for the days when I had that much energy!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn his way home last night from this awesome weekend, all he could talk about <br/>\nwas the military strategy he&#39;d been struck by in the novel he&#39;d read, and how <br/>\nhe&#39;d found ways to apply what he&#39;d learned there to the computer strategy <br/>\ngame he&#39;d played.  He was fascinated, and insisted that I needed to read the <br/>\nbook, too.  I&#39;m not a fan of science fiction, but he was so enthused -- how could <br/>\nI say no?  So, I began reading it right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the author&#39;s introduction, I found repeated references to Bruce Catton&#39;s <br/>\nCivil War trilogy _The Army of the Potomac_, which apparently had had quite <br/>\nsome impact on the writer.  I happened to have the trilogy in my library, so <br/>\nwhile Liam was taking a shower, I *strewed* the books in front of his computer.  <br/>\nSoon, he was out, all excited, wondering where in the world I&#39;d gotten these?  <br/>\nI&#39;ve had them since I was your age, I explained.  Round eyed wonder.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe began to read the first book before going to sleep.  (This being a boy who <br/>\nwas terribly damaged by ps, who has been actively deschooling in one way or <br/>\nanother for over 2 years, and who steadfastly refuses to read for information <br/>\n-- as opposed to reading for pleasure.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, we were headed off to an activity, and he bubbled all the way <br/>\nabout military strategy again, wishing that Catton&#39;s book had diagrams of the <br/>\nbattles depicted.  I offered to stop at the used bookstore on the way home to <br/>\nlook through their extensive military history section.  Cool!  (This from a boy <br/>\nwho hates, still, to go to the library, and spends his time at the bookstore <br/>\nlooking at graphic novels, comic books, and gaming manuals.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, shop we did.  And hit the jackpot.  A book of the history of US land <br/>\nbattles from the Civil War to the Gulf War, complete with diagrams, and a copy of <br/>\nSun Tzu&#39;s _The Art of War_, a centuries-old Chinese classic on military <br/>\nstrategy and philosophy that is still taught at West Point today.  Liam was walking <br/>\non air as we left the store, and read snatches of Sun&#39;s book to me on the way <br/>\nhome.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also borught up an old idea we&#39;ve tossed around before about taking a <br/>\ndriving tour of Civil War battlefields, now expressing that he wanted to walk the <br/>\ndiagrams in the battle book.  Accordingly, when I got on the computer at home <br/>\nI found him some links and forwarded them.  He&#39;s already working on a dream <br/>\nsheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe?  I&#39;m absolutely dizzy.  From a science fiction novel to a computer <br/>\nstrategy game to a Civil War history classic to books on military strategy and <br/>\nphilosophy, to plans for a vacation to Civil War battlefields.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a trip!  Today...and to come.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Have I told y&#39;all lately how much I love unschooling?)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87697,"nextTopicId":88508}}
