It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; so hard to think of what to say to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  i can relate and understand this.  it sounds like a touchy <br/>\nsituation that requires careful thought.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But it isn&#39;t just that. Our local h/s group seems to have developed<br/>\n&gt; in a very inclusive manner. Too inclusive IMO. It is generally<br/>\n&gt; accepted in the group that every family has the right to parent and<br/>\n&gt; homeschool in the manner in which they believe to be right for their<br/>\n&gt; family. People get very irrate if someone tells their child not to<br/>\n&gt; do something.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  their choice of methods for parenting and homeshooling are one <br/>\nthing - anyone&#39;s kids being allowed to become physically aggressive <br/>\nwith other kids and/or adults is another.  If two children at the <br/>\ngroup ended up in a full blown knock down fight, would everyone just <br/>\nstand around and watch if the parents were of the mindset that they <br/>\nshould be allowed to fight it out as a lesson?  what if one of the <br/>\nkids drew a knife out of nowhere (or worse yet, the unspeakable!), <br/>\nwhat then?   why should &quot;one hit on the head&quot;  done in an obviously <br/>\naggressive manner be any different?   being inclusive and respectful <br/>\nof everyone&#39;s parenting or homeschooling methods should not mean that <br/>\nanyone (or their kids) should have to endure physical attacks of <br/>\naggression - i&#39;m sorry....  spirited, gifted, ADD...  that is no <br/>\nlonger the issue here.  the issue is that this aggressive behavior is <br/>\nnot only being tolerated at someone else&#39;s expense, but by allowing <br/>\nit, it is encouraging the fact that it&#39;s okay to treat others this <br/>\nway and a means to get your own way!  this is not right IMO under any <br/>\ncircumstances!  <br/>\n<br/>\n   it&#39;s nice that the group is inclusive of all parenting and <br/>\nhomeschooling styles but i think it does need a couple &quot;house rules&quot; <br/>\nthat everyone should have to abide by.  how each parent enforces <br/>\nthose rules with thier children is where the everyone else&#39;s respect<br/>\nof the choice of that parent&#39;s style comes into play.  <br/>\n<br/>\n One family even got indignant because the church from<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; whom we were hiring a building said that children were not to play<br/>\n&gt; in the carpark area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know, I know. We should just stop going. But my kids have friends<br/>\n&gt; there and the physical space is just great and we live 45 minutes<br/>\n&gt; drive away and just can&#39;t get into organising something else....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  no, why should your family be impositioned or deprived of utilizing <br/>\nthe benefits of a group because some kids are being allowed to be <br/>\nphysical and hurt others?  I used to take Sterling to a playgroup at <br/>\nthe local gymnastics center.  it&#39;s intent was to give the kids safe <br/>\nequipment and area to play in, to learn their social skills when <br/>\nplaying with other kids, and to give parents the environment to be <br/>\nable to teach their kids these things.  the playgroup was for 2-6 yo. <br/>\nthe rules were simple - no running, no physical contact (hitting, <br/>\npushing, shoving), parents were to be with their kids at all times, <br/>\nparents would ensure their kids were following the rules (no matter <br/>\nwhat parenting style they chose to use to enforce them).  yes, kids <br/>\nwould occasionally be caught hitting another, but the parent was <br/>\nexpected to step in and &quot;teach&quot; their child that it is not <br/>\nappropriate and use whatever method they chose to try and ensure that <br/>\nit would not happen again.  There was a monitor present at all times <br/>\nand everyone knew that if a child continually broke the rules and the <br/>\nparent was not doing anything about it, that the monitor could <br/>\nintervene and they could also be asked to leave if the parent did not <br/>\nwant to participate in keeping the group enjoyable for everyone by <br/>\ncontrolling their child.  With everyone knowing these expectations, <br/>\nit was a fun place for the kids to go.  but kids will be kids and i <br/>\nthink every single child at some time or another lashed out <br/>\ninappropriately.  however, it was dealt with immediately because of <br/>\nthe rules that were in place and everyone was able to get past it <br/>\nquickly, put it behind, and enjoy the rest of the session.  in a <br/>\nnutshell, learning to treat others the way you want to be treated and <br/>\nmaking sure no one gets physically hurt and having fun, was the basis <br/>\nof the group.<br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps this is the philosophy that needs to be adopted by the group <br/>\nand implementing any rules necessary for that philosophy to <br/>\nmaterialize.  after all, isn&#39;t part of homeschooling teaching values <br/>\nand respect for others?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Excuses, excuses. I should just front up to these people, but there<br/>\n&gt; are enough that believe that the family has sole right of control /<br/>\n&gt; lack of control that I would just make enemies and change nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  i have a question about the group.  what is it&#39;s purpose?  is it a <br/>\nmeeting to discuss homeschooling issues?  is it a social setting for <br/>\nkids to play?  is it a learning session for kids to get together and <br/>\nhelp each other academically? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So until we can escape the situation altogether, I just make sure I<br/>\n&gt; keep close enough to intervene.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Go on.

I know parents who are respectfully parenting<br/>\ntheir spirited children. But some only respect the child, not other people. One<br/>\nfamily in particular are not even attempting, it would seem, to teach their<br/>\ngifted, spirited child that other people deserve repect also. When I say I was<br/>\nattacked, I mean it. I was sitting on the floor at our homeschool family playday<br/>\ntalking to a friend and her 5yo daughter, and this 9 yo came up and literally hit<br/>\nme on the head and started telling (yelling) me something. When I said to him &#39;I<br/>\nwas listening to Shelley, and I&#39;d like it if you would wait till she&#39;s finished,<br/>\nand also I don&#39;t like being hit on the head because it hurts&#39; he said - &#39;but I<br/>\nwant to tell you something&#39; and continued to tell (yell) me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is NOT an isolated incident. This child is severely gifted in the traditional<br/>\nareas. He has been tested and told the results. He has been heard on several<br/>\noccasions to say to kids he&#39;s trying to play with &#39;you have to play my way,<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m gifted and I so know better than you what to do&#39;. His sister was very<br/>\nmuch the same, but is finally learning, the hard way, at 12, that if she wants to<br/>\nhave friends she has to change her ways. I know a couple of other families with<br/>\nsimilarly behaved children, though this would be the worst. They are so proud of<br/>\ntheir children&#39;s abilities - and these are, I agree, unusually intelligent kids -<br/>\nbut somehow, having discovered that the &#39;spirited&#39; behaviour is common among<br/>\ngifted children, they seem to feel that the behaviour is acceptable, and must be<br/>\naccepted by everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe saddest thing of all: This child&#39;s mother sat and told me in all seriousness<br/>\nhow cruel and unwelcoming the other children were to her kids, and how sad they<br/>\nwere that no-one would play with them. When my Jeff came to her once and asked her<br/>\nto do something because her son kept breaking Jeff&#39;s construction, her response<br/>\nwas &#39;well tell him you don&#39;t like it&#39;. Jeff said he had and that the boy had<br/>\ncontinued - she did nothing. He physically manhandles the children who try to<br/>\nbefriend him, and his response to any request to modify his behaviour in any way<br/>\nis to look at the person with a look of disdain and to reply &#39;but that&#39;s what I<br/>\nwant&#39;. The daughter also used to tell other children that what they were doing was<br/>\nuseless, that she knew better. Both scream / used to scream at the tops of their<br/>\nvoices for their mother to make the other children do as they want them to do -<br/>\nfor up to half an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese and a couple of other children seem to have only one volume - full on - and<br/>\nare extremely disruptive. The parents are caring, loving, intelligent people. I<br/>\ncan only assume that they are suffering so badly from shell shock that they just<br/>\ndon&#39;t see how unpleasant their children are to others. Furthermore, they use the<br/>\nchild&#39;s intelligence to excuse the behaviour, and seem to expect the rest of us to<br/>\nsit by while their little precious trys (literally in one case) to strangle our<br/>\nkids. Say what? Yes, I believe in respectful parenting, but I also believe in<br/>\nrespecting other people in society too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend with a child that almost anyone would describe as ADHD. For a long<br/>\ntime she used to leave her son with her husband or parents when she visited<br/>\nfriends - except me. She said I was the only friend who would accept her son&#39;s<br/>\nbehaviour as something he couldn&#39;t help, so she brought him to our house. Why?<br/>\nBecause when he infringed on other people&#39;s freedoms she intervened. And that&#39;s<br/>\nthe crux of the matter. I can accept the child: I can&#39;t accept a family where the<br/>\nparent allows the child to disturb / annoy / physically hurt / emotionally harm<br/>\nothers without any intervention, because &#39;it&#39;s just the way he is / he can&#39;t help<br/>\nit / it&#39;s just part of his giftedness / he&#39;s spirited / he&#39;s got to be free to<br/>\nexpress himself....&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am saying is, spirited is great.

Neither gifted or <br/>\nspirited should be an excuse for rude, unrespectful, unruly behavior. <br/>\n I know a lot of parents with spirited kids that would agree <br/>\nand are working very hard to teach their children about their <br/>\nspiritedness and how to manage their behavior in a positive manner.  <br/>\nThis includes recognizing when they are becoming overwhelmed by too <br/>\nmuch stimulii and ways to tone themselves back down before they get <br/>\nentirely out of control, respect for other&#39;s feelings and space, and <br/>\nso on.  it&#39;s an exhausting job but equally has it&#39;s rewards.    <br/>\n<br/>\n I can accept the child: I can&#39;t accept a family<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; where the parent allows the child to disturb / annoy / physically<br/>\n&gt; hurt / emotionally harm others without any intervention, because<br/>\n&gt; &#39;it&#39;s just the way he is / he can&#39;t help it / it&#39;s just part of his<br/>\n&gt; giftedness / he&#39;s spirited / he&#39;s got to be free to express<br/>\n&gt; himself....&#39;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Perhaps if you listen carefully you might detect an underlying <br/>\nreason of why she&#39;s making excuses?  Is she on the internet?  maybe <br/>\nsuggest she join a discussion group such as this one but for parents of <br/>\nspirited kids?  You could send her over to mine for starters.  there <br/>\nare more and more surfacing all the time if someone would to spend <br/>\nsome time searching the net.  see my signature line at the bottom for <br/>\nmine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess what I am saying is, spirited is great.

Sterling is spirited and i would not (or <br/>\nlet anyone else) break that spirit but i work with him constantly to <br/>\nhelp him recognize it for the gift that it is and the good it can <br/>\nbring him.  i won&#39;t tolerate for him to use his persistance to bully <br/>\nhis way around into getting what he wants.
