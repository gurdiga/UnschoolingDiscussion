DS was skeptical at first about donating his toddler toys and<br/>\nbooks, but it didn&#39;t take long before he was letting go of a lot of things.<br/>\nI think it helped to see the adults clearing out a lot of things as well.<br/>\nThat is how DH and I spent most of the day today: we put together about 16<br/>\nbags of kid&#39;s clothing and small toys and my old clothing for charity. We<br/>\nhad already found homes for larger toys, and the library got the books and<br/>\nvideos. Tomorrow it&#39;s on to the closets! I just don&#39;t know how we have<br/>\naccumulated so much stuff over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 21<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Fri, 26 Nov 1999 17:56:32 -0800<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: CNN - Ready, set, shop! - November 26, 1999<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This website has a pamphlet with ideas for &quot;simplifying the holiday&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newdream.org\">http://www.newdream.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks, this was a useful site to visit! There was an article there about<br/>\nschools and commercialism that reminded me of ds&#39;s Kindergarten year last<br/>\nyear. At every event, parent night or holiday concert, the kids stood at<br/>\nthe entrance to the classrooms handing out little bags of assorted coupons<br/>\nand samples of household products. I was amazed and appalled. And they<br/>\nalways pushed the boxtops for education campaign also, so the kids were<br/>\nlooking for these cereals in the stores. Talk about indoctrinating future<br/>\nconsumers! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOlivia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4881,"nextTopicId":4887}}
