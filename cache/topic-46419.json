My <br/>\neldest son was in a coopertive school which I really loved but only <br/>\nwent up to kindergarten and now he is in a public school, which seems <br/>\nto have altered his great personality and learning, he thinks the <br/>\nschools curriculum is to easy and therefore I am afraid he will fall <br/>\nbehind in his studies. I have always wanted to homeschool but have no <br/>\nidea where to start and he seems to be into the idea of homeschooling <br/>\nsince he can further his intrest more then in a public school where <br/>\nthey have scheduled bathroom time and laughing.
