I can see how it <br/>\nmight have happened. And I don&#39;t think leaving a 10 year old is necessarily <br/>\nbad. Lelia was left alone (when she wanted to stay home and I had to go out) <br/>\nwhen she was 10, and probably younger as well. She is also very mature. She <br/>\nis 12 now and sits home with our two year old. Also, there were neighbors she <br/>\nknew she could count on if something came up. . . she always had an option. <br/>\nMaybe you could be the option for these kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand you being upset  . . it obviously pushes  your buttons on this <br/>\nissue. But I think jumping to conclusions that may not be the truth could  <br/>\nharm things more than help. Everyone has different ways of raising children. <br/>\nI know the door locked was not a good thing, but it really could have just <br/>\nbeen a mistake. The young people staying by themselves at times is not on the <br/>\nsurface child neglect. Of course, these are my own feelings. . . you have to <br/>\ndo what you feel if right, but since you posted, I thought I would give my <br/>\nown thoughts to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27563,"nextTopicId":27571}}
