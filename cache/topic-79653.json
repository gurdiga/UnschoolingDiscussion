It&#39;s just a bit <br/>\n&gt; overwhelming.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Judie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Judie, trust me...if anyone thought you were a bad parent or didn&#39;t really <br/>\nwant to figure out a way to help you help your sons, no one here would bother. <br/>\nIt&#39;s because it seems like you really want to find a way to help him that <br/>\npeople are responding to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I understand your frustration. $500 is a lot of money. But from what <br/>\nyou&#39;ve said, he&#39;s been pretty responsible so far in his life, with good <br/>\nfollow-through. Already that&#39;s remarkable for a still-young kid. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you might need to do is to sit down calmly, alone, and figure out what <br/>\nyour real goal is. Is it not to &quot;waste&quot; this money, or to find out what your <br/>\nchild needs and wants. (I already know the answer, but I also know that $500 is <br/>\nsticking in your craw!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that I read in your posts is that maybe you had a lot of <br/>\ndeprivation as a child. You seem to be very afraid of wasting anything, even food <br/>\nyou don&#39;t really want. It sounds like maybe you need some care and nurturing <br/>\nyourself.  I think unschooling might be really good and wonderful for YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\n{{{Judie}}}<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79631,"nextTopicId":79642}}
