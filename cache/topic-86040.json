My children are growing <br/>\nup treated like people.  Young people, but the people they are and not &quot;people <br/>\nthey will become.&quot;  They&#39;re not &quot;teens&quot; in any hard-and-fast way.   Marty <br/>\nDodd is fourteen years old right now.  He&#39;s been raised with as much freedom as <br/>\nhe could have and still be safely where he wants to be since he was born.  He <br/>\nhave not pushed him away, and we haven&#39;t prevented his venturing out.  The same <br/>\nway when he was learning to walk we let him walk away a bit if he wanted to <br/>\nand he came back every time, we let him go out away from the house a bit if he <br/>\nwants to and he comes back every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe principle hasn&#39;t changed a bit.  The range and mobility have, but his <br/>\ndesire to live in the  peace and warmth and security to which he has become <br/>\naccustomed have not changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She . . .and doesn&#39;t care for . . . the company. . .of most<br/>\n<br/>\npeople her age.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids&#39; social lives involve people younger and older.  Kirby&#39;s range is <br/>\n13-30 these days. Kirby is 17.  Marty&#39;s 13-21 (his oldest regular friend is off <br/>\nat college in another town, but when he&#39;s home they play games for hours; <br/>\nMarty&#39;s 14), and Holly (12) has friends from six to 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut because I&#39;m around kids their age (and other ages) many of whom are <br/>\nhomeschooled too and others of whom are in school, I DO have a current perspective <br/>\non the differences and in the advantages of homeschooling. Some of those <br/>\nothers who were traditionally schooled wouldn&#39;t be in such mixed-age social <br/>\nsituations if they hadn&#39;t started hanging around with my kids.  They like it.  Some <br/>\nof them have a hard time at first not dismissing the younger people, but they <br/>\neither change or wander off, usually.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never heard anyone claim unschooling is &quot;bulletproof&quot; so once again a <br/>\ndetractor is bringing up a previously unheard argument.  That&#39;s called &quot;a straw <br/>\nman,&quot; and I really don&#39;t like it as a rhetorical device on this list.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf unschooling isn&#39;t better or best, let&#39;s disband the group and go and do <br/>\nwhat we think IS best.   If I didn&#39;t think unschooling wasn&#39;t a better situation <br/>\nthan my freely-available alternatives, I wouldn&#39;t be doing it myself and sure <br/>\nas hell wouldn&#39;t be spending this much energy helping others do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling Better, Even Best -- But Not BulletProof","postDate":"1071164781","msgId":86077,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1MS4yODA5M2ViOC4yZDBhMDc2ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86072,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":86076,"nextInTime":86078,"topicId":86040,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/10/03 8:35:56 PM, jnjstau@gvtc.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2057819414\">In a message dated 12/10/03 8:35:56 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   Unschooled teens live in reality with everybody else.
