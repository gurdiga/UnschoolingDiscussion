If you should decided to head down through CA from the Oregon end,<br/>\ntake 101.  A must stop is a wide spot in the road called Orick.  Roosevelt<br/>\nElk have the right of way on the freeway (well, so it is a nice two lane<br/>\nhighway, it is still called a freeway &lt;g&gt;) and they are always grazing by<br/>\nthe side of the road.  A right towards the ocean brings you out at Fern<br/>\nCanyon where Lost World was filmed.  About 45 miles south you will come to<br/>\nTrinidad and Patrick&#39;s Point State Park (btw, you can buy a year&#39;s pass and<br/>\nstay in all the state parks free after the initial fee) where there is an<br/>\nauthentic Native American village built by Native Americans (not teepees!)<br/>\nand Agate Beach.  Further down the coast you come to Eureka where you will<br/>\nfind the Carson Mansion, the most photographed single family residence<br/>\n(castles don&#39;t get into this category) in the world.  The next side trip<br/>\nyou want to take is to Ferndale, &quot;The Victorian Village, site of many<br/>\nmovies including &quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Salem&#39;s Lot.&quot;  Continue south to the<br/>\nturnoff at Pepperwood which is the old highway.  There are several camping<br/>\nspaces along this 100 mile stretch.  The tallest and oldest trees are found<br/>\nhere--Coastal redwoods, many of them over 300&#39; tall.  You drive right<br/>\nbetween them on a road that was contructed to their needs so it is rather<br/>\nsquiggly, as the kidlets put it but not too bad as it is a regular on the<br/>\nmotorhome route.  You can see the Grandfather Tree which stands at almost<br/>\n300&#39;.  It has survived a lightning strike, 64&#39; flood waters, human&#39;s<br/>\nattempting to cut it down and a fire.  In each and every one of the<br/>\npull-offs and parks in this National Forest if you sit quietly jays and<br/>\nchipmunks will come right up to the kids and you can see river otters and<br/>\ndeer within 10 to 20 feet of you.  You could also take a side trip to<br/>\nShelter Cove, also known as the Lost Coast and home of the black sand<br/>\nbeaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen onward in a southerly direction through Mendocino County.  You might<br/>\nwant to take a side trip to Fort Ross where the Russians had a settlement. <br/>\n And then into Sonoma County (wineries by the dozens if you like) and in<br/>\nPetaluma is Vallejo&#39;s fort and in the city of Sonoma (a left off of 101 to<br/>\nthe east) is Vallejo&#39;s home.

(About 20 minutes from Trenton)Albert <br/>\nEinstein lived there.  They shot the film I.Q. there.  You can tour <br/>\nPrinceton University campus.  Their library is famous and they have a great <br/>\nart museum which is open to the public.  It is also home to black squirrels <br/>\nwhich aren&#39;t found anywhere else in the U.S.  They were imported from <br/>\nEngland because the University was based on Cambridge U and they had black <br/>\nsquirrels on campus (they are also very friendly as they are used to being <br/>\naround people).  Also, a lot of history in Princeton (an old grave yard, <br/>\nhomes, etc.)  Also home to Princeton Theological Seminary school (right next <br/>\nto the University) The Annex is a must eat at place, it is in a basement, <br/>\nbut has been around a very long time and they have pictures on the walls of <br/>\nall of the famous and historical people who have dined there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I know that is a novel and we are still trying to think if there is <br/>\nanything else.  Of course, Philadelphia is filled with historical stops <br/>\n((Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Elfreth&#39;s Alley (old cobblestone street <br/>\nwith original houses, can tour them))  I could probably go on forever, so I <br/>\nwon&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and I wish we were going with you.
