We have a website; www.coyotescorner.com<br/>\n which we&#39;re rebuilding. We work powwows and we are working on establishing a wholesale company out of this. We started w/ four blankets, no car, no computer 5 years ago. Things have improved.<br/>\nBrianna works in the company w/ me and she gets paid. She&#39;s designed the tri-fold we hand out and she prints the whole thing out on the printer. She&#39;s also in charge of the oils and other aromatherapy items.<br/>\nShe has chosen this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur next website is the Frugal Environmentalist....that should be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is we have to earn money - if we&#39;re very lucky, we get to work at what we love.
