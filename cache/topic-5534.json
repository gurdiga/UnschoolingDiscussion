Not forcing them to be <br/>\nright-handed -- they are right-handed -- just have to remind them sometimes <br/>\nof what will feel more natural, easier, if they will try it.  Then they do <br/>\nand &quot;Oh yeah -- that&#39;s better.&quot;  So, I think that might apply to how you hold <br/>\na pen/crayon in general.  It is easier, once you get used to it, and have the <br/>\nmanual dexiterity to handle it, to hold a pencil, etc., &quot;correctly&quot; -- for a <br/>\nlot of people -- maybe not yours -- but a lot.  It produces a better product, <br/>\neasier and more naturally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH -- I see no reason why the letters or numbers have to be written in a <br/>\nparticular way -- up then down or whatever -- I am happy if the end product <br/>\nis legible and I think that is all that matters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEase of use and legibility -- this is all I want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96110,"nextTopicId":96200}}
