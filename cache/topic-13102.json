If you have any questions, <br/>\njust let me <br/>\nknow and I&#39;ll see what I can do.  Hurry - Teacher Registration is <br/>\nopen until <br/>\nSeptember 22!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda in FL :)<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************************************<br/>\nFoundation for Online Learning<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are invited to visit The Foundation for Online Learning at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netcollege.org/instructor/fol.\">http://www.netcollege.org/instructor/fol.</a> We are a fairly new <br/>\norganization <br/>\ncreated <br/>\nby home educators and we have had wonderful responses from people who <br/>\nhave joined us. The best part of FOL is that there are absolutely no <br/>\nfees <br/>\ninvolved in taking our courses. The only cost to you is your time! <br/>\nThe classes are free of charge.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur organization is a safe cooperative learning environment on the <br/>\nweb for<br/>\nfolks who enjoy teaching children. The majority of the participants in<br/>\nthese classes are home educators. We have a few teachers who are not <br/>\nhome<br/>\neducators, but they willingly extend their abilities as teachers <br/>\nwithin our<br/>\ngroup. The idea is for a parent/teacher to choose a topic that they <br/>\nwould <br/>\nlike <br/>\nto teach, and then teach the course using the Internet method of <br/>\ntheir choice<br/>\n(i.e., BBS, Email, ListServ, Website, Chatrooms, etc.). We will help <br/>\ntrain<br/>\nand/or give guidance on how to effectively use these methods of <br/>\nteaching,<br/>\nbut the teacher has the freedom to choose their own course topic and<br/>\nteaching method. We will give suggestions and mini-training courses <br/>\nfor any<br/>\nteacher who would like to learn more about how to use the Internet to <br/>\nteach<br/>\na course.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the appropriate time, you will be asked to submit a teacher bio <br/>\nform,<br/>\ngiving general information about yourself. Next, you will fill out a<br/>\nteacher&#39;s registration form, giving general information about the <br/>\ncourse<br/>\nthat you will be teaching. Those bios and courses will be posted on <br/>\nthe FOL<br/>\nwebsite. We run on a semester basis. Your commitment is made one <br/>\nsemester<br/>\nat a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach semester that you would like for your children to participate in <br/>\nthe<br/>\nFoundation for Online Learning (FOL) courses, you MUST be willing to <br/>\nteach<br/>\nand complete a six week course on the subject of your choice. <br/>\nTeachers who<br/>\ndo not fulfill the requirement of completing the class they are <br/>\nteaching<br/>\nwill have their children removed from the classes in which they are<br/>\nregistered. This is a balance we must keep to make it fair for <br/>\neveryone and<br/>\nto ensure fulfillment of commitments. Emergencies are always <br/>\nconsidered. By<br/>\ndoing this, we hope to keep disappointments to a minimum.<br/>\nIf you feel unsure about this type of commitment, you can consider<br/>\nco-teaching with someone, either from the list or a friend you would <br/>\nfeel<br/>\ncomfortable sharing this arrangement with. This will allow for more<br/>\ncontinuity for your class throughout the semester. It is a great way <br/>\nto get<br/>\na feel for how this all works and have even more support between <br/>\npeople. We<br/>\nhave had several people do this and it has worked very well for them. <br/>\nBoth<br/>\nteacher&#39;s children may take classes during the semester that they are<br/>\nco-teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep teacher/parents and kids safety at a high priority. We have a<br/>\npersonal reason as well as a public reason; our kids are taking these<br/>\nclasses also! Therefore, any rude/demeaning remarks, profanity or <br/>\nanything<br/>\nsimilar toward anyone on this list is NOT PERMITTED! There are <br/>\nmoderators<br/>\nwho are actively watching this list and will handle any situations in <br/>\na way<br/>\nthat they deem appropriate. The moderators can remove anyone from <br/>\nthis list<br/>\nand/or classes, without notice, if they do not follow the rules put <br/>\nin place<br/>\nby this organization.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Foundation for Online Learning is open to all people. We are an<br/>\nINCLUSIVE group. All we ask is that our rules be followed. You are <br/>\nwelcome<br/>\nto teach from a Christian perspective, or any other religious <br/>\npreference.<br/>\nHowever, if you will be teaching a class with a tendency toward a <br/>\nspecific<br/>\nreligion/philosophy you must state this in your class description at <br/>\nthe<br/>\ntime of teacher/class registrations. Descriptions must be clear and <br/>\nconcise<br/>\nfor this purpose. By doing your part in keeping this very clear from <br/>\nthe<br/>\nbeginning, you will help prevent any misunderstandings.<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nIf you would like more information you can follow the subscribing <br/>\ndirections<br/>\nbelow.
