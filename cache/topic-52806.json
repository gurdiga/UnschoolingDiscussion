I witnessed this Monday <br/>\nnight at Toys R Us:  One mother, alone in an aisle, lets out a whistle.  <br/>\nImmediately she recieves an answering whistle from nearby.  I thought that <br/>\nwas very cool.  Sometime later, I&#39;m checking out a woman who looks around and <br/>\ncan&#39;t find her son.  She begins running around frantically, sends her younger <br/>\nson to help look for the older one, I make an announcement, the cop gets <br/>\ninvolved, dad comes in and helps look, finally the boy arrives at the <br/>\nregister, with mom scolding and asking the policeman to advise junior on the <br/>\ndangers of not staying with mom.<br/>\n  As for me personally, I&#39;d have the young child(ren) stay in a cart if I had <br/>\nshopping to do.  I usually pick up something (or bring a favorite) to keep my <br/>\nson occupied while I shop.  If he&#39;s getting antsy, I may need to cut the trip <br/>\nshort.  Other times are for leisurely shopping, and my son can look all he <br/>\nwants.  Sometimes the trip is expressly so he can  stay and play with the <br/>\nThomas the train toys.  I let him know in advance which kind of trip it&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to be.<br/>\nMary J</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52805,"nextTopicId":52822}}
