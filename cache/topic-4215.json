She spends a<br/>\nconsiderable amount of time watching toddler programs that are geared for<br/>\nchildren entering the school system.  And I cringe every time they focus<br/>\non rewards and punishments and busywork and all of the things we want to<br/>\navoid by unschooling.  Franklin and Little Bear are the worst I think<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re about &quot;days in life of&quot;.  At least Sesame Street and<br/>\nTeletubbies are just about learning and not &quot;going to school&quot;.  I&#39;d love<br/>\nto hear other thoughts as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrooke in Oklahoma<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4143,"nextTopicId":4216}}
