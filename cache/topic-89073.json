I fully believe <br/>\nin unschooling theory, and I have been thrilled at how it has opened <br/>\nup my own life, made me feel lighter, free-er, just generally less <br/>\nstressed out. I am also thrilled to see my kids creating these <br/>\nwonderful lives without being held back and harmed by school, or <br/>\nschool-at-home for that matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far we haven&#39;t had any objections from the family (all friends <br/>\nsupport us, even our dear friend who is a gradeschool teacher!) but <br/>\nwe do on occasion get the quizzing. I get very grouchy about that <br/>\nand am trying to work on a better way of dealing with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s probably enough for now. Just so you know who I am when <br/>\nI start posting.
