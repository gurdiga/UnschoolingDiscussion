I frequently disagree with him, but since <br/>\nI&#39;ve always enjoyed a good debate, that&#39;s O.K. Although I enjoy many of the <br/>\nparenting type posts, I don&#39;t have much to say on that subject. My children <br/>\nare 13 and 11, and after years of playgroup and parent discussions it all is <br/>\ngetting a little old.  A few years ago I realized that I missed the more <br/>\nadult discussions I could engage in before children and before moving to a <br/>\nsmall town filled with busybodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that Sandra is probably an old friend to you, and perhaps because <br/>\nof that friendship and history, I think perhaps you can&#39;t see that she&#39;s had <br/>\nit in for Ned from the start, because she&#39;s met her match in him. She has <br/>\nsystematically attacked every thing he posts in order to get everyone up in <br/>\narms. Soon after her little war began, Joyce joined in (it seemed out of <br/>\nloyalty to Sandra). If the two of them had just stopped their own tirades <br/>\nabout his so-called ranting, and had stopped bossing everyone around, the <br/>\nwhole flow of discussions would have soon returned to normal. Although I&#39;ve <br/>\nfound her to be just as controlling and pushy in her opinions, I haven&#39;t <br/>\nsuggested banning her. I think banning should be reserved for the perverted <br/>\nand violent. But if you are going to start banning those who flood the list <br/>\nwith posts of their own agendas and opinions, then perhaps she should be put <br/>\non a forced posting holiday as well. And after her, perhaps Joyce could have <br/>\na little leave of absence as moderator, and after her perhaps Tia or Mary? <br/>\nOnce you start banning people based on some vague sort of popularity contest, <br/>\nyou are heading down a very slippery slope.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp until now I have been happy to think you were very cool headed and <br/>\nobjective about these stupid squabbles.
