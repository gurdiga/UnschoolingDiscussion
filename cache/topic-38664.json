Our neighbors <br/>\n(across the street) last name is Trujillo. I cannot stand the Trujillo <br/>\nfamily. I could make a list numbering in the thousands why I can&#39;t stand <br/>\nthem. Lets just say it started one early morning soon after they moved in, <br/>\nwhen I went out and found their 12 y.o. daughter wailing away on her 6 y.o. <br/>\nbrother. He was screaming so loud our very deaf 92 y.o. next door neighbor <br/>\nwas outside shaking her finger at them. I made the mistake of intervening and <br/>\nasking the girl why she felt the need to beat up her little brother. She <br/>\ninformed me the little S$*% had left his library book inside and she was <br/>\ntrying to get him to go on to school, because she was not going to unlock the <br/>\ndoor. I told her it would have taken less time to unlock the door for him, <br/>\nand they could have already been on their way. Then I told her to open the <br/>\ndoor for him and told him to get his book, wash his face with cool water and <br/>\nif he wanted he could go to school with Jack. So off to school he went with <br/>\nJack, his book and a tear stained face, scrubbed not so nicely by his sister. <br/>\n(Who went on without him.) About an hour later I answered a knock at my door. <br/>\nHis mother told me to never interfere with her children again, that the girl <br/>\nwas in charge when she and their father were at work and if she felt the need <br/>\nto discipline her little brother than it wasn&#39;t for me to stop her. AND that <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t appreciate having to come home to tell me this after receiving a <br/>\nphone call from the daughter at school. Now I get glares from the mother, and <br/>\nthe daughter flips me off. My kids aren&#39;t allowed to play with their kids, <br/>\nand the little boy is always calling to my son across the street to see if he <br/>\ncan come over, when he knows his mom wouldn&#39;t let him if the world was <br/>\nending. Poor thing, he knows it isn&#39;t like it here like it is at his home and <br/>\nI can hear in his voice he wants so badly to play in peace. It just makes me <br/>\nmad, and sad for him at the same time. :o( <br/>\nIts the name, I just know it!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":101672438,"authorName":"Bill and Diane","from":"Bill and Diane &lt;cen46624@...&gt;","profile":"thegreatdiane","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschoolers as Parents","postDate":"1025294404","msgId":38723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEMUNDMDQ0Ljg4MDJFREQxQHZvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIzLjIwNWY2ZTc0LjJhNGRlMGQxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38722,"nextInTopic":38728,"prevInTime":38722,"nextInTime":38724,"topicId":38664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes that&#39;s a dumbass excuse on the part of <br/>\na bully.  But other times, and probably just as many, one child IS being <br/>\nirritating from the inability to read the first five or twenty-five &quot;please <br/>\ndon&#39;t, that bugs me&quot; clues.  Some people can&#39;t even respond appropriately to <br/>\n&quot;Please stop, I don&#39;t like that&quot; plain English.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although it IS lame to say &quot;You need to learn not to be irritating&quot; it can <br/>\nalso be truly true. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got mad at Kirby sometimes for hitting Marty when they were younger, and <br/>\nfound out later that Marty had pushed and pressed and prodded *on purpose* <br/>\nWAY past the point most people would have decked him AND tattled, knowing <br/>\nthat Kirby was pretty patient and that if and when Kirby did hit him that <br/>\nKirby would get in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I contributed to that whole dynamic without really knowing it, at first.  <br/>\nBut it never got to the point that I said &quot;Go ahead, Kirby, let him have it.&quot; <br/>\n I concentrated more on seeing what Marty was lacking and why he was getting <br/>\ninto Kirby&#39;s space with a goofball show.  And there were real reasons.  Some <br/>\nI could help with and some just needed time for Marty to get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a simple situation.  Buvise Marty to learn how to avoid being a <br/>\nworld-class irritant would have been way more unfair to both of them in the <br/>\nlongrun.  I would have been telling Marty his behavior didn&#39;t matter a bit, <br/>\nthat he  would be defended no matter how wrong he might have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting that anyone else&#39;s kid could possibly be as irritating as <br/>\nMarty was to Kirby.  I&#39;m just saying that even if it&#39;s only JUST a little <br/>\nbit, it&#39;s worth helping your child see how their own behavior contributed, if <br/>\nit did.  And while some kids are great at reading subtle signs of interest or <br/>\navoidance, others are NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a phone conversation somewhat against my will with someone just <br/>\nyesterday.  I was telling my husband this morning that I just let it go and <br/>\ngo until she was repeating herself rather than cut her off or say &quot;GEEZ, I <br/>\nknow all this, and you&#39;re an idiot.&quot;  She even managed to tell me what I <br/>\nneeded to MAKE Marty do (about submitting an SCA name change form, all <br/>\nheraldic business within a club we&#39;re in).  I told &quot;I don&#39;t make Marty do <br/>\nmuch.&quot;  And her &quot;advice&quot; was I make Marty do all the research and footwork to <br/>\nget his name changed.    No, we stuck Marty with a registered name when he <br/>\nwas born, and now that he&#39;s older he wants to choose his own name.  I will do <br/>\nthe paperwork to get that changed since I&#39;m the one who did the paperwork to <br/>\nget him named in the first place.  (He&#39;s going from Jeffery Paul Gunwaldtsson <br/>\nto Bardolf Gunwaldtsson, which is a better name anyway.

She may hit because she doesn&#39;t yet know what to<br/>\ndo with unpleasant emotions. She may hit because she doesn&#39;t have any other<br/>\nskills to respond. Punishing her for choosing the wrong technique doesn&#39;t<br/>\ngive her the right technique.

It doesn&#39;t really go far enough -- it&#39;s still<br/>\nat the core about how to get the kids to do what you want them to -- but it<br/>\nhelped me to see how the standard things that parents say have the opposite<br/>\neffect of what we want them to and to start seeing the world from the kids<br/>\nside.

Now that I have decided to homeschool my kids, I wonder what to do about a little girl 6 1/2 at our homeschooling park day who is mostly just verbally mean to my almost-5yo son. She also seems to be able to rabble-rouse otherwise nice girls to chime in with her when she yells &quot;Go away!&quot; or &quot;I hate that boy!&quot; at the poor kid. Admittedly, he is not particularly adept, socially. He will tend to go near a group of (usually) girls who are playing and he kind of stands there. I think he expects them to say, &quot;Hey, wanna play with us?&quot; I think his standing there tongue-tied sets this little girl off. Now he doesn&#39;t have to do anything and she harangues him. She calls him stupid and other names. Her mom stands by doing nothing which infuriates me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have suggested that he play with someone else, or look for one person at a time to play with. I coach him on how to approach kids he wants to play with. I think he finds it a little interesting how this mean girl is, so he tends to stick around for the punishment from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish her mom would tell her not to be so hurtful.

I certainly find myself at home with the ethical and moral assumptions of most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2017547888\">I have been reading this list for a while.  I don&#39;t know if I am an <br/>\nunschooler.  I certainly find myself at home with the ethical and moral <br/>\nassumptions of most unschoolers.  Practically speaking, it is clear that my <br/>\nown children thrive with self-directed learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hesitate, however, on these issues of parenting.  I would ask questions, <br/>\nnot about the power struggles of socks and clean rooms, but about the moral <br/>\nhabits of a child and the parent&#39;s role in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is illustrated my my experience with one of the few &quot;real&quot; <br/>\nunschoolers I have met.  We had become friends with this family, meeting <br/>\nabout once a week to hang out and play  for about 6 months.  Then we went on <br/>\nto agree that the moms would take turns taking a few hours off while all the <br/>\nother kids were with the other two moms.  Six weeks into this, it fell apart <br/>\nwhen I returned to find that while the two moms were on the porch, a big 11 <br/>\nyr old had gotten angry at the younger kids and my 7 yr old had been curled <br/>\nup in the fetal position while this older girl pummeled her with her fists.  <br/>\nFrom all accounts it was very violent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were many issues in this for me, mostly that I should have never left <br/>\nthem in the first place, but for this list I am interested in the other mom&#39;s <br/>\nresponse to her own daughter&#39;s behaviour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvidently, after the moms came in and things settled down, everyone sat in a <br/>\ncircle and each person went around and vented their feelings.  When she spoke <br/>\nto me later the mom apologized that her daughter hit my daughter, but also <br/>\nmentioned that benefit of learning not to push buttons that trigger an angry <br/>\nresponse in other people.  It was only later, in talking to my other kids  <br/>\nthat I realized how violent the scene was.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a natural consequence for this 11 yr old girl.  She and her family <br/>\nhave never been to our house again(something she was really disappointed with <br/>\nas we have a great art room).  In the subsequent months, she was sheepish and <br/>\nI guess embarassed whenever our paths crossed.  Of course, it is a <br/>\nconsequence for the whole family as well, since it is just not feasible to <br/>\narrange any play dates for the younger kids as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fault the other mom for not being more responsible and not being closer to <br/>\nstop it sooner but that is an aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy unschooling question, though, is shouldn&#39;t the parent step in sooner in <br/>\nthe life of an angry child with contrived consequences, that is &quot;punishment&quot;, <br/>\nto save the natural consequences that could follow down the road which are <br/>\nmore damaging and more permanent.  Of course, this is not to the exclusion of <br/>\nthought and dialogue and hopefully relief about the nature of the anger  or <br/>\nas an ego-type exercise for the parent with an &quot;I&#39;ll show you!&quot; attitude.  <br/>\nPerhaps a contrived consequence could cause a child not to act in a moment of <br/>\nanger giving them a few seconds to think rationally before they make mistakes <br/>\nwith increasing consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me an abdication of parental responsibility to address a harmful <br/>\nbehaviour by having everyone express their feelings and then let the <br/>\nconsequences fall as they may.  Where (or where not) is an unschooling <br/>\nphilosophy in this?  If a child is secure of the good will of a parent isn&#39;t <br/>\nis more kind   when a  5 or 6 yr old hits someone else to say, you sit here <br/>\nin this chair for this time because you did this which is not allowed, than <br/>\nto end up with an 11 yr old making tracks which will be difficult for her to <br/>\nerase later on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wondered along similar lines when someone suggested that the child who <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t stop at the signs be shown pictures or stories of dead children.  <br/>\nThat solution struck me as almost cruel compared to something like, I will <br/>\nstop at the corners because my mom says it dangerous if I don&#39;t  she won&#39;t <br/>\nallow me to have a   bike .   In the context of a healthy relationship with a <br/>\nparent, couldn&#39;t that  be ok?  (Granted the tone of that story indicated to <br/>\nme some separate issues).   Seems that part of being a parent is to be  a <br/>\nshield at least for a few short years that allows children some innocence and <br/>\nsimplicity and maybe that involves playing a bit of &quot;god&quot; in their life.  I <br/>\nam wondering. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts.  Melissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38759,"nextTopicId":38739}}
