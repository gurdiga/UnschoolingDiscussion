You start by <br/>\nchoosing either Fact or Legend.  If you choose Fact, you&#39;ll be taken <br/>\nthrough a general history of piracy from ancient times through the Roman <br/>\nyears, the middle ages, the golden years of piracy from the 1600s through <br/>\nthe 1800s and into the modern era.  I hadn&#39;t realized that Sir Francis <br/>\nDrake was actually a pirate, and I had no idea of the amount of piracy <br/>\nstill going on today.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The Types of Piracy section will clue you in to the differences between <br/>\npirates, buccaneers, privateers, and corsairs.  In the Famous Pirates <br/>\nsection you&#39;ll learn about a number of famous pirates including Edward <br/>\nTeach, Henry Morgan, Mary Read, Sir Francis Drake, and Stede Bonnet.  The <br/>\nsection on Pirate Facts will help you learn about boarding techniques, the <br/>\nJolly Roger, pirate life on land and sea, rules, and punishment.  There&#39;s <br/>\ninformation about the various types of pirate ships as well as the parts of <br/>\nthe ships, with pictures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe legend section of the site offers a list of fiction about pirates, in <br/>\nbooks, movies and poems.
