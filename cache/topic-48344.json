Of course their mom was very restrictive as to what she thought <br/>\nthey should see or not. Probably the first time they saw anything with <br/>\nsuspense in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would imagine it&#39;s scary for some kids, especially if they are prone to <br/>\nbad dreams and such. Watching it during the day, far away from bedtime I <br/>\nthink would help. Also, keeping the tone light during the movie will help <br/>\ntoo. You know, laugh and talk a lot during the scenes so the kids don&#39;t get <br/>\nall into thinking how scary it is. That&#39;s how we dealt with other kids <br/>\nwatching and possibly being scared.
