That&#39;s my working theory so far, btw, my son is  9. <br/>\n But I&#39;ve always seen adolescence as a chemical independence, it&#39;s almost <br/>\nlike the body is forcing the division between parent and child.  But for an <br/>\nunschooler, for example, that&#39;s not a shock, it&#39;s just another process and stage, <br/>\nand it&#39;s one they are well prepared to handle.  <br/>\n<br/>\n       I think my 9 year old right now is going thru one of those stages now, <br/>\na dry run of independence, a rehearsal if you will.

Some  parents don&#39;t really enjoy reading, or <br/>\ndon&#39;t really enjoy reading certain types of books but feel guilty <br/>\nabout it because society says that books are good for kids.  So they <br/>\nhave books sitting around anyway because they hope their kids will <br/>\npick them up and read them.  I used to be guilty of doing that with <br/>\ncertain kinds of children&#39;s picture books.  I didn&#39;t buy them because <br/>\nI thought my kids would like them or because I liked them, but <br/>\nbecause I thought I had to get my kids to like them because they were <br/>\ngood for them.  That is a kind of coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But if parents have books around because they delight in reading <br/>\ngood books and even buy special books that they think would delight <br/>\ntheir kids, and then their kids pick up on the idea that books are <br/>\nfun things, then it&#39;s just kids picking things up naturally from <br/>\ntheir environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150551601,"authorName":"Stepheny Cappel","from":"&quot;Stepheny Cappel&quot; &lt;stephc62@...&gt;","profile":"stephc621587","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: natural learning","postDate":"1060993456","msgId":78876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODgwMWMzNjM4YyRiYjEzOTVhMCQxMDhjZDZkMUBzdGVwaGM2Mj4=","referencesHeader":"PGJoajlrZStybGRjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78875,"nextInTopic":78879,"prevInTime":78875,"nextInTime":78877,"topicId":78742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This has become an interesting thread... a few of my thoughts here.

Somebody posted earlier the Holt dictum of &quot;if <br/>\n  there&#39;s no question, there&#39;s no teaching&quot;--so what do we call it when <br/>\n  parents takes it upon themselves to teach their children the Ten <br/>\n  Commandments or the Five Pillars before the children are mature <br/>\n  enough to seriously wonder about morality laws for themselves? Other <br/>\n  parents who fervently argue that children should have the freedom to <br/>\n  do what they want with their own free time will still think nothing <br/>\n  of requiring their children to attend church once a week. <br/>\n<br/>\n  From my atheistic viewpoint, I don&#39;t think there should be a <br/>\n  religious exception to the &quot;no coercion&quot; rule of unschooling. If a <br/>\n  mathematician who insists that his child study an arithmetic book <br/>\n  cannot be said to be truly unschooling, then neither can the theist <br/>\n  who insists that his child study a holy book. Both are equally guilty <br/>\n  in my eyes of coercing the child and meddling with his intellectual <br/>\n  freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Deniz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I don&#39;t think that was in<br/>\ndispute. The original claim (unless I&#39;ve got my posts muddled, quite<br/>\npossible) is that the occupants of this list aren&#39;t as radical as some<br/>\nunschooling list, and then the religion factor was thrown in to illustrate<br/>\nthis argument, as a point of proof.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to illustrate anything, though, about the general posting<br/>\npopulation of this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Somebody posted earlier the Holt dictum of &quot;if<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s no question, there&#39;s no teaching&quot;--so what do we call it when<br/>\n&gt; parents takes it upon themselves to teach their children the Ten<br/>\n&gt; Commandments or the Five Pillars before the children are mature<br/>\n&gt; enough to seriously wonder about morality laws for themselves?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To sound like BC, it depends on what your definition of &quot;teach&quot; is. If it&#39;s<br/>\nenforced, tested, plotted out, etc., it&#39;s not unschooling. If it&#39;s under the<br/>\nsame general style as me &quot;teaching&quot; my daughters to cook (i.e, cooking with<br/>\nthem as they express an interest in doing so) it&#39;s still unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI breed rabbits. I&#39;ve mentioned that a few thousand times in the past few<br/>\ndays, I know. Sorry. My point here is that in a household where the parents<br/>\nare animal-rights activists, breeding cute show bunnies is going to get an<br/>\nentirely different slant from the parents than it is in this household. It<br/>\nis impossible (and a bad idea) to try to hide our beliefs and ideals from<br/>\nour children. There is a large difference between living my life as I see<br/>\nfit vs. forcing my children to my every viewpoint.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Other<br/>\n&gt; parents who fervently argue that children should have the freedom to<br/>\n&gt; do what they want with their own free time will still think nothing<br/>\n&gt; of requiring their children to attend church once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I am not finding the posters in this discussion, or on this list, who<br/>\ndo this. And when someone says they DO do this, it&#39;s cause for quite a<br/>\ndebate here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From my atheistic viewpoint, I don&#39;t think there should be a<br/>\n&gt; religious exception to the &quot;no coercion&quot; rule of unschooling. If a<br/>\n&gt; mathematician who insists that his child study an arithmetic book<br/>\n&gt; cannot be said to be truly unschooling, then neither can the theist<br/>\n&gt; who insists that his child study a holy book.

When Holly fell so in love with Joseph and the.... <br/>\nDreamcoat, I read her the whole of Joseph&#39;s life from the Bible.  It&#39;s a <br/>\nreally great story.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read to them and told them things from other religions too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they asked me (each separately when he or she came to wonder) &quot;Who was <br/>\nthe first person on this planet?&quot;  I told them Adam and Eve, and evolution, and <br/>\nsaid some believe one and some believe the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;--but then <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there are other groups which will take that one step further and <br/>\n&gt; say &quot;you can&#39;t say you&#39;re unschooling except for religion&quot;, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know there are unschoolers who see it as a thing to do six hours a day 180 <br/>\ndays a year.  That&#39;s okay, but they&#39;re still dividing learning from life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not crazy about religious homeschoolers, but IF a family is thoroughly <br/>\ninvolved in religion, bigtime, how can that NOT be live as they know it?  Their <br/>\nkids WILL learn that religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were immersed in the SCA.  We didn&#39;t TELL them about the SCA, it was <br/>\njust there, all the time, with its annual rhythm, and its campouts and winter <br/>\nfeasts and costumes and alternate &quot;persona&quot; names.   As each was old enough to <br/>\nmake alternate plans, we&#39;ve never forced them to go to any SCA stuff.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ve rarely objected, though,  and lately they want to go more than we do!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m rambling, but there are realities of families.  Some race cars or breed <br/>\nrabbits.  Are they indoctrinating their children in race car lore or rabbit <br/>\nknowledge?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"natural learning","postDate":"1060963047","msgId":78844,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODE1LjA4NTczMC41MjQuMTE2MjUwQHdlYm1haWwxMC5ueWMudW50ZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78843,"nextInTopic":78847,"prevInTime":78843,"nextInTime":78845,"topicId":78742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kathryn, who s probably less radical than bizarre, despite her best efforts ANd don t forget...really, really friggin FUNNY!
