She didn&#39;t need to prove to<br/>\nanyone she believed she was doing right. She just did it. If people doubted,<br/>\nshe could give them information but their doubt was their problem to work<br/>\nthrough.

Since you have younger<br/>\nchildren in the home you might also be interested in AlwaysUnschooled at<br/>\nYahoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven a brief period of being in school can be damaging - and I&#39;m guessing<br/>\nyou saw some damage or you wouldn&#39;t have pulled your dd out. She will need<br/>\nto spend some time de-schooling (also called decompressing). Just pretend it<br/>\nis vacation for the time being, and let her relax and play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with the holidays are coming up so soon, you have the perfect excuse<br/>\nto tell your relatives that you are going to re-examine your schedule, or<br/>\nsome such vague yet true statement, after the new year. This will give you<br/>\ntime to do plenty of reading about Unschooling in the interim.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a good start try www.sandradodd.com/unschooling <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a different format, but a lot of the same wonderful writers, try<br/>\nwww.unschooling.info  Everything organized into topics.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor mindful parenting - especially of little ones - info try<br/>\nwww.naturalchild.org  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso John Holt. For relatives who still think schools are fabulous places<br/>\nfor every child, but want to learn more, try giving them some John Taylor<br/>\nGatto. <br/>\n<br/>\nI pretty much always leave dealing with his mother&#39;s negativity to my dh. He<br/>\nprefers it that way also. If you have genuine fears that your MIL would do<br/>\nsomething so disruptive to family unity as call CPS (or whatever it is<br/>\ncalled in your state) I think the first person to talk to about that might<br/>\nbe your dh. <br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the journey.
