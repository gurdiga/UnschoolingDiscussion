We&#39;re only paying $35 for the entire semester, plus <br/>\nthe $25/mo. or so that the rental costs. We couldn&#39;t even come close <br/>\nto that kind of bargain with private or semi-private lessons. Of <br/>\ncourse, I knew we couldn&#39;t expect perfection at that price but right <br/>\nnow it was this program or nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Beth<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ps(Now he wants to play the xylophone(!) so we&#39;re looking into <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; too.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If he does, I know a young marimba player who might have some <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tips.

I&#39;d love any suggestions about how to go about <br/>\nit. I&#39;ve been told that these types of instruments (meaning <br/>\nxylophones/marimbas etc.) can&#39;t be rented and therefore lessons <br/>\nconnected with some kind of school or university are about the only <br/>\nway to go (you use the school&#39;s instruments). I just got the name of <br/>\nthe percussions instructor at the same university that is giving the <br/>\ngroup strings lessons so I&#39;ll be calling him soon.
