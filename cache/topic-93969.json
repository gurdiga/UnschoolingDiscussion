It can be as a babysitter or <br/>\nmother&#39;s helper.  Usually doesn&#39;t cost too much and you can usually find students <br/>\nwho like kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, near us we have a private university that has a parent coop playschool <br/>\nthey call it.  It&#39;s only 2 hours a day and kids can go as many days as parents <br/>\nwant to sign them up for: once a week or every day.  A different parent helps <br/>\nout everyday and they don&#39;t do any teaching, hence the name playschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the baby probably naps every day you could have a helper come during <br/>\nnap time just as a special friend to play with your 4 year old.  That would give <br/>\nyou some time to work.  And since it&#39;s almost summer vacation, this is a good <br/>\ntime of year to find someone!<br/>\nAlso, I would suggest having your son help you out too.  My almost 4 yr old <br/>\nloves construction stuff and has wood scraps, nails, hammer, etc to use when he <br/>\nwants.  Could he also help out at the home site as well?  I know that someone <br/>\nwould have to take time to watch him, etc but it would probably make him feel <br/>\nmore a part of the process.  Even if he only goes there a little bit to help: <br/>\ncarry hammers, etc- that might be enough for him to know that &quot;mommy needs to <br/>\nwork on house stuff right now&quot; and perhaps he would be willing to let you <br/>\nhave some time to work.  <br/>\nWe have a big sandbox right outside our window and my son uses that sometimes <br/>\nwhile I work at the computer.  He also enjoys computer games and &quot;new&quot; movies <br/>\nor books from the library that keep his attention when I need to take care of <br/>\nsomething- phone call, computer, etc.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93964,"nextTopicId":93977}}
