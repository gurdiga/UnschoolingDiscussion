How do you explain to a 4yr. old?**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got a few thoughts on this one, because I have a very fiery daughter<br/>\nwho will be four this fall. She&#39;s quite a handful! I think the number one<br/>\nthing that helps in situations like you are discussing is just to first try<br/>\nto see things from her standpoint. What does she know about this situation?<br/>\nHow does she feel? Would she know that feeding the baby wrong give it colic?<br/>\nEven if she knew that, would she be able to control her urge to keep holding<br/>\nonto that bottle. Or if she&#39;s mad, can she really possess the self-control<br/>\nto contain it? I can&#39;t always do that, it&#39;s a tall order for a 3 or 4 year<br/>\nold! So once I&#39;m in that headspace of &quot;What is my child feeling?&quot; instead of<br/>\n&quot;my child is misbehaving&quot;, I can try to let go of my own fear, anger,<br/>\nembarassment, or whatever is going to make me react to this situation<br/>\ninstead of helping my daughter learn, which is really what I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would do in this situation is to explain why the baby needs its<br/>\nbottle and needs its mom to feed it to her. If my daughter is still angry<br/>\nabout that, I would offer to hold her or help her move through the anger,<br/>\nbut I would remove her from the baby if she was causing it to get fussy and<br/>\nhave problems feeding. I might suggest something like getting a water bottle<br/>\nor cup and feeding one of her own dolls or stuffed animals. My daughter&#39;s<br/>\nstill nursing, so I&#39;d definitely suggest that as a way for her to calm down.<br/>\nI might find a way to give her some power back, because losing control over<br/>\nthe bottle is losing power and small kids I think feel quite powerless. Even<br/>\nif we parent them respectfully and they get more power than other small kids<br/>\n(like determining food and bedtime), they still can&#39;t go where they want<br/>\nwhen they want and do everything they want, they depend on us for<br/>\ntransportation, providing food, etc. It&#39;s got to be hard at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to use an example that happened when a friend of mine was over here<br/>\nwatching my kids yesterday: My daughter (3) and her daughter (4) were having<br/>\na tussle over a toy. My daughter was lying on the floor and screaming and<br/>\nbeing angry about it and in general being a 3 year old. My friend suggested<br/>\nreading a book, and asked my daughter if she wanted to pick the book out or<br/>\nhave her brother pick it out. My daughter leaped off of the floor and said<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ll pick it out!&quot; and Bingo, tantrum over. She got to do something fun,<br/>\nshe was given power when she was feeling powerless (not being able to<br/>\ntotally control a toy that her friend had). Sounds like a good solution to<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In lots of ways it is fine, he<br/>\n&gt;can eat when he wants to, he can go to bed when he wants to...but I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t think he should spit in my face, am I wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely not! If my kids are mad and do something that&#39;s not appropriate,<br/>\nI just tell them &quot;You can be as mad as you want, but you cannot &lt;&lt;spit in my<br/>\nface, hit your sister with that baseball bat, throw a rock at the dog,<br/>\nwhatever&gt;&gt;&quot;. I give them alternatives: &quot;You can throw this pillow at me!&quot; or<br/>\nsomething like that, or I tell them that I can hug them if they want that<br/>\n(my son usually does, my daughter doesn&#39;t). But keep in mind that you cannot<br/>\n*make* your child not spit at you. Sure, you can throw consequences at him -<br/>\ntime-outs, spankings, etc. but he still might do it the next time he gets<br/>\nmad and then you have to keep escalating the consequences until he reaches<br/>\nthat point some day where he is too big to hit or control and then where are<br/>\nyou? Instead, if you build a relationship of trust *now*, by the time he is<br/>\nbig, he will trust you with situations he can&#39;t handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do tell my kids my expectations for appropriate behavior: &quot;It&#39;s not okay<br/>\nto spit at someone, if you&#39;re feeling that angry you can do X, Y, or Z&quot;)<br/>\nI tell them my feelings: &quot;I don&#39;t like to be spit on, that doesn&#39;t feel nice<br/>\nto me.&quot;<br/>\nI might even set my own limits: &quot;I am not going to stand near you while<br/>\nyou&#39;re spitting.&quot; or &quot;You can spit outside, but not inside. Would you like<br/>\nto go spit at a tree?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll recommend again the book &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot; and<br/>\nhave your husband read it too if you can. It gives excellent descriptions of<br/>\nalternatives to punitive parenting. It gives a step-by-step road map to get<br/>\nthere from where you are. It&#39;s an excellent book.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] principles vs rules","postDate":"1052794272","msgId":68800,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Mi4xYTQ4Y2QwYi4yYmYxYjdhMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68783,"nextInTopic":68884,"prevInTime":68799,"nextInTime":68801,"topicId":68742,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/12/2003 10:09:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

Every time, without<br/>\nexception.   I missed his cues about being hungry, or tired or stressed<br/>\nor overly stimulated, or his need to be cuddled or whatever it was.  If<br/>\nwe are parenting badly how can we expect them to respond in the best<br/>\nways?<br/>\nI&#39;m not making a judgement about your parenting, I&#39;m just suggesting you<br/>\nlook at how you&#39;re interacting with him, communicating with him and see<br/>\nif there is something you can help him with.   Does he need more of your<br/>\ntime, more ideas about feeling good about himself and his family?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s little.   He just plain doesn&#39;t have all the information and tools<br/>\nabout communication someone your age has.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd please remember he doesn&#39;t want you to feel bad about him.  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to feel bad about you.   He must have a powerful need to<br/>\nexpress himself to you for whatever reason.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis behavior you don&#39;t like is not because you&#39;re not spanking any more.<br/>\n  It&#39;s because he&#39;s needing something, and trying to express it and<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have a better way to do it at the moment.   <br/>\n<br/>\nStay warm and loving to him and spend time with him whenever you can.  <br/>\nIn happy times make sure he knows you like to be with him and in his<br/>\ndifficult moments make sure he know you love him no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to understand he&#39;s behaving exactly the way he&#39;s able to right now.  <br/>\nImagine how frustrating things must be for him to be feeling this way.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s doing the best he can. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ll play the imagination game.  Maybe everything wasn&#39;t as fine as<br/>\nyou thought that day.  Maybe there were little problems with your friend<br/>\nor her kid and Jaiden did his best to cope, but when you were out of the<br/>\nroom, away from him, he was on his own with these people who were maybe<br/>\ngetting on his nerves.    Maybe he thought he was being friendly and kind<br/>\nto give the baby the bottle.   Maybe it seemed an insult for your friend<br/>\nto oppose him.   Maybe all he needed was a reason the baby couldn&#39;t have<br/>\nthe bottle but he just got a bossy &quot;stop that&quot; from the mom. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much do you talk to him about feelings and love and family and<br/>\nhappiness?    <br/>\n<br/>\n***How do you explain to a 4yr. old?***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of stands out in your post, and I wonder how you communicate<br/>\nwith him.

He shouldn&#39;t be spitting in anyones face! :)  I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to make a gentle assumption here to make my response flow in a more <br/>\nunderstandable way...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are in the same place I was/am.  Once I stopped spanking <br/>\nand punishments in general, I went a bit overboard and decided anything and <br/>\neverything had to go.  I was revamping the ship and startin from scratch.  <br/>\nThe problem with that is my children were used to being punished and <br/>\nspanked.  I made the mistake of not listening to myself.  I just kind of up <br/>\nand let everything go cold turkey.  Some things, like smoking habits and <br/>\nspanking are excellent things to go cold turkey on but rythyms and disipline <br/>\naren&#39;t.  Children still need guidance and limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I cut out my little ones bedtimes (which are flexiblebut no later than <br/>\n9pm), quiet times and general mealtimes, they went haywire.  I made the <br/>\nmistake of thinking that gentle parenting, peaceful parenting, whatever term <br/>\nyou use, meant total and complete freedom.  I set aside my own inner voice <br/>\nand listened to other people that were on the opposite extreme of where I <br/>\nwas.  Many of whom led completely child-centered lives.  By that I mean, if <br/>\ntheir child refused to ride in a carseat, either they wouldn&#39;t leave the <br/>\nhouse or they would let their child roam free in the car.  (This was an <br/>\nexample given to me at one time.)  I went against *my* inner voice and chose <br/>\nnot to leave the house, because I certainly wasn&#39;t going to allow my 18 <br/>\nmonth old son ride around in the car jumping up in my lap!  I soon figured <br/>\nout that I was going to have to insist on car seats but I found ways of <br/>\nkeeping him occupied so he wasn&#39;t miserable.  It worked.  There were <br/>\noccasions when he would climb out so I pulled over and either let him run <br/>\naround in the van for a while or gave him something new to distract him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key with Jaiden (sorry but I think I may have misspelled his <br/>\nname) is to give him limits and guidance.  I realize you weren&#39;t in the room <br/>\nat the time, so in that case, I would have explained to him, in front of the <br/>\noffended, that when he is asked to return someones belongings, in this case <br/>\nthe bottle, he needs to give it back, otherwise he will have to stay with <br/>\nMommy while the baby and her mommy are visiting.  At that point, I might <br/>\nhave also offered him his own baby doll to feed.  As far as spitting in your <br/>\nface, I would let him know that it isn&#39;t okay to spit on other people and if <br/>\nhe feels angry, he can talk about it and go outside and spit in the grass if <br/>\nhe feels like he needs to.  This way, he has the opportunity to let out his <br/>\nfrustrations without harming other people.  The *I hate you* stage is pretty <br/>\nnormal, I think and I would respond that I understand you are upset so why <br/>\ndon&#39;t we go spend some time outside together and we can talk about it.  If <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t wnt to talk about it, try spitting in the grass with him!  He&#39;s <br/>\nyoung and probably felt like he was trying to help the baby.  When the <br/>\nstruggle ensued, he most likely became confused and frustrated.  And hey, if <br/>\nyou go spit with him, you will most likely both end up laughing.  You <br/>\noffered clear boundries (we return other peoples belongings when asked, we <br/>\ndon&#39;t spit on other people), allowed him to vent his anger and frustrations <br/>\n(voicing his feelings and spitting on the ground), and you can now enjoy <br/>\neach others company again (spitting together and laughing).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope all this made sense!

I gently removedJaidens hand from the bottle and asked him <br/>\nto come sit with me in the rocking chair, he turned to me screamed <br/>\nthat he hated me, spit at me, and ran and locked himself in his room.<br/>\nhe&#39;s 4. Honestly, it was all I could do to keep from marching in <br/>\nthere and spanking him. We stoped spanking and I have been fighting <br/>\nwith Jason lately over the decision, this is not the first time <br/>\nJaiden has done something like this, although, this has been the <br/>\nworst, thus far.<br/>\n<br/>\nJAson feels like that we stoped spanking and have since let jaiden <br/>\nrun over us, and I guess its true.  I have been trying so hard to <br/>\nlook the other way and accept the fact that he has to test us, and <br/>\nsee if we would take it back and start spanking again, and we haven&#39;t <br/>\nnot that I haven&#39;t been tempted(I&#39;m really embaressed to admit it, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s true) and I have steped in and kept Jason a few times. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is becoming a problem between me and Jason, he doesn&#39;t like the <br/>\nway JAiden is treating me and the fact that he absolutly will not <br/>\nlisten to anything Jason will say, something that bothers JAson soooo <br/>\nmuch. Jason is willing to belive me that not spanking will work and <br/>\nthat we won&#39;t have out of control kids that are major problems, we <br/>\nhave a friend that dosen&#39;t spank and her son is violent towards her, <br/>\nhis sister and pretty much everyone and it is just ignored and jason <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want that. ummm oh yah, so JAson is willing to not spank, as <br/>\nhard as he sometimes finds it, because I keep telling him that I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want our kids spanked and I feel really strongly about it but, <br/>\nhe keeps asking what it is that we should be doing. And honestly, I&#39;m <br/>\nat a loss, I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read that we should have principles instead of rules, but how do <br/>\nyou make the switch? How do you explain to a 4yr. old? Jaiden keeps <br/>\nsaying that he&#39;s the boss and that no one can make him do anything, <br/>\nso he&#39;s gonna do what ever he wants. In lots of ways it is fine, he <br/>\ncan eat when he wants to, he can go to bed when he wants to...but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think he should spit in my face, am I wrong? So how do I do it, <br/>\nhow do we make the switch? I know that there is no instant cure for <br/>\nall of this, but we are struggling and things are bad and I&#39;ve tried <br/>\ntalking to friends and family and I get &#39;spank him&#39; or &#39;just ignor it&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry this is so long and all over the place but Avery is really <br/>\nsick and I&#39;ve had to stop about 20 times and I keep looseing my train <br/>\nof thought, so if anyone made it to the end of this, I thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69053,"nextTopicId":69059}}
