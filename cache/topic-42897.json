I mean I&#39;m a big advocate about learning how to not <br/>\nautomatically say no to things without thinking. I also believe you have to <br/>\nchose battles and no&#39;s wisely.

Generous with his money, with his knowledge, and with his time. <br/>\nHe was/is always thinking AHEAD. I sometimes hate asking him for anything <br/>\nbecause I know he&#39;ll give it even if he can&#39;t--or shouldn&#39;t. He WILL. Always.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe pulled me aside one day when I was almost 14. I was horse-crazy and knew <br/>\nwe couldn&#39;t afford a horse (who can?). He said it was time to buy me a horse <br/>\nbecause I would &quot;find&quot; boys soon and he wanted me to enjoy the horses while I <br/>\ncould (little did he know! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day Duncan was asking about a toy or something. I said that I just didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave that kind of money right now. Maybe when I get paid again. He said, <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ll ask Pa.

I have often counseled other mothers who are overwhelmed <br/>\n&gt; and feeling trapped in no-ville that they should find a way to say yes <br/>\n&gt; to whatever their kids want at any given moment.  Many times it just <br/>\n&gt; lifts the spirits of everyone and the kid feels loved after a short time <br/>\n&gt; of yeses and won&#39;t harangue and harrass mom so much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I learned this from my dad.  He&#39;s such a *great* dad.  I remember my mom <br/>\n&gt; was always the &quot;no&quot; person.  But one time he stuck up for me, and <br/>\n&gt; insisted I be allowed to go on a high school spring break ski trip.  I <br/>\n&gt; will always love him for that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When my oldest children were little, Dad would take them for a couple of <br/>\n&gt; weeks at a time.  (I was single then, and he was giving me a break.)  He <br/>\n&gt; always reported that they behaved perfectly and were happy and had a <br/>\n&gt; good time.  They always came back completely centered and content.  He <br/>\n&gt; said that was because he resolved when my eldest was born to never say <br/>\n&gt; &quot;no&quot; to his grandchildren, even if he knew what they were asking he <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t possibly provide.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Think about how hard that would be?  Never say no?  Sometimes he had to <br/>\n&gt; be creative; he would say &quot;later&quot; or engage them in conversation about <br/>\n&gt; it until they came to the conclusion that they didn&#39;t need/want it.  But <br/>\n&gt; because he&#39;d never said no to even their tiniest request, they&#39;ve never <br/>\n&gt; asked for anything impossible.  This is some of the best advice found in <br/>\n&gt; &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen...&quot;, too.  And he&#39;s probably never even <br/>\n&gt; heard of that book.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids never ask him for anything anymore, because they know he&#39;d give <br/>\n&gt; it to them, and they&#39;re grown up enough and love him enough to not want <br/>\n&gt; to burden him.  He has a very nice Jeep and a ski boat and numerous <br/>\n&gt; other toys, that they know they can use anytime.  But they don&#39;t.  I <br/>\n&gt; think just knowing they can is enough.  And they express true gratitude <br/>\n&gt; to him, which is nice to see.  They think the world of each other.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s hard, hard, hard when you&#39;re the parent and not the grandparent, to <br/>\n&gt; have a relationship with your kids like that.  But every little bit helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42853,"nextTopicId":42937}}
