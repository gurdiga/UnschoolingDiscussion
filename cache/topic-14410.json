That is the only thing that<br/>\nwould make this a problem.  Perhaps talking with your child about what hir<br/>\ngoals on this subject are is a good idea. (You have probalby done this<br/>\nalready but I am only going on one post so sorry in advance ) If child<br/>\ndecides that workbooks offer little for hir, that is okay. Are you honest<br/>\nwith 12 year old about why you insist on work?  Is it to calm your worry?<br/>\nAsk yourself why s/he needs to know this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example from my own situation involves spelling. My oldest daughter, who<br/>\nis 10 learned to read at about age 6.  because reading and writing are<br/>\nlumped together in many curricula, I rahter expected her to be able to write<br/>\nand spell as well. (changed views on this but will save for another<br/>\ndiscussion) She did the common things in developing her writing, ie words<br/>\nwith just the consonant letters, then sticking the vowel letters on the end,<br/>\ninverting consonant pairs, etc.  One day, when she was 8 1/2ish, she wrote<br/>\nsomething which made me smile. She was trying to spell a certain word, but<br/>\nto my adult eyes it said something different.  She got very cross with me<br/>\nand I said well if you want to learn to spell properly, then lets start<br/>\ndoing lessons.  She responded by saying that she did not want to do lessons,<br/>\nshe wanted me to stop laughing at her.  SO i did. I set myelf a goal in my<br/>\nown head to not worry about spelling until she was 10.  Then if I needed to<br/>\nI was going to leave it another year etc etc.  But in the time that I left<br/>\nher alone I saw her understanding grow and her spelling is pretty good now.<br/>\nI have learned to trust both her and myself.  That is a hard lesson to learn<br/>\nfor us because we have had to distrust ourselves in order to survive in<br/>\ninstitutional settings. Since most of us have been schooled it is hard to<br/>\nbegin to think of life in an unschool-type way.  But even older children can<br/>\ngrasp concepts without being &quot;taught&quot;.  We also have to question why we<br/>\nassume that we need to know certain things?  Your child may already know all<br/>\nof the math that s/he will ever need to know. If not, a choice later to<br/>\nattend a course may alter the situation. But the choice is hirs.<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I understand that for the younger child learning  maths by *doing* -<br/>\n&gt; having a 25% slice of cake etc is fine.
