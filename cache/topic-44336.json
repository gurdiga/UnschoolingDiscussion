I<br/>\nplayed in the band all through school so had some understanding of music, at<br/>\nleast treble clef.  My dd took piano lessons and I asked her questions to<br/>\nlearn bass clef.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to the music store and bought some very simple arrangements of music<br/>\nI liked and then just messed around with it.  I learned to play the right<br/>\nhand and then the left hand and then put them together.  I don&#39;t use the<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; fingerings according to dd but I get the job done.  I have found<br/>\nolder country music to have fairly easy to master arrangements available.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44335,"nextTopicId":44328}}
