And her flow of writing is uninterrupted by the formalities of <br/>\nspelling. She is a prolific writer, with notebooks full of stories, poems, <br/>\nfacts and observations. And from what I can see, her spelling improves every <br/>\nday. I&#39;m not about to mess with success. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that phonics rules are useless, or something to be avoided. <br/>\nI&#39;m just saying that in my experience the rules are not something that need <br/>\nto be &quot;taught&quot; in a systemized fashion. Or that they are something that need <br/>\nto be in place before a child can begin to write freely. For me, Casey&#39;s <br/>\nwriting has been evidence that spelling progress *can* be achieved playfully <br/>\nand over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the explanation of the i before e rule. I must admit though, that <br/>\nall of the rule stuff was pretty dry reading and I tended to just skim over <br/>\nit. And the fact that even you, who seem VERY well versed on your phonics <br/>\nBTW :o), gave a wrong example with the &quot;ull&quot; sound, leads me to believe <br/>\nthere are easier ways to achieve the goal than trying to always remember a <br/>\nrule.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you are so passionate and knowledgable about the phonics rules, you <br/>\nmay be able to pass on this knowledge to your kids in a natural, playful <br/>\nway. The way Sandra does with word origins to her kids.

(I&#39;m not attacking, I&#39;m <br/>\nreally curious. :o)) My daughter has always been unschooled and learned to <br/>\nread in what I guess would be called a whole language approach. She was <br/>\nsurrounded by language (written and spoken). We read to and with her, <br/>\nanswered her questions, played games, etc. No formal lessons of any kind. <br/>\nShe&#39;s 8 and a pretty good reader by most standards, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer spelling also improves every day. She&#39;s doing this by real life writing. <br/>\nLetters to friends, stories, poems, labels, charts, etc. Sometimes she asks <br/>\nme for spellings and I&#39;ll throw in a helpful phonics rule. Lots of times <br/>\nI&#39;ll just spell the word for her. Other times she knows instinctively or <br/>\nsomething how to get to a correct spelling.I haven&#39;t seen any negative <br/>\nspelling effects for her based on how she learned to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son *does* have trouble with spelling and sounding out words. But he was <br/>\nthe one who got more phonics in his life. I also wouldn&#39;t blame phonics for <br/>\nhis difficulties, though. It think it has more to do with how his brain <br/>\nworks. He&#39;s a big-picture thinker and gobbles up entire paragraphs without <br/>\nworrying about the details of one or two words. Works for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Most of us learned from ps, and maybe didn&#39;t remember all the rules, but <br/>\n&gt;&gt;learned the basic i before e except after c, type thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I remember reading once that this rule is &quot;not&quot; true more often than it &quot;is&quot; <br/>\ntrue.
