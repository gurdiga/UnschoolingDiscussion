It seemed to become the most important thing in <br/>\nthe world to him. (There&#39;s a boy in our Scout troop who is allowed half an <br/>\nhour of TV a day. Guess what he does the entire time when the meetings are <br/>\nat our house.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second son (4) had pretty much unlimited access, but he&#39;s much less <br/>\ninterested. He does watch TV -- Rugrats and his &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; <br/>\nvideo are his faveorites -- but he spends much more time drawing, looking at <br/>\nbooks, building forts, playing with Legos, playing with his brother, <br/>\nwhatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just decided not to make a big issue out of it any more. The older guy no <br/>\nlonger seems to eagerly pine for TV at all times, though he too still <br/>\nwatches a couple hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have to say that having watched some of the cartoons they like <br/>\n(Rugrats, the Wild Thornberrys, Ed Edd and Eddy, Spongebob) I find the shows <br/>\nabout 100 times more literate and wittier than the cartoons were when I was <br/>\na kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older boy is finally picking up a book and going into a quiet room to <br/>\nread for pleasure -- no prompting. He&#39;s 8. I have always been a bookworm, we <br/>\nread together a lot and I had always hoped he would come to share the joy I <br/>\nget from books. But I decided I would never tell him to read, because that <br/>\nwould undermine the whole point of doing it  because you love it. I took <br/>\ngreat encouragement from a wise friend of mine who has two teenage boys. She <br/>\nobserved that she knows few boys who &quot;love to read.&quot; But she knows lots of <br/>\nmen who do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24325,"nextTopicId":24520}}
