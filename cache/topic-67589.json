It reminded me of an unschooling moment <br/>\n( or 3) that we had a couple of days ago.  We were going to Big Lots in a <br/>\n&quot;next town over&quot;.  We hit interstate, and as usual, JP asked me.. &quot;how far is <br/>\nit?&#39;  We  passed a sign that said &quot;14 miles to Statesville&quot; So, I said. .. <br/>\n&quot;14 miles, there is the sign&quot; and pointed it out.  Then he asked.. &quot;Moma, how <br/>\nfar is 1 mile&quot;  So, I set the trip odometer and said.. &quot;OK.. starting .. NOW, <br/>\nI will tell you when we have went 1 mile&quot;.   He watched the tenths add up and <br/>\nthen.. &quot;YAYY.. we went one mile!&quot;  So then he asks, &quot;how long does it take to <br/>\ngo one mile?&quot;   Anna chimed in..&quot;it depends on how fast you are driving&#39;&quot;  <br/>\nShe looked at the speedometer and said.. &quot;we are going 70 miles an hour, so <br/>\nits less than 1 minute to go a mile&quot;  JP said.. &quot;Oh yeah, because there are <br/>\n60 minutes in a hour.. if we go 60 miles an hour, we go one mile in a minute&quot; <br/>\n   I said, &quot;thats right, so how long will it take us to get to Statesville?&quot;  <br/>\n  He and Anna talked it over.. calculated a bit, and finally said, &quot; Well, if <br/>\nwe keep going 70 mph, it will take less than 14 minutes.. probably about ..12 <br/>\nminutes&quot; I said.. &quot;OK, we will time it&quot;.. I put the van on cruise control at <br/>\n70mph and sure enough, it took us just under 12 minutes to get to our exit.   <br/>\nIn all of that.. JP figured out that exits are about a mile apart.  He <br/>\ncounted the exits and watched the numbers til we got to our exit and he <br/>\nsaid.. &quot;Moma. it is  a mile between each exit&quot;  I was suprised that he figured<br/>\n that out.. I was over 30 before I knew that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the kids ask &quot;how long, how far, how much??&quot;  and I may ask them a <br/>\ncouple of questions to help them figure it out.. OR, if they are just <br/>\ninterested in finding out the answer, I just tell them.    Or, I will give <br/>\nthe answer with the &quot;solution&quot; built in..  Like.. &quot;Moma, can I buy this with <br/>\nthe money I have?&quot;  Instead of saying &quot;yes or no&quot;  I would say, well, you <br/>\nhave $10, and this costs $14, so no, you need $4 more to buy that.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67489,"nextTopicId":67601}}
