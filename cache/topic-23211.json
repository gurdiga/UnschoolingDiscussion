Oh that sleep thing...she <br/>\nstopped napping at 15 months. She&#39;s 6 1/2, is up til 10 or 10:30, often after <br/>\nme, and up at 6 or 6:30. And believe it or not, we shoot for 8 as a bedtime. <br/>\nIt just takes that long! The last couple of months I&#39;ve been just letting her <br/>\ngo to bed most nights when she wants, and a couple nights a week she&#39;ll go <br/>\nearlier, by and hour or hour and a half or so. That seems to be working <br/>\nbetter. And up until this past year, she still woke every night. Now, not at <br/>\nall, unless she has a bad dream. Chiropractics helped with that. She had leg <br/>\npains behind her knees every night for years, and the pediatrician kept <br/>\ntelling me they were activity pains, because she is so highly active (and <br/>\nthat&#39;s an understatement!!!), or growing pains.We did arnica cream, heating <br/>\npads, midnight hot baths, massage, children&#39;s Tylenol--nightly!!! I asked to <br/>\nrefer her to a chiro, he said no way, only an orthopedic specialist. So I <br/>\nchanged peds, got a referral, and after 4 sessions, she has had no pain <br/>\nwhatsoever. That was in April. I&#39;ve heard that adjustments can make a <br/>\ndifference for some kids with ADD and so forth, too.<br/>\nI think she will always be a challenge for me. We spent last night, 9:30 to <br/>\n12:30 in the ER with my hubby (he&#39;s fine), and DS was wonderful. Didn&#39;t fuss <br/>\nat all. She was non-stop complaining, fussing, etc. <br/>\nOh, the Cherry Plum is for violent temper tantrums. It&#39;s horrid tasting. I <br/>\nthink the shock of how horrid it tastes quiets her down, LOL. But we&#39;ve done <br/>\nbreath work, visualizations when she is not upset so she&#39;ll have a place to <br/>\nretreat to when she is upset. But I think the two things that help calm her <br/>\ndown from tantrums more than anything are: nature and water. The bath, or <br/>\nswimming, depending on the season--water is a great restorative. And we have <br/>\na lovely property, with a stream, all kinds of wildlife, hundreds of flowers, <br/>\nlots of frogs (she spends a lot of time with the frogs. She even talks to <br/>\nthem. Can&#39;t tell them apart!!) And sending her outside for a nature walk <br/>\nusually seems very healing for her.<br/>\nReminds me of a lady I know, Linda Runyon. Not sure if anyone&#39;s ever heard of <br/>\nher? She is a survivalist. She has been written about in several major mags <br/>\nlike People, and the NY Times, I think? She has a son (grown now) who was <br/>\ndiagnosed severely autistic, and 6 doctors her in NJ told her to <br/>\ninstitutionalize him. She couldn&#39;t accept that, so she moved west (she&#39;s back <br/>\neast now) and raised him &quot;off the land&quot;. She cooked outside in the snow <br/>\nbecause her son couldn&#39;t handle it inside. She had no electricity, etc. They <br/>\nforaged for their food. They ate things that grew naturally, like dandelion, <br/>\nwood sorrel, plantain, roses, wild lettuce, etc. She is a well published <br/>\nauthor now about this subject. Her son is now an internation fashion <br/>\ndesigner, and Neiman Marcus recently bought his entire collection. He credits <br/>\nhis &quot;recovery&quot; with living so close to nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, We tried the cal-Mag, couldn&#39;t get her to take it. <br/>\nOne of her favorite bedtime rituals now is hot tea, her choice of flavor (she <br/>\nusually picks Japanese tea or chamomile). The ritual thing is really <br/>\nimportant for her, too. She does better if she knows what to expect. <br/>\nRenee<br/>\n<br/>\n~2000 B.C. - Here, eat this root. <br/>\n1000 A.D. - That root is heathen.
