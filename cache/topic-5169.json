I frown,<br/>\n&gt; Thinking of everyone that has forgotten me, or hates me. I narrow my blue<br/>\n&gt; eyes,<br/>\n&gt; my blond hair in meatballs. I think maybe if I look evil I can win. But<br/>\n&gt; Deep down I know it&#39;s not true. I start to remember the Loved ones that<br/>\n&gt; want me to come back.

I take a deep breath<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; and close my eyes, what will happen if I can&#39;t survive? Will my enemies be<br/>\n&gt; happy, or will my friends?  Nor will the Loved ones be glom or dead. I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t tell which way to go. I just feel the hot sting of tears and my<br/>\n&gt; scepter in my hand. I open my eyes and look around the ring, to see no one<br/>\n&gt; standing behind me. No one for backup. I&#39;m all alone, again. I think. Then<br/>\n&gt; there it sits at far corner of the ring. I walk up to it. My heeled boots<br/>\n&gt; clinking as I take steps. I pick it up to see it just disappears. I fall<br/>\n&gt; to my knees crying. &quot;Love or Death&quot; I repeat over in my head. I can&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt; this any more. There&#39;s no happiness in my life. What&#39;s going to happen if<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t survive? I close my eyes again, letting my scepter fall to the<br/>\nground.<br/>\n&gt; Then I feel the darkness take the friendship of others away from me. I<br/>\n&gt; breathe in deeply, and then open my eyes to see I cannot survive or<br/>\nbreathe. I<br/>\n&gt; scream. Nothing comes out. I look over at my scepter. Glowing bright just<br/>\n&gt; like my heart deep down inside. I can survive, I can make it. I slowly<br/>\nstart<br/>\n&gt; to breathe again. I stand up and grab my scepter and look around to see<br/>\n&gt; everyone that cares.. Loves. And hates me behind me ready to help. I<br/>\n&gt; smile thinking I can survive.
