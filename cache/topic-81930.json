All it meant was that<br/>\nthe case was proven.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the ministry would have to review options as to how to ensure the<br/>\nchildren were educated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssociate Professor Paul Rishworth of the Auckland University law school<br/>\nsaid a judge could not make an order that required children to go to<br/>\nschool and there was nothing in the Education Act that said children<br/>\ncould be physically uplifted and made to go to a school.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne would assume parents would start taking steps to school their<br/>\nchildren after being convicted of failing to do so. An option for the<br/>\ncase, he said, could be mediation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe family, understood to have strong religious beliefs, are refusing to<br/>\ntalk about the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a family friend said the couple were hard-working and they did not<br/>\nwant to send their children to school because they did not like the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said many people living locally thought that was their right.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther families had not been sending their children to school for<br/>\ngenerations.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren were instead taught by aunts, uncles and other friends of the<br/>\nfamily, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They just want to be left alone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMr Eve said the ministry did not know what sort of education the<br/>\nchildren were getting because the family had not allowed its officials<br/>\nto assess what the children were being taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last record of any children in the family attending school was 1995,<br/>\nwhen two children were enrolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was an unusual case because usually a board of trustees had to<br/>\nensure a child was attending school. But there had been some records of<br/>\nhome schooling in 1996, so the matter fell into the ministry&#39;s hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1999, a certificate allowing the mother to educate the children was<br/>\nrevoked after a routine assessment by the Education Review Office.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;These kids aren&#39;t getting their legal right to an education,&quot; Mr Eve said.<br/>\n<br/>\nProfessor Michael Townsend of the Auckland University School of<br/>\nEducation said it was important for children to attend school to learn<br/>\nabout the history of New Zealand, its place in the world and their place<br/>\nin New Zealand.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is impossible for a family to isolate themselves from the world<br/>\naround them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t  \t<br/>\n©Copyright 2003, NZ Herald<br/>\nÂ &lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
