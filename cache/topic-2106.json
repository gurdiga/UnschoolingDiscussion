Yesterday we found a tiny spider crawling<br/>\nacross the floor of my sons&#39; room while we were playing together.  Usually<br/>\nI let spiders go outside, telling the boys that bugs like to live in the<br/>\ngarden.  Unless it&#39;s a Hobo (Dangerously venomous spiders we have in<br/>\nabundance here, in the same neurotoxin class as Black Widows and Brown<br/>\nRecluses.)  Anyhow I pointed out this tiny (ant sized) spider to my 2 year<br/>\nold and he promptly tried to pick it up between his fingers.  I said &quot;No!<br/>\nDrop It!&quot;  So he dropped the mushed ball that was once a spider, and he said,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Spider wans ta walk some more.  He wans ta walk, Mommy.&quot;  Then, after<br/>\nstudying the lifeless form for a moment, &quot;I Broke it, Mommy!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI explained that, just like with the cats, we have to be careful with all<br/>\nanimals, and that particular spider would not be walking anymore.  He<br/>\nforgot about it shortly.  It was one of those precious moments...&quot;I Broke<br/>\nit Mommy!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2035,"nextTopicId":2104}}
