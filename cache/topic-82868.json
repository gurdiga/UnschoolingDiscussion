I am only about 20 min from Amherst!<br/>\nAnd--housing is unbelievably cheap here compared to the rest of the state.<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n*********************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI lived in Boston as a child and teenager and years later went to college in<br/>\nWestern Mass. in &quot;the happy valley&quot; as it is sometimes called.  Western<br/>\nMass. was a great place to live.   My stepfather is living there now and<br/>\nmoved there from Cambridge to get away from the things you seem to want to<br/>\nleave.  There are a lot of small and larger, village-y like towns and five<br/>\nmajor colleges (Amherst, Smith, Hampshire, UMass and My. Holyoke).  I lived<br/>\nin both Northampton and in Amherst and there is a large college pop. but the<br/>\nlocals have a firm standing.  Unless it&#39;s changed a lot, you don&#39;t feel<br/>\noverrun by the college pop.   I gave my step-father a book named _Home<br/>\nTown_ by Tracy Kidder, that is about Northampton.   Reading it convinced my<br/>\nstep-father&#39;s wife (my mother is no longer alive) to check out the area.  I<br/>\nhave read it and don&#39;t know exactly what did this, but it is a good book.<br/>\nThere are a lot of possibilities in that area and it is beautiful;<br/>\nmountains, valleys,  great swimming watering holes in hidden bits of the<br/>\nforests, a huge variety of culture and of people...  I would love to move<br/>\nback there.  I don&#39;t know about the local hschooling laws there though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadeline</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81993,"nextTopicId":82872}}
