Explaining a child<br/>\nthat she is fustrated is acting out is not a lie. <br/>\n<br/>\nCritisim is a destructive way and saying she is bad. <br/>\nOne word I do not like to put in the same sentence<br/>\nwith children.  Ben will learn to criticize otherw<br/>\nwhen he gets older. Critisims leads to no friendships.<br/>\n No one in this world is perfect we have to except<br/>\npeople for who they are and the mistakes they have<br/>\nmade and if we can&#39;t we move on. I think this a better<br/>\nsolution.  Of course this is my opinion. Ithink the<br/>\nwords your are using can be re phrased.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is it right to teach Ben to blame others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When they are, in truth, to blame, then yes it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Her  is thoery on blame.  When we blame others we give<br/>\nin to anger instead of excepting and preventing the<br/>\ntime there is an issue Anger builds fustration<br/>\nespecially in children because they are still learning<br/>\nto control their feelings.  Blaming others is another<br/>\nway to feel better.  There are better way than<br/>\nblaming.  It can cause a loss of self esteem<br/>\nespecailly if ben did something wrong because he will<br/>\nblame himself. What good is blame if he can&#39;t handle<br/>\nthe solution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI really thought TCS had something interesting,<br/>\nunfortunately it seems that the consequences of the<br/>\nissues were not thought out throughly.

It&#39;d be a<br/>\n&gt; lie to act like it was<br/>\n&gt; fate.  Also, it&#39;s a bad idea to accept bad things. <br/>\n&gt; TCS recommends that<br/>\n&gt; people solve their problems.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Blame is something many adults suffer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from.  I think it something that hinders society.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No.  Bad theories is something many adults suffer<br/>\n&gt; from that hinders<br/>\n&gt; society.  These come from coercion.

My personal way of handling it, <br/>\noftentimes, is to talk to the kids separately. I get to hear only one side at <br/>\na time, of course, but it just always seems to be useful to get them apart <br/>\nand let each kid talk and talk. Once they get it all out, I can often say <br/>\nsomething like, &quot;Is there anything that you&#39;d do differently if you could <br/>\nstart over?&quot; Sometimes they&#39;re still too angry to think that way and they <br/>\nsay, &quot;NO!!!&quot; and they jump right back into justifying what they did do. <br/>\nSometimes they can say, &quot;Yeah, I could have....&quot; and they have some idea of a <br/>\ndifferent way to have handled whatever horrible thing it is that the other <br/>\nkid did. Sometimes the kid can even go so far as to explain to ME how the <br/>\nother kid was feeling and why they behaved the way they did. SOMETIMES I only <br/>\nget to talk to one kid, because they leave me and go talk, themselves, to the <br/>\nother kid and they resolve the problem together. Sometimes I meet with each <br/>\nkid, they both are too angry to resolve the problem at that time, and I make <br/>\nsome kind of temporary decision myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow, we are getting new chairs in our living room. One of our old chairs <br/>\nis the one that I sat in and nursed all three kids -- they LOVE the chair. <br/>\nThey all want it moved into their room. This morning my 17 yo and my 11 yo <br/>\nhad a major screaming angry fight over it. I asked them to go to separate <br/>\nrooms and I talked, first, to my 11 yo because she seemed most distraught. <br/>\nAfter she &quot;dumped&quot; -- all her anger and frustration was out -- I said, &quot;Well, <br/>\nyou BOTH really want that chair, do we have ANY possible solutions?&quot; She <br/>\nstarted in on &quot;NO, I want it....&quot; and I said, kind of in an excited tone of <br/>\nvoice, &quot;Wait --- suppose there was some sort of trade off, maybe something <br/>\nshe could give you or do for you, that would make you willing to let her have <br/>\nthe chair. If there was such a thing, what might it be?&quot; She came up with <br/>\nmaybe half dozen ideas. ONE was that the older kid would pay a $20 deposit <br/>\nand then, when the older sister goes off to college (which is going to be in <br/>\na year or so), the chair would be hers. If there was any damage, she&#39;d also <br/>\nget to keep the $20. (This is pretty funny, considering this is a grubby old <br/>\nworn-out 20-year-old chair, but what she&#39;s worried about is reasonable since <br/>\nmy older daughter does tend to ruin things - she writes on them, drips candle <br/>\nwax on them, dribbles paint on them, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought maybe I&#39;d get the younger one some kind of cool special chair <br/>\n- like one of those inflatable kid-size ones - just because she did end up <br/>\nwithout the chair and she did really really want it so it was nice that she <br/>\nwas even willing to consider an alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nSome of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>\nharsh.
