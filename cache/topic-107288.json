This <br/>\nlast time, it was interesting to see because there was a little boy <br/>\n(maybe 5? DS is 7) in the car next to us. About 20 minutes until <br/>\nmovie time. DS had been playing with some other kids (he brings his <br/>\npair of light sabers to battle with) but they had to go with their <br/>\nmom (pre-movie bathroom and snack stuff). So, this other little kid <br/>\nhad been watching them from his seat at the open window of his <br/>\nvehicle. He started talking to DS about the light sabers and DS <br/>\nasked if he wanted to come out and play. Kid&#39;s dad shook his head <br/>\nno. DS came over to me. I said &quot;Well, it looks like his dad doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant him to come out of the car.&quot; DS talked to the kid another <br/>\nminute then went around to the driver&#39;s side window and quite calmly <br/>\nand coolly asked the DAD if it would be okay for the boy to come out <br/>\nand play. I guess something got to him (maybe courtesy and <br/>\npoliteness?) because the mom apparently convinced the dad and she <br/>\nand the boy came out. She leaned on their vehicle while DS and her <br/>\nson had a grand time with the light sabers - DS even let the boy be <br/>\nAnakin (the good Jedi Anakin) while he was Darth Vader with the red <br/>\nlight saber. Then they switched. And when we signalled that the <br/>\nmovie was about to start, they calmly packed up, said goodbye and <br/>\nwent back to their respective spots (we sit inside the pickup - big <br/>\nbench seat way more comfortable than beach chairs for one). <br/>\n<br/>\nGee, so DS &#39;should&#39; go to school to learn sharing, courtesy, <br/>\npoliteness, respectful address for others,...?

Would you all be willing to toss out some examples of<br/>\ninteresting things that you&#39;ve done recently, or are getting ready to<br/>\ndo?  ==<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re listening to Harry Potter on books-on-tape -- we&#39;re a little<br/>\nbehind, so we&#39;ll be picking up Book 4 from the library tomorrow.  But<br/>\nlast Friday we went to our local bookstore&#39;s HP6 party, just for the<br/>\nparty -- we didn&#39;t stay for the book. &lt;G&gt;  Fisher (8) dressed up in<br/>\nhis wizard&#39;s hat and a homemade cape, made a sparkly wand, touched a<br/>\nhedgehog at the &quot;Care of Magical Creatures&quot; booth, and brought home,<br/>\nnot a Harry Potter item, but a Pirate&#39;s Treasure Chest that had a lot<br/>\nof historical information and knot-tying information &lt;G&gt;.  So since<br/>\nthen we&#39;ve been playing pretend pirates quite a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been playing lots on our new birthday trampoline -- both kids (8<br/>\nand 2) can do way more with their bodies than they could a few weeks<br/>\nago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also pretend to drive the cars a lot -- Riley in particular, but<br/>\nFisher often joins in.  Our minivan is alternately a space ship, a<br/>\npirate ship, and an actual car being driven by crazy people on the<br/>\nfreeway.  Riley likes to turn the radio up loud and blow me kisses as<br/>\nhe&#39;s driving -- I think he&#39;s been watching his papa.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur area has some free water parks (not slides -- just water shooting<br/>\nout of the ground at different places and different intervals), so we<br/>\nvisited one of those last week.  There are summer programs there that<br/>\ninclude having board games and crafts materials available, so we used<br/>\nthose as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFisher has switched from playing Pokemon on his GameBoy to playing<br/>\nMegaMan.  He is reading the game guide and telling me all the ways<br/>\nthat the stats and the various pieces of information interrelate.  We<br/>\nplay pretend MegaMan and come up with some pretty tough Net<br/>\nNavigators, thanks to his incisive analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nFisher saw a new Bionicle advertised that he&#39;s interested in, so we<br/>\nmay be checking that out tomorrow or the next day.  We just picked up<br/>\nsome MadLibs and some of the Invisible Ink books, so we&#39;ve been<br/>\nplaying around with those.  Fisher got a big stuffed snake, so he&#39;s<br/>\nbeen carrying that around his neck and we tell all sorts of snake<br/>\nstories together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRiley&#39;s new fascination is pouring his own soda and putting ice in it.<br/>\n If I have any carbonated drink that I&#39;m not using, I take it out to<br/>\nthe deck with a cup and a small tub of ice, and let him go to it.  The<br/>\nfizz just fascinates him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been writing more and getting my Tarot cards out some.  Sometimes<br/>\nFisher comes by and asks about the pictures, so we talk about world<br/>\nreligions and mythology and symbols.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been watching Dragonball Z on Cartoon Network with great<br/>\ninterest, as it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve seen this part of the series. <br/>\nWell, Riley isn&#39;t as interested in DBZ.  Riley and I love the Boobahs<br/>\nand the Wiggles.  Very trippy, all of it.  Riley likes to blow us down<br/>\nand to wake us up, Wiggles style.  We have lots of games on the<br/>\ntrampoline of falling over and bouncing back up again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur life in a nutshell -- lots of learning and connections and<br/>\ninterests, coming from all over.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: the problem with the list being quiet...","postDate":"1121739134","msgId":107344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwLjYxZWIyZmIzLjMwMGRiYjdlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107343,"nextInTopic":107346,"prevInTime":107343,"nextInTime":107346,"topicId":107288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/18/2005 9:29:18 P.M.

Daily we care for our horse, ride her, and work at the farm we board<br/>\nher at.  We also just went to our family reunion a couple weeks ago at a<br/>\nlocal campground.  That was fun!  We are seriously thinking of selling our<br/>\npop-up camper for a second horse.  One of my dd&#39;s isn&#39;t sure she is ready to<br/>\nmake that change, but change always comes hard for her.  She keeps changing<br/>\nher mind.  We&#39;ll wait a bit longer and see what happens.  Maybe wait and get<br/>\none with our tax return next year.  I am reading All Things Wise and<br/>\nWonderful to me and I am reading some other horse series books to the girls.<br/>\nWe have been playing Scatagories lately too and that&#39;s been fun and we also<br/>\nplayed Beyond Balderdash at my sister&#39;s and that was fun too.  We are off to<br/>\nride the horse with some other girls from the barn.  Got to run but I&#39;ll try<br/>\nto think of what else we&#39;ve been doing while we&#39;re gone.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: the problem with the list being quiet...","postDate":"1121723331","msgId":107339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwYjI4MjY1NTQ0ZDNkMWI1ZTA3NzMxNGFkM2U0ODFjQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyREMwODM2LjUwMzA4QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGRiZ25kZys3YmY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDJEQzA4MzYuNTAzMDhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":107338,"nextInTopic":107340,"prevInTime":107338,"nextInTime":107340,"topicId":107288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Roxana is 17.

She&#39;s in two musical theater shows at the same time <br/>\n(Anything Goes and You&#39;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown) and taking dance <br/>\nand vocal classes. Doing two shows also means a fair amount of time <br/>\nspent shopping - for the right tights, leotard, shoes, make-up, <br/>\nstrapless bra, hairspray, etc., etc., etc. &lt;G&gt;  In between all that, <br/>\nshe role plays on Desperate Fans (Live Journal community).<br/>\n<br/>\nRoya is 20 now - I don&#39;t know if she really counts anymore as an <br/>\nexample of an unschooler, but SHE thinks she does so:<br/>\nshe is working two days a week in an adult education program through <br/>\nthe community college - she&#39;s an aide in a sign language class for <br/>\ndevelopmentally disabled adults, she tutors math to adults who are <br/>\nwanting to get their GED, she works in the office sometimes, and has <br/>\neven taught knitting and crocheting to the developmentally disabled <br/>\nadults classes when they did units on &quot;hobbies.&quot;<br/>\nShe&#39;s taking summer classes at Cal State Long Beach where she&#39;s a <br/>\nfull-time student now. She finished one class already - it included a <br/>\nweek-long trip to a completely undeveloped island fifty miles off the <br/>\ncoast (the island next to the Island of the Blue Dolphin one).  She&#39;s <br/>\ntaking a class now on managing recreation programs (majoring in <br/>\nRecreation and Leisure Studies). She&#39;s discovered she has a HUGE <br/>\nadvantage in her major over other students because she unschooled and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have any arbitrary lines in her mind dividing <br/>\nleisure/recreation activities from work or learning activities. She <br/>\nalso has been doing a lot of working out - kickboxing class, aerobics, <br/>\nswim fitness, and going to a gym.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie is 14 and doing a LOT of hanging out with friends. Spent <br/>\nyesterday all day at Downtown Disney with another girl and 4 or 5 boys <br/>\n- all of these are kids who do karate at the same studio. They made a <br/>\nbear at a place where you stuff and dress a stuffed animal yourself, <br/>\nthey ate, they went to a movie (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). The <br/>\nkids are 14 to 19 years old. Last week she was in Palm Springs with a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s family for a few days - just swimming and playing games and <br/>\nreading and - hanging out. She did take a voice class a couple of times <br/>\na week, for 4 weeks, but that&#39;s done now.  Tomorrow she&#39;ll go to karate <br/>\nat noon and then stay and - you guessed it - hang out with her friends <br/>\n- play games, listen to music, talk, eat, until another karate class at <br/>\n7:30 pm. Wednesday she&#39;ll, hmmm, hang out at the park with her friends, <br/>\nall day. Thursday would be a repeat of Tuesday except Roxana&#39;s got a <br/>\nshow in the morning and a bunch of us will go see that. Then, back to <br/>\n--- hanging out. &lt;G&gt; When she isn&#39;t physically WITH her friends, she&#39;s <br/>\nmostly talking to them by IM or emailing or live journaling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are mostly like me - high energy and not usually comfortable <br/>\nsitting around the house much. Like to be on the go and involved in a <br/>\nlot of outside stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not necessarily recommend it - more down time would probably be <br/>\nhealthier! We get stressed and cranky - probably need more time spent <br/>\nrelaxing.

A friend gave us a Saxon<br/>\nmath book awhile back and Dylan looked at it briefly but he didn&#39;t do a<br/>\npage of math or study it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe did make bad jokes about the ordinal number of Cardinals during the<br/>\nnews coverage of the selection of a new Pope. <br/>\nAs a bird watcher I was glad (for the first time ever) we don&#39;t get<br/>\nCardinals in western Montana.  I think he got &quot;ordinal&quot; and &quot;cardinal&quot;<br/>\nfrom that book because I don&#39;t recall it ever coming up before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan can add, subtract, multiply and divide.  As far as I know he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know the written formula for long division and as I said before,<br/>\nhe can&#39;t recite multiplication tables.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut he can figure interest on his savings account.  He can figure a<br/>\nfifteen percent tip at a cafe.  He can figure whether he has enough money<br/>\nfor the books he wants to buy.   He can draw plans for bird and bat<br/>\nhouses, measure and cut the wood and put the pieces together.  He just<br/>\nbuilt a nice bookshelf for his bedroom. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo my knowledge he&#39;s never looked at a biology textbook.  He has field<br/>\nguides that he refers to often, and he looks things up on-line.  He can<br/>\nidentify hundreds of birds local to our area and he can identify almost<br/>\nany insect, bug or spider he comes across in our area.  With regard to<br/>\nspiders specifically he can usually identify them at least to the genus<br/>\nif he can watch them for awhile or see what kind of web they make.   He<br/>\ncan recognize many plants and trees.  When we&#39;re hiking he can tell the<br/>\ndifference between Douglas fir and spruce, lodge pole and ponderosa pine,<br/>\netc.   My teacher neighbor calls every evergreen tree a &quot;pine tree.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s the thing about Dylan.  He likes bugs and birds and growing<br/>\nthings.  So when he comes across a thing he hasn&#39;t seen before he is<br/>\ncurious about it.  He wants to know what it is.

Read at<br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/unschooling  and read at www.unschooling.info   you<br/>\ncan read the message boards and a collection of articles and posts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not schooling.  Unschoolers don&#39;t school their children at<br/>\nhome.  Unschoolers believe learning is a natural part of living life. <br/>\nUnschoolers  provide their children with an interesting environment and<br/>\ninteresting opportunities and do not make their children study formal<br/>\nacademics.<br/>\n<br/>\n***How do you get your kids to do things they hate but need, like Algebra<br/>\nor<br/>\nBiology? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m forty two and can&#39;t recall the last time I *needed* algebra or<br/>\nbiology.  I believe the only person qualified to determine what my son<br/>\nneeds (and what he will need in the future) is my son.  I came to believe<br/>\nthis after examining my own schooling and after talking with many people<br/>\nwho went to school and after reading for years about school, learning and<br/>\nunschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would not try to get my kid to do something he hated.  I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s an unhealthy practice.  There are probably a lot of reasons people<br/>\nbecome full of hate and being forced to do what one doesn&#39;t want to is a<br/>\nbig one.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***She never writes a sentence. No journal, no letters, heck she doesn&#39;t<br/>\neven IM or e-mail<br/>\npeople.***<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither does my husband.  He never learned to type and e-mail and IM<br/>\ndon&#39;t interest him.  We got a microphone for our computer and he can IM<br/>\nhis sister in Germany via voice.   My husband can write, he just rarely<br/>\nhas a reason to.  His job requires little writing.  He has a good life in<br/>\nspite of not keeping a journal, not writing letters.   He knows the<br/>\nsecret.  Talk! Telephone!<br/>\n<br/>\n***She play a computer game or watches cartoon all day every day.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s doing those things because she&#39;s interested in them then she&#39;s<br/>\ndoing fine.  If she&#39;s doing them because they&#39;re the best things<br/>\navailable right now, make more things available.  Go places, experience<br/>\nnew things, get busy. <br/>\n<br/>\n***My son is following her lead. He&#39;s 11 and can&#39;t say his times tables<br/>\nup to 5.***<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither can I and since leaving school I&#39;ve never been required to do so.<br/>\n Not once has my life been in jeopardy nor my fiendish plans foiled<br/>\nbecause I couldn&#39;t recite times tables.   My son is thirteen and cannot<br/>\nrecite the multiplication tables.  He has never needed to.  The only time<br/>\npeople ever have to do that is in school.  If your children are not in<br/>\nschool, forget about memorizing multiplication tables.   My son can<br/>\nmultiply though and keeps score in cribbage and other games where<br/>\nmultiplication is the fastest way to confirm he&#39;s winning. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n***What am I doing wrong?***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re thinking like school.  You don&#39;t have to think like school when<br/>\nyou&#39;re kids are home.  Live like you never heard of school.   Do things<br/>\nwith your kids, enjoy them, make life interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\n***My children have zero curiosity about anything. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just told us they like video games and cartoons.   Do you mean<br/>\nthey&#39;re not curious about things you&#39;d like them to be curious about? <br/>\nIt&#39;s not the same thing.   My son is not at all interested in algebra but<br/>\nhe is interested in movies and cartoons, WWII, insects, fine art,<br/>\nanimals, driving, hiking, music, cooking...<br/>\n<br/>\n***I even took all electronic gadgets away from them for two weeks hoping<br/>\nboredom<br/>\nwould make them pick up a book or go outside and explore something, nope,<br/>\nthey slept or fought until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be pretty angry if someone took away the things I really liked.  I<br/>\nthink your kids responded in a normal way when they tried to escape a sad<br/>\nand dull period in life with sleep and I think you&#39;re lucky they didn&#39;t<br/>\ntry to escape with something else.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wanted their world to be bigger so you made it smaller.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmake any sense at all.  <br/>\nPeople are rarely inspired by punishment.  If you&#39;d like them to have a<br/>\nbroader world provide more, not less.  Be inspiring.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143938653,"authorName":"K Krejci","from":"K Krejci &lt;kraekrej@...&gt;","profile":"kraekrej","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the problem with the list being quiet...","postDate":"1121478284","msgId":107301,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzE2MDE0NDQ1LjkxMTgzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0MzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzE1MTU1MzI3LjMzMzk1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNzA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107300,"nextInTopic":107302,"prevInTime":107300,"nextInTime":107302,"topicId":107288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We just had a night with King of the Hill where I got to explain why Luanne s chest jiggled, why Boomhauer, Dale and Bill were in a mental institution and why ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1022417825\">We just had a night with King of the Hill where I got<br/>\nto explain why Luanne&#39;s chest jiggled, why Boomhauer,<br/>\nDale and Bill were in a mental institution and why<br/>\nConnie&#39;s parents freaked out over Bobby being in her<br/>\nbedroom with his shirt off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best part is framing things so a 6<br/>\nyear-old gets his curiosity satisfied without throwing<br/>\nin excessive judgements.

Maybe see <br/>\nif there are any video game conventions around that she&#39;d enjoy - plan <br/>\na trip. SUPPORT her interests and broaden her horizons by building off <br/>\nof her interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Parents need to read the video game section of Sandra&#39;s website.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCartoons - this is just TOO easy. Watch them with her, first of all. <br/>\nTalk about them. Cartoons are filled with allusions to all kinds of <br/>\nhistory and geography and sociology and often politics, too. Notice <br/>\nwhich cartoons she seems to enjoy - learn about those a bit so you can <br/>\nshare a little information. RENT cartoons - get into them. Expand the <br/>\ninterest in cartoons to include all kinds of animated stuff -- have you <br/>\nsee Spirited Away? It is incredible! Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, too. <br/>\nWatch The Simpsons and King of the Hill and Futurama -- all animated - <br/>\nall FILLED with social commentary, horizon-broadening material.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND - plan a vacation to Los Angeles or New York to visit the Museum of <br/>\nTelevision and Radio -- you can visit Nickelodeon Studios, Disney <br/>\nStudios, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND - once you start supporting your kids - be FLEXIBLE - don&#39;t get <br/>\nyour heart set on them being fascinated by cartoons and animation, it <br/>\nmight turn out that they&#39;re not at all interested. It might turn out <br/>\nthat while you&#39;re in the middle of planning that trip, looking at <br/>\ninformation about Los Angeles, that they get excited about, say, <br/>\namusement parks, or the beach, or Hollywood, or whatever -- so GO with <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut -- I&#39;m cringing thinking that they&#39;re probably seeing their choices <br/>\nas veg out in front of the tv versus do algebra or biology or memorize <br/>\ntimes tables.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a concrete example would be good --<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are watching cartoons - you sit down and watch with them. Say <br/>\nthey&#39;re watching Yogi Bear &lt;G&gt;. You say, &quot;You know Jellystone Park is <br/>\nreally based on Yellowstone Park - we should go there someday.&quot;  Or you <br/>\nsay, &quot;I went to Yellowstone Park once - and the bears were all lined up <br/>\nalong the road into the park, begging for food. Some people actually <br/>\nlowered their car windows and handed them food.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all. Unless it just happens that you see a spark of interest - <br/>\nor unless one of the kids asks a question - or unless you think they&#39;d <br/>\nbe INTERESTED in knowing about the geysers there. And so if you tell <br/>\nthem about Old Faithful -- you can wonder out loud if any of that <br/>\ngeothermal energy is being used to make electricity.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to RESEARCH all this - and you don&#39;t have to say what I <br/>\njust said. And you don&#39;t have to go get them a book on Yellowstone to <br/>\nread or build a model of a geyser out of papier-mache, or explain to <br/>\nthem how geothermal energy is used to make electricity or anything else <br/>\n- you can just allude to things - just mention little bits of related <br/>\n&quot;trivia&quot; that you might happen to know and think of while watching <br/>\ncartoons with your kids. BUT don&#39;t interrupt the cartoons - I mean <br/>\ndon&#39;t be annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to judge how much to say, how far to take things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is that it really truly doesn&#39;t matter WHAT the kids are <br/>\ninto - watching tv and playing computer games is fine! It is how well <br/>\nthe parents are able to create a rich environment that supports and <br/>\nexpands on and respects and builds on the kids&#39; interests that makes <br/>\nfor a great unschooling life.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr - think about other aspects of life. They do EAT right? So - bring <br/>\nhome something unusual from the grocery store. &quot;Look at this, guys! It <br/>\nis a fruit from south america that I&#39;ve never had before.&quot; They don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to TASTE it - just introduce it to them. Now they know that there <br/>\nare things in the grocery store they didn&#39;t know about before, that <br/>\nfruit might come from South America and that the US imports food.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I saw a guy on the street corner selling coconuts - he&#39;d <br/>\ndrilled a hole in them and there was a straw sticking out. I should <br/>\nstop and buy one and bring it home. And I should just mention that a <br/>\ncoconut is grass seed. And we should talk about where they guy on the <br/>\nstreet corner got it and why he&#39;s selling them on the street corner and <br/>\nthat when I was growing up NOBODY sold anything on street corners.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr not.  If we&#39;re in the middle of a fascinating conversation about <br/>\nfashion or cartoons or something else, I might not want to interrupt <br/>\nthat with stopping to buy a coconut right then.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - but, for kids interested in cartoons, maybe get started watching <br/>\nall the Disney movies! Plan a trip to Disneyland and go to California <br/>\nAdventure where they have a huge Animation area - with lots of <br/>\nactivities related to making animated movies. And, at Disneyland, go <br/>\ninto the little theater that shows the very earliest silent cartoons <br/>\nwith Steamboat Willie and so on. It is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just sounds like mom is not doing HER job as an unschooling parent - <br/>\nlike she&#39;s waiting around for the kids to get tired of tv and say, <br/>\n&quot;Mom, I want an algebra book.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT can happen - it happened at my house. But only when algebra was <br/>\nsomething that came up in the swirl of everything else, just one more <br/>\nreally interesting thing along with cartoons and video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230706843,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the problem with the list being quiet...","postDate":"1121442807","msgId":107300,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzE1MTU1MzI3LjMzMzk1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNzA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNzU3NjJDQjc3NUM2Qy0zNjAtMUY1RkNATUJMSy1NMzYuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107299,"nextInTopic":107301,"prevInTime":107299,"nextInTime":107301,"topicId":107288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** Now, his favorites are: The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, and Family Guy.

I have a high school junior who only does Algebra when I make <br/>\nher<br/>\nand only does Biology if you count watching Animal Planet. She never <br/>\nwrites<br/>\na sentence. No journal, no letters, heck she doesn&#39;t even IM or e-mail<br/>\npeople. She play a computer game or watches cartoon all day every day. <br/>\nMy<br/>\nson is following her lead. He&#39;s 11 and can&#39;t say his times tables up to <br/>\n5.<br/>\nWhat am I doing wrong? My children have zero curiosity about anything. I<br/>\neven took all electronic gadgets away from them for two weeks hoping <br/>\nboredom<br/>\nwould make them pick up a book or go outside and explore something, <br/>\nnope,<br/>\nthey slept or fought until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think that my boys KNOW what they need. And because they&#39;ve not <br/>\nlearned any different, they don&#39;t even know to hate some things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Cameron (17 and schooled for nine years) DID, but he&#39;s all healed <br/>\nnow and enjoys many different things---but that took time and patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, we don&#39;t divide the world into subjects. Biology IS <br/>\nalgebra ID hstory IS language IS art. It&#39;s all related and <br/>\ninter-related. My boys don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; algebra or biology, but those things <br/>\nare huge parts of their lives because we see them in every day things. <br/>\nCaring for our dogs and cats and rabbit and rats and bees---not to <br/>\nmention ourSELVES!---IS biology. So&#39;s caring for our garden and <br/>\nhouseplants and the wild birds that we&#39;ve really grown to know and <br/>\nlove. Cooking and grocery shopping is biology. Our visits to the doctor <br/>\nthis summer for strep and a bad reaction to a bee sting qualify as <br/>\nbiology too. We stopped to look at the armadillo on the side of the <br/>\nroad---armadillos are NOT local! We don&#39;t know how he got here! <br/>\nBiology! Cooking a mushroom soufflee tonight for Ben&#39;s little Tour de <br/>\nFrance party is biology. Watching all this rainfall and the jungle it&#39;s <br/>\nturned our yard into----and keeping track of hurricanes that were <br/>\nthreatening our friends&#39; homes---uh huh---that too!<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t know how my boys could avoid biology in their lives. <br/>\nSeriously! And Animal Planet is FULL of biology! Duncan has collected <br/>\nsooo much info from that channel! Things even I didn&#39;t know! Don&#39;t <br/>\nunder-estimate that!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for algebra: what&#39;s that line you use, Sandra? Why do we need to <br/>\nstudy algebra? Because it&#39;s part of our every day world? Well, then we <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to set up artificial algebra because it&#39;s naturally a part <br/>\nof our every day world! If it weren&#39;t part of our world, why study it? <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt; We use algebra every day. It&#39;s simply figuring &quot;x&quot;---a variable. <br/>\nI use variables to do almost everything! So do the boys. In almost <br/>\neverything we do there&#39;s a variable! How we deal with that variable <br/>\nproves how well we understand it. That&#39;s why schools use word problems! <br/>\nBecause we use them in real life every day! &lt;g&gt; The formula is EASY <br/>\nafter you understand the principle of variables!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Duncan (9) knows what the times tables are, but he knows <br/>\nwhat eight sixes are---and thirteen sevens. He can figure it out <br/>\nprobably *because* he isn&#39;t familiar with the times tables. He&#39;s <br/>\nfigured his own algorithms. Don&#39;t ask me how. I&#39;m still in the dark, <br/>\ndepending on my times tables! or my fingers. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t refer to my children as &quot;students&quot;---they are nine and 17. <br/>\nHaven&#39;t you heard? Grades are for meat and eggs, not children! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much writing do mine do? Very little, I guess. But what they DO <br/>\nwrite is essential and meaningful. They can both write thank you notes. <br/>\nThey can write grocery lists. Cameron writes love letters to Carly and <br/>\nkeeps a sporadic journal. Duncan dictates wild, fun stories; he keeps a <br/>\njournal too, but it&#39;s become filled more with artwork than words <br/>\nlately. The big differnce here is that none of these things are <br/>\nrequired, expected, or forced. They do these things because they are <br/>\nimportant to my boys. Their writing has meaning to *them*.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t discount cartoons either!!! Duncan&#39;s vocabulary is HUGE because <br/>\nof cartoons! First, with Ed, Edd, & Eddie---he learned many words that <br/>\nmost six-year-olds don&#39;t know! &lt;g&gt; Now, his favorites are: The <br/>\nSimpsons, South Park, Futurama, and Family Guy. Because these are <br/>\nsoooooo incredibly current and in-your-face--and rather *adult*, we&#39;ve <br/>\nhad all SORTS of discussions about all KINDS of topics---some which <br/>\nmany may not considder appropriate for a nine-year-old. But we talk a <br/>\nLOT, and I answer many, many questions. And I LOVE TiVO!!! It makes <br/>\ndiscussions of these shows so much easier!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you watch TV *with* them??? That makes a difference! Mine have so <br/>\nmany questions---and I know what interests them and how certain things <br/>\nmake them feel. Cameron is into That 70&#39;s Show. Hell, I LIVED That 70&#39;s <br/>\nShow! &lt;g&gt; So that has brought up a lot of subjects and the history <br/>\n(ugh!&lt;g&gt;) of my childhood!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys often join me and Ben while we&#39;re watching the Tour de France. <br/>\nCool things there to learn! History, geography, geometry, physics, <br/>\nnutrition, statistics, sportmanship,...ALGEBRA! &lt;g&gt; All inter-related <br/>\nin a bike race!<br/>\n<br/>\nAre YOU fascinating? Are YOU curious? What do YOU do during the day? <br/>\nMaybe they&#39;re simply following *your* lead and modelling *your* <br/>\nbehavior. I was recently described as a shark---if I stop moving, I&#39;ll <br/>\ndie! &lt;g&gt; I model that for my boys. Cameron is a bit more busy than <br/>\nDuncan. But he&#39;s 17 and has wheels! And four jobs, a girlfriend, and a <br/>\nband. For all of their lives, they&#39;ve watched me be in &quot;into&quot; a zillion <br/>\nthings. I have a friend who is very sedentary: I really don&#39;t think she <br/>\nshould expect much more from her kids. Mine see &quot;busy&quot; and interested <br/>\nand interesting as normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for taking away their entertainment---that&#39;s just mean. I would <br/>\nbecome angry and resentful if you did that to me. So---after you did <br/>\nthat, what did you offer them? To go out for Japanese food for lunch? A <br/>\ntrip to the beach with a picnic? To tie-dye shirts and sheets? Did you <br/>\ntoss a pork shoulder into the oven and have each of you make up <br/>\npersonal BBQ sauces? Did you do to Lowe&#39;s and pick out a new color of <br/>\npaint to re-do their rooms? (That&#39;s also a sure-fire way to get a room <br/>\nclean! My room is next on our list! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that you just left them to do nothing and expected them to <br/>\nproduce. Anger. Resentment. Fighting. Yep.<br/>\n<br/>\nBE interesting! BE interested! BE curious! BE fascinating! BE *with* <br/>\nthem! DO *with* them! You don&#39;t get another chance! You&#39;re going to <br/>\nmiss them when they&#39;re gone! Have FUN....NOW!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh---and come to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference near St <br/>\nLouis October 6-9, 2005 and watch other unschoolers in action.

My <br/>\nguess is they have been &quot;schooling&quot; in some form until now (or <br/>\npretty recently) since you &quot;define&quot; your DD as a &quot;high school <br/>\njunior&quot; instead of a 16 yr old (or whatever age she is).<br/>\n<br/>\nNext question: why is algebra or biology (or whatever) right now <br/>\nimportant to -you-? Is it anything she can&#39;t do next week, next <br/>\nyear, 5 yrs from now? Does her brain have an &quot;expiration date&quot; when <br/>\nno new learning can occur? Odds are, you&#39;re racing (mentally) to <br/>\nwhen she gets to be 18 and goes to college and... but reality is she <br/>\n*may* choose to postpone college and work. I&#39;ve got a BS degree and <br/>\nI&#39;ve been in the &quot;career world&quot; for 20+ years and I&#39;ve *never* used <br/>\nmy high school biology (except maybe playing trivia games and such) <br/>\nand with a business/IS degree, didn&#39;t need much science in college <br/>\neither (I can&#39;t remember ever taking a science course - maybe I did, <br/>\nmaybe I didn&#39;t, either way it means little if I can&#39;t remember it). <br/>\nMy DH went right from public high school to work - started with <br/>\nstock boy and mailroom clerk type jobs through managing 2 or 3 <br/>\npeople in a &#39;shop&#39; environment for an office supply company to doing <br/>\nhigh tech work at software companies(phone support, web design, <br/>\netc). A decade after high school, he choose to start college (as a <br/>\nfreshman) and tested out (via the CLEP tests) of ALL the 101 <br/>\nscience, math, history, fine arts, and English courses - for a <br/>\nlittle $ and a few hours of testing he ended up as a 2nd semester <br/>\nsophomore after 1 semester of classwork. He said he knew most of the <br/>\nstuff on the tests from living life and from watching Jeopardy and <br/>\nplaying Trivial Pursuit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOdds are taking away the electronics then giving them back has led <br/>\nto them spending MORE time on electronics just in case they get <br/>\ntaken away again (just guessing).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you know they have &quot;zero curiosity about anything&quot;? They <br/>\nprobably do - it&#39;s just not formed, communicated, packaged into <br/>\nsomething that looks like a school subject. What are they watching? <br/>\nWhat games are they playing? Have you sat with them and watched? <br/>\nAsked about it (with TRUE interest) - what they are doing? what they <br/>\nlike? what they don&#39;t like? (most gamers have ideas about &#39;how I <br/>\nwould do it differently&#39; as well as &#39;this is a really cool part&#39;). <br/>\nDo you interact with them - bringing snacks perhaps, folding laundry <br/>\nin the same room, *be*ing together? <br/>\n<br/>\nTake a &#39;vacation&#39; from &#39;school&#39; thoughts and go do something fun for <br/>\nyourself, ask what they might want to do that&#39;s fun (no fair <br/>\nlimiting things to &#39;educational&#39;) - a day at the skateboard park? a <br/>\ntrip to the store for a new game? a matinee movie? a picnic in the <br/>\nliving room? a whole day without mom hovering over them with a <br/>\nworried look?<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"the problem with the list being quiet...","postDate":"1121432180","msgId":107288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmNy5kYmVmMDMzLjMwMDkwYzc0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":107289,"prevInTime":107287,"nextInTime":107289,"topicId":107288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have a policy of asking those who join the list to read for a couple of weeks to get a feel for the tone and opinions and all.
