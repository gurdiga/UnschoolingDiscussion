The reason I suppose is because this is a<br/>\nvery hot country.  Things that you could leave in the<br/>\ncupboard in the UK (bread, butter) you would want to<br/>\nkeep in the fridge here.  Old houses have spaces for<br/>\nshort small fridges but all new houses have spaces for<br/>\nlarge two door fridges and microwaves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe aren&#39;t soda drinkers in this country the way<br/>\nAmericans are.  We call it fizzy drink and tend to buy<br/>\nsmall bottles at the store and drink them right away,<br/>\nbuy bigger bottles to take home for parties or<br/>\npurchase it at Americal style fast food outlets<br/>\n(MacDonalds, Burger King etc.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also a rather multicultural country and things<br/>\nlike rice cookers and electric stir fryers as well as<br/>\nthe good old crock pots are common.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we are really big on are bbqs and every family<br/>\nhas one and many cook all meals on them and gatherings<br/>\nof family and friends outdoors often revolve around a<br/>\nlarge bbq cook up.  They are provided everywhere for<br/>\nfree on beaches, at nature reserves, parks etc.  We<br/>\ncook our dinner outside on our gas bbq more nights<br/>\nthan not.  The beauty of this is that traditionally<br/>\nDad is the chief bbq cook (man and fire and all that)<br/>\nand this gives Mum the night off...unless you&#39;re like<br/>\nme whose hubby does all the cooking anyway indoors or<br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam in Sydney<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n___________________________________________________ <br/>\nOn Yahoo!7 <br/>\nDesperate Housewives: Sneak peeks, recaps and more.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoo7.com.au/desperate-housewives\">http://www.yahoo7.com.au/desperate-housewives</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112603,"nextTopicId":112543}}
