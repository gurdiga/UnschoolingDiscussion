We had a neighbor <br/>\nonce that beat their kids, left a young child of about 7 standing in <br/>\nthe rain for about 2 hours locked out of the house when they weren&#39;t <br/>\nthere (we took him in to our house when we found him), had no beds <br/>\nfor the children so we gave them an extra queen sized bed and frame <br/>\nand the parents took the bed and the kids didn&#39;t get it according to <br/>\nthem.  One of the kids was sent to his room for going into the <br/>\nfridge and then spanked for looking out the bedroom window after <br/>\nbeing punished for the fridge incident. It was sickening!  We felt <br/>\nthat for the safety of the children we had a responsibility to get <br/>\nthe law involved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in our situation I feel that it is because our life doesn&#39;t <br/>\nremotely resemble what they consider &quot;normal and good&quot; therefore <br/>\nthey feel the need to try and convince us of our need to change.  So <br/>\nI guess in that respect it is different but I see your point with <br/>\nwhat we would consider an unsafe, abusive or neglectful situation.  <br/>\nSomeone has to stand up for the innocent, in a wierd sort of way I <br/>\nthink that&#39;s what people think that they are doing for my kids :(<br/>\n<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"what is not anyone else&#39;s business?","postDate":"1131903906","msgId":109763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0YS4xMDk1MzQ2LjMwYThkNWEyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":109770,"prevInTime":109762,"nextInTime":109764,"topicId":109763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
