Mainline Protestants -- Episcopalians,<br/>\nMethodists, Lutherans, UCC&#39;s, Presbyterians and so on -- don&#39;t make<br/>\ndistinctions in the mainline faiths on who is and isn&#39;t Christian. And as<br/>\nfar as I know the mainline Protestants were officially okay with the<br/>\nCatholics being Christian ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one time the Catholics were anti-Protestant but that rift&#39;s been<br/>\nrepaired. (Vatican II in the 60&#39;s maybe?) (Catholics have told me they<br/>\nweren&#39;t allowed to even enter a Protestant church as a kid.) In fact the<br/>\nCatholics and Episcopalians are getting really chummy!<br/>\n<br/>\nMormons do have an entirely separate book (or books?) of beliefs involving<br/>\nanother Prophet. From a mainline point of view it&#39;s hard to see very<br/>\nsignificant additions to Christianity as Christian. But from a Mormon point<br/>\nof view it&#39;s just Christianity plus ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the fundamentalists it&#39;s about who is and isn&#39;t going to heaven and a<br/>\nbattle between God and the Devil. If you&#39;ve accepted Jesus Christ as your<br/>\npersonal Savior you&#39;re Christian and going to heaven. If you haven&#39;t, then<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t and are in need of saving. In practice it gets way more complex<br/>\nthan that because the Devil can be subtle and lead people down what appear<br/>\nto be Christain paths which aren&#39;t really. So &quot;true&quot; Christians need to be<br/>\nable to recognize true doctrine from false, eg, interpretting the Bible the<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way, thinking the &quot;right&quot; way, behaving the &quot;right&quot; way. So in<br/>\ntheory for fundamentalists what church someone attends doesn&#39;t dictate<br/>\nwhether they&#39;re Christian or not. Their Christianity is in their personal<br/>\nrelationship with Jesus. In practice, in order to avoid being led astray and<br/>\navoid exposing children to false teachings, the requirements are a lot more<br/>\nstrict. So the fundamentalists are really just trying to protect people&#39;s<br/>\nsouls by pointing out who is and isn&#39;t Christian. Sort of the Consumer<br/>\nReports of the True Christian faith ;-) (I&#39;m teasing partly but not totally.<br/>\nAnd if I&#39;m off a bit, others will help by clarifying!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82877497,"authorName":"Cheryl Duke","from":"&quot;Cheryl Duke&quot; &lt;cheryl@...&gt;","profile":"windysnowdancer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Walk Away","postDate":"1025461773","msgId":38807,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODQwMWMyMjA2NCQxNTlkM2Q0MCQwMjAxYThjMEBhbHBoYXdvbGY2OT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE3OS5hOGI1NzJmLjJhNTBhNDllQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38804,"nextInTopic":38810,"prevInTime":38806,"nextInTime":38808,"topicId":38788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are UU churches that consider<br/>\nthemselves *christian* and cater to an almost exclusive christian<br/>\ncongregation.  There is a UU church here in the dfw metroplex that considers<br/>\nitself a *pagan* UU church and so their congregation is almost exclusively<br/>\npagan.  There are UU churches like the one in San Antonio that are tolerant<br/>\nof *all* ways and welcome everyone and there are those that welcome everyone<br/>\n*except* mainstream christians because their congregation is so full of<br/>\nwounded former christians.  The UU church has it&#39;s roots in the Christian<br/>\nchurch.
