I checked and they HAD changed all my settings!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may remember when you signed up for a Yahoo ID and were asked by<br/>\nthem if you wished to receive any &quot;Special Offers & Marketing<br/>\nCommunications.&quot; Yahoo recently revised their privacy policy. As a<br/>\nresult, and regardless if you chose to receive any of these &quot;Special<br/>\nOffers&quot; or not when you signed up for your Yahoo ID, Yahoo have set<br/>\nevery single person who has a Yahoo ID (and those that have more than<br/>\none) to &quot;Yes&quot; in these preferences. This means that you may well be<br/>\ninundated with even more junk mail than you are already receiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to change your settings back to whatever you had them at<br/>\nbefore, you will need to log in to your account and physically change<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogin at the following URL - you will be prompted for your Yahoo ID<br/>\nand password:   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile\">http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe middle segment within the Member Information (email addresses)<br/>\nsection has a link to: Edit your marketing references. Click on this<br/>\nlink and you will see all of your settings were changed to &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>\nMeaning of course that you will receive all kinds of &quot;offers&quot; from<br/>\nYahoo and their &quot;partners.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you wish to receive even more junk mail than you are already<br/>\ngetting, you may wish to go through the entire page and choose<br/>\nwhether to receive such notices. Also, right at the bottom of the<br/>\npage are other ways you could be notified - by phone or postal mail.<br/>\nUnless you wish to receive unsolicited phone calls and paper junk<br/>\nmail, you will need to change these settings to &quot;No&quot; also.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have finished your selections, make sure you click on the<br/>\nSave Changes button right at the bottom of the page.<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo is supposedly sending out notices to all its users regarding<br/>\nthis particular change. However, it is estimated it will take<br/>\nseveral weeks for everyone to receive their notification. In the<br/>\nmeantime ... a considerable amount of marketing mail could be making<br/>\nits way to everyone&#39;s mail boxes. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33664,"nextTopicId":33194}}
