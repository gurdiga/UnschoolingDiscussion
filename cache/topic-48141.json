That she enjoys being around other <br/>\nkids, no matter what the age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Why do you feel you screwed up? Did you feel you should have exposed her <br/>\nto more children? I&#39;m just wondering if maybe the aloofness wasn&#39;t just a <br/>\npart of who Tara was when she was small. (I was like that myself, but I came <br/>\nfrom an abusive home - unfortunately I really was &#39;different&#39;.)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I do think me not really knowing &quot;what to do with a baby, toddler&quot; was a <br/>\nbig part of how her personality was shaped. I think it made her (Tara) <br/>\nharder when she &quot;had&quot; to go out in the world of school. (sorry for the dirty <br/>\nword!) Like I said I had no friends who had little children and didn&#39;t do <br/>\nsupport groups or playgroups or anything like that. She was always just with <br/>\nme and my mom. We went out almost every day but it was like shopping and <br/>\nstuff. Not really stuff a kid would like to do. Although Tara is a major <br/>\nshopper to this day!! And yes there is a part of me that believes a lot of <br/>\nit was just who Tara was, but I also believe that I instilled a lot more of <br/>\nthat in her.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with our 3 other children, I don&#39;t force child play or make play dates <br/>\neven once a week. But they have each other and play well. Being that they <br/>\nare 7, 6 and 2, it&#39;s a built in playdate every day. Plus I have been doing <br/>\nfun kid stuff with them from very early on. I do think it makes a very big <br/>\ndifference. Add that with my homeschooling support groups and field trips <br/>\nand park days, they get just enough and not too much for them. As they get <br/>\nolder, I figure they&#39;ll ask if they need more interaction. Tara never asked <br/>\nand just went from snobby I don&#39;t want to play with you kid to 12 year old <br/>\nknow it all wanna be 18.
