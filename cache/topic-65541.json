The first view being<br/>\nthat it&#39;s good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work<br/>\nthat they have accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The<br/>\nsecond view is that a child who is always praised will only do things<br/>\nto please adults rather than to please herself, to hear others talk<br/>\ngood about her.  Kiele looks for praise constantly although I do see<br/>\nthe pride that she takes in her work whether it&#39;s building with<br/>\nblocks or coloring a picture, however she looks for my approval to<br/>\nsee if I like what she has done.  I know that this is normal for a 4<br/>\nyear old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all the time<br/>\nfor everything that she does is good for her?

He&#39;s<br/>\n  also always been better at connecting with adults than kids his own<br/>\n  age.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you for your kind words. Funny how I couldn&#39;t think of focusing on<br/>\nher strong points.Guess i was feeling a bit funky.Molly is still trying to<br/>\nfind what she is good at. She has a sister (the hypersensitive one)who is<br/>\nmega quick and finds every activity easy and is noticed by others right away<br/>\nfor her immediate skill. Hard on Molly.Her sister does not rub this in at<br/>\nall but molly notices it none the less. We have been focusing on accepting<br/>\nherself for where she is at.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Has she always been unschooled?

This alone was social contact enough<br/>\nfor her. One girl is seeking her out .Molly is hesitant but we are working<br/>\non trying one visit and seeing how it goes. I am helping her with wording to<br/>\nmake the call.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Help her find her strengths and don&#39;t focus too much attention on her<br/>\n  weaker points.

Truthful<br/>\npraise, imho, can do no harm.  I also think there is such a thing as<br/>\noverdoing it, though.  For example, pulling out the bells and whistles for<br/>\n*every tiny little thing*.  &quot;WOW, you are the BEST child in the WHOLE ENTIRE<br/>\nWORLD&quot; is great here and there.  We over did those type of statements with<br/>\nour now 6 yr old and she went through quite a phase of letting EVERYONE know<br/>\njust how incredibly wonderful she was at any opportunity.  That tends to<br/>\nturn people off, even their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take every opportunity to tell my children when they are doing something<br/>\nright, nice, and so on.  &quot;Thanks for helping your sister with ________, that<br/>\nwas very nice of you.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you for _____ all by yourself!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven using gentle parenting techniques, it is so easy to pay more attention<br/>\nto the &#39;bad&#39; things.  I think the key is to *catch* our children being good<br/>\nand doing well and honestly comment on those things.  Offering unrealistic<br/>\npraise *can* be detrimental to a child who *may* grow up thinking they can<br/>\ndo no wrong.  There *may* also come a time, further down the road that they<br/>\nbecome fearful of sharing important situations or times of bad judgment in<br/>\nfear of what their parents might think of their *perfect* child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend whose parents treated her as if she were THE best child on<br/>\nearth.  She became pregnant at 14 and went to her choir teacher at school to<br/>\nconfide because she was so terrified of letting her parents down.  She truly<br/>\nbelieved that they thought she was perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to say this extreme situation is normal or even probable in<br/>\nevery circumstance.  I just think we owe it to our children to be honest<br/>\nwith them and let them know that we ARE proud of them for their<br/>\naccomplishments and will offer honest praise accordingly, but that they are<br/>\nalso allowed to make mistakes and that we will help them resolve their<br/>\nmistakes and still love them regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yr old made a rather large mistake recently and I calmly explained why<br/>\nI was upset.  A couple of days later, she wrote me a letter, apologizing,<br/>\nsuggesting a consequence very appropriate to the situation and offered an<br/>\nappropriate solution.  All on her own!  When I told her how proud of her I<br/>\nwas and how impressed I was and kept going, she finally stopped me and said,<br/>\n&quot;Goolleeee Mom, you don&#39;t have to over do it or I might do it again!&quot;  Of<br/>\ncourse, she was laughing but it was a wise lesson.

The first view being that it&#39;s<br/>\ngood for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have<br/>\naccomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a<br/>\nchild who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than<br/>\nto please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for<br/>\npraise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work<br/>\nwhether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks<br/>\nfor my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is<br/>\nnormal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all<br/>\nthe time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some<br/>\npointers on this I would appreciate it...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course when a child does something they are excited about, they want to<br/>\nshare and get a response back. One that will make them feel good. I also see<br/>\nthe point of how praising just everything isn&#39;t good either. I watch what I<br/>\nsay and how I say it. I make sure to comment on how much work it looks like<br/>\nwent into that picture they just did or how I love the way they used color.<br/>\nSomething else beside just &quot;oh isn&#39;t that lovely, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Making<br/>\nsure I praise the effort instead of just the picture. I think that makes a<br/>\nbig difference. Not just the result but the process to get there. I think<br/>\nthat helps so much with their self esteem and not always concentrating on<br/>\nwhether the end result will be to anyone else&#39;s satisfaction. I do this with<br/>\nall comments, or I should say I try on most. Even with something like<br/>\ncleaning up the playroom without me asking. Instead of just saying great<br/>\njob, I will comment on how nice it was to do that because they know it makes<br/>\nme feel good and how much time it took them and how organized everything<br/>\nlooks. Hope this helps some.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 9<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 20 Apr 2003 00:40:11 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;Mary&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Praise<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to add to my last post that if it&#39;s something my child did<br/>\ncreatively, like a picture or making up a game, I always ask them how they<br/>\nfeel about what they did.

He told them about the bed he&#39;s making.  We talked about<br/>\nmedieval tents (we&#39;ve discovered a new Viking tent design).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were no kids around.

Everything   I have learned about children in my own experiences,<br/>\ncoupled with my recent embracing of unschooling, has confirmed to me that<br/>\nthe<br/>\nMontessori method of preschool/daycare is the best alternative IF a parent<br/>\nhas to put thier child in an out of the home child care situation.  My neice<br/>\nand nephew go to a public Montessori school and they absolutely love it. If<br/>\nthey didnt go there, my sister would most likely homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we discussed Montessori methods, Anna said that she wants to have a<br/>\nMontessori preschool, and maybe even a Montessori  &quot;grade&quot; school, when she<br/>\ngrows up.  I am going to call our local Montessori school next week and see<br/>\nif she can volunteer.
