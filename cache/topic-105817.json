Usually it&#39;s been Christians who made the  wrong <br/>\nassumption.  I remember a few times in earlier days (*Prodigy and  AOL communications) <br/>\nsomeone would post a reprimand to the whole homeschooling  discussion about <br/>\nhow something or other wasn&#39;t what Christians should  do.  I think once someone <br/>\nhad used a horrible word like &quot;crap&quot; or  something (4 letter anglo saxon <br/>\nword, but not the big ones, just some little  kid word), and the other time it was <br/>\nabout letting kids watch some particular  R rated movie.   Someone (me or <br/>\nsomeone else) would say, &quot;Not all  homeschoolers are Christian and not all <br/>\nChristians agree with you,&quot; and one  time the comeback was wonderful.   It was even <br/>\nGREATER shock, and  something like &quot;Why would God call a non-Christian to <br/>\nhomeschool?&quot; or  something really twisted and convoluted and revealing.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut the belief is still out there, that homeschooling is something God  has <br/>\ncalled Christians to do.  There are still lots of moms who wish God  had NOT <br/>\ncalled Christians to homeschool, because they would prefer not  to.  Poor kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut it&#39;s worth being aware that the assumption is operational  among probably <br/>\nmillions of people in and out of &quot;the homeschooling  community&quot; (NOT a phrase <br/>\nI like or that makes much sense).<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and before anyone says this whole list is anti-Christian (which is  NOT <br/>\ntrue) just because I tell true stories when the issue comes up, I think  I&#39;ve <br/>\nclarified why I get cranky when Christians want to help (by providing  links to <br/>\nlessons or whatever) or to explain Christianity to us once again  (we know; <br/>\nreally).  After all these years, it&#39;s coming into focus on  this:  The kinds of <br/>\nChristians cited above (in the quote about flames)  discourage and disallow <br/>\nanalsis and questions (considering it &quot;flaming&quot; to  even ask why).  For the <br/>\nsake of discipline and unquestioning &quot;faith,&quot;  they not only disallow questions <br/>\nfrom children, but discourage real discussion  amongst themselves.  I was a <br/>\nvery thinking child in a very &quot;don&#39;t  question&quot; religion, and I remember the pain <br/>\nand frustration that stance  causes.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s antithecal to unschooling to create a still place where  <br/>\nquestions aren&#39;t asked and attitudes can&#39;t be criticized because it would be  the <br/>\nsins of disobedience and of lack of faith.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems people will choose to be &quot;obedient&quot; to what makes sense, if  they&#39;re <br/>\nliving by principles that make sense to them.  And I know people  can gain <br/>\nfaith in natural learning and in their children&#39;s intelligence and  goodness.  <br/>\nAnd I also know that this paragraph thusfar would be called a  really bad word <br/>\nby critical fundamentalist Christian readers and separatist  Christian <br/>\nhomeschoolers.  It&#39;s not a bad word outside their circles, but  inside the rhetorical <br/>\nwall of &quot;Christian homeschooling&quot; it&#39;s equal to Satanic,  and it&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;Humanist.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t define myself that way, but that way of thinking is condemned  by <br/>\nChristians.  It&#39;s probably the main reason given to why public schools  are evil <br/>\nand why God has called them all (those who feel called or who are  told they <br/>\nhave been called and believe it out of faith and obedience) to  hunker down <br/>\nwhere their kids are safe from evils.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor people who have the tape of another talk Richard Prywtowsky and I  did at <br/>\nHSC a while back, To Question or Not to Question:  That is the  Question... I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as Peaceful Parenting, but is it good  enough for me <br/>\nto get some more copies of before Live and Learn in  October?
