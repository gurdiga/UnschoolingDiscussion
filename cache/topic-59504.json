Of course I had been doing that, but your suggestion reminded me to try<br/>\nagain, and we (13 yo dd and myself) sat at the table and made a list. That<br/>\nseemed to help, because for the last weeks she&#39;s been happier and so am I.<br/>\nI also wanted to comment on the post about late readers (sorry, I&#39;ve<br/>\nforgotten who that was). The 13yo dd I mentioned above sounds alot like your<br/>\ndaughter-physical, creative and bright-and she didn&#39;t really read til she<br/>\nwas about 11. Yes, I&#39;m sure there was some damage to her self esteem, mostly<br/>\nfrom other children. I remember one girl in particular saying to her &quot;you<br/>\ncan&#39;t be in my play, coz you have to read...&quot; :-(  She could read words, but<br/>\nnot chapter books then. Now at 13 she&#39;s a voracious reader! I never really<br/>\nfigured out a way to &quot;help&quot; her, I was reading when I started 1st<br/>\ngrade,(which did not go over well with the teacher-I spent most of my school<br/>\nlife getting in trouble for reading books I hid under my desk! and I&#39;d get<br/>\nbusted because I&#39;d forget and laugh out loud during history class, or<br/>\nwhatever boring subject it was.), so I figured she&#39;d read when she was<br/>\nready. I have heard that when children are tested, later, you cannot<br/>\ndifferentiate the late from early readers.<br/>\n&quot;cigarette smoking, sitting on their butts Texas moms...&quot;<br/>\nI wish I had copied your exact quote, Sandra! it was brilliant, and I want<br/>\nyou to know that there&#39;s a Missouri version! I was raised, sort of, by one<br/>\nof those. I say sort of, because my sister and brothers and I like to say<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t raise us, we just grew up. Okay, I&#39;ll go back to lurking now.<br/>\nThanks to all of you for everything you do...<br/>\nRobyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 23, 2003 7:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3068<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I have given away so much stuff<br/>\nin the last couple of years and the house is still overflowing.  I struggle<br/>\nto find that balance between simplicity and frugal living.  One thing that<br/>\nhas helped me a little is to focus on MY stuff.  I have realized that it<br/>\nisn&#39;t fair to tell them what to keep or give away.  Also, STUFF keeps<br/>\nflowing into our house.  We simply do not have the space to continually<br/>\nacquire stuff without also eliminating stuff.  Help!!  I do get grumpy when<br/>\nevery surface in the house is covered.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want clutter away and stuff saved gone, you have to go through the<br/>\nstuff regularly. That is of course unless you actually want to be a packrat.<br/>\nMy dad was, my husband is and so is Tara. Tara saves shirts she no longer<br/>\nfits into just because Grandma or Aunt so and so gave it to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nStuff is always going to be coming into the house. But some stuff, after<br/>\nawhile, can go. Stuff like books and movies and games, well that stuff I<br/>\nalways keep because one never knows when someone won&#39;t find the urge to<br/>\nwatch or do or play. But other toys and clothes that aren&#39;t worn and things<br/>\nold saved because they were just put away and forgotten about, I get rid of.<br/>\nI go through clothes closets every 3 months and get rid of whatever doesn&#39;t<br/>\nfit well or hasn&#39;t been worn since I went through it the last time. I have<br/>\nthe kids go through their stuff once a year in Oct. That&#39;s when our church<br/>\nhas their bazaar and takes donations of everything. It also gives the kids a<br/>\nchance to sort through things and make room for Christmas! They like the<br/>\nwhole donation idea too. Sometimes things are put aside at other times and<br/>\nif we have enough, we donate to other organizations also.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to keep up on my husbands stuff too but only really have success with<br/>\nis clothes. I must also say here that the kids stuff is always by their<br/>\nchoice. I never talk them into getting rid of anything. I wish I could talk<br/>\nmy husband into it though. He saves everything. I regularly go through his<br/>\nstuff and just throw out receipts and wrappings from things he bought. I<br/>\nthink he could easily be one of those people you see on TV who can&#39;t get rid<br/>\nof anything. (only half kidding here!) The only boxes of anything in this<br/>\nhouse not used is my husbands. It&#39;s the only way I can deal with his stuff.<br/>\nPut in it a box and maybe in 2 years he&#39;ll go through it. No boxes of<br/>\nanything else not being played with or used for decorations at one time or<br/>\nanother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy stuff is a bare minimum. Only what I use and a few keepsakes. I do have<br/>\none small stuff of baby things from when all the kids were little.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 5<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2003 12:53:41 -0800<br/>\n   From: &quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Re: this list has forced me again<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, is that what those long, round things in the closet are for?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want him to be able to open his<br/>\n&gt; closet door and use the clothes rack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 6<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2003 16:19:27 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephanie.elms@...\">stephanie.elms@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Re: this list has forced me again<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My kids have a whole cupboard in the playroom of stuff like<br/>\n&gt; that.

And I mean he really actually helps...he helps me unload the entire<br/>\ncar<br/>\nwhen we food shop, he loves to dust, he loves to help me make the bed and<br/>\nthe other day when we were folding clothes he wanted to learn how to fold<br/>\nshirts.<br/>\nIt just cracks me up and is so cute. I have told dh that I have decided that<br/>\nKyle<br/>\nand he should have full responsibility for keeping the house clean since it<br/>\nis<br/>\nin their genes...that Jason and I should be exempt since it just isn&#39;t in<br/>\nour nature.<br/>\n:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 8<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2003 16:19:27 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephanie.elms@...\">stephanie.elms@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Even though I had nothing to do with this post, I sure could<br/>\n&gt; use someone good<br/>\n&gt; at cleaning so your post made me think ME, ME, ME!

I jsut joined and I know I&#39;m supposed to lurk for a while and see if<br/>\nthis is where I belong but I&#39;m already sure that it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy immediate concern is the fact that I have a 10 year old who is still<br/>\nnot reading.  I am hanging on by my fingernails waiting for the<br/>\nlightning bolt of compregension to hit her.  She knows &quot;how&quot; to read (ie<br/>\nshe can sound out words and recognize a few on their own) but she<br/>\nsteadfastly refuses to spend any time really getting comfortable with<br/>\nit.  She LOVES to be read to.  She is outrageously creative<br/>\nartistically.  She enjoys physical persuits (karate, fencing, biking<br/>\nswimming...).  I know this kids wants to read btu she wants the magic<br/>\nwand method of learning and I can&#39;t find it.  My concern is that her<br/>\nself esteem is now getting involved.  Other people assume that she can<br/>\nread and it is going to get increasingly difficult to cover the fact<br/>\nthat she can&#39;t (or more accurately, won&#39;t).  Of course this pushes all<br/>\nmy buttons because one of my issues on the self-improvement front is to<br/>\nlet go of others&#39; expectations.  AARGH&gt;  This is such a tough place to<br/>\nbe in.  I want her to maintain all her self confidence but I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto teach her to cave to the expectations of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are all saved from further rambling by a crying baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA for any advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 23<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 23 Feb 2003 20:55:21 EST<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: Intro and advice request<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 2/23/03 6:39:00 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rickshei@...\">rickshei@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Other people assume that she can<br/>\nread and it is going to get increasingly difficult to cover the fact<br/>\nthat she can&#39;t (or more accurately, won&#39;t).  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she could she would.<br/>\nIf she could she couldn&#39;t help it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly turned 11 in November.
