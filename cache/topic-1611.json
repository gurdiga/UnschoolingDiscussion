We went up in 400 ft tower and viewed the entire <br/>\nbattlefield.  We went on a 2 hour bus tour with a guide that described the <br/>\nwhole battle for us.  We drove the battelfield ourselves and got out of the <br/>\ncar and stood on some momentous spots in history.  We stood right on the ver <br/>\nspot where General Reynolds (Union) felll as he led the Iron Brigade on an <br/>\nattack on the edge of what is now called Reynold&#39;s Woods.  We took a 2 hour <br/>\ntrain ride during which the Confederate Army took over the train and held us <br/>\nprisoner!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you walked down the streets, many people were dressed in period costume <br/>\nand answering questions from the public.  We saw a house with over 150 bullet <br/>\nholes in it fired by the federal army at a confederate sharpshooter in an <br/>\nupper window.  We drove past a house where a cannon ball was still lodged on <br/>\nthe side of it.  We saw a barn were a cannon ball was shot clear through it, <br/>\nliterally, you could see straight through the barn to the otherside!  We saw <br/>\nthe home of Jenny Wade, the only civilian casulty in Gettysburg.  She was <br/>\nmaking bread in her kitchen when she was hit in the back by a stray federal <br/>\nbullet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe re-enactments were really something.  I even began to cry.  I am very <br/>\nsensitive and really get wrapped up in things that I see.  I feel things very <br/>\ndeeply.  The sounds of the cannons and guns, the soldiers yelling out <br/>\ncommands, the men falling to the ground.  All very emotionally moving.  I <br/>\nwould encourage anyone who has a chance to see a re-enactment to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the cemetary was very humbling and saddening.  We saw the spot where <br/>\nLincoln had given the Gettyburg Address dedicating the cemetary in memorium <br/>\nof the soldiers who fell there.  We were too tired to walk up and touch it by <br/>\nthat time :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nNow how is that for studying history!!!!!  I never learned that much about <br/>\nGettysburg in school!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got back home we rented the movie &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and got goosebumps <br/>\nwhen we saw the soldiers standing and fighting, and living where we had stood <br/>\njust a couple of days before.  And TLC and the History channle ran segments <br/>\non the Battle of Gettysburg for a couple of weeks after.  That just <br/>\nenthralled us even more.  And the boys were more readily willing to watch the <br/>\nmovie and segments after we had actually been there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were there on the actual dates of the battle, July 2 & 3, 1999.  the <br/>\nbattle was over three days, July 1,2, & 3, 1863.  So the town was done up and <br/>\nready to re-live its past.  So many of the homes there now were there during <br/>\nthe Civil War.  And I, as an architecture freak, had a hayday just looking at <br/>\nthe houses and buildings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a wonderful memory and good knowledge we now have!  I will definitely <br/>\nhit the road more this year to live and learn history on the road (the best <br/>\nway i think).<br/>\n<br/>\nKim in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1618,"nextTopicId":1617}}
