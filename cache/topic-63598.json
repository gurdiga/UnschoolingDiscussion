She has been the source<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of many issues and therapists for both me and another sister of mine. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did was to make each of my parents a card (on Mother&#39;s Day and<br/>\nFather&#39;s Day) that just told them all the things I appreciated about the way<br/>\nthey raised me. All the things I was grateful for. Of course, there&#39;s things<br/>\nI don&#39;t agree with in their raising of me, but that&#39;s not the point. They<br/>\nboth really loved me and did what they thought was best. My mom breastfed me<br/>\nin the 60&#39;s, my dad took me to the park to fly kites. That kind of thing. It<br/>\nwas really fun for me to remember all of that. I also think it helped my<br/>\nparents to see that just because I choose to parent differently isn&#39;t a<br/>\ncondemnation of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, later, when my mom started interfering with my parenting, I turned to<br/>\nher one day and said &quot;You had your chance as a parent, and the result is me.<br/>\nOnly you can judge if that was successful or not &lt;grin&gt;. Now it&#39;s my turn to<br/>\nparent, and I&#39;m going to do some things differently. You can support me, you<br/>\ncan disagree with me (in your head, but not verbally in front of my kids),<br/>\nor you can stay away from the grandkids.&quot; Those were, quite seriously, the<br/>\noptions. I&#39;m not going to spend my life unschooling only to have my parents<br/>\ntry to shame my kids for not knowing their ABCs by age 3 or how to read by<br/>\n6. Fortunately, it never came to that. That conversation was early on in the<br/>\nprocess and it completely headed things off. I think my parents both know I<br/>\nvalue them, but that DH and I have to decide what&#39;s right for our family.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The things is that...I don&#39;t know... it seems as if I am failing. I have<br/>\nheard that it is not important for a child to read, or forced to read at 5,<br/>\nI have a friend was a former public school teacher who homeschools her<br/>\nchildren, tell me the same thing. Just go by when they are ready. But when<br/>\nyou have a mother who insists on this MUST be done by such and such an<br/>\nage.....can you sense some issues here with me, lol.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s really hard. I&#39;ve seen mothers struggle with these kinds of issues on<br/>\nmany fronts - childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. I have been at births (as a<br/>\ndoula) where the laboring mom&#39;s mother was telling her she wouldn&#39;t be able<br/>\nto have the baby without drugs. Fear is such a huge thing, and I think it<br/>\nhelps to acknowledge that the fear of the (older) parent is largely coming<br/>\nfrom love. That doesn&#39;t make it productive though. Sometimes it&#39;s best to<br/>\njust get away from it. In the case of birth, I&#39;ve seen midwives ask the<br/>\nmother to leave the room because her fear was interfering with the birth.<br/>\nYou can see it in real-time in birth, but in something like unschooling it&#39;s<br/>\nso much more prolonged and harder to see. But that fear can still interfere.<br/>\nI&#39;d say do what you can do to either get your mom to shut up, or get away<br/>\nfrom her fear. It might be coming from a place of love, but it can be<br/>\npoisonous.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32,"nextTopicId":63655}}
