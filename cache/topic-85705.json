I do appreciate it...and all <br/>\nothers that have given advice)<br/>\n.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I guess I don&#39;t truly understand this cardboard box idea - especially for<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the child who has been asking for a real violin consistently for the last<br/>\ntwo years.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\nWell... I know for a fact my dd would not go for a &quot;box&quot;... ( she&#39;s made many <br/>\nalready herself over the years&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;). That might be appropriate if <br/>\n&quot;I&quot; was to suggest she learn violin...but not now , when she is so passionate <br/>\nabout it on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;As for the china analogy, Jayn has several tea sets. Some are china. She<br/>\n </span></blockquote>also has a number of fragile china dolls. She knows they are breakable and<br/>\nplays with them accordingly. Some have had broken limbs from accidents, and<br/>\nI have repaired them.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n This reminds me...Chloe asked for a Nativity set for Christmas last year<br/>\n( age 4)...she wanted her very own. <br/>\n   I hard a hard time finding a child&#39;s one..so I got her a &quot;china one&quot;. She <br/>\nwas so very careful and treated it with the utmost respect. Now and then I did <br/>\nhave to glue on hands that fell off by accident &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;. <br/>\nChildren ARE very capable beings.<br/>\n<br/>\n I can&#39;t wait to see those blue eyes on Christmas morning...wide-eyed and <br/>\nspeechless no doubt &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marcia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85678,"nextTopicId":85702}}
