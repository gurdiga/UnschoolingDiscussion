After a while the visits were too expensive and the kids weren&#39;t <br/>\nliking the long plane rides.  So some of our free quarterly family visits we <br/>\nbypassed.  He got to come home monthly, and so used to work ten hour days so <br/>\nhe could have a full week and two weekends home.  So my view of Minnesota, <br/>\nalthought sampled throughout three years, was still as a New Mexican visiting <br/>\nfor a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48745,"nextTopicId":48811}}
