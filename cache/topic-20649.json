Many of you know that I have an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eldest son with many challenges that make him a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; daily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; struggle to raise.  I am not certain from whence<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his problems stem, but we know that he has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agression<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and anger management issues, patience and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attention<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; span limitations, self control problems and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; explosive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eczema,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opposite of) and that we are wonderful parents<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like the worst kind of miserable failure with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My son right now is four and a half years old and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are struggling daily with the issue of potty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; training.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can sympathise with Eileen, in her quest to deal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a child with no fear of danger, as I had one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  He has, thankfully, finally learned some fear of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; danger situations and I don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; running in the street anymore, much.  But believe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he used to.  He is also very, VERY physically<br/>\n&gt; &gt; active,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and was crawling at 4 months (!) and walking (well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; running) at 8 months.  At the time he was walking,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was several months into a complicated, extremely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problematic pregnancy.  I was sick a lot, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not carry him near as much as I would have liked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thomas has no fear of strangers and goes with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anyone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thomas likes to run and hide from us in public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; places,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or just run from us period.  Thomas likes to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; constantly challenge and push his limits, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reverify<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the rules, over and over and over.

Many of you know that I have an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; eldest son with many challenges that make him a<br/>\n&gt; daily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; struggle to raise.  I am not certain from whence<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his problems stem, but we know that he has<br/>\n&gt; agression<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and anger management issues, patience and<br/>\n&gt; attention<br/>\n&gt; &gt; span limitations, self control problems and<br/>\n&gt; explosive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma,<br/>\n&gt; eczema,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; opposite of) and that we are wonderful parents<br/>\n&gt; doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; our best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like the worst kind of miserable failure with<br/>\n&gt; him).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My son right now is four and a half years old and<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are struggling daily with the issue of potty<br/>\n&gt; training.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I can sympathise with Eileen, in her quest to deal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a child with no fear of danger, as I had one<br/>\n&gt; too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  He has, thankfully, finally learned some fear of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; danger situations and I don&#39;t have to worry about<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running in the street anymore, much.  But believe<br/>\n&gt; me,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he used to.  He is also very, VERY physically<br/>\n&gt; active,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and was crawling at 4 months (!) and walking (well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running) at 8 months.  At the time he was walking,<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was several months into a complicated, extremely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; problematic pregnancy.  I was sick a lot, and<br/>\n&gt; could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not carry him near as much as I would have liked.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thomas has no fear of strangers and goes with<br/>\n&gt; anyone.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thomas likes to run and hide from us in public<br/>\n&gt; places,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or just run from us period.

Many of you know that I have an<br/>\n&gt; eldest son with many challenges that make him a daily<br/>\n&gt; struggle to raise.  I am not certain from whence all<br/>\n&gt; his problems stem, but we know that he has agression<br/>\n&gt; and anger management issues, patience and attention<br/>\n&gt; span limitations, self control problems and explosive<br/>\n&gt; emotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma, eczema,<br/>\n&gt; and other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>\n&gt; sometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>\n&gt; charming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that we<br/>\n&gt; are models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>\n&gt; opposite of) and that we are wonderful parents doing<br/>\n&gt; our best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>\n&gt; like the worst kind of miserable failure with him).<br/>\n&gt; My son right now is four and a half years old and we<br/>\n&gt; are struggling daily with the issue of potty training.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can sympathise with Eileen, in her quest to deal<br/>\n&gt; with a child with no fear of danger, as I had one too.<br/>\n&gt;  He has, thankfully, finally learned some fear of<br/>\n&gt; danger situations and I don&#39;t have to worry about him<br/>\n&gt; running in the street anymore, much.  But believe me,<br/>\n&gt; he used to.  He is also very, VERY physically active,<br/>\n&gt; and was crawling at 4 months (!) and walking (well<br/>\n&gt; running) at 8 months.  At the time he was walking, I<br/>\n&gt; was several months into a complicated, extremely<br/>\n&gt; problematic pregnancy.  I was sick a lot, and could<br/>\n&gt; not carry him near as much as I would have liked.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thomas has no fear of strangers and goes with anyone.<br/>\n&gt; Thomas likes to run and hide from us in public places,<br/>\n&gt; or just run from us period.  Thomas likes to<br/>\n&gt; constantly challenge and push his limits, and reverify<br/>\n&gt; the rules, over and over and over.  Thomas imitates<br/>\n&gt; what he sees on tv and what other people say and do,<br/>\n&gt; with uncanny precision, including innappropriate<br/>\n&gt; behavior.  Thomas LOVES girls, and likes to chase and<br/>\n&gt; pester them in public places, taking innappropriate<br/>\n&gt; liberties with touching, etc, with people he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When Thomas was a toddler, he was not allowed to walk<br/>\n&gt; anywhere in public, as he always ran away from us.<br/>\n&gt; Since I could not carry him, he was always strapped<br/>\n&gt; tightly into his stroller or a shopping cart.  Those<br/>\n&gt; were the rules, period.  If he didn&#39;t want to be in a<br/>\n&gt; cart or his stroller (and believe me, we had plenty of<br/>\n&gt; battles over it) we didn&#39;t go.  I spent a lot of time<br/>\n&gt; at home his first three years, particularly when his<br/>\n&gt; brother was born (Thomas was 15 months old) and I was<br/>\n&gt; recovering from the pregnancy from hell with no<br/>\n&gt; friends or relatives in a three state radius.  I am<br/>\n&gt; not a proponent of leashes or harnesses and will not<br/>\n&gt; use them.  Thomas DID run in the streets, parking<br/>\n&gt; lots, towards rivers, stray animals, hot stoves, etc.<br/>\n&gt; The times I was not able to catch him we were able to<br/>\n&gt; get away with just a few scars to remember the<br/>\n&gt; incident, thankfully.  But I had many heartstopping<br/>\n&gt; moments in his &quot;running boy&quot; days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He is FINALLY old enough to stay (mostly) with us when<br/>\n&gt; we go out, and we have been able to get rid of the<br/>\n&gt; hated strollers.  Now we have challenges with him in<br/>\n&gt; other areas, and I struggle daily with MY OWN anger<br/>\n&gt; management and controlling the urge to hit.  He&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; type of kid that can be a pure joy at times, and at<br/>\n&gt; other times, makes childless people thank their lucky<br/>\n&gt; stars that they never had kids.  I am thankful every<br/>\n&gt; day that I can get through with him that I keep my<br/>\n&gt; temper, and I am miserable every day that I lose my<br/>\n&gt; temper.  Even though it might get his attention where<br/>\n&gt; many, many other methods have failed, I will never<br/>\n&gt; feel that hitting my child is an answer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Eileen, I am not attacking you, so don&#39;t feel like you<br/>\n&gt; have to defend yourself.

The<br/>\n&gt; decision to &quot;draw your line at &#39;no violence, never<br/>\n&gt; hitting a child&#39;&quot; is held up as the gold standard<br/>\n&gt; which should not be set aside for any reason, even if<br/>\n&gt; the &#39;creative&#39; lengths to which one must go in order<br/>\n&gt; to avoid doing so are effectively more abusive and<br/>\n&gt; damaging to the psyche of a particular child than the<br/>\n&gt; hitting itself.  The theory, in effect, becomes more<br/>\n&gt; important than the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you wildly misunderstood my post, as I can think of no other reason<br/>\nfor the above paragraph and the long diatribe that follows it. What I<br/>\nstated, and what I stand by (which was, incidentally, in response to Lynda&#39;s<br/>\npost and not yours) is that there is no such position as &quot;live and let live&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;whatever works for you&quot; with regards to this subject. Whether or not<br/>\nthey want to admit it, everyone has a line somewhere in their head that they<br/>\nhave drawn. That line might be &quot;No violence, no coercion, no restraint,<br/>\never&quot; or that line might be &quot;No physical violence&quot; or it might be &quot;a light<br/>\nsmack on the bottom is OK&quot; or that line might be &quot;A spanking with my hand<br/>\nbut not with anything else&quot; or it might be &quot;A good whipping does a child<br/>\ngood&quot;, but *everyone* has a line. I must sincerely doubt that anyone on this<br/>\nlist would say &quot;Well, whatever works for you&quot; to a parent who insisted (as<br/>\nin my previous example) that scalding a child with hot water was necessary<br/>\nto teach them about stove safety. This is a ridiculous example of course<br/>\n(though sadly, probably not one that some parent somewhere has not done),<br/>\nbut it is to illustrate the point - we all have our boundaries. Arguing that<br/>\none person is superior to another because they are more open-minded about<br/>\nspanking is IMHO misguided. We all have our boundaries, they are just in<br/>\ndifferent places. Given that we have boundaries, and given that we all judge<br/>\nthe *acts* that other parents might take (I, for instance, wouldn&#39;t hesitate<br/>\nto call CPS on a parent I thought was truly abusing their child, if I<br/>\nthought it was in the child&#39;s best interests), I think the best we can do is<br/>\ntry not to judge other *people* though we may judge their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By your framing of the argument, you would have me<br/>\n&gt; taking the position that a small amount of violence is<br/>\n&gt; not harmful to my, or any, child.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t have you take any position. I would have you hold to your own<br/>\nbeliefs and I to mine and each freely have the right to state what we<br/>\nbelieve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That is not a<br/>\n&gt; position that I could, or would ever wish to, defend.<br/>\n&gt; My position, my experience, my observation, is that a<br/>\n&gt; small amount of violence is unavoidable in many...<br/>\n&gt; probably most... children&#39;s lives<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is probably true. But I thought the issue at hand is whether or not the<br/>\nparent inflicts that violence. I think there&#39;s most likely a big difference<br/>\nin a child&#39;s mind between something happening to them and their parents<br/>\ndoing something to them. I was hit by a baseball bat and knocked unconscious<br/>\nas a child, but that is an entirely different issue in my mind than the<br/>\ntimes my parents spanked me.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;long rant about immunizations snipped&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can *any* of you guarantee that you haven&#39;t done some<br/>\n&gt; unknown violence or irreparable damage to your child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; future by any action or decision you have made?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure none of us can, life doesn&#39;t work that way. But again that seems<br/>\nsort of irrelevant to this discussion. The discussion was about whether or<br/>\nnot specific corporal punishment was a) effective, b) caused psychological<br/>\nharm, and c) was necessary, and in fact, you yourself asked for input,<br/>\nsaying &quot;what is your solution for it...?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would<br/>\n&gt; you want a Majority to tell you that you have<br/>\n&gt; ignorantly and callously played Russian Roulette with<br/>\n&gt; your child&#39;s life?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh heck, they do it all the time. Any parent who breastfeeds a toddler or<br/>\nsleeps with their kids or homeschools for that matter has probably heard<br/>\nthese things a million times. If you really believe that what you are doing<br/>\nis right, why would it matter what random other people think?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Would you feel comfortable in<br/>\n&gt; saying that very thing to other people on this list<br/>\n&gt; about the immunization, educational, religious,<br/>\n&gt; sexual, tv/computer, Ritalin issues, among others?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d definitely feel comfortable stating my opinion on any of these subjects<br/>\nif I had one.  And I&#39;d hope to feel comfortable listening to other people&#39;s<br/>\nopinions, even if I didn&#39;t agree with them, just to see if I could glean<br/>\nsome bit that would be useful and/or applicable in my own life.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone on this list has stated that anyone else has<br/>\n&quot;ignorantly and callously played Russian Roulette with your child&#39;s life&quot;<br/>\nabout *any* subject that I&#39;ve read about here. I think people have talked<br/>\nabout their opinions about actions, unless I missed something, no-one has<br/>\ndirectly accused anyone else of such a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You are too vulnerable that way.  BUT<br/>\n&gt; you *are* comfortable in applying an inflexible,<br/>\n&gt; simplistic and virtuous-sounding generality in judging<br/>\n&gt; a small minority who are un-PC or independent enough<br/>\n&gt; to see things differently than the Majority.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmmm, I&#39;m wondering here if the &quot;you&quot; who you are speaking to is<br/>\nspecifically me, as the post seems to be directed at me (with my post in<br/>\nquotes) or if this is a more generic &quot;you&quot;. If it is the former, I&#39;d<br/>\nchallenge you to find any post in this thread where I personally judged any<br/>\n*person* for something I disagreed with. Yes, I strongly disagree with<br/>\nhitting children and I said &quot;There are always options, other than violence&quot;<br/>\nwhich I believe to be a true statement. I dislike the act and that is where<br/>\nmy own personal line is drawn. I don&#39;t judge other people however. Heaven<br/>\nknows, I&#39;ve made enough mistakes in my own relatively short parenting career<br/>\nto know that everyone does things they wish they hadn&#39;t done and says things<br/>\nthey wish they hadn&#39;t said. I don&#39;t, however, defend them as being the right<br/>\nthing to do. I should hope that on this list we can always discuss *actions*<br/>\nwithout getting down to specific judgements on *people* as you seem to have<br/>\ndone here in this post (by repeated use of the word &quot;you&quot; followed by all<br/>\nsorts of outrageous statements.).<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) inventer of new and wonderful things<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) singer of protest songs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Eileen M.","from":"&quot;Eileen M.&quot; &lt;ravensegg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"19hd_4xxr6NbTePnNDTu2rdxPlAZGYXHADLgOTZWzEq6BJN6o_5ZgT6HYtDqjLAX8oZIztEmL-g4yWmSa2hA-yJMtJO9pvaK","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Disciplining toddlers","postDate":"989441035","msgId":20959,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNTA5MjA0MzU1LjM1NjQzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEwMjAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwNTA5MTYzMTQ5LjU3OTAzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20924,"nextInTopic":20971,"prevInTime":20958,"nextInTime":20960,"topicId":20649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t feel attacked at all... and your son does sound very like mine was at the time, at least in some respects.

Many of you know that I have an<br/>\neldest son with many challenges that make him a daily<br/>\nstruggle to raise.  I am not certain from whence all<br/>\nhis problems stem, but we know that he has agression<br/>\nand anger management issues, patience and attention<br/>\nspan limitations, self control problems and explosive<br/>\nemotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma, eczema,<br/>\nand other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>\nsometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>\ncharming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that we<br/>\nare models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>\nopposite of) and that we are wonderful parents doing<br/>\nour best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>\nlike the worst kind of miserable failure with him). <br/>\nMy son right now is four and a half years old and we<br/>\nare struggling daily with the issue of potty training.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can sympathise with Eileen, in her quest to deal<br/>\nwith a child with no fear of danger, as I had one too.<br/>\n He has, thankfully, finally learned some fear of<br/>\ndanger situations and I don&#39;t have to worry about him<br/>\nrunning in the street anymore, much.  But believe me,<br/>\nhe used to.  He is also very, VERY physically active,<br/>\nand was crawling at 4 months (!) and walking (well<br/>\nrunning) at 8 months.  At the time he was walking, I<br/>\nwas several months into a complicated, extremely<br/>\nproblematic pregnancy.  I was sick a lot, and could<br/>\nnot carry him near as much as I would have liked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas has no fear of strangers and goes with anyone. <br/>\nThomas likes to run and hide from us in public places,<br/>\nor just run from us period.  Thomas likes to<br/>\nconstantly challenge and push his limits, and reverify<br/>\nthe rules, over and over and over.  Thomas imitates<br/>\nwhat he sees on tv and what other people say and do,<br/>\nwith uncanny precision, including innappropriate<br/>\nbehavior.  Thomas LOVES girls, and likes to chase and<br/>\npester them in public places, taking innappropriate<br/>\nliberties with touching, etc, with people he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Thomas was a toddler, he was not allowed to walk<br/>\nanywhere in public, as he always ran away from us. <br/>\nSince I could not carry him, he was always strapped<br/>\ntightly into his stroller or a shopping cart.  Those<br/>\nwere the rules, period.  If he didn&#39;t want to be in a<br/>\ncart or his stroller (and believe me, we had plenty of<br/>\nbattles over it) we didn&#39;t go.  I spent a lot of time<br/>\nat home his first three years, particularly when his<br/>\nbrother was born (Thomas was 15 months old) and I was<br/>\nrecovering from the pregnancy from hell with no<br/>\nfriends or relatives in a three state radius.  I am<br/>\nnot a proponent of leashes or harnesses and will not<br/>\nuse them.  Thomas DID run in the streets, parking<br/>\nlots, towards rivers, stray animals, hot stoves, etc. <br/>\nThe times I was not able to catch him we were able to<br/>\nget away with just a few scars to remember the<br/>\nincident, thankfully.  But I had many heartstopping<br/>\nmoments in his &quot;running boy&quot; days.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is FINALLY old enough to stay (mostly) with us when<br/>\nwe go out, and we have been able to get rid of the<br/>\nhated strollers.  Now we have challenges with him in<br/>\nother areas, and I struggle daily with MY OWN anger<br/>\nmanagement and controlling the urge to hit.  He&#39;s the<br/>\ntype of kid that can be a pure joy at times, and at<br/>\nother times, makes childless people thank their lucky<br/>\nstars that they never had kids.  I am thankful every<br/>\nday that I can get through with him that I keep my<br/>\ntemper, and I am miserable every day that I lose my<br/>\ntemper.  Even though it might get his attention where<br/>\nmany, many other methods have failed, I will never<br/>\nfeel that hitting my child is an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nEileen, I am not attacking you, so don&#39;t feel like you<br/>\nhave to defend yourself.  I am just sharing my<br/>\npersonal experience as the Mother of a boy who sounds<br/>\nsimilar to yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I have decided to<br/>\npull him from school rather than trying to medicate<br/>\nhim so that he can function there.

I mean, one can &quot;shop<br/>\naround&quot; for a definition that will fill the bill if one wants to really play<br/>\nword games but the most commonly shown definition is &quot;exertion of physical<br/>\nforce(s) so as to INJURE&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can just as easily find as many ways to define that sicky sweet voice some<br/>\nfolks use to &quot;talk&quot; to their children when they are young and they &quot;explain&quot;<br/>\nthings to them as abuse, brainwashing, coercion, duress . . .

It *hurts* to bite my tongue that<br/>\n&gt; hard.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What is difficult for me to understand is that so many<br/>\n&gt; people on this *particular* list feel perfectly<br/>\n&gt; comfortable in telling others where the line should be<br/>\n&gt; drawn, and that any other than *their* line is wrong,<br/>\n&gt; abusive, that it will permanently damage our<br/>\n&gt; children... not that it could possibly do so, or<br/>\n&gt; potentially do so, but that it *will*.  Robin, at<br/>\n&gt; least, is TRYING to be fair and impartial.  Sort of.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is possible to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand that some folks feel that a small amount<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of violence is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; harmful to their kids. It is also possible to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand that others feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quite strongly that any amount of violence is too<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much for any child.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My, my...  What an unusual, and apparantly<br/>\n&gt; irresistable, position for homeschoolers to be in.<br/>\n&gt; You have managed to become a Moral Majority!  The<br/>\n&gt; decision to &quot;draw your line at &#39;no violence, never<br/>\n&gt; hitting a child&#39;&quot; is held up as the gold standard<br/>\n&gt; which should not be set aside for any reason, even if<br/>\n&gt; the &#39;creative&#39; lengths to which one must go in order<br/>\n&gt; to avoid doing so are effectively more abusive and<br/>\n&gt; damaging to the psyche of a particular child than the<br/>\n&gt; hitting itself.  The theory, in effect, becomes more<br/>\n&gt; important than the child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And who can blame you for taking such a seemingly<br/>\n&gt; reasonable position?  To do otherwise, after all,<br/>\n&gt; would be to take the icky position that it is okay to<br/>\n&gt; do violence to your child.  THAT wouldn&#39;t be... well,<br/>\n&gt; it wouldn&#39;t be nice.  It wouldn&#39;t be morally<br/>\n&gt; unassailable.  It wouldn&#39;t be Superior.  It would<br/>\n&gt; leave room for self-doubt and discomfort and even<br/>\n&gt; pain.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By your framing of the argument, you would have me<br/>\n&gt; taking the position that a small amount of violence is<br/>\n&gt; not harmful to my, or any, child.  That is not a<br/>\n&gt; position that I could, or would ever wish to, defend.<br/>\n&gt; My position, my experience, my observation, is that a<br/>\n&gt; small amount of violence is unavoidable in many...<br/>\n&gt; probably most... children&#39;s lives, and that most<br/>\n&gt; parents have to make a choice between one kind and<br/>\n&gt; another on occasion.  We are forced by circumstances<br/>\n&gt; beyond our control to estimate the potential level of<br/>\n&gt; violence and/or damage inherent in each option and<br/>\n&gt; choose the one that, to the best they can measure,<br/>\n&gt; will do the least damage or can most reasonably be<br/>\n&gt; mitigated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most of you have done so already.  You have assessed<br/>\n&gt; the risks in either immunizing or not immunizing your<br/>\n&gt; children; if your risk pays off, you go on your way<br/>\n&gt; happy and carefree... but if you assessed incorrectly,<br/>\n&gt; you have done irreparable harm to your children and<br/>\n&gt; possibly to your community.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you chose to immunize your child, that needle was<br/>\n&gt; far more violent than my swat of my son&#39;s bottom...<br/>\n&gt; few of us whose child has been stuck with a big ol&#39;<br/>\n&gt; needle can claim that we are ignorant of the vast<br/>\n&gt; sense of betrayal and personal offense our children<br/>\n&gt; feel at that moment.  It is projected directly at you,<br/>\n&gt; in great big (loud!) Offront Waves.  You chose to do<br/>\n&gt; violence to your child because your assessment of the<br/>\n&gt; situation led you to believe that it was a *smaller*<br/>\n&gt; and mitigatable damage compared to the possible<br/>\n&gt; alternative.  But what if your child later is<br/>\n&gt; diagnosed with a neurological disorder... will you<br/>\n&gt; ever be sure that that small violence didn&#39;t have far<br/>\n&gt; reaching consequences?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ah, perhaps you chose not to immunize!  You were able<br/>\n&gt; to virtuously avoid that small violence *and* avoid<br/>\n&gt; the whiff of insidious long-term damage that seems to<br/>\n&gt; be floating into connection with the immunizations.<br/>\n&gt; THAT is definitely the Right choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But what if they get the disease because they were<br/>\n&gt; left unprotected?  What if they are rendered impotent<br/>\n&gt; and are never able to have children of their own?<br/>\n&gt; What if they are left paralyzed or deaf or blind?<br/>\n&gt; What if they are left unable to speak or recognize us<br/>\n&gt; or feed themselves, what if they *die*?  I personally<br/>\n&gt; have seen the last two happen, right here in the<br/>\n&gt; Metropolitan area in which I live.  What if our<br/>\n&gt; beloved children, and similarly unimmunized<br/>\n&gt; compatriots, are responsible for the spreading of a<br/>\n&gt; devastating epidemic?

It is projected directly at you,<br/>\n  in great big (loud!) Offront Waves.  You chose to do<br/>\n  violence to your child because your assessment of the<br/>\n  situation led you to believe that it was a *smaller*<br/>\n  and mitigatable damage compared to the possible<br/>\n  alternative.

I apologize again if there is anything I have said that has <br/>\noffended you; that was not my intention.  I don&#39;t believe (not positive about <br/>\nthis) that you were even the one who brought up the spanking issue.

I believe that most people initially responded to that.  <br/>\n     I have known a lot of people over the years, including many who spanked <br/>\ntheir kids, and it has not been my experience that those spankings were <br/>\nunavoidable.

And I believe there are many ways I have <br/>\nbeen with my kids in the past that could have been so much better.  <br/>\n     What you have experienced is much different and much harder than most of <br/>\nus will ever have to deal with, as you well know.

BUT<br/>\nyou *are* comfortable in applying an inflexible,<br/>\nsimplistic and virtuous-sounding generality in judging<br/>\na small minority who are un-PC or independent enough<br/>\nto see things differently than the Majority.  You are<br/>\ncomfortable with applying that one-size-fits-all<br/>\nmeasuring stick for &#39;violence&#39; to all children and<br/>\nfamilies, no matter how different *their* experience<br/>\nmight be from your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMust be comfy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- DiamondAir &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nIf<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you draw your line at &quot;no<br/>\n&gt; violence, never hitting a child&quot; then you will be as<br/>\n&gt; creative as you need to<br/>\n&gt; be to avoid doing that.

It was the shock of the timing and<br/>\nthe tone of my voice that made him sit for a moment<br/>\nand roar with indignation... because I had never<br/>\ntouched him in anything but a playful or cuddly manner<br/>\nbefore, and it was a very unpleasant surprise.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t enjoy it, and neither did he, but it saved us<br/>\nboth from much worse possibilities in the future.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery child is different, of course, and other mothers<br/>\nmay find other tactics more effective.  I would<br/>\nencourage them to try less unpleasant methods of<br/>\ninstruction first, as I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nEileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Until a child is old enough to understand that large<br/>\nmoving object means danger for small bodies, WE (the adults) have to be<br/>\nresponsible for their safety. If that means holding their hand, or having<br/>\nthem  in a sling, or carrying them, or strapping them firmly into a<br/>\nstroller, so be it - even IF they are unhappy about it temporarily - they<br/>\ncan be free to run as soon as they are out of danger. Other options are to<br/>\nminimize errands and situations where the child is near a street or parking<br/>\nlot until they are old enough to understand. Eventually, they learn safety<br/>\nand can take personal responsibility for their own safety. Believe me when I<br/>\nsay that this happens naturally (as with all other learning) and that<br/>\nspanking is not necessary to bring the lesson home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my own kids, I&#39;ve always preferred using the sling for the toddler<br/>\nyears.
