His radical position is that children<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; automatically know how and what to learn, that they&#39;re born with the<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; knowledge of how to get nonsense.  The proper methods of developing<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s own intellect have to be learned just like any other knowledge,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and having a teacher to guide the process is of significant value.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; (See Objective Approach.) A parent who insists that a child must lead<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; his own education places an undue burden upon his young shoulders.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Children do not yet have a broad enough context to see how knowledge<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; fits together; they donÂ’t mysteriously &quot;know&quot; what they can&#39;t possibly<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; know.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm\">http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>These sound a lot like the ideas Gail Withrow publishes on her website.

Meera, by the way, is doing just fine!  She is an<br/>\nextremely talented gymnast (spends about 20 hours a week at the gym),<br/>\nhas taught herself to play the flute at an extremely high level, is<br/>\ncurrently working her way through Mozart&#39;s 23rd Piano Concerto, and<br/>\noccasionally (though only occasionally) opens a book.  She reads well!<br/>\nit&#39;s just that she has decided she has better things to do with her<br/>\ntime!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning of the year, Meera started taking band with the local<br/>\n5th grade.  About the 5th week in, the teacher decided she should teach<br/>\nthe other kids (she herself had never had even a single lesson) -- well,<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t allow this to go on very long, got her moved to 6th grade<br/>\nband, where she is bored, and stays in with promises that she&#39;ll be in<br/>\nthe 8th grade band next year.  (she&#39;s only 9)  Meanwhile, she may have<br/>\nbeen the only kid in Washington state enrolled in recess! Recess<br/>\nfollowed band, and she wanted to go to the schoolyard with her friends,<br/>\nso they made us enroll her (allows the school district to capture<br/>\nrevenue! and they think it helps them with liability, though I can&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out how.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, my younger is very different from my older one, but the way we go<br/>\nabout meeting her learning aspirations does not differ in any<br/>\nsubstantive way.  My wife no longer delivers newspapers (she&#39;s still a<br/>\nmassage therapist) -- she now cares intermittently for Alzheimer&#39;s<br/>\npatients in their homes, and has lots of fascinating information to<br/>\nbring home!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; overall i felt it was honest and fascinating, especially your ability<br/>\n&gt; to utilizes your community because this is an area i am very weak<br/>\n&gt; at.   but when you have a child whose interests lay well outside your<br/>\n&gt; own, in your case music and in mine robotics, looking toward the<br/>\n&gt; community would be the next logically step.  i think you covered the<br/>\n&gt; &#39;how to&#39; part very well and you showed just how exciting life can be<br/>\n&gt; when a family embrace learning as a lifestyle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!

This<br/>\nmade<br/>\n&gt; me laugh out loud!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think &#39;patiently&#39; refers better to the parent who allows his / her child<br/>\nthe<br/>\nspace to come to activity on their own. I have never seen an unschooled<br/>\nchild<br/>\n(and rarely a schooled child) who has an &#39;inclination to be inert&#39;. This<br/>\ndescription would only apply to a child who had had all initiative beaten<br/>\nout of<br/>\nthem (literally or figuratively) by adults. Non-action is not necessarily<br/>\ninertness or laziness. Some people are thinkers, and some take a lot longer<br/>\nto<br/>\nget through thinking. I don&#39;t believe it is possible to know what is<br/>\nhappenning<br/>\ninside someone else&#39;s head. You ask a kid &#39;what are you thinking about?&#39; and<br/>\ns/he answers &#39;nothing&#39;, you may think s/he is being lazy or inert, I would<br/>\nassume that they didn&#39;t want to talk to me about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, a &#39;bored&#39; child left alone to be bored (still talk to them<br/>\nbut<br/>\ndon&#39;t nag), trusted to come through, will eventually burst forth in activity<br/>\nand<br/>\ncreativity, often into a totally new interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO it is, yet again, a matter of trusting our children - and being able to<br/>\nkeep<br/>\ntrusting, sometimes for a looong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 10<br/>\n   Date: Mon, 17 Apr 2000 18:28:41 -0400<br/>\n   From: &quot;A.

Very shy children have high<br/>\nattachment needs which need to be met.  I have stopped (mostly)<br/>\n&quot;encouraging&quot; my children to be &quot;independent&quot;.  You can&#39;t stop<br/>\nindependence when they are ready for it which occurs much later than<br/>\nmost people think.  Late adolescence is the time for the natural<br/>\nemergence of true independence.  Independence is forced on children<br/>\nentirely too early which results not in independence but &quot;peer<br/>\nidentified&quot; children with displaced dependence on their peers who are<br/>\nill equipped to meet their real needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was subscribed to this list many months ago but unsubscribed because<br/>\nmy family needed my time more than I needed this list.

A great raft of accepted notions<br/>\nwhich have ZERO validity are bandied about with much quoting of<br/>\nstatistics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES! &quot;Education&quot; is about making money, enforcing<br/>\nvalues, stifling questioning, ensuring conformity, destroying the<br/>\ninherent love of learning, detaching children from their families,<br/>\ninsuring that armies have willing solidiers, protecting the power of the<br/>\npowerful. To silently witness this discussion is like being ensnared in<br/>\na nightmare/dream. Schooling is little better than wholesale<br/>\nincarceration of the young.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach day of freedom is bright with promise. Boredom when you are free is<br/>\nthe matrix of creativity. When you are imprisoned boredom is the<br/>\ncauldron in which cruelty boils. Schools are rife with bullies because<br/>\nthey are run by well-meaning bullies who are oblivious to the fact that<br/>\ntheir function is to bully. Just as in a prison, the powerful control<br/>\nthe less powerful right down the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that people may have good intentions but I just can&#39;t stand the<br/>\nhollowness of this discussion. I know that iconoclasm is only popular if<br/>\nit is not your icon being thwacked. }<br/>\n<br/>\nI post this here because arguing with a schooled, schooling teacher is<br/>\nmaddening to say the least.<br/>\nsusan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -unschoolers are lazy and don&#39;t discipline their children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -unschoolers are chaotic and are anit-rules just to be anti-rules<br/>\n&gt; they have no deeper reasons. i.e. unschoolers are contrary and<br/>\n&gt; non-conformist for it&#39;s own sake.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; here&#39;s a website that really annoyed me because it passes opinion off<br/>\n&gt; as fact.  i think it will provide you with lots of &#39;fallacies&#39;.  the<br/>\n&gt; author happens to be on our local list and i had a very brief<br/>\n&gt; interaction but quickly realized (and was advised) it was a waste of<br/>\n&gt; time because she needed to defending &#39;teaching&#39; by attacking<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  imo this is a really silly thing to do.  anyway here are<br/>\n&gt; some excerpts and links to check out for yourself:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1)   Unschooling in Theory ...<br/>\n&gt; John Holt&#39;s philosophy of unschooling is based on a false premise: the<br/>\n&gt; premise that ideas are innate. His radical position is that children<br/>\n&gt; automatically know how and what to learn, that they&#39;re born with the<br/>\n&gt; knowledge of how to get nonsense.  The proper methods of developing<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s own intellect have to be learned just like any other knowledge,<br/>\n&gt; and having a teacher to guide the process is of significant value.<br/>\n&gt; (See Objective Approach.) A parent who insists that a child must lead<br/>\n&gt; his own education places an undue burden upon his young shoulders.<br/>\n&gt; Children do not yet have a broad enough context to see how knowledge<br/>\n&gt; fits together; they don&#39;t mysteriously &quot;know&quot; what they can&#39;t possibly<br/>\n&gt; know.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm\">http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; imo:  the burden, placed on children, of parents who lack faith in a<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s ability and desires is the true burden.   and the fallacy is<br/>\n&gt; that unschooling parent don&#39;t facilitate the &#39;fitting together of<br/>\n&gt; knowledge&#39;.  which leads to the denial that children question the<br/>\n&gt; world around them and that these questions led to the experience of<br/>\n&gt; &#39;how knowledge fits together&#39; and these experiences, if not discovery<br/>\n&gt; naturally but the child, are provided and facilitated by the parents.<br/>\n&gt; unschooling parents and their children choose a lifestyle of learning<br/>\n&gt; and thereby don&#39;t make a distinction between life and teaching.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  2)   Unschooling is:  Anti-schooling...<br/>\n&gt; John Holt&#39;s advice to unschooling parents from Teach Your Own (p. 229)<br/>\n&gt; sums up his theory in practice:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I say, above all else, don&#39;t let your home become [a] miniature copy<br/>\n&gt; of the school. No lesson plans! No quizzes! No tests! No report cards!<br/>\n&gt; Even leaving your children alone would be better; at least they could<br/>\n&gt; figure out some things on their<br/>\n&gt; own. Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much<br/>\n&gt; as you can.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In other words, let the child be responsible for his own education.<br/>\n&gt; You parents don&#39;t have to do anything-don&#39;t plan a curriculum, don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; try to evaluate your child&#39;s progress, don&#39;t try to teach him. Just<br/>\n&gt; leave him alone to learn from life.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm\">http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; imo: i don&#39;t know how you can &#39;live together&#39; and then &#39;leave your<br/>\n&gt; [kids} alone&#39;.  and the point that life-learners are people who have<br/>\n&gt; developed the skills of self-motivation and curiosity is completely<br/>\n&gt; lost in this &#39;interpretation&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; overall this author exhibits a need, for whatever reason, to have<br/>\n&gt; control over her children and their learning process, yet is not<br/>\n&gt; secure enough in this position to just do it, but must support the<br/>\n&gt; position by negating the possibility that there is a way where a child<br/>\n&gt; can learn and not be controlled.  imo we as parents need faith in<br/>\n&gt; ourselves as well as our children and this is perhaps the toughest<br/>\n&gt; hurdle presented by unschooling - obviously this author was unable to<br/>\n&gt; make this &#39;leap of faith&#39; and perhaps should follow a different<br/>\n&gt; philosophy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -susan,<br/>\n&gt; austin,tx<br/>\n&gt; &#39;unity through diversity&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolr2@...\">unschoolr2@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi all, I am working on an article on the common myths or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; misconceptions<br/>\n&gt;&gt; about unschooling and unschooling families.

He<br/>\n&gt; believes shyness is a positive naturally occurring quality in children<br/>\n&gt; which is instinctive and promotes attachment of children to their<br/>\n&gt; parents.  He recognizes that there are large variances of shyness but<br/>\n&gt; he sees it as an important force for focusing children on the people<br/>\n&gt; who care about them.

And if your child can do well on the testing<br/>\nthe services give, they will find a way to enlist the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hjshaltz@...\">hjshaltz@...</a><br/>\nHJS Studio and Shaltz Farm Shetlands and Angora Rabbits<br/>\nList Mom, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberFlock@onelist.com\">FiberFlock@onelist.com</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberProfessionals@onelist.com\">FiberProfessionals@onelist.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan","from":"susan &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"owpVw7BsEC52F2s9Q8WjDjtVOpPb0-ykwwNaezPazci5EXYox-aJtzEwA5utpSdh7RQgZYzll5Nz0NNtggHNdTQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 517","postDate":"956055988","msgId":8248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4RkM0MUFBLjdCNTVGRTc1QGZsYXNoLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGMwLjJiZWZhMmUuMjYyZGQ4MzlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":8246,"nextInTopic":8254,"prevInTime":8247,"nextInTime":8249,"topicId":8242,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"betsy you re right that s her.  i just thought she was a great example of fallacies regarding unschoolers.  i see her as the rush limbaugh of hsers - she s a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1170491586\">betsy you&#39;re right that&#39;s her.  i just thought she was a great example of<br/>\nfallacies regarding unschoolers.  i see her as the &#39;rush limbaugh&#39; of hsers -<br/>\nshe&#39;s a verbal bully.   there&#39;s no point of discussing it with her because<br/>\nit&#39;s her way or forget it.  she blinded by her own opinion and regards it as<br/>\ntruth.   i&#39;ve not met her just had a brief conversation w her online in our<br/>\nlocal group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; These sound a lot like the ideas Gail Withrow publishes on her website.
