At those times,<br/>\nI say no when the kids ask to go with me.  It is my choice because it is<br/>\nmy body that I am taking to the store and because taking care of the kids<br/>\nat the store would be my responsibility.  Part of learning about life is<br/>\nlearning that the answer to every request is not always yes.  I think<br/>\nit&#39;s important to be honest.  If I don&#39;t want to take them and I say no,<br/>\nbut then changed my mind because they pleaded or something,  I might feel<br/>\ncoerced and resentful of my loss of peace.  So I say choice is coupled<br/>\nwith responsibility.  Whoever has the burden of responsibility is the one<br/>\nwho gets the choice.  If my children said they wanted to go to the store<br/>\nahead of time, so I could make a choice ahead of time and not last<br/>\nminute, it would probably help, because then I could be planning on that<br/>\ninstead of planning on some peace and quiet.  Then I wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>\ndisappointed.  So then they are being considerate and learning people<br/>\nskills.  Actually, I usually take them and am glad to because they are so<br/>\nwonderful I hate being away from them.  What I&#39;m trying to say is,<br/>\nsometimes the parent needs to think about his or her own needs first, and<br/>\nthe child&#39;s needs are secondary, because how can you care for your child<br/>\nif you&#39;re not caring for yourself first?<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24560,"nextTopicId":25059}}
