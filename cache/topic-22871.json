So, if I do it the church-related way and do it through <br/>\n an academy, do I have to attend the academy/church? Because if I do <br/>\n then I can&#39;t do it. For this one academy, Family Christian Academy, <br/>\n it says that if we &quot;join&quot; them that she doesn&#39;t have to have a <br/>\n degree, so that&#39;s why we thought that was the only way. The only <br/>\n problems with homeschooling we&#39;ve run into so far are expenses and <br/>\n her not having a BA/BS degree. If you could help it would mean so <br/>\n much.

Even in PA. a very stringent state <br/>\nallows unschooling. Maybe yours does too or you could work around it. I do <br/>\nnot have my college degree either and I unschool my dd. I did attend 3 years <br/>\nbut even if I hadn&#39;t I would still feel very comfortable w/ my choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22867,"nextTopicId":22873}}
