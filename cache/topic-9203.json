Gulp. She decided to take a bus all the way across country to save some money, then she&#39;ll start the Amtrak portion of the trip after staying with a friend in Eugene, OR, for a couple weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe got her hostel card today and bought a neat little bag to keep things in. Also dyed her hair red (really a dark auburn). She&#39;s alternately excited and kinda irritable--a little nervous, I suspect, but still gung ho.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I remembered who used to send out The Barrage--it was Inknote! I wonder if she&#39;s still around....<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9201,"nextTopicId":9181}}
