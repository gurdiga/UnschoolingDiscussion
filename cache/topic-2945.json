So she asked me for advice on homeschooling ASAP!  Well, I sent<br/>\nher Mississippi (where they just moved - Collinsville - anybody there?)<br/>\nstate laws (I got it off the unschooling.com website), and I promised to<br/>\nsort through some essays for her and pick out a few that would be most<br/>\nhelpful to them in their situation.  Well, I was looking for a certain<br/>\nessay - the one that &quot;converted&quot; me (sounds like a religion, doesn&#39;t it<br/>\n- I guess in a way, maybe it is).  I don&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t remember who wrote it.  It was about a family with a lot of kids<br/>\n(I think at least four) and they asked Mom to homeschool them, and so<br/>\nshe did.  She talks about how they teach themselves, and they have a lot<br/>\nof land.  She says they have to spend money for school taxes anyway and<br/>\nshe&#39;d rather spend it on the kids.  Um, she also says that the school<br/>\nauthorities leave her alone - that testing is wrong and they know it. <br/>\nOh boy.  I wish I could remember it better.  I thought I had kept it,<br/>\nbut I can&#39;t find it.  Perhaps I&#39;m misquoting, but if anybody can lead me<br/>\nto it, I&#39;d be very grateful.
