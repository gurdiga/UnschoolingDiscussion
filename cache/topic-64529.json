Hoping that maybe <br/>\nthis one answered question will be the &#39;click&#39; that&#39;ll put <br/>\neverything in place and offer more security in embarking on the <br/>\nunschooling adventure.

Sort of manipulating the answer so it <br/>\nfits the question.  That combined with the need to feel special.  It <br/>\nall points to our insecurities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTanya</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"learning about unschooling","postDate":"1050179482","msgId":64529,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2LjJjNzVkZGE4LjJiYzlkMTlhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":90706,"prevInTime":64528,"nextInTime":64530,"topicId":64529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/12/03 12:18:18 PM, PHDRWD@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1206687282\">In a message dated 4/12/03 12:18:18 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PHDRWD@...\">PHDRWD@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;d love a wonderful place to learn about unschooling, I just wish I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to wade through so much (what I view as) extraneous discussion!
