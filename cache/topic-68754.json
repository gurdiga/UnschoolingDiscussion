I didn&#39;t have to wait a month! I just told her that today<br/>\nshe could choose what she wanted to do and if I could help her at all let me<br/>\nknow.  She was a little suspicous at first and even asked if this included<br/>\nnot doing math.  So I got busy doing something and I see that she is typing<br/>\nfuriously at the computer.  After a while I casually walk over to see what&#39;s<br/>\nup and she is on the sixth page of a movie script!!  And it was pretty good<br/>\ntoo....several characters and neat story line.  PLUS she can type a heck of<br/>\na lot faster than I can. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nAnd I took the little guy to the library and just followed him around.  He<br/>\nskipped the kid section and found encylopedia type picture books on<br/>\nfreshwater fish.  He just had to get those!  And some Magic School Bus<br/>\nvideos.<br/>\nSo I guess there is something to this unschooling stuff! &lt;bwg&gt;  I am so<br/>\nthankful for all your posts and encouragement.  I&#39;ll be reading!...<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68469,"nextTopicId":68757}}
