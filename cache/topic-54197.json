If there&#39;s something you like about<br/>\nthe philosophy you should ask questions and think about it and decide for<br/>\nyourself if it will work for your goals. But you shouldn&#39;t expect me to<br/>\ncompromise my beliefs (or others to compromise their beleifs) so you can<br/>\nhave easy access to other points of view.**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAwesome, Joyce.  You really laid out clearly what has been a sticky<br/>\npoint on this list many times.  I think this paragraph is a keeper.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54196,"nextTopicId":54203}}
