Nineteen years ago<br/>\nwhen I went abroad to live in Germany, I would have never thought I would<br/>\nwitness reunification in my lifetime.  I daresay many of the Germans I met<br/>\nfelt the same way.  What an amazing sequence of events unfolded before our<br/>\nvery eyes; a testament to the fact that regimes can fall; that average<br/>\npeople can make a huge difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we wrap up the 20th century, we can look back at the fall of the Berlin<br/>\nWall in 1989, Perestroika in the former Soviet Union, and the reunification<br/>\nof Germany as among the most significant events in our lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy picks for the three most important years of the 20th century are 1918,<br/>\n1945, and 1989.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  1918     WWI ends, and the excessively punitive Versailles Treaty sows<br/>\nthe seeds of WWII.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  1945     WWII ends, beginning of the Atomic Age, the carving up of<br/>\nGermany, and other events which led to the establishment of the &quot;Iron<br/>\nCurtain, the Cold War, and the communist takeover of China.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  1989     fall of the Berlin Wall, end of the Cold War.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your picks for the three most important years of the 20th century?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\n&quot;Lessons From a Coal Furnace&quot;<br/>\nSometimes old furnaces give us more than just a cozy warm cottage.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=46175\">http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_article.gsp?c_id=46175</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Say all you have to say in the fewest possible words, or your reader will<br/>\nbe sure to skip<br/>\nthem; and in the plainest possible words, or he will certainly misunderstand<br/>\nthem.&quot;--John Ruskin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13564,"nextTopicId":13482}}
