This <br/>\nmakes it hard, susan, for me to find &#39;fun&#39; in housework, never mind <br/>\nshow the kids the &#39;fun.&#39;  Comes partly of not liking the place you <br/>\nlive, either i think.  but that&#39;s definitely my problem.   btw I was <br/>\nwalking home with the kids tonight, in front of my house were 2 <br/>\nsets of neighbours having a good old chin-wag.  they barely <br/>\nacknowledged me.  Both send their kids to the nearby nursery that <br/>\nhas a dangerous trampoline outside.  hmmm...  Sometimes i relly <br/>\ndislike living here :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy (who wanted a smallholding to raise alpacas for wool...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 18 Jul 2000, at 9:11, Michelle Harper wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi All......Vote takes it....No on the moderator..now on to other<br/>\n&gt; stuff.........We have 3 dogs, 2 cats 2 birds, and 2 fish(one really<br/>\n&gt; big one)...Zain waters , and feeds the dogs about 3 x a week..the<br/>\n&gt; doggy that lives outside, everyday.
