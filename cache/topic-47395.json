That was done.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I can&#39;t understand that, maybe I just don&#39;t understand this group, but it seems to me the police should be the first notified in a sexual abuse case. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So you think if one person hits one child once, it&#39;s nobody else&#39;s business.  <br/>\n  And if one person hits SEVERAL children it&#39;s no worse?  Or if that one child <br/>\n  is hit repeatedly and often, it&#39;s still nobody else&#39;s business?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** No, I think it is their family and friend&#39;s business, not strangers who have no idea if it has happened once, to more than one child, or whathaveyou. Unless it is clearly abuse (as defined by law) and then they should be called. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I KNOW you have said several times today that it&#39;s nobody else&#39;s business <br/>\n  what happens within a family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Unless it is abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your children will not always be with you, and I doubt that they are always <br/>\n  with you now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Why would you doubt it? I said it, I don&#39;t lie. The ONLY times I&#39;ve been anywhere without them is when I go Christmas shopping - one day, once a year, and when I go out for my anniversary - one evening a year, and I think I&#39;ve missed about half our years on that. Otherwise, at least one, and usually all three, children are with me. Yes, even at night and on bathroom trips and trips to the mailbox. <br/>\n<br/>\n  How can you tell when you see &quot;family interactions&quot; that they&#39;re family?<br/>\n  If you would be responsible and compassionate in the absence of your children <br/>\n  but would turn your eyes away from abuse if they were there, what message <br/>\n  does that send them?  What example does it set?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** What right do I have to decide if a lady and child are family or not? If a child is with a parental figure, I would certainly assume they&#39;re family, or someone the family entrusted to be with the child, which makes them as close as family. I wouldn&#39;t do nothing.... they&#39;d learn how and when to call 911 and they&#39;d learn that I&#39;d protect them from possible harm in getting involved in a dangerous situation. You&#39;d rather I charge in on drunk men holding a baby with two small children tagging behind??? Just to show them a &quot;good example&quot;??? What&#39;s that example gonna mean if they&#39;re dead? <br/>\n<br/>\n  If others are hitting little children, it&#39;s not courage to allow it to <br/>\n  happen, it is the purest cowardice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** You can&#39;t allow or not allow it to happen when they&#39;re not your children or even family or friends. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The mother didn&#39;t need help.  Her whipping was going just peachy for her.  <br/>\n  The little girl needed help.  That&#39;s the person I helped.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** So you dont&#39; think the mother needed to be helped learn a better way? I thought that&#39;s why you spoke to begin with. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Repeatedly.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Nope, I stand by my original statements. <br/>\n<br/>\n  This is coming from someone who clung doggedly (while contradicting herself <br/>\n  in that discussion too) that calling a child &quot;Lazybones&quot; could do no harm. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I did ask nicely for that to be dropped. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you offend the neighbors, sometimes you answer to the neighbors.  If my <br/>\n  child plays at another family&#39;s house, how they treat her and their own <br/>\n  children while she&#39;s there becomes my business.  If they come and visit my <br/>\n  house and belittle their children or swat them in MY house, on MY property, <br/>\n  that becomes my business.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** True. But what&#39;s that got to do with how stranger&#39;s parent? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Now I&#39;d like to ask you to reconsider whether spanking is abusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** By law, it&#39;s not. Personally, I&#39;m still considering. <br/>\n<br/>\n  If you&#39;re not open to encouragement, then why would you come to a discussion <br/>\n  group such as this?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I am very open to encouragement. If I need opinions on something, I ask. If I run across something that I&#39;m interested in or that seems to have something to do with our lives, I listen and learn. I am wondering what that has to do with encouraging/offering parents help instead of forcing it. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The manager called the cops while Cathyn  pulled the man off her and I sat <br/>\n  with her while she cried.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You would have called the cops and let them keep fighting until they got <br/>\n  there? Because that small, older woman was going to lose that fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Good! Then she wanted help, or she would&#39;ve refused to stay with you. Hope she got away from him for good. <br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Part 2 of 2, calling the police vs. doing nothing","postDate":"1035335075","msgId":47395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhMi5hODc2ZjlhLjJhZTc0ZmEzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47407,"prevInTime":47394,"nextInTime":47396,"topicId":47395,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/22/02 1:50:28 PM, myrandab@bellsouth.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-336609715\">In a message dated 10/22/02 1:50:28 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:myrandab@...\">myrandab@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   ** OK, I&#39;m confused.
