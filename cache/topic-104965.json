As a family, <br/>\nwe are very active and personally I know that I feel better <br/>\nemotionally and eat way better when I stay active. When I am really <br/>\nin active training (I do triathlons in the summer), I almost *can&#39;t* <br/>\neat sweet foods. They no longer taste good to me. It&#39;s very odd <br/>\n(since usually I love my ice cream and chocolate!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things we do over the course of the week:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Homeschool gymnastics day (we rent out a big gymnastics place and <br/>\nthe kids have the run of it)<br/>\n- Bicycling - if we go somewhere, we often bicycle. Both of my kids <br/>\n(8 & 5) have been bicycling with me for years (we have a kid&#39;s <br/>\ntandem attachment) and even my daughter (5) can go 7 or 8 miles on <br/>\nher little 1-speed bike<br/>\n- Walking - we have a little corner market we can walk down to. <br/>\nOften if the weather is nice, we sit out and eat a popsicle or I <br/>\nread the comics to them from the paper<br/>\n- Swimming - we made a commitment to do at least one family swim <br/>\nnight a week. We often take some of the kids&#39; friends along and they <br/>\nall have a blast. They can easily spend an hour or two in the pool.<br/>\n- Mini-trampoline - we just have one of these in the house, for <br/>\nwhenever the kids want to use it<br/>\n- Kids&#39; track meets and fun runs. Well, we do live in &quot;Track Town <br/>\nUSA&quot; so we are lucky there. There are lots of kids runs and the <br/>\nlocal track club sponsors a kids&#39; track meet once a week in the <br/>\nsummer. They use the big real stadium at Hayward Field where greats <br/>\nlike Steve Prefontaine have competed and they can do any of the <br/>\ntrack and field events they want.<br/>\n- Just getting out and playing. Often we&#39;ll take gloves, mitts, and <br/>\nbats out to the cul-de-sac, or a soccer ball, or chalk and mark out <br/>\na hopscotch game, or just go swing on the swings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are all things we love to do and do for fun, so the kids stay <br/>\npretty active most of the time. Of course, they also have plenty of <br/>\nindoor time and activities too. I think when kids feel active and <br/>\nstrong and healthy, it&#39;s great for their emotional health and also <br/>\nthey tend to eat healthily to fuel their bodies. <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197352701,"authorName":"Kirk and Susan","from":"Kirk and Susan &lt;kirkandsusan@...&gt;","profile":"mom2zacluk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Food choices","postDate":"1111931807","msgId":104965,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyNDZCQjlGLjIwOTA2MDNAY2hhcnRlci5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104967,"prevInTime":104964,"nextInTime":104966,"topicId":104965,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here here to Karen and her advice on portions....That is how I lost and still am losing/maintaining my weight after the last baby (4 years ago).

That and exercise.  Heidi, you said you were undermoving, maybe <br/>\nyou and your Daughter could find some form of exercise to do together.  <br/>\nMy boys (8 and 4) try to do some &quot;exercise&quot; everyday to &quot;keep our hearts <br/>\nhealthy&quot;.  Right now my older son is really into Yoga which probably <br/>\nisn&#39;t doing his heart any good, but it is beneficial in other ways...Is <br/>\nthere any chance your daughter is eating because of emotional reasons?  <br/>\nBored, stressed, lonely, anxious?  My 4 year old will eat carrots and <br/>\nyogurt all day and leave the cookies to his brother.  But even the 8 <br/>\nyear old leaves those for fruits and peanut butter most of the time, so <br/>\nwhile I say I have an open kitchen policy, our choices are also <br/>\nmostly&quot;healthy&quot; choices....certainly the ones within reach...and so far <br/>\nI haven&#39;t had to be concerned about what they are eating...just to let <br/>\nyou know from what point of view I am coming....<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104966,"nextTopicId":104961}}
