With all the email support available to me, I often forget about unschooling.info.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Our 3 yod, Loryn, has a diagnosis of autism, and I&#39;ve been struggling with family members (not my dh, though), who feel I should pursue S/L therapy through the school system.  Loryn doesn&#39;t speak at all, really.  There is some repetition from videos (Baby Einstein) and tv there, but only rare &quot;authentic&quot; speech from her, and usually just 1-2 words at a time.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The thing is:  various family members (well, Mom, really, but also step-brother, in-laws, Granny, etc.) have almost convinced me to try a special ed Pre-K program (through our PS system, of course).  They&#39;ve started to see Loryn as &quot;flawed&quot;, and that she needs to be &quot;fixed&quot; (not the words they&#39;re using, obviously, but what *I&#39;m* hearing, internally). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We&#39;ve only been radically unschooling for the past year or so (so still &quot;newbies&quot;, IMO), but I have embraced the unschooling philosophy with every fiber of my being, and to remarkable results within our family.  My concern is that, in disregarding ANYthing that looks like &quot;school&quot;, could I be closing doors to people/places/things that may be of help to Loryn?  And exactly WHO determines when and why a child should speak, when Loryn communicates using her own ways (some signing, mostly chirps, babbling, smiles, tugging a hand to pull someone to something she wants, etc.).  She LOVES to count, and amazes us with her drawing, counting out loud, etc., so I know she picks up on all kinds of things just by being around us, she just doesn&#39;t feel the need to communicate in &quot;typical&quot; ways.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  To shed a little more light, Loryn&#39;s older sister Ashlyn has high-functioning autism.  She had some speech delay, but not to the same extent as Loryn, and went to this same special ed Pre-K program that I&#39;m thinking about for Lolo.  My feeling about Ashlyn&#39;s (almost) year in the program is that it didn&#39;t do much to help her, but it didn&#39;t delay her in anyway either.  It seems that she was the &quot;model&quot; for others in the class, which didn&#39;t benefit her (or the other students, IMO) much.  The teacher who oversees the program is a really good teacher, who &quot;gets&quot; her kids, so I trust that Loryn would be in a &quot;safe&quot; place, as long as Gayle was still head teacher of the class. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;d love to get some feedback from you all.  Meanwhile, I&#39;ll just go back to a little *light* reading! LOL<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks, and happy New Year!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Paige in Virginia <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
