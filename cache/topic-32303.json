Her goat is due to kid any<br/>\nday now and we have all learned the signs of impending labor...and are<br/>\nmaking the poor goat extremely paranoid by following her around, staring at<br/>\nher all the time  :)  Adriane and Zach (8) spent most of yesterday making<br/>\ndecorative signs for all the bedroom doors.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach is big into objects in motion through space.  He golfs, shoots a BB<br/>\ngun, rides a scooter and bike off ramps, etc..  We found an injured bird the<br/>\nother day and he spent a morning making toys to put in the cage with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarsie (5) is trying to learn to read and figured out several sight words<br/>\nand is able to recognize those words within other words, like &quot;no&quot; is in<br/>\n&quot;nothing&quot;.  She likes to paint, play dress up, make huge messes, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nDanny (3) and Michelle (2) are more into television than the other kids.<br/>\nThey like Dora the Explorer and Veggie Tales, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have very few rules around here.  The kids watch all and any television<br/>\nthey want.  Currently all the kids are upstairs playing together.  They eat<br/>\nwhatever they want.  For lunch today, they requested yogurt and fruit.  Only<br/>\none takes a nap or has a quiet time and he says he &quot;loves naps&quot;.  Later<br/>\ntoday some homeschool kids are coming over to play, then we are off to<br/>\ngymnastics and baseball.  After dinner, Adriane and Zach will finish their<br/>\nsewing projects that they entered in the county fair where they are also<br/>\nshowing their rabbits.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32300,"nextTopicId":32313}}
