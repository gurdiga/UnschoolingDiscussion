He is trying to find his own way, <br/>\nand more than likely from the sounds of it, he silently appreciates you <br/>\n&quot;being there&quot; but doesn&#39;t want your help right now. Kind of like when they are <br/>\nbabies and they are just beginning to walk, they don&#39;t want to hold your hand, but <br/>\nthey keep checking to see how far they can go and still be able to trust you <br/>\nwill be there if they fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a doubt in my mind that no matter how old he is now, your baby is <br/>\nsimply transitioning into manhood. And even if he refuses to talk about this <br/>\nstuff with you, do you really believe that his not sharing with you is a <br/>\nreflection on you? Maybe if you can just realize all you have done for him and all <br/>\nhe has learned without ever being &quot;taught&quot; you can rest assured that he is <br/>\ngoing to be just fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as bookwork goes, let him decide. Again his choice is not a reflection <br/>\nof you, it&#39;s just him finding his own way. He may be inamorate (sp?) with <br/>\n&quot;doing&quot; schooly stuff right now, but you have raised a free thinker and I am sure <br/>\nhe will continue to grow while traveling his own new roads.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are a fine mother Tia, please don&#39;t feel anything otherwise.

So I follow him around a bit until he<br/>\nsits down.  I sit down across the table.  He picks up the newspaper and<br/>\nstarts reading.

So I pick<br/>\nup a magazine and start looking at it.  &quot;Whatcha doin&#39;?&quot;  &quot;Reading a<br/>\nmagazine&quot;  &quot;Oh&quot;.

I don&#39;t even *want* to talk about schoolwork,<br/>\nbut I make myself available.  So he doesn&#39;t want to talk.  The car doesn&#39;t w<br/>\nork because he always turns the radio on.  It&#39;s too loud for me to hear what<br/>\nhe says, but if I turn it down he gets annoyed.  Then there&#39;s little point<br/>\nin talking because he&#39;s started out annoyed.  I&#39;ve tried lately to just hang<br/>\nout with him, watching TV or whatever.  He seems to appreciate it when I do,<br/>\nbut he still doesn&#39;t talk.
