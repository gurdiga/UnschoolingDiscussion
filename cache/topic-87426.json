She had a female emergency and asked to go to the <br/>\nbathroom.  The teacher said no, repeatedly said NO.  She even told him the <br/>\nreason why she had to go, humiliated as he made her say it outloud to the class.  <br/>\nShe was young, in middle school, kids were hooting and carrying on.  The <br/>\nteacher, a very young first year male teacher, seemed to make a game of it.  Cait <br/>\nwas a quiet student and would never have asked to go at all if it weren&#39;t an <br/>\nemergency.  He knew she wasn&#39;t a loud student who would be demanding and just <br/>\nwalk out.  He was a bully on a power trip and enjoying it.  He made a point of <br/>\nletting two other flirty type girls go to the bathroom when they asked once, <br/>\nafter Cait repeatedly asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily it was the last class of the day, and she came home, devastated and <br/>\nin tears.  She certainly would not be returning to that mess.  As it happened <br/>\nher dad was home when she came in and he finally saw the devastation that <br/>\nschool was causing.  He went immediately to the school and met with principals and <br/>\neveryone he could find (and probably a good thing he couldn&#39;t find the <br/>\nteacher) and explained the situation and how if this teacher EVER embarrassed a child <br/>\nlike that again he would promptly find a way to embarrass the teacher equally <br/>\nin front of his peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got phone calls from parents of students who were in the room that <br/>\nafternoon, asking if it was true and saying they were sorry and their children felt <br/>\nbadly they hadn&#39;t in some way tried to defend or stop the ugliness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teacher still teaches, they just moved him to the high school and now let <br/>\nhim coach there too.  Guess they figured as a first year teacher he had a lot <br/>\nto learn about dealing with children and they would somehow help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeachers are all across the spectrum of society, just like with everything <br/>\nelse.  There can be mean bully types and kind loving dedicated types and <br/>\neverything in between.  I can&#39;t see taking the chance with a child of mine to go <br/>\nthrough anything like that again.  As a parent you really have no control other <br/>\nthan taking the child out of school to stop things or defend things like that.  <br/>\nThe school almost always tends to &quot;follow the party line&quot; and defend the <br/>\nteacher (best in case of lawsuits) and make the child and parents feel less than.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some children wouldn&#39;t be so deeply affected by an incident like this. <br/>\nI wish I had pushed my DH sooner to keep my children home, she would have <br/>\nnever had to experience it.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":76425644,"authorName":"Barbara Moreda","from":"&quot;Barbara Moreda&quot; &lt;homeiscool@...&gt;","profile":"lllbarbara","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Time spent in bathroom was :Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] classroom  wetting","postDate":"1072941261","msgId":87426,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmMwMWMzZDAzNiRlMWNlMjIyMCQxMGVjZmVhOUBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFkMC4xNmZmZjQxOS4yZDI2MmE2MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":87468,"prevInTime":87425,"nextInTime":87427,"topicId":87426,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mine can t ... we only have ONE ... and it seems as soon as someone gets in, another wants in, too!
