About five days ago my<br/>\n&gt; 26-year old son decided to have a cup of instant coffee.  He took a cup<br/>\n&gt; of water and put it in the microwave to heat it up (something that he had<br/>\n&gt; done numerous times before).  I am not sure how long he set the timer for<br/>\n&gt; but he told me he wanted to bring the water to a boil. When the timer<br/>\n&gt; shut<br/>\n&gt; the oven off, he removed the cup from the oven.  As he looked into the<br/>\n&gt; cup he noted that the water was not boiling but instantly the water in<br/>\n&gt; the cup &quot;blew up&quot; into his face. The cup remained intact until he threw<br/>\n&gt; it out of his hand but all the water had flew out into his face due to<br/>\n&gt; the buildup of energy.  His whole face is blistered and he has 1st and<br/>\n&gt; 2nd degree<br/>\n&gt; burns to his face which may leave scarring.  He also may have lost<br/>\n&gt; partial sight in his left eye.   While at the hospital, the doctor who<br/>\n&gt; was attending to him stated that this a fairly common occurrence and<br/>\n&gt; water (alone) should never be heated in a microwave oven.  If water is<br/>\n&gt; heated in this manner, something  should be placed in the cup to diffuse<br/>\n&gt; the energy such as a wooden stir stick, tea bag, etc. It is however a<br/>\n&gt; much safer choice to boil the water in a tea kettle.  Please pass this<br/>\n&gt; information on to friends and family. (Mike J<br/>\n&gt; Tucker, Safety/Security Officer)<br/>\n&gt; This sounds like an urban legend but it isn&#39;t. The issue is that a very<br/>\n&gt; clean cup has no nucleation points to initiate the boiling, and the water<br/>\n&gt; can become superheated beyond the usual boiling point. If mechanically<br/>\n&gt; disturbed in this state, like inserting a spoon or adding your cocoa mix,<br/>\n&gt; all of the stored energy can be released all at once. Not all the<br/>\n&gt; water turns to steam, only a small fraction, but it can throw the<br/>\n&gt; remaining hot water a significant distance.<br/>\n&gt; Meredith Brown<br/>\n&gt; ESH Lessons Learned Program Manager<br/>\n&gt; Los Alamos National Laboratory<br/>\n&gt; 505 667 0604<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The preceding lesson learned was received via e-mail or over the Internet<br/>\n&gt; from another DOE site/contractor.

His whole face is blistered and he has 1st and<br/>\n2nd degree<br/>\nburns to his face which may leave scarring.  He also may have lost<br/>\npartial sight in his left eye.   While at the hospital, the doctor who<br/>\nwas attending to him stated that this a fairly common occurrence and<br/>\nwater (alone) should never be heated in a microwave oven.  If water is<br/>\nheated in this manner, something  should be placed in the cup to diffuse<br/>\nthe energy such as a wooden stir stick, tea bag, etc. It is however a<br/>\nmuch safer choice to boil the water in a tea kettle.  Please pass this<br/>\ninformation on to friends and family. (Mike J<br/>\nTucker, Safety/Security Officer)<br/>\nThis sounds like an urban legend but it isn&#39;t. The issue is that a very<br/>\nclean cup has no nucleation points to initiate the boiling, and the water<br/>\ncan become superheated beyond the usual boiling point. If mechanically<br/>\ndisturbed in this state, like inserting a spoon or adding your cocoa mix,<br/>\nall of the stored energy can be released all at once. Not all the<br/>\nwater turns to steam, only a small fraction, but it can throw the<br/>\nremaining hot water a significant distance.<br/>\nMeredith Brown<br/>\nESH Lessons Learned Program Manager<br/>\nLos Alamos National Laboratory<br/>\n505 667 0604<br/>\n<br/>\nThe preceding lesson learned was received via e-mail or over the Internet<br/>\nfrom another DOE site/contractor.
