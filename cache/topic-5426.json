If he had been a heavy<br/>\nsleeper, I won&#39;t have minded or if it had been for any other reason but it<br/>\nwas just plain old fashioned laziness.  So we had a major discussion about<br/>\nthis.  He didn&#39;t read well until he was about 10 and again, it was because<br/>\nhe was lazy, get someone else to do it for him kinda thing.  I finally had<br/>\nto say that if he wanted to &quot;read&quot; a particular book, he would have to do<br/>\nit himself as he was driving the other kidlets nuts.

I guess you would have to file me under casual because I<br/>\nnever did get too worked up over much of anything and I think since I<br/>\nreally couldn&#39;t have cared one way or the other and a big production wasn&#39;t<br/>\nmade of it, it worked.  Also, diapers were a kind of game, &quot;eeuuuu, let&#39;s<br/>\nget rid of this soggy ol&#39; thing&quot; and other jokes like that which they<br/>\njoined in with.  It wasn&#39;t a matter of shaming them but a joke between mom<br/>\nand kidlet.  None of the kidlets ever had any problem asking the nearest<br/>\nperson we knew to help, &quot;I need ups&quot; was eldest&#39;s usual request.  The potty<br/>\nchair was usually used as a stepping stool to reach the faucet for hand<br/>\nwashing.  I did need to keep an eye on the bathroom because training early<br/>\nhas some draw backs &lt;g&gt; such as toys and apples being stuff down the toilet<br/>\nbecause they are in the room more freely than kidlets that don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; the<br/>\ntoilet yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I gotta tell you, boys were much easier (other than the night<br/>\ntime thing) than daughter was.  The boys took half as much time.  Of<br/>\ncourse, after the first kidlet, the rest seem to almost &quot;train&quot; each other.<br/>\n The older boys hauled the smaller boys along with them to use the<br/>\nbathroom.
