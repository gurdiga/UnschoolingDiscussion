My kids have asked for &quot;toys&quot; that fall into the &quot;learning toy&quot; category and for them it&#39;s about &quot;fun.&quot;  I think everything they enjoy doing (or playing with) is a learning adventure so every toy has that potential.<br/>\nLisa H.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kristi Hayes <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 14, 2004 5:13 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Violent toys?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is this off-topic?  If it is, please say so . <br/>\n<br/>\n  I try to be purposeful, or somewhat so, about the toys my kids have.<br/>\n  Sure, a lot of it is stuff I wouldn&#39;t consider &quot;learning&quot; toys, etc.,<br/>\n  but I have a problem including toys that are &quot;violent&quot; such as guns,<br/>\n  swords, green army men.  My thought is that if they want these toys they<br/>\n  can fashion them from sticks, bats, green rocks, or whatever.  It is one<br/>\n  way I have of sharing nonviolent values w/my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Do any of you have similar values?  How did you address it with family<br/>\n  and friends?  It hasn&#39;t been an issue w/my girl but I expect, based on<br/>\n  giving of vague aunts and uncles to other boys in the family, that with<br/>\n  this birthday (#2) or next it will be an issue.  I&#39;ve spread the word as<br/>\n  best I can, but if such a gift is given, how might I approach it w/out<br/>\n  coming off as rude and irrational?<br/>\n<br/>\n  On a broader note, does it much matter if one has a lot of &quot;learning&quot;<br/>\n  toys around the house vs. toys like electronic VTech toys?  (My family&#39;s<br/>\n  favorite gifts.)  I&#39;m wondering if I should start constructing a<br/>\n  different environment or just wait until they ask for these &quot;learning&quot;<br/>\n  toys (tinkertoys, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for any thoughts or advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kristi<br/>\n  Semi-crunchy unschooling mom to Morgaine 4 Â½,  Orion 2, and Isaac 5 wks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Yahoo!
