So, for now, I have to choose my <br/>\nbattles because in the end, I want to be able to go to lunch with my <br/>\nadult children and laugh and tell secrets and all that good stuff.

I&#39;ve always felt guilty for thinking<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m a better mother than my own mother and in fact, when I first read<br/>\n&gt; your statement to that effect the other day, it bugged me that you<br/>\n&gt; said that. But then, when I re-read it again in this post (below) I<br/>\n&gt; thought, ya know... she&#39;s exactly right!  I&#39;ve been trying to believe<br/>\n&gt; that she (MY mom) did the best she could for us under her<br/>\n&gt; circumstances. But ya know what? She *didn&#39;t* do the best she<br/>\n&gt; could.... she took a part time job to get *away* from all of us<br/>\n&gt; (there were five) because she never got any help from my dDad. We<br/>\n&gt; were left to raise ourselves. Your mom threw water on your son. My<br/>\n&gt; mom poured a glass of milk over my brother&#39;s head while he was<br/>\n&gt; strapped in his high chair (this was ages ago... WHY do I so vividly<br/>\n&gt; remember it!).<br/>\n&gt; (pause)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Damn... and although I haven&#39;t poured milk on anybody or thrown water<br/>\n&gt; in the girls&#39; faces, I have done my fair share of poor-parenting. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; outta here for tonight... gotta go mend some fences and work on my<br/>\n&gt; parenting skills.<br/>\n&gt; (*still* searching for the parenting manual that was supposed to be<br/>\n&gt; given out at childbirth)<br/>\n&gt; Sarah<br/>\n&gt; ~xx~ ~xx~ ~xx~<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Carothers<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is it that we&#39;re (people in general) reduced to being our parents<br/>\nchildren even after we&#39;ve grown up?  It is rare to find the adult<br/>\nchild/adult parent relationship that honors each other as adults.<br/>\n    The wounds inflicted (knowingly or not) by parents seem to linger at<br/>\nleast a lifetime.

I,<br/>\ntoo, sometimes find myself falling way short of my ideal in loving and<br/>\nnurturing my children.  It usually happens when I get off center,  out of<br/>\nbalance,  sleep deprived.
