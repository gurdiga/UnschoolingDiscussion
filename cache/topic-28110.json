Otherwise, you are just being<br/>\n&gt; reactionary  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is my thought on all this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was raised by the very typical Cleaver-type parents, loving, nurturing,<br/>\n&gt; but definitely in control of many areas.  When I had kids, I just<br/>\nnaturally<br/>\n&gt; kind of fell into that.  It seemed very normal to set time limits on<br/>\n&gt; television, not let kids climb high, require veggies before dessert, etc..<br/>\n&gt; The kids would ask for something or to do something and I would find<br/>\nmyself<br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;no&quot; more out of habit than anything else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After I found unschooling, I found that I began to question so many<br/>\n&quot;givens&quot;<br/>\n&gt; in my life, that things didn&#39;t have to be a certain pre-set way.  So I<br/>\n&gt; started to look at various things at our house and how we did things.  Why<br/>\n&gt; did I have a time limit on television?  Would my kids just sit in front of<br/>\n&gt; the television all day, even when I had other interesting things available<br/>\n&gt; for them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did I have to deny my kids soda?  Or by talking with them about healthy<br/>\n&gt; choices, about how there is 7 of us and we need to share, would they not<br/>\nhog<br/>\n&gt; down a 3 liter bottle?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Was it necessary that the 3 yo clean up their mess alone whenever I<br/>\ndecided<br/>\n&gt; it was time?  Or could I decide to clean it up and ask if she wanted to<br/>\nhelp<br/>\n&gt; me?  Could I provide room for her to learn competence by allowing her to<br/>\n&gt; work alongside me doing &quot;chores&quot; rather than simply let her &quot;help&quot; a<br/>\nlittle<br/>\n&gt; so I could make sure the dishes were put away &quot;properly&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think unschooling/unparenting is necessarily about &quot;you have to do<br/>\n&gt; it this prescribed way&quot;, but about questioning your motives, checking out<br/>\n&gt; alternatives, giving kids as much freedom as is absolutely possible.<br/>\n&gt; Example:  My 8 and 4 yo today had taken the mattress off the bottom bunk<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; placed it at an angle so it made a slide.  They were wearing sweatsuits<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; jumping off the top bunk, landing on the mattress with their knees and<br/>\n&gt; sliding down.  These 2 do this kind of stuff and it isn&#39;t a big deal to<br/>\nme,<br/>\n&gt; but most moms I know would have a cow about how they could get hurt (I do<br/>\n&gt; remind the kids to be careful because bonked heads hurt).-----but my 3yo<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t allowed to play out front by himself.  He has no fear at all and<br/>\n&gt; simply follows various wildlife off into the undeveloped land around us.<br/>\nWe<br/>\n&gt; talk a lot about needing to stay here but his priorities are different.  I<br/>\n&gt; do go outside with him daily out front, take walks into the surrounding<br/>\n&gt; land, let him play independently in the fenced backyard. but I also know<br/>\n&gt; that I am in charge of where he plays.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, thats my take.  I want to always question myself, to try to figure<br/>\n&gt; out a way that the kids can do things they want safely, even if it is a<br/>\n&gt; little scary for me, rather than simply deny them, to be open to their<br/>\ninput<br/>\n&gt; so we can have agreements about how things get done rather than me<br/>\ndeciding<br/>\n&gt; alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

So I<br/>\nstarted to look at various things at our house and how we did things.  Why<br/>\ndid I have a time limit on television?  Would my kids just sit in front of<br/>\nthe television all day, even when I had other interesting things available<br/>\nfor them?<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I have to deny my kids soda?  Or by talking with them about healthy<br/>\nchoices, about how there is 7 of us and we need to share, would they not hog<br/>\ndown a 3 liter bottle?<br/>\n<br/>\nWas it necessary that the 3 yo clean up their mess alone whenever I decided<br/>\nit was time?  Or could I decide to clean it up and ask if she wanted to help<br/>\nme?  Could I provide room for her to learn competence by allowing her to<br/>\nwork alongside me doing &quot;chores&quot; rather than simply let her &quot;help&quot; a little<br/>\nso I could make sure the dishes were put away &quot;properly&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think unschooling/unparenting is necessarily about &quot;you have to do<br/>\nit this prescribed way&quot;, but about questioning your motives, checking out<br/>\nalternatives, giving kids as much freedom as is absolutely possible.<br/>\nExample:  My 8 and 4 yo today had taken the mattress off the bottom bunk and<br/>\nplaced it at an angle so it made a slide.  They were wearing sweatsuits and<br/>\njumping off the top bunk, landing on the mattress with their knees and<br/>\nsliding down.  These 2 do this kind of stuff and it isn&#39;t a big deal to me,<br/>\nbut most moms I know would have a cow about how they could get hurt (I do<br/>\nremind the kids to be careful because bonked heads hurt).-----but my 3yo<br/>\nisn&#39;t allowed to play out front by himself.  He has no fear at all and<br/>\nsimply follows various wildlife off into the undeveloped land around us.  We<br/>\ntalk a lot about needing to stay here but his priorities are different.  I<br/>\ndo go outside with him daily out front, take walks into the surrounding<br/>\nland, let him play independently in the fenced backyard. but I also know<br/>\nthat I am in charge of where he plays.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thats my take.  I want to always question myself, to try to figure<br/>\nout a way that the kids can do things they want safely, even if it is a<br/>\nlittle scary for me, rather than simply deny them, to be open to their input<br/>\nso we can have agreements about how things get done rather than me deciding<br/>\nalone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jG-oBHMMhKC8zLHOtBOkM6HZxQaR9zx3VtO3DnmGAF06AGVnrtIFewSzdQCc88Zp62GFtMNY3MD5sxt-spU6f4SwySKbY7U_IoU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1602","postDate":"1006280867","msgId":28110,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWMxNzFmMSQxY2RlYjkyMCQxZmE3YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDYyNzU2MzkuMzU4Mi4yMzI0OC5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28118,"prevInTime":28109,"nextInTime":28111,"topicId":28110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1298723434\">&lt;&lt;I&#39;d get really frustrated if I brought something in I wanted to have some<br/>\nof in a few days&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was a baby, dh and I had an exchange student live with us.<br/>\nDh doesn&#39;t like diet coke and I had never &quot;shared&quot; before with someone who<br/>\njust ate and drank until nothing was left in the house.
