The word abuse seems to have many and broad definitions, so <br/>\n  perhaps another word needs to be used (like traumatized or <br/>\n  brutalized) for what parents definitely do not have the right to do <br/>\n  to their kids or to anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** I like brutalized, I think. It can&#39;t be mistaken for the &quot;abuse&quot; of not sending your children to public school or of not vaccinating your children or of choosing to formula-feed your children. All of which are abuses to some people. <br/>\n<br/>\n  2. In light of a number of experiences cited on this list, up to an <br/>\n  including death, there needs to be a mechanism to step in where the <br/>\n  line in point 1 is crossed.  Brutal parents will not automatically <br/>\n  stop what they are doing to their children.  So someone else needs <br/>\n  to.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  With you, I agree that the ideal solution is a close family or <br/>\n  community of friends.  They know the situation best and when to step <br/>\n  in.  In this case, the &quot;it takes a village&quot; should come into play.  <br/>\n  Not Big Brother the state, but a local community (as someone pointed <br/>\n  out, like in tribal Africa).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mike<br/>\n  with you on this, and wishing I had a better solution to this problem<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ** Wonder if a &quot;back-to-family&quot; campaign could be started? :-)<br/>\n  Myranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

It does nothing but anger and/or upset the mother, the <br/>\n&gt; child assumes permission has been granted to act whatever way or do <br/>\n&gt; whatever the stranger mentions, and all it does is cause problems and chaos <br/>\n&gt; and sore feelings. People should offer help or advice instead of forcing <br/>\n&gt; it. Then the person, if the offer is accepted, can talk about it away from <br/>\n&gt; the child, away from the situation, and with a lot more of an open mind. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   In the case of child abuse, the law should be called in to protect the <br/>\n&gt; child. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But according to your very words, you can&#39;t know if it is abuse or not.

I think <br/>\nwe would all agree (maybe not?) that adult to adult spanking is not <br/>\ndesired.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want to discuss the propriety of an adult spanking someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s chld, I think that is a different (certainly valid) thread.  I <br/>\nrealize that it has been posted here that parents do not own their <br/>\nchildren.  However you view that, there is still a relationship <br/>\nbetween parent and child that does not exist between any other adult <br/>\nand the child (or state and child).  I doubt if anyone here (or <br/>\nanywhere) would give blanket permission for any adult to spank any <br/>\nchild not his/her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as I see it, we are left on this thread with the defensibility of <br/>\na parent spanking her/his child.  That unique relationship, I <br/>\nbelieve, makes this activity different from the other examples of <br/>\nadult to adult and non-parent to child.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery single child is different.  While some don&#39;t budge for (or seem <br/>\nto mind) a spanking, and other are heartbroken, there are some <br/>\nchildren in between for which at times it could be just the <br/>\ncommunication method needed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife and I rarely spank anymore (haven&#39;t in a long time anyway), <br/>\nbut when we did (when our children were younger), we cuddled them <br/>\nafterwards and the kids were always more loving and well-behaved <br/>\nafterwards.  Not saying this was the only way, but am saying it <br/>\nworked.  And knowing it was a possibility allowed us to use it <br/>\nsparingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] spanking as abuse?","postDate":"1035336949","msgId":47405,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3YS4xMDkxY2M3Ni4yYWU3NTZmNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47401,"nextInTopic":47415,"prevInTime":47404,"nextInTime":47406,"topicId":47352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/22/02 3:19:27 PM, myrandab@bellsouth.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1381093226\">In a message dated 10/22/02 3:19:27 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:myrandab@...\">myrandab@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve never considered it abuse, and neither do most laws and families. <br/>\nMany doctors promote it.

The word abuse seems to have many and broad definitions, so <br/>\nperhaps another word needs to be used (like traumatized or <br/>\nbrutalized) for what parents definitely do not have the right to do <br/>\nto their kids or to anyone.<br/>\n 2.

Here is my position, plain and simple, and without all the OT questions I keep getting thrown. Parents have the right to raise their kids any way they deem fit, excepting abuse. I disagree strongly with a stranger, who does not know circumstances and will likely never see the person/family again, telling people how they should be raising their kids or telling them they are doing whatever-it-is wrong or they should be doing so-and-so instead. It does nothing but anger and/or upset the mother, the child assumes permission has been granted to act whatever way or do whatever the stranger mentions, and all it does is cause problems and chaos and sore feelings. People should offer help or advice instead of forcing it. Then the person, if the offer is accepted, can talk about it away from the child, away from the situation, and with a lot more of an open mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n  In the case of child abuse, the law should be called in to protect the child. <br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s all I was saying, and have NO idea where all the questions came in about drunks, sexual abuse, and husbands beating their wives. ?????? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Listen to what everyone else is saying? I&#39;ve definitely tried, but this has gone in twenty different directions!

A vivid memory is getting slapped across the face <br/>\nfrom my mom when I repeated her saying &quot;up your ass!&quot; I never thought it <br/>\nreally damaged me (it did) and also had a husband at the time that believed <br/>\nin spanking as being no big deal. He had wooden spoons broken on his butt <br/>\nwell into adolescents. He always thought fearing your parents was a good <br/>\nthing.

I <br/>\nnever was around kids and had no experience what so ever with them. But, <br/>\nwhen Tara wouldn&#39;t listen like I thought she should, I would pop her on the <br/>\ndiaper. I can guarantee you it didn&#39;t physically hurt her. It got her <br/>\nattention but at the same time, I&#39;m not saying it didn&#39;t harm her. Just not <br/>\nto physically hurt. I just thought that was the right thing to do and it <br/>\nnever got any harder than that, even when she was out of diapers.

Just that I did it, and I never hit hard, <br/>\nor repeatedly spanked as in turning over ones knee and hitting more than <br/>\nonce. Never popped her anywhere but her diaper or butt.

It is violence.  It is a big person being violent towards a little <br/>\nperson.  It is a big person communicating - unwittingly - that it is okay <br/>\nto hit.  What is the point of a &quot;light swat on the bottom&quot; other than to <br/>\ndominate and humiliate.  Do you really want your kids to learn that it is <br/>\nokay to dominate and humiliate other people, especially if they are smaller <br/>\nand less powerful than you!?  If you are angry enough to hit, then you, as <br/>\na mature adult, should be able to communicate your anger in meaningful and <br/>\nnonviolent ways.  If you cannot, walking away is the best model for a <br/>\nkid.  &quot;I&#39;m so angry, I cannot talk to you right now&quot; is much more honest <br/>\nthan a &quot;swat on the bottom&quot; and it&#39;s much better for a kid to know that <br/>\nwhen they are that angry, they can walk away.
