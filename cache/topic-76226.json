I think it was because<br/>\nof a few things. Not in any particular order.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I had talked about our schooling lives a lot. He hated<br/>\nschool, wasn&#39;t good at it and was pretty much labeled loser there. He became<br/>\npart of the party group and just passed by to graduate. The only thing about<br/>\nschool he did like was the friends he had and the fun they had skipping and<br/>\nhanging out. I on the other hand, learned how to maneuver the system for me<br/>\nto get through quite well. Making the grades came easy for me without trying<br/>\nmuch and I learned how to get on the good side of most of my teachers. High<br/>\nschool was easy for me but I still hated it every step of the way. Most of<br/>\nthe subjects bored me to tears and I had no interest in them whatsoever. The<br/>\nones I did like I could only go so far in so I didn&#39;t &quot;lose&quot; the rest. I<br/>\nhated the little school groups and popular and unpopular people put in them.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t hang with many at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTara at a very young age showed how extremely inquisitive and intelligent<br/>\nshe could be. She was an awesome kid, and when I &quot;had&quot; to put her in<br/>\npreshcool, I saw that slowly get squashed. Elementary school was even worse<br/>\nand this bright energetic kid was turning into mush before my eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, I had a very unscooling family right in front of me when I first<br/>\njoined a support group. Her kids were already between 14-17. So it was very<br/>\neasy for me to see how it all worked. She asked the same question over a<br/>\nlot. Why??? Everytime someone wanted to do something or thought something<br/>\nshould be a certain way, she would ask why? I started to see how some people<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t answer that and some gave it great thought. It made sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo between that family, us seeing what was happening to Tara and our own<br/>\nexperiences in school, all the while watching Joseph and Sierra thrive on<br/>\njust being kids, it was inevitable for us to get it all. We were lucky. I<br/>\njust wish I would have known about this years ago. I mean way long ago. Not<br/>\nsure I could have kept Tara home because of her dad, but I sure would have<br/>\ngiven it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd speaking of that, Miss Tara, big advocate of school, just yesterday<br/>\nannounced that she could have very easily, looking back now, given up school<br/>\nall through junior high. But says she wouldn&#39;t want to miss high school.<br/>\nHey, there may be hope for my grandchildren yet!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] just saying hi (introduction)","postDate":"1057519475","msgId":76260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdBMUE2REIwLUFGRTctMTFENy1BNjE0LTAwMEE5NTZFMTA5RUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNjYwMWMzNDM3OSQyYTEzMDgyMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76259,"nextInTopic":76264,"prevInTime":76259,"nextInTime":76261,"topicId":76226,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It was really <br/>\nvery fun. Then we did the American Civil war - because Roya and Rox had <br/>\njust read Across Five Aprils and were into Civil War stuff. That was <br/>\nokay - but not as much fun as going to the beach and Sea World, etc. <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;. We did go to a civil war re-enactment which was cool. That was it <br/>\n- by the end of that month the kids were busy with their own interests <br/>\nand I couldn&#39;t find a good time to interrupt them to do another unit <br/>\nstudy.

Currently we have 2 angora goats, 2 milk goats, <br/>\n2 adult sheep, and 14 lambs.  The sheep population will be less in the fall <br/>\nthough.  What breed do you raise?  Ours are a motley crew of mixes (mostly <br/>\nsuffolk, jacob, coopworth.)  Just did most of my own shearing this year...what a <br/>\njob!  We have 40+ acres, but probably only about 8 of that is cleared.  <br/>\nHowever, we lease the other half of this farm (the owner lost our half in a divorce, <br/>\nwe bought it) and it has probably another 15 acres of field/meadow.

Within that year my husband and I were convinced that<br/>\n&gt;unschooling was the way to go. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I used to teach school-group classes at a Science Museum, and then at a Demonstration Farm/Nature Center.  The difference in enthusiasm, participation, and general behavior of the children was STRIKINGLY different between public school groups and home-school groups.  Kindergarten and first grade levels were pretty similar -- all the kids were very enthusiastic about the topic matter, readily volunteered answers and suggestions, and were absolute delights to speak with.  By the time 2nd and 3rd grade levels came, the public-school kids were much rowdier, less enthusiastic, and were volunteering less and were much more easily distractable.  3rd and 4th graders were even more so, and there was a scale up to middle school/high school level, where the kids all sat slumped in their chairs and nobody volunteered.  UGH, what a nightmare for a program presenter!!!  But the home-school groups, regardless of the age level, were ALL enthusiastic and increasingly brimming with knowledge and a thirst for learning.  Didn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to see what the reasons for that difference is!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think for us, having children so young and<br/>\n&gt;not near that dreaded &quot;school age&quot; was a good thing. We had plenty of time<br/>\n&gt;to ask questions, read information and bounce our own ideas back and forth<br/>\n&gt;without feelig like there was a time limit or having family and well meaning<br/>\n&gt;friends looking down their noses at us. By the time they all did that, we<br/>\n&gt;knew what we wanted for our kids and had the answers to shut them up!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>:-)  I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll be able to come up with some ideas of what to say to my in-laws when the subject comes up eventually (as my kids not starting school will become evident at some point! LOL).  Will be hard for them I think, they are both teachers (and believe strongly in public schooling).  I don&#39;t exactly see eye-to-eye with them on a lot of issues (like everything, LOL), so have not even broached the subject with them yet.  Am dreading that eventuality.  I actually suspect that&#39;s part of DH&#39;s problems with the idea, as it&#39;s bound to be a real bone of contention between them, and he&#39;s going to need to feel confident about the decision in order to support it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Plus so much of unschooling can be seen so clearly when the kids are young.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is SO true!

We raise sheep and angora rabbits and Collies, and I work at home teaching herding and dog obedience lessons.  (I also run a cottage industry producing fiber for hand-spinners, but have sort of put that project on the back-burner while the kids are small.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are early in our unschooling journey -- Jacob is 2 1/2 yrs and Gabriel is 4 mos.  I am very passionate about and committed to unschooling our kids, DH is a little more skeptical (tho he&#39;ll come around eventually &lt;G&gt;).  His biggest concern is not limiting their future potential, so I&#39;ve been trying to find websites, etc, that talk about what unschoolers are doing in their adult lives.  If anyone has any relevant sites to share, I&#39;d love to know about them!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been enjoying reading the posts and following the links, and look forward to the support and ideas that this list is sure to generate for me over the upcoming years!
