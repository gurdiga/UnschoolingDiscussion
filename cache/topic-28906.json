Does she have <br/>\ndifficulty with phonics, or has she not developed enough of a sight <br/>\nvocabulary so she has to sound out every word?  If it&#39;s phonics, I worked <br/>\nwith Lars using a book called The Road to Reading.  It isn&#39;t geared toward <br/>\nreally young kids, and it really helped with his phonics.  (The fact that I <br/>\nwas insisting that he do it caused other problems, but if your daughter is <br/>\nreally wanting to learn, it shouldn&#39;t cause her any.)  If the problem is <br/>\nwith sight words or other fluency difficulties, there are sites on the <br/>\ninternet that offer exercises in increasing reading fluency.  I&#39;m afraid I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have any urls for you, but searching on reading fluency found me a <br/>\nbunch when I looked before.  They didn&#39;t help my son, again because he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want help at that time.  The other thing is just lots of <br/>\npractise.  Maybe you could get right away from the books with reading <br/>\nlevels.  Go to the library and get short picture books or early chapter <br/>\nbooks without any grade levels on them for her to read.  If you can get <br/>\nbook and tape sets, all the better, though you might need to sit with her <br/>\nand help her keep her place.  A lot of them go too fast for the early reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you can pinpoint where the problem is, the easier it will be for <br/>\nus to come up with suggestions.  Above all, help her find books she <br/>\nenjoys.  You do still read to her don&#39;t you?  A lot of people find that <br/>\ngetting the child to read every second chapter or page or even paragraph <br/>\ncan improve the reading skills with less frustration than asking them to do <br/>\nall the reading.  Even asking her to read the first paragraph of every <br/>\nchapter or something would give her practise.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n********************************************************************************************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice <br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"8f3Y2-RLMnsJ5Yx0C8YDY5ZZCUG_12EyrXDCeGeTGpojraSJO0N8nee5UTtejRcJ9_0-ls9g3HohzV_g9CpP9Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: reading late, was: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1633","postDate":"1007052463","msgId":28929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTMwMTY1My5mQVVHcnc5eDAzMDMxNEBueWNzbXRwM291dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28906,"nextInTopic":28958,"prevInTime":28928,"nextInTime":28930,"topicId":28906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
