I&#39;m still catching up after being in the hospital for a <br/>\ncouple of days and having a broken ankle...<br/>\n<br/>\nI must be really lucky.  My parents live an hour and a half away, but are <br/>\nageing and it is difficult for them to help.  The paramedics called them and <br/>\nthey came right away.  We have wonderful friends and neighbors on our block.  <br/>\nThe kids went from house to house, were dressed, bathed, fed, nourished, <br/>\nplayed with and loved every minute of my hospitalization.  As soon as it was <br/>\nclear the extent of the fracture, a friend down the street started calling <br/>\neveryone she knows to get a lead on a nanny.  We hired one last night <br/>\n(Thursday), just four days after the fall.  We have dinner coming every other <br/>\nnight.  We have people begging to do errands, running to the library, fixing <br/>\nour vacuum cleaner, etc.  Maybe we just live in Mayberry, but it does happen <br/>\nin this day and age.  A diverse group of public and Catholic schoolers, <br/>\nchristians, agnostics, undeclareds, republicans, democrats, tall, short, fat, <br/>\nfit, big families, small families, grown children, little children and those <br/>\ninbetween.  We all have a desire to live in a community together and make our <br/>\nlives easier.  We work at it.  We&#39;ve made our own family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s humbling to be on the receiving end of such caring attention.  <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47561,"nextTopicId":48107}}
