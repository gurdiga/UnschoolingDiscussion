No problem <br/>\n&gt; there if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after. :o) If you&#39;d like a glimpse at a totally <br/>\n&gt; radical unschooling lifestyle, be prepared to get an earful from some of <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; folks here. It&#39;s just a few steps different than what you&#39;ve described.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know, that&#39;s really how I&#39;ve defined our homeschooling style, almost to <br/>\nthe letter.  I&#39;ve used the term &#39;unschooly&#39; since I know we don&#39;t quite <br/>\nclassicaly fit the true definition.  We&#39;re obviously a lot closer to <br/>\nunschooling than &#39;schooling at home.&#39; (at least in my opinion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever be true unschoolers, and I&#39;m comfortable with <br/>\nthat.  Just like everything else in my life, I don&#39;t find it necessary to fit <br/>\neverything into &#39;a box&#39; or do it just as prescribed by others to be happy or <br/>\ncomfortable with our approach and outcome.  I&#39;ve always gone with my heart <br/>\n(definitely a true &quot;Attachment Parent&quot;) and followed our own path.  I find <br/>\ncircles of acquantainces where we embrace each other for our unique <br/>\nperspectives and paths and are supportive of such.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, is an &#39;almost there&#39; unschooly and open-minded homeschooler still welcome <br/>\nto lurk and also contribute and question???

I offer my children <br/>\nguidance each and every day. That&#39;s what I consider good parenting.

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be my children&#39;s teacher, I want to be their mom. I don&#39;t <br/>\nrequire, suggest or guide them into activities that are considered <br/>\neducational. We join activities that are fun, interesting, exciting or <br/>\nuseful. In that process, the educational just happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;does this sound like some sort of unschooling?
