It was an extraordinary experience of<br/>\nculture clashing and different ways of working. However the relevance to<br/>\nthis topic is that not recording live sound - dialogue or effects or room<br/>\ntone or anything - is the &quot;way it is done&quot; generally in Asia. On that movie<br/>\neveryone just spoke their native tongue - either Mandarin (I think) or<br/>\nEnglish - making for some odd scenes. I&#39;ll tell the whole story to anyone<br/>\nwho is interested in funny &quot;behind the scenes&quot; stuff if I ever see you. The<br/>\nmovie, which seemed appallingly bad to all of us local workers, was<br/>\nevidently the biggest hit in Taiwan of that particular summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
