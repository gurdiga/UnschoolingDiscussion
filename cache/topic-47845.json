I  <br/>\ntold one of the Christian-curriculum parents who was pushing  Kirby  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t read and wouldn&#39;t test very well at all.

I started on a path to unschooling last year, but was very worried about the &quot;authorities&quot;.  I live in Pennsylvania, where unschooled kids are required to take a standardized test in 5th grade (plus 2 other years).  I get to decide when my son is in 5th grade, so I wrote him down as being in 4th last year in order to avoid giving him the test.  I was so nervous that if he didn&#39;t do well, someone from the school district would tell me he wasn&#39;t getting a proper education and say I had to send him to school.  Then I met a wonderful unschooling mom who has been an &quot;evaluator&quot; (another PA requirement) for about 20 years.  She told me not to worry, and to have my son take the test with no prior preparation.  This is what always happens, in her experience:  If he scores in the 90s, someone from the school will invite us in, give us a tour of their &quot;wonderful&quot; facilities, and tell us that they think our son would benefit from attending school.  If he scores in the 20s, they&#39;ll call me in and tell me how wonderful it is that I care enough about my son to give him the individual attention he needs.  If he scores somewhere in the middle they won&#39;t take notice of us.  In other words, the schools want the high scorers because it makes them look good; the low scorers they can do without.  This was a tremendous relief for me.  In France the situation might not be the same, but you might find similar relief by finding someone who&#39;s been there and done that in France.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth Cugal</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Intro new French mom","postDate":"1255699750","msgId":48019,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlCMDJCQjg1LUMzMzYtNDYzNi1CNUQ4LTVCQkVFMTRDMDU2M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhiOXBybitza2pnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhiOXBybitza2pnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48018,"nextInTopic":48052,"prevInTime":48018,"nextInTime":48020,"topicId":47845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- My husband is French as well and I will be emailing you off list so we can chat and share resources because sometimes it helps when he is the one who can","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1029618190\">-=-<br/>\nMy husband is French as well and I will be emailing you off list so we  <br/>\ncan chat and share resources because sometimes it helps when he is the  <br/>\none who can read about unschooling. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLinks here will lead to more, but here&#39;s my French collection:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/french\">http://sandradodd.com/french</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the kind words about the book!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/bigbook\">http://sandradodd.com/bigbook</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241904499,"authorName":"zurro","from":"&quot;zurro&quot; &lt;zurrolaur@...&gt;","profile":"zurrolaur","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Intro new French mom","postDate":"1255697079","msgId":48018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhiOXBybitza2pnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU0MjQ0LjcxMDMyLnFtQHdlYjI2NTA0Lm1haWwudWtsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48016,"nextInTopic":48019,"prevInTime":48017,"nextInTime":48019,"topicId":47845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Valentine, Welcome to the forum :) this is a fabulous place for information!

It&#39;s  <br/>\ndifficult after so many years of schooling and the fear of the  <br/>\ncontrols we have to face here in France does not help .-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I lived where the government was pressing for tests, I think (in  <br/>\nretrospect, because my kids are big now) I would figure out how low a  <br/>\ntest score they could get and still be okay, and figure out whether  <br/>\nrandom answers would get that high a score, and if not teach to the  <br/>\ntest just a little, but I would never &quot;teach to the test&quot; &quot;for  <br/>\nexcellence.&quot;   The older I get the more I&#39;m ashamed I was ever so  <br/>\nproud of my test scores.  And I wish I could average mine in with  <br/>\nsomeone (everyone) who was ever afraid or ashamed by lower test scores.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids figure all the need to do is get a 30 or whatever, and then go  <br/>\nback to playing and dreaming, how much better their lives will be than  <br/>\nthose kids who are slaving away for the 99s.  Or even than those kids  <br/>\nwho are skipping blindly into the 90th percentiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying and dreaming are pretty awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":242590232,"authorName":"Valentine","from":"Valentine &lt;matsacha33@...&gt;","profile":"matsacha33","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Intro new French mom","postDate":"1255035294","msgId":47845,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Mjk4My4zNDkxOS5xbUB3ZWIyNjUwNy5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47846,"prevInTime":47844,"nextInTime":47846,"topicId":47845,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello!

I&#39;m French (I hope the mistakes won&#39;t be a problem!).  I live in Bordeaux, with Mathias and our kids, Sacha (4 and 1/2) and Lily (1). <br/>\n <br/>\nBefore Sacha was born, I thought everything was simple and that we didn&#39;t need to read anything... A cesarean later and after failing breastfeeding, I realized i really needed to do something to stop hurting my child. I started doing some research on the internet and read a lot. I discovered babywearing, cosleeping... and later homeschooling then unschooling thanks to &quot;grandir&quot;, a French unschooling list. On this list, Sylvie told me about John Holt and... Sandra Dodd. Your website, Sandra, changed my life and was a real eye-opener. <br/>\n<br/>\nThree and a half years after Sacha, I gave birth to Lily at home, she stayed close to me almost 24/24 the first months of her life, actually until she began to crawl, breastfeeding has been and still is so simple and natural... <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have a pretty joyful life and unschooling has a lot to do with it. <br/>\nBut I still have to be careful sometimes not to be controlling and I also still make real efforts not to think in school terms. It&#39;s difficult after so many years of schooling and the fear of the controls we have to face here in France does not help .<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I&#39;ve decided to introduce myself after reading you for a few months.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n <br/>\nValentine<br/>\nMom to Sacha, 4 1/2 and Lily, 1<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48035,"nextTopicId":48037}}
