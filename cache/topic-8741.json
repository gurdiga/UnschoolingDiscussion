In case there is a problem with<br/>\nyeast, and if the red bottom has been going on long term, that could be a<br/>\npossibility. The acidopholus should help balance the bacteria in the tummy.<br/>\nImportant on the processed food though. If you are nursing, breast milk is<br/>\namazing for red bottoms. Other than that, buy some comfrey and steep it with<br/>\nhot water (hot like for tea) and mix it up in the food processor and apply<br/>\nthat several times a day. It will be gone. Now, if you are going to go out<br/>\nand buy some acidopholus, most capsules are &#39;enteric coated&#39; which means<br/>\nthat they are coated with gelatin. One that is widely available is the<br/>\nNature&#39;s Way children&#39;s powder. I&#39;ve called the company and it is completely<br/>\nvegetarian.

But there are many good brands, Bio Kleen, Ecover, etc. And<br/>\nthey are widely available. As far as bath soap, something very gentle and<br/>\nnatural. No &#39;fragrances&#39; in it. I would say purchase it at a natural foods<br/>\nco-op or store if you can. Dr.Bronner&#39;s soaps are great. Also very, very<br/>\ngood for the skin is Chandrika Ayurvedic soap, little box, green bar. Hard<br/>\nto find in some areas, you might want to find an Indian grocer and ask them<br/>\nabout it. Or your natural food store might be able to get ahold of it if<br/>\nthey don&#39;t carry it. I wouldn&#39;t suggest any bleach or fabric softener (you<br/>\nmight already have stopped using these things).
