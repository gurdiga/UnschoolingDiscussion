A very sweet and  <br/>\nfunny book about nine months of preparing for the birth of a Down syndrome  baby.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe briefly talks about what she&#39;s learned from him in the years since his  <br/>\nbirth (most of it is what she learned while pregnant with him). Here&#39;s an  <br/>\nexerpt:<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;By the time he was six, I was ready to give up [on his  learning how to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>recognize letters on his own].<br/>\n <br/>\n...one day John [husband] was holding up a plastic letter and making its  <br/>\nsound, which happend to be &quot;EEEEEE,&quot; when Adam suddenly perked up and said,  <br/>\n&quot;Wizbef!&quot; This is the way he pronounces his sister Elizabeth&#39;s name. Naturally,  <br/>\nJohn and I took this as ample cause to stay home from work and celebrate. <br/>\nDuring  that day, we discovered that Adam&#39;s learning capacity went way beyond <br/>\nanything  we expected----as long as everything he learned related directly to <br/>\nsomeone he  cared about. He had absolutely no interest in, for example, &quot;E is for <br/>\negg.&quot; But  E for Elizabeth----now THAT was crucial information.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the end we all learned the alphabet this way. The symbols we had been  <br/>\ntrying to link to abstract sounds ended up as a parade of personalities: Adam  <br/>\nfirst, of course, then Billy, Caleb, Diane. Elizabeth, Francine, Grandpa,.... As <br/>\n we figured out how he learned, the landscape of our son&#39;s mind began to <br/>\nreveal  itself to us. Instead of rationally constructed structure of empirical  <br/>\nobservations, logical conclusions, and arbitrary symbols, Adam&#39;s mental world  <br/>\nseems more like a huge family reunion. It&#39;s a gathering of people, all linked <br/>\nby  Adam&#39;s affection into a complex universe of relationships and <br/>\ncharacteristics.  In this universe, Adam learns as fast as anyone I know. <br/>\n <br/>\nLong before he could read or write even the most basic words (or so I  <br/>\nthought), Adam came home to tell me, in his garbled tongue, about the new  boy who <br/>\nhad just moved into his class, and who had become Adam&#39;s  friend. When I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand his pronunciation of the boy&#39;s name, Adam  grabbed a pencil in <br/>\nhis stubby, grubby little-boy fingers, and wrote, &quot;Miguel  Fernando de la Hoya&quot; <br/>\non a piece of paper---a piece of paper, needless to say,  which I intend to <br/>\nframe. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIf we will allow them to make the connections, they WILL----just maybe not  <br/>\nin the same way we do.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":197017321,"authorName":"Tracey Inman","from":"&quot;Tracey Inman&quot; &lt;traceyi@...&gt;","profile":"tracey_inman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Dyslexia-long-help?","postDate":"1095436467","msgId":99673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBKRUdJT0VEQUVQSUdCQ0FITExPT0VCT0NBQUEudHJhY2V5aUBzY2NvYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwOTUzNjUyMjUuMTIwMS4zMjcwNi5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":99671,"nextInTopic":99674,"prevInTime":99672,"nextInTime":99674,"topicId":99638,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been watching this thread with much interest.

I too have a daughter<br/>\nwho exhibits symptoms of being dyslexic.  When she was in 1st grade in<br/>\npublic school she was put through a battery of tests.  I requested it<br/>\nbecause I was sure she was dyslexic after doing much research. They would<br/>\nonly tell me she had a learning disability and wanted to put her in<br/>\nresource!  I threw a fit and wouldn&#39;t allow the resource thing.  She<br/>\nstruggled so with reading and would fail the reading tests.  But if I read<br/>\nthe test to her she would ace it without hearing the multiple-choice<br/>\noptions.  (She could just tell you the answer.)  I pulled her out of public<br/>\nschool when she was 7.    Her memory of things she watches on TV. or sees at<br/>\nthe museums,etc. is incredible.  But let me tell her that her towel is the<br/>\none on the left she will put her hands on her head and say &quot;Oh! I am getting<br/>\nconfused!&quot;  She doesn&#39;t have much concept of time frames.  Asking her to do<br/>\nmore than one thing at a time just isn&#39;t going to happen.  I have learned to<br/>\nask one thing at a time and to break other things in life down to bite size<br/>\npieces.  Our local library has a ton of books on tape.  She loves Juni B.<br/>\nJones and she enjoys putting the CD in and following along in the book.  But<br/>\nsome of the books seem to go too fast for her to keep up so we use those for<br/>\nwhen we are in the car.<br/>\nI must admit I have moments of wanting to worry.  But then I remind myself<br/>\nthat she will find ways of putting things together in her own way (and<br/>\ntime).  But I do have one question for the group...... Will the lack of<br/>\nconcentration hinder her ability to learn all she can?  During all the<br/>\nbattery of tests I forgot to mention she WAS diagnosed as a severe ADD<br/>\nchild.  We tried the medication but to be honest I just couldn&#39;t feel good<br/>\nabout giving her a controlled narcotic.  My dh and I made the decision to<br/>\njust let her go at her on pace and ignore the &quot;well-meaning&quot; comments from<br/>\ngrand-parents.<br/>\n~Tracey I.<br/>\n&quot;Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre<br/>\nminds.&quot; Albert Einstein<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.766 / Virus Database: 513 - Release Date: 9/17/2004</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Dyslexia-long-help?","postDate":"1095433869","msgId":99671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhlLjE1NmE0YzdlLjJlN2M1ODhkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":99669,"nextInTopic":99673,"prevInTime":99670,"nextInTime":99672,"topicId":99638,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/16/04 10:48:37 PM, pennacres@redshift.bc.ca writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1758161547\">In a message dated 9/16/04 10:48:37 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pennacres@...\">pennacres@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; This is not to say I want to label,  change, treat, or school her.

Look at the heart of your daughter.  Look at her passions.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s living an unschooling life...doing what she loves.  Is she <br/>\ncontent and able to get from what world what she needs/desires in <br/>\nlife?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I could see in your above words that may need a shift <br/>\nis the fact that you seem to be focusing on your child&#39;s *learning* <br/>\ninstead of her *life.*  Your *approach*, as stated above (&quot;let her <br/>\ndevelop at her own speed, facilitate her learning by making things <br/>\navailable to her to support the ways she seems to absorb <br/>\ninformation&quot;) just seems to be lacking the very foundation of <br/>\nunschooling, to me:  Joy.  The Joy that comes from the child being <br/>\nfree to follow her heart, her passions...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a shift in your focus AWAY from all things *learning* to all <br/>\nthings *joyful* for your child would help you to see that All is <br/>\nWell...that your child Shines just as she is ~ no list of traits <br/>\nnecessary!<br/>\n<br/>\n***what  is &quot;different&quot; with her is that  if someone talks about &quot;how <br/>\nmany , or  how much or how long-while others might count or subtract <br/>\nor wonder or figure-she just watches or lets them do it.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy isn&#39;t that OK?  She&#39;s doing what she needs to do, processing it <br/>\nin her mind the way she needs to process it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the things that she exhibits are her own way of processing <br/>\ninformation.  If we didn&#39;t have lists of traits and labels and <br/>\nstandards that schools expect from our children, then we would more <br/>\nclearly be able to see that each child is different, each mind is <br/>\nprecious and unique, and there are no standard time-frames for <br/>\nspecific *learning*.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo along with shifting the focus of your days from *learning* to <br/>\n*life*, it&#39;s also important to live that life as if school doesn&#39;t <br/>\nexist.  Allow your child to be Free, and in the course of her Free <br/>\nlife she encounters challenges, you will be able to overcome those <br/>\nchallenges at that time together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t *make* challenges in her life when, from her view of the <br/>\nworld, there aren&#39;t any.    <br/>\n<br/>\n***Oh, yes Anneo she is &quot;sensativity issues&quot; but not so much now as <br/>\nher twin sister. the clothing, food, texture things are becoming  <br/>\neasier for her as she gets older.<br/>\nI did join  Shinewith unschooling as soon as it started , it was <br/>\ngreat at first but I unsubbed when  it got  a bit off track while <br/>\nyou  were  gone.

I want to understand her different  responses to the spoken, written word and the process of writing  and  know when and if I can help her and in what specific ways or if indeed there  are any specific ways.<br/>\n I know that much  of what is commonly understood as being &quot;necessary skills&quot; is a requirement for public school.<br/>\nOh, yes as for the &quot;math&quot; thing? what  is &quot;different&quot; with her is that  if someone talks about &quot;how many , or  how much or how long-while others might count or subtract or wonder or figure-she just watches or lets them do it. she has only recently really understood that the act of counting  is actually adding one more  to a number.Verbally. or when counting. Handling objects she does, easily.   Counting backwards-ie subtracting  one from the number she actually &quot;doesnt get it&quot;.verbally, out loud, handling objects she does. I dont think it is that unusual and it is not something we ever comment on but I just observe it as she plays. We dont do anything called math or use the word in everyday life.  We did try Math-U-See-just  the first couple of exercises in a fun way when they were 5-6 and it was totally meaningless and confusing to her.<br/>\nI dont plan on changing our unschooling-it works great for us in all ways.<br/>\nOh, yes Anneo she is &quot;sensativity issues&quot; but not so much now as her twin sister. the clothing, food, texture things are becoming  easier for her as she gets older.<br/>\nI did join  Shinewith unschooling as soon as it started , it was great at first but I unsubbed when  it got  a bit off track while you  were  gone.

For some,<br/>\ndyslexia is about how their visual system works, not which side of the<br/>\nbrain is being used.  I won&#39;t go into it here.  But again, IMHO, dyslexia<br/>\nis a label for kids who learn differently.  And I say -- what&#39;s wrong with<br/>\nthat?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, in my own experience, I don&#39;t believe that you need to train the<br/>\nbrain at the earliest age possible.  Yes, this is true if you&#39;re in the<br/>\nschool system and you don&#39;t want to be behind everyone else.

I didn&#39;t find a single thing on<br/>\nthis list that is a problem for a child, unless you happen to be in school<br/>\nand aren&#39;t measuring up to everyone else.  The only thing on this list that<br/>\nhas been a problem for me as an adult is the issue of getting left/right<br/>\nconfused.  This can be a problem if I&#39;m the navigator.  I just use my body<br/>\nand point, before I use my words.  My body never gets it wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything else on this list I found my own unique way of solving.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my advice is to let your daughter find her unique abilities, and to<br/>\nallow those to flourish.  You will be amazed what will come of them!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I have another thought.  If you did do some schooling wrt reading, it<br/>\nmay take her quite awhile to deschool from this experience.  As you said,<br/>\nshe resisted it in a big way.  It took me years and years to finally learn<br/>\nthe way that reading worked for me, and I&#39;m certain that the reason it took<br/>\nme so long was because I had been told it was suppose to happen another<br/>\nway.  Using Bob books and the &quot;How to Read...&quot; book were not the way for<br/>\nyour daughter, as she showed you.  And now, perhaps that&#39;s the only way she<br/>\nthinks of wrt reading.  Someday, she will want to read something, and<br/>\nsomeday it will click for her and she will figure out how it works for her.<br/>\nIf you can trust her, and be patient, it will be the best gift you can give<br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4261131,"authorName":"AnneO","from":"&quot;AnneO&quot; &lt;ohman@...&gt;","profile":"anneounschooler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Dyslexia-long-help?","postDate":"1095363538","msgId":99641,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNpY3E0aStvbmI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWM0OWMxNiQyNmUwZDk2MCQyZWUwYjVkMEBQZW5ubz4="},"prevInTopic":99638,"nextInTopic":99646,"prevInTime":99640,"nextInTime":99642,"topicId":99638,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Grace.

He spent much of <br/>\nhis days very frustrated over this fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remembered reading in *The Gift of Dyslexia* about working with <br/>\nclay ~ the book said that if kids could *feel* the way letters are <br/>\n*supposed to* be written, that would help them when writing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though the situation was different, I bought him some Sculpey.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe absolutely loved it and was so good at working with it.  He made <br/>\nevery single Pokemon (that was when there were only 150!) and we had <br/>\nthem displayed all over our home.<br/>\n<br/>\nA year or two later, he picked up a pencil again to draw, and found <br/>\nthat, at that time, what came out of his hand DID match what was in <br/>\nhis head.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may have been the time difference, but I do believe working with <br/>\nthe clay helped his mind and his hand to find common ground!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso ~ a few years ago he began drawing a comic strip.  It&#39;s adorable <br/>\nand really funny ~ about his brother&#39;s pet guinea pig.  If his <br/>\nwriting was completely illegible on the comic strip, I&#39;d tell him <br/>\nthat it looks great, but I can&#39;t read it!  He&#39;d either fix it and <br/>\nwrite more carefully, making absolute sure to make the letters <br/>\ncorrect, or he&#39;d ask me to write it for him.  So, because of his <br/>\ndesire to have people read his wonderful comic strip, his handwriting <br/>\nbecame more legible, and his letters would come out looking right <br/>\n(for that moment, anyway!).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs your daughter highly sensitive or non-typical in other ways <br/>\nbesides displaying dyslexic traits?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, you may be interested in looking into my group, Unschooling <br/>\nNon-Typical Children:<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n***She seldom is interested in reading much else although she does <br/>\noccasionally  read early level books,usually if we are in the car and <br/>\nnot much else there.***<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you read to her?  We listen to audio books all the time ~ where we <br/>\nlive, everything is far away (grocery store is 1/2 hour away), so we <br/>\nhave a lot of time in the car and we always have a book going.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso ~ because Jake loves literature, his dyslexic traits didn&#39;t stop <br/>\nhim from reading ~ just reading out loud.  He said it was a challenge <br/>\nfor him when the words had to go from the book to his brain and out <br/>\nhis mouth, but he had no trouble when he just read to himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for writing besides the comic strip, I&#39;ve always been his scribe.  <br/>\nHe would receive e-mails and I would type the replies for him.  He <br/>\nwrote stories by dictating them to me, as he found he *wrote* best by <br/>\npacing back and forth while he was thinking.  He even won a writing <br/>\ncontest at the library by dictating the story to me, checking to make <br/>\nsure I was spelling things correctly, and making sure I added enough <br/>\nexclamation points!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo *writing* is much more than the physical act ~ it&#39;s in your head <br/>\nand your heart and however it gets down on paper or in the computer <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really matter much.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Jake types at the computer himself a LOT.  He&#39;s the fastest one-<br/>\nfinger typist I know!  He&#39;s on a lot of message boards for things he <br/>\nloves ~ Pokemon, Neopets, etc.  He types e-mails.  And he still draws <br/>\nbeautifully ~ and makes his comic when he&#39;s inspired, also.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still makes letters and numbers backwards, but, as I said, it <br/>\nhasn&#39;t interfered with his life much ~ in fact, his creative, <br/>\nwonderful life wouldn&#39;t be what it was today if I had tried to *fix* <br/>\nhis unique traits, including his dyslexic tendencies.  It&#39;s part of <br/>\nWho He Is and part of what&#39;s in his heart and his mind...and that&#39;s <br/>\nalways been honored and celebrated, just the way it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe Well ~<br/>\nAnne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1160699,"authorName":"Penn Acres","from":"&quot;Penn Acres&quot; &lt;pennacres@...&gt;","profile":"mtnsky2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Dyslexia-long-help?","postDate":"1095357201","msgId":99638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWM0OWMxNiQyNmUwZDk2MCQyZWUwYjVkMEBQZW5ubz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":99641,"prevInTime":99637,"nextInTime":99639,"topicId":99638,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The post  below mine about dyslexia was received on another list.

I have removed identifying  info.<br/>\nOur Kara demonstrates most of these characteristics. She is 9<br/>\nWe unschool. We homeschooled from age 5 and half to 6 and half. <br/>\nShe spends a great deal of time on NeoPets. PlayStation-Harvest Moon. Videos.  Most of her reading &quot;skills&quot;  come through these . We used &quot;How to Read in 100 Lessons and Bob books when we homeschooled.)<br/>\nShe resisted all of this  in a huge way. She seldom is interested in reading much else although she does occasionally  read early level books,usually if we are in the car and not much else there.<br/>\nShe resists anything and everything to do with &quot;math&quot; or numbers even in ordinary life. we never present things as &quot;math&quot;. she simply has no interest. At all.<br/>\nI  am on most of the unschooling lists. I am hugely interested and motivated. I have read  and thought about the dyslexia discussions  as they arise on the lists, former Message board.<br/>\nI have read books on the subject. My approach has been  to let her develop at her own speed, facilitate her learning  by making things available to her  to support the ways she seems to absorb information.<br/>\n Indeed , I don,t see how else she could really &quot;learn&quot; if it wasnt  available  in the way she does &quot;learn&quot;.<br/>\nBut still, the list of identifying characteristics  fits her so well that I need to see if I am missing something  in all of this.<br/>\nIs there  acceptable &quot;help&quot; out there that is necessary for her to work this through  or can it be done this way -&quot;in her own way&quot;.<br/>\nWe are in a small isolated area so outside of the public school where they have &quot;remedial&quot; classes  there are no other resources.<br/>\n I have seen various &quot;excercises&quot; in some books on dyslexia. Are there unschoolers who have worked thru this without outside resources. I doubt she would want to participate and she has not ever brought the subject up.<br/>\nHowever, she says her friends call her &quot;Dory&quot; ( Finding Nemo ) because she can&#39;t remember things. so  she is not oblivious to it all.<br/>\nWould appreciate feedback from anyone who actually is or has  experienced some of this.<br/>\nGrace<br/>\nOn another cold and drizzly mountain morning.<br/>\n............................................................................<br/>\n <br/>\nDyslexia is always a possibility though because extreme fatigue <br/>\n<br/>\nwhile working with written words is definitely a symptom.  <br/>\nBasically, children with dyslexia have a big discrepancy between <br/>\ntheir language and non language I.Q.  The biggest problem seems to <br/>\nbe that they use the right side of the brain when reading.  The left <br/>\nside was meant for language (reading, writing etc) so using the <br/>\nright side isn&#39;t effective and very tiring for them.  It&#39;s like <br/>\nbeing right handed but writing for an extended period of time with <br/>\nthe left hand.  It&#39;s tiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to rule out any problems with the eyes first.  If <br/>\nthey don&#39;t find anything wrong, you could take them in for an <br/>\nevaluation with a edu-psychologist to pinpoint the problem for your <br/>\nown personal use.  If they do have dyslexia, there are techniques <br/>\nand programs to retrain the brain to use the left side while reading <br/>\nbut the younger you get them, the better long term results you&#39;ll <br/>\nget.  It makes a huge difference and after awhile, they don&#39;t get as <br/>\ntired.  Dyslexia is inherited so if you have a parent, grandparent, <br/>\nbrother, sister etc who still has difficulty reading and spelling, <br/>\nthe risk is there.  If not, that&#39;s great.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes My Child Have Dyslexia?<br/>\nIndividuals with dyslexia usually have some of the following <br/>\ncharacteristics: <br/>\n    <br/>\nDifficulty with oral language  Late in learning to talk <br/>\nDifficulty pronouncing words <br/>\nDifficulty acquiring vocabulary or using age-appropriate grammar <br/>\nDifficulty following directions <br/>\nConfusion with before/after, right/left, and so on <br/>\nDifficulty learning the alphabet, nursery rhymes, or songs <br/>\nDifficulty understanding concepts and relationships <br/>\n   - <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nDifficulty with reading  Difficulty learning to read <br/>\nDifficulty identifying or generating rhyming words or counting <br/>\nsyllables in words (Phonological Awareness) <br/>\nDifficulty with hearing and manipulating sounds in words (Phonemic <br/>\nAwareness) <br/>\nDifficulty distinguishing different sounds in words (Auditory <br/>\nDiscrimination) <br/>\nDifficulty in learning the sounds of letters <br/>\nDifficulty remembering names and/or the order of letters when <br/>\nreading <br/>\nReverses letters or the order of letters when reading <br/>\nMisreads or omits common little words <br/>\n&quot;Stumbles&quot; through longer words <br/>\nPoor reading comprehension during oral or silent reading <br/>\nSlow, laborious oral reading <br/>\n   -  <br/>\n<br/>\n   Difficulty with written language<br/>\nTrouble putting ideas on paper <br/>\nMany spelling mistakes <br/>\nMay do well on weekly spelling tests, but there are many spelling <br/>\nmistakes in daily work <br/>\nDifficulty in proofreading <br/>\n   -  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99621,"nextTopicId":99678}}
