I received that same e-mail<br/>\nmessage on my private e-mail today also. I guess I just <br/>\nwant to ackowledge that I am a Christian unschooler(a bit<br/>\nof an anomaly in my neck of the woods) and I have benefited<br/>\nso much form the richness on this list. I realized early on<br/>\nthat my religious beliefs, although completely integral to<br/>\nmy daily life, were not necessarily shared by all the folks<br/>\non the list, nor did I expect them to be. Still, my educational<br/>\nphilosophies and passions for my children to grow and learn<br/>\nin natural ways were echoed daily in the posts of the<br/>\nunschooling parents. This is a huge encouragement to me.<br/>\nI feel very &quot;other&quot; in my homeschooling community. In the<br/>\nstrongly Christian groups, the policy is &quot;school-at-home&quot;<br/>\nso I don&#39;t fit perfectly there. In the diverse, freedom<br/>\noriented groups, my faith might be one of many, so I dont <br/>\ntotally fit in there. SO WHAT? If my goal is to only hang<br/>\nwith those who are exactly like me in every possible way, <br/>\nwhat am I teaching my children? That the ultimate goal is<br/>\nto find friends that are exactly like you, so you can be<br/>\ncomfortable at all times? ACK!! I am unapologetic about <br/>\nmy Christian faith, but I consider it completely in keeping<br/>\nwith that faith to be completely respectful of other people&#39;s<br/>\ndiffering faiths and beliefs. I guess this hit a nerve for<br/>\nme, huh? I&#39;ve been pretty quiet, soaking up the good stuff.<br/>\nI would hate to lose it, I suppose.<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nmom to jolie, lucy and mara<br/>\nout of the closet jesus freak</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6651,"nextTopicId":6670}}
