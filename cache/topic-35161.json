I have sort of an unusual<br/>\n&gt; situation on my hands, and would greatly appreciate any advice you<br/>\n&gt; can give me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve vacillated in my approach to home learning, but basically have<br/>\n&gt; remained somewhat of a &#39;radical&#39; unschooler, in that I can barely<br/>\n&gt; stomache anything that even looks like &#39;school&#39;.  I don&#39;t judge<br/>\n&gt; anyone else for thier different approaches to home learning, but for<br/>\n&gt; our family, this just &#39;fits&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I will definately &#39;bend&#39; in this particular situation, which<br/>\n&gt; will &#39;probably&#39; be temporary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I live in Oregon, and tried to access the &#39;orsig&#39; group, but it was<br/>\n&gt; unavailable for some reason.  I don&#39;t know of any other groups for my<br/>\n&gt; state, so I decided to come here, because I&#39;m an unschooler, and you<br/>\n&gt; have lots of members for me to draw advice from.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m raising my grandson, and we&#39;ve been, (for the most part),<br/>\n&gt; unschooling since he was a baby.  He&#39;s almost 7 now, and smart as a<br/>\n&gt; whip, a whiz with math, yet slow to warm up to reading, or any type<br/>\n&gt; of &#39;busywork&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oregon is a homeschooling friendly state, and basically stays out of<br/>\n&gt; our business, with the exception of testing every three years.  By<br/>\n&gt; the time my grandson is seven, I will need to file an &#39;intent to<br/>\n&gt; homeschool&#39; with the school district, and have him tested every three<br/>\n&gt; years from there on out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t been involved in any homeschool support groups, because<br/>\n&gt; there just hasn&#39;t been the need for it thus far, and some of the<br/>\n&gt; things I&#39;ve read about &#39;cliques&#39;, and &#39;elitism&#39; in some homeschool<br/>\n&gt; groups, I don&#39;t know if I ever will join one, because I&#39;m very<br/>\n&gt; unconventional in my beliefs and in our home learning, I just don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see me finding a group that would be supportive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a friend who homeschools her children, in much the same way as<br/>\n&gt; I do, and we get together often for outings and such, and that seems<br/>\n&gt; to satisfy my grandson&#39;s need for social interaction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, at long last, here&#39;s the situation.  Another grandson, from<br/>\n&gt; another state...California, who is almost eight, is here with us now,<br/>\n&gt; and will be with us at least until the end of the school year.  There<br/>\n&gt; were some serious personal problems in his family that prompted his<br/>\n&gt; coming to us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The two of them get along wonderfully, except for the<br/>\n&gt; usual &#39;bullying&#39; type stuff that he learned in public school, and in<br/>\n&gt; his life thus far.  But the new grandson responds beautifully to<br/>\n&gt; being loved and respected, and has a sweet spirit in him that just<br/>\n&gt; needs a little more encouragement than most, because his life has<br/>\n&gt; been nothing but unpredictable, neglected, and emotionally abused.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He has expressed a great desire to be homeschooled with the other<br/>\n&gt; one, rather than go to our local public elementary school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe this would be the best for everyone concerned, but when his<br/>\n&gt; mother disenrolled him in California, she was told that he would have<br/>\n&gt; to recieve a passing grade to be enrolled again in California next<br/>\n&gt; year.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have a clue where to begin to find out what the requirements<br/>\n&gt; are for a passing grade in California for second grade.  I know I can<br/>\n&gt; have him tested here, in Oregon, but I&#39;m sure they test for Oregon<br/>\n&gt; requirements.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a great likelihood that he might remain here with us in<br/>\n&gt; Oregon after the current family crisis is over, but should things<br/>\n&gt; improve enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; send him home without the requirements to enter third grade in<br/>\n&gt; California.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any advice you have would be so greatly appreciated!

But that means &quot;can&#39;t be legally <br/>\nhomeschooled in that state.&quot;  If they move to Texas or New Mexico it matters <br/>\nnot one whit what the old state said or thought or intended.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;but should things <br/>\nimprove enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nsend him home without the requirements to enter third grade in <br/>\nCalifornia.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a semi-secret thing called &quot;social promotion.&quot;  What it means is <br/>\nthat there is a legal liability to the schools if a much-older child harms a <br/>\nmuch-younger/smaller child.  Particularly, historically, a problem was <br/>\ncombining pubescent boys with younger children.  That&#39;s part of why <br/>\nmidschools came to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if he&#39;s more than one year past the age of being in second grade, they <br/>\nwon&#39;t put him in second grade.  They&#39;ll put him in third by age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem or concern might be &quot;being behind&quot; in third grade.  If he can <br/>\nread well and he knows addition and subtraction, there&#39;s nothing to &quot;be <br/>\nbehind&quot; in--the science and history aren&#39;t continuous, and even if they <br/>\nweriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you say &quot;He was homeschooled in Oregon last year,&quot; they will just put <br/>\nhim in by age, too, most likely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it was just a threat by the district to try to scare her out of <br/>\ndisenrollment?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77610158,"authorName":"Bonni Sollars","from":"Bonni Sollars &lt;BSOLLARS@...&gt;","profile":"truuluvv","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unusual unschooling situation","postDate":"1019058364","msgId":35276,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNDE3LjExNDYyNC4tODE4NDEuMC5ic29sbGFyc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35199,"nextInTopic":35315,"prevInTime":35275,"nextInTime":35277,"topicId":35161,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Ruby, I m Bonni and I live in Oregon, too.

I have sort of an unusual <br/>\nsituation on my hands, and would greatly appreciate any advice you <br/>\ncan give me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve vacillated in my approach to home learning, but basically have <br/>\nremained somewhat of a &#39;radical&#39; unschooler, in that I can barely <br/>\nstomache anything that even looks like &#39;school&#39;.  I don&#39;t judge <br/>\nanyone else for thier different approaches to home learning, but for <br/>\nour family, this just &#39;fits&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I will definately &#39;bend&#39; in this particular situation, which <br/>\nwill &#39;probably&#39; be temporary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Oregon, and tried to access the &#39;orsig&#39; group, but it was <br/>\nunavailable for some reason.  I don&#39;t know of any other groups for my <br/>\nstate, so I decided to come here, because I&#39;m an unschooler, and you <br/>\nhave lots of members for me to draw advice from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m raising my grandson, and we&#39;ve been, (for the most part), <br/>\nunschooling since he was a baby.  He&#39;s almost 7 now, and smart as a <br/>\nwhip, a whiz with math, yet slow to warm up to reading, or any type <br/>\nof &#39;busywork&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOregon is a homeschooling friendly state, and basically stays out of <br/>\nour business, with the exception of testing every three years.  By <br/>\nthe time my grandson is seven, I will need to file an &#39;intent to <br/>\nhomeschool&#39; with the school district, and have him tested every three <br/>\nyears from there on out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been involved in any homeschool support groups, because <br/>\nthere just hasn&#39;t been the need for it thus far, and some of the <br/>\nthings I&#39;ve read about &#39;cliques&#39;, and &#39;elitism&#39; in some homeschool <br/>\ngroups, I don&#39;t know if I ever will join one, because I&#39;m very <br/>\nunconventional in my beliefs and in our home learning, I just don&#39;t <br/>\nsee me finding a group that would be supportive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who homeschools her children, in much the same way as <br/>\nI do, and we get together often for outings and such, and that seems <br/>\nto satisfy my grandson&#39;s need for social interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, at long last, here&#39;s the situation.  Another grandson, from <br/>\nanother state...California, who is almost eight, is here with us now, <br/>\nand will be with us at least until the end of the school year.  There <br/>\nwere some serious personal problems in his family that prompted his <br/>\ncoming to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two of them get along wonderfully, except for the <br/>\nusual &#39;bullying&#39; type stuff that he learned in public school, and in <br/>\nhis life thus far.  But the new grandson responds beautifully to <br/>\nbeing loved and respected, and has a sweet spirit in him that just <br/>\nneeds a little more encouragement than most, because his life has <br/>\nbeen nothing but unpredictable, neglected, and emotionally abused.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has expressed a great desire to be homeschooled with the other <br/>\none, rather than go to our local public elementary school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe this would be the best for everyone concerned, but when his <br/>\nmother disenrolled him in California, she was told that he would have <br/>\nto recieve a passing grade to be enrolled again in California next <br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a clue where to begin to find out what the requirements <br/>\nare for a passing grade in California for second grade.  I know I can <br/>\nhave him tested here, in Oregon, but I&#39;m sure they test for Oregon <br/>\nrequirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a great likelihood that he might remain here with us in <br/>\nOregon after the current family crisis is over, but should things <br/>\nimprove enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nsend him home without the requirements to enter third grade in <br/>\nCalifornia.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice you have would be so greatly appreciated!
