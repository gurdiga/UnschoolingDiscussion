I wrote &quot;How Children Learn&quot; hoping to help introduce<br/>\nthe natural, effortless, and effective ways of learning of the happy home<br/>\ninto the schools.  At times I fear I may only have helped to bring the<br/>\nstrained, self-conscious, painful and ineffective ways of learning of the<br/>\nschools into the home.  To parents I say, above all else, don&#39;t let your<br/>\nhome become some terrible miniature copy of the school.  No lesson plans!<br/>\n No quizzes!  No tests!  No report cards!   Even leaving your kids alone<br/>\nwould be better; at least they could figure out some things on their own.<br/>\n Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much as you<br/>\ncan.  Ask questions to find out something about the world itself, not to<br/>\nfind out whether or not someone knows it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93654,"nextTopicId":93736}}
