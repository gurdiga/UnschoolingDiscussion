You need &quot;aunts&quot; and &quot;uncles&quot; and even more <br/>\n&quot;grandparents&quot; involved, especially with all the different needs your <br/>\nkids have. So if your family cannot spare the time, buy yourself an <br/>\nextended family. Get yourself students who may want to have some P/T <br/>\nwork as mother&#39;s helpers and don&#39;t get into the trap of depending on <br/>\none. Get yourself 2 or 3 and keep them on call. Start relegating your <br/>\nkids to others, even more than what you do now and do it fast. A <br/>\nburnt-out, depressed mother will be detrimental to everybody at home <br/>\n--that&#39;s why you do not want to get to that state.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went through an unconventional route to deal with my a post-partum <br/>\ndepression that turned into what my family doctor called a pervasive, <br/>\nlow-grade depression. You&#39;re functional but your body is maxxed out <br/>\nwith the stress, anger and sorrow. He is an MD and a homeopath and <br/>\nguided me through my recovery with constitutional remedies and some <br/>\nserious changes in my diet. Instead of doing (cognitive) psychotherapy <br/>\nagain, I decided I wanted something deeper and more physical, so I went <br/>\nback to taking yoga lessons (which include chanting and meditation) and <br/>\nI got myself to a gym as well. And I went back to chiropractic <br/>\nadjustments once a week. This meant I needed to some serious rejuggling <br/>\nof not just my schedule but OUR schedule. This was not just my priority <br/>\nbut it need to be our family&#39;s priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond these physical changes though, I took a big step at ensuring <br/>\nthat my children were covered in times I needed a break. I need to work <br/>\nbecause I feel like I am going insane if I do not. I&#39;ve spent the last <br/>\nyear basically unschooling in some of the kinds of web development <br/>\ntechnology Mark knows little of and that I love because they involved <br/>\ndeveloping social software. You know I live with a geek when my deeper <br/>\nlearning of coding has re-ignited our relationship. Now I am not just <br/>\nthe advisor / manager, but a fellow Dilbert as well :) I&#39;ve also been <br/>\nwriting more (which I used to do for a living since forever), and <br/>\nbasically going back to the kinds of intellectual activities I forgot I <br/>\nloved after having kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Evan was about 8 months I knew something was wrong with me, I was <br/>\nso miserable. So at that point we accepted Bena in our lives. Neither <br/>\nof our families are that interested in kids, so we&#39;ve had to go out and <br/>\nseek the aide of, and I have to say, 2 fantastic women who I just thank <br/>\nthe universe for having around. One is Bena, who was our long-term <br/>\nbabysitter after I basically freaked out and felt that Evan&#39;s colic, <br/>\ncoupled with my post-partum depression were not a good combination. She <br/>\nstarted part-time but in the 6 years she&#39;s been with us, I&#39;ve attempted <br/>\nto be an entrepeneur and even go back to full-time work after Aidan was <br/>\nborn. So during some of those years she has been with us for more than <br/>\n20 hours week. Ironically, because at these times Mark was <br/>\ntransitioning out of the corporate world and into the art world, she <br/>\nreally has been crucial in our having the time to work and create and <br/>\nbe with our children all at the same time (and all together in the less <br/>\nthan 800sq feet we rent here in nyc). Bena now is only with us on <br/>\nFridays. She takes the kids to the library, museum or workshops or what <br/>\nnot. It&#39;s their special time together and they really look forward to <br/>\nseeing her on Fridays.<br/>\n<br/>\nIshe is our &#39;nightime&#39; sitter. She lives close to us and she was the <br/>\ncool nursery school teacher that Evan had in his 1 year at &#39;school&#39;. <br/>\nShe was a child-actor. She was &#39;tutored&#39; by a teacher that had the <br/>\n&#39;open classroom&#39; approach that Sandra talks about because her mom is a <br/>\npre-k teacher that also practices the same. If Bena is like an aunt, <br/>\nIshe is like a younger cousin. I love having her around because when we <br/>\nare together, I don&#39;t have to talk like a mom, I&#39;m just another one of <br/>\nthe girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are our homeschooling and schooling friends. Tanya and <br/>\nHannah are schooling moms I know from when our oldest kids were 2 years <br/>\nold and we all lived her in the East Village. Hannah & her family moved <br/>\nto New Jersey. Still, they&#39;re like family and for them I have no qualms <br/>\nin forking over $100+ for a car rental to spend the day , or even <br/>\nbetter, an overnight. With Tanya I can leave the kids, run errands and <br/>\ncome back to pick up kids from a playdate. She can also do the same <br/>\nwith us. Same with John and Ailey. He&#39;s the unschooling granddad of <br/>\nAiley and I spend more time with them than with his wife (Ailey&#39;s <br/>\ngrandmother, who still works full time). I either pick her up and keep <br/>\nher with us for the day or they do the same with the guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout them I&#39;d have no life and my kids would have an unhappy, <br/>\nresentful and depressed mom. I grew up having a lot of family and <br/>\nfriends in my life so I still feel like our life is barren of family <br/>\nand friends. But our lives are not conventional anymore. Mark and I <br/>\nhate the idea of parenting alone and being a nuclear family. We&#39;re just <br/>\ntrying to find a way to tribalize our homebase, and find more creative <br/>\nways at creating a support system for our kids and ultimately ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nl i z a<br/>\n=========================<br/>\nwww.culturekitchen.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":107749866,"authorName":"veejie72","from":"&quot;veejie72&quot; &lt;berryhead@...&gt;","profile":"veejie72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: more from a bad unschooling mother","postDate":"1074048906","msgId":88821,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1MmIyYSs1dGdlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJkLjNiNDlkNzE4LjJkMzVlOTQ0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":88819,"nextInTopic":88834,"prevInTime":88820,"nextInTime":88822,"topicId":88746,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Request for Amey: Can you PLEASE stop referring to yourself as a bad unschooling mother ?

I&#39;m more of a social person, so I like to get out for some adult conversation. I don&#39;t know what else to suggest. Some people are manicure, facial or massage people--some of us would like to be too if we had the $$$. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own reaction to this post would be to find some way to lose some of the obligations that you do have, or at least ease some of them. My first thought would be your part time job. Is there any way you could cut your hours back? Maybe you guys need it financially, I don&#39;t know. You say you enjoy it, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be fulfilling the self-time need.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could have someone in to take on some of the household chores instead of babysitting? Maybe having the cleaning or grocery shopping or laundry off your plate might help some. If you didn&#39;t have the more mundane things hanging over your head, maybe you&#39;d be more relaxed when you were with your kids. I know when I&#39;m thinking that things *need* to be done, it&#39;s really excruciating to do those time-consuming things with my kids, especially since I&#39;m a total multi-tasker. So from that standpoint, I can totally understand what you&#39;re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe just having this board to vent and read might help you with some self time. That&#39;s why I like it--I can grab it in bits and snatches during the day when the kids don&#39;t need my immediate attention. Sorry again for making assumptions, and thank you for posting the details that paint the picture of your reality. Makes it a whole lot easier to understand where you&#39;re coming from!<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n  Amey wrote:<br/>\n  I&#39;ve appreciated all of the follow-up comments and <br/>\n  suggestions.

I&#39;ve appreciated all of the follow-up comments and <br/>\nsuggestions.  Here&#39;s some more info.  I didn&#39;t want to write this <br/>\noriginally because of I didn&#39;t want to post a long message, but since <br/>\nI was asked . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I was asked by Kit if I&#39;m writing an article or doing <br/>\nresearch.  The answer to both of these is &quot;no.&quot;  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\nhaving the time to do these things.  I know that you don&#39;t know me, <br/>\nbut rest assured, if you see a posting from me, I will tell you about <br/>\nany motivations like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was basically looking for was suggestions for how to balance <br/>\nthe need for time for myself with the guilty feelings that I <br/>\nexperience when I&#39;m not always wanting to jump up and interact with <br/>\nmy kids and help them learn.  Here&#39;s some background info.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have five children:  <br/>\n1.  A 10 year old son who is BRILLIANT when it comes to physics, the <br/>\nAmerican Revolution, talking about his feelings, et al.  He has an <br/>\nUNBELIEVABLE ability to intuit math and physics.  He&#39;s incredible.  <br/>\nAt the same time, he can&#39;t read or write and we&#39;re sure he&#39;s <br/>\nsomewhere on the Asperger&#39;s continuum.  It&#39;s because of him that we <br/>\nunschool because there&#39;s NO WAY, absolutely NO WAY that he could <br/>\nlearn any other way.   He has real issues with anger, rage, and <br/>\nparanoia at the same time.  This son goes to biofeedback therapy once <br/>\na week to work on these issues.  I used to take him (along with the <br/>\nother children), but now my dad takes him once a week, which is a <br/>\nHUGE help for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  A 7-year old son who is jolly, happy, and a very traditional <br/>\nlearner.  This child loves workbooks, planned lessons, and <br/>\ntraditional schoolwork.  He loves design and architecture and beauty <br/>\nand engineering.  He has severe verbal dyspraxia and has gone to <br/>\nspeech therapy for almost four years, and probably has 1-2 years to <br/>\ngo.  My dad is going to take him to therapy this semester, too.  <br/>\nSomeone mentioned an online article about himif you want to see<br/>\ntwo photos of a beautiful child, go to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://einside.kent.edu/article.asp?aid=287\">http://einside.kent.edu/article.asp?aid=287</a><br/>\n<br/>\n3.  A 4-year old daughter who will probably be much like our 7-year <br/>\nold.  She has wanted to be a doctor since she&#39;s been 3.  She is smart <br/>\nas a WHIP.  She pores over anything involving medicine.  She is also <br/>\na girlie-girl, and if I hadn&#39;t given birth to her at home (our last <br/>\nthree bio children were born at home), I would have SWORN there was a <br/>\nhospital mix-up because I&#39;m NOT a girlie-girl (although I confess to <br/>\nreally getting into it because of her influence!).  She&#39;s REALLY <br/>\nfeisty.  That&#39;s a good word for herfeisty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three of these older children go to a motor development program <br/>\nfor nine weeks each semester, mainly because of the first son&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  A 14-month old daughter who is great at toddling and eating real <br/>\nfood, although she&#39;s so tiny she&#39;s not even on the charts.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  A 12-month old niece who has lived with us since she&#39;s been one <br/>\nmonth old.  At the end of this month, we will attend a custody <br/>\nhearing and will probably end up with legal custody of her.  She&#39;s an <br/>\nabsolute JOY and we love her to pieces. We believe that her living <br/>\nwith us is the best thing for her (long, sad story).  At the same <br/>\ntime, this past year has been UNBELIEVABLY stressful because of the <br/>\nemotions of dealing with a child in the custody of child protective <br/>\nservices and all that entails, and having to watch the anguish of her <br/>\nparents.  As much as we love her, we would prefer that her own <br/>\nparents could manage their lives well enough to have custody of her, <br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t appear to be in the cards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a computer network engineer at a university.  I&#39;m a <br/>\npart-time (20 hours/week) librarian at a university.  I love my job <br/>\nand he loves his.  After 13.5 years of marriage, I still refer to my <br/>\nhusband as a saint and tell people that he walks on water.  He&#39;s <br/>\nabsolutely WONDERFUL.  He walks in the door after working all day (at <br/>\na really stressful job) and takes over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to unschool, as stated above, because of the needs of our <br/>\nfirstborn, and it just made sense.  I lack a local support group, <br/>\nthough, and joined this e-group for its ideas and insights.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan from VA asked what life is like for me on a daily basis.  It&#39;s <br/>\nhectic, really hectic.  Taking care of two babies is fun and a <br/>\nblessing, but the emotional stress of the situation around our niece <br/>\n(which will HOPEFULLY ease somewhat soon) has been really hard.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s a TON of physical work to be done, although it&#39;s getting <br/>\neasier as the babies are older and our children help with dishes, <br/>\npicking up, and cleaning the house.  PLUS, coping with the anger and <br/>\nrage of my first son is really hard.  Really, really, really hard.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to imagine what it&#39;s like unless you have a child like <br/>\nthis.  My mother, who taught first grade for 33 years, and my sister, <br/>\nwho has taught for 27 years, have both told me that they&#39;ve NEVER <br/>\nseen a child with issues like his.  Believe me, he doesn&#39;t see this <br/>\nbehavior from either my husband or myself.  Back to my son, his <br/>\nbiofeedback training (one full year of it, and at least another six <br/>\nmonths to go) has REALLY, really helped him, but he will always have <br/>\nattitude and anger issues.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to answer what life is like on a daily basis: it&#39;s busy.  Our <br/>\nniece&#39;s parents are scheduled to come 12 hours/week to visit.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t always come, but it&#39;s in the back of our minds that they COULD <br/>\ncome.  Plus, we have social workers coming and going all the time.  <br/>\nPlus, all the paperwork that goes with this situation.  Plus, all the <br/>\nwork of running a big house with five children under ten.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy greatest joy is reading to my children and watching them create <br/>\nand make things.  My greatest fear and anxiety is trying to figure <br/>\nout if my UNBELIEVABLY gifted 10 year old isn&#39;t reading because I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t taken the time to help him figure it out, or if he&#39;s just not <br/>\nready, or if there&#39;s something holding him back (we did 26 weeks of <br/>\nvision therapy a few years ago) that if we could just resolve, he&#39;d <br/>\nstart to read and write.  Right now, if I ask him to read or write <br/>\nmore than two sentences, he goes &quot;ballistic&quot; and is unbelievably <br/>\ndefiant and combative.  So, most of the time, I don&#39;t ask him to read <br/>\nor write anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, in the back of my mind, I have this CONSTANT fear that they <br/>\n(especially the ten-year old) will end up not able to take care of <br/>\nthemselves as adults.  If I KNEW that they will turn out able to <br/>\nsupport themselves, I could relax a bit.  I don&#39;t have other friends <br/>\nwho are homeschooling.  Most of the homeschool support groups are for <br/>\nchurch-goers and we are more secular.  Plus, I can&#39;t imagine having <br/>\nthe time to go to a weekly or bi-weekly meeting.  It would mean <br/>\nscheduling around my work schedule, and our niece&#39;s parents visits <br/>\nand social workers&#39; visits, and taking all the children, OR, if I <br/>\nwent alone, my husband would then be left with all the childcare <br/>\nresponsibilities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSusan from VA asked how I&#39;m juggling it all and if I find time for <br/>\nmyself.  In a nutshell, I juggle it all by working really hard all <br/>\nthe time.  I don&#39;t find a lot of time for myself (nor does my<br/>\nhusband-he has even LESS time for himself)  and that&#39;s what<br/>\nled to my original post.  I absolutely know that this time is short-<br/>\nlived and there&#39;s a HUGE part of me that loves this phase and I <br/>\nabsolutely LOVE watching my kids create things and learn.  When we <br/>\ntake them places, people are BLOWN away by their attentiveness and <br/>\nthe kinds of questions they ask.  So, on the one hand, I KNOW that <br/>\nunschooling is working.  It&#39;s still really hard when they&#39;re not <br/>\nreading and writing and I confess that I feel some guilt when I think <br/>\nthat perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m not more attentive and don&#39;t always <br/>\njump up and interact with them more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd wrote, &quot;Someone has to serve them.   If you choose to be <br/>\ntheir learning facilitator, it&#39;s going to take some time and effort <br/>\nto facilitate their learning.  You can do it lovingly or <br/>\nresentfully.  The former would be better for all involved!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree totally.  I WANT to serve them lovingly.  The &quot;time and <br/>\neffort&quot; part is what&#39;s hardfind both.  Also, in order to get to<br/>\nthat loving space, I need to have some time so that I feel that I <br/>\nhave the reserves to offer them.  I can&#39;t figure out how to find time <br/>\nto give ME time so that I can give THEM time.  I&#39;ve read and <br/>\nimplemented a TON of books and ideas about simplification and <br/>\norganization (in fact, I&#39;ve given presentations on the latter!)  <br/>\nWe&#39;re really well-organizedabout as much as we can be.  It&#39;s the <br/>\nonly way we can keep things going!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you that I want to go to the Peabody, MA conference this <br/>\nyear (we&#39;ve already plotted out a vacation revolving around science <br/>\nmuseums and Revolutionary War sites on the way there and back) <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m REALLY in need of being around others who are unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I don&#39;t really have a follow-up question, although if anyone has <br/>\nany tips for finding space and time to get into a more loving and <br/>\ngiving space, please pass them on.  I told my husband last night that <br/>\nI&#39;d love to go on a cruise with him, but we can&#39;t figure out a way to <br/>\nget a babysitter for a week, nor do we want to leave the children <br/>\n(especially the babies) for that long.  Getting a babysitter is not <br/>\nas easy as it soundsbecause of our niece&#39;s situation, any<br/>\nbabysitter has to pass a police check, and a child abuse check.  I <br/>\nhave two friends that have been cleared so far, but teenagers are not <br/>\na possibility, and we can only ask our friends to babysit so often, <br/>\nand we reserve those times for when we REALLY need it (to run <br/>\nerrands, attend court hearings, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forgive me for sounding like I&#39;m whining.  I actually really <br/>\nlike my life and being busy and I adore my husband and children.  At <br/>\nthe same time, since I was asked for me details, I wanted to present <br/>\nyou with more information.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmey</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65958,"nextTopicId":88852}}
