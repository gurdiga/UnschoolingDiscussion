It reminds us to keep sight of what is really important in our lives, enjoy.<br/>\n        Candy Oliver<br/>\nI ran into a stranger as he passed by, <br/>\n&quot;Oh excuse me please&quot; was my reply. <br/>\nHe said, &quot;Please excuse me too; <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t watching for you.&quot; <br/>\nWe were very polite, this stranger and I. <br/>\nWe went on our way saying good-bye. <br/>\nBut at home a difference is told, <br/>\nhow we treat our loved ones, young and old. <br/>\nLater that day, cooking the evening meal, <br/>\nMy son stood beside me very still. <br/>\nAs I turned, I nearly knocked him down. <br/>\n&quot;Move out of the way,&quot; I said with a frown. <br/>\nHe walked away, his little heart broken. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize how harshly I&#39;d spoken. <br/>\nWhile I lay awake in bed, <br/>\nGod&#39;s still small voice came to me and said, <br/>\n&quot;While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use, <br/>\nBut the children you love, you seem to abuse. <br/>\nGo and look on the kitchen floor, <br/>\nYou&#39;ll find some flowers there by the door. <br/>\nThose are the flowers he brought for you. <br/>\nHe picked them himself: pink, yellow and blue. <br/>\nHe stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise, <br/>\nand you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes.&quot; <br/>\nBy this time, I felt very small, <br/>\nand now my tears began to fall. <br/>\nI quietly went and knelt by his bed; <br/>\n&quot;Wake up, little one, wake up,&quot; I said. &quot; <br/>\nAre these the flowers you picked for me?&quot; <br/>\nHe smiled, &quot;I found &#39;em, out by the tree. <br/>\nI picked &#39;em because they&#39;re pretty like you. <br/>\nI knew you&#39;d like &#39;em, especially the blue.&quot; <br/>\nI said, &quot;Son, I&#39;m very sorry for the way I acted today; <br/>\nI shouldn&#39;t have yelled at you that way.&quot; <br/>\nHe said, &quot;Oh, Mom, that&#39;s okay. I love you anyway.&quot; <br/>\nI said, &quot;Son, I love you too, <br/>\nand I do like the flowers, especially the blue.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company that we are working <br/>\nfor would easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family we left <br/>\nbehind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to think <br/>\nof it, we pour ourselves more into work than to our own family an unwise <br/>\ninvestment indeed, don&#39;t you think? So what is behind the story? Do you <br/>\nknow what the word FAMILY means? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30836,"nextTopicId":31056}}
