This is a reminder that the Early Bird Deadline for registering  <br/>\nfor the Northeast Unschooling Conference in Wakefield, Massachusetts August <br/>\n27 -  30 is tomorrow, May 1.  This is also the deadline to apply for full <br/>\nand  partial registration scholarships. Early Bird registration are eligible <br/>\nfor the  raffle for the cool gift basket stuffed with great stuff, worth over <br/>\n$150.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also encourage reserving your hotel rooms as soon as possible even if you <br/>\n don&#39;t anticipate being able to make the early registration deadline, <br/>\nbecause the  rooms in our block are going fast. If it looks like we have a need I <br/>\nmay be able  to increase the block, but the longer we wait, the less likely <br/>\nit is.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m really looking forward to this year&#39;s conference. We have great  <br/>\npresenters, including the elusive Rue Kream, Madeline Rains, the Lovejoys, and  <br/>\nmany more. In addition to those presentations, we&#39;ll have a bunch of panel  <br/>\ndiscussions where we can talk about some of the biggest issues that <br/>\nunschoolers  face right now. The hotel is gorgeous, and we&#39;ll have lots of space, with <br/>\na  gaming room and an arts, crafts, and creativity room, and lots of great  <br/>\nfunshops, including a duct tape funshop with the amazing Rick Rossing. <br/>\n <br/>\nLet me tell you about the entertainment. On our opening night we&#39;ll have a  <br/>\ngreat dance and Karaoke party led by a good friend of mine, Jean Callahan, <br/>\nwho  does this professionally.  Friday night a family of grown unschoolers  <br/>\nfrom Rhode Island who have a Celtic folk band called Fishing with Finnegan <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fishingwithfinnegan.com/_\">http://www.fishingwithfinnegan.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fishingwithfinnegan.com/)\">http://www.fishingwithfinnegan.com/)</a>  <br/>\nwill  be performing for us. Saturday will be our own Talent Show, always <br/>\nwith lots of  surprises.<br/>\n <br/>\nAll weekend there&#39;ll be space for our Untrepreneurs to sell their wares.  <br/>\nThen there&#39;s the raffle and the silent auction, and most of all, an amazing  <br/>\ncommunity of unschoolers.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s so much more! Please register soon, and, as always if you have any  <br/>\nquestions or ideas, please give me a call or an email.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn  <br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the  Northeast Unschooling Conference August 27-30, 2009 in <br/>\nWakefield, Massachusetts  _www.northeastunschoolingconference.com_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Big savings on Dell XPS Laptops and <br/>\nDesktops!(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1219491521x1201306563/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.double\">http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1219491521x1201306563/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.double</a><br/>\nclick.net%2Fclk%3B214102108%3B35952091%3Bs)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44468,"nextTopicId":44470}}
