I love him truly and deeply but could pinch<br/>\nhis head off about half the time.  Something that has helped is to get him<br/>\nto brainstorm ideas.  Example from yesterday:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am taking Zach and Adriane to meet their grandparents half-way between our<br/>\nhomes so they can spend the week with them.  Two older cousins are also<br/>\nmeeting so 6 people and their luggage will be riding for over 5 hours<br/>\ncrammed into my parents&#39; car to get back to the Texas panhandle.  Zach<br/>\nwanted to take all kinds of stuff with him, baseball bat, raquetball stuff,<br/>\nscooter, his own blanket and pillow, etc..  I pointed out about space<br/>\nconsiderations and said he would need to leave stuff behind.  He argued and<br/>\nargued, huffed around, I got mad.  Finally, I caught myself and pointing out<br/>\nthe problem, asked him how he would solve it.  He suggested using the<br/>\nsuitcase as a limit....after he had packed his clothes, he could fill the<br/>\nremaining room with his choice of stuff but could only take what could fit<br/>\nin the suitcase.<br/>\n<br/>\nMade perfect sense to me and worked like a charm.  He was happy...I was<br/>\nhappy...hopefully, nobody was too crowded on the ride to Granny&#39;s house.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38002,"nextTopicId":38016}}
