So for those who are interested, read <br/>\non. Otherwise, I&#39;ll just post, copy and save to my personal folder. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am cleaning out old school-ish stuff this weekend. I&#39;m tossing workbooks, math books, <br/>\nhandwriting books - you name it. I found an old school schedule book where I have every <br/>\nsubject planned for a week with little stickers to show the kids had done their work. At the <br/>\nend of each week, I wrote a personal note to the child praising his/her success and then <br/>\nmentioning what we&#39;d work on the next week (very affirming stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt touched me that I was trying so hard to be positive, upbeat and conscientious.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the funny things to notice was that that method only lasted about ten weeks. I lost <br/>\nsteam :) and I know why. My oldest just didn&#39;t like the whole planned sticker gig. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had a sort of epiphany. We often talk about deschooling for our kids taking as many <br/>\nyears as they were &quot;schooled&quot; (whether at home or in an actual school). But I wonder if <br/>\nwe&#39;ve ever looked at how long it takes to shed our *own* school experiences - the <br/>\nindoctrination of years of people telling us how to learn, that we need to do what we don&#39;t <br/>\nlike to do to get ahead, that experts know more than we do, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat at a table with university professors two weeks ago. (My husband teaches at two <br/>\ndifferent universities in town and this was a banquet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe table of profs found out that we homeschool and began asking questions. One said, <br/>\n&quot;Yes, it all  sounds good. But how do you get them to do what they don&#39;t want to do? After <br/>\nall, everyone has to learn subjects they don&#39;t like to get ahead. How do you make them <br/>\nlearn math, for instance, if they don&#39;t like it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband looked at me sideways and grinned his &quot;How will you get out of this one?&quot; <br/>\nsmile.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t,&quot; I said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe table stopped talking.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t believe in making a child learn - because it&#39;s not possible to learn the subject <br/>\nunder those conditions. Learning itself is contagious and all subjects have intrinsic value <br/>\nand intrigue. But if a child hasn&#39;t discovered that about a particular subject, force just <br/>\nteaches other lessons that I don&#39;t want them to learn - such as, I can store information in <br/>\nmy short term memory for a test and then forget it, or math is awful, or important <br/>\nsubjects are hard and boring, or other people know better than me what is important for <br/>\nme to know/learn.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I shared about a success with my daughter in math, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the end of the conversation, they had shifted positions and were discussiing how true it <br/>\nis that you can&#39;t make anyone learn or love learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so tired of everyone focusing always on &quot;learning to do what we don&#39;t want to do&quot; as <br/>\nthe highest virtue in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, my son (17) is so light (after deciding to come home full time again). He suddenly <br/>\nis in charge of his life. He said, &quot;I want to watch that one movie list I have in order and <br/>\nthen read the screenplays.
