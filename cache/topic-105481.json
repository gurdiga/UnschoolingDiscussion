Nike was <br/>\naware of her gown&#39;s shortcomings as she had explored the offerings <br/>\nat SCA.org and other period-friendly sites many moons ago.  As I <br/>\nmentioned to my correspondent, she had also subscribed to the local <br/>\nSCA mailing list last year, but the group appeared to be very <br/>\ninactive and she felt awkward about showing up unannounced at the <br/>\nmeetings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNike has long been interested in authentic costuming (hence, our <br/>\nsewing projects of limited success as previously mentioned) and <br/>\nliving history, but hasn&#39;t had much success finding career options <br/>\nin the field.  She heads off to a realist workshop in Toronto this <br/>\nsummer to help her decide whether art school will be in her future.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has contacts or is experienced in any of the following: <br/>\nSCA, fashion design/costuming, artists in the realist style, nature <br/>\nand wildlife photography and related work, etc. -- in the central <br/>\nFlorida area (we live along the Gulf/Nature Coastline) or otherwise -<br/>\n- we&#39;d be thrilled to hear about it.
