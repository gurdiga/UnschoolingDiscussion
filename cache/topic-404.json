I find it sad and somewhat disturbing to hear<br/>\nunschoolers blithely declaring how useless algebra is. I&#39;m convinced that<br/>\nany subject can be fascinating if approached at the right time and in the<br/>\nright way--higher math included--and I hope to model that excitement and<br/>\ndelight in learning for my kids. To me, that&#39;s the key to home<br/>\neducation--modeling learning as enjoyable and wonder-filled--and I think it<br/>\napplies to math as well as to reading or writing or ancient history or<br/>\nbotany or Morse code or Super Mario Brothers...<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura Bush<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura@...\">laura@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.honeypot-hollow.com\">http://www.honeypot-hollow.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Carol E.

I think of math<br/>\nas a unity, not in individual chunks like &quot;algebra&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;geometry&quot;, so I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s specifically algebra, but I<br/>\nuse patterns in my knitting and crocheting,  look at how things<br/>\nchange in relationship to each other (like trying to adapt my<br/>\nbread recipes for Florida&#39;s summer heat and humidity.  If I<br/>\nincrease the yeast, what happens to rising time, ultimate size of<br/>\nloaves, etc.?)  I&#39;m loving the fact that my second child is<br/>\nfinally looking at algebra (ask me if you want some great non<br/>\ntextbook approaches to it) and inviting me along in the journey.<br/>\nNumber one child did it alone and I missed out!  I hope you&#39;re<br/>\nnot limiting your chance for delight because your schooling made<br/>\nyou hate math.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":413,"nextTopicId":96}}
