This is not meant<br/>\nto offend but some of the facts put out by the medical profession leave a<br/>\nlittle bit to be desired.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s take adults that get measles, chicken pox and mumps.  What they<br/>\nneglect to say is that currently the vast majority of folks getting these<br/>\n&quot;childhood&quot; diseases that are having such problems with the diseases are the<br/>\nvery people who were immunized as children.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, there was an outbreak of whooping cough in the Bay Area a<br/>\ncouple of years ago.  This went through schools like the plague.  Guess<br/>\nwhat, these kids had all had their shots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number of deaths and adverse reactions from vaccines far out weigh the<br/>\nnumbers that use to have severe reactions or die from the diseases<br/>\nthemselves.  Also, it needs to be noted that knowledge is the real reason<br/>\nthat there have been reductions in most of these diseases--knowledge of<br/>\nproper personal hygiene, knowledge of proper municipal hygiene (water,<br/>\nsewage), knowledge of the cause, knowledge in proper care of the patient<br/>\nonce they contract a disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, take Hep B.  More kids are dying of the vaccine than died of the<br/>\ndisease, plus deaths from the traditional causes of the disease continue<br/>\nalbeit at a reduced rate *due to* knowledge--knowledge of blood screening,<br/>\nknowledge of pretesting before a woman gets pregnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as others have stated, do your research, but DON&#39;T just rely on what the<br/>\nmedical profession is telling you by way of the handouts which the<br/>\npharmaceutical companies give them.  After all, to not vaccinate causes a<br/>\nbig drop in the profits of those multimillionaire drug CEOs.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, retired Nursing Services Coordinator<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:androdite@...\">androdite@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Adults who are not immunized nor experience those childhood diseases tend<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; suffer those diseases far worse than the children recieving the<br/>\nimmunizations<br/>\n&gt; or even contracting the diseases...also...I am a nurse...I have to show an<br/>\n&gt; immunity to measles before I can work in any facility...because...if I<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt; contract the disease it is possible for me to pass it on to either<br/>\npregnant<br/>\n&gt; patients or pregnant co-workers and measles (I believe the rubella<br/>\nversion)<br/>\n&gt; is devastating to the unborn.
