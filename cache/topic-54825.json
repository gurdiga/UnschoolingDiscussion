Computerize it as much <br/>\nas possible so it&#39;s always as right as it can be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI only write checks for bills that come in the mail.  I use my debit card <br/>\neverywhere else.  I download my transactions every day, so I know if <br/>\nsomething might bounce before the bank knows.  Every day when I get the mail, <br/>\nI throw out all the junk and then sit right down at the computer and write <br/>\nthe checks and put them in the envelope.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter if I don&#39;t have the money at that point, because my banking <br/>\nprogram (Quicken) will line it up just right anyway.  Then I enter the checks <br/>\nin the computer, stuff the envelope and write the date the bill is due on the <br/>\nenvelope where the stamp would go.  Then I put all the bills in a SACRED <br/>\nplace on my desk.  &lt;g&gt; (My desk is always piled up with mine and everyone <br/>\nelse&#39;s SHTUFF, except for this one little envelope sized area that is SACRED <br/>\nI tell ya!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo every day when I download the last night&#39;s transactions, I pick up the <br/>\nenvelopes and see if any need to be mailed that day.  I put stamps on those.  <br/>\nA stamp in my mind is like a red flag!  If it has a stamp, it MUST go in the <br/>\nmailbox that day, or disaster might occur.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be just like you.  I would avoid the task until it became <br/>\noverwhelming.  But doing a little every day makes it manageable, and it also <br/>\ngives me the security of knowing exactly what our money situation is at every <br/>\nmoment.  That makes me feel really HAPPY and secure.  I can get really <br/>\ndepressed over the bills if I feel out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest you start over completely.  Look for a couple of days when it will <br/>\nbe likely that you can go without using the bank account at all (this helps <br/>\nyou not have to deal with straggling transactions that might bite you).  Then <br/>\nset up Quicken (or Money or whathaveyou) with an opening balance of what the <br/>\nbank shows.  Then, spend 2 months doing what I described (adapting it to your <br/>\nsituation, of course).  At the end of two statement cycles, if you&#39;ve <br/>\nbalanced every day online through your bank, it will be apparent what the $$ <br/>\ndifference is between your old checkbook and the bank.  Not that it will <br/>\nmatter, because you will be all balanced up!  But I&#39;m the curious sort and <br/>\nwould want to know what the difference is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s harder to get started when every dime is critical, because the cash flow <br/>\nreally needs to be halted for a while so you can be absolutely sure.  It <br/>\ncosts a little money to have online access.  I pay about $15 a month ($5.95 <br/>\nplus .50 for every dl over 10 in a month) to download every day, and they <br/>\nwave the normal service charge because we have direct deposit of dh&#39;s <br/>\npaychecks.  But I could just go view them online and it would be much <br/>\ncheaper.  So, I understand if this seems impossible for some.  But my peace <br/>\nof mind is so worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@bravewriter.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Things we HAVE to do...","postDate":"1042555560","msgId":54887,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwMTdyOCtlMGRrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGIwMTZxaitwMmc1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54884,"nextInTopic":54898,"prevInTime":54886,"nextInTime":54888,"topicId":54825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... this ... from the ...

He <br/>\nknew right from wrong; the man&#39;s parents were flabbergasted, the <br/>\nchurch was hurting from all of this, and he continued in his stubborn <br/>\nrefusal to do the right thing. (By the Bible, marrying the woman you <br/>\nbed IS the right thing.) I think a brother of his committed suicide, <br/>\ntoo. There was probably some weird garbage going on in that family, <br/>\nright? (Oh, he did end up marrying her, and has turned out to be a <br/>\nfantastic husband and father)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, close friends of that family, with 9 kids I think, and <br/>\nhomeschooling with a similar method, and with a BEAUTIFUL classical <br/>\nmusic ministry...one of their boys tried to strangle himself. I <br/>\nwondered then...is it a &quot;step on all signs of different thinking&quot; <br/>\nthat comes with strict, scheduled, structured childhoods? Other <br/>\nfamilies in this little group of Principle Approach-ers have missed <br/>\nthe mark terribly, with lies and deception amongst the adults, and <br/>\nsymptoms of stress in the children.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) THE UGLY ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT LOVELY INSIDE SCENARIO: Fast forward <br/>\nto one of my dearest friends, a woman with three boys, who didn&#39;t <br/>\nhomeschool, but whose childrearing philosophy is fitting in with what <br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading here very well. &quot;Let em be and love em.&quot; Her house <br/>\nwas ALWAYS trashed, her boys are confident and sure of themselves. <br/>\nInto gaming and SCA, like Sandra&#39;s boys. I don&#39;t think their group is <br/>\nactually SCA, though. They emphasize more the battling than the <br/>\nchivalry. Hagerdaaz? Daagerhaz? something like that. They&#39;re grown <br/>\nnow, and each of those boys works just as much as they need to, to <br/>\nfund their hobby. Still living at home, at 22 and 19, and the <br/>\nyoungest is 17 I think in his senior year. My friend divorced and <br/>\nmoved out, but the boys still live with their dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from having minimal work ethic, these guys are very cool kids. <br/>\nThey&#39;re funny and enjoy each other&#39;s company, and none of them has <br/>\never committed a crime, impregnated a girl (the oldest just now <br/>\nstarted dating), gotten into a *real* fight...etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what you had to say does make sense. Controlling them outwardly <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t always lead to upstanding citizens or healthy people; leaving <br/>\nthem to their own devices doesn&#39;t always create monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) THE WONDERFUL ALL AROUND SCENARIO: Now, to my best friend. She is <br/>\na strict mother, one who pushes her kids to achieve. She, herself, is <br/>\nan achiever, doing with excellence everything she sets out to do. Her <br/>\noldest daughter has won oratory awards, taken first place in every <br/>\n4-H competition she ever entered, now married and managing a Curves <br/>\nworkout center and moving up in Mary Kay. She is happy, along with <br/>\nbeing kind, gentle, capable of serving others, funny, self-confident, <br/>\npatient, etc. She and her mom are good friends with a loving, open <br/>\nrelationship. When my friend gets too opinionated about how her <br/>\ndaughter is doing things, the daughter doesn&#39;t hesitate to tell her <br/>\nto chill...ehem, now that the daughter is an adult with her own home <br/>\nand husband. It wouldn&#39;t have happened while she was under her mom&#39;s <br/>\nroof! My friend brooks no disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend&#39;s son is 18. He also has excelled, having both the marks of <br/>\nsuccess that &quot;the system&quot; has to offer (awards, leadership positions <br/>\nin the community, etc) and the marks of an upright human being. When <br/>\nI went to spend the afternoon with my friend, he came into the room <br/>\nand told me I looked great. This, an 18 year old kid, complimenting <br/>\nhis mom&#39;s friend. He also compliments his mom, having said to her in <br/>\npublic &quot;I&#39;d rather spend time with you, anyway&quot; when he couldn&#39;t get <br/>\nahold of a friend to hang with. I heard him say it, and so did half <br/>\nthe crowd at a church thingy. He has friends who make bad choices, <br/>\nand he doesn&#39;t go along with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the 11 year old. So far, not a lot of outward <br/>\nachievement award type activity, but what awards are available to a <br/>\nyounger child, she has earned. She also shines as a person, being a <br/>\ngood conversationalist, fun to be with, intelligent. Not long ago, <br/>\nwhile my friend and I chatted on the phone, the child got going on <br/>\ncleaning out the fridge...not because she was asked to. But she also <br/>\ndoes do the things her mom asks or tells her to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould the difference be, not the amount of controlling or the <br/>\nexpectations we place upon our children, but the relationships we <br/>\ndevelop with them? I don&#39;t know the families in the first (ugly) <br/>\nscenario I described, but I do know that the man who got his woman <br/>\npregnant and wouldn&#39;t marry her, has a lot of bitterness towards his <br/>\ndad. Did the families in scenario 1 apply controlling methods without <br/>\ndeveloping a warm, sincere bond with their kids? My friend with the <br/>\ntrashed house and the cool kids...not a whole lot of &quot;discipline&quot; or <br/>\npushing going on there, but she loves them, and they love her. She <br/>\npoured herself into them, since her husband didn&#39;t love her. And <br/>\ntheir overall &quot;coolness&quot; shows it. Same with my best friend&#39;s family. <br/>\nShe is 100% into them, just like she is 100% into anything she does. <br/>\nAnd they know it, and can grow well in the strong love she has for <br/>\nthem, even though she demands things of them and pushes them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy folks didn&#39;t push me, didn&#39;t place hardly any expectations on me, <br/>\nlet me choose for the most part...and I went completely nuts at age <br/>\n15, got into drugs and sex, dropped out of high school, and was angry <br/>\nand bitter at them for years. Why? I think it&#39;s because they never <br/>\nbothered to develop an open, trusting, loving relationship with me. I <br/>\nthink basically, underneath it, their love for me won out, because as <br/>\nan adult, I&#39;m confident and capable, and my mom and I get along fine <br/>\nnow. We enjoy each other. Same with my dad. And my sister and brother <br/>\nand I are all friends.

It&#39;s easier to &quot;accept&quot; slavery if you never <br/>\nknow any other life. And it can KEEP you in a state of servitude.

Now, my firm belief is, if they have these character <br/>\n&gt; qualities, they will be happy. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know Heidi, this is how I was taught to think. There is a <br/>\nstrange aversion to the idea of happiness in many Christian <br/>\ncircles. Happiness is often pitted against joy and joy is seen as <br/>\nsome kind of experience of living that is not happy, but willing to <br/>\nbe content in spite of negative circumstances. This has always <br/>\npuzzled me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently i realized that it is a method for keeping a person from <br/>\nevaluating whether or not his/her life is indeed happy. A person <br/>\ncan always say, &quot;Well, the goal wasn&#39;t to be happy, it was to be <br/>\njoyful in spite of horrible or hard or dull circumstances. So I&#39;ll just <br/>\nsay I&#39;m joyful.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what is the point of an emotion that you don&#39;t experience? <br/>\nAnd why is happiness something we wouldn&#39;t aim for?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s because deep down we fear the experience of pleasure. We <br/>\nwee pleasure as leading us into selfish, sinful behaviors. We <br/>\nthink that pleasure and selfishness go together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince willingness to serve others (for <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; instance) is one of the things I want to see in my children, they <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to practice serving in our family.

Because I have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trained <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Last night I shaed with my dh about the chores ideas explained <br/>\nhere on this list. We, too, have chores that the kids have learned <br/>\nto do as part of our family. Since there is no one rebelling <br/>\nagainst the idea and we are late comers to a total unschooling <br/>\nview, we&#39;ve decided not to rock that boat at this time. But we also <br/>\nrealized last night that there is a danger is assigning kids to <br/>\n&quot;serve&quot; each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey may learn how to fulfill their duties, but is that the same as <br/>\nservice? Yesterday my middle child saw me cleaning up the <br/>\nkitchen (I didn&#39;t ask for help, I was just doing it while they played <br/>\non the X box). He got off the game he was playing and said, &quot;Hey <br/>\nmom. You&#39;re doing all the work. I&#39;ve played all morning. Can I <br/>\nhelp you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, THAT is service! and I stood there stunned. We&#39;ve been at <br/>\nthis one week.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would say that, none of those qualities listed above will come <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; children naturally. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I staunchly disagree with this statement. Some of the most kind <br/>\nactions I&#39;ve ever seen have been offered by two year olds. I <br/>\nremember when my daughter was a newborn, my 2 yos got his <br/>\nfavorite toy truck (yes it was all metal) and dragged a chair to the <br/>\nmoses basket on the table. He dropped it into the basket with <br/>\nher as a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see: kind, capable of serving others, gentle (okay the truck <br/>\nWAS metal, but...), humble...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat usually happens with kids is that they are somewhat <br/>\nego-centered. What they really need is some loving guidance, <br/>\nnot the assumption that they are never going to be good until we <br/>\nteach and require it of them. So when my 2 yos puts a big metal <br/>\ntruck in a newborn&#39;s bed, I can see immediately the good heart <br/>\nbehind the action. Then I can show him what she&#39;d really like <br/>\nfrom himback pats, strokes on her furry head, and a kiss on <br/>\nthe cheek.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is now 15. I&#39;ve never required him to teach his younger <br/>\nsiblings or to play with them. Yet he chooses to do these things <br/>\nevery sinlge day. He teaches computer games to his brothers, <br/>\nputs the 6yog in his lap and reads to her, talks to his next sister <br/>\nin line late into the night after &quot;bedtime&quot; and plays chess with our <br/>\nother son. And he&#39;s generous to a fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not taught or required any of these behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;ve lived them in front of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I singled him out because he&#39;s the oldest... but I have examples <br/>\nfrom all four other kids too).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of them will come by way of natural <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; consequences, and they&#39;ll adjust their behavior in order to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>avoid the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; same mistake next time. Some of it...it&#39;s gonna come from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>myself and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; their father, period. (we being such paragons of moral <br/>\n </span></blockquote>uprightness! <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good point. We don&#39;t even live up to our own ideals. I think it&#39;s a <br/>\ncrime to expect that children will or can all the time. Better to let <br/>\nthem come to the point we&#39;re atdesiring to do good because <br/>\ngood is good to do, not because good is required of you.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; obedient, and giving them chores that they DON&#39;T WANT TO <br/>\n </span></blockquote>DO, my <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; children are happy. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not doubting that your kids are happy in their lives. Most <br/>\nloving homes have happy kids. And I don&#39;t think chores that are <br/>\nrequired equate disgruntled children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I now realize is that our kids are amazingly able to absorb <br/>\nother people&#39;s expectations for them. And over time those <br/>\naccumulate. So if we keep piling it on, keep taking advantage of <br/>\ntheir good will and short memories, there will be a price to pay at <br/>\nsome time. It may not be during chores, but it will show itself. <br/>\nMark it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Things we HAVE to do...","postDate":"1042548144","msgId":54867,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Yy4xNDdkNzg3MS4yYjU1NWZiMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54865,"nextInTopic":54868,"prevInTime":54866,"nextInTime":54868,"topicId":54825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/13/2003 11:07:31 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

Can you let go of the idea that *you have trained them* to do <br/>\nanything?  Can you see it more that they have chosen to behave in a certain <br/>\nway that made sense to them at the time (i.e., not behaving in the way that <br/>\nyou were attempting to &quot;train&quot; them to would have yielded unacceptable <br/>\nconsequences to them).  They could have just as easily gone the other way, <br/>\nas many children do, or they could have become passive-aggressive (let you <br/>\n*think* they&#39;re doing what you say but going against you behind your <br/>\nback).  I really think it&#39;s important for us to remember that we have the <br/>\nchoice to behave in the most reasonable way to us at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of their angry and violent reactions, my parents were very scary <br/>\nand threatening to me when I was little.  My best response to them at the <br/>\ntime was not to be honest with them; this was my way of protecting myself <br/>\nwhen I was a little girl, and it was a reasonable choice to make at the <br/>\ntime, and although I felt badly about it as a little girl, I understand it <br/>\nnow.  But, another kid might have toed the line under the same <br/>\ncircumstances; that would just have been their most reasonable reaction to <br/>\nthe set of circumstances.  My reaction was the most sensible to me at the <br/>\ntime.  I was afraid of my parents!  Now, my parents may have thought that <br/>\nthey were &quot;training me up&quot; to be some ideal of theirs; I&#39;m pretty sure that <br/>\nmy reaction was not their desired outcome.  We had a lot of nasty scenes <br/>\nwhen I was young because of my not being able to be trusted by them, but I <br/>\ncan see now that in my eyes, they were really the ones who could not be <br/>\ntrusted and I responded accordingly.  I was not able to articulate that at <br/>\nall or even understand it when I was little, and, of course, I bought into <br/>\ntheir version of the whole thing.  But, in retrospect I can see that my <br/>\nchoices were a reasonable response to the perceived threat they posed to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our relationships with our children require a lot more empathy and <br/>\nthought.  I really think we have to let go of the notion that we can push <br/>\nour children to perform in some way that WE chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really liked this T shirt I saw at a LLL conference when my son was very <br/>\nlittle.  It said, &quot;You have to be what you want your children to <br/>\nbecome.&quot;  But now, I think it is important to realize that our children <br/>\nwill make their own best choices that make the most sense to them.  Trying <br/>\nto push them in a particular direction may not yield the kinds of results <br/>\nwe anticipate or desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Things we HAVE to do...","postDate":"1042547467","msgId":54864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhLjM0YzU1NmZmLjJiNTU1ZDBiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":54863,"nextInTopic":54865,"prevInTime":54863,"nextInTime":54865,"topicId":54825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/13/2003 10:31:51 PM Eastern Standard Time, ... head?

Are you respectful to them?  Humble in their presence?  Is<br/>\nyour heart full of gratitude toward them?  Do you serve them, are you<br/>\ngiving, and patient with them and self controlled?   Have you<br/>\ndemonstrated a good work ethic? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m asking because I think if a parent is frustrated or agitated or anal<br/>\nabout keeping house and requires other to help, that&#39;s not the best<br/>\ndemonstration of work ethic, serving others, or respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Each one of them does what chores I <br/>\nassign...without complaining. Really, they do. Because I have trained <br/>\nthem to do so. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t doubt this, I&#39;m sure you have things running the way you like.  <br/>\nBut there are others here, myself included who have not assigned chores<br/>\nto children, and who have not *trained* them, and the children still<br/>\nhelp.    They help willingly, happily even.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would say that, none of those qualities listed above will come to <br/>\nchildren naturally.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hasn&#39;t been my experience.   My son has been very naturally<br/>\ndemonstrating all those things you mentioned for many years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Some of it...it&#39;s gonna come from myself and <br/>\ntheir father, period.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to tell myself that Dylan is the person he is because his father<br/>\nand I have modeled it for him.  Maybe he would be this way no matter who<br/>\nhis parents were, but I believe he is kind because we have been kind to<br/>\nhim.   I believe he&#39;s respectful because we show him respect.    I<br/>\nbelieve he&#39;s patient and humble and moral and giving and self controlled<br/>\nbecause we have tried to be all these things with him, to give him a good<br/>\nmodel.    But even more than that I think he has all these qualities<br/>\nbecause they are natural human qualities, present in every baby from the<br/>\nstart and only need love and nurturing to blossom.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is ten and he has several jobs.  He feeds and plays with the<br/>\nneighbors dog on the weekends when they are gone.  He lets her in and out<br/>\nof their house.  He&#39;s very responsible about it and he&#39;s done it now for<br/>\nover a year.    He feeds another neighbor&#39;s fish when they&#39;re not home,<br/>\nand they travel for their work so he&#39;s at their house at least every<br/>\nother week for several days.    Last year he was invited to the Green<br/>\nParty convention in our state... a personal invitation from the<br/>\ncoordinating chairman.   He was invited because he had collected<br/>\nsignatures for ballot initiatives in our area.   He really wanted to go,<br/>\nbut by the time he heard about it he had already committed himself to<br/>\nfeeding the fish.   There was no way to do both, because the fish needed<br/>\nto be fed twice a day and the convention was far enough away that we<br/>\nwould have to stay overnight  to attend the meetings.    His father<br/>\noffered to take over fish duty so he could go, but Dylan refused.   He<br/>\nsaid it was his responsibility and he wanted Gail to know she could count<br/>\non him.   He was nine years old.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have never required him to do chores, but he did dishes twice today<br/>\nbecause I wasn&#39;t feeling well, and just now when I was coughing he<br/>\nbrought me some peppermint tea.   I didn&#39;t ask him to do the dishes.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask him to bring me tea, he just did it because he knew it would<br/>\nhelp me.    He thanked me for taking him to his karate class.   So here<br/>\nare demonstrations of several of the things you mention in a child who<br/>\nhas never been required to do chores, who has never been required to do<br/>\n&quot;school work&quot;, who  has never been spanked or punished or threatened.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***And I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to be <br/>\nobedient, and giving them chores that they DON&#39;T WANT TO DO, my <br/>\nchildren are happy.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe you have happy children.

I <br/>\npray that they will, but more than happy, I&#39;d like to see them be <br/>\ngood. By that, I mean, morally upright, with something of a work <br/>\nethic, kind, gentle, respectful, humble, with hearts full of <br/>\ngratitude, capable of serving others, giving, patient, self-<br/>\ncontrolled. Now, my firm belief is, if they have these character <br/>\nqualities, they will be happy. Since willingness to serve others (for <br/>\ninstance) is one of the things I want to see in my children, they get <br/>\nto practice serving in our family. In order to keep the household <br/>\nrunning, they each have chores. Each one of them does what chores I <br/>\nassign...without complaining. Really, they do. Because I have trained <br/>\nthem to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that, none of those qualities listed above will come to <br/>\nchildren naturally. Some of them will come by way of natural <br/>\nconsequences, and they&#39;ll adjust their behavior in order to avoid the <br/>\nsame mistake next time. Some of it...it&#39;s gonna come from myself and <br/>\ntheir father, period. (we being such paragons of moral uprightness! <br/>\nLOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to be <br/>\nobedient, and giving them chores that they DON&#39;T WANT TO DO, my <br/>\nchildren are happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, Heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Things we HAVE to do...","postDate":"1042520579","msgId":54841,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3OS4xNDgwNjFiMC4yYjU0ZjQwM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54832,"nextInTopic":54850,"prevInTime":54840,"nextInTime":54842,"topicId":54825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/13/03 7:12:42 PM, bunsofaluminum60@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1340640821\">In a message dated 1/13/03 7:12:42 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Someone&#39;s website (sandra dodd?) has Calvin (of Calvin & <br/>\nHobbes)...well, it shows the poor kid sitting all bored at his school <br/>\ndesk, but there was no picture of him coming away from his comic book <br/>\nreading with a twitch, or his eyeballs spinning out of his head from <br/>\nwatching so much TV.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an animation about going into a fantasy world.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s on Marty&#39;s page (which is needing some work)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/marty\">http://sandradodd.com/marty</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand I didn&#39;t find any animations besides that one.<br/>\nBut comic books aren&#39;t school.<br/>\nAnd television isn&#39;t school.<br/>\nAnd using an anti-school animation which involves Calvin & Hobbes doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean I subscribe to a Calvin & Hobbe&#39;s religion.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\nOkay.

If you care that their rooms get cleaned but <br/>\nthey don&#39;t, then you should do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t make beds.  I think it&#39;s a waste of time.  For other people, <br/>\nit&#39;s really important.  If someone came to my house and asked me why <br/>\nmy beds weren&#39;t made, I&#39;d say because I don&#39;t care enough about <br/>\nhaving them made to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got the concept down.  I see the wisdom in it. I&#39;m really, <br/>\nreally trying to make it work.  But sometimes when the house looks <br/>\nlike it does right now, and I am facing a few hours of cleaning in <br/>\norder to shape it up, I get frustrated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDh doesn&#39;t necessarily agree with me either.  He kind of does, but a <br/>\nmessy house bothers him more than it bothers me.  Today he came home <br/>\nand said that if he has to clean the house when he gets home, don&#39;t <br/>\nexpect him to do anything else. He is in a grumpy mood because he has <br/>\na bachache and didn&#39;t sleep well last night, but it still made me <br/>\nfeel bad.  I felt guilty that I wasn&#39;t keeping up enough.  And I felt <br/>\noverwhelmed, because I want to help take care of his needs too, and <br/>\nhe obviously needs the house to be neater than it is.  But if I have <br/>\n3 kids messing up faster than I can clean up, and they need me to do <br/>\nthings with them instead of cleaning up, well...you&#39;re going to have <br/>\na messy house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids attempted to make a pinata and left the mess behind.  Dd made <br/>\nup her own cake recipe on her own, wrote down all the ingredients, <br/>\nstapled the two papers together, and made the cake.  She did no <br/>\ndishes and didn&#39;t clean up at all.  She dropped a bag of cornflour <br/>\nwhile she was getting stuff out of the cupboard.  The bag ripped and <br/>\nspilled on the floor and she just left it there.  Dd played with <br/>\nballoons, vinegar and baking soda on the diningroom floor. The three <br/>\nyear old has been into filling balloons with water (not full enough <br/>\nto break) and asking people to tie them for him.   There are balloons <br/>\nall over the floor in several rooms of the house.  No one cleaned up <br/>\ntheir messes on the kitchen table from any food they got themselves <br/>\nall day.  Someone got him or her self a drink, spilled it on the <br/>\ntable, and it never got cleaned up.  There are toys all over the <br/>\nplayroom floor and all over the bedrooms.  The sink is stacked with <br/>\ndishes.  Now I have to go work on cleaning for several hours instead <br/>\nof resting before bed, and that stresses me out.  I guess it is good <br/>\nthat they cleaned the livingroom up without being told because they <br/>\nwanted it to be their &quot;house&quot;.  But the rest of the house is going to <br/>\ntake some work--at least 3 or 4 hours.  And what will really get me <br/>\nstressed is if they say, &quot;Mommy, can&#39;t you play a game with <br/>\nme?&quot;  &quot;Mommy, help me with my computer game&quot;.  And I&#39;m trying to <br/>\nfinally get some semblence of order to the house. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was VERY frustrated today.  But then I thought about dd&#39;s <br/>\nexperiment today.  She put a balloon around the rim of the vinegar <br/>\nand dumped some vinegar in it.  Then she put baking soda in an old <br/>\nshampoo bottle and put the balloon around the rim of the shampoo <br/>\nbottle and it blew the balloon up.  She figured that out all on her <br/>\nown, with no experiment books or anyone putting any ideas in her <br/>\nhead.  And I thought that it was so cool that she lived in a house <br/>\nwhere she could make a mess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they DID clean the livingroom up, all on their own.  They put all <br/>\ntheir toys away, folded all the blankets, arranged the pillows on the <br/>\ncouch, AND put away all of the laundry I had started to fold.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the house is still a mess and I&#39;m still frustrated and tired and <br/>\nstressed.  I REALLy need to work on just getting more joy from <br/>\nserving my family.  It is not an easy thing for me to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\n I bought that new Hoover hard floor cleaner, and I&#39;m going to go try <br/>\nit out.

He has learned that sometimes you have to do<br/>\nsomething (deal with the frustration of losing) to get a reward (winning the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to also imagine that somewhere down the line there will be a time when Jason has<br/>\nto do or learn something that he does not want to do in order to get something he does<br/>\nwant. That is life, right? And when that time comes, because it is his choice, he will<br/>\ndo it and learn from it. My dad keeps talking about the self-discipline that is learned<br/>\nin school...is it really self-discipline if it is imposed by a teacher? I guess that if<br/>\nyou buy into the working for grades (like my dad and I both did) then yes, you can<br/>\ndevelop good discipline...but what if you don&#39;t care about doing well? I doubt that<br/>\nyou would learn about self-discipline. BUT if there is something that you care about<br/>\nand want to achieve, *that* is where you will learn self-discipline. So making Jason <br/>\ndo writing every day will not teach him self-discipline...it will teach him (if I am <br/>\nlucky) that he can make me happy by doing what I want him to do (or if I am not lucky)<br/>\nit will teach him to hate writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does this stuff make so much sense to me but has my dad shaking his head?<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Things we HAVE to do...","postDate":"1042512076","msgId":54827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFhLjE2ZmNlY2MyLjJiNTRkMmNjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":54825,"nextInTopic":54828,"prevInTime":54826,"nextInTime":54828,"topicId":54825,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/13/03 9:12:38 PM Eastern Standard Time, ... making the kids do things that aren t interesting to them.

They clean their room <br/>\nbecause they want to find something.  They don&#39;t enjoy it.  And they aren&#39;t <br/>\ndoing it because I am making them, they do it for a reason all their own.  My <br/>\nson reads the gaming book not because he totally enjoys it but because he <br/>\nneeds the information inside to go further with the game.
