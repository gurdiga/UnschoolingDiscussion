But I hear that there is some testing and such that I have to look<br/>\n&gt;into more, guess I just figured that it would be the same as here. I&#39;m now <br/>\n&gt;trying<br/>\n&gt;to stay out of panic mode as just the thought of having to answer to anyone<br/>\n&gt;is making ds and I look at other options.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good luck with that!<br/>\nIf you need an unschooler to &#39;umbrella&#39; you in her private school, let me <br/>\nknow.  I&#39;d just list you as &#39;faculty&#39; and your son as a student and ignore <br/>\nthe heck out of you afterwards.  There&#39;s an upside to having to declare <br/>\nyourself a private school in Cali.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(some nice stuff snipped)We have 10 acres and are just<br/>\n&gt;completing a small log cabin  from some of the trees on our property and <br/>\n&gt;have done<br/>\n&gt;it by ourselves also. We have not logged out though as we love as many trees<br/>\n&gt;as possible and have a beautiful view of the White Mountains. We would <br/>\n&gt;love to<br/>\n&gt;put a Yurt up there also, did you find it hard to do? Anyway, it looks<br/>\n&gt;beautiful, must have been a nice family thing to accomplish together!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was a little harder than I thought it would be, and much easier than I <br/>\nfeared.  It comes with a picture manual that&#39;s a life-saver.  You&#39;re right <br/>\nand it turned out to be a really great thing to do together with the <br/>\nfamily.  The kids were a little dubious at first, but game.  The kids got <br/>\npretty excited when it was actually up and ds refused to sleep anywhere <br/>\nelse that night!<br/>\n<br/>\nFastening the three trellis sections (walls) together was the hardest part <br/>\n- except for trying to get the roof insulation and roof covering on between <br/>\ngusts of wind.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re really looking at yurts, we liked Pacific Yurts and Nesting Bird <br/>\nYurts the best.  They sometimes even have overstock or have a place on <br/>\ntheir websites where people can list their used yurts.  We chose to go with <br/>\nNesting Bird because it seemed the best deal for what we wanted (and, <br/>\nfrankly, seemed the best choice all around.)  I&#39;ve heard Pacific yurts are <br/>\npretty nice tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to see a pic of your log cabin!  That&#39;s a lot of work!  Did you <br/>\nreally log and notch all the logs yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Self-reliance is the antidote to institutional stupidity.&quot; JTGatto, <br/>\nMonarch Notes guide to One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74508,"nextTopicId":74732}}
