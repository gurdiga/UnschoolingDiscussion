Our discussions over the<br/>\n  &gt; years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for them<br/>\n  &gt; even though they adjusted okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, already I have become faintly aware of this. Our 12yo who has wanted for<br/>\n  always to move to the country, started exhibiting strange behaviour, and it<br/>\n  emerged that although he loves living here, he was still going through a major<br/>\n  grieving for all that has been his life until now, and has been left behind. The<br/>\n  2 that weren&#39;t that keen on moving seem almost to be handling it better -<br/>\n  perhaps their low expectations enabled them to be pleasantly surprised!<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>\n  &gt; plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>\n  &gt; choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do feel bad about this - children have so little choice really, in so many<br/>\n  areas of their lives. Even when we, as individual families, allow our children<br/>\n  choice, they soon become aware that other families don&#39;t work like that, and<br/>\n  that their choice is only theirs by virtue of our choice to allow it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>\n  &gt; attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow children<br/>\n  &gt; so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>\n  &gt; draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah, and I&#39;ve never been to good at balancing - I always did choose the swing<br/>\n  rather than the seesaw at the playground &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Carol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6205,"nextTopicId":6219}}
