We adopted our oldest child in 1994, after going through the <br/>\npregnancy with the birth-mom.  We were not on a list or anything.  My husband <br/>\nis a police officer;  One winter night while on duty he was flagged down by <br/>\nthis young girl whose car was broken down.  Unable to restart her car, he got <br/>\npermission from his sgt. to drive her to her home .  On the way to her home <br/>\nshe explained that she was pregnant, and that she was planning on an <br/>\nabortion.  She asked him if he was married, and if so, if we had children.  <br/>\nHe told her that we didn&#39;t, and she asked him if we would consider adopting <br/>\nher baby, as she really didn&#39;t think she could really go through an abortion <br/>\n(Thank God).  So, from that point, we went to all the prenatal appts., etc... <br/>\nand we were in the delivery room on the big day!                                <br/>\n                                        Seventeen mos later, I became <br/>\npregnant, and I was 31 years old, and married for over 10 yrs.  I firmly <br/>\nbelieve God had a plan, and that I was not to become pregnant until my <br/>\nadopted son came into my life first.  I still tear up as I relive all the <br/>\nmemories of how all this came to be.  It is such a blessing to become <br/>\nparents, however it happens.  Well, anyway, I got to experience nursing with <br/>\nmy 2nd child, and he ended up nursing for about 2 yrs.  A month after he was <br/>\ncompletely weaned, I got pregnant again!  Now I have my daughter, who is 6 <br/>\n1/2 mos old.  I cannot express the gratitude I feel for being blessed so, and <br/>\nwho would have guessed this was to be for me-- the one who seemingly could <br/>\nnot become pregnant.  Please know that there is a plan for you ,too, and <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m not trying to preach , I would like to say that place your faith in <br/>\nGod, and trust Him to take care of your needs.  He knows and loves you very <br/>\nmuch!

Though I know of<br/>\n several mild conditions that go undiagnosed and can affect fertility, I<br/>\n thought I&#39;d share a quick and easy experiment with you.  It took us 3<br/>\n years of solidly trying and being devoted to the calendar and cycles<br/>\n etc. for me to get pregnant.  A tip that a specialist offered me, as it<br/>\n had just appeared in a study documented in the Journal of Medicine, was<br/>\n taking a daily low-dose of Aspirin.  Heck, it can&#39;t really hurt to try,<br/>\n can it?  Apparently, there are many women who actually are conceiving<br/>\n but the uterine wall is hostile to implantation.  Either too thin or too<br/>\n thick for the newly-developing fetus to nestle in.  Aspirin, with its<br/>\n recognized blood-thinning abilities, can apparently solve a lot of those<br/>\n problems.  Meanwhile, many women don&#39;t even know they&#39;re pregnant<br/>\n because we miscarry so early we just assume it&#39;s a usual period.  As<br/>\n well, aspirin can also help keep the fallopian tubes free-flowing for<br/>\n the same reason.  There can be irregularities or inconsistencies that<br/>\n impede the process of ovulation.  Since I&#39;ve learned a bit about this<br/>\n and shared my info with others, 2 acquaintances have become pregnant. <br/>\n (I like to think this idea helped.) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia, we had a very similar situation.  I had 4  miscarriages between my 2 <br/>\nolder daughters.  They found some ANA irregularities as well as a hormonal <br/>\nimbalance.  I was on baby aspirin, progesterone and Clomid when I got <br/>\npregnant with my almost 7 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, out of the blue, we had a surprise baby at age 43!  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarcie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7542,"nextTopicId":7586}}
