I know my boys take charge of their own menus at <br/>\nrestaurants.  The server always looks at me and I say whatever they want.  <br/>\nThey order, and ask for refills.  I love to see that.  When I was young I had <br/>\nto ask my parents permission for everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at a sledding party this winter and after they had finished sledding, <br/>\nthe hostess offered the children some hot chocolate.  Dallen asked for <br/>\nanother cup and she said maybe he should ask his Mom first, he said <br/>\nno..she&#39;ll say OK.  And I would have.  I overheard all this from the living <br/>\nroom.  <br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62751,"nextTopicId":62547}}
