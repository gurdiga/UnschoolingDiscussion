There were billboards and programs  in schools <br/>\nbut it didn&#39;t offend me in the slightest, because some kids really  don&#39;t <br/>\neven learn the terminology for different aspects of integrity at home, and  so <br/>\neven if it&#39;s just a vocabulary project I think it has merit the way they do  it <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too think it has merit. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think the aspects of charcter that they may be teaching are necessarily religous in nature. I am sure there are similarities - but I would consider character as having intergrity, not murdering, stealing, raping, being honest, hardworking,kind, willing to assist your fellow man, etc, (I am sure there are lots more) as being basic principles of being a decent human being. I think most religions teach some sort of this - but I am also sure that not everyone practices them....<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103627,"nextTopicId":103651}}
