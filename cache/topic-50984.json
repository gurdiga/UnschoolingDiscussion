Our kids have a lot of access to Game Boy and Nintendo, but we do not <br/>\nhave TV at all.  When we first moved to Georgia, we had TV, cable and all.  <br/>\nWe found that there was so much garbage on cable that it wasn&#39;t worth <br/>\nkeeping, so we got rid of it.  Then about a month later our antennae broke, <br/>\nand we ended up with no channels.  No one seemed to miss it, so we just never <br/>\nreplaced the antennae.  We have a VCR and a DVD player and the kids can watch <br/>\nmovies whenever they want.  We have a real issue with all the negative and <br/>\nblatantly sexually explicit media images out there - it&#39;s scary that they <br/>\neven use sex to sell children&#39;s products (I saw a very suggestive commercial <br/>\nfor &quot;Fruit by the Foot&quot;).  We feel that those subtle innuendoes are <br/>\nunnecessary and damaging.  At our friends&#39; houses, the kids can take TV or <br/>\nleave it.  They aren&#39;t really &quot;into&quot; the latest trends, bands, fashions, <br/>\netc., and we like it that way!  Pokemon was the big thing when our TV died, <br/>\nso they sort of stalled there :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I guess I just wanted to say that removing TV is not always a bad <br/>\nthing.  I do agree that by restricting or denying access to something you are <br/>\ninviting an obsession, but it just doesn&#39;t seem to have happened in our case. <br/>\n Maybe it&#39;s because the stuff they enjoyed watching on TV (nature <br/>\ndocumentaries, for the most part, and Pokemon) are all available on video, so <br/>\nthey don&#39;t feel like they are missing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteph<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88706570,"authorName":"lwillson7@aol.com","from":"lwillson7@...","profile":"clccw4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Jumping in with both feet","postDate":"1039396308","msgId":51036,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1LjI2NDRjOTRjLjJiMjU0N2Q0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":51002,"nextInTopic":51047,"prevInTime":51035,"nextInTime":51037,"topicId":50984,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/8/2002 7:11:28 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...

Of course my son (8) <br/>\nalways wanted to be an unschooler but of course the grown-up thinks you have <br/>\nto do workbooks and have some sort of schedule for it to work. I trying to <br/>\nreally change my way of thinking. The school at home approach was not working <br/>\nat all and everyone was becoming very stressed. Last week it all can to a <br/>\nhead and we just said this isn&#39;t working lets go this way and see where life <br/>\nleads us. I know my son needs time to deschool (sorta speak) but since we <br/>\nshifted all he wants to do is play video games. I&#39;m really having to bite my <br/>\ntongue and just let it ride and see want happens. I don&#39;t want to take games <br/>\nand TV away just to get him to try something else.  Will this stage pass? I&#39;m <br/>\ntruly hoping so. My husband is not totally on board but letting us try it. <br/>\nI&#39;m hoping things with the games will change, in the mean time I intend to do <br/>\na lot of reading on-line and off for support to keep me from trying to push <br/>\nhim in any direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nLori<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51060,"nextTopicId":51167}}
