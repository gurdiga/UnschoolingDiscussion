I think we&#39;ve already discussed my embarrassing <br/>\nobsession with Neil Gaiman.<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh has always been homeschooled.<br/>\n I always ment to unschool, just not brave enough or maybe too lazy.<br/>\n We&#39;ve been relaxed, eclectic. even school at homeish, but never really <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\nFor the last two years we have actually been &quot;public&quot; school attendees <br/>\nsince we were involved in one of those virtual school using K12. Lots of <br/>\nreasons but mostly it made dh happy and Josh was receiving services <br/>\n(reading help) at our local school. Last year the special ed class (and <br/>\nhe did go from not being able to read to being able to struggle through <br/>\nCaptain Underpants) was something he enjoyed, for the most part, to <br/>\nattend. This year as he said &quot;it sucks&quot;. So he stopped.<br/>\nI wanted to stop K12. Ugh.<br/>\nBut, and this is silly, we had that extra computer now that you got with <br/>\nenrollment and, well, I don&#39;t share well so we couldn&#39;t quit until we <br/>\nscrapped up the cash to get ds his own computer. Lucky for us a friend&#39;s <br/>\nhubby is a &quot;computer guy&quot; had a really nice (nicer then mine) machine he <br/>\nwanted to get out of the house (he bought it for work, used it as a <br/>\nserver, but has a different setup now) and sold it cheap along with a 20 <br/>\ninch monitor. Josh will be stoked when he comes back from Kentucky <br/>\ntonight and sees this huge ass monitor. His BattleField 1942 plays on <br/>\nit. All will be well with the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I told ds that we were quitting the virtual school his 1st question <br/>\nwas:<br/>\n&quot;Can I unschool now?&quot;<br/>\nWell thats pretty direct and honest.<br/>\n So of course I said yes.<br/>\nAnd of course I will drive myself crazy worrying about math and reading. <br/>\nNow with reading we can get into the whole question if the &quot;schooling&quot; <br/>\ncauses the learning disability or if the ld is organic and he will <br/>\nalways have a problem with reading. My dh can read but only does for <br/>\ninformation. It does not come easy to him so he does not read for <br/>\npleasure. You have to understand that I&#39;m always the one telling <br/>\neveryone else to lighten up with their kids, to give let them choose <br/>\nwhat to to...but really it in a more eclectic homeschooling vein. Not <br/>\nwhat I perceive as pure unschooling. It never has seemed to hard me to <br/>\ngive a kid the lead when they are reading well, but I do struggle with <br/>\nthe whole &quot;late, late reader&quot; issue when mine is one of them. It was <br/>\neasy when he was 8, 9, even 10. It has gotten a lot harder at 12 (almost <br/>\n13).<br/>\nBut the truth is he&#39;s never wanted to read, has never cared, and I <br/>\nwonder if I&#39;ve done damage that can never be undone by pushing it for <br/>\nsooooo long and trying so many different reading programs and therapies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t worry that he&#39;ll play video games all day or watch tv. He <br/>\nalready has that freedom and moves form thing to thing in a day and if <br/>\nhe&#39;s playing Fable he is at least trying to read stuff. If he&#39;s online <br/>\nhe is figuring out how to work his way around and following along as his <br/>\nscreen reader reads websites to him. Josh has a program that will spell <br/>\nand do word prediction for him if wants to write. He really likes that <br/>\ntalking Franklin spelling/dictionary thingee. We are stocked up on the <br/>\nassitive technologies around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long to &quot;deschool&quot;?<br/>\nWell we&#39;ve been &quot;homeschooling&quot; since he was 4 so that&#39;s almost a whole <br/>\nyear&#39;s worth of time to get rid of the old and embrace the new.<br/>\nI just hope MY resolve can last that long.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie W<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Atari","postDate":"1097085082","msgId":100384,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MS4zNWI3YTEzYi4yZTk1OGE5YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100379,"nextInTopic":100399,"prevInTime":100383,"nextInTime":100385,"topicId":100379,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/6/2004 11:20:57 AM Central Standard Time, ohman@citlink.net writes: ...so  far it hasn t made us want to part with $20 that could go","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1159331892\">In a message dated 10/6/2004 11:20:57 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ohman@...\">ohman@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n...so  far it<br/>\nhasn&#39;t made us want to part with $20 that could go towards a game my  kids<br/>\nKNOW they would love.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~<br/>\n <br/>\nYeah, but I already know that I love Break Out.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen again, I did buy Tretris for PS2 before my trip and I have hardly  <br/>\nplayed it....so maybe I&#39;ll just skip Break Out, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4261131,"authorName":"Anne O","from":"&quot;Anne O&quot; &lt;ohman@...&gt;","profile":"anneounschooler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Atari","postDate":"1097079267","msgId":100379,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWM0YWJiZiQ4ZmRhMDVmMCQxYmQ1ZDdhYUBkaWdhdGl6ZXI+","referencesHeader":"PDEwOTcwNzYzMjYuMTA1NS41MjAyOC5tMTFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":100384,"prevInTime":100378,"nextInTime":100380,"topicId":100379,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** Speaking of that....Atari...have you seen those systems with the old games ... the ...
