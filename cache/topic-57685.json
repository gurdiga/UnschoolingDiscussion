Children are property and of course they have <br/>\nnothing intelligent to say they haven&#39;t been &quot;taught that in school yet.&quot;  <br/>\nBut I still have relationships with them.  We live very far apart so I see <br/>\nthem only on vacations.  We take regular vacations together every year or so. <br/>\n I maintain the relationship by not being physically close with them.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t share my parenting philosophies unless they ask.  I know people are <br/>\nvery sensitive about that and vacations are a time to be happy.  And I ALWAYS <br/>\nmake sure that we stay at separate hotels.  Without telling them of course.  <br/>\nBut that allows my family time to be away from them.  We also take vacations <br/>\nto theme parks, etc., so there isn&#39;t a time where they would have to think <br/>\nabout &quot;disciplining&quot; my children.  Have separate vehicles.  Etc.  That is how <br/>\nI maintain my relationship.  <br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57613,"nextTopicId":57689}}
