( And a Stop <br/>\nsign for his bedroom door!)  He loves them.  There&#39;s a really cool one that&#39;s <br/>\nbig and clear with another little one inside it, he was practicing his <br/>\nmultiplication with it, having fun, seeing if he could get bigger and bigger numbers <br/>\nwithout getting a low one, and other games he made up.    We also love <br/>\nYahtzee, altho after four games in a row,  I&#39;m out.  lol But his adding, and mine, <br/>\nare getting much faster, because he wants to roll again. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to go back and get more dice with more facets on them.  But, so far, <br/>\nhe&#39;s just raided his Dad&#39;s D&D dice bag. lol  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82328,"nextTopicId":82350}}
