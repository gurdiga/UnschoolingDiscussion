However, it had to go through the courts before we were allowed to keep him home.  I had to write a letter stating what we wanted to do, and how his educational needs would be accomplished.  I held my breath a bit because &quot;school&quot; in this house would be unconventional, to say the least.  However, I must have had a judge who thought outside the box because our wishes were granted and we were able to keep our son home and unschool him.  I think these decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, and it might have helped us that we already had an older son who had been &quot;schooled&quot; at home since the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Carol  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

As someone else said, private adoption is expensive; adoption through foster doesn&#39;t cost so much in money, but there is other &#39;stuff&#39; you have to deal with.  After you&#39;ve done a little searching, & reading about laws, which vary from state to state, you can begin to find adoption groups, and seek out folks who&#39;ve been through adoption.  Listen to everyone elses story, then tell them yours.  You will get an idea about what it&#39;s like to go through it, a general idea of cost, emotional and otherwise.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n <br/>\nSherry<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a Nice Day! &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI have lately been thinking that I&#39;d really like to adopt a child or two.<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
