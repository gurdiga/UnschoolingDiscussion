I have a son who has ALWAYS done this...and it extends to other issues than sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n    My youngest daughter also does it but not as much and she has NEVER had a bedtime.  She is almost 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Not a few days of allowing a child to choose when they sleep, but long term?<br/>\n    Perhaps a year of seeing what would really happen?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Does 5 or 6 years count?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n  Actually I should clarify this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now that my son is 14, its not as much of an issue.  He goes to bed late and sleeps late.  I don&#39;t plan much of anything in the mornings anymore unless I have to (like an appointment or something).<br/>\n<br/>\n  And last summer when he had swim practice in the mornings, his sleep rythms eventually did adjust.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But when he was LITTLE, like under the age of 6, he would stay up late and then get up early and be a monster.  He never adjusted.  He just went without sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I encouraged a bedtime (but didn&#39;t really enforce one) My husband didn&#39;t do anything about bedtimes and I worked evening shift.  So I gave up on bedtime &quot;schedules&quot; a LONG LONG time ago :o).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  But even with no bedtime for a couple of years, at that young age, he would still do this, even when he had to be up early in the morning.  He continued to do it for probably 6 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He would get more and more wound up and fussy when he is tired, he didn&#39;t &quot;settle down&quot; like a lot of kids do.  He didin&#39;t know how to settle himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Over the years, like at about age 9 and 10, he found ways to settle himself, by playing music while falling asleep or reading.   But he STILL did not fall asleep until midnight or 1am, even when he had to be up early. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m just glad its not an issue anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

The truth is that I don&#39;t know all <br/>\n  the kids in the world, but has been my experience that when &#39;bedtime rules&#39; <br/>\n  is not an issue, there&#39;s no reason to ignore the sensations that cause a <br/>\n  kid to want to go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In our house, there have never been any rules about when to go to bed.  My <br/>\n  now-8-year-old son really wants to go to bed when he gets sleepy, and he is <br/>\n  the one who makes that decision, nobody else.  Of course, if something is <br/>\n  going on that makes it more interesting to stay awake despite being tired, <br/>\n  then he will try to stay awake (I would, too), but that is a rare <br/>\n  occurrence, not the norm; when that guy gets tired, he craves going to <br/>\n  bed.  He sleeps as long as he needs to or wants to, and I am assured that <br/>\n  he is in tune with his own sleep needs because I have never interfered with <br/>\n  them.  If we are out somewhere, bed can be my arms or someone&#39;s sofa, and <br/>\n  he can drift off just as easily there (even now at the age of 8) or on the <br/>\n  car ride home.  He can also stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning or beyond <br/>\n  if there&#39;s something fun going on.  But, even if there&#39;s something fun <br/>\n  going on, when he gets really tired, there&#39;s no keeping him awake, and he <br/>\n  has no reason to resist.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes I piss him off because I can&#39;t stay awake to read to him as long <br/>\n  as he can stay awake to be read to, but he is extremely sympathetic and <br/>\n  will &quot;allow&quot; me to shut the light off when I just can&#39;t stay awake any <br/>\n  longer.  Anyway, he&#39;s usually content to drift off to sleep by that time, <br/>\n  too, but he knows that he is welcome to stay awake and play or look at a <br/>\n  book or do whatever he&#39;d like to do at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My guess is that when long-standing bedtime rules get lifted, the situation <br/>\n  you describe above may happen.  But, eventually, once a kid realizes that <br/>\n  the bedtime rules are really gone, staying awake after everyone else goes <br/>\n  off to bed probably wouldn&#39;t be as exciting anymore and then a kid can <br/>\n  start to respond more to their body clock that tells them when to go to bed <br/>\n  and when to get up.  In fact, a kid&#39;s need for going to bed may shift to <br/>\n  more of a night owl schedule, but if there&#39;s no need for early rising  in <br/>\n  the morning, what difference does it make?  I like what Sandra has said <br/>\n  about Kirby and his ability to manage his own bedtime schedule based on <br/>\n  what&#39;s important to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As I said, I don&#39;t know everyone in the world; this is only my <br/>\n  experience.  But, I do have the distant memory of resisting being sleepy if <br/>\n  I had the chance to stay awake late, because bedtimes were strictly <br/>\n  enforced when I was a wee one and I HATED it!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marji <br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

He sleeps as long as he needs to or wants to, and I am assured that <br/>\n&gt; he is in tune with his own sleep needs because I have never interfered with <br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> It&#39;s true that most kids will eventually fall to sleep on their own.  When <br/>\nmy daughter and son stayed up late, we had a great time.  It wasn&#39;t until <br/>\nafter they fell asleep and kept waking up, and waking up so early the next <br/>\nday that it wasn&#39;t good for them.  It&#39;s true that maybe them being on a <br/>\nschedule made it more difficult for them to handle not being on a schedule, <br/>\nbut most kids I know do well if they&#39;re on a schedule.  Going to sleep at <br/>\n9:00pm one night, and then 12:00am one night, 9:00am again, and then 1:30am <br/>\nthe next night isn&#39;t easy on most kids.  They can do it, but they probably <br/>\ndon&#39;t function well.  I have made the decision that they&#39;re too young to make <br/>\nthe decision and understand that when they don&#39;t get enough sleep the night <br/>\nbefore, it affects how they feel the next day.  Sometimes we stay up a little <br/>\nafter their normal bedtime and this doesn&#39;t seem to affect them, like 20 or <br/>\n30 minutes.  The bedtime schedule seems to work well for them and the whole <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@bravewriter.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: bedtime schedules","postDate":"1043339428","msgId":55889,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwcDViNCtmaDJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFhNS5mNDc5NGJjLjJiNjE2ODU1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":55886,"nextInTopic":55892,"prevInTime":55888,"nextInTime":55890,"topicId":55844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... starsuncloud@c... wrote: Ding, ding, ding!

He had never had to rise to meet a bus, never had <br/>\nused an alarm or anything like that. He loves to stay up really late <br/>\nat night and sleep in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of us wondered how he&#39;d fare in the transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo initially I got up and made sure he was up too. I would knock <br/>\non his door and help him wake up. I made his breakfast, we <br/>\ndouble checked together on his book bag and homework and he <br/>\nwent out the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a couple weeks of this, he started getting up to his alarm <br/>\nclcok. I would still get up a few minutes later to be sure he hadn&#39;t <br/>\nturned it off an gone back to sleep. He did actually a couple of <br/>\ntimes. But after a week or so of being up before I got in there, he <br/>\nstarted getting up without any check ups from me. I still wake up <br/>\n(I can&#39;t seem to sleep knowing he&#39;s getting ready to leave), but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t nomrally get up to help him. He&#39;s missed the bus once.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me it would have been cruel to just expect that after a lifetime <br/>\nof never meeting the bus or school schedule that he ought to just <br/>\ndo it cold turkey. So I supported him until he could go it alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me that&#39;s what a lot of these issues are.<br/>\n<br/>\nInitially my kids may not be as able to set a bedtime that works <br/>\nfor them so I help the process by bathing or reading or <br/>\nsnuggling. I pick a time that makes sense to me for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as they get older, I gradually transfer the responsbility to the <br/>\nchild so that he/she regulate him/herself. My older kids don&#39;t <br/>\nhave bedtimes and haven&#39;t for years. My younger ones have a <br/>\nbedtime routine that gets chucked if a good TV show is on or we <br/>\nhave people over. But on the whole, they are in bed between 8:30 <br/>\nand 9:00 during this time of parental guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome might say that they are brewing a sense of anger toward <br/>\nus. But ironically my 11 year old just started mentioning that he&#39;d <br/>\nlike to decide when he goes to bed now. I think he&#39;ll do fine so <br/>\nwe&#39;re ready for him to do so. The younger two aren&#39;t as ready, in <br/>\nour estimation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, got my bull&#39;s-eye vest on! Fire away. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Honestly, I appreciate all the input. I really want to hash this stuff <br/>\nout and I&#39;m going to keep coming back with what I think so I can <br/>\nhear what you all think. No antagonism meant at all).<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132256168,"authorName":"HappyMato2@aol.com","from":"HappyMato2@...","profile":"home_ed4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] bedtime schedules","postDate":"1043338537","msgId":55886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwZC4xZWEyMjYwMy4yYjYxNmYyOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55885,"nextInTopic":55889,"prevInTime":55885,"nextInTime":55887,"topicId":55844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/22/03 9:44:10 PM Pacific Standard Time, ...

When we were on vacation, she could stay up as late <br/>\nas she wanted and she knew it.  We were gone for four nights.  It was a <br/>\nnightmare for everyone.  The trip wasn&#39;t fun and I&#39;d never do it again.  <br/>\nMaybe there are kids who can handle going to bed at different times at night, <br/>\nbut my kids can&#39;t.  We don&#39;t have power struggles and fights when it&#39;s <br/>\nbedtime.  My kids may argue about who gets to brush their teeth first or <br/>\nwhose turn is it to have their story read first, but the actual bedtime isn&#39;t <br/>\na problem most of the time.  Sometimes my daughter will get up from her bed <br/>\nand say she&#39;s having problems falling asleep.  I&#39;ll snuggle with her and <br/>\ncaress her face and she&#39;ll fall back to sleep.

They think its everyone <br/>\n&gt; *else* that is out of sorts, not them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kristen, that may be true for a kid who gets AN opportunity to stay up all <br/>\nnight or the rare opportunity to do so.  The truth is that I don&#39;t know all <br/>\nthe kids in the world, but has been my experience that when &#39;bedtime rules&#39; <br/>\nis not an issue, there&#39;s no reason to ignore the sensations that cause a <br/>\nkid to want to go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, there have never been any rules about when to go to bed.  My <br/>\nnow-8-year-old son really wants to go to bed when he gets sleepy, and he is <br/>\nthe one who makes that decision, nobody else.  Of course, if something is <br/>\ngoing on that makes it more interesting to stay awake despite being tired, <br/>\nthen he will try to stay awake (I would, too), but that is a rare <br/>\noccurrence, not the norm; when that guy gets tired, he craves going to <br/>\nbed.  He sleeps as long as he needs to or wants to, and I am assured that <br/>\nhe is in tune with his own sleep needs because I have never interfered with <br/>\nthem.  If we are out somewhere, bed can be my arms or someone&#39;s sofa, and <br/>\nhe can drift off just as easily there (even now at the age of 8) or on the <br/>\ncar ride home.  He can also stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning or beyond <br/>\nif there&#39;s something fun going on.  But, even if there&#39;s something fun <br/>\ngoing on, when he gets really tired, there&#39;s no keeping him awake, and he <br/>\nhas no reason to resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I piss him off because I can&#39;t stay awake to read to him as long <br/>\nas he can stay awake to be read to, but he is extremely sympathetic and <br/>\nwill &quot;allow&quot; me to shut the light off when I just can&#39;t stay awake any <br/>\nlonger.  Anyway, he&#39;s usually content to drift off to sleep by that time, <br/>\ntoo, but he knows that he is welcome to stay awake and play or look at a <br/>\nbook or do whatever he&#39;d like to do at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that when long-standing bedtime rules get lifted, the situation <br/>\nyou describe above may happen.  But, eventually, once a kid realizes that <br/>\nthe bedtime rules are really gone, staying awake after everyone else goes <br/>\noff to bed probably wouldn&#39;t be as exciting anymore and then a kid can <br/>\nstart to respond more to their body clock that tells them when to go to bed <br/>\nand when to get up.  In fact, a kid&#39;s need for going to bed may shift to <br/>\nmore of a night owl schedule, but if there&#39;s no need for early rising  in <br/>\nthe morning, what difference does it make?  I like what Sandra has said <br/>\nabout Kirby and his ability to manage his own bedtime schedule based on <br/>\nwhat&#39;s important to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, I don&#39;t know everyone in the world; this is only my <br/>\nexperience.  But, I do have the distant memory of resisting being sleepy if <br/>\nI had the chance to stay awake late, because bedtimes were strictly <br/>\nenforced when I was a wee one and I HATED it!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I have four kids 6 and under. One thing we have noticed with our oldest is that even before the age of 2 she wouldn&#39;t fall asleep until 10 or 10:30 most nights, even tho we consistently put her to bed between 8 and 8:30. She would just sit in the dark and sing songs or &quot;look&quot; at books. She is still the same now. We now let her stay up until between 9 & 9:30, then she reads books till 10 or 10:30. (She&#39;s a voracious reader.) Dh & I go to bed around 10:30 and we have to go in between 10 and 10:30 and make her turn her lamp off & put the book away! But I know this is her natural rhythm as it started at such a young age. She is also a slow waker-upper in the morning, and often is up an hour or so before she even gets hungry for breakfast. (She gets up around 8:00 a.m. most mornings.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy almost 5 yo dd, on the other hand, is high-energy and spirited like me and she crashes between 8:30 and 9 every night--totally fast asleep. She&#39;s also usually one of the first ones up in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 3.5 year old and 15 month are still taking a 2-3 hour nap every afternoon, and they are put to bed almost every night between 8 & 8:30. They are both usually asleep by 9 at the latest and get up between 7 and 8 in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this to say that I really think we have certain natural rhythms. I am spirited myself and my natural rhythms are very obvious in me and also very inconsistent--I go through periods where I can&#39;t sleep till Midnight and can&#39;t get up early, to other times when I crash by 10 and can get up between 5:30 and 6 every morning for a week or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and they are definitely not alllowed to get out of bed & come out of their room after they are put to bed. Sometimes we do let them look at books in bed for 15 minutes or so before lights go out. My kids share rooms & beds (& maybe we were strict enough or something) that this has never posed a problem. If they do come out now it is usually for an important reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nJerilyn in CO<br/>\nMoms & Dads working from home<br/>\nwww.momsforlife.funurl.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Cathy Hilde <br/>\n  To: &#39;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&#39; <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, January 23, 2003 12:39 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] bedtime schedules<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do any of you request your child to stay in their room when up after <br/>\n  everyone else has gone to bed?

I know for my kids it took several days,  on and off for a few months,  before they could realize how tired they were.   <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso,  since staying home from school, it is so exciting being able to do stuff at home and it is hard to settle down when one is excited.   I know it is for me.             But,  as the days, weeks, months go by,  they&#39;ll figure out that those things are there tomorrow and the next days;  going to bed will be OK.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy dd (8 yr)  has realized that she is very emotional when she is tired,  she knows to get to bed before she starts feeling that way and she&#39;ll sleep in.   My ds (9 yr) loves to stay up,  loves working on the computer, playing the PS2 and so on.   And we tell him when we are turning in,  sometimes he&#39;ll stay up,  sometimes he goes to bed.   The novelty of  staying up is going away.  Most of the time he&#39;ll want to go to bed when we go to bed.   He also sleeps in.       I do think its been the hardest with my 5 yr dd (I attribute it to me and my dh) I don&#39;t hear alot about  5 yr olds staying up until 10:00. (Except here)    I have to get past that.   She loves to stay up and she is finally learning to sleep in, not always but it is happening.   But I am learning that she doesn&#39;t need sleep like me.   She goes and goes.    So when I&#39;m tired I can&#39;t assume she&#39;s tired.    <br/>\n  <br/>\nWe also do lots of talking about sleep.    My 8 yr dd and I had lots of talks about it.  She&#39;d go to bed in tears, being so tired.  I let her know that I get that way too if I&#39;m too tired.   She hasn&#39;t done that now for several weeks.  We are learning together how to read our bodies.<br/>\n <br/>\nI keep telling myself:  patience,   and I also keep telling myself that my baby is growing up so fast and before long she&#39;ll be sleeping in and will want everyone to be quiet too!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFor all of these issues I think we all have to realize that it doesn&#39;t just click into place in a few days or weeks,  it might take months.  (Or years for us adults)   Especially when most of us parents are trying to think differently than how we were raised.       We aren&#39;t always going to be in our perfect &#39;Living Joyfully&#39; forms either, then that is going to set it back a little too.   Hopefully with time that persona will take over,  I think it eventually will.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorry for the length,<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> wrote:In a message dated 1/22/03 5:21:13 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My kids are not like that.

The truth is that I don&#39;t know all <br/>\nthe kids in the world, but has been my experience that when &#39;bedtime rules&#39; <br/>\nis not an issue, there&#39;s no reason to ignore the sensations that cause a <br/>\nkid to want to go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, there have never been any rules about when to go to bed.  My <br/>\nnow-8-year-old son really wants to go to bed when he gets sleepy, and he is <br/>\nthe one who makes that decision, nobody else.  Of course, if something is <br/>\ngoing on that makes it more interesting to stay awake despite being tired, <br/>\nthen he will try to stay awake (I would, too), but that is a rare <br/>\noccurrence, not the norm; when that guy gets tired, he craves going to <br/>\nbed.  He sleeps as long as he needs to or wants to, and I am assured that <br/>\nhe is in tune with his own sleep needs because I have never interfered with <br/>\nthem.  If we are out somewhere, bed can be my arms or someone&#39;s sofa, and <br/>\nhe can drift off just as easily there (even now at the age of 8) or on the <br/>\ncar ride home.  He can also stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning or beyond <br/>\nif there&#39;s something fun going on.  But, even if there&#39;s something fun <br/>\ngoing on, when he gets really tired, there&#39;s no keeping him awake, and he <br/>\nhas no reason to resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I piss him off because I can&#39;t stay awake to read to him as long <br/>\nas he can stay awake to be read to, but he is extremely sympathetic and <br/>\nwill &quot;allow&quot; me to shut the light off when I just can&#39;t stay awake any <br/>\nlonger.  Anyway, he&#39;s usually content to drift off to sleep by that time, <br/>\ntoo, but he knows that he is welcome to stay awake and play or look at a <br/>\nbook or do whatever he&#39;d like to do at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess is that when long-standing bedtime rules get lifted, the situation <br/>\nyou describe above may happen.  But, eventually, once a kid realizes that <br/>\nthe bedtime rules are really gone, staying awake after everyone else goes <br/>\noff to bed probably wouldn&#39;t be as exciting anymore and then a kid can <br/>\nstart to respond more to their body clock that tells them when to go to bed <br/>\nand when to get up.  In fact, a kid&#39;s need for going to bed may shift to <br/>\nmore of a night owl schedule, but if there&#39;s no need for early rising  in <br/>\nthe morning, what difference does it make?  I like what Sandra has said <br/>\nabout Kirby and his ability to manage his own bedtime schedule based on <br/>\nwhat&#39;s important to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, I don&#39;t know everyone in the world; this is only my <br/>\nexperience.  But, I do have the distant memory of resisting being sleepy if <br/>\nI had the chance to stay awake late, because bedtimes were strictly <br/>\nenforced when I was a wee one and I HATED it!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4257114,"authorName":"Cathy Hilde","from":"Cathy Hilde &lt;childe@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] bedtime schedules","postDate":"1043303975","msgId":55849,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxQzJDMjY3LjI0MjAxRUEwLmNoaWxkZUBzZXJ2aWNlcGFwZXIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55846,"nextInTopic":55853,"prevInTime":55848,"nextInTime":55850,"topicId":55844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do any of you request your child to stay in their room when up after everyone else has gone to bed?
