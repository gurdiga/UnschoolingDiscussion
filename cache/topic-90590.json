That is one of my favorite things <br/>\nto do because snuggling is great with hot cocoa or popcorn :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI use to be one of those moms that didn&#39;t like certain shows and one <br/>\nof those shows was Rug rats because they didn&#39;t speak correctly. I <br/>\nwould let my son watch it but I would tell him the part that bugged <br/>\nme. I don&#39;t worry about my son talking like them anymore so I kid <br/>\naround about the show and talk like them and it drives my son crazy <br/>\nLOL.................................................<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the dialogue with them is real important. If I am doing <br/>\nother things my son always runs where I am to tell me the funny part <br/>\nof what is happening. I get such a kick out of it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSonya<br/>\nAttleboro,Mass</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90582,"nextTopicId":90577}}
