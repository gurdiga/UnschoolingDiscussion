It&#39;s just a reminder of the<br/>\n<br/>\npower of phrases and a reminder for us to dissect language sometimes to<br/>\nstir <br/>\nout those lumps.<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes a phrase, especially if it was used on us as an insult or<br/>\nput-down, <br/>\ntends to take on a life of its own, a reality without basis.<br/>\n <br/>\nSame thing happens with &quot;spoiled brat&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re letting your kids run<br/>\nall <br/>\nover you,&quot; and &quot;How will they learn?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nPhrases become rock-hard pain to be avoided sometimes.<br/>\n <br/>\nInstead of thinking of it as whether you will or will not be a<br/>\nshort-order <br/>\ncook, how about trying to never think that question ever again.  Just<br/>\nbanish <br/>\nit.  Shove it down.<br/>\n <br/>\nInstead, think of what the value of being satisfied is.  Physically <br/>\nsatisfied.  Nourished.  Full.  Not needy.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf your child feels needy or unsatisfied, an insult won&#39;t satisfy him.<br/>\nMy mom tried that.  She failed dozens of times, but saw it as a failing<br/>\nin <br/>\nME, not in her.<br/>\nShe told me, when I said &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; variants from &quot;No you&#39;re not&quot; to<br/>\n&quot;You <br/>\nhave never been hungry a day in your life.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nProbably she heard those things from her parents, and rather than really <br/>\nthink about what it might mean to me to have my mother hand me some food<br/>\nwith <br/>\na smile and a hug, she decided she didn&#39;t HAVE to do that, and maybe she <br/>\ncould train me to stop asking.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51404,"nextTopicId":51408}}
