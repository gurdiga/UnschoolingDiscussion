There&#39;s a fly-on-<br/>\nthe-wall series over here about Heathrow airport, including the <br/>\nkennels and animal care centre.  Two beautiful Newfoundlands <br/>\ngot shipped from Canada (a 12 hour flight) in boxes taht were too <br/>\nsmall, so they couldn&#39;t lie down.  The bloke who found them was <br/>\nspitting mad!  Basically, when measuring dogs for travel boxes, <br/>\nthey&#39;re supposed to take the full head-to-tail length and add the <br/>\n&#39;forearm&#39; length, without which, a dog can&#39;t lie down.  These poor <br/>\nanimals had stood up for over 12 hours!!!  ugh!!  Here in the UK, <br/>\nthey are trying to bring in &#39;pet passports,&#39; id chips or somesuch to <br/>\nreduce the time spent in Q (and the cost!  yes the owner pays for <br/>\n6 months kenneling fees...)  And the quarantine regs are so strict <br/>\nfor a good reason, rabies is rife in Europe and it&#39;s extremely rare <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13031,"nextTopicId":8995}}
