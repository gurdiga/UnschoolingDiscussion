Mostly because mucking is at her core but also she likes being in control of something and creating. She has dragged her brother to tea parties since he was 1 yo. Now they have snacks on the floor picninc style or set up in a cafe style complete with menus or simply in various bring along containers that their &quot;imaginary friends&#39; can enjoy along with their games. Whatever the format though there are far too many snack times around here that I have &quot;nothing&quot; to do with (except the cleaning afterwards lol) than I can count. If I ever need a break I simply make sure the fridge is stcked with fruits and cheese, my kids can find their way to making a day long activity out of snack time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Angela <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, March 09, 2003 8:42 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling &household chores<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids at ages 6 and 8 have no interest in getting themselves something to<br/>\n  eat either.

I find that involving my kids on a as desired basis in cooking and cleaning helps immensely in many ways. First I don&#39;t worry if I have to stay in bed sick I know my kids even at 7 & under can make some sort of meal for themselves. Don&#39;t laugh but I know homes where this just isn&#39;t the case. <br/>\n    My 7yo loves making scrambled eggs and setting up breakfast for us late risers. This is something I was never allowed to do as a kids...Mom did the cooking period. Of course you have to be willing to get a bit messy and things don&#39;t go as fast when you do them with kids but isn&#39;t that part of learning. <br/>\n    I think she has gained a lot from the independance and trust we &quot;give&quot; her by allowing her to do this cooking by herself. I guess in the big picture it does show her life skills for the future but I am more concerned for what it does for her in the present. I think it is much like my view of a lot of this parenting thing if you do it in little bits all the time it is no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla, not dreading the big sex talk cause there never will be one and not dreading thinking my kids will have to live on KD in University till they figure out the directions on the oven.<br/>\n   It really isn&#39;t that hard to learn to do laundry.  I managed to navigate the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; Laundromat in my 20&#39;s, There are DIRECTIONS on the back of every box of Tide or Gain or Cheer. NOT <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  just the first box you buy---but EVERY single one, for the rest of your <br/>\n  laundry detergent buying days!<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I died tomorrow, I really don&#39;t think that laundry would never be done <br/>\n  again. Either Ben would take over, Cameron would, or Duncan would. Or they&#39;d <br/>\n  all pitch in together. They might hire someone to come in to do laundry once <br/>\n  a week or take it all to the cleaners. They can all do laundry now; they&#39;d <br/>\n  just rather that I do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Same with cooking. I do most of it. Everyone can and does occasionally. If I <br/>\n  died tomorrow, their options would be to go out to eat, hire a cook, used <br/>\n  prepackaged junk, or to get the cookbooks out and experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To think that I would force &quot;lessons&quot; on them so that they would be able to <br/>\n  do it later (and we all know that &quot;later&quot; might not come) is ridiculous. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It might make sense if my world revolved around school and a school-like <br/>\n  world, but it doesn&#39;t. We&#39;re living real life NOW---&quot;as if school didn&#39;t <br/>\n  exist&quot;. And the boys will learn what they need to WHEN they need to . I am <br/>\n  ALWAYS available to answer questions and to help work out solutions, even <br/>\n  when they&#39;re forty.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
