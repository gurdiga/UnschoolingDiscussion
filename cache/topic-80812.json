Fear of exposing breasts is a big reason more women don&#39;t <br/>\nbreastfeed in the first place and many breastfeeding experts are starting to <br/>\ntalk about the need to change our cultural perception of breasts if we are ever <br/>\nto have a fully breastfeeding culture.  Katherine Dettwyler, an <br/>\nanthropologist at (I think) UT has done cross cultural studies about whether or not breasts <br/>\nare viewed as sexual.  (I believe the article is called &quot;Beauty and the <br/>\nBreast&quot; and it&#39;s in a book she co-edited.)  Ours (US) is one of only two or three <br/>\ncultures worldwide (I believe she looked at more than 50) which view breasts as <br/>\nsexual.  Many many women are conflicted about breastfeeding in our culture <br/>\nbecause of this.  In other places, that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for.  In the US, <br/>\nit&#39;s kind of muddled and it affects the health of babies and their mothers in a <br/>\nsignificant way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Does our government guarantee the right to nurse in public?  I&#39;ll have to<br/>\n&gt;find out.  This much I do know;  People in our country *are* guaranteed<br/>\n&gt;the right to their outdated morality. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the last few years, quite a few states have passed &quot;right to breastfeed in <br/>\npublic&quot; laws, saying you have a right to nurse in public anywhere you have a <br/>\nright to be.  (Although there was that woman who nursed while driving....can&#39;t <br/>\nlegislate good judgment I guess!)  Most of these laws state that it is not <br/>\nindecent exposure to show the breast for purposes of breastfeeding.  So legally, <br/>\nin these states, a mother does have the right to be exposed, regardless of <br/>\nother people&#39;s comfort levels. The laws came about because people were and still <br/>\nare being harassed for nursing in public.  (Often at swimming places, by <br/>\nlifeguards, even when women are being discreet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitudes towards breasts do affect whether people breastfeed or not.  Where <br/>\nI live breastfeeding is very public, but people tell me when they visit some <br/>\nparts of the US, no one does it publicly and they&#39;re very intimidated from <br/>\nnursing outside the home.  I, being a product of my culture, have always tried to <br/>\nbe discreet as I breastfeed in public.  And it&#39;s true that it&#39;s very possible <br/>\nto nurse discreetly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn La Leche League, we are careful to help women fit breastfeeding in with <br/>\nthis culture we live in.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that the culture is not a real <br/>\nobstacle to breastfeeding.  It is.  Because of that, I have a certain <br/>\nadmiration for  the women who do &quot;whip it out.&quot;  Out there at the margins, I think they <br/>\nhave the effect of making the discreet women feel safer.  Even discreet women <br/>\nare going to feel &quot;exposed&quot; if the local custom is to hide under those <br/>\nelaborate cover-ups or worse, if most nursing women bottle-fed in public due to <br/>\nshame.  The women who choose to be &quot;indiscreet&quot; are changing the culture, the way <br/>\nflappers in the 1920s did.  It shocked; but it spread.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pam T.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80799,"nextTopicId":80855}}
