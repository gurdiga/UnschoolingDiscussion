I realized my <br/>\nmain concern was not &quot;getting them motivated&quot; or &quot;getting them to do <br/>\nsomething&quot; but rather to just keep better track of what was <br/>\nhappening. So I will instead be implementing a simple spreadsheet <br/>\nfor each student where I can check off anything from when I&#39;ve been <br/>\npaid to which scales have been done, whether a song has been <br/>\nmemorized, etc. The students can see their accomplishments/progress <br/>\nand I can have a better idea of what&#39;s going on with everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I&#39;ll have some cheap toys at our piano pizza parties, as <br/>\nsort of party favors. Or maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case you&#39;re curious ... the reasons I decided against the prizes <br/>\nwas because 1) Frankly, it seemed like a lot of work and hassle to <br/>\nhave to worry about; 2) Even though I think the kids would like it, <br/>\nI just couldn&#39;t get past the idea of feeling like I&#39;d be treating <br/>\nthem like trained seals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks a lot for the food for thought. I enjoy this list a <br/>\nlot, even though I rarely post.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107465,"nextTopicId":107288}}
