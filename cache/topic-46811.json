Try to imagine the world from your child&#39;s point of view, purposefully<br/>\nletting go of your own. Do this every day for at least a few moments to<br/>\nremind you of who this child is and what he or she faces in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Imagine how you appear and sound from your child&#39;s point of view, i.e.,<br/>\nhaving you as a parent today, in this moment. How might this modify how you<br/>\ncarry yourself in your body and in space, how you speak, and what you say?<br/>\nHow do you want to relate to your child in this moment?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Practice seeing your children as perfect just the way they are. See if<br/>\nyou can stay mindful of their sovereignty from moment to moment, and work at<br/>\naccepting them as they are when it is hardest for you to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Be mindful of your expectations of your children and consider whether<br/>\nthey are truly in your child&#39;s best interest. Also, be aware of how you<br/>\ncommunicate those expectations and how they affect your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Practice altruism, putting the needs of your children above your own<br/>\nwhenever possible. Then see if there isn&#39;t some common ground, where your<br/>\ntrue needs can also be met. You may be surprised at how much overlap is<br/>\npossible, especially if you are patient and strive for balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. When you feel lost, or at a loss, remember to stand still and meditate on<br/>\nthe whole by bringing your full attention to the situation, to your child,<br/>\nto yourself, to the family. In doing so, you may go beyond thinking, even<br/>\ngood thinking, and perceive intuitively, with the whole of your being, what<br/>\nneeds to be done. If that is not clear in any moment, maybe the best thing<br/>\nis to not do anything until it becomes clearer. Sometimes it is good to<br/>\nremain silent.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Try embodying silent presence. This will grow out of both formal and<br/>\ninformal mindfulness practice over time if you attend to how you carry<br/>\nyourself and what you project in body, mind, and speech. Listen carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Learn to live with tension without losing your own balance. In Zen and<br/>\nthe Art of Archery, Herrigel describes how he was taught to stand at the<br/>\npoint of highest tension effortlessly without shooting the arrow. At the<br/>\nright moment, the arrow mysteriously shoots itself. Practice moving into any<br/>\nmoment, however difficult, without trying to change anything and without<br/>\nhaving to have a particular outcome occur. Simply bring your full awareness<br/>\nand presence to this moment. Practice seeing that whatever comes up is<br/>\n&quot;workable&quot; if you are willing to trust your intuition. Your child needs you<br/>\nto be a center of balance and trustworthiness, a reliable landmark by which<br/>\nhe or she can take a bearing within his or her own landscape. Arrow and<br/>\ntarget need each other. They will find each other best through wise<br/>\nattention and patience.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Apologize to your child when you have betrayed a trust in even a little<br/>\nway. Apologies are healing. An apology demonstrates that you have thought<br/>\nabout a situation and have come to see it more clearly, or perhaps more from<br/>\nyour child&#39;s point of view. But be mindful of being &quot;sorry&quot; too often. It<br/>\nloses its meaning if you are always saying it, making regret into a habit.<br/>\nThen it can become a way not to take responsibility for your actions.<br/>\nCooking in remorse on occasion is a good meditation. Don&#39;t shut off the<br/>\nstove until the meal is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Every child is special, and every child has special needs. Each sees in<br/>\nan entirely unique way. Hold an image of each child in your heart. Drink in<br/>\ntheir being, wishing them well.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. There are important times when we need to be clear and strong and<br/>\nunequivocal with children. Let this come as much as possible out of<br/>\nawareness, generosity, and discernment, rather than out of fear,<br/>\nself-righteousness, or the desire to control. Mindful parenting does not<br/>\nmean being overindulgent, neglectful, or weak; nor does it mean being rigid,<br/>\ndomineering, and controlling.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. The greatest gift you can give your child is your self. This means that<br/>\npart of your work as a parent is to keep growing in self-knowledge and<br/>\nawareness. This ongoing work can be furthered by making a time for quiet<br/>\ncontemplation in whatever ways feel comfortable to us. We only have right<br/>\nnow. Let us use it to its best advantage, for our children&#39;s sake, and for<br/>\nour own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn is the author of Wherever You Go, There<br/>\nYou Are.

In some school<br/>\n&gt; districts, 20 percent of the students are medicated,<br/>\n&gt; lining up each day at the<br/>\n&gt; nurse&#39;s office to receive their midday dose. With<br/>\n&gt; such staggering numbers, one<br/>\n&gt; would think there is indisputable evidence that ADD<br/>\n&gt; exists and that Ritalin is<br/>\n&gt; the ideal way to treat it.

The ADD Hoax is an<br/>\n&gt; in-depth look at the crime being committed against<br/>\n&gt; our children--children who<br/>\n&gt; are &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADD and then exposed to the<br/>\n&gt; effects of Ritalin, a drug<br/>\n&gt; with massive distribution that is matched in volume<br/>\n&gt; only by the number of<br/>\n&gt; uncertainties surrounding it.

Try to imagine the world from your child&#39;s point of view, purposefully<br/>\nletting go of your own. Do this every day for at least a few moments to<br/>\nremind you of who this child is and what he or she faces in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Imagine how you appear and sound from your child&#39;s point of view, i.e.,<br/>\nhaving you as a parent today, in this moment. How might this modify how you<br/>\ncarry yourself in your body and in space, how you speak, and what you say?<br/>\nHow do you want to relate to your child in this moment?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Practice seeing your children as perfect just the way they are. See if<br/>\nyou can stay mindful of their sovereignty from moment to moment, and work at<br/>\naccepting them as they are when it is hardest for you to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Be mindful of your expectations of your children and consider whether<br/>\nthey are truly in your child&#39;s best interest. Also, be aware of how you<br/>\ncommunicate those expectations and how they affect your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Practice altruism, putting the needs of your children above your own<br/>\nwhenever possible. Then see if there isn&#39;t some common ground, where your<br/>\ntrue needs can also be met. You may be surprised at how much overlap is<br/>\npossible, especially if you are patient and strive for balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. When you feel lost, or at a loss, remember to stand still and meditate on<br/>\nthe whole by bringing your full attention to the situation, to your child,<br/>\nto yourself, to the family. In doing so, you may go beyond thinking, even<br/>\ngood thinking, and perceive intuitively, with the whole of your being, what<br/>\nneeds to be done. If that is not clear in any moment, maybe the best thing<br/>\nis to not do anything until it becomes clearer. Sometimes it is good to<br/>\nremain silent.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Try embodying silent presence. This will grow out of both formal and<br/>\ninformal mindfulness practice over time if you attend to how you carry<br/>\nyourself and what you project in body, mind, and speech. Listen carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Learn to live with tension without losing your own balance. In Zen and<br/>\nthe Art of Archery, Herrigel describes how he was taught to stand at the<br/>\npoint of highest tension effortlessly without shooting the arrow. At the<br/>\nright moment, the arrow mysteriously shoots itself. Practice moving into any<br/>\nmoment, however difficult, without trying to change anything and without<br/>\nhaving to have a particular outcome occur. Simply bring your full awareness<br/>\nand presence to this moment. Practice seeing that whatever comes up is<br/>\n&quot;workable&quot; if you are willing to trust your intuition. Your child needs you<br/>\nto be a center of balance and trustworthiness, a reliable landmark by which<br/>\nhe or she can take a bearing within his or her own landscape. Arrow and<br/>\ntarget need each other. They will find each other best through wise<br/>\nattention and patience.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Apologize to your child when you have betrayed a trust in even a little<br/>\nway. Apologies are healing. An apology demonstrates that you have thought<br/>\nabout a situation and have come to see it more clearly, or perhaps more from<br/>\nyour child&#39;s point of view. But be mindful of being &quot;sorry&quot; too often. It<br/>\nloses its meaning if you are always saying it, making regret into a habit.<br/>\nThen it can become a way not to take responsibility for your actions.<br/>\nCooking in remorse on occasion is a good meditation. Don&#39;t shut off the<br/>\nstove until the meal is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Every child is special, and every child has special needs. Each sees in<br/>\nan entirely unique way. Hold an image of each child in your heart. Drink in<br/>\ntheir being, wishing them well.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. There are important times when we need to be clear and strong and<br/>\nunequivocal with children. Let this come as much as possible out of<br/>\nawareness, generosity, and discernment, rather than out of fear,<br/>\nself-righteousness, or the desire to control. Mindful parenting does not<br/>\nmean being overindulgent, neglectful, or weak; nor does it mean being rigid,<br/>\ndomineering, and controlling.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. The greatest gift you can give your child is your self. This means that<br/>\npart of your work as a parent is to keep growing in self-knowledge and<br/>\nawareness. This ongoing work can be furthered by making a time for quiet<br/>\ncontemplation in whatever ways feel comfortable to us. We only have right<br/>\nnow. Let us use it to its best advantage, for our children&#39;s sake, and for<br/>\nour own.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn is the author of Wherever You Go, There<br/>\nYou Are.

The place just gets to a certain point and I go &quot;aaaaagh!&quot; <br/>\nand pick up, just to save my sanity. This happens frequently. my <br/>\nmom&#39;s place is still very cluttered, but not trashed like it was (no <br/>\nkids to help it along!) My mom isn&#39;t as bugged by clutter as I am, <br/>\nand so I do more picking up than she does. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis comes back to that modeling thing, too.

If that&#39;s true, I don&#39;t understand<br/>\nhow they do it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really what&#39;s important to you and making the time to do what matters. <br/>\nI have a 17 year old who pretty much cleans up after herself. I do all <br/>\nlaundry though and occasionally glasses and plates from her as well. The <br/>\nother three are 8, 7 (today) and 2. They DON&#39;T clean up after themselves <br/>\nregularly without me asking. Then there&#39;s my husband who is just as bad as <br/>\nthe 2 year old!!! It&#39;s important to me to have a clean neat house. On any <br/>\ngiven day, you can walk in here and find order. Sometimes toys are on the <br/>\nfloor but very rarely looking like a tornado. The kids rooms on the other <br/>\nhand do look like that. I have a hard time seeing it, but it&#39;s their rooms <br/>\nand I bite my tongue a lot. I do need to be able to get into a room in the <br/>\ndark at night without killing myself. So I ask for at least a path. We can <br/>\nall live with that. I also need to vacuum in there occasionally. More the <br/>\ntwo girls room than my sons. The baby takes food in her room that she shares <br/>\nwith her sister so crumbs abound. I need to vacuum the rug at least every <br/>\nother day. The girls are good and I usually get in there every day. My son <br/>\nis a different story. I get in there with the vacuum once a week if I&#39;m <br/>\nlucky. His floor is scattered with bits of paper and games he&#39;s making. It <br/>\nbothers me but I live with it. He needs to clean tomorrow as we are having a <br/>\nhouse  full and he knows he can&#39;t play with kids in there as there is no <br/>\nfloor room left. The playroom is mostly mine to clean. Only because it <br/>\nbothers me to see it messed. It&#39;s a playroom so the kids don&#39;t need it neat. <br/>\nNeither does my husband. I do. Therefore I clean it. Most of the time, kids <br/>\npitch in when they see me cleaning. Sometimes I ask, sometimes not. The <br/>\nyoungest will say no to helping, the others don&#39;t. I breeze through the <br/>\nhouse often picking up every chance I get. That way it&#39;s not overwhelming. <br/>\nMy mom can&#39;t stand to talk to me because she can&#39;t keep up with me. I&#39;m <br/>\nconstantly from one room to another taking care of whatever needs taking <br/>\ncare of. That&#39;s not just cleaning but dogs, cats and kids as well. It&#39;s what <br/>\nI do and what I do well and it&#39;s important to me. Just because someone <br/>\nthinks someone else will see there house as messy is no reason to frett over <br/>\nwhat it looks like. If it&#39;s a problem, then just do it. If not, it will get <br/>\ndone eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
