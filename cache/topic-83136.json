One thing that is especially hard is that the parents are being<br/>\npressured by the school to back up the &quot;discipline&quot; when the parents don&#39;t<br/>\ngive a shit about the worksheets and the silly rules.

She&#39;s worried having him full-time wouldn&#39;t be best for him<br/>\nbut<br/>\nreally hates the idea of sending him to school another day where he&#39;s<br/>\nmiserable.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nAs someone else mentioned, it need not be a set-in-stone forever<br/>\ndecision to take him out for now. (heh,heh,heh) I think it would help to<br/>\npoint out to her that the specific behaviors that you mention are<br/>\ntotally caused by school, and by school&#39;s intrusion into his home in the<br/>\nform of homework. It may help her to remember how he was at home prior<br/>\nto going to school for the first time. Perhaps she feels overwhelmed<br/>\n*because* she is conflicted in her heart, rather than conflicted because<br/>\nshe is overwhelmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other idea that may help her feel more confident is that just<br/>\nbecause he is not in school, does not mean that she has to be<br/>\nresponsible for filling his time 24 hours a day. I am with Jayn (now 4)<br/>\nmost of the time, but her Dad takes her out fairly often, and she does<br/>\nballet for an hour once a week, when I get to chat with the other hs&#39;ing<br/>\nmoms at the class. Sometimes she plays with other kids. She also spends<br/>\na lot of time watching DVD&#39;s, engaging in self-directed fantasy play<br/>\nwith her dolls, playing computer games (minimal help needed), and doing<br/>\nher craft projects. It actually surprises me how much time I get to sit<br/>\nat the computer sometimes. If Jayn had a grandmother near, and not<br/>\nnutty, I would have even more time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are online, I would also direct them to www.naturalchild.org<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/\">http://www.naturalchild.org/</a>&gt;   for respectful parenting info. At any<br/>\nrate I like that site, and it has helped me. That way the parenting and<br/>\nthe educational choices aren&#39;t intertwined. We know them as intertwined<br/>\nbecause we are further along on the journey of Unschooling as lifestyle<br/>\nchoice, but it may help your friend with her worries. Gentle mindful<br/>\nparenting strategies will help her regardless of whether they bring<br/>\ntheir boy home from school or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;especially as the teacher is saying that this child will<br/>\nnever learn to overcome his social problems if he&#39;s not in school.&gt;&gt;<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to let go of our ingrained respect for &quot;experts&quot; - ingrained<br/>\nby school itself. However the teacher is hampered by both self-interest,<br/>\nand his/her own biased education. What do grade school teachers get<br/>\nnowadays - one semester of &quot;child psychology&quot; or &quot;classroom management&quot;<br/>\ntechniques designed to suppress the individual to make the group more<br/>\ncohesive???? I don&#39;t know, nor is that my point. My point is that your<br/>\nfriends may be giving the teacher&#39;s opinion an undeserved weight simply<br/>\nbecause of the habit of a lifetime and the teacher&#39;s status as an<br/>\nexpert. Your friends are the experts in their son. <br/>\n<br/>\nWas it Mary or Anne speaking at the conference about how she had an<br/>\nepiphany when she asked the school principal what the school&#39;s goals<br/>\nwere for her child? Maybe these parents need to examine what the<br/>\nteacher&#39;s goals are, implied or explicit, for their son. Are they goals<br/>\nthey would *want* to support? Are they goals that require school, and<br/>\nonly school, to achieve them? Are they goals that only relate to school<br/>\n(e.g. ability to work quietly in a large group not of his choosing, on a<br/>\nproject not of his choosing, for a time frame not of his choosing). I<br/>\nthink the teacher is betraying ignorance and bias just by the use of the<br/>\nlabel of &quot;his&quot; social &quot;problems&quot;. If they are social problems by<br/>\ndefinition wouldn&#39;t the group be at least partly to &quot;blame&quot;? Perhaps<br/>\nshe/he is feeling like a failure and can&#39;t deal with it. &quot;Never&quot; is a<br/>\npretty portentous word, a pretty final word, a pretty definitive word to<br/>\nuse in reference to a six or seven year old. I guess none of us have<br/>\never changed in our personality or actions or likes or social abilities<br/>\nsince we were six, so it is clear that these are the most crucial years<br/>\nto mold him to a fitting cog in the machine. Oh now I&#39;m just getting<br/>\nirritated with that dopey teacher, much like you wanting to say<br/>\n&quot;aarrrggghh!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Potential new unschooler","postDate":"1066883752","msgId":83142,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJuN2xyOCszc2szQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWMzOThlYyQ1YWM2ODdkMCQyOWIxYjVkMEB3aW5kb3dzMms4d3pnbT4="},"prevInTopic":83139,"nextInTopic":83147,"prevInTime":83141,"nextInTime":83143,"topicId":83136,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
