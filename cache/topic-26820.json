I<br/>\nreally need to go in with a list of books to check for, I can&#39;t just go<br/>\nlook. There are so many books and I just can&#39;t seem to deal with it. We do<br/>\ngo every week, but I never require anyone to come and I always go with a<br/>\nlist. I am with the kids that say to keep it short. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children&#39;s section of many libraries is the worst for people like me.<br/>\nThey often are not even alphabitized! Trying to find a book is hard. My<br/>\ncurrent library(in Maine) is better than the last(in Kodiak, AK).<br/>\n<br/>\nI only allow my kids to bring home one book, I have any more and they don&#39;t<br/>\nget read. My 9 yo is the only exception, and I often take home two myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my family books are like toys. When we throw them all in a big toy box<br/>\nnothing gets played with, but when they are in smaller containers they do.<br/>\nEven better is when I separate the toys and place them around the house. I<br/>\nguess soem of us are just easily overwhelmed. Teehee.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sheri</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26778,"nextTopicId":26808}}
