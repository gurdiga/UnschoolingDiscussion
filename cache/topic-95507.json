I&#39;ve always used a<br/>\nMaya wrap until my newest was born (I have dd 4.5, ds 2, and ds 3m,<br/>\nand now I use wrap carriers I made for $2.50 each via the instructions<br/>\non the website -- I tied him on my back when he was 1 week old and<br/>\nhave gardened, washed the car (without getting him wet!), hung<br/>\nlaundry, played tag, cuddled little ones w/scraped knees, etc.  If you<br/>\nare still set on a ring-sling after looking through mamatoto, check<br/>\nout thebabywearer.com for links to free instructions for making ring<br/>\nslings, pouches, and Asian-style baby carriers. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more unschooly note, my daughter loves looking through &quot;Babies<br/>\nCelebrated&quot; with me, which shows babies from myriad traditional and<br/>\ntribal cultures being carried, bathed, fed, etc.  And the mamatoto.org<br/>\nsite is lots of fun because she not only breaks carries into age and<br/>\nfront/back/hip, but into culture (Japanese, Tibetan, etc.)  Fun for<br/>\nlittle ones (or big ones!) interested in mothering and babies. <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95468,"nextTopicId":95499}}
