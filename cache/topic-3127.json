Have you heard of<br/>\nMarriage Encounter? It&#39;s a weekend designed to help good marriages into<br/>\ngreat ones. The weekend focuses on just the two of you and improving<br/>\ncommunication between you. It&#39;s not a retreat, nor a marriage clinic, nor<br/>\ngroup sensitivity. It&#39;s a unique approach aimed at revitalizing Christian<br/>\nmarriage. Sounds like you might enjoy a weekend alone with your dh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went 3 years ago (married 16 yrs) and it helped us a lot. I don&#39;t think<br/>\nwe would have even started homeschooling this year if we could not discuss<br/>\nthe ideas and be more open to each others feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it.
