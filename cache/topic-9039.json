If you are in So Cal you can contact the lady<br/>\nthat does these.  They were wonderful and reasonable (I think $55 for 8 4x6 <br/>\nprints).  A couple of the pics were just us posing together and one of naked <br/>\nbaby, no parts exposed LOL.  If you aren&#39;t in the area I would say contact<br/>\nLLL International to find a local group or see if they have someone to refer<br/>\nyou too.  I would&#39;t feel comfortable with just anyone taking these pics thats<br/>\nfor sure, as I was half naked myself (underware and a denim shirt open, <br/>\nbaby naked...very nice, she covers you up so that you aren&#39;t hanging all out<br/>\nor stretch marks exposed etc!)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;kworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"DV7sC8FlY8-pavH3u1PaPxSXKgNBuYlnPSX1S3eZ9ZrxktilYxtv1YDjNBa5Qgghsdhuxifk6KbxFBQFoNOXWi1npo8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] pictures","postDate":"960510594","msgId":9040,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjUwMWJmZDFhOSRkNWU2OTU4MCRkM2E0ODAxOEBuZS5tZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGM5LjViYTg3NzEuMjY3MTYyZjlAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9039,"nextInTopic":9106,"prevInTime":9039,"nextInTime":9041,"topicId":9039,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My aunt took a picture of me nursing dd#1 7 years ago .I think I ll ask her for a copy of it.
