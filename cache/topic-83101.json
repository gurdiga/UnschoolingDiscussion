You&#39;re taught to be a passive,<br/>\n&gt; obedient follower. And unless you can break out of those habits, you&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; a victim of propoganda. But it&#39;s not that hard to break out.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And, congratulations to each of you for breaking out - and for raising<br/>\n&gt; critical thinkers!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aloha, Lee<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83100,"nextTopicId":83117}}
