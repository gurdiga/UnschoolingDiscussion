My experience with kids under the <br/>\ngov&#39;t system has been about the same, and I know many more government <br/>\nschooled kids than homeschooled kids. They don&#39;t know how to play! A <br/>\nboy up the street, Robby&#39;s age, always wants to sit in front of the <br/>\nTV or computer when he&#39;s here, and when Robby goes up to his house, <br/>\nthey watch TV the whole time, unless the kid&#39;s mom says &quot;Outside!&quot; My <br/>\nkids have always &quot;acted their ages&quot; i.e....like KIDS! When I see <br/>\nyoung kids emulating Brittney...ugh. Makes me sick, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I was wrong about Robby wanting back on the computer today. After <br/>\nI got done, he wanted lunch, and then we worked on his solar system. <br/>\nWe&#39;re making a big solar system in the whole house: 7ft. sun at one <br/>\nend, and we&#39;ve *tried* to make it to scale ROFLOL LOL LMBO ain&#39;t <br/>\nhappening. Jupiter is HUMONGOUS!!! L So, we were busy with that for a <br/>\nlong time, and now he&#39;s out riding his bike again. He hasn&#39;t been <br/>\nback to the computer since before breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;what do you think his <br/>\n&gt; computer time will lead to that is so bad?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, your imagery of some loser type, having no life but his online <br/>\ngames and chat rooms...that isn&#39;t far off the mark, I guess. I know <br/>\nsome young men who pretty much play computer games. I&#39;m not talking <br/>\nabout teens, either. Early 20&#39;s and still slouching along quite <br/>\nirresponsibly. But these guys weren&#39;t unschooled, either. They are <br/>\nhigh school grads. <br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, thanks again. I&#39;m most definitely coming outside my own box <br/>\nhere.

Why make them grow up fast or worry <br/>\nabout what they will be doing when they are 25??<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have many school kids my childrens age to go by. One I often look at <br/>\nis my oldest&#39;s cousin who is the same age as my Joseph. Joseph can be <br/>\ndownright goofy when he&#39;s out playing around. He&#39;s a happy kid who doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncare what people think. Today he was dancing in the aisles at the grocery <br/>\nstore with not a care in the world until a lady commented on his new dance <br/>\nstyle. He only stopped long enough to hug me and then kept right on dancing. <br/>\nI&#39;ve formed conga lines in that same store with my 3 youngest and could care <br/>\nless what people probably think. Fortunately most laugh. Haven&#39;t had any <br/>\njoin in yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I digress. Point is when I see him around school kids his age, he tends <br/>\nto seem somewhat more juvenile than most. But you know what? He&#39;s only 8 <br/>\nyears old. That&#39;s exactly what I could hope for from him. Being a silly kid <br/>\ndoing things kids should be doing. The previous cousin I was speaking of is <br/>\nnothing at all like Joseph or Sierra. She is only a few months older than <br/>\nJoseph and when she has been here on occasion, she doesn&#39;t really play with <br/>\nmy kids. She starts to but doesn&#39;t seem to be interested. She wants to go in <br/>\nwith Tara (who&#39;s 17) and dance and sing and look at her clothes and makeup. <br/>\nShe&#39;s a little Britanny Spears wannabe who is obsessed by what she wears and <br/>\nhow she looks. She&#39;s also overweight and every other week on a diet with her <br/>\nmom. She barely spends any time on the computer compared to my 2 who do a <br/>\nlot and also on TV and gameboy and playstation. I wouldn&#39;t trade that for <br/>\nanything in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee my point? If not, I&#39;ll just chalk it up to my rambling!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57083,"nextTopicId":57024}}
