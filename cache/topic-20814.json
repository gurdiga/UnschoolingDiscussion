I<br/>\nremember reading &#39;Wind and the Willow&#39; to my son when<br/>\nhe was five, and I *knew* he didn&#39;t understand most of<br/>\nwhat he was hearing, but he wanted me to read it.  I<br/>\nasked him why, and he said &#39;The words sound so pretty<br/>\nwhen you are reading them, I just like to listen to<br/>\nthem&#39;.  Well!  So he soaked up the rhythm and flow and<br/>\nmusicality of good writing... certainly nothing to be<br/>\nsneezed at there!<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you are doing a wonderful job of enriching<br/>\nyour children&#39;s lives...<br/>\n<br/>\nEileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- A &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mumsienc@...\">mumsienc@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; We are headed off to the porch to snuggle up and<br/>\n&gt; read more of Pippi<br/>\n&gt; Longstocking.
