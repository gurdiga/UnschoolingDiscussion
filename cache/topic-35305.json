He is an only grandchild to my parents and I think they <br/>\nworry more about him than they did about me when I was little! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBonni mentioned reading -- yes, I think he&#39;s trying to teach himself to <br/>\nread. He has memorized lots of books (mostly Dr. Seuss) and &quot;reads&quot; them to <br/>\nhimself moving his finger under the words. He&#39;s learned a lot of sight words <br/>\nthat way and likes to pick them out when he sees them on signs or on TV or <br/>\non the computer. I think he is trying to teach himself to sound things out <br/>\n-- at least beginning sounds. He saw a violin on TV the other day, for <br/>\nexample, and turned to me and said, &quot;Violin! A violin ducka V!&quot; He uses the <br/>\nword ducka when he doesn&#39;t know how to pronounce or say something. :) But he <br/>\ndoes this with lots of words and tries to figure out the beginning sound and <br/>\nwhat letter the word starts with from listening to it. He can sound out some <br/>\nsimple words like dog and cup etc. Every time we pull into the driveway he <br/>\nsays Duh-aaawwww-g! and points to the &quot;beware of&quot; sign. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m just paranoid about pushing him. I was even considering some <br/>\nsort of alphabet detox for him -- but I&#39;m not going to do that I guess. He <br/>\nknows all the letters and what sound they make (short vowel and hard <br/>\nconsonant). I think if his goal is to learn to read I&#39;ll help him do it... <br/>\none of his challenges right now is that he can &quot;read&quot; better than he can <br/>\npronounce.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had been working with him on learning his letters -- we were doing one a <br/>\nweek, but he got way way way ahead of me :) So I guess I felt a little <br/>\nguilty that maybe I introduced him to this all too soon. I don&#39;t know why I <br/>\nwould think that -- at his age I was reading primers and sounding out words. <br/>\nBut I didn&#39;t have the same level of intensity and addiction that he has, <br/>\naccording to my parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for all the advice! I really appreciate it. I think this kid <br/>\nis much smarter than either of his parents :) and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll continue <br/>\nchallenging me as he gets older... it&#39;s nice to have people to ask questions <br/>\nand get opinions. :) He is a humbling experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nLILY<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35391,"nextTopicId":35392}}
