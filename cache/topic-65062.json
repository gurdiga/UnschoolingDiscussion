I would just say, &quot;Lots of people believe that.  <br/>\nOthers believe other things.&quot;  You don&#39;t need to explain everything right <br/>\nnow.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to look at it a different way, a lot of what I wrote this morning was coming from a place of remembering my childhood experances at the hands of my mothers religion. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been talking today about other belife systems and reading stories. Jaiden has found it interesting, but he keeps asking why grammy said I would lie to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;At Easter you could tell him what Easter&#39;s about (bunny bits and crucifix <br/>\nbits both) and he&#39;ll build his own model of the history of religion in his <br/>\nown head, gradually.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been doing this, I love &quot;holidays&quot; and have a nice collection of folk tales from different regions and we read them, and talk about them. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;He can&#39;t really have choice without information.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, I just wanted the information to be unbiased and honest, not Jesus is a flying, cape wareing super hero the likes of superman. Thats not honest.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t be mad at the grandmother unless she told him you&#39;re going to hell <br/>\nto burn in eternal pits of brimstone forever.  That might really torque me.  <br/>\nBut if she was more vague and bright about it, I&#39;d let it go.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know, she didn&#39;t tell him about burning in hell, but she did tell him that I would lie to him and she would tell him the truth. <br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

We both have different views - he&#39;s athiest, with <br/>\neastern/toaist leanings, I&#39;m pagan, but still seeking. We both come <br/>\nfrom very diverse families - his family are southern baptist one one <br/>\nside and head up and run the morman church here in S.D. on the other, <br/>\nbut his parents are wiccan. My family, my mome is christian, stepdad <br/>\nraised jewish(doesn&#39;t parctice), my dad is a follower of native <br/>\namerican spirituality and a memeber of the native american church, <br/>\nand my step mom is lutherian.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Jason and I talked and talked about how to prestent our beliefs <br/>\nto our kids. We both decided that we would wait, having both had <br/>\nreligion forced down out throats - Jason, christianity and paganism, <br/>\nand me, chrisianity. We wanted our kids to have an option that we as <br/>\nchildren didn&#39;t have. To choose for them selves. We decided that when <br/>\nthey were ready, meaning when they came to use with questions, we <br/>\nwould start talking and exploreing ideas and relgions frm all over <br/>\nand give them the information to choose on their own what the wanted <br/>\nto belive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe figured the questions would start when they were about 6-7, but <br/>\nwere prepared for them at any time. So last night...<br/>\n<br/>\nJaiden started telling us all about Jesus, we asked him where he had <br/>\nheard about Jesus. He told us that gramy(my mom) had been telling him <br/>\nall about him, how he was like a saver, and a super hero...needless <br/>\nto say, Jason jumped on the phone and had a long talk with her. She <br/>\nsaid that she wouldn&#39;t do it again. We asked if Jaiden had been <br/>\nasking questions, and she said no, but that she had felt that it was <br/>\nher duty to make sure he knew all about god, that way he would be <br/>\nprotected against our beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t know what to do, i feel like what I wanted for my kids, <br/>\nfree choice, is gone. I feel like I have damamge to undo that I had <br/>\nnever planned on. All the grandparents knew where we stood on <br/>\nreligion and belief and we had no problem with them sharing there <br/>\nbelifes with the kids, as long as it was honest and sought after. And <br/>\nwe wanted to be there, if the kids were very young.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m just not really sure where to go from here. Do I let it lie, <br/>\nand wait for Jaiden to come to us, do I start introducing other <br/>\nbelife systems. I&#39;m feeling very lost at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to anyone who made it to the end of this. Any ideas would <br/>\nbe helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

We both have different views - he&#39;s athiest, with <br/>\neastern/toaist leanings, I&#39;m pagan, but still seeking. We both come <br/>\nfrom very diverse families - his family are southern baptist one one <br/>\nside and head up and run the morman church here in S.D. on the other, <br/>\nbut his parents are wiccan. My family, my mome is christian, stepdad <br/>\nraised jewish(doesn&#39;t parctice), my dad is a follower of native <br/>\namerican spirituality and a memeber of the native american church, <br/>\nand my step mom is lutherian.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Jason and I talked and talked about how to prestent our beliefs <br/>\nto our kids. We both decided that we would wait, having both had <br/>\nreligion forced down out throats - Jason, christianity and paganism, <br/>\nand me, chrisianity. We wanted our kids to have an option that we as <br/>\nchildren didn&#39;t have. To choose for them selves. We decided that when <br/>\nthey were ready, meaning when they came to use with questions, we <br/>\nwould start talking and exploreing ideas and relgions frm all over <br/>\nand give them the information to choose on their own what the wanted <br/>\nto belive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe figured the questions would start when they were about 6-7, but <br/>\nwere prepared for them at any time. So last night...<br/>\n<br/>\nJaiden started telling us all about Jesus, we asked him where he had <br/>\nheard about Jesus. He told us that gramy(my mom) had been telling him <br/>\nall about him, how he was like a saver, and a super hero...needless <br/>\nto say, Jason jumped on the phone and had a long talk with her. She <br/>\nsaid that she wouldn&#39;t do it again. We asked if Jaiden had been <br/>\nasking questions, and she said no, but that she had felt that it was <br/>\nher duty to make sure he knew all about god, that way he would be <br/>\nprotected against our beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t know what to do, i feel like what I wanted for my kids, <br/>\nfree choice, is gone. I feel like I have damamge to undo that I had <br/>\nnever planned on. All the grandparents knew where we stood on <br/>\nreligion and belief and we had no problem with them sharing there <br/>\nbelifes with the kids, as long as it was honest and sought after.

Kids get input from lots of different sources on lots of <br/>\ndifferent topics. It&#39;s okay to calmly mention that &quot;superhero Jesus&quot; <br/>\nis what Grandma believes in and isn&#39;t that great for her. Lots of <br/>\npeople have different beliefs.

We both have different views - he&#39;s athiest, with <br/>\neastern/toaist leanings, I&#39;m pagan, but still seeking. We both come <br/>\nfrom very diverse families - his family are southern baptist one one <br/>\nside and head up and run the morman church here in S.D. on the other, <br/>\nbut his parents are wiccan. My family, my mome is christian, stepdad <br/>\nraised jewish(doesn&#39;t parctice), my dad is a follower of native <br/>\namerican spirituality and a memeber of the native american church, <br/>\nand my step mom is lutherian.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Jason and I talked and talked about how to prestent our beliefs <br/>\nto our kids. We both decided that we would wait, having both had <br/>\nreligion forced down out throats - Jason, christianity and paganism, <br/>\nand me, chrisianity. We wanted our kids to have an option that we as <br/>\nchildren didn&#39;t have. To choose for them selves. We decided that when <br/>\nthey were ready, meaning when they came to use with questions, we <br/>\nwould start talking and exploreing ideas and relgions frm all over <br/>\nand give them the information to choose on their own what the wanted <br/>\nto belive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe figured the questions would start when they were about 6-7, but <br/>\nwere prepared for them at any time. So last night...<br/>\n<br/>\nJaiden started telling us all about Jesus, we asked him where he had <br/>\nheard about Jesus. He told us that gramy(my mom) had been telling him <br/>\nall about him, how he was like a saver, and a super hero...needless <br/>\nto say, Jason jumped on the phone and had a long talk with her. She <br/>\nsaid that she wouldn&#39;t do it again. We asked if Jaiden had been <br/>\nasking questions, and she said no, but that she had felt that it was <br/>\nher duty to make sure he knew all about god, that way he would be <br/>\nprotected against our beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t know what to do, i feel like what I wanted for my kids, <br/>\nfree choice, is gone. I feel like I have damamge to undo that I had <br/>\nnever planned on.
