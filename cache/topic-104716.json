Have nutritious food on hand. Make <br/>\nnutritious choices for yourself. When a question comes up tell her why <br/>\nyou&#39;re making a particular choice for yourself. But let her make her <br/>\nown choices. If she wants a specific something from the store, put it <br/>\non the list. if she wants to try some new fun snacky food, get it for <br/>\nher. She will learn far more about the world by having the freedom to <br/>\nexperiment than she will by memorizing what you say is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we say &quot;This is what I believe,&quot; it gives us room to be wrong.

You <br/>\ndon&#39;t just let them run. You find ways that will help them hold your <br/>\nhand or  hold onto something. Promising a trip to the park soon so they <br/>\nhave a safe place to run.

That is a lot of <br/>\n&gt; cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what we do, and it seems to be working well, but I&#39;ll add the <br/>\ncaveat that my kids are still very young (almost 5 and 2), so I may <br/>\nhave to rethink things as they get older.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, we plan our dinner menus as a family -- it only takes <br/>\nabout 15 minutes once a week.  I print out a menu form I made on the <br/>\ncomputer which also has a section to write what I&#39;ll need from the <br/>\ngrocery store.  Then dh and I sit with the kids and everyone offers <br/>\nsuggestions as to what they&#39;d like.  It&#39;s easy and fun, and then when <br/>\nthe meals are being served, the kids get a kick out of eating from the <br/>\nmenus they&#39;ve helped to create.  It really helps me because while I <br/>\nlove to cook, I sometimes get in a rut or just feel stumped when it <br/>\ncomes to thinking of what to make.  Also at this time, everyone makes <br/>\ntheir requests for the week&#39;s groceries.  It makes shopping easier for <br/>\nme, because I&#39;m not guessing what people might want, and we have a lot <br/>\nless waste, because all items are either wanted or planned for in the <br/>\nmenu.<br/>\n<br/>\nDinner goes really smoothly for us because I don&#39;t make stuff my kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t like (dh and I will be really happy when their tastes grow to <br/>\ninclude more casseroles and spicier dishes, though, LOL), and if there <br/>\nis something on the menu that one person doesn&#39;t like, I know in <br/>\nadvance to make an alternative, so it doesn&#39;t seem like a pain at the <br/>\ntime.  For example, dd1 doesn&#39;t like anything mixed together -- she <br/>\nused to, but doesn&#39;t right now -- so when everyone else is having beef <br/>\nstew, I either saute her meat and steam her vegetables separately <br/>\n(which only takes a few minutes), or I make her a hot dog or some <br/>\ncanned soup and she eats some veggies from the salad.  The kids are <br/>\nalways happy to came to the table because they know they will not be <br/>\npressured to eat anything -- even if it is their favorite, they always <br/>\nhave the option of saying &quot;No thanks.&quot;  They are very willing to try <br/>\nnew things, because they have never been forced to eat something they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like.  They are free to leave the table whenever they please, <br/>\nbut usually they stick around because we are enjoying each others&#39; <br/>\ncompany and their dad has been away at work all day, and they want to <br/>\nbe where he is.  Now, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a Martha Stewart experience, <br/>\nwith perfectly groomed little angels eating with perfect manners!  Dd2 <br/>\nusually prefers to stand on her chair while eating, Dd1squirts ketchup <br/>\noff her plate onto the table more times than not, but our priority is <br/>\nhaving it be an experience they enjoy and look forward to, not a table <br/>\nmanners critiquing session ;-).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as food issues for the rest of the day, pretty much I just make <br/>\nthem what they want when they want it.  They are both extremely healthy <br/>\nkids -- never been to the doctor for any reason other than routine <br/>\ncheck-ups.  Both are in the 75th percentile for weight, and the 95th <br/>\nfor height.  They are bright, active, and happy.  I have a candy jar <br/>\nfilled with their favorites, and sometimes weeks will go by without <br/>\nthem paying it any attention whatsoever.  When they do want some, they <br/>\nserve themselves, and they always take about 3 or 4 pieces each, which <br/>\nI think is reasonable.  Sometimes they get on a kick, started by one <br/>\nand imitated by the other, where they want ice cream for breakfast <br/>\nevery day for a week or so -- so I give it to them, and then it fades <br/>\naway for a few months.  They like the typical kids&#39; foods: hot dogs, <br/>\nmac/cheese, grilled cheese, spaghetti; but they also love my homemade <br/>\nminestrone, spinach pie, tabbouli, humus, and they eat any separately <br/>\ncooked meat or seafood, plus veggies, and then a rice, potato or pasta <br/>\nside for dinner that I make.  They are not big breakfast eaters, once <br/>\nin a while dd2 will have a scrambled egg.  Their favorite for lunch is <br/>\nfor me to make them a plate with a bunch of different foods on it -- <br/>\ncheese cubes or slices, some sliced meat, little pickles, garbanzo <br/>\nbeans, olives, cukes or tomatoes, some grapes or other fresh fruit, and <br/>\nmaybe a cookie.  During the day, they snack on whatever we have <br/>\navailable -- and here I will admit to stacking the deck pretty severely <br/>\n(which I admit I may not be able to continue to do when they are older) <br/>\n-- I do not buy processed foods like ChipsAhoy cookies, or even the <br/>\norganic ones.  I bake all of our bread, make all of our cookies, cakes, <br/>\netc. from good quality, whole grain (where possible) ingredients.  The <br/>\nkids like to bake so much that we do it at least twice a week, so we <br/>\nreally have no need for store-bought cookies, etc.  I always keep lots <br/>\nof fruit and veggies that I know they like in the fridge -- my kids <br/>\nwould rather eat raw green beans than potato chips any day,  but, if we <br/>\nhappen to have chips, I don&#39;t restrict them.  They also, for some <br/>\nreason, love frozen corn and frozen peas.  Oh, and of course, frozen <br/>\nblueberries are a staple for us.  For the stuff that still gives me the <br/>\nwillies (hot dogs and mac and cheese from a box), I buy the best <br/>\nquality I can find (the natural casing hot dogs from the deli, and <br/>\nAnnie&#39;s organic mac and cheese) and just let go whatever reservations I <br/>\nmay have about them -- I feel so good about the rest of their diet, I <br/>\ncan afford to relax about some stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this got so long, hope it was helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nJackie Chovanes<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchovanes@...\">jchovanes@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling Discussion] Intro and Food Choices","postDate":"1111510308","msgId":104736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2LjZmMDhiODc5LjJmNzFhNzI0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":104733,"nextInTopic":104742,"prevInTime":104735,"nextInTime":104737,"topicId":104716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/22/05 9:28:24 AM, debra.rossing@mastercam.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-76349733\">In a message dated 3/22/05 9:28:24 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Talk <br/>\n<br/>\nabout how they feel after 102 cookies, 17 Cokes and nothing else for <br/>\n<br/>\na day or two &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nExaggerations like that just reinforce the idea that anyone WOULD eat nothing <br/>\nbut cookies and coke for a day or two, but it never ever happens.

Not everyone sits down at<br/>\ntable all together every evening. Many Unschoolers apply respecting family<br/>\nmembers&#39; freedom of choice to this practice also.

Talk <br/>\nabout how they feel after 102 cookies, 17 Cokes and nothing else for <br/>\na day or two (quantities wildly exaggerated to make the point). For <br/>\nexample, DS is almost 7. I noticed that if he didn&#39;t get some <br/>\nprotein in regularly, he&#39;d be more easily frustrated and generally <br/>\nuncomfortable inside his own skin. I mentioned to him one day, when <br/>\nthings were heading in the same direction yet again (but after my <br/>\nconnecting A to B), &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve noticed you get really frustrated <br/>\nwhen you haven&#39;t had some protein. How about I make you a PBJ?&quot; And <br/>\noff we headed to the kitchen - don&#39;t remember whether he had that or <br/>\nif I got him some cheese and crackers or what. Point is, I had some <br/>\ninfo that would be useful to him and gave it to him. Now we have a <br/>\nlist of protein foods on our kitchen wall chalkboard so he has easy <br/>\nreference when he wants something. In similar vein, DH is <br/>\nhypertensive, so checking sodium quantities and such in foods is <br/>\nsomething we do. DS has been known to check a label and say &quot;Daddy, <br/>\nthis has too much sodium in it for us&quot; He has also used label info <br/>\nto decide that one type of soda is a better choice than another, if <br/>\nwe&#39;re buying soda at that point. And, sometimes, he chooses <br/>\nregardless. Over all, though, he has a very well balanced eating <br/>\npattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternate meals? We keep simple stuff handy - PBJ is easy <br/>\n(especially for kids old enough to handle a spoon to spread with), <br/>\ncheese and crackers (a wire cheese slicer is safe for kids to use), <br/>\ncooked pasta than can be easily re-heated (or eaten cold as DS will <br/>\nsometimes do), pre-sliced, ready to eat fruits and veggies in the <br/>\nfridge, etc. We also do lots of mix n match meals - pasta, sauce, <br/>\nmeatballs, cheeses, all separate to build as each chooses; flour <br/>\ntortillas, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, beans/chili, salsa, sour cream <br/>\nall separate so each person can build a burriot, taco, wrap to their <br/>\nliking (sometimes DS simply wants a pile of cheese with some diced <br/>\ntomato on a tortilla wrap-style); rice, stir fried or otherwise <br/>\ncooked veggies, meat if any for custom stir fry meals, and so on. <br/>\nWe&#39;ll also put out the salad/fresh veggies out ahead of time for DS <br/>\nto munch while the rest of dinner is on. Sure, he may fill up on <br/>\ncarrots and tomatoes (the little easy to manage kind) and cucumbers <br/>\nand cheese and bell peppers and eat little dinner but hey, I&#39;m not <br/>\ncomplaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve been limiting/controlling food, go slowly releasing the <br/>\ncontrols. Say yes more but to simply &quot;let loose the hounds&quot; is going <br/>\nto probably cause you more stress and confuse the kids - which is <br/>\nlikely to result in a rebound effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nGive the kids say in the grocery shopping - DS shops with me (handy <br/>\nfor getting stuff off low shelves!). They have the usual assortment <br/>\nof snack cakes right at the front of the bread and PB aisle. I <br/>\nstopped there and asked if he wanted anything. He said Not here, <br/>\nwhere&#39;s the cottage cheese? We also talk, not only about nutrition, <br/>\nbut about money - we can afford this OR that this week. Which would <br/>\nyou prefer? We can put the other on the next list (and we do - that <br/>\npart is important). He knows he has free range (within budget) to <br/>\nchoose items and help me choose within some categories (which jams <br/>\nshould we get?) For a time, he was just in love with a particular <br/>\nsnack cake. We&#39;d buy one pack per week (snack cakes really run up <br/>\nthe grocery bill). Then, that exact item went on sale 5 for $5. So <br/>\nwe stopped at that spot and I told DS go get FIVE of those. He was <br/>\nbeyond belief happy. If it wasn&#39;t for me brown bagging them and DH <br/>\neating them too, the last couple of boxes would never have been <br/>\ntouched. My point being, DS knows he can have them when he wants <br/>\npretty much, so he doesn&#39;t need to have them all the time. There&#39;s <br/>\nno sense of neediness or the &quot;famine&quot; mentality associated with ANY <br/>\nfoods for him - he&#39;ll eat bell pepper slices as readily as an Oreo, <br/>\nif bell pepper slices are what he&#39;s wanting right then. He&#39;s been <br/>\nknown to eat an entire canteloupe over the course of a day. <br/>\nWaitresses get a kick out of him ordering just a salad and iced tea <br/>\nat restaurants, or making sure we order him a spinach dip for <br/>\nhimself (often that&#39;s his whole meal, eaten with a fork, he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike the tortilla chips - some places now do an &quot;Atkins&quot; spinach dip <br/>\nplatter with fresh veggies that he really likes), or getting &quot;just <br/>\nthe salad bar&quot; at some places - and eating a good full plate of <br/>\nveggies, cheese, diced eggs and ham, and fruit. He dislikes places <br/>\nthat only have iceberg lettuce in their salads - it has no flavor. <br/>\nHe&#39;s never been limited deliberately by us - economics, yes; us, no. <br/>\nAnd we get interesting comments from folks when they see him eating <br/>\nfresh veggies, vegan chili, fruit, etc. along with cake or cookies <br/>\nor whatever. &quot;How did you &#39;get&#39; him to do that?&quot; Simple, we didn&#39;t. <br/>\nWe just never crimped his internal guidance system.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa - running on here.

I have been lurking for over a month now and I have found the list to be very stimulating.  Before I bring up what I want to talk about I will give you a little background information about me and my family.<br/>\n <br/>\nDh and I will be married for 14 years this May.  We have two ds, Charles (12) and Julian (9), and dd Willow (5) and also a dd on the way (due June 1).  Our children have never been to school.  We have never done &#39;school at home&#39; either, but I have played around with various levels of structure especially in the early years.  However, I kept coming back to the conclusion, the less structure the better.  My real stumbling blocks (in regards to working toward the kind of ideal environment I envisioned) have been computer/video game/TV.  I had a big hang up about those.  After much internal debate, discussions with dh, and going to an unschooler friendly conference, I was right on the edge of letting go completely.  Reading the discussions on this list pushed me over the edge (in a good way).<br/>\n <br/>\nWhile reading the list I also came across references to letting children have complete control over what and when they eat.  Wow.  Scary, yet intriguing.  So I have been thinking about it a lot, and talking to dh, and I read the stuff from Sandra&#39;s site.  I understand the principle, and it certainly makes sense.  So we have been trying it.  But (isn&#39;t there always a big but hanging around?), the practical application of this idea is not simple for me.  I am full of questions and squirming doubts and frustration.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems to me that the principle of giving children control of food is not about expecting them to eventually start eating on their own the way you would choose for them.  Right?  Rather, it is about trusting them and accepting their choices whatever they are.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have some very strong opinions about what is good food and bad food.  I have researched nutrition and drawn on my own experiences to reach these opinions.  Surely I shouldn&#39;t just ignore this background and smile cheerfully when my dd reaches for cookie number six?  Yet I don&#39;t want to nag her or make her feel guilty.  And what about shopping?  How do I decide what to buy?  And then there is supper.  If the kids don&#39;t want to eat what I have planned do I cook them something else?  Something different for each child?  That is a lot of cooking.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I would like some examples of how this works in different families.  Either I need to commit to this idea whole heartedly and work through my issues or I need to go back to my old comfortable ways (geez that sounds unenlightened!).<br/>\n <br/>\nTIA,<br/>\nCaprice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104905,"nextTopicId":104942}}
