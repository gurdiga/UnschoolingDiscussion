A <br/>\ndifferent review from either of these said the historical  section should&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen longer, which I took to mean the historical section was  good so I&#39;m <br/>\nordering it.  But I thought of this list when I read this first  bit, and I&#39;ve <br/>\nincluded the negative comment so people won&#39;t buy it just because  of the first <br/>\ngood review.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe book is The Compleat Gentleman: The Modern Man&#39;s Guide to Chivalry, by  <br/>\nBrad Miner.  (I&#39;m getting it from Quality Paperback, for a friend of  mine.)<br/>\n <br/>\n==============too much buildup, but here comes the good  part:==============<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMr. Miner does not take the &quot;Etiquette&quot; by Emily Post approach to the  <br/>\nsubject. A gentleman does not follow a checklist of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. No  checklist <br/>\ncan address every circumstance in which the gentleman may find  himself. <br/>\n <br/>\nRather, the author attempts to show the aspiring gentleman how he should  <br/>\nthink, for if a man understands the principles that inform gentlemanly behavior,  <br/>\nhe will need no checklist. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\nReading this book was as interesting as reading the  geneologies listed in <br/>\nthe Bible. Every now and then a good nugget of information  would appear, then <br/>\nback to the begatting. Being much more history than a guide,  the recent grad <br/>\nwill have dropped this book long before the necessity of its  contents could be <br/>\nappreciated. I was looking for situational based advice and  lessons from <br/>\nanother voice and found this source lacking.<br/>\n<br/>\n=================================<br/>\n <br/>\nAHA! (oh, this is Sandra again)<br/>\n <br/>\nI just noticed the complainant DID miss the point, and is complaining  that <br/>\nthe book didn&#39;t give &quot;situational based advice.&quot;  The advice to become  a good <br/>\nguy and develop some principles wasn&#39;t good advice for him.  &lt;g&gt;  (Maybe.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t read it.)<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102505,"nextTopicId":102565}}
