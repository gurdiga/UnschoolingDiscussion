So far, I have had 3 teenagers, 2 of which have passed the age of<br/>\n16, and all have had those traits. My oldest 2 were public schooled all the<br/>\nway through graduation, and displayed those traits quite a bit still at the<br/>\nage of 16. They are both much better now. Child number three is almost 14<br/>\nand wants us to kick him out of the house so he can have an excuse to live<br/>\non his own! He has been homeschooled fulltime since the second quarter of<br/>\n7th grade. Before that, part time from the last quarter of 6th grade. My<br/>\nyoungest ds, now 11, has been homeschooled fulltime since the last quarter<br/>\nof 3rd grade. In many ways he is much more mature than the others were at<br/>\nhis age; in other ways he is more immature. So, each child is different.<br/>\nBut there are usually many similarities among children of the same age<br/>\nrange.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36845,"nextTopicId":36862}}
