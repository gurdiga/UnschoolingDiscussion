Every moment in life offers<br/>\n  opportunities for learning and investigation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We went to the Rose Parade and my 12 yo daughter wondered aloud why it<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t smell like roses even when you&#39;re right up close to the floats.<br/>\n  There was a great opportunity to talk about plants being grown for<br/>\n  various purposes - and how that is done - tomatoes raised for<br/>\n  transportability rather than taste, flowers for longlastingness rather<br/>\n  than aroma.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling families live in a learning world - no division<br/>\n  of life into school time and not-school time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We had an earthquake here last week (California) and we spent<br/>\n  considerable time watching the news about it and reading and<br/>\n  understanding what causes earthquakes and how their magnitude is<br/>\n  measured and also how buildings are constructed to be more safe in<br/>\n  earthquakes. Then the earthquake in Bam, Iran, struck. It was the same<br/>\n  magnitude as the one we&#39;d just experienced. My husband is Iranian, so<br/>\n  this adds to our focused interest there. We read about Bam itself, a<br/>\n  city whose buildings were thousands of years old and absolutely<br/>\n  gorgeous - all gone now. We found a website with fantastic pictures of<br/>\n  it taken just a few months ago. This whole last week we&#39;ve been<br/>\n  immersed in ancient history, geography, geology, and architecture. We<br/>\n  wanted to make a donation to the Red Cross for helping the people of<br/>\n  Bam, and that brought up the question of why there is the Red Crescent<br/>\n  in Iran, not a Red Cross. A little cultural geography thrown into the<br/>\n  mix. We also, by chance, watched a movie, called &quot;Cup Final,&quot; the other<br/>\n  night, which was about an Israeli soldier being held captive by a PLO<br/>\n  guerrilla group. Again, that tied in with us spending time talking<br/>\n  about the middle east and religions there and the long history.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschoolers do not preplan a curriculum and we don&#39;t have predetermined<br/>\n  lesson plans. What we have instead is an extremely rich environment for<br/>\n  learning in which, for example, the globe sits on the living room<br/>\n  coffee table and is regularly handled and part of our everyday life<br/>\n  (not pulled out for a specific lesson). Learning is valued and<br/>\n  constant. Connections are looked for everywhere and the whole family is<br/>\n  involved and loves to explore ideas and gain new information and<br/>\n  knowledge. Learning happens inside the learner&#39;s own head and is not<br/>\n  always apparent to outside observers, but the proof, for me, is in the<br/>\n  pudding &lt;G&gt;. My kids think learning is what life is for. And I agree <br/>\n  with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -pam<br/>\n  National Home Education Network<br/>\n  &lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\n  Serving the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\n  through information, networking and public relations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Yahoo!

The fatal flaw in this is that interest in a given<br/>\n &gt; subject (for children and adults<br/>\n &gt; alike) does not arise out of nothing. We only discover our interest in<br/>\n &gt; a given subject (or decide we are<br/>\n &gt; distinctly not interested) as we are exposed and immersed in it to a<br/>\n &gt; greater or lesser extent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I responded:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not leaving kids to their own devices until they show an<br/>\ninterest in learning a given subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers do not expect interests to arise out of nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an unschooling parent I offer ideas,<br/>\ninformation, activities, starting points, and material to my<br/>\nchildren as opportune moments arise, not out of nothing, but out of the<br/>\nexperiences that are created by mindful living in the world - walking<br/>\nin the woods, visiting museums, watching movies, reading books, going<br/>\nto the theater, swimming in the ocean.

Then the earthquake in Bam, Iran, struck. It was the same<br/>\nmagnitude as the one we&#39;d just experienced. My husband is Iranian, so<br/>\nthis adds to our focused interest there. We read about Bam itself, a<br/>\ncity whose buildings were thousands of years old and absolutely<br/>\ngorgeous - all gone now. We found a website with fantastic pictures of<br/>\nit taken just a few months ago. This whole last week we&#39;ve been<br/>\nimmersed in ancient history, geography, geology, and architecture. We<br/>\nwanted to make a donation to the Red Cross for helping the people of<br/>\nBam, and that brought up the question of why there is the Red Crescent<br/>\nin Iran, not a Red Cross. A little cultural geography thrown into the<br/>\nmix. We also, by chance, watched a movie, called &quot;Cup Final,&quot; the other<br/>\nnight, which was about an Israeli soldier being held captive by a PLO<br/>\nguerrilla group. Again, that tied in with us spending time talking<br/>\nabout the middle east and religions there and the long history.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers do not preplan a curriculum and we don&#39;t have predetermined<br/>\nlesson plans.
