It was <br/>\nquite interesting actually and gave me a lot of time to catch up on my <br/>\nreading... Steve took the day off work and become househubbie and SAHD for <br/>\nthe day and he and both kids loved it.  Zak still had his playdate and that <br/>\nwas even more exciting for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there I read &quot;Deschooling our Lives&quot; edited by Matt Hern... I was <br/>\ntempted to turn the cover back so no one could see the title but instead held <br/>\nopen the book proudly.  The man sitting next to me asked if it was some sort <br/>\nof new school that was starting in Tucson.  Where to begin explaining.  I <br/>\nsaid &quot;no it&#39;s about a form of homeschooling&quot;  He said &quot;oh my sister <br/>\nhomeschools her kids, they love it and seem to be doing great&quot; so we then got <br/>\ninto this conversation about the difference between homeschooling and <br/>\nunschooling.  What a pleasure it was...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure many of you have read this book (if not all)... I just loved it and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even get to start reading &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; again as planned.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to have a bath with the kids as they seem to not miss me at the moment <br/>\nand I&#39;d like my presense felt!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10962,"nextTopicId":10915}}
