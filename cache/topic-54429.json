We <br/>\nreally don&#39;t have to. We chose to or not. Kids don&#39;t have to do chores <br/>\nunless their parents make them. They would chose not to unless they learn at <br/>\nan age comfortable for them why people do chose to do them that have a <br/>\nchoice. Then I belive they would make the choice to do what feels right for <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never had to do chores and I am now a very neat and organized person. When <br/>\nI was first away from home at school, I saw tons of girls that were complete <br/>\nslobs. Most of them complained that they had so many chores at home, they <br/>\nwre taking advantage of not having to do any now. Now I doubt very much that <br/>\nmost of those girls had &quot;tons&quot; of chores, but for them it probably seemed <br/>\nthat way as they had no choice. Makes you wonder what happens to those <br/>\npeople when no one is around to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for some parents who say they don&#39;t care after their children move away <br/>\nwhat they do with their own homes, I would think they should care. I care <br/>\nabout what my kids choices are when they leave this house. I may not have <br/>\nany say so in it, but I still care and want them to be responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of goes along with not being exposed to certain things as children and <br/>\nthen going wild later on. I was never exposed to swearing or nudity at all. <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t wait to say fuck when I got older and wasn&#39;t afraid of getting <br/>\ncaught. Just to see what would happen. Went crazy with naked bodies and <br/>\nflashed quite a few people myself let alone what my social life was like. <br/>\nYou know the whole theory about the good small town catholic schooled girl <br/>\nthat goes nuts in the big city? I know a lot of it has to do with other <br/>\nfactors, but I do believe it for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
