Unschooling is learning fulltime","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-238733662\">-=-=-=-Unschooling isn&#39;t just learning without being taught.<br/>\nUnschooling is  learning without being taught *full time*.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nUnschooling is learning fulltime without being taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to suggest that clarification because if our definition is being  nit-picked, I don&#39;t want someone to say &quot;I&#39;m not teaching full time, just part  time, so I&#39;m unschooling; Joyce said so.&quot;-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, hell! And *I* want to clarify further to say that teaching *can* take place in unschooling...BUT, if the learner has no interest, then learning isn&#39;t happening. OR the lesson being learned isn&#39;t necessarily the lesson being taught! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want someone to say, &quot;He CAN&#39;T take piano lessons because he CAN&#39;T be taught. That&#39;s not unschooling; Sandra said so!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching *can* happen in unschooling---but NOT without the learning that would accompany it. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching for teaching&#39;s sake is NOT unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuddier? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104586,"nextTopicId":259}}
