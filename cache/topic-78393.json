I try to<br/>\nget more than one thing done when we go - Rain might have a dance  class,<br/>\nthen a rehearsal, then we&#39;d stop and visit some friends. If you did the<br/>\nsign class, maybe you could look into other things to do, and maybe if<br/>\nshe started meeting some kids there you could set up visiting times after<br/>\nor before the class. Lots of groups here have park days, which are free,<br/>\nand there are parks and rec classes pretty cheap, and most places offer<br/>\nscholarships, and there&#39;s also stuff like hanging at the bead shop or the<br/>\ncoffee shop or the pool...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in kind of the same boat with book sales, except they&#39;re not as<br/>\nfrequent and they don&#39;t last as long. Still, it&#39;s easier if Rain comes<br/>\nbecause she can help carry books, and guard my books, and pick valuable<br/>\nbooks herself. It&#39;s sort of a give and take, and sometimes one of us has<br/>\nto miss something, and other times she spends the night with a friend who<br/>\ntakes her to her thing the next day. It *really* helps to have a network<br/>\nof friends, from a purely logistical POV, especially as a single parent.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how I&#39;d make things work otherwise, because Rain likes to do<br/>\nlots of things, and I&#39;m only one person. I am really grateful for having<br/>\nthem, but you do kind of have to get involved first and the friends come<br/>\nlater, most of the time. I do try to me available to reciprocate, too, by<br/>\ndriving other kids home from stuff and taking care of pets when people go<br/>\non trips, but if one was keeping track, I probably get more than I give.<br/>\nLuckily no one really keeps track...<br/>\n<br/>\nWould there be a way to compromise on the BBQ - powwow thing?
