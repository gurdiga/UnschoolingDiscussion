I&#39;ve been exactly where you are and I know how<br/>\ncrummy you feel.  I have 5 kids and a tremendous number of animals.  I have<br/>\na husband who used to want to control everything and seemed angry at us all<br/>\nthe time because somebody left the bikes out in the rain AGAIN, somebody<br/>\ncolored on the wall AGAIN, somebody broke a plate AGAIN, the dog pooped in<br/>\nthe garage AGAIN.  I felt like I had this standard that we needed to live up<br/>\nto and I kept trying to make the kids live up to it.  I wanted the Cleavers<br/>\nand I kept ending up with the Ozbournes.  We were all unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided to make some changes.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI told dh to get over it.  We have 5 kids, the house will not STAY clean,<br/>\nthings start to break down as soon as they are built because it is how the<br/>\nworld works, don&#39;t be mad at us because we are just being who we are. Get<br/>\nover it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I went back to a lesson from Gandhi that is the most amazing, yet<br/>\nsimple thing.......He said to be the change you want to see in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want my home to be calmer, then I must be calmer.  If I take my &quot;angst&quot;<br/>\nout of our home, it is calmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want people in my family to be nicer to each other then I have to be<br/>\nnicer.  If I take my meanness out of our home, then the family is being<br/>\nnicer than they were with my meanness.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the amazing thing is the ripple effect.  The kids are calmer, nicer.  Dh<br/>\nhas been amazing.  I think it was a wakeup call for him as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings aren&#39;t perfect here.  But they are much, much calmer and nicer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81087,"nextTopicId":82774}}
