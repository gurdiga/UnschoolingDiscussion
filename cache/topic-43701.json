Autistic, special needs or<br/>\nCP. I had a<br/>\n| fellow homeschooler come over to our house for a day of play<br/>\nand swimming.<br/>\n| She has a 6year old daughter that my daughter was thrilled to<br/>\nmeet. Most her<br/>\n| age are boys in our group. I hadn&#39;t remembered this child but<br/>\nfor once at a<br/>\n| park when she was 4. At that time I did notice she was happier<br/>\nto be alone<br/>\n| but when the mother said she was immature for age, I never<br/>\nthought twice<br/>\n| about it. She just seemed like she wasn&#39;t into playing with<br/>\nother kids at<br/>\n| that time.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Well as soon as the mother and daughter walked into my house, I<br/>\nknew there<br/>\n| was something different. At the end of our play day, the mother<br/>\nand daughter<br/>\n| had fun, I was uncomfortable and my kids really didn&#39;t seem<br/>\ndifferent aside<br/>\n| from the fact that they had no one to play with when they<br/>\nthought they were<br/>\n| going to. The child to me, as far as the info I have which<br/>\nisn&#39;t much, seems<br/>\n| slightly autistic. She doesn&#39;t interact at all with anyone. She<br/>\ntalks but<br/>\n| not to anyone, not the kids or me or even her mom. She never<br/>\nmakes eye<br/>\n| contact and just goes very quickly from one thing to another<br/>\nlike no one<br/>\n| else is around. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because her<br/>\nmother doesn&#39;t<br/>\n| really watch her as if there is a problem. (my mother has a<br/>\nconnecting MIL<br/>\n| quarters to our house and this little girl just walked right in<br/>\nnever saying<br/>\n| a word and went into my mother&#39;s bedroom for awhile and then<br/>\njust left) I<br/>\n| found this out later. I&#39;ve never had any child, whether<br/>\nschoooled or not go<br/>\n| through my house like that. So I had to watch her and make<br/>\ncomments when she<br/>\n| did what we don&#39;t do here in the house. Like push people and<br/>\ngrab things<br/>\n| from others and so on.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| My kids tried to play with her but it just wasn&#39;t possible.<br/>\nThey had nothing<br/>\n| to say other than she seemed to not like them. The mother gives<br/>\nno<br/>\n| indication at all that she sees a problem. She just says being<br/>\nan only<br/>\n| child, that the girl is immature. Now the only autistic<br/>\nchildren I know go<br/>\n| to special classes daily. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the best thing<br/>\nor not but I<br/>\n| can&#39;t help but wonder that maybe this child could benefit from<br/>\nsome other<br/>\n| type of help the mother isn&#39;t giving. The mother unschools in<br/>\nas far as I<br/>\n| know of, only not having work to do. I know nothing else of how<br/>\nshe is with<br/>\n| the child.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Do I say something to this mother? She frequently calls me for<br/>\nadvice and<br/>\n| marvles at how I do it with 4 kids and thanks me greatly for<br/>\nsuggestions I<br/>\n| have made that help her. Now I see things differently and<br/>\nrealize why she<br/>\n| seems to need help with things. Not usre if it&#39;s for me to say<br/>\nsomething or<br/>\n| what I would exactly say.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Mary B<br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n| Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a><br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n| ------------------------ Yahoo!
