It&#39;s not worth much. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a quote fom a paper by a professor of Journalism, about linguisting <br/>\nintelligence.  Sorry it&#39;s in academic-speech, but there are some good bits:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-A well-developed linguistic intelligence shows itself in attention to <br/>\nwords, overtones of words, relations among them, syntax, and the beauty and <br/>\nsubstance of style. It is the most obvious element in what we mean by &quot;good <br/>\nwriting.&quot; Poets show how experts use this intelligence (Gardner discusses Eliot, <br/>\nSpender, and others) but it is also present in word play, puns, and even crossword <br/>\npuzzles. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Language, the chief product of linguistic intelligence, is surprisingly <br/>\nflexible. The deaf can learn language, and people can learn to read language <br/>\nthrough totally different symbol-processing systems --through a sound-oriented <br/>\nsystem of syllables (like our alphabet) or through a visually-oriented system of <br/>\nideograms (like Chinese symbols). Studies indicate that syllables and <br/>\nideograms are processed in entirely different areas of the brain, yet the linguistic <br/>\nintelligence can successfully make use of either method of encoding. It is <br/>\ncharacteristic of an intelligence, in Gardner&#39;s view, to appropriate whatever facu<br/>\nlties or senses it needs, without being entirely dependent upon any of them. <br/>\nGardner&#39;s linguistic intelligence includes qualities of both left and right <br/>\nhemispheric processing of language--both language in the linear sense and <br/>\nlanguage in the enfolded, holistic sense. The linguistic intelligence appears to be <br/>\na combination of several differently evolved systems--expressive gesture, <br/>\nintonation, the cognitive abilities of naming and classifying, and syntactical <br/>\nparsing. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.longleaf.net/ggrow/7In/Linguistic.html&quot;\">http://www.longleaf.net/ggrow/7In/Linguistic.html&quot;</a>&gt;Linguistic <br/>\nIntelligenceLinguistic Intelligence&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.longleaf.net/ggrow/7In/Linguistic.html\">http://www.longleaf.net/ggrow/7In/Linguistic.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":156179923,"authorName":"Ingrid Bauer","from":"&quot;Ingrid Bauer&quot; &lt;ingrid@...&gt;","profile":"natural_wisdom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: learning language","postDate":"1061199525","msgId":79011,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMWIwMWMzNjU2YyQ5N2NhMzI3MCRhNmIxYjVkMEB3aW5kb3dzMms4d3pnbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGJobWdnaitjaG8wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78969,"nextInTopic":79014,"prevInTime":79010,"nextInTime":79012,"topicId":78898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
