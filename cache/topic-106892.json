Not litterers or liars or child <br/>\nabusers. My own YOUNG child who did something thoughtless. If any of my <br/>\nkids threw trash out the window - to be honest, I&#39;d be so shocked that <br/>\nwhat would come out of my mouth would be something like, &quot;Huh?&quot;  But I <br/>\nwas trying to come up with something a 5 or 6 year old might do, <br/>\nthoughtlessly, which they couldn&#39;t undo if they were called on it. Like <br/>\neating all the otter pops.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I was talking about how to respond to something they cannot do <br/>\nanything about right at that moment. I meant that we&#39;re driving at 70 <br/>\nmph down the freeway. (My kids wouldn&#39;t do this either - but JUST this <br/>\nmorning somebody in a car in front of us threw a handful of fast food <br/>\ntrash out their window.

No matter how bad the little girl felt, she couldn&#39;t make <br/>\nit right. The thoughts in her head were probably things like, &quot;What do <br/>\nyou want me to do about it? Throw up so you can have your precious <br/>\ngreen otter pop?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re criticized after the fact and we can&#39;t make it right, there <br/>\nis no recourse but to feel shame - and usually people feeling shame are <br/>\nNOT thinking about how to avoid it next time, but are feeling resentful <br/>\nand angry at the person who shamed them. And a little girl eating all <br/>\nthe otter pops isn&#39;t WORTH shaming her. MUCH easier to just wait - next <br/>\ntime you&#39;re at the grocery store buy a box and have her help put them <br/>\nin the freezer and say, &quot;Last time I didn&#39;t get any green ones, so be <br/>\nSURE to save a couple of them for me this time, okay?&quot; She&#39;s little - <br/>\nthat&#39;s probably all that needs saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - if you see this as something you want to really focus in on - if <br/>\nit is a really big deal and isn&#39;t just the otter pops one time - then <br/>\nenlist her help on how to make sure everybody feels treated fairly.  <br/>\n&quot;How can we make sure some get saved for me? How about for your <br/>\nbrothers and sisters?&quot; Again - she&#39;s little - this should be fun and <br/>\ncasual and I&#39;m talking about her feeling like she&#39;s doing something <br/>\nnice with you, not feeling like she&#39;s being punished or embarrassed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: RE:otterpop advice","postDate":"1119458386","msgId":106917,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNS42MzZmYTQ1NC4yZmVhZWU1MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106916,"nextInTopic":106918,"prevInTime":106916,"nextInTime":106918,"topicId":106892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/22/2005 9:13:17 AM Mountain Daylight Time, deedeanne@yahoo.com writes: -=- Inconsiderate towards other people does make a statement about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-530911440\">In a message dated 6/22/2005 9:13:17 AM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deedeanne@...\">deedeanne@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&quot;Inconsiderate towards other people&quot; does make a statement about  the<br/>\nperson doing the act, though you may mean it to be about the effect  <br/>\non others, to mean that &quot;other people find it inconvenient or  <br/>\nunpleasant.&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kids (teens, boys) make a lot of noise after 10:00 at night when  their <br/>\ndad and the neighbors have to be at work early in the morning, that is  <br/>\ninconsiderate.

I think it makes the<br/>\nstreet/park/playground look messy and sad.  If litter is sticky,<br/>\nsometimes it gets stuck on my shoe -- very annoying and sometimes<br/>\nexpensive, if I have to buy new shoes, but that&#39;s only happened once.<br/>\n There are some kinds of litter that animals try to eat and then hurt<br/>\nthemselves on, and I worry about that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of information, some of it about my emotions, some of it factual.<br/>\n All of it assumes that the child does not need correction as much as<br/>\ngood information and some help with awareness.  I might not give all<br/>\nthis information at once, or even at a time when the child has littered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my problem with the statement that &quot;It&#39;s inconsiderate to do<br/>\nthat&quot; is that people, including adults, do litter, for all sorts of<br/>\nreasons (missed the trash can, dropped something, couldn&#39;t find a<br/>\nplace to put it, were rebelling from years of being told to not<br/>\nlitter) and I think it&#39;s confusing for children if we pretend that we<br/>\nknow a person&#39;s intention or motivation or mindset behind doing so.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Inconsiderate towards other people&quot; does make a statement about the<br/>\nperson doing the act, though you may mean it to be about the effect on<br/>\nothers, to mean that &quot;other people find it inconvenient or unpleasant.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLittering might not be a result of being &quot;inconsiderate&quot; at times. <br/>\nWhat if I drop my Wendy&#39;s bag so that I can catch a little child who<br/>\nis falling, for instance, or give CPR to a person in need?  I might<br/>\nforget to pick it up afterwards, what with all the excitement.  Or<br/>\nwhat if I miss the trash can because I&#39;m distracted by a conversation<br/>\nwith a friend who needs a shoulder to cry on?  Or what if I set my<br/>\nlunch bag aside so that I can push my child on the swing, but it gets<br/>\nknocked off the bench and the wind blows it away?  Or what if somebody<br/>\nis injured and needs to be carried, and there&#39;s no trash can nearby<br/>\nfor my empty soda cup?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first three scenarios, it&#39;s likely that I would pick up the<br/>\ntrash once I discovered the mistake, but my point is that in all those<br/>\nexamples I was being *very* considerate of other people -- that was<br/>\nthe main intention in my own mind, and yet I littered, which you have<br/>\nsaid is &quot;inconsiderate&quot; of me.  My litter may become unpleasant for<br/>\nother people, but my intention certainly was not to be inconsiderate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I would have found confusing as a child, as I watched<br/>\nadults litter for various reasons.  That would have added to my<br/>\nfeeling that sometimes even when I was trying to do the right thing, I<br/>\nwas doing the wrong thing.  It just doesn&#39;t help to paint a happy<br/>\npicture of the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it might be worth thinking about your words a little more, and<br/>\nmaking sure you&#39;re giving good information instead of jumping to<br/>\nconclusions about others&#39; motivations.

I think it is a shame to have a child start thinking of themselves<br/>\nas an inconsiderate person, and I would fear that it would become<br/>\nself-fulfilling if it the child heard it often enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you are speaking for everyone else in the family who may prefer to<br/>\nspeak for themselves. It seems a little similar to the &quot;Royal We&quot; that was<br/>\nfeaturing in another recent thread - Mom saying &quot;we&quot; when she means herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever expressing simply and clearly your own disappointment that the<br/>\nflavors you liked were gone, as you did explain in another email on this<br/>\nthread, sounds like the best course. I remember that email being light and<br/>\nhumorous sounding in comparison to the level of anger that *seems* to be<br/>\ncoming through in your description of your attitude towards the miscreant.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy giving that information you are giving your child the opportunity next<br/>\ntime to possibly think &quot;this color are Mom&#39;s favorite, I&#39;ll leave them for<br/>\nher&quot; and feel good about herself. Eventually she will make the connection<br/>\nbetween being considerate with otter pops to being considerate with other<br/>\nareas also, as she continues to see this being modeled in your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Having a running commentary about why she  SHOULD be<br/>\n&gt;sleepier or SHOULD be asleep doesn&#39;t help her feel her own  feelings.

Now and then she gets back up and turns on the TV until she <br/>\nfalls asleep on the couch.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtime hasn&#39;t been an issue since I &quot;discovered&quot; unschooling.  On two <br/>\nspecific occasions, me sound asleep, her sleeplessness has gotten me up or <br/>\nat least waked me. Once, she came to me at 4:00 complaining that she hadn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen able to fall asleep all night, and wanting to get in bed with me. And <br/>\nthe other time, her stomach was really upset, with heartburn and nausea, and <br/>\nI got up to help her calm down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-=-The main point would be pretty much the same, to try and get<br/>\n&gt;her to  think about how she feels after eating a whole lot of something.<br/>\n&gt;-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How can she think about how she feels with you talking so much?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What? are you saying I talk too much? Why would you think that? I&#39;m sure <br/>\nI&#39;ve never manifested any kind of verbosity on THIS board. ;) LOL But you&#39;re <br/>\nright. I needed to stop, and ask KATIE what made her feel so sleepless that <br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-=- So, it was more<br/>\n&gt;than/other than sugar those nights, but it was  still SOMETHING. It was too<br/>\n&gt;much of something,-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Too much of mom-anger?<br/>\n&gt;Who wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable having just been made to feel really  <br/>\n&gt;guilty?<br/>\n&gt;  The otter pops probably turned to ash in her stomach. (Not  literally,<br/>\n&gt;biblically.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s see here. I&#39;m talking about three different &quot;Otter Pop/Homemade <br/>\npopsicle&quot; binges. Two of them happened in the evening, and on both of those <br/>\nnights, whether from sugar or artificial this and that, she was unable to <br/>\nsleep in one case, and had an anxiety attack in another. The one where I <br/>\ntold her I was angry and thought she was inconsiderate, happened in the <br/>\nafternoon and didn&#39;t affect her sleep. The afternoon binge was the last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndo you think there&#39;s a difference between my saying &quot;don&#39;t eat so many otter <br/>\npops! too much sugar/dye/flavors. You&#39;ll make yourself sick&quot; and my saying <br/>\n&quot;It was inconsiderate of you to eat all those otter pops when other people <br/>\nin the family enjoy them, too.&quot; ? I&#39;m honesty asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child&#39;s actions have a negative effect on the people/place around her, <br/>\ncan it legitimately be pointed out to the child?<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings HeidiC<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106895,"nextTopicId":106920}}
