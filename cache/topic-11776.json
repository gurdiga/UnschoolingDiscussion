When I was in high school I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get past intro to algebra. In fact I didn&#39;t even understand <br/>\nwhat it was that they &quot;taught&quot; me in intro to algebra. I took that <br/>\nclass my sophmore year and was able to get out of taking math the <br/>\nremainder of my high school years by taking Cosmotology my Jr and Sr <br/>\nyears. When I took math in college, about 4 years after I graduated, <br/>\nI was placed in the lowest level of math (3 levels below college <br/>\ncredit algebra). What is interesting is that the whole sememster I <br/>\nspent the class doing the assignment that was given at the start of <br/>\nclass and due the next class. I almost never listened to what was <br/>\nsaid. I just did the math. I think that part of my problem in high <br/>\nschool is that I wasn&#39;t mature enough to understand what was being <br/>\ntaught. The equations just didn&#39;t click. I also didn&#39;t understand <br/>\nwhat algebra had to do with me and my life. I wasn&#39;t going to die if <br/>\nI didn&#39;t know it and life as I knew it wasn&#39;t going to end without <br/>\nthis &quot;all important knowledge&quot; that they said I HAD to know. There <br/>\nwere also other things not related to school that I thought was more <br/>\nimportant. And they were. Anyway, I guess my point is that even <br/>\nthough it had been close to 6 years since anyone had tried to explain <br/>\nto me the algebra, I still passed the class with A&#39;s without <br/>\nstudying, just doing the homework assignments. I also went on to take <br/>\nthe next level, still not college credit, and did the same thing in <br/>\nthat class. The next level, just under college credit, was a <br/>\nchalenge. I ended up dropping all my classes that sememster because I <br/>\nwas working and then became pg. My point is that even though your <br/>\nchild may not be interested in the higher math now the time will come <br/>\nwhen they will need to know it and they will learn it out of desire <br/>\nto move on. Not because they are told they have to or because they <br/>\nare told that life will not be the same without it.

I know that once <br/>\nupon a time we used bob jones for math (not saying anything is wrong with it <br/>\n) this was before we unschooled. The kids hated it. But I kept after them to <br/>\ndo it. Finally it dawned on me that it wasn&#39;t the kids it was curriculum that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t working. Now that we unschool I do not push the kids to do math but I <br/>\ndo try to lead them. My kids are older, 16, 14, 12, and 10. Only the 12 yr <br/>\nold likes math at all. But I have discussed with all the kids how much one <br/>\ndoes need math for many things they may want to do as adults. I bought them <br/>\nMathUsee as it just works better for us. I have some computer programs too <br/>\nfor a practice in facts for the youngest. I also took an idea from another <br/>\nloop and made a gameboard that is an incentive to do math. ( it was supposed <br/>\nto be for reading but it works for math too) Do so many pages of math and you <br/>\nget to roll the die. (example 12) The landing spaces say things like.... a <br/>\nserving of ice cream, 1 movie rental, 1 playstation rental, $1, and etc. It <br/>\nis mainly to motivate my boys, who have a tendency to get too busy outside to <br/>\ncome in. They do not have to play the game but considering that we seldom <br/>\nhave any of the prizes around here they want to. I let my two oldest play too <br/>\nas it would be unfair to make them go without ice cream! Some would consider <br/>\nthis bribery but I consider it just a treat and it works. Also if I want the <br/>\nkids to do something chore wise that I know they will drag out forever I put <br/>\na favorite activity after it. Like, please do these dishes and if you finish <br/>\nin 15 minutes you can watch your favorite cartoon for a half an hour. ( or <br/>\nplay with legos when you are done, whatever you wish). I always tell them <br/>\nthat we have a lot to do here, so if you take forever to do simple tasks it <br/>\nis the fun activities that will have to be left out.

My <br/>\noldest son did the same thing when he went to ps-it would take him hours to <br/>\ndo homework. It was boring for him, and repetitive. Much like doing dishes, <br/>\ncome to think of it.

That would really motivate me <br/>\n(NOT)  Let him instead think of ways you can earn or save enough money to <br/>\nbuy a dishwasher-that will solve both your problems! Let him figure out how <br/>\nmany watts the dryer uses for a load of clothes, versus the sun on the line. <br/>\nThen figure how much a watt costs-if you can put those amounts in a can for <br/>\nyour dishwasher fund, and then add the amounts you put in so you have a <br/>\nrunning total balance. Let him comparison shop for the dishwasher, figure <br/>\nout how to plumb for it, theres measuring and a lot of new vocabulary words <br/>\ntoo. I&#39;m sure you can come up with other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just added a dishwasher to our home, and it is so great! Just the nagging <br/>\nthat I do not have to do anymore is worth twice the price of that lovely <br/>\nappliance.
