If you want to be angry at<br/>\nanyone, be angry at the fundamentalist Christians for appropriating the word<br/>\nChristian and turning it into something narrow that doesn&#39;t reflect your<br/>\nbeliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince most (mainstream) Christians tend to feel their religion is private so<br/>\ndon¹t discuss it much and the (fundamentalist) Christians are very vocal<br/>\nabout their beliefs some people do mistakenly equate fundamentalist beliefs<br/>\nwith all Christians. That is not chance. When fundamentalist Christians<br/>\nspeak their opinions, they self identify themselves as Christians as though<br/>\nthey¹re speaking for all (mainstream) Christians but are actually only<br/>\nspeaking for their narrow definition of Christianity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is *not* safe to make assumptions about how someone is using the word<br/>\nChristian. If you guess wrong you will be, once again, going down the<br/>\nrancorous path we just visited of two people who think they¹re arguing<br/>\ndifferent points of view about the same subject, when they aren¹t discussing<br/>\nthe same subject at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim, I believe, has mistakenly equated fundamentalist beliefs with<br/>\nmainstream Christian beliefs. Sandra (and others?) are using Christian as<br/>\nthe fundamentalist Christians do.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Please* read and respond thoughtfully, with all this in mind. If you are<br/>\nnot aware of the extent of the Christian political movement, then be aware<br/>\nthat there are people here with a great deal more knowledge on the subject<br/>\nof ³Christians² than you have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis topic is *always* a minefield of misunderstanding. All because the<br/>\npolitical movement of fundamentalist Christians has (deliberately) chosen to<br/>\nidentify themselves as Christians.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nUnschooling-dotcom moderator</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OT Same Sex marriage WAS Sharing Culture","postDate":"1056459019","msgId":75302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCMURDMTRCLjFCMzEyJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxMjhmNTIwYjIzMy4yMGIyMzMyMTI4ZjVAc2hhdy5jYT4="},"prevInTopic":75297,"nextInTopic":75306,"prevInTime":75301,"nextInTime":75303,"topicId":75227,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That has got to cloud your vision with other<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think 90% of Christians miss the whole point of the Bible and it ends<br/>\nup becoming a book containing the rules of how to live a *good* life. For me<br/>\nthe Bible is not about morality but God trying to find ways to communicate<br/>\nwith us because He loves us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we can all learn from one another no matter who we are or what we<br/>\nbelieve. If we would just stop(leave the dogma on the doorstep) and listen<br/>\nonce in awhile. That sounds a bit naive doesn&#39;t it. Probably is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I think the differences that exist  in people make life much more<br/>\ninteresting.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, who believes in Jesus but doesn&#39;t really like to use the term<br/>\nChristian and Jesus freak has been way overdone!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
