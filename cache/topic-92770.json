Are you an ageist? I find <br/>\nageism very imcompatible with unschooling. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was from a post that was bounced (by someone else) but I did want to <br/>\ndiscuss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting thought &quot;ageism.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal prejudice is against bullshit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known young people who were not louder than they were worth, who knew <br/>\nhow to qualify their statements even though they were young, and who were aware <br/>\nthat they would (if they didn&#39;t resist it) get wiser as they got older even <br/>\nthough they were out of high school, or college graduates.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known more, though, who were wholly cocky.  As soon as they were in a <br/>\nposition to state their opinions, they did so with embarrassing assuredness to <br/>\nanyone who would listen, and without apology if they were cluelessly missing <br/>\nthe mark they hadn&#39;t even seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so when someone comes to insult the experienced unschoolers here and <br/>\nwon&#39;t show their hand, it&#39;s not an unreasonable question, I think, to ask if <br/>\nthey&#39;re just young and stupid.  Because that&#39;s forgiveable.  But older and stupid <br/>\nmight need different advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy prejudices laid out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think older people are smart just for being older.  Some people never <br/>\nanalyze much that they&#39;ve seen or done, so they can&#39;t say anything too <br/>\nhelpful.  Some, though, DO.  And if they were bright and curious to begin with, <br/>\nthey&#39;ve probably picked up some good insights over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92672,"nextTopicId":92760}}
