I have been here about a month.<br/>\nI am watching this discussion w interest, as I am about as far south as you can get (since South Florida isn&#39;t really &quot;The South&quot;).  <br/>\nIn response to this:<br/>\n&quot;It seems that would mean they think it&#39;s acceptable to most people, <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t <br/>\nit?<br/>\nWhere and in what circumstances are children most openly spanked?&quot;<br/>\nDisrespect of children and spanking IS acceptable to most people here.  In fact, many have a really hard time accepting the fact that I won&#39;t spank mine.  <br/>\nWhere are children openly spanked?  Um, in the grocery store, in elevators, the park, the library....everywhere.<br/>\nAs far as the reasons are concerned, one thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned is religion.  Most folks around here are extremely fundamentalist, conservative....southern Baptist.  I have attended more than one of these churches, and the sermon consists of the preacher pointing at you and hollering how you are going to burn in hell.  I once went to pay my landlord and she got into my car, with my extremely aware, very young child in the back seat, and told me that he could die and be sent to roast in hell because I didn&#39;t take him to her church.  I kept begging her to cut out that imagery in front of my baby and get out of my car, but she refused, stating that I couldn&#39;t ignore it because it could happen.  They believe that God is judgemental, punitive, demands obedience....and so they translate it towards their children.  (PLEASE don&#39;t let me offend anyone&#39;s religion here....I am not stating here that these beliefs are wrong).<br/>\nMy sister holds these beliefs....she goes to a southern baptist church and she beats her kids (though she hates to hear me say it and says she doesn&#39;t beat them, but is lovingly correcting them as is her christian duty)...and she tells me that THE MOST IMPORTANT lesson her children need to learn is obedience.  My family cannot stand to hear me interact w my son, as I consider his viewpoint, and WILL take NO for an answer.  <br/>\nAnyway.  On the ma-am and sir thing, I hate this and was determined to not teach my son anything about it.  I decided to help him learn to address my mom and dad as &quot;Yes, Ama,&quot; and &quot;Yes, Papa,&quot; thinking this would be just as respectful.  But, Alas,  they demand the sir and ma&#39;am.  It seems to me that it is less about him respecting them as doing what is necessary to be respected by them.  That is, if he doesn&#39;t address my mother with a ma&#39;am, then she will not respond to him.  I did try to help him by speaking to him w a yes and no sir, modeling it towards him before he is exposed to them.  SO he started addressing my mom as Yes sir.  I dropped that.  I just try to limit his exposure to them and when they are in contact, she prompts him to call her ma&#39;am.  I don&#39;t say anything.  It is her issue and not mine!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to live in another area where spanking is the exception and not the rule.<br/>\nUntil then, I am daily thankful for the online community which helps to validate my thoughts and opinions and lets me know I am not the only person in the world who realizes that children are fully people.
