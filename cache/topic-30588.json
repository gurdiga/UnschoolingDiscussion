And while <br/>\nI&#39;ve met them and they are also wonderful people, I can&#39;t say they are <br/>\nmore of an attribute to society than say a farm worker. (Well, actually <br/>\npersonally I revere a farm worker far and above a radiologist, but thats <br/>\nmy own bias *smirk)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust today we were talking, happy new year and all, and she asked me if I <br/>\nwas &#39;just going to stay home and be just a mom now that I&#39;m back in <br/>\ntown.&#39;  *smile*<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also stated that her daughter is going to return to work now that the <br/>\nnew baby is almost 3 months old. Her older boy is 2ish. She went on to <br/>\ntell me that her daughter isn&#39;t the type to stay home &#39;because she needed <br/>\nmore of a challange than motherhood.&#39; Again, I smiled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on top side of executive managment. I&#39;ve made some pretty big <br/>\nbux in my life. And the most important and challanging work I&#39;m doing now <br/>\nis staying at home. Its MUCH easier to go off to work somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a shame that anyone should perpetuate the downplaying of roles and <br/>\nup-playing of classes in our society.

These people are selfish <br/>\nand not apart of the community in a way that deems them valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, being a &#39;harder&#39; worker doesn&#39;t make  you a &#39;smarter&#39; <br/>\nworker or more valuable in any way. Like the expression of &#39;running <br/>\naround like a chicken without a head&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If anything, from what I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt;seen, watching TV makes people a bit more willing to lay back and relax. <br/>\n&gt;Does anyone else think that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>TV is a major issue. Its something that can definately be bantered back <br/>\nand forth.<br/>\nYet, I don&#39;t find &#39;laying back&#39; and &#39;relaxing&#39; anything but great <br/>\nattributes of a lifestyle we all should aspire to.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30603,"nextTopicId":30614}}
