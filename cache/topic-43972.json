Yes, I agree where you live would have a lot to do with it! I&#39;d be much more likely to let my kids stay out til whenever if we still lived in our close-knit county in Tennessee where we knew most of the people and they knew us, than I would be here near the big impersonal city of Columbia, SC.<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks Myranda,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I plan on using some of this also when I talk to my husband tonight. I never <br/>\n  had a curfew either and never really stayed out late, Maybe right before <br/>\n  2:00 on just a few occasions. My mom always new where I was even though <br/>\n  there were no cell phones or beepers in those days. I did do some drinking <br/>\n  and drugging but nothing that eve got me into trouble and I graduated top 10 <br/>\n  of my class. My husband had a curfew and was very heavy into drinking and <br/>\n  drugs at a very young age. He just did it all before he had to be home. I <br/>\n  plan on using this too tonight!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s just really hard with teenagers nowadays and I guess a lot of it <br/>\n  depends on where you live too and what the kids are doing. Being that I know <br/>\n  she&#39;s with her boyfiend makes me feel a lot safer. I truse him with her to <br/>\n  keep her safe and he seems very smart about where he wants to go and how to <br/>\n  get there. He&#39;s a bit older in more ways than one. He was mapping out a <br/>\n  pension plan to my daughter the other day. Totally freaked her out!!! So <br/>\n  that helps me too. Not sure if she was just out in a car with a bunch of <br/>\n  girls that I would feel as safe for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Time will tell but she does seem like she doesn&#39;t want to mess up this <br/>\n  chance she&#39;s been given.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n  Join the world&#39;s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
