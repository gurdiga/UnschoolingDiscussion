If I come home with the vision of <br/>\nsomething I can&#39;t have, it&#39;s not as clean as emptyhanded, I come home needy, and <br/>\nlacking.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife doesn&#39;t only go from 0 into the postive numbers.  There are negative <br/>\nnumbers, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent people scale their lives differently.   My kids are not needy kids. <br/>\n Here&#39;s a little bit from a longer article which is here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spoiled\">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Holly, who just turned nine, gets an allowance of 75 cents per year of <br/>\nage, so she was, up to last week, getting $6 a week. Now $6.75.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-We took her to Disneyland. She had saved all her birthday gift money <br/>\n(which amounted to about $35 from her grandmothers and her brother), and her <br/>\nallowance for several weeks, and she had loaned me $20 a few months before and said <br/>\n&quot;Keep it for Disneyland.&quot; She had $104, some in cash and some in &quot;the bank of <br/>\ndad.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-She came back from three days at Disneyland with $84 and a cute safari <br/>\nhat. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Nobody discouraged her from spending her money. She just doesn&#39;t NEED <br/>\nanything, because she gets lots of things when she wants them, and so she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave that desperation to acquire.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays Holly&#39;s allowance is $9 a month; she&#39;s twelve.  Yesterday she had me <br/>\ntake her to buy batteries for two toys she has.  One was something she picked <br/>\nup at a kind of hobbit gift exchange, and it&#39;s an antique &lt;bwg  15 or 20 year <br/>\nold?&gt; electronic recording card (about the size of a pocket calculator) that <br/>\ntook three watch batteries, but she really wanted to see what it would do.  It <br/>\nrecords one minute of voice.  She has played with it a lot, but it took $12 <br/>\nworth of batteries.  The batteries for her pocket spelling dictionary and <br/>\nhangman game were another $4.   Two weeks&#39; allowance for batteries, and she didn&#39;t <br/>\ncomplain a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad or good to window shop.  I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t <br/>\npersonally like it.  I don&#39;t even know if my kids like it or not.  When they go out <br/>\nwith friends, conversation is usually the main thing they report when they get <br/>\nback.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause Kelly who wasn&#39;t poor doesn&#39;t like it, and I (poor me) who was poor <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t either, it&#39;s possible that anyone&#39;s children might not think it&#39;s fun <br/>\neither, for whatever personal reasons those might be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it does seem to me that it has to do with freedom and choice.   Choosing <br/>\nnot to buy is in a different emotional category from the inability to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90734,"nextTopicId":90927}}
