She would<br/>\nwake up in the morning totally dry and look at me and say &#39;poo-poo?&#39; And I<br/>\nwould get her to the potty and take her diaper off for her, and the same for<br/>\nthe rest of the day.  Then I got sick for awhile and it went out the window.<br/>\nBy the time she was 2 she *refused* to let me change her diaper or go potty.<br/>\nThe whole thing was a nightmare complete with huge ulcers all over her butt.<br/>\nI finally had to hire someone to chase her down and get her wet pants off (<br/>\nI was still sick).  If we had less carpet I would have just let her go naked<br/>\nand let my husband mop the floor when he got home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Crispin, I just begged my husband to just not even go there - no<br/>\npressure, no games, nothing.  If he asks to sit on the toilet, fabulous!  if<br/>\nnot, who cares.  We have &#39;big boy&#39; pants in his drawer if he wants them.<br/>\nOnce in a great while he does, but I even hate calling them &#39;big boy&#39; pants.<br/>\nThey are the thick crotch cotton pants, which I have decided are useless.<br/>\nHarriet always just peed in them.  I ended up just buying her underwear<br/>\nfinally and put away all the diapers etc. and just brought lots of changes<br/>\nof clothes with us where ever we went once I was *sure* she had the physical<br/>\nability to get to the toilet.  I figured if we were going to be battling no<br/>\nmatter what, might as well make it about the toilet rather than getting a<br/>\ndiaper on or off her.  I didn&#39;t &#39;punish&#39; her or anything for accidents, but<br/>\nI did groan a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy plan was to let Crispin go naked butt this summer in the yard, but he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to be naked.  How did this happen?  I am *such* a naked person,<br/>\nand our house is pretty nudity friendly, Harriet likes to be naked too.  I<br/>\nguess he just needs to be himself, or different.  So I guess as long as the<br/>\ndiapers fit, he can wear them if he wants. ( we do cloth, Bumkins AIOs) I<br/>\nfigure when he is a little more verbal we can start looking at underpants<br/>\nwhen we are at the store and see if he is interested in them.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHeather, mom to<br/>\nHarriet 12.15.99<br/>\nCrispin 01.25.02<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherette@...\">heatherette@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95977,"nextTopicId":95848}}
