Yes, we had a great experience living in Germany.  I was there <br/>\nfor about 6 mos, as it was the end of dh&#39;s tour there.  We lived in a tiny <br/>\ntown called <br/>\nPlanig.  We lived on the &quot;economy&quot;, to experience the culture instead of <br/>\nliving on base.  We had German landlords, and it was wonderful getting to <br/>\nknow them.  The army base was nearby in a city known as Bad Kreuznach.  This <br/>\nis about an hour south west of Frankfurt.  It was fun to shop alongside the <br/>\nlocals... all the markets and outdoor cafes were exhilarating!  It did rain <br/>\nquite a bit, so it was common to dress in layers, and take along your <br/>\numbrella,and shopping basket each time you went out.  I don&#39;t drink beer <br/>\neither, but the bier gartens were still a great time!  It was a hoot to see <br/>\nmen and women dancing the &quot;chicken dance&quot;  (they called it the duck dance), <br/>\nand some thought nothing of dancing on top of the tables!  :)  They opened a <br/>\nKentucky Fried Chicken  while we were there...  and served french fries with <br/>\nlittle , tiny forks to eat with-- no finger eating!  :)  They also served <br/>\nsoft drinks warm, unless you request it to be cold-- my dh thought that was <br/>\nso gross!  Funny thing, too, is that it is perfectly ok to bring your lap dog <br/>\nwith you shopping and into restaurants.  Many of these dogs would ride in <br/>\nlarge purse-like bags.  It was a great experience, overall, and one that I am <br/>\nglad to have had!  I especially enjoyed the architecture of the half-timber <br/>\nhomes, and when we built our home, we fashioned it after those in Germany, <br/>\nincluding the window boxes, which I love!  Well, sorry to have gone on and <br/>\non; writing about it brought back such good memories!  :)  Guten tag!  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pris","from":"&quot;Pris&quot; &lt;x_t_sipr@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"dn9NmzOhMtp1WBSpVayX37YwJoartE_VnBVOAJP-mKs679Gf59lSYKuTL2Xlh1PshIHb2c1VlDjgWvS6QMlF7gTIihLw6yE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Volkswalking???Sprechen sie Deutsch, Pris?","postDate":"962081088","msgId":10047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYTAwMWJmZGZmMiQ2ZDhiNzk0MCQ0Mjk0Y2RjZkB0ZXhhcy5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGJiLjQ5YTdiMzAuMjY4OTAxZTdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10042,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":10046,"nextInTime":10048,"topicId":9982,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thanks for the info, Bridget ... wow, Irish???  good for you  Pris ...
