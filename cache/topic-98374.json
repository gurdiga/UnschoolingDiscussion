You probably know that, but it is an <br/>\nimportant point I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son had multiple food allergies which have been completely cured <br/>\nthrough the use of homeopathic remedies.  What I used to do is try to <br/>\nguess (or call ahead and ask) what foods would be there when we went <br/>\nsomewhere to eat.  If it was a birthday party, I would make a wheat-<br/>\nfree, dairy-free, peanut free cake and take it along.  I always had <br/>\nacceptable cookies or crackers in my purse in case we went somewhere <br/>\nthat gave out free cookies, so I could give him one without him <br/>\nfeeling like he was missing out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut once I slacked and didn&#39;t have a special piece of cake with me at <br/>\na family birthday party.  AND they had shrimp fried in butter and <br/>\nsomeone made me feel guilty, as if I was depriving him, and I gave in <br/>\nand let him eat everything.  He had cake and shrimp and butter all at <br/>\nonce and his face and throat swelled and he could barely breathe.  I <br/>\nwas a few seconds away from calling 911.  Very scary.  The same kind <br/>\nof thing happened from just eating cantalope.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully we don&#39;t have to deal with those issues at all anymore <br/>\nbecause of homeopathy.  He even eats peanuts with no problem again.  <br/>\nHe still wants nothing to do with cantalope or seafood, but that <br/>\nmight be more because of remembering bad things that happened when he <br/>\nate them.  I think he *could* eat them if he wanted to.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any advice on how to deal with these food challenges<br/>\n&gt; would be welcomed!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s your responsibility to cater to everyone&#39;s food <br/>\npreferences or even to everyone&#39;s food allergies.

IT&#39;s a pain in the butt. I try to keep things <br/>\nout of the house that my son can&#39;t have. His reactions aren&#39;t true <br/>\nallergies, but more a sensitivity that manifests in absolutely out of <br/>\ncontrol behavior on his part, very much like a child with severe ADHD <br/>\nand also some digestive problems. ANd his is corn syrup and high <br/>\nfructose corn syrup (the behaviour)as well as certain kinds of dairy<br/>\n(the digestive problems). I have no issues with sugar, it&#39;s the corn <br/>\nsyrup crap that he really just can&#39;t have. He doesn&#39;t want it, <br/>\nbecause of how he acts, and this is when he doesn&#39;t know it has it. <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried that to make sure it wasn&#39;t just him trying to get away <br/>\nwith something.It&#39;s also how I found out that most hot dogs and hot <br/>\ndog buns have highfructose/corn syrup in them. I have since learned <br/>\nto be very dilligent in reading labels. <br/>\nWhat I do, is I&#39;ll usually talk to a hostess and I&#39;ll bring <br/>\nsomething, or if she&#39;s willing to read a label, then maybe she&#39;ll <br/>\nfind a brand of cake mix that doesn&#39;t have the corn syrup or high <br/>\nfructose stuff, or if we go to a potluck, I&#39;ll make sure I take <br/>\nsomething that he considers a real treat. It may not be the same as <br/>\nwhat the other kids are eating, but he understands.The corn syrup is <br/>\nmuch more of a problem than a little bit of dairy.(he can tolerate <br/>\nsmall amounts without problems)<br/>\n A while back, his dad was eating a carton of ice cream,and he had a <br/>\nlittle bit of it. He really, really wanted more. He bugged me and his <br/>\ndad a lot. I finally just said fine. You know what I have told you <br/>\nthis will do to you. You understand, right? He said yes. I asked him <br/>\nif he still wanted it, when he knew what I had said it would do to <br/>\nhim. (he gets bowel cramps and really bad diarhea) He said yes. So I <br/>\ngave it to him. I really tried to be empathetic the next day when he <br/>\nwas running to the bathroom all morning, and his tummy was upset all <br/>\nday. I did feel sorry for him, he was only 5, but since then, he has <br/>\nnever asked for more than his quarter cup of ice cream that his body <br/>\nWILL tolerate. <br/>\nSometimes, natural consequences are the only thing that teaches them <br/>\nthat what you are trying to tell them is really real. <br/>\nNisha<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, jennefer harper <br/>\n&lt;jenneferh2000@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n I&#39;m lucky that neither of my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; children, nor I have any food allergies.

I have always had to deal with this in my son&#39;s 3 years of<br/>\nlife!  Several of his friends have food allergies as well as having parents<br/>\nwho prefer them to have certain foods over others.  This includes organic<br/>\nfoods only and NO SUGAR!  I&#39;m way into organic foods and definately prefer<br/>\nmy child to eat them, but at the same time let them eat that blue popsicle<br/>\nor Duncan Hines chocolate cake if they want it.  I can understand diets<br/>\nlimited due to food allergies, but it also does make it a challenge<br/>\nespecially at potlucks and parties.  I am just now expressing to their<br/>\nparents how hard it must be for them, and inquiring how the child feels when<br/>\nthey can&#39;t eat something but their friends can.  What the parents have told<br/>\nme is that their child is coming to understand how they don&#39;t feel good<br/>\nafter eating a particular food; so that&#39;s why they avoid it.  But, I do not<br/>\nthink they give the child a choice to eat it or not even in the case of<br/>\nallergies.  With a severe peanut allergy, I can understand not giving the<br/>\nchoice as a result could be anaphylactic shock and death.  But what about<br/>\nless severe allergies?  Should the parent regulate?  Or say, okay, eat dairy<br/>\nif you want to but you will get congested and have an eczema flair up.  I<br/>\nhave been challenged to use all sorts of substitutes like spelt and rice<br/>\nflour instead of wheat, soy instead of dairy, goat instead of cow, honey,<br/>\ndate sugar, maple syrup instead of sugar.  But, I&#39;ve felt bad/guilty for<br/>\nmaking something for a potluck that had sugar in it. <br/>\nAlso, I have felt bad for using a non-organic egg in something for a<br/>\npotluck!  So much so that I pray no one asks less I get exposed!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am dealing with this issue, again, currently with my son&#39;s 3rd birthday<br/>\nparty.  Pizza potluck.  Easy enough?  Everyone can bring their own<br/>\nindividual pizza to share, right?  But will there be enough wheat free,<br/>\ngluten free, organic, soy cheese, no flour crust pizza for everyone who<br/>\nneeds it?  God, I hope so!  And what about the cake?  My son WANTS a<br/>\nchocolate cake.  Fine, he gets it.  Unfortunately I know not every parent<br/>\nwill want their child to eat chocolate.  So, do I get a second non-chocolate<br/>\ncake to make sure everyone&#39;s dietary needs get made?  Sorry, can&#39;t do it<br/>\nthis time.<br/>\n I know that because it will be a chocolate cake, probably made with sugar<br/>\nand flour and possibly with a non-organic egg if we happen to be out of<br/>\norganic eggs that some kids will get none.  I will feel bad.  I will also<br/>\nfeel uncomfortable but I&#39;m so busy being a mom of two small boys that I just<br/>\ncan&#39;t accomodate everyone anymore.  Should I make sure to have a cow dairy,<br/>\nsoy and goat&#39;s ice cream so everyone gets to eat ice cream?  I really hate<br/>\nfor someone not to be able to partake, but it is also a lot of stress and<br/>\nenergy on my part.  I&#39;m lucky that neither of my children, nor I have any<br/>\nfood allergies.  But if we did, I don&#39;t think I would expect there to always<br/>\nbe alternatives for us, and I would bring substitutes/options for my<br/>\nchildren.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on how to deal with these food challenges would be welcomed!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

I really hate for someone not to be<br/>\nable to partake, but it is also a lot of stress and<br/>\nenergy on my part.  I&#39;m lucky that neither of my<br/>\nchildren, nor I have any food allergies.  But if we<br/>\ndid, I don&#39;t think I would expect there to always be<br/>\nalternatives for us, and I would bring<br/>\nsubstitutes/options for my children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on how to deal with these food challenges<br/>\nwould be welcomed!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
