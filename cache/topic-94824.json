Getting off <br/>\ntopic sometimes is inevitable.  Dragging a political matter here and trying to get <br/>\nit to stick is unacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is the text of a post I&#39;ve rejected, yet I&#39;m posting. &lt;g&gt;   The <br/>\nsender&#39;s e-mail address has been inserted so those who are interested can write to <br/>\nher as requested in the text.   Other than this, then, let&#39;s try to keep <br/>\nnon-unschooling, non-homeschooling stuff elsewhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n1/3 of listowners<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\nI received the email about the draft a month or so ago and became very <br/>\nalarmed. I researched it and asked around and there was so much speculation <br/>\nand <br/>\ndisinformation surrounding these bills. Many people thought they had died and <br/>\nweren&#39;t even being considered, so they weren&#39;t worried...except in New York <br/>\nwhere <br/>\nsome friends of my parents mentioned it was still a very hot issue in the <br/>\npress. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to my Congressman&#39;s office and Congress&#39; Thomas search Engine it <br/>\nhas not died; though, for such a disturbing bill it is not receiving much <br/>\npress <br/>\noutside of NY to my knowledge, and that makes me suspicious that the intent <br/>\nis <br/>\nto sneek it through. When I researched comments made re: these bills at the <br/>\nThomas website the thinking behind them is that if everyone is made eligible <br/>\nfor the draft and no one can get out of it or leave the country then Congress <br/>\nwon&#39;t be so quick to go to war because kids they care about will be drafted, <br/>\ntoo. Rationale that makes no sense to me whatsoever. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very real bill and I created an email w/a sample letter and links <br/>\nto congresspeople and lists of committee members whose committees these bills <br/>\nare currently sitting in. If anyone is interested please email me and I&#39;m <br/>\nvery <br/>\nhappy to send it to you.   [<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Rosybluestar@...\">Rosybluestar@...</a>] My feeling is that this bill <br/>\nis way too dangerous for speculation as to whether it will be passed into <br/>\nlaw. I&#39;ve never felt <br/>\nstronger in my life about taking action on anything...these are our babies <br/>\nand <br/>\ngrandchildren whose lives are being threatened. <br/>\n<br/>\nShane is half Canadian and I have his dual citizenship paperwork here. After <br/>\nhe was born and I registered him with the Social security office I <br/>\nimmediately <br/>\nregretted it because of a potential draft (and other reasons, too). Anyway in <br/>\nCanada, if you have dual citizenship and you are called to serve in the <br/>\nmilitary in a country where you are also a citizen that country&#39;s citizenship <br/>\ntakes <br/>\npriority over your Canadian citizenship. I have to double check but I think <br/>\nmerely renouncing your citizenship of the other country won&#39;t cut it. <br/>\nThankfully sneaking across the border is always an option!<br/>\n<br/>\nShane asked me to help him find countries w/out the draft that will welcome <br/>\nour dogs and kitties, so we can move before he turns 18, if the law is <br/>\npassed. <br/>\nI hadn&#39;t mentioned it to him (he&#39;s 5 1/2) until I realised this is so very <br/>\nreal and researched it and took action. He feels much better now that he has <br/>\ntaken action, too....knowing he has options and that he won&#39;t be 18 for a <br/>\nlong <br/>\ntime, but we do know so many people who will be affected by this if it gets <br/>\nthrough.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;WRT the draft, check out this link (urban legends page):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/draft.asp\">http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/draft.asp</a> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94776,"nextTopicId":94830}}
