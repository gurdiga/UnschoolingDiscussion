In Memphis, if  you miss <br/>\nmore than 5 days in a semester, you can be up on truancy charges.   That means <br/>\nif your child is feeling poorly for a day, but is not sick enough to  go to <br/>\nthe doctor, you can only do that 5 times.  The next time you better  run her <br/>\ninto the doctor, even if you don&#39;t have a co-pay or health insurance, or  they <br/>\ncould prosecute you.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty ridiculous.  Have to keep that average daily attendance  up, you <br/>\nknow?  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t feel like getting and up and going early at least once or twice a  <br/>\nweek.
