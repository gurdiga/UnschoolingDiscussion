Thank God they don&#39;t have homework.  Tonight it started to rain and they wanted to go outside with flashlights, dead batteries.  I lit the emergency candles, made quickie holders and sent them on the porch.  They loved to see the glowing lights in the dark.  It was quite and experience.  Even though they play with the other kids in the neighborhood they are best friends with each other first.  They wake up everyday with each other and go to bed with each other.  We figured it out too.

It&#39;s me again! <br/>\n  I was wondering if anyone received my last e-mail introducing myself.  I&#39;ve noticed that when new people e-mail they are at least greeted and questions answered.  So I was thinking maybe my e-mail didn&#39;t go through.  Please, let me know, so I can get my computer fixed if it&#39;s having problems sending. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyways, I was also going to say that I&#39;ve noticed an awesome advantage to my kids learning at home.  My 2-1/2 year old is a very early riser and she usually comes into my room to wake me up.  But the other morning she woke up my 7 year old instead, <br/>\n  and asked him to read to her.  She chose a book, got in bed with him and he read to her.  It was so cute.  It didn&#39;t occur to me until later what was going on.  If my 7 year old was going to a ps this wouldn&#39;t have happened.  We would have been rushing around to get him, and his 5 year old sister, off to school.  Instead, with kids learning at school they learn from one another and teach one another. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Not only are you, as &quot;teacher&quot; teaching, but also each one of your kids get to experience that also.  I&#39;m sure that as much as it is exciting to you when your child learns something new you are trying to share, the child who is trying to teach a younger sibling something gets excited also. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m sure this brings siblings closer and we end up with a tight-knit family instead of only spending a few hours in the evenings together, IF THAT!! (With as much homework as ps send home!!!) <br/>\n<br/>\n  Does anyone know what I mean? <br/>\n  Or am I the last one on earth to figure this one out! : ) <br/>\n<br/>\n  A King&#39;s kid, <br/>\n  Faith <br/>\n  Love is - doing the highest good for the object of your love. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ECSamHill@xxx.xxx","from":"ECSamHill@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"i4BVEK9QoZ9pLmEspb0no8bzM6Bh9oarnkky-CKGtVVJkUPhk8UR90VYsY_6RUSrPiZQqYcp34Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kids Teaching","postDate":"937583723","msgId":3005,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMDkuMzAwNS45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3001,"nextInTopic":3076,"prevInTime":3004,"nextInTime":3006,"topicId":2984,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/16/99 7:28:53 PM, faithb@afes.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1918326220\">In a message dated 9/16/99 7:28:53 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:faithb@...\">faithb@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sure this brings siblings closer and we end up with a tight-knit<br/>\nfamily instead of only spending a few hours in the evenings together, IF<br/>\nTHAT!!
