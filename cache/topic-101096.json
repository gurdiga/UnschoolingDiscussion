What<br/>\n&gt; makes me angry is that he has a PhD in Social<br/>\n&gt; Science, and a lot of his conclusions show a lack of<br/>\n&gt; true understanding of the nature of homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt; Because he is this PhD sociologist people use him as<br/>\n&gt; an &quot;expert&quot; - when he has no personal knowledge of<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In this paper he writes ( I am badly paraphrasing)<br/>\n&gt; that the parent isn&#39;t the only person who has an<br/>\n&gt; interest in the education of the child. The parent.<br/>\n&gt; The child  - hence the free person, separation from<br/>\n&gt; parents at an early age, and the state does. This is<br/>\n&gt; the important part. The state is interested in the<br/>\n&gt; education of its citizens so they can all get nice<br/>\n&gt; paying jobs and stay off welfare, etc.... Ok, but<br/>\n&gt; then why do you decide that the state&#39;s interest is<br/>\n&gt; the more important of the three. This is what public<br/>\n&gt; school does. The child doesn&#39;t have personal<br/>\n&gt; freedom, is not taking part in a diverse democracy.<br/>\n&gt; Overall, his ideas sound very socialist to me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How is it that he feels a public school will allow a<br/>\n&gt; child to be exposed to contrary ideas - or<br/>\n&gt; participate in a diverse democracy? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll bet any homeschooling parent could explain how<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling provides both of these things! We<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t live under a rock! There are so many resources<br/>\n&gt; out there in society, to provide a wealth of<br/>\n&gt; experiences. To me sitting in a classroom for hours<br/>\n&gt; on end, limits these experiences. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I am not far from a PhD in Finance. That doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mean I know everything - or that if I write an<br/>\n&gt; academic paper that I am now an expert. I know how<br/>\n&gt; to write a mean, convincing paper. Too much emphasis<br/>\n&gt; is placed on the degree as a sign of wisdom.

I found it in the University library database from some journal. What makes me angry is that he has a PhD in Social Science, and a lot of his conclusions show a lack of true understanding of the nature of homeschooling. Because he is this PhD sociologist people use him as an &quot;expert&quot; - when he has no personal knowledge of homeschooling! <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this paper he writes ( I am badly paraphrasing) that the parent isn&#39;t the only person who has an interest in the education of the child. The parent. The child  - hence the free person, separation from parents at an early age, and the state does. This is the important part. The state is interested in the education of its citizens so they can all get nice paying jobs and stay off welfare, etc.... Ok, but then why do you decide that the state&#39;s interest is the more important of the three. This is what public school does. The child doesn&#39;t have personal freedom, is not taking part in a diverse democracy. Overall, his ideas sound very socialist to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow is it that he feels a public school will allow a child to be exposed to contrary ideas - or participate in a diverse democracy? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll bet any homeschooling parent could explain how homeschooling provides both of these things! We don&#39;t live under a rock! There are so many resources out there in society, to provide a wealth of experiences. To me sitting in a classroom for hours on end, limits these experiences. <br/>\n<br/>\n I am not far from a PhD in Finance. That doesn&#39;t mean I know everything - or that if I write an academic paper that I am now an expert. I know how to write a mean, convincing paper. Too much emphasis is placed on the degree as a sign of wisdom. If he had actually homeschooled and came to these conclusions, then maybe I could understand his viewpoint . Has he read anything such as Tamara Orr&#39;s book, or David Albert, or Sandra Dodd&#39;s website? What is he possibly researching to come to these conclusions?

Austin <br/>\nState University in Texas, are entrepreneurs. They run a  home-school <br/>\ncurriculum and supplies company, and an online business selling  <br/>\nmaterials to reload shotgun shells. Ashley, Gentry and Hunter pitch  <br/>\nin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve writes books and is a Calvinist minister. They recently  moved <br/>\nfrom Bryan, Texas, to Moscow, Idaho, so he can attend a seminary.  <br/>\nKerry is the primary teacher for the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a family, they  travel to trade shows and conventions, mixing <br/>\nbusiness with the chance to  spend time with other home-schooling <br/>\nfamilies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Becks are active  in their community. They attend church. The <br/>\nparents vote. Their children  play on home-school basketball teams. <br/>\nThe girls love archery, and Ashley is  a three-time state champion <br/>\nskeet shooter for girls her age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe  Becks aren&#39;t sitting at home with windows shuttered and doors <br/>\nclosed, lives  cut off from the rest of the world. So it bothers them <br/>\nand most other home  schoolers when people ask: ``Are your children <br/>\nbeing properly  socialized?&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nA July U.S. Department of Education report on home  schoolers found <br/>\nthat 31 percent kept their children home out of concern  about what <br/>\nchildren are exposed to in public and private schools. Another 30  <br/>\npercent said they wanted to control their children&#39;s understanding of  <br/>\nreligious or moral ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly 16 percent named academic instruction  as a reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recent study and one in 1999 that had similar findings  make it <br/>\nclear that home-schooling parents want to be the primary influence  on <br/>\ntheir children&#39;s moral, ethical and religious views. They don&#39;t want  <br/>\ntheir children to be socialized by educators or other children in the  <br/>\npublic- or private-school setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong Christian home schoolers,  this idea is often expressed as their <br/>\n``worldview.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor others,  known as unschoolers or inclusives, there is a ``me and <br/>\nmy children&#39;&#39;  approach that asserts that no one -- or no government <br/>\n-- should interfere  with their lives. They resent negative outside <br/>\ninfluences and want to keep  their children from being programmed by <br/>\ncommercial, materialistic views  present in society. They want their <br/>\nchildren protected from the cliques,  bullies and potential violence <br/>\nin schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n`Fortress  home&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nOther researchers view the issue differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael Apple,  a University of Wisconsin professor who opposes home <br/>\nschooling, believes  most religious families want their children in a <br/>\nprotected environment, a  phenomenon he calls ``cocooning&#39;&#39; within <br/>\ntheir ``fortress  home.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nHome schools are ``the equivalent of gated communities in which  their <br/>\nchildren will not be tempted by sinful ways or ways that go against  <br/>\ntheir religious beliefs,&#39;&#39; Apple said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said these families have a  worldview that they believe represents <br/>\nthe truth when it comes to God. They  do not recognize, nor do they <br/>\nwant their children exposed to, the broader  society, where <br/>\n``different truths&#39;&#39; may be represented.<br/>\n<br/>\n``That&#39;s a  pretty dangerous position to take, to me. It&#39;s a little <br/>\ndisrespectful of  large numbers of equally religious people who may <br/>\nbelieve that God spoke in  Islamic terms or spoke to Moses or spoke in <br/>\nmultiple Christian voices that  are not recognized as being really <br/>\nChristian by many home schoolers,&#39;&#39; Apple  said. The words ``freedom&#39;&#39; <br/>\nand ``liberty&#39;&#39; ring hollow considering the  intolerance among home <br/>\nschoolers for other ideas, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n``You  can&#39;t say at the same time, `Let a thousand flowers bloom&#39; and <br/>\n`All voices  be heard&#39; and then say, `Yeah, but ours is the only right <br/>\nvoice,&#39; which  means that the ultimate goal for my freedom is to deny <br/>\nyou the freedom. In a  nice way, I will convert you, I will smile and <br/>\ngive you the only truth,&#39;&#39;  Apple said.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuspicion, distrust<br/>\n<br/>\nHome-schooling parents represent  about 2 percent of the school-age <br/>\nchildren in America.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that  home-schooling parents believe their approach is the <br/>\nbest way to educate  children chafes others who continue to enroll <br/>\ntheir children in traditional  settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are feelings of suspicion and distrust on both  sides.<br/>\n<br/>\n``I get people asking me,`Aren&#39;t you worried your kids aren&#39;t  going <br/>\nto socialize?&#39; &#39;&#39; a home-schooling mother told a Beacon Journal focus  <br/>\ngroup in which participants were granted anonymity.<br/>\n<br/>\n``My kids  socialized more after I pulled them out of school than they <br/>\ndid when they  were in school,&#39;&#39; she said. ``I wish that the public <br/>\nunderstood we aren&#39;t  all sitting at home around the kitchen table all <br/>\nday long.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nA  children&#39;s services worker said parents are isolating their <br/>\nchildren. ``I  really think it&#39;s emotional abuse when you don&#39;t allow <br/>\nyour children to  interact with other children, other people,&#39;&#39; she <br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany non-home  schoolers share the belief that home-schooled children <br/>\nare too confined to  their own worlds and that socialization comes <br/>\nfrom learning to get along in  different settings with people from <br/>\ndifferent backgrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n``They  don&#39;t want diversity.

Home schoolers  <br/>\nincreasingly form sports leagues or enter competitions that bring <br/>\nthem  into contact with public- and private-school children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Keyan  Paglialunga, 15, read about a Lego robot competition, he <br/>\nand Anna Friddle,  15, both of Canton, started recruiting teammates <br/>\namong children they knew  from their Creative Learning in My Backyard <br/>\n(CLIMB) home-schooling  group.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an intriguing challenge: build a functioning robot using  <br/>\nmicroprocessors and Lego blocks, and compete against the designs of  <br/>\nother home-schooled, private- and public-school students  statewide.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery Monday for six weeks, they met for half a day at the  NASA Glenn <br/>\nResearch Center near Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  Keyan&#39;s <br/>\nmom, Bonnie, their coach, helped them research the project and  <br/>\nprogram the robot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a Stark County church in February, as the  demonstration began, it <br/>\nwas clear the children worked well together. With  only two team <br/>\nmembers at the competition table at one time, they politely  took <br/>\nturns running ``Bob the Bot.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir entry won the regional  competition, allowing the nine-member <br/>\nteam to go the state championship at  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base <br/>\noutside Dayton, where they finished  third.<br/>\n<br/>\n``I think it was an opportunity of a lifetime,&#39;&#39; said Kevin  Knabel, a <br/>\n13-year-old home-schooled student from Green.<br/>\n<br/>\nOhio  gathering<br/>\n<br/>\nHome schoolers also socialize with other home  schoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a warm June afternoon in Columbus, hundreds of Christian  Home <br/>\nEducators of Ohio members, other parents and their children browsed  <br/>\nthrough the large convention hall at Franklin County Veterans <br/>\nMemorial  auditorium.<br/>\n<br/>\nCHEO is a statewide group, but Ohio has scores of local  home-school <br/>\nsupport organizations whose members meet regularly to share  ideas and <br/>\nlesson plans, receive legal advice, teach needed classes, find  <br/>\nacademic assessors or provide guidance for families.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore than 300  vendors in the convention hall displayed their wares, <br/>\nranging from starter  kits to information on numerous Christian <br/>\ncolleges.<br/>\n<br/>\nThousands of  books were stacked, shelved, mounted on stands or <br/>\nhanging from racks. They  encompassed a range of subjects from math to <br/>\nspelling to hagiographic  biographies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference ended with a high school graduation  commencement <br/>\nceremony.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore 69 students and their parents walked  across the stage, the <br/>\ncrowd stood, placed their right hands over their  hearts, and recited: <br/>\n``I pledge allegiance to the Christian Flag and to the  Saviour, for <br/>\nwhose Kingdom it stands, One Savior, crucified, risen and  coming <br/>\nagain, with life and liberty for all who believe.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nYouth  sports group<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Texas, when Tom Sanders walks into the Kinkaid School, a  private <br/>\nschool in an upscale suburb of Houston, the lanky basketball coach  <br/>\nand father of six home-schooled children is greeted with affection.  <br/>\nYoung people grab his arm and smile. Men throw their arms around him <br/>\nand  embrace with a comfortable hug.<br/>\n<br/>\nSanders, a lawyer and registered Texas  lobbyist for the Home School <br/>\nLegal Defense Association, formed theHomeschool  Christian Youth <br/>\nAssociation for his children and several hundred others who  wanted a <br/>\nchance to play basketball, baseball, softball and volleyball and to  <br/>\ndevelop their Christian character.<br/>\n<br/>\n``It became very personal for me  because I had a son who fit that <br/>\ncategory,&#39;&#39; Sanders said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe coaches  the varsity boys basketball team that has been invited to <br/>\nopen tournaments  in Texas and has traveled to Oklahoma to play. He <br/>\nsaid the team is  equivalent to a small public or private school for <br/>\nclassification purposes,  and was one of the better squads in Texas <br/>\nlast season.<br/>\n<br/>\n``One huge  reason is the character of these young men. They&#39;re not <br/>\nperfect, but they&#39;re  very teachable, very attentive, very willing to <br/>\nlearn, very willing to apply  themselves to do what we ask,&#39;&#39; Sanders <br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said home schooling  and parents&#39; rights take precedence over the <br/>\nteam.<br/>\n<br/>\n``I had a practice  last night. One of my best players didn&#39;t come <br/>\nbecause Mom and Dad had  family plans. What am I going to do? Yell at <br/>\nthem to disobey Mom? Disobey  Dad?&#39;&#39; Sanders said.<br/>\n<br/>\nReligious motivations<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve and Kerry Beck  acknowledge that it is what many evangelicals <br/>\ncall their ``Christian  worldview&#39;&#39; that drives them. The phrase means <br/>\nthat all aspects of the  universe owe their existence to a Christian <br/>\nGod.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said they  pulled their children from private religious schools <br/>\nbecause teachers were  stressing academics rather than building a <br/>\nreligious foundation.<br/>\n<br/>\n``We  really want our kids to rule and reign for Christ. We couldn&#39;t <br/>\ndo that on a  haphazard basis,&#39;&#39; said Steve Beck. ``The whole idea is <br/>\nwe&#39;re training  battle-hardened soldiers for Christ. The private <br/>\nChristian school wasn&#39;t  going to do that.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Becks wanted a sense of togetherness in their  church, so they <br/>\njoined the small, rural Confederation of Reformed  Evangelicals that <br/>\nwas active in the community.<br/>\n<br/>\n``I saw it as a very  good way to disciple men,&#39;&#39; Steve Beck said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe influence has been  profound. The family moved to Idaho in August <br/>\nso that Steve can study at a  seminary run by Douglas Wilson, an <br/>\noutspoken critic of big government and  especially public education.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilson co-authored a book that argues that  Civil War abolitionists <br/>\nignored the teachings of the Bible, which recognizes  slavery.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeck said Wilson&#39;s ``main goal is to get people to think.&#39;&#39; The  Bible <br/>\nurges good relationships between slaves and masters, and that&#39;s what  <br/>\nprevailed in the prewar South, Beck said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe South was fighting for  states&#39; rights, not for slavery, Beck <br/>\nsaid. Because the South lost, we now  have the ``leviathan&#39;&#39; <br/>\ngovernment intruding on all aspects of our  lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic schools are an example, he said. Before public education  was <br/>\ncreated in the 1800s, anyone who wanted an education could find one  <br/>\nfor free, and the literacy rate was much higher than it is today, he  <br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeck said that people coming out of Wilson&#39;s school are  ``changing <br/>\nthe culture from the inside out,&#39;&#39; and that Christians need to  <br/>\ninfiltrate the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n``We&#39;re in the New Covenant. We&#39;re not using  swords. We&#39;re using the <br/>\nSpirit,&#39;&#39; Beck said.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his book, A Father&#39;s  Stew, Beck writes that Christians must reject <br/>\nthe notions that women need  work to be fulfilled, parents should <br/>\npursue careers by dumping their  children in day-care centers <br/>\n(disparagingly referred to as ``concentration  camps&#39;&#39;) and education <br/>\ncan be provided only by so-called experts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe  Becks want their children to go to college, but they have <br/>\ndifferent  aspirations for the three, depending on the gender.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve Beck would like  his son to become an engineer and wants the <br/>\ngirls to get liberal arts  degrees so they are able to ``have sons and <br/>\ndaughters and teach them to  think.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n``I&#39;m not keen on a daughter becoming a doctor and working 90  hours a <br/>\nweek,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nJorge Gomez, president of the North Texas  Home Educators Network in <br/>\nthe Dallas-Fort Worth area, has a worldview  similar to the Becks&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGomez, who came to the United States from Mexico  when he was 7, <br/>\nprefers the Anglicized pronunciation ``George&#39;&#39; for Jorge. He  <br/>\ndiscourages discussion of his Hispanic heritage and of diversity <br/>\namong  home schoolers because ``we are all one. Home schooling is the <br/>\ngreat  equalizer.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nGomez, a businessman, and his wife, have three children and  are <br/>\nevangelical Christians. He chooses to ``home-church&#39;&#39; by not  <br/>\nparticipating in an organized congregation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s troubled by pop  culture and what children learn in organized <br/>\nschools.<br/>\n<br/>\n``We have the  freedom to choose. In a school, you don&#39;t know what <br/>\nbooks they&#39;re being  shown. There are more quotes from Marilyn Monroe <br/>\nthan from FDR or about  World War II. They don&#39;t need pop culture or <br/>\nrevisionist history,&#39;&#39; Gomez  said.<br/>\n<br/>\nImage problem<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strong religious views that the Becks,  Gomez and others hold can <br/>\nstir anti-home schooling feelings in the larger  community. In <br/>\ninterviews and focus groups, many non-home schoolers pointed  to a <br/>\n``holier than thou&#39;&#39; attitude that they said permeates many families  <br/>\nin the movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nA public-school parent said in a Beacon Journal  focus group that a <br/>\nrelative is a fundamentalist Christian who  home-schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n``There is just this arrogance. We all laugh and say, `What  is she <br/>\ngoing to do when she gets to heaven and we are standing there  <br/>\ngreeting her?&#39; She is going to have a fit when she gets up there, and  <br/>\nthere we are,&#39;&#39; the parent said.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome home schoolers are aware of  this image problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n``Sometimes I think, coming from a home-schooled  mentality, we have <br/>\nto be very careful that we are not teaching our children  that home <br/>\nschoolers are better than other people,&#39;&#39; a Christian mother  said.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers and inclusives in the movement unite with their  Christian <br/>\ncounterparts on most home-school issues, but they often resent  <br/>\nefforts to impose biblical, faith-based ideas about such topics as  <br/>\nabortion, same-sex marriage and stem-cell research on them and the <br/>\nrest  of society.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a focus group, an unschooler mother said Christian home  schoolers <br/>\nare rigid in their beliefs -- ``Everybody else is  wrong.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough religious home schoolers garner the most attention, the  <br/>\nmovement is vast and diverse.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********More diverse<br/>\n<br/>\nPam  Sorooshian, an econometrician from Long Beach, Calif., describes <br/>\nherself as  a non-Christian, politically independent person in a <br/>\nmulticultural marriage.  She believes home schoolers are unfairly <br/>\ntargeted for criticism because they  are so closely identified with <br/>\nthe religious right.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorooshian is  co-founder of the National Home Educators Network, a <br/>\ngroup known as  ``inclusives&#39;&#39; because members represent a network of <br/>\nvarious religions,  races, ethnicities and family structures. The <br/>\ngroup includes bisexuals,  pagans, atheists, Mormons, Catholics, <br/>\nBaptists, Jews, Muslims, blacks,  Latinos, Asians and Middle Eastern <br/>\nfamilies, she said.<br/>\n<br/>\n``We have  mixed families, gay couples with children, single mothers, <br/>\nworking mothers.  We have stay-at-home dads. We have a far better <br/>\ncross section of the  community than the elementary school that we <br/>\npulled my 9-year-old out of,  which was all-white, had no other races <br/>\nof any kind, and every kid there  came from an upper-middle-class <br/>\nneighborhood surrounding the school,&#39;&#39;  Sorooshian said in a <br/>\npresentation at the annual American Educational  Research Association <br/>\nmeeting in San Diego this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n``Inclusive&#39;&#39; is  a term referring to a group open to anyone, <br/>\nincluding Christians, Sorooshian  told the Beacon Journal.<br/>\n<br/>\n``There is a huge difference between the typical  Christian home <br/>\nschooler and the typical inclusive home schoolers,&#39;&#39;  Sorooshian said. <br/>\n``Inclusives have an underlying desire to have their kids  out in the <br/>\nworld and more exposed to the world. Christian home schoolers are  <br/>\njust trying to protect their children.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said the idea that  inclusive children from home-schooling <br/>\nfamilies are growing up intolerant  and uncivil is ludicrous.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said she started home schooling because her  children&#39;s public <br/>\nschool was not diverse enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, her children  are exposed to a wide variety of people of <br/>\ndifferent backgrounds, ages,  religions and cultures.<br/>\n<br/>\n``In our case, we wanted far more real  relationships than what our <br/>\nkids were getting in school,&#39;&#39; Sorooshian  said.<br/>\n<br/>\nBacker wants oversight<br/>\n<br/>\nRob Reich, a Stanford University  professor who maintains that he <br/>\nsupports home schooling, believes that many  parents wield too much <br/>\ncontrol over their children and don&#39;t want them  exposed to contrary <br/>\nideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe contends that children need to learn to  participate in a diverse <br/>\ndemocracy.<br/>\n<br/>\n``In no other setting are parents  as able to direct in all aspects <br/>\nthe education of their children, for in  home schools they are <br/>\nresponsible not only for determining what their  children shall learn, <br/>\nbut when, how and with whom they shall learn,&#39;&#39; Reich  said in a <br/>\npublished essay, Testing the Boundaries of Parental Authority Over  <br/>\nEducation: The Case of Homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany home-schooling parents see  Reich as an opponent because he wants <br/>\ngovernment to play a larger oversight  role.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said that while home-schooling parents insist they must have the  <br/>\nfreedom to raise their children, they often are intolerant of anyone  <br/>\nwith different views.<br/>\n<br/>\n``Children can grow up to become ethically  servile to their parents, <br/>\nwhich is incompatible with them being free  persons,&#39;&#39; Reich saidin a <br/>\nBeacon Journal interview.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his speeches  and writings, Reich talks about two concepts of <br/>\nsociety: one in which  citizens vote their own interests and the <br/>\nmajority rules; and one in which  citizens are involved, talk to each <br/>\nother and exchange ideas in the public  forum before taking a majority <br/>\nvote.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe believes that home-schooling  parents are preventing their children <br/>\nfrom being part of the public forum,  and that the children are being <br/>\nraised in isolation. If they&#39;re not part of  that forum, they may not <br/>\nknow that other views on life exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n``I  think that is a potentially disabling aspect of home schooling,&#39;&#39; <br/>\nReich told  the Beacon Journal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state cannot mandate that children from diverse  backgrounds come <br/>\ntogether, but Reich said government can and should insist  upon <br/>\ncurricula that expose children to different religions, cultures and  <br/>\npoints of view.<br/>\n<br/>\n``Not all home schoolers are going to like this, but  this will be <br/>\npart of the aim of regulation -- to ensure that even within a  <br/>\nhome-school environment, children are introduced to and exposed to <br/>\nthe  world of diversity in a liberal democracy,&#39;&#39; Reich said at the <br/>\nsame  discussion of education research that Sorooshian attended.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorooshian,  the inclusive, countered that home schoolers are <br/>\nperplexed when they hear  that kind of idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n``Do we know if we can teach good citizenship?&#39;&#39; she  asked. ``Do we <br/>\nknow anything about how to teach it? How can they regulate us  to make <br/>\nsure we taught our children good citizenship? Require them to go to  <br/>\nGirl Scouts?&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nExtracurriculars<br/>\n<br/>\nReich believes public schools  should be required to let home-schooled <br/>\nchildren play on sports teams and in  bands, and sign up for other <br/>\nextracurricular activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n``It&#39;s the  wrong stance to take from a public point of view to forbid <br/>\nhome-school  children from participating in public school <br/>\nactivities,&#39;&#39; Reich told the  Beacon Journal. ``It ought to be done <br/>\nprecisely because it gives the  home-school kids an opportunity to <br/>\ninteract with more people than they would  otherwise in a way that <br/>\nmight have civic benefits.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the movement  has grown, more home-schooled children are having <br/>\ncontact with public  schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2001 U.S. Department of Education study, released in July of  this <br/>\nyear, found that about 20 percent of the estimated 1.1 million  <br/>\nhome-schooled students were enrolled part time in public  schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany states give local school officials the authority to accept  or <br/>\nreject home-school students on a part-time basis. In return, some  <br/>\ndistricts that accept part-timers receive funding based on how many  <br/>\nclasses a home-schooling student takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugh Caumartin,  superintendent of Bowling Green schools in northwest <br/>\nOhio, said he has seen  an increase in home schoolers interacting with <br/>\nhis district.<br/>\n<br/>\n``We do  have home-schooled students taking classes in our schools. <br/>\nTypically, they  take music, art, science with labs, sports,&#39;&#39; <br/>\nCaumartin said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese  interactions have not come without friction. Home schoolers are <br/>\naccused of  cherry-picking public services.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome schoolers counter that they pay  taxes and should be allowed to <br/>\ntake classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinances,  fairness<br/>\n<br/>\nMost states defer to local school districts, giving  superintendents <br/>\nand boards the authority to devise policies on accepting  home <br/>\nschoolers for classes or extracurricular activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome public  school officials refuse to provide services to <br/>\nhome-schooled students,  citing finances and fairness as reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany school officials believe  extracurricular activities are rewards <br/>\nor bonuses used as incentives for  academic achievement. Public school <br/>\nstudents must meet certain academic  standards -- such as passing <br/>\ntests or achieving minimum grade-point averages  -- before being <br/>\nallowed to play on a sports team or take part in  extracurricular <br/>\nactivities. Home-schooled students are not held to the same  standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Easton, Pa., home schoolers and the school board clashed  over <br/>\nallowing children to play football. In Texas, legislation has been  <br/>\nintroduced to give home schoolers access to sports and debate teams. <br/>\nIn  West Virginia, a judge ruled a family could place their son on a <br/>\nwrestling  team. In Dayton, Christian schools have accepted home <br/>\nschoolers into their  classes and included them in extracurricular <br/>\nactivities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough  home schoolers and their attorneys have been consistently <br/>\nvictorious in  legal battles, this is one area where courts have <br/>\ndecided in favor of public  schools more often than not.<br/>\n<br/>\n``I wish that the schools would be more  accepting of kids joining in <br/>\nsports and the extracurricular activities like  band,&#39;&#39; an unschooler <br/>\nmom in a Beacon Journal focus group said. ``I think  the one thing we <br/>\nwould want to go to high school for is the extracurricular  <br/>\nactivities.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe offered a solution that would not be popular with  most public <br/>\nschool parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n``I would ultimately like to see the  extracurricular stuff taken <br/>\ncompletely out of the schools and made  free-standing, like Barberton <br/>\nLittle League is not a school-related  organization. It&#39;s a separate <br/>\nthing, and the kids go play baseball  together,&#39;&#39; she said.<br/>\n<br/>\nComing Wednesday: Troubling situations in home  schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5006,"nextTopicId":101116}}
