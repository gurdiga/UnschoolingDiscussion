The question my experiences in the classroom raise is<br/>\n&gt;why have these young people been educated to such abysmal depths of<br/>\n&gt;ignorance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t read,&quot; says a junior without the slightest self-<br/>\n&gt;consciousness. She has not the smallest hint that professing a<br/>\n&gt;habitual preference for not reading at a university is like bragging<br/>\n&gt;in ordinary life that one chooses not to breathe. She is in my &quot;World<br/>\n&gt;Literature&quot; class. She has to read novels by African, Latin American,<br/>\n&gt;and Asian authors. She is not there by choice: it&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt;a &quot;distribution&quot; requirement for graduation, and it&#39;s easier than<br/>\n&gt;philosophy--she thinks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The novel she has trouble reading is Isabel Allende&#39;s &quot;Of Love and<br/>\n&gt;Shadows,&quot; set in the post-coup terror of Pinochet&#39;s junta&#39;s Nazi-<br/>\n&gt;style regime in Chile, 1973-1989. No one in the class, including the<br/>\n&gt;English majors, can write a focussed essay of analysis, so I have to<br/>\n&gt;teach that. No one in the class knows where Chile is, so I make<br/>\n&gt;photocopies of general information from world guide surveys. No one<br/>\n&gt;knows what socialism or fascism is, so I spend time writing up<br/>\n&gt;digestible definitions. No one knows what Plato&#39;s &quot;Allegory of the<br/>\n&gt;Cave&quot; is, and I supply it because it&#39;s impossible to understand the<br/>\n&gt;theme of the novel without a basic knowledge of that work--which used<br/>\n&gt;to be required reading a few generations ago. And no one in the class<br/>\n&gt;has ever heard of 11 September 1973, the CIA-sponsored coup which<br/>\n&gt;terminated Chile&#39;s mature democracy. There is complete shock when I<br/>\n&gt;supply US de-classified documents proving US collusion with the<br/>\n&gt;generals&#39; coup and the assassination of elected president, Salvador<br/>\n&gt;Allende.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Geography, history, philosophy, and political science--all missing<br/>\n&gt;from their preparation. I realize that my students are, in fact, the<br/>\n&gt;oppressed, as Paulo Freire&#39;s &quot;The Education of the Oppressed&quot; pointed<br/>\n&gt;out, and that they are paying for their own oppression. So, I<br/>\n&gt;patiently explain: no, our government has not been the friend of<br/>\n&gt;democracy in Chile; yes, our government did fund both the coup and<br/>\n&gt;the junta torture-machine; yes, the same goes for most of Latin<br/>\n&gt;America. Then, one student asks, &quot;Why?&quot; Well, I say, the CIA and the<br/>\n&gt;corporations run roughshod over the world in part because of the<br/>\n&gt;ignorance of the people of the United States, which apparently is<br/>\n&gt;induced by formal education, reinforced by the media, and cheered by<br/>\n&gt;Hollywood. As the more people read, the less they know and the more<br/>\n&gt;indoctrinated they become, you get this national enabling stupidity<br/>\n&gt;to attain which they go into bottomless pools of debt. If it weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;tragic, it would be funny.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Meanwhile, this expensive stupidity facilitates US funding of the<br/>\n&gt;bloody work of death squads, juntas, and terror regimes abroad. It<br/>\n&gt;permits the war we are about to wage--an unfair, illegal, unjust,<br/>\n&gt;illogical, and expensive war, which announces to the world the<br/>\n&gt;failure of our intelligence and, by the way, the creeping weakness of<br/>\n&gt;our economic system. Every man, woman, and child killed by a bomb,<br/>\n&gt;bullet, famine, or polluted water will be murder--and a war crime.<br/>\n&gt;And it will signal the impotence of American education to produce<br/>\n&gt;brains equipped with the bare necessities for democratic survival:<br/>\n&gt;analyzing and asking questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let me put it succinctly: I don&#39;t think serious education is possible<br/>\n&gt;in America. Anything you touch in the annals of knowledge is a foe of<br/>\n&gt;this system of commerce and profit, run amok. The only education that<br/>\n&gt;can be permitted is if it acculturates to the status quo, as happens<br/>\n&gt;in the expensive schools, or if it produces people to police and<br/>\n&gt;enforce the status quo, as in the state school where I teach.<br/>\n&gt;Significantly, at my school, which is a third-tier university,<br/>\n&gt;servicing working-class, first-generation college graduates who enter<br/>\n&gt;lower-etchelon jobs in the civil service, education, or middle<br/>\n&gt;management, the favored academic concentrations are communications,<br/>\n&gt;criminal justice, and social work--basically how to mystify, cage,<br/>\n&gt;and control the masses.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This education is a vast waste of the resources and potential of the<br/>\n&gt;young. It is boring beyond belief and useless--except to the powers<br/>\n&gt;and interests that depend on it. When A Ukranian student, a three-<br/>\n&gt;week arrival on these shores, writes the best-organized and most<br/>\n&gt;profound essay in English of the class, American education has<br/>\n&gt;something to answer for--especially to our youth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But the detritus and debris that American education has become is<br/>\n&gt;both planned and instrumental. It&#39;s why our media succeeds in telling<br/>\n&gt;lies. It&#39;s why our secretary of state can quote from a graduate-<br/>\n&gt;student paper, claiming confidently that the stolen data came from<br/>\n&gt;the highest intelligence sources. It&#39;s why Picasso&#39;s &quot;Guernica&quot; can<br/>\n&gt;be covered up during his preposterous &quot;report&quot; to the UN without<br/>\n&gt;anyone guessing the political significance of this gesture and the<br/>\n&gt;fascist sensibility that it protects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cultural fascism manifests itself in an aversion to thought and<br/>\n&gt;cultural refinement. &quot;When I hear the word &#39;culture,&#39;&quot; Goebbels<br/>\n&gt;said, &quot;I reach for my revolver.&quot; One of the infamous and telling<br/>\n&gt;reforms the Pinochet regime implemented was educational reform. The<br/>\n&gt;basic goal was to end the university&#39;s role as a source of social<br/>\n&gt;criticism and political opposition. The order came to dismantle the<br/>\n&gt;departments of philosophy, social and political science, humanities<br/>\n&gt;and the arts--areas in which political discussions were likely to<br/>\n&gt;occur. The universities were ordered to issue degrees only in<br/>\n&gt;business management, computer programming, engineering, medicine and<br/>\n&gt;dentistry-- vocational training schools, which in reality is what<br/>\n&gt;American education has come to resemble, at least at the level of<br/>\n&gt;mass education. Our students can graduate without ever touching a<br/>\n&gt;foreign language, philosophy, elements of any science, music or art,<br/>\n&gt;history, and political science, or economics. In fact, our students<br/>\n&gt;learn to live in an electoral democracy devoid of politics-- a<br/>\n&gt;feature the dwindling crowds at the voting booths well illustrate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote that, in the rapacity that the<br/>\n&gt;industrial revolution created, people first surrendered their minds<br/>\n&gt;or the capacity to reason, then their hearts or the capacity to<br/>\n&gt;empathize, until all that was left of the original human equipment<br/>\n&gt;was the senses or their selfish demands for gratification. At that<br/>\n&gt;point, humans entered the stage of market commodities and market<br/>\n&gt;consumers--one more thing in the commercial landscape. Without minds<br/>\n&gt;or hearts, they are instrumentalized to buy whatever deadens their<br/>\n&gt;clamoring and frightened senses--official lies, immoral wars,<br/>\n&gt;Barbies, and bankrupt educations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Meanhile, in my state, the governor has ordered a 10% cut across the<br/>\n&gt;board for all departments in the state--including education.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Luciana Bohne can be contacted at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lbohne@...\">lbohne@...</a>.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

She is in my &quot;World<br/>\nLiterature&quot; class. She has to read novels by African, Latin American,<br/>\nand Asian authors. She is not there by choice: it&#39;s just<br/>\na &quot;distribution&quot; requirement for graduation, and it&#39;s easier than<br/>\nphilosophy--she thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe novel she has trouble reading is Isabel Allende&#39;s &quot;Of Love and<br/>\nShadows,&quot; set in the post-coup terror of Pinochet&#39;s junta&#39;s Nazi-<br/>\nstyle regime in Chile, 1973-1989. No one in the class, including the<br/>\nEnglish majors, can write a focussed essay of analysis, so I have to<br/>\nteach that. No one in the class knows where Chile is, so I make<br/>\nphotocopies of general information from world guide surveys. No one<br/>\nknows what socialism or fascism is, so I spend time writing up<br/>\ndigestible definitions. No one knows what Plato&#39;s &quot;Allegory of the<br/>\nCave&quot; is, and I supply it because it&#39;s impossible to understand the<br/>\ntheme of the novel without a basic knowledge of that work--which used<br/>\nto be required reading a few generations ago. And no one in the class<br/>\nhas ever heard of 11 September 1973, the CIA-sponsored coup which<br/>\nterminated Chile&#39;s mature democracy. There is complete shock when I<br/>\nsupply US de-classified documents proving US collusion with the<br/>\ngenerals&#39; coup and the assassination of elected president, Salvador<br/>\nAllende.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeography, history, philosophy, and political science--all missing<br/>\nfrom their preparation. I realize that my students are, in fact, the<br/>\noppressed, as Paulo Freire&#39;s &quot;The Education of the Oppressed&quot; pointed<br/>\nout, and that they are paying for their own oppression. So, I<br/>\npatiently explain: no, our government has not been the friend of<br/>\ndemocracy in Chile; yes, our government did fund both the coup and<br/>\nthe junta torture-machine; yes, the same goes for most of Latin<br/>\nAmerica. Then, one student asks, &quot;Why?&quot; Well, I say, the CIA and the<br/>\ncorporations run roughshod over the world in part because of the<br/>\nignorance of the people of the United States, which apparently is<br/>\ninduced by formal education, reinforced by the media, and cheered by<br/>\nHollywood. As the more people read, the less they know and the more<br/>\nindoctrinated they become, you get this national enabling stupidity<br/>\nto attain which they go into bottomless pools of debt. If it weren&#39;t<br/>\ntragic, it would be funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, this expensive stupidity facilitates US funding of the<br/>\nbloody work of death squads, juntas, and terror regimes abroad. It<br/>\npermits the war we are about to wage--an unfair, illegal, unjust,<br/>\nillogical, and expensive war, which announces to the world the<br/>\nfailure of our intelligence and, by the way, the creeping weakness of<br/>\nour economic system. Every man, woman, and child killed by a bomb,<br/>\nbullet, famine, or polluted water will be murder--and a war crime.<br/>\nAnd it will signal the impotence of American education to produce<br/>\nbrains equipped with the bare necessities for democratic survival:<br/>\nanalyzing and asking questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me put it succinctly: I don&#39;t think serious education is possible<br/>\nin America. Anything you touch in the annals of knowledge is a foe of<br/>\nthis system of commerce and profit, run amok. The only education that<br/>\ncan be permitted is if it acculturates to the status quo, as happens<br/>\nin the expensive schools, or if it produces people to police and<br/>\nenforce the status quo, as in the state school where I teach.<br/>\nSignificantly, at my school, which is a third-tier university,<br/>\nservicing working-class, first-generation college graduates who enter<br/>\nlower-etchelon jobs in the civil service, education, or middle<br/>\nmanagement, the favored academic concentrations are communications,<br/>\ncriminal justice, and social work--basically how to mystify, cage,<br/>\nand control the masses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis education is a vast waste of the resources and potential of the<br/>\nyoung. It is boring beyond belief and useless--except to the powers<br/>\nand interests that depend on it. When A Ukranian student, a three-<br/>\nweek arrival on these shores, writes the best-organized and most<br/>\nprofound essay in English of the class, American education has<br/>\nsomething to answer for--especially to our youth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the detritus and debris that American education has become is<br/>\nboth planned and instrumental. It&#39;s why our media succeeds in telling<br/>\nlies. It&#39;s why our secretary of state can quote from a graduate-<br/>\nstudent paper, claiming confidently that the stolen data came from<br/>\nthe highest intelligence sources. It&#39;s why Picasso&#39;s &quot;Guernica&quot; can<br/>\nbe covered up during his preposterous &quot;report&quot; to the UN without<br/>\nanyone guessing the political significance of this gesture and the<br/>\nfascist sensibility that it protects.<br/>\n<br/>\nCultural fascism manifests itself in an aversion to thought and<br/>\ncultural refinement. &quot;When I hear the word &#39;culture,&#39;&quot; Goebbels<br/>\nsaid, &quot;I reach for my revolver.&quot; One of the infamous and telling<br/>\nreforms the Pinochet regime implemented was educational reform. The<br/>\nbasic goal was to end the university&#39;s role as a source of social<br/>\ncriticism and political opposition. The order came to dismantle the<br/>\ndepartments of philosophy, social and political science, humanities<br/>\nand the arts--areas in which political discussions were likely to<br/>\noccur. The universities were ordered to issue degrees only in<br/>\nbusiness management, computer programming, engineering, medicine and<br/>\ndentistry-- vocational training schools, which in reality is what<br/>\nAmerican education has come to resemble, at least at the level of<br/>\nmass education. Our students can graduate without ever touching a<br/>\nforeign language, philosophy, elements of any science, music or art,<br/>\nhistory, and political science, or economics. In fact, our students<br/>\nlearn to live in an electoral democracy devoid of politics-- a<br/>\nfeature the dwindling crowds at the voting booths well illustrate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe poet Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote that, in the rapacity that the<br/>\nindustrial revolution created, people first surrendered their minds<br/>\nor the capacity to reason, then their hearts or the capacity to<br/>\nempathize, until all that was left of the original human equipment<br/>\nwas the senses or their selfish demands for gratification. At that<br/>\npoint, humans entered the stage of market commodities and market<br/>\nconsumers--one more thing in the commercial landscape. Without minds<br/>\nor hearts, they are instrumentalized to buy whatever deadens their<br/>\nclamoring and frightened senses--official lies, immoral wars,<br/>\nBarbies, and bankrupt educations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanhile, in my state, the governor has ordered a 10% cut across the<br/>\nboard for all departments in the state--including education.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLuciana Bohne can be contacted at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lbohne@...\">lbohne@...</a>.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103301,"nextTopicId":103199}}
