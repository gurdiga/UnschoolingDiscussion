In<br/>\n&gt; the next 6  months they will all be 10, 9 and 4. I seem to have an immunity<br/>\n&gt; although I was  never tested. If I do have that immunity, my kids may have it<br/>\n&gt; also. My oldest  has had them before the others were born. Someone I know of<br/>\n&gt; has <br/>\n&gt; a child with  them now and I&#39;m wondering about exposing them like I&#39;ve heard<br/>\n&gt; people do while  the kids are young.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A bunch of my friends and I did a pox party and it was a good thing in my<br/>\nopinion.  Most of the kids got moderate cases of them so we felt good about<br/>\nimmunity without it being dangerously miserable like it can be once you hit<br/>\npuberty.  My then 2 yo got a very tolerable case.  My son was 3 months old<br/>\nand he only got a few, although another friend&#39;s baby a week older got a<br/>\nvery full case of them.  Everyone is different but it seems the general<br/>\nconsensus is that they are milder and safer if the kids are younger, and<br/>\nthat the vax isn&#39;t very effective even if it were something you were<br/>\ninterested in in the first place.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHeather, mom to<br/>\nHarriet 12.15.99<br/>\nCrispin 01.25.02<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherette@...\">heatherette@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96711,"nextTopicId":96728}}
