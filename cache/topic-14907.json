Our library has a<br/>\nfair selection.  We&#39;ve enjoyed Charlotte&#39;s Web, read by the author,<br/>\nnumerous times.  Harry Potter is great on tape too, since it is read in<br/>\nEnglish, rather than American!  You will learn how to really pronounce<br/>\nHermione!  My Louisiana Sky is another great book on tape - read with the<br/>\nsouthern accent and a very touching story.  The whole family looks at the<br/>\nnewspaper (5 yr old likes the weather page).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will probably finish Charlie and the Chocolate Factory today.

That&#39;s the test I use whether<br/>\nsomething is for us or not.  If we aren&#39;t enjoying our ourselves then there<br/>\nare so many other things we should choose to do.  Our reading aloud time has<br/>\ngone in cycles. Some years we do tons of it  and at other times we hardly<br/>\never sit together.   I carried a cough around for a few months last year<br/>\nthat wouldn&#39;t let me read more than 3 sentences without having a spasm, so<br/>\nright now we are out of the habit of reading together.  I&#39;m hoping Jan<br/>\nbrings a change to that. We used to read for an hour or more at bedtime, but<br/>\nthat shifted also as the kids got older.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no magic *way* to become educated. The activities and materials<br/>\nthat work one year won&#39;t work the next, what with growth and maturity<br/>\nchanges.  Even financial changes have a way of impacting home education, the<br/>\nyears when we have a bit extra we travel more and go more places, thus<br/>\nwilding changing our daiily schedules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSearching is good.  I think it&#39;s something most of us all during these<br/>\nyears. Searching for new materials, experiences and new ways to spend out<br/>\ntime.  Worrying and struggling though, that&#39;s usually counterproductive<br/>\nthough, as the time and energy spent doing these things takes away from<br/>\nsearching and actually living together.  I find things that fill our days<br/>\nwith activities we enjoy and when they begin to wane or become dull and<br/>\nrepetitive, I strike out on another search..... along with my kids.  The<br/>\nolder they get the more they know what they want to learn about and how.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich part are you struggling with?  Right now I&#39;m struggling with wanting<br/>\nto actuall listen to everything my children want to tell me.  With kids 7,<br/>\n8, and 10 it seems my days are filled with constant chatter and here I am<br/>\ncraving peace and quiet.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"dawn","from":"dawn &lt;dawn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"X2TcCJvuekmw4L7mJuPriPdGpo7eWE3PUDPiDUZsvNOFNWo5Uhi2KRGwetu3BcY6BPvvYMiBX4yEous","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Mother of BORED","postDate":"978913038","msgId":14914,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBpbmUuQlNGLjQuMjEuMDEwMTA3MTYxMTMyMC40NTU1Ny0xMDAwMDBAbWF0ZS5ranNsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTA3MjE0MS5RQUExMzc1M0Bib25lcy53bmNsaW5rLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14912,"nextInTopic":14915,"prevInTime":14913,"nextInTime":14915,"topicId":14907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"we spend quite a bit of time reading  outloud (or being read to my the elder child).

I also read a lot to the boyz<br/>\nwhen they are in the tub.  Then we also do lots of books on tape.  Just<br/>\nbrought home one of the Dragon Riders of Pern series tonight and Where the<br/>\nREd Fern Grows (#1 son tired of reading it, but was enjoying the story--we<br/>\nread the novel a few winters ago and neither parent can muster the<br/>\nenthusiasm for re-reading it outloud).  We alos routinely read Discovery<br/>\nand Scientific American outloud with the elder son and Ranger Rick with #2<br/>\nson.  All OUt loud.  #3 son, 7 months, enjoys Bunny, My HOney and Eric<br/>\nCarle books.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndawn h-s<br/>\n**********<br/>\nSome who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>\nwild if they are not controlled.

Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>\njustify the use of control.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Alfie Kohn,  Punished by Rewards, p. 33.<br/>\n**********</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carol Gilliam","from":"&quot;Carol Gilliam&quot; &lt;jeannie@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cz2ul6RaSrOieMwufN2pnK3hOFS0WM-a-C4Ty-57Uz56KEf250LNe9M7qOsNQsG9UT5pNlO4OaVs53Cd4CaUIhtZTHu5ehUz0wjqaw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Mother of BORED","postDate":"978903721","msgId":14912,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTA3MjE0MS5RQUExMzc1M0Bib25lcy53bmNsaW5rLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14907,"nextInTopic":14914,"prevInTime":14911,"nextInTime":14913,"topicId":14907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Amy mentioned that she reads to her kids.
