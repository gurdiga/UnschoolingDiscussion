Support you local pigeon!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo Pigeons Spread Disease? In a word &#39;no&#39;!  All wild birds have the potential <br/>\nto pass on diseases to other birds and to human beings but the chances of <br/>\nthis happening are a million to one, certainly in the case of human beings.   <br/>\nPigeons are no more likely to transmit diseases to human beings than any other <br/>\nspecies of wild bird. Why then do we read horror stories in the media every day <br/>\nabout the 60 or 70 fatal diseases that pigeons are capable of transmitting to <br/>\nhuman beings?  Because the pest control industry and those that have a vested <br/>\ncommercial interest in controlling pigeons have a very efficient propaganda <br/>\nmachine constantly churning out scare stories designed to sell their products.  <br/>\nPest control is a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide and culling pigeons <br/>\nand selling proofing products represents a large proportion of the profits <br/>\nwithin this industry.  Because scientific research has proved that culling <br/>\npigeons is a completely ineffective method of control the pest control industry has <br/>\nto scare the public into believing that they need to be concerned about <br/>\npigeons.  The best way to do that is to link pigeons with diseases. <br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.racingbirds.com/disease.html&quot;\">http://www.racingbirds.com/disease.html&quot;</a>&gt;disease&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n~~~ Becky~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president,<br/>\n or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only <br/>\nunpatriotic and servile, <br/>\nbut is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>\n---Theodore Roosevelt<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1018,"nextTopicId":75491}}
