I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI traded Bibles with my best friend, but she showed up about an hour later <br/>\nbecause her mom had freaked out that she had a protestant Bible in the house <br/>\nand needed their Catholic Bible back RIGHT THEN.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom being one of the two coordinators of the music for folk mass, I ended up <br/>\nhanging out with one of the priests a fair amount.

It is okay <br/>\nfor an individual Baptist to ignore the beliefs of the church he&#39;s been <br/>\nbaptized into, has joined of his own free will.  It is okay (with me, and <br/>\nwith some who post here) for a Roman Catholic mass-attending person to say &quot;I <br/>\nam Catholic&quot; but to ignore the dictates of the Pope.

I have to say I am surprised<br/>\nand dismayed by the close-minded words I have seen you type on this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record, I&#39;m a non-fundamentalist pro-life person who (as many other<br/>\npeople who don&#39;t believe in routine abortion) practice responsible birth<br/>\ncontrol and do not proselytize my beliefs to others nor condemn other people<br/>\nfor their choices. Let&#39;s not see the world in black-and-white. There are all<br/>\nkinds of people who hold pro-choice beliefs, from those who work to help<br/>\nchildren born to parents who don&#39;t want or care for them all the way to the<br/>\nNARAL head worker I know who uses abortion as birth control (has had 5 so<br/>\nfar). Obviously it would not be fair if I used my co-worker the casual<br/>\nabortion-getter who talks about her former babies as &quot;the little blobs&quot; to<br/>\nbe got rid of, to represent all people who are pro-choice. There are all<br/>\nkinds of people who are pro-life, from abortion-clinic bombers and<br/>\nin-your-face proselytizers to quiet people who live their lives in<br/>\naccordance with their own beliefs and feel strongly in their hearts that<br/>\nkilling children (even unborn) is wrong but who do not condemn others for<br/>\nthe choices they make or beliefs they hold. Obviously it would not be fair<br/>\nto use the abortion-clinic bomber to represent all people who are pro-life.<br/>\nEven among Catholics, there is a huge spectrum in beliefs and practices. Any<br/>\ntime we lump all people who hold a particular belief under one single<br/>\nbanner, we cheat ourselves of recognizing the diversity of human belief, and<br/>\nof learning something about the way other people think and feel. We also<br/>\nhurt feelings and impair the ability to communicate honestly and openly.
