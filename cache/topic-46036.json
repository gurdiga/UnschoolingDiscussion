First of all, I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1900823224\">I&#39;ve had to deal with this situation in our house. It started out with just <br/>\nmy own kids and now has not been a problem when others come over. First of <br/>\nall, I don&#39;t believe in making a child play with another if they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto, whether it&#39;s a sibling or not. Just as much as I don&#39;t think kids should <br/>\nhave to share their things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy three younger ones are soon to be 2, 7 and 8. The 7 (Sierra) and 8 <br/>\n(Joseph) year olds have always been close. (no kidding!) They had to share a <br/>\nroom up until about 2 years ago. But even then I always made sure they each <br/>\nhad a place to go to get away from each other when they wanted<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking sure they each were allowed their own time and a safe place to go <br/>\nmade it work for them. Not having to play with the other made an impact too. <br/>\nWhen the baby came along, it changed.  She was walking at 9 months but not <br/>\nreally into the other kids until around a year. By then, the kids each had <br/>\ntheir own room and were able to go to each other&#39;s rooms to play as long as <br/>\nthe other one agreed. If one wanted to be alone, the other had to respect <br/>\nthat. We also have a fairly large playroom so there were a few different <br/>\nalternatives. The only thing was to make the kids aware of the small things <br/>\nthey had needed to stay out of the playroom, where everyone was welcome. <br/>\nLittle dangerous toys had to stay in their rooms. One trip to the ER with a <br/>\ngagging baby was enough!!! The baby was okay with not going in their rooms <br/>\nuntil about 3 months ago. Then she started to notice they would leave her <br/>\nout of what they were doing. At first it was easy to keep Alyssa busy while <br/>\nthey had their together time without her. They also did play with her in the <br/>\nplayroom on their own. When Alyssa started to get upset about being left <br/>\nout, I spoke with both Joseph and Sierra and explained how the baby must <br/>\nfeel when they play without her. In a round about way, they learned about <br/>\nrestrictions. How the more they kept her out of their rooms, the more she <br/>\nwanted in. Gradually Joseph on his own, would allow Alyssa in to his room. <br/>\nMostly she just wanted to look around. When he realized her attention span <br/>\nwas so short, he had no problem with her playing with his stuff. It was all <br/>\nbaby steps and it was easy for him to see what a difference this all made to <br/>\nher and to him. He started to explain it to Sierra, and they both ended up <br/>\nincluding Alyssa in a lot of play time. Not all of it, but that was okay <br/>\ntoo. For all the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Alyssa gathers up her people and goes and knocks on Joseph&#39;s door and <br/>\nwhen he lets her in, she thinks who she is. They all 3 play so well together <br/>\nand Alyssa doesn&#39;t mind when she&#39;s kept out because she&#39;s also included a <br/>\nlot. When other friends come to play, it works the same way. Joseph and <br/>\nSierra are so use to having her play with them that their friends are okay <br/>\nwith it too. And they know that they don&#39;t HAVE to play with her if they <br/>\nchose not to. If they had to play with her all the time, even if they played <br/>\nwell, I could understand wanting a friend all to themselves when one was <br/>\naround.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this has gotten way too long but I&#39;ve worked real hard on this as <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen so many siblings at each other&#39;s throats a lot. And I must say I <br/>\nam very proud of the way they are all handling their relationships with each <br/>\nother.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A sticky parenting question","postDate":"1034220613","msgId":46048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5LjI5ZDIxMWVkLjJhZDY0ZTQ1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46043,"nextInTopic":46050,"prevInTime":46047,"nextInTime":46049,"topicId":46036,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/9/02 7:28:31 PM, mactier@xtra.co.nz writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-296350245\">In a message dated 10/9/02 7:28:31 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mactier@...\">mactier@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My first instinct was they have to include her, but now I&#39;m second <br/>\nguessing myself and wondering if my eldest might actually have the right to <br/>\nchoose not include his little sister??
