In fact, I almost never use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\nin what I write. John Holt used the terms &quot;homeschooling&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;unschooling&quot; interchangeably, and I don&#39;t want to give up the <br/>\nturf! Let the none &quot;homeschoolers&quot;(unschoolers) find another word.  <br/>\n(I&#39;m not much fond of the term &quot;homeschooling&quot; either -- very little <br/>\nof it happens at home, and it bears only the slightest relationship <br/>\nto what goes on in school.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my house, where our practice differs from that of SOME unschoolers <br/>\nis that we do a lot of goal setting. The education is still &quot;child-<br/>\ndirected, family-centered&quot;, but I&#39;m also a believer in the theory of <br/>\nFLOW -- small goals set and small goals met lead to larger ones <br/>\nlater. We are little bound by the tyranny of subject matter, and we <br/>\nput the kids&#39; pursuit of their own passions first on our collective <br/>\nfamily lists, but we do explicitly help them set goals for <br/>\nthemselves, and help them evaluate them along the way -- I want them <br/>\nto become self-aware of the journey.  The important terms in the <br/>\ntitle are &quot;Voyage of Self-Discovery&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe original title of the book is the current sub-title (A Journey of <br/>\nOriginal Seeking) -- publisher wasn&#39;t buying it, although a big <br/>\npublisher was interested in the book, provided I scrub all references <br/>\nto homeschooling! But, as I write, I decided to stick to my knitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.
