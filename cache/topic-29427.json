Most of you are <br/>\nprobably aware that my Dad suffered a paralyzing stroke the day after <br/>\nthe terrorist attacks, and life as our family has known it hasn&#39;t <br/>\nbeen the same since. I&#39;ve found myself finding plenty of reasons to <br/>\nrejoice through it all, though. Small things, which I probably <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have even slowed down for a year ago, or even six months <br/>\nago. I seem to be seeing many things differently these days, and it <br/>\nrelates to this list as a realization that I don&#39;t have time - don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to take the time - to plow through the agony of posts like those <br/>\nwe&#39;ve seen in the past few weeks. So in that respect I guess the <br/>\ndecision is based on my own personal selfish interests, isn&#39;t it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;11.
