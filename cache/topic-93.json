I will be doing <br/>\n<br/>\na show for the 4-H Electricity Camp at the University of Tennessee, some <br/>\nscience consulting and public shows at the American Museum of Science and <br/>\nEnergy <br/>\nin Oak Ridge, TN on Saturday.   I will be doing shows on lightning and The <br/>\nScience of Fireworks.   You can contact the museum for show times and <br/>\nadmission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week&#39;s experiment has its roots in a phone conversation I had with my <br/>\nfriend Mik Jacobs (The Fire Guy, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/findmik/)\">http://members.aol.com/findmik/)</a>.   He is on <br/>\na <br/>\nwhirlwind tour, including Hong Kong, California and South Carolina.   We were <br/>\n<br/>\ndiscussing different ways to explain simple science experiments.   Later as I <br/>\n<br/>\nwas doing the dishes, I followed up some of the ideas and would up with this <br/>\none.   You will need:<br/>\n<br/>\na drinking glass<br/>\na sink or bathtub<br/>\nwater<br/>\na paper plate or piece of cardboard<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will begin with a common, simple experiment.   Fill the glass to the top <br/>\nwith water.   Place the paper plate firmly over the top of the glass.   <br/>\nHolding <br/>\nit over the sink (in case it doesn&#39;t work), hold the plate firmly in place <br/>\nand turn the glass upside down.   Then release the plate.   It should stay in <br/>\n<br/>\nplace, and the water should stay in the glass.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?   It is tempting to think that the plate is holding the water in, but it <br/>\n<br/>\nis not.   The plate is keeping the air out.   The air pressure outside the <br/>\nglass is holding the water in.   How can we show that?  Well, first, we can <br/>\nlet <br/>\nsome air in to take the place of the water.   Keeping the glass over the <br/>\nsink, <br/>\npull down on one side of the plate, just enough to let a little air get in.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens?   The water gushes out.   But wait.   Doesn&#39;t that also fit <br/>\nwith the theory that the plate was holding the water in?   <br/>\n<br/>\nTo check that, we need to get rid of the plate.   Fill the sink most of the <br/>\nway with water.   Holding the glass sideways, place it in the water.   Once <br/>\nit <br/>\nis totally filled with water, turn it upside down, keeping it under the <br/>\nsurface.   Lift it slowly upwards.   Though most of the glass is above the <br/>\nsurface, <br/>\nthe water stays inside the glass.   As long as the mouth of the glass is <br/>\nunder <br/>\nwater, no air can get into the glass, and the water can&#39;t come out.   The <br/>\nexternal air pressure holds the water in, even without the plate.   As soon <br/>\nas <br/>\nthe edge of the glass is lifted above the surface, air rushes in, and the <br/>\nwater <br/>\nrushes out.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can something as light as air hold up that much water?   The air around <br/>\nyou is pressing on everything with quite a bit of pressure.   At sea level, <br/>\nit <br/>\npresses with 14.7 pounds on each square inch of surface.   If you draw a grid <br/>\n<br/>\nof one inch squares on a piece of paper, you can place the mouth of the glass <br/>\n<br/>\non the paper and see about how many square inches it covers.   Multiply that <br/>\nmy 14.7 pounds and you can see that you have quite a bit of pressure pushing <br/>\nupwards.   When the glass if full of air at the same pressure, you have the <br/>\nsame <br/>\namount of push downwards as upwards.   They balance each other.   With the <br/>\nglass full of water, when the water starts to move downwards, there is <br/>\nnothing <br/>\nto take its place.   This produces an area of extremely low pressure.   The <br/>\nhigher pressure on the outside is then plenty strong enough to keep the plate <br/>\nin <br/>\nplace.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a marvelous week.<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\nThis weekly e-mail list is free from charge.

I&#39;m Rebecca sahm to 2 boys Jaiden and Avery and wife to Jason. We have been together for almost 8 yrs, and married for 1 1/2. I just turned 25. We live in San Diego Ca. We decided to hs in March of this year (after the constant nagging of my parents as to why Jaiden wasn&#39;t in preschool) I began researching hsing and all of the different options that I had, have to admit I looked into the whole school at home thing, I was very interested in Waldorf and Mason for a while, until one day I just watched my kids and BOOM I got it, this was their journey not mine, this was their path and their life to live not mine (and just becase something interested me did not mean that it would interest them.) I began to look at it as my privilege not my right to be able to share the journey with them and I will follow as long as they let me, I will help when they ask but I will (try really really hard) not lead. That realization was really a big one for me. I am also blessed with a dh that belives not only in hs but in unschooling, and is active in thr boys life. We do have are problems and things that we still need to work on and I do have to admit that everyday I read something on this list that gets me thinking and looking at my parenting and everyday I think i become a better parent and a better me. and I want to say thank you to all of you.
