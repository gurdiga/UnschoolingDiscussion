Has nothing whatsoever to do with how I choose to raise and educate my children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReligion as a factor in others&#39; perceptions of what &quot;homeschooling&quot; means, is annoying to me also, as religion DOES enter into our homeschooling lives, in a very natural and non-forced way.  We do not have religious study time per se, yet I will freely discuss and share anything aobut our family beliefs with my children, or about the beliefs of others, that they want to know.  As members of a religion without temples or churches, all our worship is done at home or in outdoor settings, and our children are a part of that as far as they are interested in being included.  But!  When you tell anyone you are homeschooling, they automatically assume that you are Christian or Christian based, especially in semi-rural, very Mormon, SE Idaho.  I do not enlighten EVERYONE, as it can be very detrimental to our lives due to active perjudice, but I do not lie about it either.  If someone is rude enough to ask point blank, or assumes and says that we are Christian or Mormon, I politely tell!<br/>\n them that we do not prescribe to any organized religion, or that we are not Christian.
