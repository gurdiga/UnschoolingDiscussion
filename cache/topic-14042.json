Titled &quot;My Encounters with Science,&quot; Shirakawa writes about his<br/>\n&gt; childhood in rural Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, and how he became<br/>\n&gt; interested in science.)*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I cannot recall exactly when I took a liking to science, particularly<br/>\n&gt; chemistry. No special event comes to mind which may have inspired me. One<br/>\n&gt; thing for certain, though, is that I spent 10 years of my childhood, from<br/>\n&gt; the third grade until graduation from high school, in Hidatakayama, which<br/>\n&gt; is blessed with nature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; North, south, east, west -- no matter which way I headed, a mere five- to<br/>\n&gt; 10-minute walk from my home would take me to a stream or a rice field,<br/>\n&gt; and beyond that, it was just mountains and more mountains. Crawling<br/>\n&gt; around the swamp looking for *mosengoke* (roundleaf sundew), or running<br/>\n&gt; about with a net catching insects was what my days were all about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, my interest in nature was aroused at a much younger age. I<br/>\n&gt; believe I was three or four years old, when we were living in Taipei. I<br/>\n&gt; vaguely remember watching, with tireless fascination, countless cicada<br/>\n&gt; larvae crawl out of a tree trunk which had fallen during a typhoon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I heard my brother and sister discussing whether or not to take a<br/>\n&gt; baby bird from its nest in the yard, I felt eager to hold the bird in the<br/>\n&gt; palm of my hand. Memories such as these, however, were part of any<br/>\n&gt; childhood back then, so it is not as if my experience was in any way<br/>\n&gt; unique. I suppose, then, that in my case, moving on to live in a place<br/>\n&gt; like Takayama enabled me to expand on my early experiences with nature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chemistry is a field in the natural sciences which looks at the structure<br/>\n&gt; and characteristics of matter, as well as the chemical reactions which<br/>\n&gt; occur when atoms and molecules link to form matter. It can be said that<br/>\n&gt; the workings of nature, in particular the workings of life, are all a<br/>\n&gt; result of chemical reactions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yet, no matter how hard you observe nature, these reactions will not take<br/>\n&gt; place in front of your eyes. The opportunity to become familiar with<br/>\n&gt; chemistry is quite limited indeed; most people have to wait until<br/>\n&gt; elementary school, when performing experiments in science class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fortunately, I experienced much at home in addition to what I learned in<br/>\n&gt; school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have both an older and younger brother, as well as an older and younger<br/>\n&gt; sister. A family with five children was not unusual at the time, but my<br/>\n&gt; mother was always very busy. To help out with the housework, each child<br/>\n&gt; did his or her share.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was in charge of cooking the rice and getting the bath ready, even<br/>\n&gt; though I did not perform these chores every day. I don&#39;t remember whether<br/>\n&gt; I also washed the rice, but my mother added the required amount of water<br/>\n&gt; for me. My job was to start the fire to cook the rice, and to heat the<br/>\n&gt; bath. We used firewood for fuel, so I was able to learn from experience<br/>\n&gt; how to make a fire and keep it under control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of the two chores, cooking rice kept me busier, as I had to keep a close<br/>\n&gt; watch of the fire, but when preparing the bath, I did not need to pay as<br/>\n&gt; much attention and had plenty of time to play around while waiting for<br/>\n&gt; the water to heat up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I discovered then, that when I added newspaper soaked in salt water to<br/>\n&gt; the fire, I would get a yellow flame. I was able to see for myself an<br/>\n&gt; actual flame reaction which I had learned about in a textbook.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also played with empty ampoules, readily available since my father was<br/>\n&gt; a practicing doctor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After filling one with matchsticks, I would place it in the fire, and<br/>\n&gt; watched as first, white steam, and then, a bright orange flame came<br/>\n&gt; bursting out. When the ampoule was cool, I found the matchsticks inside<br/>\n&gt; had been transformed into black charcoal while retaining their original<br/>\n&gt; shape.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All these &quot;experiments&quot; were amusing to me. This was, most likely, my<br/>\n&gt; first encounter with chemistry, and my little trials were equal to the<br/>\n&gt; famous lessons that the English chemist and physicist, Michael Faraday,<br/>\n&gt; taught using candles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my elementary and junior high school days, I was not only interested<br/>\n&gt; in catching insects, but in plants as well. I wanted to try my hand at<br/>\n&gt; making a beautiful flower bloom. What is now known as electronics also<br/>\n&gt; caught my fancy, and I made several radios using crystal, and later, a<br/>\n&gt; vacuum tube and transistor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These were times of change for Japan. The country was moving out of its<br/>\n&gt; war stricken poverty and gradually into economic recovery. Efforts to<br/>\n&gt; learn from the West and make advances in science and technology, which<br/>\n&gt; had fallen behind during the war years, were beginning to bear fruit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Plastics was a good example. Ordinary, everyday items were now being made<br/>\n&gt; out of this material.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When graduating from junior high school, we each wrote a composition<br/>\n&gt; about our future, and I wrote that I wanted to go on to college to study<br/>\n&gt; plastics. I soon forgot about the piece, and how I came to write what I<br/>\n&gt; did. I lost the composition itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the day that I retired from Tsukuba University, I locked the door to<br/>\n&gt; my office, which I had cleaned out over the course of the year, and<br/>\n&gt; headed home after returning my key, ID, health insurance certificate and<br/>\n&gt; other items.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I could not help but feel a tinge of loneliness when I realized I would<br/>\n&gt; no longer be working with my students, but I was satisfied with my<br/>\n&gt; accomplishments. Although I would have no title, I was thrilled to think<br/>\n&gt; that I had 24 hours a day to do as I pleased without any obligations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was on this day that I suddenly remembered what I had written in<br/>\n&gt; junior high school. I had an urge to know why, how, and for what purpose<br/>\n&gt; I had wanted to study plastics at that age. I no longer had the book of<br/>\n&gt; compositions, however, and had been so out of touch with my former<br/>\n&gt; classmates that I could not bring myself to ask someone to lend me a copy<br/>\n&gt; after all these years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Luckily, when I received this century&#39;s last Nobel award in chemistry<br/>\n&gt; along with two of my friends, the morning newspapers carrying the news<br/>\n&gt; also printed my composition, which I read for the first time in over 40<br/>\n&gt; years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A few days ago, one of my former classmates was kind enough to send me a<br/>\n&gt; copy of the book, so I now know that it was titled &quot;Michishirube,&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; Guidepost, a collection of compositions written by the fourth graduating<br/>\n&gt; class of Takayama Municipal Public Junior High School No. 2. I would like<br/>\n&gt; to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to my classmate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After reading my composition, I was struck by how well I had understood<br/>\n&gt; plastic as a junior high school student.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Making observations, or seeing things as they are, is the key to studying<br/>\n&gt; chemistry as well as all fields of science. It seems I had mastered the<br/>\n&gt; skill of observation while running around the mountains looking for<br/>\n&gt; insects, or sitting in front of the stove watching the fire burn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why? My work, which was honored by the Nobel prize, was born out of<br/>\n&gt; observing and learning from failed experiments. If I had not paid close<br/>\n&gt; attention, it may have ended as just another experiment gone wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unlike physics, many students say chemistry is difficult because there is<br/>\n&gt; much to be memorized. True, compared to physics, which attempts to<br/>\n&gt; organize natural phenomena into a unified system, chemistry, which deals<br/>\n&gt; with a variety of matter produced by chemical reactions, must seem<br/>\n&gt; complex indeed. But if one has a clear sense of purpose, and the will to<br/>\n&gt; learn, knowledge will follow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Upon receiving the Nobel award this year, I was pleasantly surprised to<br/>\n&gt; find that I was congratulated not only by my colleagues, but also by<br/>\n&gt; children, students from junior high, high school and college, and many,<br/>\n&gt; many others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was especially touched when about 30 fifth grade children from a school<br/>\n&gt; nearby wrote essays to celebrate my award and personally delivered them<br/>\n&gt; to my house with their teacher. They came back on another day with a<br/>\n&gt; model of an atom they had made in science class, and hung it on my hat<br/>\n&gt; rack.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Concern has been raised that the younger generation tends to shy away<br/>\n&gt; from studying science, but let me say that children do like and have a<br/>\n&gt; natural interest in the subject.
