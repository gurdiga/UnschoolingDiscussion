Since this<br/>\n&gt; time my 5yos has started to display poor loosing manners. If it looks<br/>\n&gt; like he is loosing the game or will loose the game he will have a<br/>\n&gt; fit, throw his cards down and sit and pout. I finally told him that<br/>\n&gt; the behavior was not appropriate and that everyone wins sometimes and<br/>\n&gt; everyone looses sometimes. Tonight I ended up sending him to bed<br/>\n&gt; early because he would not sit still during the game of Memory we<br/>\n&gt; were playing and he kept messing up the cards we had laid on the<br/>\n&gt; floor. Finally, after telling him repeatedly that he needed to sit<br/>\n&gt; still and quit jumping around I made him sit out of the game. He sat<br/>\n&gt; on the opposate side of the room while DD and I finished the game. At<br/>\n&gt; the start of the next game I told him that if he would sit still then<br/>\n&gt; he could come and join the game with us which he decided not to. And<br/>\n&gt; that was fine except that he kept complaining that he wanted to play<br/>\n&gt; the game but &quot;Mommy won&#39;t let me.&quot; I repeated that he could play with<br/>\n&gt; us, and that we wanted him to play with us, and that he would have to<br/>\n&gt; sit still and that all his jumping around was messing up the cards.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, after his repeated complaining I finally sent him to bed. I<br/>\n&gt; know a lot of his problem was that he was tired. I guess what I want<br/>\n&gt; to know is this type of behavior normal for a 5yob. This is not the<br/>\n&gt; first time he has had a fit over loosing a game and lately he seems<br/>\n&gt; to be doing things that he knows he is not supposed to and then gets<br/>\n&gt; angery with me when I disapline him. It has been going on for about a<br/>\n&gt; month now and I&#39;m really getting tired of it. I just don&#39;t know if it<br/>\n&gt; is a phase he is going through or if I should be wondering if<br/>\n&gt; something else is on his mind. Any suggestion?
