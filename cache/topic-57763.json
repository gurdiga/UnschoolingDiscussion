I know this isn&#39;t true for everyone, but maybe it is generally true. Maybe more boys are kinesthetic learners.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLori, how is your son doing? Is he starting to show specific interests yet? My daughter does, but my son really hasn&#39;t yet. Maybe because I am still in the habit of looking for &quot;school interests&quot;. I think he is just having a good time being his own boss. When he was in school (K-2), he used to be so happy to be able to come home and do his own thing. The only thing is that it was always shortly bedtime to him, because he had to get up the next day, and he didn&#39;t have enough of &quot;his time&quot; that he needed. He would tire of things like Boy Scouts because he would get into doing his own thing at home and it was time to leave again. He really enjoys just being home. I think he would probably be called an introvert whereas his sister is definitely an extrovert.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-OlifGet more from the Web.
