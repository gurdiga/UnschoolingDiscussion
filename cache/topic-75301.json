They have had colds or flu once or twice a year and have been healed with the help of homeopathy.  I do think diet is a huge part of their healthy bodies and I would strongly suggest only eating organic, hormone free milk.  It doesn&#39;t taste different.  If anything it is better tasting.  Also, organic berries and grapes are really essential if you can&#39;t do it all organically. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy DH had terrible eczema as a child and his mother turned to homeopathy and organic food as a result of the regular Dr.s prescriptions not working in any lasting way.  If you use the cortisone or other medical creams then the toxins can&#39;t come out of the body and will eventually have to produce the eczema or other disease again.  A rash is the body&#39;s way of eliminating toxins.

This term encompasses <br/>\n&gt; a multitude of materials that function as emulsifiers, dispersants, <br/>\n&gt; oil-wetters, water-wetters, foamers and defoamers. The type of <br/>\n&gt; surfactant behavior, whether acting as an emulsifier or dispersant or <br/>\n&gt; otherwise, depends on the structural groups on the molecule (or <br/>\n&gt; mixture of molecules). Hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) number helps <br/>\n&gt; define the function that a molecular group will perform.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cleansinfg detergents have a high lipophile number; meaning that they <br/>\nwill attract more oil --in order to give you that squeaky clean <br/>\nfeeling-- than a hydrophilic surfactant (ie: moisturizer). That&#39;s <br/>\nanything with Sodium Lauryl or Laureth Sulfate is not good for <br/>\nsensitive, dry or eczema skin. Glycerin is a natural HYDROPHILIC <br/>\nsurfactant and so, the higher it is in the list of ingredients in a <br/>\nlotion, the better it is for your skin. Another route is the oils route <br/>\n--basically do what the ancients (was it the Greeks?) did before soap <br/>\nwas invented --use oil for daily cleansing and either salt or ground <br/>\nrice or nutshells for mild exfoliation (and &#39;deeper&#39; cleaning).<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked at Colgate-Palmolive for 4 years writing a reference manual <br/>\nwith loads of stuff like this for the Consumer Affairs department.

It ended up being multiple food allergies-<br/>\n  -<br/>\n  &gt;   dairy, <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   wheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies <br/>\n  &gt;   than <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   that <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   but we stopped testing after those because eliminating <br/>\n  those <br/>\n  &gt;   from <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   his <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   diet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   eliminated <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   night terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and <br/>\n  &gt;   crying <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   in <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   the middle of the night without ever completely waking <br/>\n  up, <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   difficult <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   to calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a <br/>\n  baby <br/>\n  &gt;   (I <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   nursed <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   him, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I <br/>\n  &gt;   consumed <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   that <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   got passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I <br/>\n  would <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   have <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   known that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   When we had the food testing done we had emla cream put <br/>\n  on <br/>\n  &gt;   his <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   arm, <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   which numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so <br/>\n  &gt;   much.  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   They <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   only tested for one food at a time which my allergist <br/>\n  &gt;   believed <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   was a <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   more accurate way of doing it.  His little arm would <br/>\n  swell so <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   much in <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   reaction to each of the foods that they couldn&#39;t test for <br/>\n  &gt;   very <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   many <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   foods at a time.<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   As he got older (4-5 years old), he started having near-<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   anaphylactic <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   reactions when he ate certain foods.  Once I felt bad <br/>\n  that he <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   couldn&#39;t have goodies at a family gathering and let him <br/>\n  have <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   birthday <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   cake and shrimp fried in butter on the same day.  His <br/>\n  throat <br/>\n  &gt;   and <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   lips <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   swelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his <br/>\n  &gt;   face.  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   I <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   think benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was <br/>\n  very <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   close <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   to calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, <br/>\n  &gt;   once <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   when <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   he ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he <br/>\n  was <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   allergic to canteloupe.  These episodes started getting <br/>\n  more <br/>\n  &gt;   and <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   more <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   frequent, which was getting scary because if he ate the <br/>\n  wrong <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   food <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   and I didn&#39;t know it, it could be life-threatening!  I <br/>\n  worked <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   hard to <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   make sure his diet was wheat-free and dairy-free without <br/>\n  him <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   feeling <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   hurt emotionally over it.  That meant I baked special <br/>\n  cake <br/>\n  &gt;   before <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   we <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   went to birthday parties, had special cookies on hand to <br/>\n  take <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   with us <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   when we went places, I spent tons of money on wheat-free, <br/>\n  &gt;   dairy-<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   free <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   products that look like what everyone else was eating, <br/>\n  etc.  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Sometimes well-meaning people would give him something <br/>\n  &gt;   without my <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   knowledge either because they didn&#39;t believe in food <br/>\n  &gt;   allergies or <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   out <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   of ignorance.  (Oh, do graham crackers have wheat in <br/>\n  them?  I <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   thought <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   they just had graham in them!  duh!)  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him <br/>\n  of <br/>\n  &gt;   his <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   food <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being <br/>\n  &gt;   able to <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   breathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being <br/>\n  able to <br/>\n  &gt;   eat <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   anything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to <br/>\n  turn <br/>\n  &gt;   six <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   now, and he&#39;s still eating everything.  No exzema, no <br/>\n  night <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   terrors, <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   no hives, no breathing episodes.  I highly recommend <br/>\n  seeing a <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   classical homeopath to be treated constitutionally for <br/>\n  food <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   allergies-<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   -we had tremendous results!  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Sheila<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, <br/>\n  &gt;   sharonashleigh@w... <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hi!

Still, it wasn&#39;t an easy decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: OT--allergy testing for eczema","postDate":"1056463637","msgId":75317,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTkwMWMzM2E1OSRlYmMwODkzMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PGJkOWxkNys3MHNnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":75314,"nextInTopic":75320,"prevInTime":75316,"nextInTime":75318,"topicId":75301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We use Shea Butter to treat our drums.

He would <br/>\n  &gt;   sometimes <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   have blood on the sheets in the morning because he would <br/>\n  scratch <br/>\n  &gt;   it <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   open at night.  It ended up being multiple food allergies--<br/>\n  dairy, <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   wheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies <br/>\n  than <br/>\n  &gt;   that <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   but we stopped testing after those because eliminating those <br/>\n  from <br/>\n  &gt;   his <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   diet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also <br/>\n  &gt;   eliminated <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   night terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and <br/>\n  crying <br/>\n  &gt;   in <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   the middle of the night without ever completely waking up, <br/>\n  &gt;   difficult <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   to calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a baby <br/>\n  (I <br/>\n  &gt;   nursed <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   him, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I <br/>\n  consumed <br/>\n  &gt;   that <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   got passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I would <br/>\n  &gt;   have <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   known that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   When we had the food testing done we had emla cream put on <br/>\n  his <br/>\n  &gt;   arm, <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   which numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so <br/>\n  much.  <br/>\n  &gt;   They <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   only tested for one food at a time which my allergist <br/>\n  believed <br/>\n  &gt;   was a <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   more accurate way of doing it.  His little arm would swell so <br/>\n  &gt;   much in <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   reaction to each of the foods that they couldn&#39;t test for <br/>\n  very <br/>\n  &gt;   many <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   foods at a time.<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   As he got older (4-5 years old), he started having near-<br/>\n  &gt;   anaphylactic <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   reactions when he ate certain foods.  Once I felt bad that he <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   couldn&#39;t have goodies at a family gathering and let him have <br/>\n  &gt;   birthday <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   cake and shrimp fried in butter on the same day.  His throat <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt;   lips <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   swelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his <br/>\n  face.  <br/>\n  &gt;   I <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   think benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was very <br/>\n  &gt;   close <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   to calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, <br/>\n  once <br/>\n  &gt;   when <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   he ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he was <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   allergic to canteloupe.  These episodes started getting more <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt;   more <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   frequent, which was getting scary because if he ate the wrong <br/>\n  &gt;   food <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   and I didn&#39;t know it, it could be life-threatening!  I worked <br/>\n  &gt;   hard to <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   make sure his diet was wheat-free and dairy-free without him <br/>\n  &gt;   feeling <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   hurt emotionally over it.  That meant I baked special cake <br/>\n  before <br/>\n  &gt;   we <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   went to birthday parties, had special cookies on hand to take <br/>\n  &gt;   with us <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   when we went places, I spent tons of money on wheat-free, <br/>\n  dairy-<br/>\n  &gt;   free <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   products that look like what everyone else was eating, etc.  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   Sometimes well-meaning people would give him something <br/>\n  without my <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   knowledge either because they didn&#39;t believe in food <br/>\n  allergies or <br/>\n  &gt;   out <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   of ignorance.  (Oh, do graham crackers have wheat in them?  I <br/>\n  &gt;   thought <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   they just had graham in them!  duh!)  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him of <br/>\n  his <br/>\n  &gt;   food <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being <br/>\n  able to <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   breathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being able to <br/>\n  eat <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   anything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to turn <br/>\n  six <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   now, and he&#39;s still eating everything.  No exzema, no night <br/>\n  &gt;   terrors, <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   no hives, no breathing episodes.  I highly recommend seeing a <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   classical homeopath to be treated constitutionally for food <br/>\n  &gt;   allergies-<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   -we had tremendous results!  <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   Sheila<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, <br/>\n  sharonashleigh@w... <br/>\n  &gt;   wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hi!

He would <br/>\n  sometimes <br/>\n  &gt;   have blood on the sheets in the morning because he would scratch <br/>\n  it <br/>\n  &gt;   open at night.  It ended up being multiple food allergies--dairy, <br/>\n  &gt;   wheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies than <br/>\n  that <br/>\n  &gt;   but we stopped testing after those because eliminating those from <br/>\n  his <br/>\n  &gt;   diet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also <br/>\n  eliminated <br/>\n  &gt;   night terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and crying <br/>\n  in <br/>\n  &gt;   the middle of the night without ever completely waking up, <br/>\n  difficult <br/>\n  &gt;   to calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a baby (I <br/>\n  nursed <br/>\n  &gt;   him, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I consumed <br/>\n  that <br/>\n  &gt;   got passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I would <br/>\n  have <br/>\n  &gt;   known that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;   When we had the food testing done we had emla cream put on his <br/>\n  arm, <br/>\n  &gt;   which numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so much.  <br/>\n  They <br/>\n  &gt;   only tested for one food at a time which my allergist believed <br/>\n  was a <br/>\n  &gt;   more accurate way of doing it.

His throat and <br/>\n  lips <br/>\n  &gt;   swelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his face.  <br/>\n  I <br/>\n  &gt;   think benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was very <br/>\n  close <br/>\n  &gt;   to calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, once <br/>\n  when <br/>\n  &gt;   he ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he was <br/>\n  &gt;   allergic to canteloupe.

He would sometimes <br/>\nhave blood on the sheets in the morning because he would scratch it <br/>\nopen at night.  It ended up being multiple food allergies--dairy, <br/>\nwheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies than that <br/>\nbut we stopped testing after those because eliminating those from his <br/>\ndiet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also eliminated <br/>\nnight terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and crying in <br/>\nthe middle of the night without ever completely waking up, difficult <br/>\nto calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a baby (I nursed <br/>\nhim, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I consumed that <br/>\ngot passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I would have <br/>\nknown that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we had the food testing done we had emla cream put on his arm, <br/>\nwhich numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so much.  They <br/>\nonly tested for one food at a time which my allergist believed was a <br/>\nmore accurate way of doing it.  His little arm would swell so much in <br/>\nreaction to each of the foods that they couldn&#39;t test for very many <br/>\nfoods at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he got older (4-5 years old), he started having near-anaphylactic <br/>\nreactions when he ate certain foods.  Once I felt bad that he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have goodies at a family gathering and let him have birthday <br/>\ncake and shrimp fried in butter on the same day.  His throat and lips <br/>\nswelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his face.  I <br/>\nthink benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was very close <br/>\nto calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, once when <br/>\nhe ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he was <br/>\nallergic to canteloupe.  These episodes started getting more and more <br/>\nfrequent, which was getting scary because if he ate the wrong food <br/>\nand I didn&#39;t know it, it could be life-threatening!  I worked hard to <br/>\nmake sure his diet was wheat-free and dairy-free without him feeling <br/>\nhurt emotionally over it.  That meant I baked special cake before we <br/>\nwent to birthday parties, had special cookies on hand to take with us <br/>\nwhen we went places, I spent tons of money on wheat-free, dairy-free <br/>\nproducts that look like what everyone else was eating, etc.  <br/>\nSometimes well-meaning people would give him something without my <br/>\nknowledge either because they didn&#39;t believe in food allergies or out <br/>\nof ignorance.  (Oh, do graham crackers have wheat in them?  I thought <br/>\nthey just had graham in them!  duh!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him of his food <br/>\nallergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being able to <br/>\nbreathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being able to eat <br/>\nanything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to turn six <br/>\nnow, and he&#39;s still eating everything.  No exzema, no night terrors, <br/>\nno hives, no breathing episodes.  I highly recommend seeing a <br/>\nclassical homeopath to be treated constitutionally for food allergies-<br/>\n-we had tremendous results!  <br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, sharonashleigh@w... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi!
