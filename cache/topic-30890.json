I was the one who wrote it and the reason I added it, was to give examples of children who watch TV all the time.  I am just learning about unschooling and that is why I am following this list so all of your input helps expand my narrow view.  I have never ever met a homeschooled child(except my own - just started in September) or family let alone an unschooled child.  Sarah and others have brought up the fact that respect for children as equals is very important.  I strongly agree!  Sarah also said that possibly the fact that the two children I mentioned are ps kids has a lot to do with why they veg in front of the TV a lot.  I have no way of knowing.  I am a keen observer of parenting styles, I look at what works, what doesn&#39;t and try to figure out why.  I think you hit the nail on the head when you said my nephew doesn&#39;t feel needed or capable and your reasons make a lot of sense.  Your description of an unschooling family is certainly one I aspire to have.  Posts like yours go a long way in helping me attain my goal.
