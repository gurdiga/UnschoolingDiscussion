It isn&#39;t important that we acknowledge our parenting mistakes to <br/>\nothers here, unless, of course, we choose to do so.  What IS so vitally <br/>\nimportant is that we admit our mistakes to ourselves and our children and <br/>\nmake every effort to learn and recover from those mistakes.

Both of my<br/>\nkids have loved that book, and we lost my grandmother this month.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a gut feeling I have that says that at early ages, kids know<br/>\ninstinctively, perhaps from memory before being born, that dying is okay. My<br/>\ndaughter came in and announced yesterday &quot;When I get really, really old and<br/>\ndie, I want my body burned up so it can help some trees grow.&quot;. There was no<br/>\nfear in that statement (she&#39;s 3). Obviously, we&#39;ve talked a bit about what<br/>\nhappened to grandma&#39;s body (cremation) lately.<br/>\nI&#39;ve written before on this list about how both of my kids have told me<br/>\n(each at the age of two) of their memories of hovering over DH&#39;s and my<br/>\nwedding. I&#39;m fairly sure that there&#39;s no way they could&#39;ve made that up.<br/>\nNeither of them had even seen a picture of our wedding at the age they told<br/>\nme these things. I have a feeling that&#39;s one reason why they were not afraid<br/>\nof death at those ages.<br/>\nBy the age of 10, however, kids are pretty fully incarnated in this world,<br/>\nand the tenuous connections that they might&#39;ve had with whatever other realm<br/>\nthey came from must be thin or gone by about that age. Then they start to<br/>\nrealize their mortality, and since they don&#39;t have the younger child&#39;s<br/>\ninnate sense of peace about it, they feel fear. 10 is also the age when most<br/>\nkids become very, very cognizant of their bodies. I doubt that this is a<br/>\ncoincidence.<br/>\nIf it was my kids, I guess I would re-tell them the stories they told me as<br/>\ntoddlers about having chosen to come down to life on this earth with DH and<br/>\nI. I would think that it would give them some comfort to know that they came<br/>\nfrom someplace else that they were not scared of at the time. With older<br/>\nkids, I might even read some life-after-death books such as &quot;Embraced by the<br/>\nLight&quot;. I know some people believe that those accounts are hokey, and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t say that I agree with every interpretation that&#39;s been put on the<br/>\nafterlife, but there certainly is something compelling in knowing that<br/>\npeople who have died for brief periods of time almost universally come back<br/>\nwith no fear of death and with only joyous stories of what lies beyond.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: fear of death","postDate":"1053100577","msgId":69383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjM2WHF4c0QxVHk5Q00wMDAyYjM1ZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69382,"nextInTopic":69389,"prevInTime":69382,"nextInTime":69384,"topicId":69320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My children have been going through this as well.

I would also like help with this one.  I remember being exactly<br/>\n10 and having an uncontrollable fear of death come over me like a tidal wave<br/>\n  I remember thinking that when I got old, I might be all alone, and then<br/>\ndie alone.  My mother just told me I was being silly.  So, you can pretty<br/>\nmuch guess I didn&#39;t bring it up again.  I don&#39;t remember how long it lasted<br/>\nor how I got through it.  My own 10 year old ( to be May 31) has expressed<br/>\nthis same feeling to me a couple of times over the last couple of years.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what sparks it, she doesn&#39;t either.  I have no idea what to say<br/>\nto her, I don&#39;t know that there IS anything to say to her.  All I&#39;ve done is<br/>\nhold her and let her cry, tell her about my same feelings when I was young,<br/>\nand after a while, she says &quot;Thanks Mom&quot; and seems to be okay.  I hope<br/>\nsomeone has some wonderful insight on this.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\ntammy t\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 15, 2003 23:12:03\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] fear of death\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nDo any of you have any insight as far as how to help a child (age\r<br/>\n10) who is intensely afraid of dying?

It&#39;s comforting <br/>\nwithout being in any particular religious tradition.  A woman is grieving her <br/>\nhusband/partner&#39;s death, and he returns.  I really liked it.  It was <br/>\noriginal, and touching.  Holly was able to watch it, but in parts, not all at <br/>\nonce (because it&#39;s a little slow).   Maybe it&#39;s too much talking for some <br/>\npeople&#39;s tastes, and there is some implied sex (I don&#39;t remember nudity, but <br/>\nthen I wouldn&#39;t).  There&#39;s also music, and that&#39;s great.  And there&#39;s humor.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Cure&quot; is a kid buddy-movie/adventure about a boy with AIDS and his next <br/>\ndoor neighbor who comes to like him and decides to &quot;scientifically&quot; find a <br/>\ncure for AIDS for him.  And they go on an adventure to find an AIDS doctor in <br/>\nNew Orleans (by starting in a stream in Minnesota or somewhere far north <br/>\nwhere the Mississippi is small, and they have adventures on the way).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that would be comforting.  Might NOT be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly couldn&#39;t think of anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t much help, but might be up the road some.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"fear of death","postDate":"1053058318","msgId":69320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhMW9lZStpbjl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69323,"prevInTime":69319,"nextInTime":69321,"topicId":69320,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do any of you have any insight as far as how to help a child (age 10) who is intensely afraid of dying?
