She then went to public school until the <br/>\nend of 1st grade. We schooled at home (we are just now turning to <br/>\nunschooling) and she STILL didn&#39;t read fluently until she was 9! At <br/>\n9 she could read whatever she wanted and she tested above grade <br/>\nlevel on her first state mandated test after third grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for socialization: Wills, my almost 13 ds, was also in the above <br/>\nsituation. Day care, preschool, kindergarten, public schooled until <br/>\nthe end of 2nd grade. He has always been a square peg in a round <br/>\nhole, but not because he was homeschooled! The experts had him for <br/>\nall those years and couldn&#39;t make him fit (thank God!). <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter four years of home schooling (which has not been unschooling, <br/>\nbut has been fairly relaxed) Naomi does not love to read, but she <br/>\ncan read whatever she needs/wants to read. She reads well and with <br/>\nexcellent comprehension. Wills no longer seems like a round peg, now <br/>\nthat he can choose his own companions. He is comfortable in any <br/>\nsituation and makes friends *everywhere*. At the store he talks to <br/>\nthe kids in the toy aisle and is well known by the clerks in home <br/>\nelectronics. While waiting for us to check into a hotel he <br/>\nbefriended the security guard and the bellman who took up our bags. <br/>\nHe also learned the history of the hotel and had a list of fun <br/>\nthings we could do in the surrounding area. While watching fireworks <br/>\nthe other night I was amazed once again at how kids of all ages <br/>\ngravitate toward him. He kept them so entertained with his <br/>\nimpressions that they missed the fireworks finale!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I&#39;ve been reading about unschooling and all the posts here, I <br/>\nkeep thinking, &quot;My kids have come so far since their institutional <br/>\ndays. How far might they go if truly left to themselves?&quot; I can&#39;t <br/>\nwait to see! <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in Oregon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76219,"nextTopicId":76244}}
