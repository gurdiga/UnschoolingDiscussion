Right now chess, drawing, dancing, biking. I&#39;m learning piano. I<br/>\npractice a lot, I wish more. When I practice, I have to share the piano with<br/>\neveryone because they all want to try a new piece or show me what they know.<br/>\nThe piano sat quiet for 6 months or more until I started taking a 20 minute 1<br/>\ntime a week lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome weeks I plan a lot, usually outings, to the zoo, a walk, a play, a lunch<br/>\nat a resturant, a play date. Other weeks are completely freeform. We may still<br/>\ngo to the zoo, or a play, yet more spontaneous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids get cranky, agitated, I usually try to connect with themm.<br/>\nCooking is great, they actually need me to assist. We make fun stuff,<br/>\nplaydough, bread, soups. We garden, or use a real tool, like a drill, or saw,<br/>\nor hammer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchoolish type work happend around our house because kids around here go to<br/>\nschool. They write, or do spelling tests, always asked. My son, also 5 likes<br/>\nadding problemsd. I write up a sheet and he does the math. He likes these like<br/>\nchess and biking. Something we do together. Time to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48998,"nextTopicId":48971}}
