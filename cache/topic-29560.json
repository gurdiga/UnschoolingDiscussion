Thank","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-217820398\">Oh, I don&#39;t believe that hogwash that there HAS to be consistency in how <br/>\n2 parents raise their children.  I am very unschoolish, but my husband <br/>\nis not.  Thank goodness he&#39;s not nearly as controlling and conservative <br/>\nas he used to be.  I credit myself.  He learns from my modeling just as <br/>\nwell as my boys do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK.  I&#39;ll just come right out and say it:  My boys know what they can <br/>\nget away with when they are with me (almost anything!) and they know <br/>\nthat they can&#39;t do all those things when Papa is around.  They make the <br/>\nadjustments very well and I don&#39;t particularly think it is harmful.  It <br/>\nis just real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly wish he had the same philosophy I have, but he doesn&#39;t.  We make <br/>\nour compromises and we are happy.  The boys are very happy too.  <br/>\nChildren are very smart, and they will adjust to different personalities <br/>\nand parenting styles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI refuse to give up my unschooling practices and my husband knows this.  <br/>\nI am happy to say he has made more changes than I have.  He&#39;s come more <br/>\nto my side than I have come to his.  Actually, I have not moved in his <br/>\ndirection at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has learned a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Friday, December 7, 2001, at 07:10 AM, Joseph Fuerst wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Oh Dar.
