And don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; mellowed with time. But this list is about *supporting* unschooling,<br/>\n&gt; and while we do encourage wandering off that topic, we don&#39;t need to<br/>\n&gt; turn this into the Unschoolers Against Public Schooling list. Thanks<br/>\n&gt; for understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At Home Education Magazine we&#39;ve always tried to take a generally<br/>\n&gt; positive approach to homeschooling and unschooling, helping people<br/>\n&gt; find alternatives when they&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to go seeking, but<br/>\n&gt; not going out of our way to convince people that they&#39;re doing the<br/>\n&gt; wrong thing and need to change (well, with one significant<br/>\n&gt; politically-charged exception &lt;g&gt;). We quite regularly reject<br/>\n&gt; articles badmouthing schools and teachers and the whole educational<br/>\n&gt; bureaucracy, not because we want to promote the schooling experience<br/>\n&gt; (*far* from it, trust me), but because it just doesn&#39;t make any sense<br/>\n&gt; to us to try to build up what we believe in, what we trust and rely<br/>\n&gt; on, by tearing down what other people might believe in and trust and<br/>\n&gt; rely on.

You have a great deal useful to say about<br/>\n*unschooling* which is what people signed onto the list for.
