I just wanted to share something happy, but heartbreaking. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We literally LEAPED into radical unschooling this past October. Before that <br/>\n  we did school-at-home, but in a very relaxed way. My now 10yos went to school <br/>\n  for Kindergarten and it was a NIGHTMARE!! My now 13yos went up through 3rd <br/>\n  grade. Then we pulled them out of school. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Yesterday my 10yos and I were cuddling on my bed, just talking about <br/>\n  everything and he got very quiet. Suddenly he took my hand and said, &quot;Mom, <br/>\n  there is something I want to tell you.&quot; I said, &quot;Ok, what is it?&quot; He said <br/>\n  that when we began homeschooling that he HATED it as much as school, but he <br/>\n  never wanted to tell me because he didn&#39;t want to hurt me. He said he used to <br/>\n  sit and listen to me teach and hope that I would be finished, but then I&#39;d <br/>\n  tell him it was time to do something else...It just broke my heart!!! We did <br/>\n  this for 3 years before I just QUIT!! It hurts me that I made them suffer for <br/>\n  three years like that!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n  I told him that the truth was, I hated it, too. And I was glad that he told <br/>\n  me! I told him that I was sorry that I did that to him. He told me that he <br/>\n  loves his life now and he loves that he can do what he wants - then went on <br/>\n  to list all the wonderful, real-life things he is doing. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I felt honored and privileged to listen to him speak. I am SOOOOO thankful <br/>\n  for this message board and for all of your honesty and truth. I wish I could <br/>\n  take back those three years and all the years before and do it all <br/>\n  differently. I wish I could have given this kind of life to my two adult <br/>\n  children (18ds and 21dd). Fortunately, they still live at home and are <br/>\n  experiencing this unschooling life with us. What my 10ds said to me just <br/>\n  reinforces how RIGHT this is and we will look forward from here. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We LOVE our lives right now! Each day is truly and adventure and a place of <br/>\n  peace and security for my children now. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope that those who are new to this board will read everything here with an <br/>\n  open heart and mind; do not pass judgement without thinking about WHY you <br/>\n  feel the way you do about something said here.
