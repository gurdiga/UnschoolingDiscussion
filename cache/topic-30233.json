Personally I <br/>\n  like to point out all the people that die from the vaccines. I also point <br/>\n  out that each cost of a vaccine has a percentage that goes into a fund <br/>\n  for restitution to the parents of the children that die from it (although <br/>\n  many parents can&#39;t claim it since its very hard for them to prove it was <br/>\n  vaccine related death.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I also point out that all the cases of disease that are caused by <br/>\n  vaccines (the only Polio cases that exists in the world today are from <br/>\n  vaccinations) and back when I had money *laugh* I used to send them one <br/>\n  of Neil Zimmer&#39;s books on vaccinations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When pushed in conversation, I also point out how vaccines don&#39;t keep <br/>\n  kids safe, they just keep the symptoms from showing. Their poor little <br/>\n  bodies stop fighting and it turns into something a lot nastier sooner or <br/>\n  later in life. I&#39;m sure a lot of ADD is from vaccination poisoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for helping to support a movement to keep our children safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  kolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n  btw: this is a tough issue because there are one or two vaccines that are <br/>\n  safe. For example there is a company that makes a great tetanus vaccine <br/>\n  (I can get the name if anyone is interested). YET some states require <br/>\n  either a)religious b) medical. Very few states also allow c) conscious <br/>\n  choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This puts parents at a disadvantage that want to vaccinate for one (lets <br/>\n  say at the age of 5 for tetanus only) and not for any others. Which means <br/>\n  parents then have to go &#39;underground&#39; to make their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tis a sad thing in my heart that our children are not our children when <br/>\n  it comes to things like this, yet something like spanking is legal. Oh, <br/>\n  I&#39;ll never understand it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
