I&#39;m glad that some of the suggestions there have helped you and that you are starting to relax and calm down about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve probably already heard about or read this book, but just in case, have you or your daugther read<br/>\nThe Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education (1998 edition) by Grace Llewellyn? That is one to read especially for teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout your husband, it sounds like he is much more hesitant about unschooling than you are. If you are truly unschooling, your daughter should be able to focus learning about things that really interest her. You and your dh should not worry so much about covering the basics so she can get into college. The right approach would be to listen to and allow your daughter to pursue what she loves. At some point she may be able to find a job or volunteer in the area she&#39;s interested in. If SHE really wants to go to college, she can start taking college courses even before she has &quot;graduated&quot; from high school, if that&#39;s something you all agree upon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not talking from experience, however, this is just what I have read about how to handle unschooling high school. In fact, I think there is a recent thread started at unschooling.com about that very subject. But, those teen years will be here before I know it, for my boys, and reading other&#39;s experiences about unschooling high school and entering college/universities is putting my mind at ease for the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe there are others here with current unschooling highschool experience that will answer your questions more directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all,<br/>\n      It&#39;s Janice, I wrote awhile back, many of you posted some very <br/>\n  helpful advice at the Unschooling Message board, when I told about my <br/>\n  challenge of &#39;trying&#39; to home or un school at the same time.  I put <br/>\n  it under What&#39;s on Your Mind, and my subject was: Trying to get back <br/>\n  into the unswing of thing.  Anyway, I wanted to thank you who cared <br/>\n  enough to help me, and I must say, that I have since taken a lot of <br/>\n  the advice I received, and have &#39;calmed&#39; down in a sense, so that <br/>\n  more of our days are relaxed, unpressured, but productive in some <br/>\n  small way.  I don&#39;t put grades down anymore, but I do check what they <br/>\n  do in their workbooks, if that&#39;s the case.  We go to the library, and <br/>\n  they pick out books on subjects they are truly interested in, and <br/>\n  it&#39;s amazing to see how much they are really loving &#39;learning&#39;.  I <br/>\n  don&#39;t feel so stressed, and neither do they.  We begin our day with <br/>\n  prayer, and we talk for about half an hour about what some of our <br/>\n  goals for the week might be, and then we just do what comes natural.  <br/>\n  It&#39;s a little hard to feel totally unguilty about this, but I AM <br/>\n  going to get there! <br/>\n<br/>\n       My daughter, Heather, will technically be started &quot;high&quot; school <br/>\n  in September, and while I am not opposed to continuing teaching her <br/>\n  at home, my husband has some doubts, especially since these years <br/>\n  lead up to college, and so on and so forth.

I put <br/>\nit under What&#39;s on Your Mind, and my subject was: Trying to get back <br/>\ninto the unswing of thing.  Anyway, I wanted to thank you who cared <br/>\nenough to help me, and I must say, that I have since taken a lot of <br/>\nthe advice I received, and have &#39;calmed&#39; down in a sense, so that <br/>\nmore of our days are relaxed, unpressured, but productive in some <br/>\nsmall way.  I don&#39;t put grades down anymore, but I do check what they <br/>\ndo in their workbooks, if that&#39;s the case.  We go to the library, and <br/>\nthey pick out books on subjects they are truly interested in, and <br/>\nit&#39;s amazing to see how much they are really loving &#39;learning&#39;.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel so stressed, and neither do they.  We begin our day with <br/>\nprayer, and we talk for about half an hour about what some of our <br/>\ngoals for the week might be, and then we just do what comes natural.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a little hard to feel totally unguilty about this, but I AM <br/>\ngoing to get there! <br/>\n<br/>\n     My daughter, Heather, will technically be started &quot;high&quot; school <br/>\nin September, and while I am not opposed to continuing teaching her <br/>\nat home, my husband has some doubts, especially since these years <br/>\nlead up to college, and so on and so forth.  I would truly appreciate <br/>\nyour suggestions, or ideas on what would be a good approach at this <br/>\npoint, because I really want to do the right thing.  I thank you <br/>\nagain, and will look forward to hearing from you.   Janice</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31285,"nextTopicId":31292}}
