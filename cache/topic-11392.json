Now I know why-your story sounds so much like <br/>\nmine!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest boy was much the same-in the 5th grade at ps, my first parent <br/>\nteacher conference had 2 teachers and the principal present to confront me <br/>\nabout how Rick was getting no score lower than a 95 from tests and classroom <br/>\nwork, but when they averaged in the homework that never seemed to make it to <br/>\nclass (although I was wasting all of our evenings making him do it) he was <br/>\ngetting D&#39;s. One teacher actually cried and said &quot;I&#39;m just afraid he&#39;s not <br/>\ngetting the practice he needs&quot;. Excuse me, but if you can get a 98 without <br/>\nhomework, why do you need it?<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic school took up our entire lives, it seemed. If they weren&#39;t at <br/>\nschool, then they were doing homework or getting ready for school. Not to <br/>\nmention all the times I had to race 20 miles to town to get something that <br/>\nthey just had to have for school tomorrow. Absentee policy was also a <br/>\nproblem for me, as the school and I disagreed on the importance of just <br/>\ntaking a day off to have some quality time alone with your mom. Now, where I <br/>\nlive, parents are even being taken to court and fined for school <br/>\nabsences-its a good thing we got out when we did!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour younger son sounds alot like mine-I call him an unschoolers dream <br/>\nchild! He only went to ps for k and 1st grade, not enough to rob him of his <br/>\ninnate capacity to learn naturally-just because he wants to know. He also <br/>\nwas late to ride a bike! He reads alot, has fun with numbers, remembers how <br/>\nto spell words easily, and is happy and free to be himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still worry that they are not doing enough actual school work sometimes, <br/>\nthat they will never learn to write, as it is something that the boys never <br/>\nseem to want to do. I still hold out hope that when they get a bit older and <br/>\nwant to meet more kids on the net they will need to communicate in writing <br/>\nand will then learn it-as everything else, when they decide they need to <br/>\nknow, they will learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do quite a bit of running around, there are alot of hsers in our area, <br/>\nand many opportunities for classes and group activities. I also work 4 days <br/>\na week, so although I certainly do not envy your illness, I would like more <br/>\ntime to just talk as it seems to be our best learning time also. The years <br/>\nwhen they were little and I stayed home were so full of joy for us all. Then <br/>\nwe may have only gone to town once a week-now it seems I am driving all the <br/>\ntime. I am trying to wean us all off of the constant running so that I can <br/>\ndrop at least one more day of work. But as soon as I think that, I get an <br/>\nemail about gym day and think, Oh, wouldn&#39;t that be fun! (I am still trying <br/>\nto decide on that one)<br/>\n<br/>\nI love hearing about your oldest son. It is so reassuring to know that it <br/>\npays off and I think about these kids often when I have my doubtful days.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11409,"nextTopicId":11423}}
