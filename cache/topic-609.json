Mr. Berry feels<br/>\nhomeschooling should not be legal - and his view of homeschoolers is<br/>\nunfortunately as limited and uninformed as that of many of our<br/>\nlegislators.  We need better - and more accurate publicity!<br/>\n<br/>\nA suggestion to anyone interested in responding to Jeff Berry: flaming<br/>\nhim back will not accomplish much - educating him might.  As with any<br/>\nlobbying attempts or letters to legislators, thoughtful, polite and<br/>\nreasonable communications accomplish far more in the long run.  Now take<br/>\na deep breath, calm yourself - and check out the article.<br/>\nMiranda (Paymer)<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nStop home schooling<br/>\nBy Jeff Berry<br/>\nSpecial class: Ignorance & paranoia 101<br/>\n<br/>\n   Many of you may not know that in addition to being a fabulously<br/>\ntalented writer, I am also a lawyer, brain surgeon and architect.<br/>\n   I did not go to college to obtain my lofty degrees. I didn&#39;t have to.<br/>\nUsing the logic of a burgeoning conservative movement in this country, I<br/>\nhome-schooled myself in these disciplines and awarded myself the<br/>\ndiplomas. I was an excellent student, with a perfect 4.0 grade-point<br/>\naverage. I graduated at the top of my class.<br/>\n   And by schooling myself at home instead of at some pointy-headed<br/>\n&quot;university, &quot; I was kept safe from the twin evils of liberal elitism and<br/>\ngodless secular humanism.<br/>\n   Throughout America, it has become rather fashionable among the<br/>\nconservative kook set to withhold children from public and private<br/>\neducational institutions in order to &quot;school&quot; them at home. To hear them<br/>\ntell it, they have all had great success with their youngsters, who are<br/>\ninsulated in a loving home far away from gangs, violence and people of<br/>\nother races.<br/>\n  \tYes indeed, conservative stay-at-home moms with high school educations<br/>\nall over the nation are instructing their children in such advanced<br/>\nacademic pursuits as laundry folding, soap-opera watching and house<br/>\ncleaning -- the skills every child needs to succeed.<br/>\n  \tOh sure, Mom occasionally refers the kids to some printed material<br/>\nwritten by a TV evangelist that is supposed to serve as the child&#39;s<br/>\nhome-school &quot;curriculum,&quot; but that&#39;s usually only a momentary distraction<br/>\nfrom the day&#39;s home-school schedule. The core of their academic day --<br/>\nconsisting mainly of shopping, telephone calls, and television -- is<br/>\nrarely interrupted with an attempt at actual &quot;instruction.&quot;<br/>\n  \tThese parents believe that every school is a hopeless drug-infested<br/>\nwasteland. In their minds, they are simply exercising the essence of<br/>\nfreedom -- which is to &quot;school&quot; their children at home, far from the<br/>\ncorrupting influences of teachers with college &quot;degrees&quot; and people whose<br/>\nreligion, race or political ideology may be different from their own.<br/>\n   But to my mind, they are guilty of aggravated child abuse.<br/>\n  \tRemoving a child from school is to reject the very basis of human<br/>\nintelligence in an enlightened society. It prevents children from<br/>\nacquiring passable social skills, it deprives them of the opportunity to<br/>\nforge lasting personal relationships, and it causes ignorance and<br/>\noutright stupidity on a grand scale. Home schooling creates an atmosphere<br/>\nof insular paranoia that breeds intolerance and suspicion of people who<br/>\nare different.<br/>\n  \tBut hey, if our culture is willing to allow children to obtain a high<br/>\nschool equivalency certificate even though they have never set foot in a<br/>\nchoolhouse, why can&#39;t I home-school myself in the advanced sciences,<br/>\nsuch as medicine or law? What liberal tyrant would deprive me of that<br/>\nGod-given right?<br/>\n  \tConservatives often use 1950s America as an example of the cultural<br/>\nmorality to which all Americans should adhere. But in the 1950s, refusing<br/>\nto send your child to school would have gotten a parent tossed in jail,<br/>\nand the child charged with truancy.<br/>\n  \tAn Internet search on the subject of home schooling clearly reveals<br/>\nthat the  phenomenon is being perpetuated by a host of societal misfits,<br/>\nfringe political activists and fundamentalist religious zealots. Such<br/>\npeople are extremely hostile to any assault upon what they believe to be<br/>\ntheir Constitutional right to deprive their children of an education. As<br/>\none home &quot;schooling&quot; parent asked me, &quot;Why are you so concerned about how<br/>\nother people elect to educate their kids, Mr. Berry?&quot;<br/>\n\t  &quot;It&#39;s Doctor Berry,&quot; I replied. &quot;And home schooling is nothing but<br/>\nparentally sanctioned truancy. It should be outlawed.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":472,"nextTopicId":597}}
