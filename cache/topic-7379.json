My 2yo now is very <br/>\nindependent and will sit and draw with markers in her high chair or play peg <br/>\nboard or doll house for an hour or so without any assistance.  My 4 1/2 yo, <br/>\notoh, needs constant assistance from me to pursue his interests.  I think one <br/>\nkey is to really watch them and find out what they are interested in and then <br/>\nuse these interests to build on things.  Sometimes my kids under 6 are all <br/>\ntogether-but all doing different things.  For instance, my 6 yo loves to play <br/>\nimaginary games outside.  My 4 yo loves more work-oriented things.  So, I <br/>\nmight let the 6 yo play, get the 4yo started raking leaves, put the 2 yo in <br/>\nthe sand box and then carry the baby around in the sling while I hang wash on <br/>\nthe line. <br/>\n <br/>\nYou also wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I get somewhat <br/>\n concerned that my oldest gets slighted because I  get so distracted by <br/>\nhaving <br/>\n to keep up with the other two, as well; and my 3 yo &#39;s skill level is not up <br/>\n to that of his bro&#39;s, so they cannot do the same things very often.  As it <br/>\n is, the baby does not take long naps, which would otherwise open up more <br/>\ntime <br/>\n for the boys.  In fact, neither of the older kids nap, either.  I guess I am <br/>\n finding it hard to balance things out. &gt;&gt; <br/>\nOne bit of advice I took away from a h/sing conference I attended once was <br/>\nthis:  Take a look at how much time you think you have each week or each day <br/>\nto spend one on one with each child and then cut that in half and then set up <br/>\na time with that child and honor it.  They get to do anything they want (you <br/>\ncan set limits like monetary ones, of course!) with you and they have you <br/>\nentirely to themselves.  You can do a separate time with Dad too.<br/>\nWe have done this in my home for about a year.  Each child gets 15 minutes a <br/>\nday to spend with Mom and 15 minutes a week with Dad.  This sounds like <br/>\nlittle time, I know, but remember something is better than nothing.  And this <br/>\nis their EXCLUSIVE time.  This has helped a lot for me with the younger ones <br/>\nespecially.  They have learned to save what they think is important for those <br/>\ntimes.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you can see the positive, too, because this time when they are <br/>\nlittle really does fly!
