I could record it for you but it would just be vhs, not<br/>\nnearly as nice as a DVD. <br/>\n<br/>\nI liked hearing about your sons interest in birds. (Happy Birthday Jake!)<br/>\n Dylan is very interested too and saved his money for nice binoculars.  <br/>\nThere is a WMA about thirty miles from us and we go there often.  There<br/>\nwas a colony of American White Pelicans there for the first time this<br/>\nsummer. There were reports of several new colonies in western Montana<br/>\nthis year.   I&#39;m glad we were so close to one. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis valley we live in was contaminated by heavy metals from mine<br/>\ntailings and fallout from copper smelting.   It&#39;s only been in the last<br/>\nten years or so, wildlife is returning here after extensive (and ongoing)<br/>\nSuperfund reclamation.   We can hike to the rookery and see fifteen Great<br/>\nBlue Herons on the roost and Bald Eagles, Osprey and assorted shorebirds,<br/>\nducks and geese.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan is a Magpie fan too.  We&#39;ve had a lot this year and their getting<br/>\nbolder about being in town.  We watched one trying to break open some<br/>\nwalnuts we set out one day.  He picked one up and hopped along the tops<br/>\nof the picket fence to the gate with a stone path beneath it.  He aimed<br/>\nand dropped it, then flumped down to see if it had cracked open.  He did<br/>\nthat several times and when he couldn&#39;t get it open he took it to the<br/>\neave of the house and dropped it from there.  After awhile he&#39;d banged it<br/>\naround enough to get it open.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was great to see your post Anne, I loved reading your birding<br/>\nadventures. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4261131,"authorName":"Anne Ohman","from":"&quot;Anne Ohman&quot; &lt;ohman@...&gt;","profile":"anneounschooler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Any birdwatchers among you?","postDate":"1064659572","msgId":81641,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTMwMWMzODRlNCQ5MjFhMWE2MCRjNWQ2ZDdhYUA1MTFpZj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTI2LjA4MDYzNi4xMTkyLjYuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":81643,"prevInTime":81640,"nextInTime":81642,"topicId":81641,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***It s on satellite pay per view too!
