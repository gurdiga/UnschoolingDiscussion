The kids <br/>\n&gt;love<br/>\n&gt;finding the treasure and they actually want to go for hikes now!  We also<br/>\n&gt;just got some travel bugs and will be releasing them sometime soon.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;really fun to look for geocaches while traveling because it gets you out to<br/>\n&gt;places you might not have seen otherwise (even works in your own home<br/>\n&gt;town!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Happy geocaching!<br/>\n&gt;Kristin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;From: bunsofaluminum [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt;I got my hubby a GPS unit for his b-day, and we&#39;re going to<br/>\n&gt;start Geo-cacheing.
