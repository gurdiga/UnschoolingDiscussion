Neill, who founded a famous school called \n<i>Summerhill</i> in England in the 1920s. (It is still going today.) When I was \nfourteen years old, I was lucky enough to go to Barker Free School, a boarding \nschool in Canada, which was run just like Summerhill.</p>\n<p>&quot;Neill was adamant that you must never force a child to learn. \nWhich meant I didn&#8217;t have to attend any classes if I didn&#8217;t want to. So I \ndidn&#8217;t. Occasionally I would rouse myself to play soccer if I felt like it. And \nwhen the school bought an old Plymouth and stuck it in a field where we couldn&#8217;t \ndo too much harm with it, every once in a while I&#8217;d have a bash at learning how \nto drive. But most of the time all I did was lie around.</p>\n<p>&quot;In the first six months I never even opened a textbook, but I \ndid get through more than two hundred Marvel comics. <i>&#8216;The Mighty Thor&#8217;</i> \nwas my favourite. I tell you, for a 14-year-old boy that place was paradise.</p>\n<p>&quot;It sounds like not much was happening, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, in \nfact, a great deal of untangling was going on in my head, out of sight to \neveryone including myself. My natural ability and desire to learn had been so \nbruised and battered from ten years of force-fed schooling, that it was taking \nit a while to wake up to the fact that it could do whatever it wanted to \nnow.</p>\n<p>&quot;After two years of &quot;free schooling&quot;, I went back into the \nnormal school system. I passed exams for all of Year 10 and half of Year 11. In \nother words, I was about four months behind where I would have been if I had \nstayed in high school. But I knew catching up would be no problem, because I \nhardly touched a textbook before sitting those exams. In fact<i>, only on five \nseparate days had I done any formal textbook study in the whole two years.</i> \nSo my <i>knowledge</i> hadn&#8217;t really changed at all.</p>\n<p>&quot;What <i>had</i> changed is that my natural ability to learn \nhad been wonderfully rehabilitated, just by everybody leaving it alone. So it \nwas much easier for me to <i>use</i> the knowledge I had already learned, and to \ngain more whenever I felt like it. Which has helped me enormously throughout the \nrest of my life.</p>\n<p>&quot;This experience also gave me a special awareness of this instinctive \nlearning faculty we all possess, which I&#8217;ve been fascinated with, and tinkering \nwith, for over thirty years now. Thanks to A.S. Neill, and the wise teachers who \napplied his principles to that &quot;lazy&quot; 14-year-old . . . &quot;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">This is a wonderful site, by the way!</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Gus Griffin</font></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"B & T Simpson","from":"&quot;B & T Simpson&quot; &lt;michigan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"PBZLk7J-JSdMt-T7N1DiqqkAu3dLvuWLjIsr-_9L6xGOFp5y2wVvjJwquu7mClNgtBZtObMJ3OpKV0Rjs2XLwgxtMZ14yaCjc2VBUw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] How Long?","postDate":"957372618","msgId":8398,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWJmYjUxZiRhYTVkMDYyMCQ0ZDEwOGMxOEBjb21wYXEuc3NzbmV0LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8399,"prevInTime":8397,"nextInTime":8399,"topicId":8398,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Tamie, we have been unschooling since last Feb and we love it, there are some days I wonder mostly because my children  like to take 4 hours or more to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1002244350\">Hi Tamie,<br/>\nwe have been unschooling since last Feb and we love it, there are some days<br/>\nI wonder mostly because my children  like to take 4 hours or more to<br/>\ncomplete simple chores they have for the day thus wasting the entire day!!!<br/>\nthis gets on my nerves allot!

Things are just soooo busy. Anyhow,<br/>\n&gt;I have been homeschooling since Dec. and only unschooling since Feb.<br/>\n&gt;I was just wondering how long do I just sit back and let her<br/>\n&gt;(Kearstin-81/2Yog) &quot;Deschool&quot;? She just wants to watch T.V., shes up<br/>\n&gt;till all hours of the night. And I noticed a great increase in<br/>\n&gt;appetite and gaining weight!! (getting nervous) We go to the library<br/>\n&gt;once a week and she gets alot of videos on animals and stuff like that<br/>\n&gt;mostly national geographic. And I thought she wasnt learning anything<br/>\n&gt;but Im getting nervous about all the hanging around so I started a<br/>\n&gt;game of 20 questions in the car and she picked animals as her cat.<br/>\n&gt;she did really good on exotic animals but couldnt figure out what cat<br/>\n&gt;was? (maybe too obvious?) We have not covered any other subjects and<br/>\n&gt;when I bring anything up she gets aggravated with me. We havent even<br/>\n&gt;thought about testing yet, and even though my state (NH) is pretty<br/>\n&gt;easy to please, it is getting late in the season and now Im afraid to<br/>\n&gt;test her. Has anyone heard of the PASS Test and do you know anything<br/>\n&gt;about it? I have noticed a big difference in her attitude which to me<br/>\n&gt;aught to be good enough I thought that was a great feat. She lapses<br/>\n&gt;into that &quot;Cocky&quot; attitude every once in a while but just a look gets<br/>\n&gt;rid of it. and we are a little more like partners now , I think we<br/>\n&gt;need a little more practice but were getting there. Well Id like to<br/>\n&gt;hear from anyone one who has a hard time to be patient.
