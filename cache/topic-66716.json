Today, this woman called in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very upset because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she caught her little daughter eating ants. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly reassured her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the ants are not harmful and there would be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no need to bring her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daughter into the hospital. She calmed down and at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the end of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conversation happened to mention that she gave her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daughter some ant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poison to eat in order to kill the ants. I told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her that she better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring her daughter into the emergency room right<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s your sign, lady. Wear it with pride.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **********************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Early this year, some Boeing employees on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airfield decided to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steal a life raft from one of the 747s. They were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successful in getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it out of the plane and home. Shortly after they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; took it for a float on the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; river, they noticed a Coast Guard helicopter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coming towards them. It turned<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chopper was homing in on the emergency locator<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beacon that activated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when the raft was inflated. They are no longer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; employed at Boeing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s your sign, guys. Don&#39;t get it wet; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paint might run.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A true story out of San Francisco:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walked into the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; branch and wrote &quot;this iz a stikkup. Put all your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; muny in this bag.&quot; While<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standing in line, waiting to give his note to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; teller, he began to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worry that someone had seen him write the note and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might call the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; police before he reached the teller&#39;s window. So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he left the Bank of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; America<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. After<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waiting a few minutes in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; teller. She read it and,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the brightest light<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the harbor, told him that she could not accept<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his stickup note<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it was written on a Bank of America<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deposit slip and that he would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or go back to Bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of America. Looking somewhat defeated, the man<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;OK&quot; and left. He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was arrested a few minutes later, as he was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waiting in line back at Bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of America.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t bother with this guy&#39;s sign. He probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t read it anyway.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A guy walked into a little corner store with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shotgun and demanded all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the cash from the cash drawer. After the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cashier put the cash in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bag, the robber saw a bottle of Scotch that he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted behind the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counter on the shelf. He told the cashier to put<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it in the bag as well, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cashier refused and said, &quot;Because I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe you are over 21.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The robber said he was, but the clerk still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; refused to give it to him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he didn&#39;t believe him. At this point, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; robber took his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; driver&#39;s license out of his wallet and gave it to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the clerk. The clerk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked it over and agreed that the man was in fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over 21 and he put<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Scotch in the bag. The robber then ran from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the store with his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loot. The cashier promptly called the police and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gave the name and address<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the robber that he got off the license. They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arrested the robber two<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hours later.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This guy definitely needs a sign.!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A pair of Michigan robbers entered a record shop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nervously waving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revolvers. The first one shouted, &quot;Nobody move!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When his partner<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moved, the startled first bandit shot him.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This guy doesn&#39;t need a sign, he probably figured<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it out himself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ****************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arkansas: Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; badly. He decided<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he&#39;d just throw a cinder block through a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liquor store window, grab<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some booze, and run. So he lifted the cinder block<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and heaved it over his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head at the window. The cinder block bounced back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and hit the would-be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thief on the head, knocking him unconscious. It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems the liquor store<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; window was made of Plexiglas. The whole event was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caught on videotape.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, that smarts.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Give him his sign.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ******************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ann Arbor: The Ann Arbor News crime column<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reported that a man walked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 12:50<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A. M.., flashed a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gun and demanded cash. The clerk turned him down<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he said he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t open the cash register without a food<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; order. When the man ordered<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; onion rings, the clerk said they weren&#39;t available<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for breakfast. The man,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frustrated, walked away.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sign please.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *****************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that all of the above people are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allowed to vote.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;__________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The New Yahoo!
