I have met people who think nothing of having sex in their<br/>\nliving room in front of their children,,,guess that would not be a whole lot<br/>\ndifferent than watching on t.v. but my personal opinion is these people have<br/>\nno idea the kind of harm they are creating in their chil;dren&#39;s lives.  By<br/>\nthe time there children are grown and they see the damage it will be set.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I realize I have seen far more of life than most people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are not the least bit uncomfortable with violence either, I know<br/>\nbecause I have been a victim of kidnap, rape, being held hostage and being<br/>\nshot at (more than once). I have lived long enough to see the result of<br/>\nseveral generations grow up and live according to what they were subjected<br/>\nto.  The more you observe something, the more acceptable it becomes in your<br/>\nmind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not believe in letting them do whatever they want.  I don&#39;t think a<br/>\nchild should raise themself .  I believe they need some guidance and<br/>\nassistance in this cruel world.  Certain things can not be properly<br/>\ncomprehended or understood by a child and until they can understand it they<br/>\nshould not be subjected to it.  There are a lot of sickos in this world and<br/>\nsome of them write the scripts we watch.  I am just narrow minded enough not<br/>\nto want these children subjected to the things in life that nearly destroyed<br/>\nmy life as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can not make others care about these things or understand them possibly,<br/>\nbut I can still have my feelings and opinions on the matter and I will still<br/>\ntry to raise well balanced children, with morals and compassion and<br/>\nconsideration for their fellow man ( or woman)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not talking about every little thing.  I am talking about violence and<br/>\nthe physical act of sex.  I do not and will not allow x -rated shows in my<br/>\nhouse.   I believe rated R shows should not be seen by small  children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not expect everyone to agree with me.

Period.  No <br/>\nexceptions.  Want exceptions...grow up, provide for yourself and move into <br/>\nyour own place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children are free to choose any reading materials we own or borrow.  If <br/>\nit is here, they are welcome to read it.  In fact, we often take turns <br/>\nreading the same book.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for TV, movies or music, I have veto power.  I am offended by many things <br/>\nthat are presented in the media and I pay the rent, cable and power bills, so <br/>\nI get to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that whatever is happening here sets the tone and we all react to <br/>\nit so I&#39;m arbitrary about it, too; especially if I don&#39;t like it at a gut <br/>\nlevel, it goes off.  I will make an attempt to explain my position if there <br/>\nis genuine interest in knowing why.  If &#39;why&#39; is simply an attempt to argue, <br/>\nI&#39;m not interested.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the AMOUNT of TV, videos, music, etc., I&#39;m pretty flexible.  Generally <br/>\nspeaking all are free to watch how much they would like.  However, we are <br/>\nexpected to share; we are not a household that has a TV per person.  <br/>\nSometimes that means parents watch kids&#39; shows, other times kids watch <br/>\nparents&#39; shows.  It is very rare that I would have something on that I would <br/>\nnot feel comfortable having my children watch with me.  The most glaring <br/>\nexception I can think of is a show that might be personally disturbing, say <br/>\nabout child abuse or kidnapping.  This could happen with a documentary or <br/>\nsomething where I really feel the information is useful, but don&#39;t want to <br/>\ntraumatize a child, for instance.  In that case, if I think it may be too <br/>\ngraphic or disturbing to the child(ren), they don&#39;t get to watch.  (I am <br/>\nwilling to tape and watch it later, rather than have anyone feel neglected)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother exception is the sound level.  I hate fight scenes, clattery sounds <br/>\nand other noisy show sounds.  It literally gives me jitters.  In that case, <br/>\nif we can&#39;t find an acceptable sound level, the show can&#39;t be watched.  <br/>\n(you&#39;d be amazed at what great hearing my kids suddenly develop when it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething they really want to watch!  LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, nobody better even attempt to come over and tell me what we should or <br/>\nshould not be watching.  Nor would I ever feel it appropriate to control what <br/>\nanother family watches on the TV in their living room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cents worth,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"aworthen","from":"&quot;aworthen&quot; &lt;aworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0KOhPWtbXX_4kEkj-hfkulUxLeKWNnZRw6cV-_fUTsJTJNfE7jdiVeEZwQQiX86IfJaTZDyhG2EIvWVHVpJxQgvZ4o_Xx83xGg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] censorship","postDate":"967857625","msgId":12390,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDkwMWMwMTQ3YiRmOTcwNjcwMCRkM2E0ODAxOEBuZS5tZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PEYzNnFPc1ZWMGRNeXBPVVI3WnQwMDAwMjhkZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12382,"nextInTopic":12396,"prevInTime":12389,"nextInTime":12391,"topicId":12376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It might be worth looking into.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\nMom to Samantha, Dana, and Casey </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ecsamhill@aol.com","from":"ecsamhill@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9cpjeqOLdjA31lQ1l2S1y9Fuvk7LCt_XKr75t042DiKYuHUjY1DQCbqR3jeGHcHzSkx_z7R4vYg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] censorship","postDate":"967842769","msgId":12382,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUyLjk1Zjg2ZDMuMjZlMTc1ZDFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12378,"nextInTopic":12390,"prevInTime":12381,"nextInTime":12383,"topicId":12376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/1/2000 8:03:32 PM, samiot@cfl.rr.com writes:  My husband is the same.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-984245905\">In a message dated 9/1/2000 8:03:32 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:samiot@...\">samiot@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;DH uses it to unwind even if &quot;there&#39;s nothing worth watching&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is the same.

What about censorship in reading and TV <br/>\nwatching? I remember reading in books by the guy who started Sudbury Valley <br/>\nschool (based on unschooling) that he believes there should be NO censorship <br/>\nof reading materials, that kids of any age should be free to read whatever <br/>\nthey want. And that if kids wanted to watch TV all day for how ever long, <br/>\nthey should be allowed to...<br/>\n<br/>\nSounded okay to me...We live in the country and have terrible TV reception <br/>\nand rarely turn on the TV and up until now, my ds have been happily reading <br/>\nthe classics and other books on the Oak Meadow reading list.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that my one d is 13 and the other is almost 11, things are suddenly <br/>\nchanging. They have both discovered the condensed version of the Reader&#39;s <br/>\nDigest and have been reading them avidly for some time. This has led to an <br/>\ninterest in adult mysteries for my 10 yo. Also, we just got a satelite dish <br/>\nand suddenly we are receiving 45 channels with all kinds of stuff that I <br/>\ncan&#39;t even believe is on there. I want them to be free and I know they are <br/>\nvery curious about the world (especially the almost 11 yo)...but this <br/>\nwalking around the shadow is very uncomfortable for me and part of me just <br/>\nwants to say NO to Tv altogether!!! At this point, we are only watching <br/>\nshows that are rated for children and only about an hour or 2 in the evening <br/>\nat most...But I am concerned about when the girls are left alone...I think <br/>\nif I had no restrictions, my younger daughter might be glued to all kinds of <br/>\nstuff all day long.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease respond!!! Mixed up between freedom and censorship!!!<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34838,"nextTopicId":34706}}
