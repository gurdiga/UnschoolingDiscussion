However, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure quietness and peace are always the inner signs that learning is <br/>\ngoing on. At least not for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, usually you think you suck, and are playing horribly, and it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t cross your mind that you are learning. Instead you think you gotta <br/>\ngo home and practice -- the assumption being that we learn during practice <br/>\n(study). Other times you&#39;re bored stiff, but still taking things seriously <br/>\nand doing your best not to simply go through the motions; you try to make the <br/>\ncommon, uncommon. Other times -- very rare times -- everything comes together <br/>\nand you&#39;re in the zone and playing wonderfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid to say that those latter moments are to be indulged in prudently. <br/>\nFor when you think you&#39;re doin&#39; it, chances are you aren&#39;t! And this is the <br/>\nzen. Bummer. And when you&#39;re struggling, and reaching, and ... failing! ... <br/>\nthat is when the learning is going on and you&#39;re actually making great <br/>\nprogress. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, we should indeed glory in glorious moments, but then we <br/>\nshould thank God for them and move on, else we might make glorious moments <br/>\nour goal rather than improving. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning also means forgetting, but having been transformed in the process. <br/>\nImagine what we&#39;d be like if we remembered and had at hand everything we&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned. What bores. We&#39;d never be invited to dinner parties!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of learning and progress being a struggle gives America&#39;s political <br/>\nand cultural issues (among other things) a new light, for while we obsess <br/>\nover whatever it is making the news (kidnappings, corporate scandals, <br/>\nPOLITICS IN EDUCATION), and we think we&#39;re headed for Hell in a hand basket, <br/>\nit&#39;s quite possible that we&#39;re making great strides toward humane <br/>\ncivilization instead. But don&#39;t quote me on that, I&#39;m no guru or philosopher.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nBob <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40321,"nextTopicId":40324}}
