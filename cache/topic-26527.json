We auditioned kids 12 (I said 13, meant 12) and older.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there are some situations in this play that are somewhat adult in scope and we felt more comfortable dealing with older kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons we picked Pollyanna for the spring is because we&#39;ll be writing our own script and can add lots of parts for all ages. It makes me both tremendously excited and completely exhausted to think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26584,"nextTopicId":26589}}
