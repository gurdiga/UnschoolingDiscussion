Organics must be certified as organic meaning the land has to be chemical free for at least six years and there is a lot of paperwork.  It costs much more $2.00 for regular eggs compared to $4.00 organic unless you know the farmer. <br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Alberta and the laws and regulations change from Province to Province so you would have to look at each province separately.  I know some of the smaller Eastern Provinces have different laws regarding home Ed and Birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\nTeresa in Canada <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Heather Hall <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, July 31, 2003 10:06 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Digest Number 3876<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  What kind of choices do you have for vax, home birth,  and organic food <br/>\n  regulation etc?<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Thursday, July 31, 2003, at 02:34 AM, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Me too.
