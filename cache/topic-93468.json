I think part of the problem is that we might be misunderstanding each other (me and the coordinator).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, she is the same coordinator who has been there since I first tried to get involved.  I can&#39;t imagine why she can&#39;t explain 4H well enough for me to understand.  I don&#39;t have this much trouble understanding anything else LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that she is running things differently than other areas.  For example, she allows the leaders to set space limits on project groups.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first asked about 4H, nobody ever mentioned to me that there was a difference between community clubs and project clubs, something I consider rather important (duh).  They just asked me if I wanted a community club.  I had no idea there were different kinds or what the differences were.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe made it sound like a family can&#39;t just do their own project, then made it sound like I was talking about doing something outside of 4H, and she never even mentioned what our options were once we were part of a club.  This leads me to believe that they don&#39;t encourage that option because she would have mentioned it since I specifically asked about doing our own project.  (She wouldn&#39;t have assumed that I meant &quot;outside of 4H&quot;.)<br/>\n <br/>\nThe only options she gave me were to join the existing projects within the club, or start my own *club*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI specifically pointed out to her that the National website says you can enroll any time of year.  But she apparently decided that they would do a limited enrollment, and then only once a year!  There is time from the March meeting until May 1st to enroll, but like I said, many of the projects have limited space, so if you don&#39;t get what you want at the meeting, your poop out of luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really irked me that when I called I asked if we could still enroll and she said &quot;no, enrollment was closed May 1st&quot; and told me we would have to wait until NEXT MARCH! (Especially because its only May 5!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state office wasn&#39;t much help either, but I think I am going to contact them again.

She is sending me written info though.  We&#39;ll see what that says.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say I&#39;m rather disgusted, and I&#39;m REALLY glad I asked about it here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I&#39;m rambling.  I just can&#39;t get over how ridiculous it all seems!  But I&#39;ll grant, I could be missing something here.

I was in tears.  He made all kinds of nasty remarks about how it wasn&#39;t a &quot;real&quot; model, and it wasn&#39;t even well painted, etc.  I think he even refused to give it a participating ribbon.  His remarks were FULL of contempt and disgust.<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t believe anyone could be such an asshole.  I contacted the office and let them have it.
