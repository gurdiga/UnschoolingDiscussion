I still nurse the youngest to sleep, then I go <br/>\nand lay with my son. Often he falls asleep on his own first. They <br/>\nnever had a crib and never slept in their own bed until they <br/>\nrequested it, so they never really knew any different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was just wondering if this was coming from originally the child <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parent.

But he&#39;s capable of going to <br/>\nsleep on his own, without me. He often does while I&#39;m still getting <br/>\nhis little sister to sleep, and both of them go to sleep fine with DH <br/>\non nights that I&#39;m out late. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a lot of fear in our culture that kids won&#39;t outgrow <br/>\nthings (nursing, the family bed, etc.). Like if you lay down with <br/>\nthem to get them to sleep, or nurse them to sleep, they&#39;ll never be <br/>\nable to go to sleep on their own. I&#39;ve never worried that my kids <br/>\nwould require me to come to their college dorm room to lay down with <br/>\nthem so they can get to sleep :-). It&#39;s a fleeting time in their life <br/>\nwhen they want or need a parent so intensely. For some kids, they <br/>\ngrow into independence much sooner (my daughter, for instance, can <br/>\neasily go to sleep without me at 3, my son never could do that until <br/>\nalmost 6) But all kids will grow into independence when they&#39;re ready <br/>\nfor it. They grew out of the family bed when they were ready, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, for the record, I also sat in the back with my son in the car, <br/>\nand I don&#39;t have to do that anymore either :-). He&#39;d rather sit with <br/>\nhis friends than with mom these days. We went to Harry Potter a <br/>\ncouple of weeks ago, and he didn&#39;t even sit in the same row as me. <br/>\nSheesh, such independence.

Easier for nursing, etc. My son is 2.5 (2.75 really :) and every single day of his life I have laid with him until he fell asleep, at night and for naps. This includes the night that I was in labor with dd, during my homebirth. He woke up several times that night, and each time I went to him and laid with him during my contractions... :)  The one time he called for me and I didn&#39;t respond was when I was pushing dd&#39;s head out and couldn&#39;t exactly go to him...LOL, but then he came out to witness the birth and all was fine....but i stray from the topic now...I will lay/sleep with my children until they tell me I am no longer needed. The reasoning behind attachment parenting is not that the children will be insecure if you&#39;re not around as they get older, as it might seem...it actually leads to more secure children, because they know you will always be there, so they are comfortable later on in being independent. <br/>\nKeara<br/>\n <br/>\n Mary Bianco &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a>&gt; wrote:Sorry about that last one, not sure what happened.
