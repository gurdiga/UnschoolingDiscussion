We used<br/>\nto control television and last Spring, I decided to give control to the<br/>\nkiddies.  Adriane&#39;s behind stayed glued to the chair watching rerun after<br/>\nrerun.  I am not a big TV person and it drove me nuts.  She was grouchy,<br/>\ngrumpy, complained of being tired all the time.  After about 4 months, she<br/>\nannounced &quot;I get real tired if I just sit and watch TV all the time.&quot;   She<br/>\nnow watches maybe an hour or 2 throughout the day but is also riding her<br/>\nbike, spending time outside, playing on the computer, writing stories,<br/>\ndrawing, etc..  She was able to balance it herself, but it took a lot longer<br/>\nfor her to reach that conclusion for herself than it took me to want to<br/>\nimpose my conclusions on her.  Could the same apply to your son?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, why do you want him to tire of the games?  Because he gets tired and<br/>\ngrumpy or because you think the games aren&#39;t &quot;educational&quot;?  I think it<br/>\nmakes a huge difference and can pinpoint a roadblock in unschooling success.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27549,"nextTopicId":27550}}
