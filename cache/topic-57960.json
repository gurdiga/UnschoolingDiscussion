Same with madrigals singers.  They <br/>\npractice together a lot, and in a performance they are, to some extent, <br/>\n&quot;singing along&quot; with the lead singer.  You usually can&#39;t tell from looking <br/>\nunless just as they start three are looking at one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with an orchestra they&#39;re not working  from memory and they&#39;re not <br/>\nlooking around much.   Also with small-group music, each person can see the <br/>\nother people&#39;s parts.  They&#39;re singing or playing one of three or four or <br/>\nfive parts, but they can see what the other people are doing.  So if they <br/>\ncome in right after a certain run or section, they see on the paper that the <br/>\nother people have finished; they hear it while they see it, and they come in.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an orchestra, only the conductor has the music that shows all the parts  <br/>\n(the score).  The others have individual sheets with JUST their own parts on. <br/>\n If they&#39;re resting for a long time (others are playing and they&#39;re not) <br/>\ntheir music probably just shows a black square with a number on the top.  And <br/>\nsometimes that&#39;s a big number.  If your music says you don&#39;t do anything for <br/>\nanother 124 measures, it&#39;s good to have someone to &#39;cue you&#39; when it&#39;s nearly <br/>\nyour turn to come in and to point at you just as you&#39;re in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more than that, that conductors do, but in simplest practical terms, <br/>\nthat&#39;s part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] conductors","postDate":"1044468958","msgId":57960,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNjcxMzBELjFEOEUlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDQ0NjM4NTMuMjAwNC4xNDAyMy5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57990,"prevInTime":57959,"nextInTime":57961,"topicId":57960,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
