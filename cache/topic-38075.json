I&#39;ve said to<br/>\nboth of them, together and alone, that any time they want my attention<br/>\nand don&#39;t have it they just need to ask me.  I also *offer* my full<br/>\nattention quite often- as in &quot;I&#39;ll be done with this in a minute...would<br/>\nyou like to read a book/play a game with me?&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m about to bake<br/>\ncookies would you like to help?&quot; etc etc.  The answer is &quot;no thanks&quot; as<br/>\noften as it is &quot;yes,&quot; so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my plain old attention that<br/>\nthey&#39;re craving so much - they seem to be more interested in  the type<br/>\nof attention where I&#39;m &quot;on their side&quot; at the expense of their sibling.<br/>\nNot that I take sides- I try very hard to see both sides, but they each<br/>\ntry just as hard to get me to take theirs.<br/>\nI&#39;m also afraid there might be a little bit of an adrenaline addiction<br/>\ngoing on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, I think the fighting around here was particularly bad today<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; both boys were very tired.

Our worst days are when the factors all combine... sleep<br/>\ndeprivation (I dread those days following unusually late nights), too<br/>\nmuch crappy food, especially with food dye, and the worst of all-<br/>\nisolation.

I do feel like I know exactly what <br/>\nyou&#39;re going through. Today I had to take my two boys, 5 and 9, home from <br/>\nthe pool early because they wouldn&#39;t stop fighting, chasing and teasing each <br/>\nother. It was that same kind of thing: &quot;He LOOKED at me!&quot; &quot;He TOUCHED me!&quot; <br/>\nfollowed by glass-splintering screams from the younger guy. The other <br/>\nparents at the pool were politely ignoring them, or being sympathetic, but <br/>\nthe other kids were starting to shoot us some annoyed looks. I was feeling <br/>\nlike a bad mom and a bad pool member!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, though I don&#39;t have any answers to this situation, I&#39;ll be looking <br/>\nat the discussion with great interest to see if anyone else does.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have heard is that sibling rivalry is really a way that kids <br/>\ncompete for our attention. So therefore time alone with each child on a <br/>\nregular basis should help. I try to do that. I don&#39;t know how much good it <br/>\ndoes, other than it&#39;s good to get them apart for a while, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think the fighting around here was particularly bad today because <br/>\nboth boys were very tired. They&#39;d both had sleepovers last night and stayed <br/>\nup very late. I find that when they&#39;re tired or hungry, the fighting is a <br/>\nlot worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents. Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38057,"nextTopicId":2147}}
