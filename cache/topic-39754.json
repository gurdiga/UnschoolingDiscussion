(We&#39;re trying to solve problems<br/>\nhere, right?) <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fairness to all, I think that because of usage (or evolution, if you<br/>\nwill), dove has come to be an acceptable (or accepted) form for the past<br/>\ntense of dive. However, the discussion was about trying to make English<br/>\neasier to learn. So in working with the list of sentences that included<br/>\nwords with two pronunciations for the same spelling, my purpose was to try<br/>\nto make changes that would avoid confusions. Hey, if the language evolved,<br/>\nand is still evolving, then we might as well participate...sure, this egroup<br/>\ncould go a long way to simplifying the language.
