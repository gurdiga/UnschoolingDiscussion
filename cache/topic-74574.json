My sister said she was worried about if daughter&#39;s teeth would be affected by the thumb sucking.  They came up with the plan that daughter would stop sucking her thumb when her first front tooth fell out.  I think my niece was 7 (I know some are younger and your son might already have lost his, I don&#39;t know) when that happened and she did stop.  She had many years of knowing that was the goal and had no problem with it.

I could never do that to my daughter.  Geez!  Quick story....  We were living in Helena, had just gotten our home, but were still sleeping nights at the hotel.  The one night, Margaux forgot her Perri and Huggy (big pink bunny and blanket).  Shahram was exhausted and I was exhausted.  I didn&#39;t want to drive across town and get them.  She said she couldn&#39;t sleep without them, so I told her that she didn&#39;t have to sleep, if she didn&#39;t want to.  We told her that Perri and Huggy were keeping our cat company and they would surely not want to make her cry.  So I held her and she eventually got uncomfortable and wanted to lie down.  We both got into bed together, and 2 minutes later she was softly snoring.  When she got up in the morning, she thanked me for staying with her and said she still missed Perri and Huggy.  So, we left right away and went to the apartment to see Perri and Huggy.  If Perri and Huggy were ever actually lost, the whole family would be devastated.  They are such a part of her and who she is.  I crocheted Huggy for her when she was still inside my belly.  Perriwinkle, the bunny, was given to her one Easter when I had no money to spend and we were living solo.  That bunny would not let me leave the store without her.  So, I felt that Perri and Margaux were meant to be together.  I could never intentionally lose Perri.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think I could cause my daughter that kind of pain intentionally.  I still have my Chewbacca doll from my childhood.  I&#39;m glad my mom didn&#39;t lose him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichole<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] thumb sucking?","postDate":"1055871373","msgId":74613,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzOS4yMTRkNjU5YS4yYzIwYWI4ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74611,"nextInTopic":74615,"prevInTime":74612,"nextInTime":74614,"topicId":74574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/17/03 10:10:57 AM, mummy124@bellsouth.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-852308533\">In a message dated 6/17/03 10:10:57 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve found that *losing* them really works.

She&#39;s done <br/>\nit all her life in her teen years (and I knew her then) some thought it was a <br/>\nproblem.  When she gave birth the first time I remember a nurse having a <br/>\nproblem with finding a MOTHER sleeping with her thumb in her mouth.  Her front <br/>\nteeth, despite wearing braces in her teens are still protruding.  She doesn&#39;t find <br/>\nit a problem, no one else seems to care anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son was a thumbsucker, since birth.  At seven the dentist put an <br/>\nappliance in his mouth to prevent him from sucking his thumb at night.  Matthew <br/>\ntried every nasty tasting substance to avoid the thumbsucking.  He REALLY <br/>\nwanted to stop.  He had a cabbage patch doll, he cut his thumb off, it worried me, <br/>\nthe appliance might have helped him NOT to suck the thumb but it helped him <br/>\nemotionally to THINK it was over.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one in our home cared if he sucked his thumb, SIL was still doing it, <br/>\nMatthew didn&#39;t want to do it and eventually he did stop.  I&#39;m really not 100% sure <br/>\nbecause he hasn&#39;t lived at home for a few years.  When he does sleep over he <br/>\nhas his SO with him so I don&#39;t go in his room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest girl has a &quot;binky&quot; which is her blanket.  She&#39;s 15, she still <br/>\npacks it for overnight trips.  Will she sleep with it when she&#39;s married?  <br/>\nDoesn&#39;t bother me but I have heard relatives comment on it, her friends accept it as <br/>\npart of her.

I never thought it was any big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph had a pacifier. He loved his pasher. Had a ton of them. He used them<br/>\nuntil he was a little over 4.

She only uses it<br/>\nduring the day and only when she remembers. It was her idea. She was getting<br/>\nsick a lot. It was always only her and I talked to her that it was because<br/>\nof her thumb always in her mouth. So we talked about germs and washing her<br/>\nhands and using the anitbacterial stuff. She decided on the thumb stuff<br/>\ninstead. It works for her and she hasn&#39;t said she doesn&#39;t want to do it.<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed when she doesn&#39;t use the stuff, she doesn&#39;t suck like she use<br/>\nto. She also always takes it off at night so she can still use her thumb.<br/>\nI&#39;m still not worried. If she reaches 16 and still does it, I&#39;ll let you<br/>\nknow how I feel about it then. I&#39;m really not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlyssa loves her pashers. We&#39;ve gone through hundreds. She loses them<br/>\nregularly. She goes through periods when she never has them during the day<br/>\nand then days when it&#39;s always in her mouth. Being that I nursed on demand,<br/>\nI was sure, as I was told that she wouldn&#39;t need a pacifier. Well she did<br/>\nanyway. She wanted to use me as a pacifier but didn&#39;t want the milk. So that<br/>\nwas her only choice as I saw it. When she talks I ask that she takes it out<br/>\nso I can understand her.

Is it really true that<br/>\nthumb-sucking can cause teeth to grow crooked? If it is, it is much easier<br/>\nto fix crooked teeth than a damaged spirit.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of my kids have been very attached to pacifiers.  Nicholette, in <br/>\nparticular.  She sucked on one until right around her 4th birthday.  The bad <br/>\nnews, in some cases, is yes, it does cause tooth misalignment.  The really <br/>\nbad news is that it also can cause the pallet to mishapen.  W have seen <br/>\nseveral dentists who have all told us that thumb sucking can be even more of <br/>\na problem.  (I tried to encourage thumb sucking over a pacifier for sanitary <br/>\nreasons.)  Her teeth grew in perfect, though after time, her pallet, and as <br/>\na result her teeth, grew in an arch.  One of her front teeth began to recess <br/>\nback into the gum.  Not disappear but the whole tooth was visible, looked <br/>\nlike it was on top of the gum on the outside and the bottom of her tooth was <br/>\nfluh with the bottom of her gumline, if that makes any sense.  It took a <br/>\nlong time to fall out and her permanant tooth grew in behind it.  Her <br/>\npermanant teeth look better but she still has a noticable arch to her teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe comments from others was very damaging to her.  People asked all the <br/>\ntime if she lost her first tooth.  This started very early, right about the <br/>\nage of 3.  She would tell them no and I would explain that the tooth was <br/>\nstill there.  She cried many times because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHannah also sucks a pacifier.  She will be 5 in September.  She doesn&#39;t do <br/>\nit very often now but she still does.  It&#39;s been hard to discourage with <br/>\nbabies in the house.  I&#39;ve found that *losing* them really works.  It <br/>\ngenerally takes a couple of days, during which I offer lots of extra <br/>\ncomfort, love and attention.  My boys and Hannah have almost completely <br/>\ngiven them up.  I notice that Chloe doesn&#39;t care for a pacifier and I wonder <br/>\nif this is a result of breastfeeding.  I was unable to nurse the other kids <br/>\nfor very long but Chloe is almost 9 months old and could care less about a <br/>\npacifier.  She&#39;s the first one!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been really torn about pacifiers.  On the one hand, they are <br/>\nvery comforting to children, on the other, I worried that they were just <br/>\nMommy substitutes.  In the end, it came down to paying attention to times of <br/>\nuse and reasons for use and I concluded it had nothing to do with the amount <br/>\nof attention or comfort I provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize you can&#39;t just *lose* a thumb! LOL  So, in that respect, I&#39;m sorry <br/>\nbut I can&#39;t offer any solutions for stopping.  I just wanted to add that it <br/>\n*can* in fact cause permanant damage.  I also agree though, that I&#39;d go for <br/>\nmy child&#39;s comfort and deal with the damage later.  Unless, like Nicholette, <br/>\nthe damge is causing the emotional pain, in which case, I would work on an <br/>\nagreeable alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] thumb sucking?","postDate":"1055861637","msgId":74594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjE3LjA4NTM1Ny4xNjcyLjEuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":74588,"nextInTopic":74598,"prevInTime":74593,"nextInTime":74595,"topicId":74574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I m looking for some opinions on thumb sucking.

Several months ago she stopped drinking her bottle out in the yard where people can see cuz she knows what people think and doesn&#39;t like their reaction I don&#39;t either, my hanai mom has finially learned to keep her mouth shut when she spends the night and dd asks for a bottle but I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, she can quit when she&#39;s ready and if she&#39;s still enjoying a bottle or two when she&#39;s 35 oh well. BTW I have asked her when she thinks she&#39;ll be ready to give her bottle and she says she&#39;s drinking bottle forever, so that&#39;s where it&#39;s at for now. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\np.s. I did make a one bottle a night rule becuz she sleeps w/me and I don&#39;t like being pee&#39;d on.
