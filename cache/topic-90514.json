We had the best night on Friday. A really great night of family bonding in front of the TV, watching a cartoon DVD. <br/>\n<br/>\nDh made pizza (long story, but an elimination diet turns this into a major treat), and everyone was so excited. My 5 yo had been perched atop the kitchen table (looking a lot like Gollum) working on legos for a couple of hours before dh got home. She&#39;d also worked a couple of puzzles, so the table was not looking promising for dinner. It had been a while since we&#39;d picnic-ed in our bedroom to watch a DVD, so I suggested that. Dh was all for it, and so were the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched Batman Beyond, which is *very* dark and really cool. Totally different than the Batman dh and I grew up with. Dh was really into it, and the kids were so incredibly happy. It was just one of those perfect moments. I couldn&#39;t help thinking about the conversations here recommending actually *watching* the shows your kids like. We&#39;ve been watching stuff together like this, playing computer games together a lot lately. It&#39;s been lots of fun, and I haven&#39;t seen it pulling us apart in any way.
