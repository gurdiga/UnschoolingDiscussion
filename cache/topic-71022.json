I think people <br/>\nwere probably older earlier, just from hard work, and maybe they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make 70, but I bet that folks made 60 (seventh decade). <br/>\nSaying &quot;we&quot; only lived to 35 back then...well, &quot;we&quot; did live longer <br/>\nthan 35. It gets mixed up statistically, averaging in infant and <br/>\nchildhood mortality.
