I like it, but it<br/>\nseems like a total waste of time.<br/>\nThis was killing me, and I almost said, &quot;ok, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours of<br/>\nPower Puffs is enough&quot;, but I bit my lip. Finally, after what seemed like an<br/>\neternity, she turned off the T.V. She them proceeded to sketch power puff<br/>\ngirls in various situations. Then, for a couple of weeks we researched<br/>\ncartoons, how they are made etc.-at her insistence.<br/>\nI realized that she was really studying the drawings, sound, voices, and who<br/>\nknows what else.<br/>\nEven if a child doesn&#39;t grab a sketch pad and ask questions about cartoons<br/>\nor offer &quot;proof&quot; of learning, I still think that they are learning<br/>\nsomething, who knows, they could be day dreaming about an entirely different<br/>\nsubject-that is what I am often doing while watching TV.<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27518,"nextTopicId":27511}}
