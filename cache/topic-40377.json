But we could talk about where the ideas about <br/>\nhell were borrowed (to go with that Mardi Gras history), and how many <br/>\ncultures believe that and have similar names for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you aware that the word Hell as translated is from the original word &quot;gehenna&quot; Here&#39;s the definition:<br/>\n<br/>\nGehenna <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n(originally Ge bene Hinnom; i.e., &quot;the valley of the sons of Hinnom&quot;), a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem, where the idolatrous Jews offered their children in sacrifice to Molech #2Ch 28:3 33:6 #Jer 7:31 19:2-6 This valley afterwards became the common receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hebrew word for hell actually means &quot;grave or pit&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else here see the connection with the Modern idea of hell - where you go and burn  after death - if you are bad... and Dante&#39;s Inferno??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:29 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Heaven, hell & Hitler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; have you ever wondered if hitler may have <br/>\n  asked for forgiveness,been forgiven and will be w/ all of you in heaven?i <br/>\n  have.by the way-hitler was austrian &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &#39;m&#39;kay<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not going to Heaven if you think there&#39;s any chance Hitler&#39;s there.<br/>\n  It&#39;s not his massive prejudices and the genocide that I see as his primary <br/>\n  sin.  It&#39;s the hypocrisy, if the biographers are telling the truth that his <br/>\n  own best buddies were all seriously &quot;flawed&quot; biologically.  And unless he <br/>\n  dyed his hair, he wouldn&#39;t be admitted into Aryan Nation or any of todays <br/>\n  &quot;ooh let&#39;s be like Hitler&quot; boys&#39; clubs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If Hitler can gain eternal paradise by saying &quot;oooh, sorry God&quot; at the last <br/>\n  minute, then my neighbor Helen Carter, the sweetest woman I have ever met, is <br/>\n  burning in hell for that same doctrine.  Because she was Catholic and thought <br/>\n  that all Protestants should just be Catholic too because it was the right way <br/>\n  to worship Jesus.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hell is a really stupid idea.  I wouldn&#39;t worship anyone who would come up <br/>\n  with an eternal fiery pit.  But we could talk about where the ideas about <br/>\n  hell were borrowed (to go with that Mardi Gras history), and how many <br/>\n  cultures believe that and have similar names for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wouldn&#39;t even wish an eternal fiery pit on Hitler.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
