So today he just up and said,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I need to get a new library card.&quot;  I said, &quot;Do you want to go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the library today?&quot;  &quot;Yes, I want to get A Midsummer Night&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Dream.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, we went and he did.

Now you know if I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt; suggested he get that book, it would have gone over like a lead<br/>\n&gt; &gt; balloon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then Josh&#39;s obsession with the video game Halo and the movie<br/>\n&gt; Resident<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evil has caused him to get all the paperback books spawned by those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; two, and he has read every one.  Now, I could be complaining that<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was not reading Shakespeare like Ethan, but at least he is<br/>\n&gt; reading!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Which is what is important.  And every now and then, he tries to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; write his own little Halo stories.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Judie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Catch my Ebay Auctions!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unhinderedliving.com/ebaypage.html\">http://www.unhinderedliving.com/ebaypage.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 11 Sep 2003 07:56:46 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: Tim and Maureen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmthomas@...\">tmthomas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: spelling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t know if I caught the total jist of the discussion on spelling but it<br/>\nmade me think of something. My oldest came home from school at 10 yrs old.<br/>\nShe could not spell. My then youngest had done kindergarten. They were<br/>\nintroduced to sounds like spelling. For 1-2 yrs there was very little<br/>\nattempt to do anything requiring spelling or reading by any of the kids. The<br/>\noldest started asking for how to spell, started having me write out her<br/>\ndictated stories,etc...After about a year I noticed there was less asking.<br/>\nAt this point she was writing stories with a passion. She is now 15 and last<br/>\nyear asked for a book on punctuation, and grammar rules for Christmas. She<br/>\nseldom needs help with spelling and seldom misspells now. I did no formal<br/>\ntraining. The ds that learned sounds like spelling would quit spelling if I<br/>\ncorrected his letters at all.I would send his letters to his uncle<br/>\nuncorrected. He is now 11 and began asking for spelling help on his own.What<br/>\nfascinated me was I have seen a pattern for  dd and ds and that was to leave<br/>\nthem alone and only give what they asked for. Now suddenly the 11 yr old has<br/>\ndecided it is important for him to have correct spelling in his letters.<br/>\nThis whole natural learning has really worked here and been very fascinating<br/>\nto watch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maureen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 11 Sep 2003 11:04:51 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:genant2@...\">genant2@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: literacy rate??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/10/03 10:24:04 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RJHill241@...\">RJHill241@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; :<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     I am not ADHD, you just aren&#39;t interesting enough to pay attention<br/>\nto!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I LOVE that.

Why is it<br/>\n&gt; so hard for people who are so keen on spending time with their<br/>\n&gt; children to understand that, for other people, it&#39;s not what they<br/>\n&gt; want to do? They enjoy their jobs, or they enjoy their time out. Not<br/>\n&gt; all kids are unhappy at school. Some kids love it and would hate to<br/>\n&gt; be at home. I know this list is for home schoolers (we do, home<br/>\n&gt; school I mean) and we love it - but I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do it a<br/>\n&gt; few years ago when my career still meant the world to me - as did my<br/>\n&gt; children, but they were happy at school, and I was happy so changing<br/>\n&gt; it wouldn&#39;t have brought us anything better - we would have been<br/>\n&gt; unhappy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, just because I myself was a good student and absolutely LOVED<br/>\n&gt; school and everything about it doesn&#39;t mean that leaving my kids in<br/>\n&gt; school was the right thing.  Could they have continued on in the<br/>\n&gt; school they were in?  Probably....they weren&#39;t getting bad grades,<br/>\n&gt; except my older son in math, but they were already prepared to give<br/>\n&gt; him some kind of business math course in place of Algebra, so he<br/>\n&gt; could have done OK there.  We could have continued on, but I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t in good conscience do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, people who don&#39;t homeschool aren&#39;t &quot;bad&quot; people, but I myself had<br/>\n&gt; to question why I would want to leave my kids in a system that is<br/>\n&gt; squelching their potential, that is literally designed to keep them<br/>\n&gt; from succeeding, to keep them from being free thinkers and from<br/>\n&gt; breaking out of the mold society wants to place them in.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; do it.....I had to give them a chance.  Even if kids in school get<br/>\n&gt; straight A&#39;s, that doesn&#39;t mean school is good for them.  It&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; keeping them from reaching their potential.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 11 Sep 2003 11:49:27 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ejcrewe@...\">ejcrewe@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Parenting changes :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/10/2003 8:45:20 PM Central Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjsolich@...\">mjsolich@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I feel a bit dumb<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I think of all prejudices I have had towards certain books and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; TV<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I struggle with this too, maybe you all can help.
