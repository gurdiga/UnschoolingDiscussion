I ordered it three weeks ago from<br/>\nHolt and Assoc. ONe for me and, on faith, one for my very<br/>\nantihomeschooling mother-in-law. From the annotation in the HOlt catelogue<br/>\nit sounded like the kind of gently persuasive book she would enjoy reading<br/>\nand find herself agreeing with in spite of herself. I&#39;m just so tired of<br/>\narguing with someone who is uninformed. I was surprised she agreed to read<br/>\nsomething about homeschooling b/c she is so absolutely certain that we are<br/>\nruining our children&#39;s lives and that schools are the one and only way.<br/>\nSo, Iguess I&#39;m putting a lot of stock in your book as the first book she&#39;s<br/>\never read on the subject! If she&#39;s willing after reading your book, I&#39;ll<br/>\nsend her some of Holt&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve loved everything you&#39;ve said so far in this chat group and I&#39;m<br/>\nlooking forward to your book.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn &gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3263,"nextTopicId":3281}}
