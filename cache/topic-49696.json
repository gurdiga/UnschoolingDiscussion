They listen and then Dr Phil gives his advice<br/>\nand solves the problem. Viola...mission accomplished.

How does anyone recommend severing a child from a pet as a form of financial responsibilty?  If you didn&#39;t watch the show, then suffice it to say a couple has over-extended themselves horribly, and had approximately 6 pets, one of which was a lizard, the rest cats and dogs.
