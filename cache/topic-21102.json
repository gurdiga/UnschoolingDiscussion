At least the last time I was in Safford, AZ it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nany different than being in NM.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, since NM is getting cooler and wetter (humidity has increased in some<br/>\nareas by 20% over the last century), I&#39;m guessing that maybe that dry, arid,<br/>\ndesolate, dusty and dirty part of the U.S. may be growing just as many<br/>\nmicro-bugs as any swamp.  Particularly when NM already has lots of lovely<br/>\n&quot;bugs&quot; growing there since rodent born diseases are quite prevalent.  Ya<br/>\nknow, charming things like hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.  And your Lung<br/>\nAssociation warns about Valley Fever and some nasty asthma problems<br/>\nassociated with NM&#39;s cockroach infestation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, NM does have bosque riparian forests and wetlands which swamp loving<br/>\nbugs just adore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, generally speaking (we&#39;ll leave out Antarctica and the North Pole) the<br/>\nmath remains the same for most geographic locations, 1 (dryer) + 1 (wet<br/>\nclothes) = 2 (humidity) with the extension of said math being 1 (dryer) + 1<br/>\n(lack of regular lint removal) + 1 (humidity) = 3 (pockets of damp lint that<br/>\nsome bacteria and allergins just happen to love).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, your *opinion* that &quot;nothing&quot; is growing on or in a dryer residing in NM<br/>\nis hardly based in fact.  Facts are, dust mites and many other &quot;bugs&quot; are<br/>\nalive and well in NM.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; .
