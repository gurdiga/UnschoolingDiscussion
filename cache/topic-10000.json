I have been reading the list for many months because I<br/>\n&gt; wanted to see what it is all about before jumping in. I have learned<br/>\n&gt; so much from all of you as I am always still learning and tempering<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; way of living/teaching our children. My name is Elisabeth and I live<br/>\n&gt; in California. We have been living the hs lifestyle for about 13<br/>\n&gt; years<br/>\n&gt; now. We have 5 wonderful ( aren&#39;t they all?!) children who have never<br/>\n&gt; been to school due to the new things we were introduced to when we<br/>\n&gt; attended a hs conference when our oldest was only 6 months old, then<br/>\n&gt; read the Moore&#39;s books over and over again and hung out with<br/>\n&gt; &quot;experienced &quot; homeschool families at Park days during the toddler/<br/>\n&gt; early elementary years.<br/>\n&gt; Just recently I listened to some tapes that a friend loaned me from a<br/>\n&gt; conference that the Moore&#39;s gave in the early 90&#39;s. I found this to<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; so helpful. Have any of you read their books? Have many of you<br/>\n&gt; followed their outline of the Moore Formula? What are your<br/>\n&gt; experiences?<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;d think that by now I&#39;d have it all figured out but not so as it<br/>\n&gt; is taking me a long time to unlearn the things that I learned about<br/>\n&gt; hs<br/>\n&gt; early on from the Protestant-type hs. Yes, My son and I suffered<br/>\n&gt; through using Rod and Staff one year- it was awful!!!!! Then we tried<br/>\n&gt; Sonlight, this was much nicer but too scheduled to really work in our<br/>\n&gt; life (the books were great!) Well, it has been about four years now<br/>\n&gt; and we are finally starting to come to a place where we are all<br/>\n&gt; comfortable and doing what we need to be doing. One of the most<br/>\n&gt; important things I have seen and learned is this:Negative Peer<br/>\n&gt; pressure whether it is youthful or in adult frienships is not healthy<br/>\n&gt; for the development of healthy families/people/little people.<br/>\n&gt; I look forward to taking part in the list.<br/>\n&gt; Blessings,Elisabeth </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kOIe-3GuNtynW-r2t-ddmgcyNYSdqtBlX5y3UTb8jDcIPuLucncjmiNLhOtbn1wFpwJprPtqsjU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unlearning","postDate":"962042757","msgId":10000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNiLjcwNjQzYTEuMjY4OGY1ODVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10055,"prevInTime":9999,"nextInTime":10001,"topicId":10000,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Elizabeth...
