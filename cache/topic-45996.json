Fear, pain, insecurity, maybe even sensing <br/>\nhis mother&#39;s sadness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read that anytime the unborn baby feels like it is in danger <br/>\nor is in pain, the baby will secrete the same hormones that we <br/>\nsecrete when we&#39;re in danger or in pain.  I&#39;ve read that autopsies of <br/>\naborted babies show very high levels of the hormones we secrete when <br/>\nwe have very high levels of fear and pain.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have also read in books and articles on holistic health that trauma <br/>\nin the womb can affect the baby&#39;s physical and emotional well-being <br/>\nonce born.  For example, hearing and sensing his mother in pain or <br/>\nconstantly weeping.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; <br/>\n&lt;stephanie.elms@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OK.
