You&#39;re not alone in that situation. My husband was initially wary <br/>\nof homeschooling until he saw the results. Then when I told him we were <br/>\nphasing over to unschooling he thought I was crazy but acknowledged that I <br/>\nwas the one who had done the research and so I probably had more information <br/>\nto make a good decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is easier for my husband because our oldest daughter is clearly <br/>\nflourishing under this method of education. She also has chosen a very <br/>\nacademic path. He can see the value in almost all of her activities. While he <br/>\nis still not comfortable with complete unschooling, he sees that she is well <br/>\nbeyond what she would be doing in a public or most private schools. He sees <br/>\nthat she is passionate about learning new things and is very well adjusted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t know any other unschooling families, so he has no examples, good or <br/>\nbad, to look at. Perhaps your husband would be interested in reading some of <br/>\nbooks about unschooling and its affects. Perhaps a subscription to Growing <br/>\nWithout Schooling may help. Maybe you could ask if he would be comfortable <br/>\nunschooling on a trial basis, and reassessing at the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are his specific fears and concerns? <br/>\n<br/>\ncandice</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bill & Sher","from":"&quot;Bill & Sher&quot; &lt;yet_will_i_trust.him@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"T6sNic67GZpFEqlQtcdVkwgMmBx-YBum18xRVGDltquU7MyO5Yg3yLJqFsiUi4pmCn-P2nna6TBL-mUNVxW__bJjXxvpDRg-TZmV-78DysDCj3vOU6PikZsz","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"help convincing hubby","postDate":"972417346","msgId":13769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFHUFBCT1BDRENBR0FBQUFAc2hhcmVkMS1tYWlsLndob3doZXJlLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13770,"prevInTime":13768,"nextInTime":13770,"topicId":13769,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes you all are right.
