States<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reporting, to assure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>progressing.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;discourage parents from teaching their children in their home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attention for children. It can also increase parental<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; involvement in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their children&#39;s lives. These elements are essential to improving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;education for our children attending public schools as well. My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;administration would be fully committed to making sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more students in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;public schools get individual attention through Head<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Start, voluntary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;universal preschool, and smaller classes. I wish you and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great success in home schooling.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-xB2kOY9WbOBGokT85Ks3Xc4s_MsWyf3rYVvBA3WvWbE9p-IZevV8ah-Fzi-PdZjvqXIntrBjwywHQusgbAyz_5btQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Gore&#39;s response on hs question - long","postDate":"970493604","msgId":13578,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAxMDAyMTMzMy5lOTJEWDM4MDUyMTNAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":13575,"nextInTopic":13579,"prevInTime":13577,"nextInTime":13579,"topicId":13571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Before believing that homeschooling will be flexible under the shrub, take a close look at Florida and who the shrub thinks walks on water (H$LDA).

As you well know,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parents are a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;child&#39;s first teachers. Home schooling is a growing effort by many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;parents to direct the education of their children. There<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are no U.S.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Department of Education regulations related to home<br/>\n&gt; &gt; schooling. States<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reporting, to assure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and progressing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;discourage parents from teaching their children in their home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase<br/>\n&gt; &gt; individual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attention for children. It can also increase parental<br/>\n&gt; &gt; involvement in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their children&#39;s lives. These elements are essential to improving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;education for our children attending public schools as well. My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;administration would be fully committed to making sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more students in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;public schools get individual attention through Head<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Start, voluntary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;universal preschool, and smaller classes. I wish you and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great success in home schooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonnie Painter","from":"&quot;Bonnie Painter&quot; &lt;bonniepainter@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4jCpVX48X-3GNbBRoCWHKm43bivhoF49C0x7wohSA-Eicl7cyVSEPorSi7NRdfmWuf6_-R7_bHWSaTKLScRgG2QHQSHaQ4cr3R6uk29a5H6whO8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Gore&#39;s response on hs question - long","postDate":"970418466","msgId":13575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyMTF6M0ZCMUZ4UUZNODNVVjgwMDAwOGQyZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13573,"nextInTopic":13578,"prevInTime":13574,"nextInTime":13576,"topicId":13571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t see any quotable sources (besides unnamed) to support what you are saying.

The NEA (National Education Association - the largest<br/>\n&gt;teachers union)has nearly 2.5 million members and the AFT (American<br/>\n&gt;Federation of Teachers - another union) has more than 1 million members. In<br/>\n&gt;the sphere of political influence, these two unions are extremely well<br/>\n&gt;funded, represent 3.5 million members, and influence many people because<br/>\n&gt;they have the image of representing &quot;education&quot; rather than being seen as a<br/>\n&gt;unions that represents teachers. They have been against school choice,<br/>\n&gt;accountability for teachers, charter schools, public money to support any<br/>\n&gt;form of education other than government run schools, and school reform.<br/>\n&gt;Their primary mantra is that all the educational problems would be solved <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;more money was given to government run schools and teachers. (Private <br/>\n&gt;school<br/>\n&gt;teachers are paid less than government school teachers and that the cost of<br/>\n&gt;attending private school is less per student than the cost of government<br/>\n&gt;school. Most people agree that private schools are doing better than the<br/>\n&gt;government schools, so how can more money be the issue?)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let&#39;s look at what Gore said in his response and I think you will see that<br/>\n&gt;the words reveal some biases. Applying a Clintonesque interpretation of the<br/>\n&gt;meaning of words, I see the following:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; States<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reporting, to assure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and progressing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So he would do nothing to alter states that have set parameters like <br/>\n&gt;testing<br/>\n&gt;and reporting, but is the statement carefully worded to allow changes in<br/>\n&gt;states that do not require testing or reporting?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase individual<br/>\n&gt;attention for &gt; &gt; &gt;children. It can also increase parental involvement in<br/>\n&gt;their children&#39;s lives.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;These elements are essential to improving education for our children<br/>\n&gt;attending<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;public schools as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does anybody else detect that typical bias that sure, some people can<br/>\n&gt;homeschool successfully, but not many? How many opponents to homeschooling<br/>\n&gt;start off with saying that homeschooling can be very successful for &quot;some&quot;<br/>\n&gt;families followed by a &quot;but&quot; and their list of objections. Notice that Gore<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t even say that homeschooling can be successful, only that it can<br/>\n&gt;increase &quot;individual attention&quot; on the children and increase parental<br/>\n&gt;involvement.

Homeschooling is but one of the factors you must evaluate when deciding who to vote","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-615762767\">I don&#39;t think anyone should cast their vote on the basis of a single issue.<br/>\nHomeschooling is but one of the factors you must evaluate when deciding who<br/>\nto vote for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this is a homeschooling forum, I will stay away from other issues and<br/>\npoint out the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost 1 in 10 of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are<br/>\nmembers of the NEA. The NEA (National Education Association - the largest<br/>\nteachers union)has nearly 2.5 million members and the AFT (American<br/>\nFederation of Teachers - another union) has more than 1 million members. In<br/>\nthe sphere of political influence, these two unions are extremely well<br/>\nfunded, represent 3.5 million members, and influence many people because<br/>\nthey have the image of representing &quot;education&quot; rather than being seen as a<br/>\nunions that represents teachers. They have been against school choice,<br/>\naccountability for teachers, charter schools, public money to support any<br/>\nform of education other than government run schools, and school reform.<br/>\nTheir primary mantra is that all the educational problems would be solved if<br/>\nmore money was given to government run schools and teachers. (Private school<br/>\nteachers are paid less than government school teachers and that the cost of<br/>\nattending private school is less per student than the cost of government<br/>\nschool. Most people agree that private schools are doing better than the<br/>\ngovernment schools, so how can more money be the issue?)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s look at what Gore said in his response and I think you will see that<br/>\nthe words reveal some biases. Applying a Clintonesque interpretation of the<br/>\nmeaning of words, I see the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; States<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>\n&gt; reporting, to assure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and progressing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So he would do nothing to alter states that have set parameters like testing<br/>\nand reporting, but is the statement carefully worded to allow changes in<br/>\nstates that do not require testing or reporting?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase individual<br/>\n </span></blockquote>attention for &gt; &gt; &gt;children. It can also increase parental involvement in<br/>\ntheir children&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt;These elements are essential to improving education for our children<br/>\n </span></blockquote>attending<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt;public schools as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does anybody else detect that typical bias that sure, some people can<br/>\nhomeschool successfully, but not many? How many opponents to homeschooling<br/>\nstart off with saying that homeschooling can be very successful for &quot;some&quot;<br/>\nfamilies followed by a &quot;but&quot; and their list of objections. Notice that Gore<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even say that homeschooling can be successful, only that it can<br/>\nincrease &quot;individual attention&quot; on the children and increase parental<br/>\ninvolvement. He mentions that these are important for public school kids<br/>\ntoo, and immediately uses that to segue into his initiatives for government<br/>\nschools.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his response, Gore does not use any adjectives to describe homeschooling.<br/>\nHe seems to be very careful to not say anything positive about it, while not<br/>\nbeing negative either.<br/>\n<br/>\nClinton and Gore have been very reserved about homeschooling and have<br/>\nexpressed<br/>\nconcerns that while it can work out fine, accountability needs to be in<br/>\nplace to make sure the parents are doing their job.<br/>\n<br/>\nClinton said while he would not choose it for his own child, home schooling<br/>\ncan work well when students and parents are made to answer for the students&#39;<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We should say, &#39;Look, there&#39;s a good way to do this and a not-so-good way<br/>\nto do this,&quot;&#39; and require that home-schooled students meet academic<br/>\nbenchmarks, he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But if you&#39;re going to do this,&quot; he added, &quot;your children have to prove<br/>\nthat they&#39;re learning on a regular basis, and if they don&#39;t prove that<br/>\nthey&#39;re learning then they have to go into a school -- either into a<br/>\nparochial or private school or a public school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Gore campaign has criticized Bush&#39;s stance on homeschooling as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n   &quot;Bush has repeatedly called for more accountability in public schools,<br/>\n    but has made no effort to apply those standards to home schooled<br/>\n    children. In Texas, Bush has supported home schooling, despite the<br/>\n    fact that Texas mandates no regulations on attendance or achievement<br/>\n    standards for home schooled students and requires no certification<br/>\n    for home school teachers. Texas officials have even criticized the<br/>\n    Texas system for offering the parents of truant children a way to get<br/>\n    around the system without actually educating their children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGore has even been against vouchers and school choice because of the<br/>\ninfluence of the NEA, and Liberman had to retreat from his long held stance<br/>\nof supporting vouchers once he got the VP nomination.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe record in Texas (which has one of the least restrictive homeschooling<br/>\nlaws in the nation) is a pretty good indicator of the Bush attitude about<br/>\nhomeschooling. Bush has a strong stand on public school accountability,<br/>\nwhich I do not see as a conflict. Schools should be held accountable to<br/>\nparents who are entrusting them to educate their children. Most parents with<br/>\nchildren in public schools would definitely want that school accountable for<br/>\ntheir education efforts. However, parents who take full responsibility for<br/>\nthe education of their own children do not have to be held to the same<br/>\nstandards. They are providing a service for themselves and their own<br/>\nchildren and can judge if it is meeting their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some comments by someone who lived in Gore&#39;s home state:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I lived in TN a few years ago when we were putting in a mobile home on some<br/>\n&gt;land.  I swear we had to get a permit for blowing our noses!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;to homeschool your elementary kids was pretty simple, just<br/>\n&gt;have a high-school diploma or GED and tell what curriculum you&#39;ll be using<br/>\n&gt;to school your child(ren), *but* unless you had your BA you couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;homeschool your middle or high schoolers unless you had an umbrella school.<br/>\n&gt;TN seemed to be extremely regulated in all areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the area of education, I think it is clear that one candidate wants to<br/>\nfocus on improving government education and one candidate wants to focus on<br/>\nimproving education opportunities in a variety of formats.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some links:<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers for Bush<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.home.com/hsforbush2000/\">http://members.home.com/hsforbush2000/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBush letter in response to questions about homeschooling<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.home.com/hsforbush2000/Bush%20Letter%20to%20Home%20School%20M\">http://members.home.com/hsforbush2000/Bush%20Letter%20to%20Home%20School%20M</a><br/>\nom.htm<br/>\n<br/>\nGore response to questions about homeschooling (second letter)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.algore.com/townhall/th_education.html\">http://www.algore.com/townhall/th_education.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDemocratic attack on Bush homeschooling stance<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.democrats.org/gopwatch/bushwatch/accountability/home.html\">http://www.democrats.org/gopwatch/bushwatch/accountability/home.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLink to parody of NEA homeschooling resolutions along with a link to actual<br/>\nNEA resolutions<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.org/resolutions.htm\">http://www.unschooling.org/resolutions.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, I should also add that I think the President can strongly<br/>\ninfluence the atmosphere and attitude toward homeschooling, but I do not<br/>\nthink you need to be concerned that the legality of homeschooling will be<br/>\nimmediately affected by the outcome of the election.<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those that have been worried about Gore&#39;s stand on<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling, this<br/>\n&gt; should answer the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From another list:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.algore.com/townhall/th_education.html\">http://www.algore.com/townhall/th_education.html</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Fwd: Re: [homeschooling_preK-K] Gore&#39;s Response to HSing ??<br/>\n&gt; &gt; **&gt;Town Hall Question<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Yvonne, thank you for visiting my website and asking an important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;question about educating our children.
