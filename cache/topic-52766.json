You could stay underground (I definitely WON&#39;T <br/>\nsnitch).  That testing requirement is every other year and can start in <br/>\neither fourth grade or fifth grade.  I&#39;m not sure how old your young&#39;uns <br/>\nare, but if you&#39;re only going to be in New York for one year, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nsweat it.  All those requirements can be annoying, but everything depends <br/>\non the school district around here.  I just happen to have (whispering, <br/>\nhere) a rather apathetic school district who couldn&#39;t care less about <br/>\nme.  Some of them, though, seem to have something to prove and they try to <br/>\nget in your face, or so I understand.  I was going to stay underground, but <br/>\nfor some reason that I can&#39;t remember now I chickened out and sent in the <br/>\nrequired letter of intent and individualized home instruction plan (&quot;I plan <br/>\nto wear my pajamas until 1 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and alternating <br/>\nThursdays...&quot;).  But, I had help on all the other paperwork stuff, and I&#39;m <br/>\njust skating along.  The school district (whispering here again) never <br/>\ncontacts me or acknowledges my paperwork.  Great!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking of fleeing the country anyway because of all the madness, so <br/>\nmaybe we&#39;ll never have to deal with the testing requirement and the <br/>\nsmallpox vaccination requirement and all the other weird horrors that seem <br/>\nto be coming down the pike...
