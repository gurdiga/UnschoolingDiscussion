This <br/>\nhas got to be the dumbest book I&#39;ve ever seen--and my kids LOVE it! I <br/>\nwould have gotten rid of it right away if it&#39;d been up to me, but no! <br/>\nThey have to have it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if a lot of the difference of whether kids like these really <br/>\ndumb &quot;Bob&quot; type VERY easy readers has to do with how old the kids are <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re learning to read. I&#39;m almost embarrassed on these boards to <br/>\nsay my kids are learning to read young, but they are, and they love <br/>\nthese very easy books. (Not the Bob ones, though. I found one in the <br/>\nlibrary about trains and it was the only train book Brian has ever not <br/>\nloved.) My kids are not at all put off by the lack of sophistication in <br/>\nthese books. They liked Sleepy Dog and his ilk even before they started <br/>\nlearning to decode the words.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reading his gameboy was my son&#39;s definition of when he could read.  Not when<br/>\n&gt;he read Sleepy Dog, a very stupid (but much beloved) beginning reader that<br/>\n&gt;my Mom sent which was his first book, or any of those easy books. <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44495,"nextTopicId":44526}}
