I will be<br/>\nglad <br/>\nwhen there is more participation from<br/>\nmore members.  But I have to say I think that will not<br/>\nhappen <br/>\nuntil we bring the number of member bashing comments (like<br/>\nthe <br/>\nendless cycle of Linda&#39;s list comments) and judgemental<br/>\nre-hashings<br/>\nto a minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined this list back when it first started and have<br/>\ncontinued to <br/>\ncome back to it not because I expect everyone to always<br/>\nagree<br/>\nwith me but because I expect to see different sides and<br/>\nperceptions<br/>\nto every argument presented with love and sincerity.  I may<br/>\nnot always<br/>\nagree with every thought presented here ( and recently have<br/>\nbeen a bit<br/>\ndisappointed by what has appeared to be a lack of tolerance<br/>\nfor each other)<br/>\n but I am glad to participate  in a forum that allows for<br/>\nand actually encourages <br/>\nunschoolers and homeschoolers alike to express themselves,<br/>\nbetter themselves and<br/>\nrespect themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many places are there for an unschooler/homeschooler to<br/>\nthink and learn and grow<br/>\nand feel free to be themselves?  This list is a valuable<br/>\ntool.  I think each of us has something <br/>\nto contribute and as long as we remember that and respect<br/>\nthat and each other this list<br/>\nwill thrive, regardless of who is on/off it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents, Jacli :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 1<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Sun, 25 Nov 2001 11:14:57 -0000<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Kathy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurawilder82@...\">laurawilder82@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: A breath of fresh air<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The membership has dropped by 11 so far.
