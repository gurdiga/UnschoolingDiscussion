I find I am a happier person if I focus on the good.  I<br/>\ntry to show children as much happiness as I can.  This includes not<br/>\nadding additional stress to an already stressful world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I really think your comment about a husband was silly, to say the<br/>\n&gt; least.<br/>\n&gt; If nothing else, it was non-responsive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry you thought it was silly.  I thought it was demonstrating that<br/>\nno one needs to impose stress on another individual.  I was actually<br/>\ntrying to be a little funny.  Poor attempt, I suppose.  Stress, and<br/>\ndon&#39;t we know it as mothers, comes naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As to a child going to sleep when they are tired, that is not a given<br/>\n&gt; nor is<br/>\n&gt; it even a norm, including infants.  That happens in some children and<br/>\n&gt; in a<br/>\n&gt; perfect world without outside stimuli.  Hey, I&#39;m betting that is why<br/>\n&gt; mothers<br/>\n&gt; try to make a quiet space for infants to sleep in, ya know, no loud<br/>\n&gt; noises,<br/>\n&gt; pull the blinds, that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, many children fall asleep in a sling with the whole world<br/>\ndoing its thing right around their heads.  I know kids who sleep through<br/>\ndogs, siblings, talking, etc.  A lot of mothers choose to use a sling<br/>\nfor this reason alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I&#39;m glad you know one child who does this.  I&#39;ve known dozens that<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; And quite a few that get so tired that they can make themselves<br/>\n&gt; physically<br/>\n&gt; ill.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  I thought falling asleep was natural.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes it is a positive thing for someone to be looking out for the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; well-being of another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I feel that I go above and beyond the call of looking out for the<br/>\nwell-being of others.  In fact, I think many parents don&#39;t look at what,<br/>\nexactly, looking out for one&#39;s own means.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Of course, that would be in a world where everything<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t black and white.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I actually believe the world is many shades of gray.  Choosing to try to<br/>\nfind common preferences for all involved takes a lot of work.  It also<br/>\naccounts for many personality styles and wishes.  Taking individual<br/>\npreferences into account is definitely not a black and white issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The problem here is that all children are not the same and your ideas<br/>\n&gt; are no<br/>\n&gt; different than ps and are exactly what you are railing against others<br/>\n&gt; about--arbitrary.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry.  I don&#39;t understand this statement.  I understand that every<br/>\nchild is a unique individual.  Common preferences honor the individual.<br/>\nThis is not about the easiest solution for the parent.  This is about<br/>\nthe action that will make all involved truly happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Each child needs to be looked at as an individual.  What<br/>\n&gt; works for one may not work for another.  What works for one style of<br/>\n&gt; parenting may not work for another.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not talking about one style of parenting.  I am talking about<br/>\napproaching each person as an individual.  If you think each child<br/>\nshould be approached differently, as an individual, and with care, we<br/>\nmust be on the same page, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What may be defined as a &quot;spoiled brat&quot;<br/>\n&gt; in one person&#39;s eyes may be just peachy in another&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s true.  Most people I know that genuinely are looking out<br/>\nfor my best interests, strive to help me be happy, talk to me honestly,<br/>\nare involved with me in the moment, emulate the good they see in others,<br/>\nand are pretty happy themselves don&#39;t strike me as spoiled brats.  To<br/>\neach his own, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And boundaries are not the only environment that creates bullies.  One<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; the worst little creeps in our neighborhood was raised exactly as you<br/>\n&gt; describe--loving, nurturing, family meetings to make decisions,<br/>\n&gt; homeschooled, no coersion, etc., etc., etc.  This kid is sly and he is<br/>\n&gt; nasty<br/>\n&gt; and he has parent manipulation down to a fine science.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>His parents are probably self-sacrificing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As I said, it isn&#39;t all black and white and any given parenting method<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work the same on all children, nor will it work for all children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly.  That is why I am advocating that each parent look at each<br/>\nchild as an individual with individual desires which make that child<br/>\nhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BAuB1y2kGmctHu3tVNrHlbPNpn9oZ7qLi24EBGmmz3lhTAUlSqW90LoiVWNvqxkhdDH1Oq-wbH15nL5h4cL118oMsWAWrbQ8MvVw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[Unschooling-dotcom] Brain atrophy","postDate":"990116111","msgId":21347,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNTE3MTYxNTExLjgwMjAxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4OTk5NjQ3MC4xMTgzLjQ4ODAzLmwxMEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21341,"nextInTopic":21356,"prevInTime":21346,"nextInTime":21348,"topicId":21321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Nobody needs to impose it upon them.

I agree with the above, childhood is stressful,<br/>\nin the extreme.  Learning about the world, making<br/>\nembarrassing and painful mistakes, being treated<br/>\npoorly by adults and other children alike sometimes,<br/>\nand being constantly subjected to the will of others<br/>\nis very stressful indeed.  I have very strong and<br/>\ndistinct memories of my childhood, going back to age<br/>\ntwo, before which my memory is spotty.  I REMEMBER<br/>\nwhat it feels like to be a child, and so I have<br/>\nsympathy for children and try to see things from their<br/>\npoint of view. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When I hear of grown unschoolers, free schoolers,<br/>\n&gt;and adults with relatively easy childhoods, I hear<br/>\n&gt;of  people who seem happy and fulfilled..........that<br/>\n&gt;bounce back from the burns and social ostracism<br/>\n&gt;because these are the people with high self<br/>\n&gt;esteems, ...........These are the people who can<br/>\n&gt;handle<br/>\n&gt;challenges because boundaries  weren&#39;t arbitrarily<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;crammed down their throats.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere again, I agree.  I came from a two parent, upper<br/>\nmiddle class home.  But I had a terrible childhood,<br/>\nbecause my home was also dysfunctional, abusive and<br/>\nalcoholic.  My father was the disciplinarian, and you<br/>\nhad to walk around him on eggshells, never knowing<br/>\nwhen his own stressful day or the wrong word or deed<br/>\nwould set off a beating or screaming tirade directed<br/>\nat you.  But my father was also over emotional<br/>\n(particularly when drunk), physically affectionate,<br/>\nand expressed interest in our education.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was the ultimate in disinterested.  She had<br/>\nher &quot;things&quot; and her social circle and could really<br/>\ncare less what we did.  She had no identity or self<br/>\nesteem of her own, and no backbone.  When Dad was<br/>\nworking or away on business, which was often, we ran<br/>\nwild, went where we wanted, were gone for days on end,<br/>\nthrew wild parties, and so on.  Mom either was not<br/>\naround or did not care enough to fight with us.  She<br/>\nnever disciplined us, ever.  She often called me names<br/>\nlike &quot;stupid little slut&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot; but never<br/>\nenforced any rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you can see that I had both extremes.  The totally<br/>\nuninvolved and non-disciplining parent, and the<br/>\noverbearing athoritarian parent.  Both were terrible. <br/>\nI grew up hating my father for abusing and controlling<br/>\nme, and hating my mother for not caring and not<br/>\nacting.  Neither one felt supportive, and I grew up<br/>\nwith poor self esteem, poor anger management, and very<br/>\nlittle ability to deal with stress, which I recieved<br/>\nin such great quantity.  Not until my life was<br/>\nhappier, and I had done a great deal of healing and<br/>\nreversal of the damage of my childhood was I better<br/>\nable to deal with stress.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is still a daily struggle, not to let the little<br/>\nthings overwhelm me.  As the child of an alcoholic, I<br/>\ndeal with a lot of guilt, anger, loss and depression. <br/>\nI have had depression since I was a toddler.  When I<br/>\nwas still growing up, every little thing would send me<br/>\nquaking and sobbing.  Now that I have a happy home and<br/>\nhealthy relationships around me, I have that resevoir<br/>\nof strength from which to draw upon to help me through<br/>\nthe stress of daily life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; My son, for instance, finds it extremely stressful<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to talk about or deal with learning social skills<br/>\n&gt;&gt;such as meeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies,<br/>\n&gt;&gt;making friendly advances to people, etc... but if I<br/>\n&gt;&gt;indulge him in his avoidant behavior he will not<br/>\n&gt;&gt;learn these things,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you really think of it as indulgant to let your<br/>\nchild be who he is, and express himself the way he<br/>\nfeels comfortable?  I was not a shy child, and spoke<br/>\nmy mind (still do) sometimes to my detriment, and<br/>\nstepped right up to do drama, debate and spelling<br/>\nbees.  But I have learned from life, and my many<br/>\nhurts, to be more reticent, to hold back, to make<br/>\nfriends slowly and be shy in large groups or with new<br/>\npeople.  My parents were always telling everyone that<br/>\nI was NOT SHY, and I was so bold, and I talked a lot,<br/>\nand wasn&#39;t I a good little hostess and wasn&#39;t I funny.<br/>\n They forced me to answer the door for their large<br/>\ncompany parties (100-300 people) and for smaller<br/>\ndinner parties and social events.  They made me give<br/>\nintroductions and take coats and make conversation<br/>\nwith strange adults.  I am uncomfortable with my level<br/>\nof socail interaction and am an artificially<br/>\nintroverted person.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was almost cripplingly shy as a child,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t speak up, had few friends, was awkward and<br/>\nreserved.  He still is very shy and quiet, but has<br/>\nlearned, in his own time and way, to talk openly, make<br/>\nfriends, joke with acquaintances, and deal with larger<br/>\nsocial settings without TOO much discomfort.  He had a<br/>\nrelatively loving and happy childhood, with supportive<br/>\nparents who did not push him to be and do more than he<br/>\nwanted.  He is comfortable with his level of<br/>\ninteraction and will always be an introverted person.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have one child who is very gregarious and<br/>\nextroverted, dynamic and flambouyant.  We have another<br/>\nwho is just like his father, very sweet, and shy,<br/>\nquiet and sensative.  I let them both be who they are,<br/>\nand some days my &quot;introvert&quot; will talk off the ear of<br/>\nanother diner in a restaurant and my &quot;extrovert&quot; will<br/>\nhide his face against me and not want to talk to his<br/>\nown cousin.  I assume they will take on as much as<br/>\nthey are comfotable with in the course of their lives.<br/>\n If they do not like speaking in public, in front of<br/>\ncrowds, than they will avoid it and if they like to<br/>\nact or perform in public they will seek it.  To each<br/>\nhis own, and there is not a &quot;required&quot; amount of<br/>\nsocial interaction in our culture.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Or maybe, just like talking or walking, he would<br/>\n&gt;learn these things on his own, when he felt &gt;ready.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here again, I agree, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Grandmothers in our family, for instance, love to have<br/>\n&gt; the opportunity to come play with a child while parents run errands.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes parent prefers to leave a child who doesn&#39;t like errands at<br/>\n&gt; home or with a neighbor who likes trading child care.  In this case, the<br/>\n&gt; decision to go to the store alone is a common preference.  Again, I am<br/>\n&gt; not advocating sacrifice on the behalf of anyone.  The goal is to find a<br/>\n&gt; preference for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather than explaining to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child that s/he is part of a family/wider community<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and that compromise is sometimes necessary in order to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; promote the common good and in order to incline others<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to occasionally compromise on your behalf *is*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; permissive parenting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am happy for you, if compromise works for you.  I tend to try to find<br/>\n&gt; a way which allows *everyone* to get what they want.  Lots of creative<br/>\n&gt; ideas may eliminate the need for sacrifice on any person&#39;s part.  It is<br/>\n&gt; not permissive parenting, if all parties are happy with the outcome.<br/>\n&gt; Even the gentle permissive parenting the &quot;studies&quot; refer to, involves<br/>\n&gt; parental sacrifice for the good of the child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It fits the definition of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; permissive parenting provided by the studies, which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; may in your case not impose stress on your family, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; which has been shown is studies to frequently result<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in stress for the entire family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; See above.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And while your example seems reasonable to you, it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seems arbitrary and unfair to me, as it involves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respecting the wishes of one person over the wishes of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; others either on the basis of age or on the basis of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their having originated from your body.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once again, the wishes of *everyone* are weighed equally and the goal is<br/>\n&gt; to find a preference which each person finds genuinely appealing and<br/>\n&gt; preferable.  The child is not given any more or less respect than the<br/>\n&gt; adults.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; According to the descriptions in the studies, all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; three parenting styles *can* take children very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seriously indeed, and taking children and their needs<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seriously is inherent in the Authoritative approach.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still claim that imposing artificial boundaries is not taking children<br/>\n&gt; seriously.  I call that lying.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If one is going to get meaning out of studies, one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; must use their definition of terms.  We could say that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their studies are not useful because they use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different definitions than *you* would use... but then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what useful conclusions could be reached thereby?  You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were the one who said you would be interested to read<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the studies, I provided some sources.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want a study that says children need parents to impose stress.  The<br/>\n&gt; authors to which you refer talk about parenting styles.  None, that I am<br/>\n&gt; aware of, say, &quot;Jane needs a parent to give her stress in order to<br/>\n&gt; handle the world effectively.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sometimes preferences are *not* common, and then one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; must either give to one side, the other, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; compromise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I assert there is always a way to find a common preference.  Again, I<br/>\n&gt; urge you to read through this site:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/index.html\">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/index.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You are, at least in your example,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; consistantly giving in to the whims/wishes of one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person and inconveniencing others in the process.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never &quot;give in.&quot;  I never &quot;let&quot; my child win.  I try to make sure that<br/>\n&gt; I am happy with the outcomes of our decisions.  I try to make sure I am<br/>\n&gt; not self-sacrificing (which I believe begets resentment, but that is<br/>\n&gt; another post).  I don&#39;t believe I have ever inconvenienced another<br/>\n&gt; person in this approach to parenting.  We may have to sit and think<br/>\n&gt; creatively for some time before a common preference is reached, but when<br/>\n&gt; we really try, we have always succeeded.  I am not saying that I am<br/>\n&gt; perfect.  I have imposed my will before.  I have, in that circumstance,<br/>\n&gt; said I was sorry and began brainstorming better solutions for future<br/>\n&gt; similar circumstances.  I am still learning.  I hope I am always<br/>\n&gt; searching for better ways to interact with the special people in my<br/>\n&gt; life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That is not equitable treatment.  It goes beyond<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;taking children seriously&#39;... or perhaps takes *them*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seriously but doesn&#39;t take anyone *else* seriously.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What is your definition of narcissism?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Actually, it takes everyone seriously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In what way do you think that people who choose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different ways of dealing with children than yourself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *not* involved moment by moment in their child&#39;s life<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or *not* striving to make the lives of all involved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe imposing one&#39;s will doesn&#39;t make people happy.

Hey, I&#39;m betting that is why mothers<br/>\ntry to make a quiet space for infants to sleep in, ya know, no loud noises,<br/>\npull the blinds, that sort of thing.

Can you see how the world offers a<br/>\n&gt; fair amount of stress naturally?  Why the need for artificial<br/>\n&gt; boundaries?  Would you like it if your husband, say, thought you needed<br/>\n&gt; just a little more stress because, well, you hadn&#39;t learned it well<br/>\n&gt; enough when you were a child?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and believe that simple lessons in living in the real world<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be taught?  What, &quot;he took my toy&quot; or &quot;waaaa, my Barbie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; broke?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t believe that simple lessons are not learned.  Sometimes a broken<br/>\n&gt; toy is lesson enough... I don&#39;t need to teach that.  What, exactly, is<br/>\n&gt; your question?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As to being sent to bed when a parent determined the time, there are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than one type of doing this.  The arbitrary, &quot;it is 9 p.m., you will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bed&quot; and the parent who is aware of a child who gets beyond the point<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knowing their are tired and keeps going like they are in a race with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Energizer bunny.  I have one of those and I send her to bed.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; minute her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; head hits the pillow she is out.  If you don&#39;t send her to bed, she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; physically ill.  I&#39;m thinking the &quot;stress&quot; of being sent to bed is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for her than the &quot;stress&quot; of vomiting and spending a day in bed with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why does one make themselves sick when they are tired?  Certainly this<br/>\n&gt; is not typical behavior.  I actually know a two year old who has had a<br/>\n&gt; complete absence of coercion regarding bedtime.  She will say she is<br/>\n&gt; tired at 7:30 or 10:30, when she is tired.  She walks herself to bed and<br/>\n&gt; may or may not ask for an adult to accompany her.  Certainly a person<br/>\n&gt; will be able to determine how tired they feel.  A brand new infant<br/>\n&gt; sleeps when he or she is tired, no one had to teach this baby how to<br/>\n&gt; sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And, children do not &quot;naturally&quot; use phrases such as &quot;please&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;thank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are you sure?  A child mimics behavior of adults naturally.  That is how<br/>\n&gt; they learn to talk, walk, eat, etc.  I know children who say please and<br/>\n&gt; thank you naturally.  They also like to discuss manners and occasionally<br/>\n&gt; experiment with exceedingly good manners to see people smile, act<br/>\n&gt; impressed, or give them a compliment.  Children, I believe, are born<br/>\n&gt; inherently good, they like to see people smile, feel proud of<br/>\n&gt; themselves, have friends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Quite frankly, without any of the very minimal boundaries talked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about, I&#39;m not thinking the child is going to grow up to be a very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;nice&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Frankly, children with truths behind them seem nicer than very coerced<br/>\n&gt; and controlled children who may be bullies in the absence of adults.<br/>\n&gt; These children are able to talk intelligently about being nice or being<br/>\n&gt; mean.  But, really, the point is not whether or not they are nice, but<br/>\n&gt; rather if they are respected as individuals and complete beings.<br/>\n&gt; Children who see respect, learn it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Part of the problem, IMHO, with the world today is that society is too<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; narcistic.  Parents who lived through WWII went out of their way to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; give, give to their kids and now we seeing a whole load of folks that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; materialistic that, quite frankly, it sucks!  And their kids are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spoiled<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brats that no one wants to be around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What does materialism have to do with this conversation?  Do you think<br/>\n&gt; children who are able to intelligently discuss money, materialism, even<br/>\n&gt; WWII will grow up materialistic?  I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t see the<br/>\n&gt; correlation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Living in a group and learning give and take is not going to rob any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of their childhood or happiness.  Learning to share is not a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; detrimental<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stress.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do you think a child won&#39;t learn to share if they are respected?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wouln&#39;t go so far as to say a spoiled brat is in for a miserable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they sure are in for a rude awakening because the rest of the world<br/>\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to cater to their unrealistic expectations of being catered to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Children who are raised finding common preferences will grow up wanting<br/>\n&gt; to find common preferences with others.  This is most certainly not<br/>\n&gt; being catered to.  Also, isn&#39;t spoiled something left to rot?  How does<br/>\n&gt; one get spoiled by unconditional love and respect?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It seems cruel to cater to a child&#39;s every whim and then expect them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to handle real life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is not about catering to a child&#39;s every whim.  It is about<br/>\n&gt; respecting a child&#39;s autonomy.  It is about searching for ways to make<br/>\n&gt; everyone in the family happy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The real world isn&#39;t going to run around finding<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other options for something as simple as &quot;it&#39;s time to go shopping,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shoes on.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What if the child really doesn&#39;t want to go shopping.  If there is<br/>\n&gt; another option, what will the child learn from being forced to go?  I<br/>\n&gt; have noticed that most kids like going on outings, though, so this is<br/>\n&gt; probably a non issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The rest of the world isn&#39;t going to say,&quot;oh, I&#39;m sorry this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I&#39;ll pospone the family&#39;s needs or make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; alternate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arrangements so that I don&#39;t inconvenience your play time.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The rest of the world might like to have a delivered pizza rather than a<br/>\n&gt; home-made meal, though.  The rest of the world might like their<br/>\n&gt; preferences acknowledged as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have met quite a few unschoolers, several of whom are currently<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attending<br/>\n&gt; &gt; college.  All had some basic social boundaries taught and were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; expected to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be contributing members of the family unit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why do you think a child will not want to help in the house if they are<br/>\n&gt; not told to do so?  Might a child like to vacuum and dust?  I know I<br/>\n&gt; love to vacuum and not because my Mom stands behind me telling me it<br/>\n&gt; must be done.  I know lots of kids who like to garden, paint, arrange<br/>\n&gt; shoes, fold clothes, wash windows, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They don&#39;t consider that to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a contributing factor to any childhood unhappiness.  In fact, when I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asked a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; friend&#39;s daughter (she is now 22 and attending Stanford), she looked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; at me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like I had a screw loose, &quot;Yeah, we had one of *those&quot; in my freshman<br/>\n&gt; &gt; class,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he lasted about 3 months and dropped out.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of those what?  Respected kids.  Are you saying that a child who<br/>\n&gt; grows up respected will not be motivated?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Grandmothers in our family, for instance, love to have<br/>\nthe opportunity to come play with a child while parents run errands.<br/>\nSometimes parent prefers to leave a child who doesn&#39;t like errands at<br/>\nhome or with a neighbor who likes trading child care.  In this case, the<br/>\ndecision to go to the store alone is a common preference.  Again, I am<br/>\nnot advocating sacrifice on the behalf of anyone.  The goal is to find a<br/>\npreference for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rather than explaining to the<br/>\n&gt; child that s/he is part of a family/wider community<br/>\n&gt; and that compromise is sometimes necessary in order to<br/>\n&gt; promote the common good and in order to incline others<br/>\n&gt; to occasionally compromise on your behalf *is*<br/>\n&gt; permissive parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am happy for you, if compromise works for you.  I tend to try to find<br/>\na way which allows *everyone* to get what they want.  Lots of creative<br/>\nideas may eliminate the need for sacrifice on any person&#39;s part.  It is<br/>\nnot permissive parenting, if all parties are happy with the outcome.<br/>\nEven the gentle permissive parenting the &quot;studies&quot; refer to, involves<br/>\nparental sacrifice for the good of the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It fits the definition of<br/>\n&gt; permissive parenting provided by the studies, which<br/>\n&gt; may in your case not impose stress on your family, but<br/>\n&gt; which has been shown is studies to frequently result<br/>\n&gt; in stress for the entire family.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And while your example seems reasonable to you, it<br/>\n&gt; seems arbitrary and unfair to me, as it involves<br/>\n&gt; respecting the wishes of one person over the wishes of<br/>\n&gt; others either on the basis of age or on the basis of<br/>\n&gt; their having originated from your body.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once again, the wishes of *everyone* are weighed equally and the goal is<br/>\nto find a preference which each person finds genuinely appealing and<br/>\npreferable.  The child is not given any more or less respect than the<br/>\nadults.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; According to the descriptions in the studies, all<br/>\n&gt; three parenting styles *can* take children very<br/>\n&gt; seriously indeed, and taking children and their needs<br/>\n&gt; seriously is inherent in the Authoritative approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I still claim that imposing artificial boundaries is not taking children<br/>\nseriously.

You<br/>\n&gt; were the one who said you would be interested to read<br/>\n&gt; the studies, I provided some sources.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I want a study that says children need parents to impose stress.  The<br/>\nauthors to which you refer talk about parenting styles.  None, that I am<br/>\naware of, say, &quot;Jane needs a parent to give her stress in order to<br/>\nhandle the world effectively.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes preferences are *not* common, and then one<br/>\n&gt; must either give to one side, the other, or<br/>\n&gt; compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I assert there is always a way to find a common preference.

I try to make sure that<br/>\nI am happy with the outcomes of our decisions.  I try to make sure I am<br/>\nnot self-sacrificing (which I believe begets resentment, but that is<br/>\nanother post).  I don&#39;t believe I have ever inconvenienced another<br/>\nperson in this approach to parenting.  We may have to sit and think<br/>\ncreatively for some time before a common preference is reached, but when<br/>\nwe really try, we have always succeeded.  I am not saying that I am<br/>\nperfect.  I have imposed my will before.  I have, in that circumstance,<br/>\nsaid I was sorry and began brainstorming better solutions for future<br/>\nsimilar circumstances.  I am still learning.

Can you explain what stress you get naturally without having an arbitrary boundary adding to it?  Can you see how the world offers a fair amount of stress","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1232329712\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Can you explain what stress they are getting naturally if you are<br/>\n&gt; removing<br/>\n&gt; all boundaries<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you explain what stress you get naturally without having an<br/>\narbitrary boundary adding to it?  Can you see how the world offers a<br/>\nfair amount of stress naturally?  Why the need for artificial<br/>\nboundaries?  Would you like it if your husband, say, thought you needed<br/>\njust a little more stress because, well, you hadn&#39;t learned it well<br/>\nenough when you were a child?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and believe that simple lessons in living in the real world<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be taught?  What, &quot;he took my toy&quot; or &quot;waaaa, my Barbie<br/>\n&gt; broke?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that simple lessons are not learned.  Sometimes a broken<br/>\ntoy is lesson enough... I don&#39;t need to teach that.  What, exactly, is<br/>\nyour question?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As to being sent to bed when a parent determined the time, there are<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; than one type of doing this.  The arbitrary, &quot;it is 9 p.m., you will<br/>\n&gt; go to<br/>\n&gt; bed&quot; and the parent who is aware of a child who gets beyond the point<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; knowing their are tired and keeps going like they are in a race with<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; Energizer bunny.  I have one of those and I send her to bed.  The<br/>\n&gt; minute her<br/>\n&gt; head hits the pillow she is out.  If you don&#39;t send her to bed, she<br/>\n&gt; gets<br/>\n&gt; physically ill.  I&#39;m thinking the &quot;stress&quot; of being sent to bed is<br/>\n&gt; better<br/>\n&gt; for her than the &quot;stress&quot; of vomiting and spending a day in bed with a<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; fever.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why does one make themselves sick when they are tired?  Certainly this<br/>\nis not typical behavior.  I actually know a two year old who has had a<br/>\ncomplete absence of coercion regarding bedtime.  She will say she is<br/>\ntired at 7:30 or 10:30, when she is tired.  She walks herself to bed and<br/>\nmay or may not ask for an adult to accompany her.  Certainly a person<br/>\nwill be able to determine how tired they feel.  A brand new infant<br/>\nsleeps when he or she is tired, no one had to teach this baby how to<br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, children do not &quot;naturally&quot; use phrases such as &quot;please&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;thank<br/>\n&gt; you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you sure?  A child mimics behavior of adults naturally.  That is how<br/>\nthey learn to talk, walk, eat, etc.  I know children who say please and<br/>\nthank you naturally.  They also like to discuss manners and occasionally<br/>\nexperiment with exceedingly good manners to see people smile, act<br/>\nimpressed, or give them a compliment.  Children, I believe, are born<br/>\ninherently good, they like to see people smile, feel proud of<br/>\nthemselves, have friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Quite frankly, without any of the very minimal boundaries talked<br/>\n&gt; about, I&#39;m not thinking the child is going to grow up to be a very<br/>\n&gt; &quot;nice&quot;<br/>\n&gt; person.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Frankly, children with truths behind them seem nicer than very coerced<br/>\nand controlled children who may be bullies in the absence of adults.<br/>\nThese children are able to talk intelligently about being nice or being<br/>\nmean.  But, really, the point is not whether or not they are nice, but<br/>\nrather if they are respected as individuals and complete beings.<br/>\nChildren who see respect, learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Part of the problem, IMHO, with the world today is that society is too<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; narcistic.  Parents who lived through WWII went out of their way to<br/>\n&gt; give,<br/>\n&gt; give, give to their kids and now we seeing a whole load of folks that<br/>\n&gt; are so<br/>\n&gt; materialistic that, quite frankly, it sucks!  And their kids are<br/>\n&gt; spoiled<br/>\n&gt; brats that no one wants to be around.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What does materialism have to do with this conversation?  Do you think<br/>\nchildren who are able to intelligently discuss money, materialism, even<br/>\nWWII will grow up materialistic?  I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t see the<br/>\ncorrelation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Living in a group and learning give and take is not going to rob any<br/>\n&gt; child<br/>\n&gt; of their childhood or happiness.  Learning to share is not a<br/>\n&gt; detrimental<br/>\n&gt; stress.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you think a child won&#39;t learn to share if they are respected?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wouln&#39;t go so far as to say a spoiled brat is in for a miserable<br/>\n&gt; life, but<br/>\n&gt; they sure are in for a rude awakening because the rest of the world<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; going to cater to their unrealistic expectations of being catered to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Children who are raised finding common preferences will grow up wanting<br/>\nto find common preferences with others.  This is most certainly not<br/>\nbeing catered to.  Also, isn&#39;t spoiled something left to rot?  How does<br/>\none get spoiled by unconditional love and respect?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems cruel to cater to a child&#39;s every whim and then expect them<br/>\n&gt; to be<br/>\n&gt; able to handle real life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is not about catering to a child&#39;s every whim.  It is about<br/>\nrespecting a child&#39;s autonomy.  It is about searching for ways to make<br/>\neveryone in the family happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The real world isn&#39;t going to run around finding<br/>\n&gt; other options for something as simple as &quot;it&#39;s time to go shopping,<br/>\n&gt; get your<br/>\n&gt; shoes on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if the child really doesn&#39;t want to go shopping.  If there is<br/>\nanother option, what will the child learn from being forced to go?  I<br/>\nhave noticed that most kids like going on outings, though, so this is<br/>\nprobably a non issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The rest of the world isn&#39;t going to say,&quot;oh, I&#39;m sorry this<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I&#39;ll pospone the family&#39;s needs or make<br/>\n&gt; alternate<br/>\n&gt; arrangements so that I don&#39;t inconvenience your play time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The rest of the world might like to have a delivered pizza rather than a<br/>\nhome-made meal, though.  The rest of the world might like their<br/>\npreferences acknowledged as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have met quite a few unschoolers, several of whom are currently<br/>\n&gt; attending<br/>\n&gt; college.  All had some basic social boundaries taught and were<br/>\n&gt; expected to<br/>\n&gt; be contributing members of the family unit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you think a child will not want to help in the house if they are<br/>\nnot told to do so?  Might a child like to vacuum and dust?  I know I<br/>\nlove to vacuum and not because my Mom stands behind me telling me it<br/>\nmust be done.  I know lots of kids who like to garden, paint, arrange<br/>\nshoes, fold clothes, wash windows, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They don&#39;t consider that to be<br/>\n&gt; a contributing factor to any childhood unhappiness.  In fact, when I<br/>\n&gt; asked a<br/>\n&gt; friend&#39;s daughter (she is now 22 and attending Stanford), she looked<br/>\n&gt; at me<br/>\n&gt; like I had a screw loose, &quot;Yeah, we had one of *those&quot; in my freshman<br/>\n&gt; class,<br/>\n&gt; he lasted about 3 months and dropped out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of those what?  Respected kids.  Are you saying that a child who<br/>\ngrows up respected will not be motivated?<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tammy Graves","from":"&quot;Tammy Graves&quot; &lt;tgraves@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UQqfD-RzLvv4dJtWk2mmVmmmJq42WTLPY9oiozNtYayYeJW7nbJcLIO9bUtGZ5ZYVAsbPA5vD114lwdvg2mgHoObaf8afd6oUFdy8Y4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Brain atrophy","postDate":"990040310","msgId":21327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1MjU2QTRFLjAwNkEwRDU3LjAwQG5vdGVzLmJhLmhjaWEuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21326,"nextInTopic":21329,"prevInTime":21326,"nextInTime":21328,"topicId":21321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"ok, lets call it a truse already.

Sarah makes a<br/>\n&gt; huge, and IMO unwarranted, leap from &#39;reasonable<br/>\n&gt; boundaries&#39; and &#39;natural stressors&#39; to &#39;inflicting<br/>\n&gt; hurt&#39; and having boundaries &#39;arbitrarily crammed down<br/>\n&gt; their throats&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No one needs to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have stress imposed on them, particularly by a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trusted advisor, namely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Eileen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes, they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me again:<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I made an unwarranted, leap from &#39;reasonable<br/>\nboundaries&#39; and &#39;natural stressors&#39; to &#39;inflicting<br/>\nhurt&#39;.  I took the above statement to mean you were purposely imposing<br/>\nstress on your child.  I think purposely imposing stress is inflicting<br/>\nhurt.  I am truly sorry if I misunderstood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She equates having boundaries to<br/>\n&gt; having a miserable childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I equate artificial, imposed, and arbitrary boundaries to an<br/>\nunhappy child in a given moment.  Continued use of these artificial<br/>\nboundaries probably could lead to a miserable childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But studies *also* show that permissive parenting<br/>\n&gt; often leads to immaturity, lack of impulse control,<br/>\n&gt; lack of independence and self reliance, lack of social<br/>\n&gt; responsibility; correlational studies establish a<br/>\n&gt; relationship between permissive parenting styles and<br/>\n&gt; procrastination, lowered achievement motivation, goal<br/>\n&gt; avoidance, lowered self esteem, dysfunctional/avoidant<br/>\n&gt; coping skills, as well as a dysfunctional ability to<br/>\n&gt; assess the reasons for low achievement and frustration<br/>\n&gt; (external assessment, leading to goal avoidance and<br/>\n&gt; feelings of helplessness and anger).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have also read about permissive parenting, and that is not what I am<br/>\ntalking about.  I am talking about alleviating as much stress as<br/>\npossible from the lives of everyone in my family, not imposing it.  I am<br/>\nalso talking about respecting the wishes of the children in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe approach is not one of do nothing (permissive) or of control<br/>\n(authoritarian).  The idea of taking children seriously does not fit any<br/>\nof the three approaches (permissive, authoritative, authoritarian).<br/>\nTaking children seriously is not self-sacrifice or narcissism.  Common<br/>\npreferences are about helping the entire family, in their individual<br/>\nendeavors, find happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a permissive parent, I am a parent involved moment by moment in<br/>\na child&#39;s life.

I am saying that no one needs stress imposed on them . . .<br/>\nlife, unfortunately, does this just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, sharing one&#39;s best theories with a child, and being completely<br/>\nhonest with them, allows the child to use his or her own mind to come to<br/>\nconclusions about his or her own life and body.  This actually gives the<br/>\nchild a better foundation for facing the real world.  The child has been<br/>\nmaking decisions all along, and therefore, the real world is less scary<br/>\nand stressful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am saying that there are possible win-win situations for all involved<br/>\nin every situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the teeth example.   I would definitely offer one&#39;s best theories<br/>\nto their child regarding tooth brushing.  If they were interested, I<br/>\nwould buy a tooth paste they might like, show them how to brush in front<br/>\nof their favorite TV show, tell them the possible consequences of<br/>\nimproper brushing, offer chewing gum, tell them about the benefits of<br/>\neating lots of carrots, take them to talk with a dentist.  I am saying<br/>\nto give all the information that you have available to your children.  I<br/>\nhave noticed that the lack of coercion allows children to make informed<br/>\ndecisions.  These children are not rebelling.  They are not having to<br/>\ndecipher between facts and lies.  The children I know who have<br/>\ninformation backing them make very logical decisions.  They also like to<br/>\nbe around adults that are their friends.  They like too brush side by<br/>\nside, or take baths together, or say please and thank you because the<br/>\nadults in their life model good behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am advocating giving children some credit, letting them use their<br/>\nminds, trusting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching an interested party is not setting boundaries, imo.  Take the<br/>\ncar.  A child who is learning to drive will probably be eager to learn,<br/>\nkeep themselves and the family car safe.  A hypothetical teen in the US<br/>\nprobably has a pretty good idea what accepted road rules are. If this<br/>\nsame teen, for some reason, doesn&#39;t like, say, going slow, a parent<br/>\nmight show the teen a wide, open, empty space where the two can practice<br/>\ngoing fast in a safe manner.  They might also practice going slow, or<br/>\nnot signaling.  If this child really likes speed, the parent might help<br/>\nthem go sky diving or take racing lessons, or, well, the list is<br/>\nendless.  The point is the teen can learn safety and also satisfy other<br/>\ndesires.  The parent and child would probably talk a lot about cause and<br/>\neffect.  The teen would set their own boundaries because they have<br/>\nlearned to trust their own judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not advocating laissez faire parenting.
