Do not go into \ndepth or anything else. I didn&#39;t when I pulled Naomi out 9 weeks ago. I just \ninformed them verbally that I was homeschooling my daughter and pulling her out \non so and so date and that was it. I also informed the school district and there \nwere no problems. Fortunatly I live in a state where no testing is required and \nthe teaching totally is up to the parents. No logs, No workbooks to prove \nanything.
