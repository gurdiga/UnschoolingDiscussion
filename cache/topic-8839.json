Today, for\u000f<br/>\n&gt;  instance, we went bowling. What most people would think of as play we<br/>\nturned\u000f<br/>\n&gt;  into a lesson. Math with scorekeeping, science with physics of the ball\u000f<br/>\n&gt;  going down the alley, etc. Even a trip to the grocery store can be\u000f<br/>\n&gt;  educational.

I&#39;ve found it&#39;s best for us to answer her questions,<br/>\nand try to make time for conversations, and she&#39;ll figure out what she needs<br/>\nto know in her own way. btw, this includes maths &lt;g&gt; But she does have<br/>\n&gt; a certain amount of &#39;puter stuff, though no drawing tools or paper atm,<br/>\ncos they got thrown out in a tidying-up dispute on Tuesday.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Tracy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8838,"nextTopicId":8841}}
