We eventually bought a different, smaller set and<br/>\ncame home to check the internet.  Oh.  It&#39;ll be released on May 29, and it<br/>\ncosts $100.  So now he&#39;s wanting it for his birthday this summer!  That&#39;s a<br/>\nlittle out of his range.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the several hours of driving around looking for this set, we had<br/>\ngreat conversations about Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn.  Tim brought a book<br/>\nhome from the library on Marco Polo a couple weeks ago, and we read it<br/>\ntogether.  It&#39;s been chaotic here lately, so I never really asked why he was<br/>\ninterested in Marco Polo.  (Tim goes to the library at the military school<br/>\nonce a week; I don&#39;t go, so I often miss his reasoning in wanting a<br/>\nparticular book.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out Marco Polo&#39;s adventures are the whole point of this most recent<br/>\nlego series called Orient Adventures.  He&#39;s been reading all about them in<br/>\nlego magazine, wanted more information, and found it.  Now he wanted the<br/>\nlegos so he could really play the stuff that comes out of the books.  He<br/>\nalso announced he needed a bigger lego space, which involved room<br/>\nrearranging, and he cleaned up his room to facilitate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like shouting from the rooftops that unschooling really works! to<br/>\neverybody who&#39;s ever told me it won&#39;t work, he&#39;ll never learn to follow<br/>\nthrough on things, do research, etc.  But so many people would never see<br/>\nthis, because it looks just like play.  It&#39;s &quot;just legos&quot;.  Wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy, calm, relaxed week.<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69331,"nextTopicId":69275}}
