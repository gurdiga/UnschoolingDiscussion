Since this <br/>\ntime my 5yos has started to display poor loosing manners. If it looks <br/>\nlike he is loosing the game or will loose the game he will have a <br/>\nfit, throw his cards down and sit and pout. I finally told him that <br/>\nthe behavior was not appropriate and that everyone wins sometimes and <br/>\neveryone looses sometimes. Tonight I ended up sending him to bed <br/>\nearly because he would not sit still during the game of Memory we <br/>\nwere playing and he kept messing up the cards we had laid on the <br/>\nfloor. Finally, after telling him repeatedly that he needed to sit <br/>\nstill and quit jumping around I made him sit out of the game. He sat <br/>\non the opposate side of the room while DD and I finished the game. At <br/>\nthe start of the next game I told him that if he would sit still then <br/>\nhe could come and join the game with us which he decided not to. And <br/>\nthat was fine except that he kept complaining that he wanted to play <br/>\nthe game but &quot;Mommy won&#39;t let me.&quot; I repeated that he could play with <br/>\nus, and that we wanted him to play with us, and that he would have to <br/>\nsit still and that all his jumping around was messing up the cards.<br/>\nAnyway, after his repeated complaining I finally sent him to bed. I <br/>\nknow a lot of his problem was that he was tired. I guess what I want <br/>\nto know is this type of behavior normal for a 5yob. This is not the <br/>\nfirst time he has had a fit over loosing a game and lately he seems <br/>\nto be doing things that he knows he is not supposed to and then gets <br/>\nangery with me when I disapline him. It has been going on for about a <br/>\nmonth now and I&#39;m really getting tired of it. I just don&#39;t know if it <br/>\nis a phase he is going through or if I should be wondering if <br/>\nsomething else is on his mind. Any suggestion?
