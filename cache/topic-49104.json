The just try talking about what you do with <br/>\nyour child and how he learns. Small steps and don&#39;t get upset about it but <br/>\nbe convicted and concerned enough so he sees you do care and watch closely <br/>\nwhat and how he learns. Even if you don&#39;t do school at home, I would make it <br/>\nsound more like you do for the moment. At least until he gets more receptive <br/>\nto the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would also help if you found out a little about the court system there <br/>\nand how receptive they are to it. See if you can find out about judges <br/>\nthere. Word of mouth works great for this. You can get a good idea of what <br/>\nwould happen if you had to go to court for this if your ex decided on it. <br/>\nThen you can keep and put together records to have in case that happens. I <br/>\nwould say make stuff up if you have to.

In kindergarten they<br/>\nare working on letter recognition/basic one to one correspondence/ small and<br/>\nlarge motor control. Maybe just learning some &quot;educationese&quot; you can talk<br/>\nabout with your ex when he asks will calm his fears. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;I am going to be part of a NAPS in our area.

What all the charter schools here seem to do is<br/>\nmutter about following the Core Knowledge Series. You might want to take a<br/>\nlook at the Kindergarten and the First Grade volumes just to get an idea of<br/>\nwhat that means. You can even show the books to your ex. ;) That doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nyou have to follow them, just that you will be educating yourself on what<br/>\nother people say when they say that *they* are following them. It might give<br/>\nyou a bit of peace of mind to know how some people feel comfortable with a<br/>\nguideline like that, while you are able to find resources and support your own<br/>\nchild&#39;s learning without that crutch. Another thing you can do is if they<br/>\nprint out a list of books you&#39;ve borrowed from the library, you might keep the<br/>\nlists to show your ex or just remind yourself all the subjects you&#39;ve<br/>\nexplored.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;I just wondered if any of you had any tips as to how I can argue my <br/>\n&gt;case with my ex.

Try to really listen to your ex&#39;s concerns and make a<br/>\nreal effort to hear the words and not react to them, at least to him in<br/>\nperson, with strong emotion. This can be difficult with ex&#39;s but as some folks<br/>\naround here have said at times, using a mental picture, maybe of your ex as he<br/>\nwas as a child, instead of as a demanding adult, might help. Find out the<br/>\nareas that he is concerned about and make an effort to calm *his* fears. He<br/>\ndoes have a right to be concerned about his son&#39;s education. I don&#39;t think it<br/>\nis dishonest not to actively bring in the concept of &quot;un&quot; schooling at this<br/>\npoint, not with a five year old. Who knows where you will be next year or the<br/>\nyear after that? Right now just work on today and keep the topic current<br/>\nrather than inviting argument. Think of this time as the time you and your ex<br/>\nwill be building a base of communication for the coming years as partners in<br/>\nraising your son. Even if the raising has been a bit one sided, the better the<br/>\ncommunication between you two, the better it will be for your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Ex may be against homeschooling","postDate":"1036272379","msgId":49107,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlLjIwMTQ2NmU0LjJhZjU5Y2ZiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49104,"nextInTopic":49108,"prevInTime":49106,"nextInTime":49108,"topicId":49104,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/2/02 2:14:44 PM, TroyBridgetM@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-941188617\">In a message dated 11/2/02 2:14:44 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TroyBridgetM@...\">TroyBridgetM@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I just wondered if any of you had any tips as to how I can argue my <br/>\ncase with my ex.
