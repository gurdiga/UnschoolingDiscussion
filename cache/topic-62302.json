How to balance the time with my children . I don&#39;t seem to be able <br/>\nto this very well.My son is 7 years, daughter is 18mos. She does not sleep <br/>\nwith any great regularity. I try to read to ds and she is all over us like a <br/>\nbad smell. I have tried setting her with stuff to do, but she is still so <br/>\nlittle and has such a short attention span. We hardly read at all right <br/>\nnow!!!! If we try to do any art or lego or puzzles or anything she  wrecks <br/>\nit. I am trying to take the approach that this too will pass, but I am <br/>\ngetting frustrated today!! I feel as if I am neglecting my son. My husband is <br/>\nnot overly involved with  the kids when he is home, unless I set him a <br/>\nspecific task, which I hate doing.Even if he tries, dd is very single-minded <br/>\nand hard to distract when she wants to be involved with what we are doing. I <br/>\ntry to involve her, but I realize that this is developmental. Anyone else <br/>\nexperience this? Any suggestions?<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n(I&#39;&#39;ll drop the in BC part as I seem to be the only Nancy for now)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62367,"nextTopicId":62343}}
