I try to make sure I truly understand the long term consequences <br/>\nmyself before I discuss them with my child.

What would be the point? Any orthodontist <br/>\nwill tell you that without patient cooperation and motivation the treatment <br/>\nwill have questionable results and is likely to revert afterwards. I know <br/>\nplenty of kids who didn&#39;t want braces, didn&#39;t use their bands consistently, <br/>\nignored brushing instructions and so had decay problems, and managed to lose <br/>\ntheir retainers as soon as possible after getting them. Seems like a huge <br/>\nwaste of time, money, and energy to me. On the other hand kids who choose <br/>\nbraces seem to cooperate with the treatment and end up happy with their <br/>\nresults.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128307542,"authorName":"Earthmomma67@aol.com","from":"Earthmomma67@...","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Trust was Braces, scholarships and stuff","postDate":"1042759554","msgId":55357,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGExLjMyOTUxZDBlLjJiNTg5OTgyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55381,"prevInTime":55356,"nextInTime":55358,"topicId":55357,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/16/03 6:13:19 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

When you allow the small choices in life  when they are younger, they <br/>\nwill have the opportunity to *experience* the consequences of their <br/>\ndecisions, good or bad. They don&#39;t just have to take our &quot;wiser adult&quot; word <br/>\nfor it. They don&#39;t have to be punished to &quot;teach&quot; consequences. They LEARN <br/>\nthem.<br/>\nAllow them the choices. TRUST in your children.<br/>\nDon&#39;t just throw &quot;Well, What if this should happen&quot;&#39;s at us because we can <br/>\ndiscuss What If&#39;s forever and never touch a fractions of all the variables.<br/>\nLook at your children TODAY. Look at all the wonderful decisions they are <br/>\nmaking, some because of your input, some in spite of it. Look at their <br/>\nability to learn. Not just academics, but people skills, personal boundaries, <br/>\nbody consciousness. All by making choices, big and small.<br/>\nTrust them. If you love and respect and trust them, they will have all you <br/>\nwant for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*Elissa Jill*~*<br/>\nunschooling Momma to 3 beautiful brilliant people<br/>\nLoving partner for life to Joey<br/>\nterrible guitarist, fair singer and happy woman.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54834,"nextTopicId":55286}}
