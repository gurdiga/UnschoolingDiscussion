Anytime you physically touch someone without <br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be constituted as abuse.

I do not need the permission of my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;children to administer correction.  Do you seriously ask permission from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your children before you correct them?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;And no, I do not think anytime someone touches another without permission<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is abuse.  I have been bumped into, had my feet stepped on, and hugged<br/>\n&gt; &gt;without my permission, and would in no way consider those abuse.  People<br/>\n&gt; &gt;accidentally bump into, step on, and even knock others over on a regular<br/>\n&gt; &gt;basis.  It doesn&#39;t mean they are abusers.

I am not here to agree or disagree with anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am here to say that even though I have been quite tolerant and patient of<br/>\nthese emails filling my inbox these last few days, it&#39;s a bit tiring seeing<br/>\nsome really judgmental and quite rude statements. Everybody does things<br/>\ndifferently, and what works for some doesn&#39;t work for all. I can understand<br/>\nsoapboxes, and how people feel very passionately about certain things. But<br/>\nall of the rudeness has gotten to the point that it&#39;s embarrassing to think<br/>\nthat anyone would visit this list to subscribe and see so much harshness and<br/>\ndownright meanness. It&#39;s one thing to make room for other&#39;s views and also<br/>\nto disagree with them. It&#39;s another to be so intolerant and rude. I&#39;m weary<br/>\nof all of this, and yes Dia, I have given you some attention that you seem<br/>\nto be needy of by directing this email toward you, as it&#39;s mainly your<br/>\ndefensive, aggressive, condescension that I am addressing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m sure this email won&#39;t make a bit of difference to some, but there<br/>\nare so many other topics that we can introduce rather then allowing some of<br/>\nthis rudeness to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nDia, could you possibly reply to someone&#39;s email without dissecting it and<br/>\nflaming them? (and if you want to copy and paste this into an email with<br/>\nexcerpts from other emails that you have replied to without flaming someone,<br/>\nfeel free).<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch love to all,<br/>\n<br/>\nBrynn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Dia Garland [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moocow@...\">moocow@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 28, 2000 8:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] abuse<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;.
