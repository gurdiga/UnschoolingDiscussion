I wasn&#39;t making a statement about <br/>\nall teachers, I was talking about this one based on the information we were <br/>\ngiven about the statement she made regarding one child that, by the way, she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say I know LOTS of teachers.  I know LOTS of former teachers.  My <br/>\ndear mother in law is a teacher.  I love her to death.  I also hear her <br/>\ncomplain bitterly about the system, and she works in one of the best schools <br/>\nin one of the best school districts in the state.  She is counting the days <br/>\nuntil retirement.  And, she&#39;s a wonderful teacher!  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has also been supportive of our decision to homeschool.  On the other <br/>\nhand, she thinks that there is no way to educate a child at home other than <br/>\nto do school-at-home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can also say that I had some wonderful teachers in my 23 years of formal <br/>\nschooling.  I also have friends who are former teachers.  In fact, none of <br/>\nthese teachers plans to go back to teaching.  They left because they were <br/>\nsick of it, or they left to raise their children and decided that was more <br/>\nfun or more important than going back into teaching school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I will make one more blanket statement.  It also used to bother me <br/>\nwhen people dissed the school system, because that&#39;s not what led my family <br/>\nto homeschool.  I saw nothing fundamentally wrong with &quot;the system&quot;.  Now, <br/>\nhowever, after talking with so many people who taught in schools, after <br/>\ntalking with so many people who had children in schools (as I did), after <br/>\nreading so many books on the subject (for and against schools), and after <br/>\nmuch contemplation, I am of the opinion that school, as we know it today, <br/>\nshould be abolished, together with its boards of education, its multi-level <br/>\nadministration, its standardized testing, and its teachers.  That&#39;s public <br/>\nschools, private schools, charter schools, you name it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that children should be taught at home by parents or in very small <br/>\ngroups.  (I might consider retaining the one-room schoolhouse.)  School is <br/>\nthe worst way to provide for a child&#39;s -- any child&#39;s --  education.  And <br/>\nbecause I am sure to get flamed, I might as well say that of course some <br/>\npeople, single parents, those few families in which both parents must work, <br/>\nor for those few families that just don&#39;t have the temperment, must make <br/>\nprovision for their children.  Personally, I would much rather see those <br/>\nchildren in the arms of a nice cooperating homeschooling family during the <br/>\nday than warehoused in a school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"aworthen","from":"&quot;aworthen&quot; &lt;aworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"AxFjSWclOSWAKd71V_IgiGpSV7_G-XIY_zW0kP6f-r5UVJRPOaT9-Br5IHQqOC7fo3856Ik2FL1eMSD6-mizxuUaMleeVGxVxA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] i am so angry","postDate":"968100182","msgId":12639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWMwMTZiMCRiODZlZDNlMCRkM2E0ODAxOEBuZS5tZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwOGEwMWMwMTZhZSRkNDgyM2VjMCQ5YzI5NTQzZkBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":12638,"nextInTopic":12905,"prevInTime":12638,"nextInTime":12640,"topicId":12455,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
