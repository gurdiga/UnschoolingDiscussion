This sounds like it was a very <br/>\n&gt;  difficult time, as is usually the case, however, the only symptom he <br/>\n&gt;  had was the drooling and a cold/runny nose the weekend prior to the <br/>\n&gt;  teeth cutting in. Corallyn<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both of my children had a similar schedule...except that they cut their first <br/>\nteeth at 3 months.  Imagine my surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS #2 lost his first baby tooth when he &#39;bit&#39; 2 legos apart.  I didn&#39;t even <br/>\nknow he had a loose tooth and rushed him to the dentist, complete with <br/>\nputting the tooth in milk to preserve it so it could be re-implanted!  The <br/>\ndentist was very kind about it when he assured me the tooth was simply loose <br/>\nand had fallen out just like it was supposed to.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also explained that when the milk teeth are getting ready to come out, the <br/>\nnew tooth absorbs the root of the baby tooth, so there really is nothing for <br/>\nthe tooth to hang on to when it&#39;s time for the new tooth to come in.  That&#39;s <br/>\nwhy they get wiggly.  So, if you want to verify whether it is decay or simple <br/>\ngrowth, look at the tooth.  If there is a distinct ring around it at the gum <br/>\nline and there is still root, decay would be an issue.  If (as I suspect) <br/>\nthere is pretty much no root, but only a jagged bottom with a normal looking <br/>\ntooth on top, the tooth was simply ready to come out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother clue would be which tooth came out.  If it is a front tooth, top or <br/>\nbottom, I&#39;d place my bets on natural growth.  These teeth do not have decay <br/>\nas readily as the back teeth and they are the first to grow in/fall out in <br/>\nthe normal teething pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real give away will be if a matching tooth gets loose or comes out <br/>\nsoon...I&#39;ll bet it does.  Besides, even if it is decay...good brushing habits <br/>\nnow will protect the adult teeth and it hasn&#39;t hurt him any at all to have <br/>\nthis one lost at age 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12445,"nextTopicId":12451}}
