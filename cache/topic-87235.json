Mostly they ran around naked or partially clothed and we did ask them if they need to go when we went they learned naturally.  Stopped using diapers at night when they said they were ready.  Mostly used cloth diapers, disposies sometimes when we we&#39;re going out, I was feeling lazy or was booked solid for a few days(maybe the same thing?).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to say in response to the quote above...<br/>\nWhen we are out or have a lot of company over My kids benefited from wearing pull-ups.  First from not having to go through cleaning up and changing when &#39;they&#39; had much more exciting things to do.  Secondly they have experienced no bad reactions from less sensitive people as they cleaned up after an accident.  (I&#39;m sure my Aunt would pass out if my almost three yearold had peed on her 200 yearold sofa, tee hee, luckily she had a pullup on) <br/>\n<br/>\nNow those might sound like they make life easier on the grownups and yup they do.  It&#39;s much easier to have a Wee&#39;un come to me and say &quot;Need new Inup&quot; during x-mas dinner at Aunties.  Then have to clean up and change them.  But it benefits the Kids too cause they don&#39;t have to stand there cold and wet getting cleaned up.  I also don&#39;t like having to keep many changes of clothes in a sack to truck around every where.  Also I live in Canada and It&#39;s bloody cold in my area today -20C(I&#39;m so glad I don&#39;t have to walk kids to school at 8 in the dark and be dressed and brushed with four kids bundled up. ug)  Although I don&#39;t like disposables due to environmental concerns, and the smell of linen fresh off the line in summer, I do use pull-ups.  Also My 6yo isn&#39;t reliably dry at night and so she has access to them as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I&#39;ve blathered on long enough.<br/>\nTeresa in Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159022987,"authorName":"Olga","from":"&quot;Olga&quot; &lt;mccluskieo@...&gt;","profile":"britcontoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: pullups","postDate":"1073051855","msgId":87435,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ0M3RjZit0dXE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4Ljc4OTFmMS4yZDI0NGU0YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":87357,"nextInTopic":87490,"prevInTime":87434,"nextInTime":87436,"topicId":87235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I--- In UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com, rubyprincesstsg@a... ... pullups, do so ... are others who ... them. ...

My son runs around naked at home <br/>\nall day.  When he goes to bed he wears a pull-up which is the same <br/>\nas a diaper for him.  Why should his rest be disturbed and sheets <br/>\nchanges, etc?  He is not ready to go all night without having an <br/>\naccident.  Also, when we go out he wears one.  He is not ready to be <br/>\nout and about bare.  When we go to the park, I would rather he go as <br/>\nhe need than stop his play, dry him, change his clothes, who knows <br/>\nhow many times which would just frustrates him and takes away from <br/>\nhis play time.

The washable<br/>\nones have a nicer cottony surface and were less sweat inducing than the<br/>\nplastic ones. They were pretty large and the idea was to protect our super<br/>\nexpensive bed, rather than as a laundry reducer. I still put it under our<br/>\nfitted sheet, unless Jayn was napping on sofa or on top of the bed - then I<br/>\nwould put one under her just in case. I think a boy (or a girl for that<br/>\nmatter) would have to pour out a gallon to soak over the whole pad, but he<br/>\nwould pretty much soak his pj&#39;s, and his top sheet at any rate.
