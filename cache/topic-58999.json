If the<br/>\nparent is too busy to read to the kids much, to take them to the library, to<br/>\nsit and play games with them, to seek out books they think the kid might<br/>\nlike, to take time to answer their questions or find answers to their<br/>\nquestions, etc. are they better off with a curriculum?<br/>\n <br/>\nDo you feel the forced curriculum would do more harm than the kid being left<br/>\nto his own devices?<br/>\n <br/>\nI have thought this through some and I can&#39;t really decided which would be<br/>\nbetter in those circumstances.  In my mind, I try to put myself in other<br/>\npeople&#39;s shoes to figure out what I would do under those circumstances, but<br/>\nI am not sure.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI can see the one pro for leaving them to their own devices would be not<br/>\nkilling their love of learning but on the other hand, at least with a<br/>\ncurriculum they get some one on one with their parent that they might not<br/>\nget otherwise.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAngela in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Maine-unschooling@...\">Maine-unschooling@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/\">http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.&quot;<br/>\nEmerson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to meet a child for whom unschooling would not work.<br/>\nI have met many families and parents who I think are incapable (or, maybe<br/>\nmore accurately, just unwilling) to assist their children in successful<br/>\nunschooling, but I think &quot;learning through true interest and/or need&quot; is a<br/>\ngood definition of &quot;human&quot;.
