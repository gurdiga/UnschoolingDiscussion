This is probably because I have worked very hard to overcome a difficult childhood and not be a victim myself.  My siblings,all three,on the other hand, have never overcome their difficulties.  My parents are both dead. When my siblings and I get together at holidays, we often talk about our childhood.  As I see how their lives have been affected, I have become more angry at my parents for their ignorance. My siblings on the other hand can&#39;t understand this.  They say they forgive my parents because they say they didn&#39;t know any better and they themselves never want to be judged for the flaws they have as parents.  Unfortunately, their children are already suffering. I remember when I was dealing with my own problems and I found out what was causing them, I got very angry and it was that anger that gave me the energy to move forward. I want to be a good parent.  It is very important to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie and all others on this list, I am not thin skinned and appreciate your unedited thoughts and opinions.  That is why I ask.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5493754,"authorName":"lite2yu@aol.com","from":"lite2yu@...","profile":"lite2yu2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] shaping our values","postDate":"1011536117","msgId":31131,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NC4yNjRkNTg0LjI5N2MyYWY1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31127,"nextInTopic":31159,"prevInTime":31130,"nextInTime":31132,"topicId":31127,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I honor and respect what you have said here Leslie living in abundance lovemary There are no victims in this world. . . only opportunities [Non-text portions","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1729334427\">I honor and respect what you have said here Leslie<br/>\n<br/>\nliving in abundance<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no victims in this world. . . only opportunities<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66627689,"authorName":"Leslie Moyer","from":"&quot;Leslie Moyer&quot; &lt;LeslieMoyer@...&gt;","profile":"philabaloni","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"shaping our values","postDate":"1011508304","msgId":31127,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBHRUZKT0JOTklDRUJKSEpLUEtQQUVOR0NKQUEuTGVzbGllTW95ZXJAZ2VvdGVjLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31131,"prevInTime":31126,"nextInTime":31128,"topicId":31127,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In writing that last post, I was thinking about all the different things in our lives that influence how we think/feel about things, our values and priorities.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1615320216\">In writing that last post, I was thinking about all the different things in<br/>\nour lives that influence how we think/feel about things, our values and<br/>\npriorities.

She really relishes<br/>\nthe &quot;victim&quot; role and feels like life has been so unfair to her.  I do<br/>\nbelieve that some of her choices are crippled because of her mental illness,<br/>\nbut also see so many times when she did have rational, clear-thinking<br/>\nchoices and she chose the victim route intentionally.  She has caused our<br/>\nfamily a lot of heartache because of it.  That&#39;s why &quot;empowered choices&quot; are<br/>\na particularly touchy subject for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAn old friend of mine made very different parenting choices from me, but I<br/>\ncould look at her life and see *why* she made those kinds of choices.  Her<br/>\nown childhood was very unstable and she valued &quot;independence&quot; very strongly<br/>\nas she had learned as a child that she couldn&#39;t count on anyone.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\njudge her for these choices--or even think any less of her at all for them.<br/>\nI whole-heartedly understood why she was compelled to make these choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway.....regarding all of the educational and parenting choices dialogue,<br/>\nand knowing how much Pat is wrestling with some of these ideas, I just<br/>\nwanted to say I really respect her--and many of the rest of you as I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nyou post--for the courage to examine your ideas....as I examine my own.   We<br/>\nall make choices for heart-wrenching and heart-filling reasons.  Just<br/>\nbecause these are my ideas doesn&#39;t mean I think for a minute that they&#39;re<br/>\nright for Pat or for anyone else.  And my ideas are rarely set-in-stone!<br/>\nDialogue like this just helps me examine them--a process I enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!<br/>\nLeslie Moyer / Oklahoma<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31147,"nextTopicId":31200}}
