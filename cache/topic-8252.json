I, too , was very shy as a <br/>\nchild.  It was difficult for me, too, to relax, and be open and friendly when <br/>\nmeeting new people.  My older brother was always more the extrovert type, and <br/>\nI always found myself wishing I could be make myself more outgoing like that. <br/>\n I did become more outgoing as I grew up, and could take initiative in <br/>\nconversations, etc... and ended up marrying an extremely extroverted guy!  I <br/>\nguess we balance each other out!  When I was a teacher, I often would have to <br/>\nspeak before groups, and even presented a workshop for about 200 people.  <br/>\nWow!  I came a long way, baby! :)                           Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8249,"nextTopicId":8253}}
