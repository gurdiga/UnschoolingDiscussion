In Ohio, legally, your<br/>\nkids would be considered truant.  You run the risk of being arrested and<br/>\nlosing your kids if you choose not to notify.  Now if some brave soul<br/>\nwants to take the risk and challenge that law (and take on CPS too), I&#39;d<br/>\nbe behind them 100% BUT it ain&#39;t gonna be me.  My son has way too many<br/>\nproblems for me to allow him to be put in foster care or in public school<br/>\nfor any amount of time no matter how short and that&#39;s where he would be<br/>\nwhile the case wound it&#39;s way through the legal system.  Now, if it were<br/>\njust my daughters in question, I&#39;d probably discuss it with them and if<br/>\nthey agreed and understood the risks, I&#39;d probably do it.  I&#39;d love to<br/>\nput my oldest back in high school just to watch the fallout but she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t wanna go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone who doesn&#39;t register with the state isn&#39;t a home educator?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m literally not part of the system in New Mexico.
