Thanks for the web sites, too!  I could have googled them I know but really, yesterday I was too busy goggling to google &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday afternoon I cleaned out a big old dog kennel for the goats.  It was left by the previous owner and was full of nasty old sheep bones.  It&#39;s in a pen with a wattle tree and some nice long grass.  The goats like it in there.  I think that relieved a little of my &#39;stuff&#39; that I&#39;m feeling right now.  I was worried about the goats not having anything to graze on and nibble.  Now I don&#39;t have to walk them unless I really want to have fun with them.  That&#39;s one thing off my mind.  I think the getting out in the fresh air and working my butt off helped a lot too.  The endorphins were flowing and I felt good when I&#39;d finished and the goats were in there munching the tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe puppies - now that the goats have a new day home, I&#39;ve moved the puppies into the goats old day home which is just outside the loungeroom window.  I can see what they&#39;re doing, we can all interact casually with them when we go outside on little errands to the bin or whatever.  I don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re just stuck in the cat enclosure being miserable.  At night they can go into the cat enclosure because it&#39;s more secure.  That frees up the shed (which we used to live in) so that I can clean up the floor (disinfect from the puppy doings lol) and set it up as my craft room/visitors overnighter/party room(for Emma - she&#39;s a party girl).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I got the animals feed ready and went to wake up Emma.  &quot;Are you coming to help with the animals, honey?&quot;  &quot;Can you do it alone this morning mum?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be able to say &quot;yeah, sure, not a problem, honey&quot; and really mean it and smile and tuck her quilt around her snugly so she doesn&#39;t get cold.  Instead I said &quot;yeah, sure&quot; with a half smiling voice but inside my guts had started churning.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because I&#39;m disappointed with my own attitude and not really disappointed with the kids attitudes.  They&#39;re kids.  They have a lot of years to sort out their feelings.  Me dumping guilt on them isn&#39;t going to make the sorting easier for them.  I&#39;d be doing this stuff if I didn&#39;t have kids and I&#39;d be doing it because I wanted to do it.  I want to do it now.  I like the animals.  I like talking to them and being cuddled by them (even the goats cuddle lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have lots of issues to deal with.  I don&#39;t think any are really from my childhood.  It&#39;s mostly adult stuff - oh I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s all childhood but didn&#39;t come out til I was an adult.  Anyway it&#39;s all there and it doesn&#39;t go away.  None of it to do with alcoholic parent/parents thank goddish.  I feel alone.  I hate that.  Like there&#39;s someone missing that I need.  I&#39;m in a house full of kids and animals and I feel alone.  Now I&#39;m getting somewhere.  Thanks guys, I need to let myself feel sad about something.

resentful, now it&#39;s sneaking out of my mouth<br/>\nresentful.� *sigh*� I know that I&#39;m doing it.� I know that it&#39;s dragging me<br/>\ndown (honestly don&#39;t think the kids take that much notice because I go<br/>\nthrough cycles like this).� I don&#39;t want to be the person that I&#39;m being.�<br/>\nI&#39;m tired on top of it too so that&#39;s not helping and is maybe the cause of<br/>\nit a bit too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the thing that makes me feel the worst is that it&#39;s ALL MY DOING.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;yes, you can come in the house tiny feral kitten&quot;<br/>\nI said &quot;yes let&#39;s get two goats that I&#39;ll have to bottle feed three times a<br/>\nday&quot;<br/>\nI said (last Saturday) &quot;oh look at these poor pathetic defenceless fluffy<br/>\npuppies, yes we&#39;ll bring them home so they can poo and pee everywhere and<br/>\nneed lots of attention and eat enormous amounts of food and grow into high<br/>\nenergy border collie/labradors&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI never wanted pets.� I always said I didn&#39;t want pets.� So what the hell is<br/>\nwrong with me that I went from no pets to 5 pets in just 9 months??!!� It<br/>\nwas all my decisions too!� I didn&#39;t have kids nagging me for these animals.�<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t even know about the goats and the puppies!!!� Oh bugger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew how much responsibility I&#39;d be taking on.� Yeah, I was hopeful that<br/>\nthe kids would be soooooo happy to have the pets that they&#39;d joyfully help<br/>\nme with looking after them and they do help a bit.�<br/>\n<br/>\nI just need a big hoooooge kick up the bum.� So kick me people!� My head<br/>\nvoices just aren&#39;t doing the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be excited and happy to go and feed the goats and the puppys.� I<br/>\nam for the morning feed but then my tiredness catches up and I&#39;m a grumpy<br/>\nbitch for the rest of the day.� Aaarrgh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to smile at the kids and go outside and play with the puppies and the<br/>\nkids together all at the same time but then I go into freak out mode and I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to watch everyone all at the same time and I give orders and I feel<br/>\nlike I&#39;m making everyone miserable.� And I worry that I&#39;m not gonna get<br/>\nanything done inside that I need to do to have a reasonably sane household.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could rave on for hours.� I think I&#39;d better right all this down in a book<br/>\nsomewhere so I can get it out of my head.�<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that unschooling is about life.� It is life.� It&#39;s my life.� I just<br/>\nwant to be better at it and let go of the resentment (which is mostly<br/>\nresentment at myself I think).� I need tools for that.� I need to move<br/>\ntoward the joy.� It has to come from within.� I know that.� I need help with<br/>\nit.� Help me.� I&#39;m ready.� Okay, time for me to go and breathe - I can feel<br/>\nthe hysterical laughter starting up and I need to nip it in the bud or I&#39;ll<br/>\nreally freak everyone out LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nLee-Ann in Australia :)<br/>\nbreathing, breathing, smilingish, smilingish<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I am a people pleaser. I say <br/>\nyes, even when I know damn good and well I should say no. I often then feel <br/>\nresentful because I&#39;m stuck in the yes, that I really wanted to be no, but didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to &quot;hurt&quot; anyone. But then who ends up &quot;hurt&quot;...me and everyone in my path <br/>\nwhile I am resentful. I am working hard on not jumping to rescuing the world, <br/>\nvolunteeering for crap I don&#39;t want to do and fixing everyone around me. And <br/>\nin working on this, I have found I do some of it so that I don&#39;t have to deal <br/>\nwith certain parts of myself and the flip side that wants to be the <br/>\nmartyr/rescuer. I have plenty of my own crap to work on, but it&#39;s easy to ignore when <br/>\nI&#39;m helping or taking care of everyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although I won&#39;t kick you, I will say, you are not the only one and <br/>\nsometimes knowing that can help immensely. I have one friend who happily kicks me <br/>\nwhen she sees me running on empty and will thwap me in the head when she sees or <br/>\nfeels me readying up to take on more. I have to say, I really appreciate it <br/>\nwhen she does that though. It&#39;s more comforting than anything else because she <br/>\nknows how I operate and can really get me to stop and question my own motives.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you and feel free to vent anytime!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":61863311,"authorName":"Carolyn Ashley-Wheeler","from":"&quot;Carolyn Ashley-Wheeler&quot; &lt;carolyn.ashley-wheeler@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] attitude adjustment - totally self indulgent","postDate":"1063184126","msgId":80160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDUwMWMzNzc3OSQ0NzRmOGRkMCRjNDkxNjI1MUBEaW5pbmdSb29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAxNGMwMWMzNzczZiQzMjRmMmIwMCQ5YWJjZmVhOUBwYmVsbD4="},"prevInTopic":80155,"nextInTopic":80173,"prevInTime":80159,"nextInTime":80161,"topicId":80142,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sheesh, definately not a good day.
