I have tried to quit saying &quot;after you eat dinner&quot; for sweets requests, offered suggestions or given her things to snack on while waiting for dinner, and have in general changed a lot of how we&#39;ve dealt with food.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, as I was preparing dinner, DD started to head toward the fridge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m making dinner.  It&#39;ll be done in about 10 minutes, can&#39;t  you wait?&quot;  I replied (getting slightly annoyed).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But I&#39;m hungry now,&quot; she said, starting to whine.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m starting to think that this is crazy and wondering why she can&#39;t just wait 10 or 15 more minutes, yada yada yada...  Then, I stop.  Maybe she is hungry, maybe her stomach hurts a little, maybe it won&#39;t hurt if she does eat something first...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I was going to save the pineapple for dinner, but if you&#39;d like you can have it now,&quot;  I offered.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll take that!&quot;  She says, ecstatic because she loves pineapple.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow... that was easy.  She ate her pineapple, I finished making the chicken nuggets and green beans (which were her requests too), and we ate our dinner - peacefully.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big thing that I realized this morning is that she never asked for dessert.  That used to be her whole concern - even from waking up in the morning.  She would ask &quot;What are we having for dinner?  What&#39;s for dessert?&quot;  Now, if she wants some, she eats it.  And, I am doing the same.  Sometimes I will want something when she does, other times I won&#39;t - so I don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on, we were working on a computer game that we&#39;d gotten from the library.  It was particularly challenging, and we&#39;d switch off and on taking turns trying to figure it out.  At one point, while it was my turn, I heard her munching on something.  I didn&#39;t say a word.  She had grabbed the bag of chips and had eaten 2 or 3 - then was off and wanting her turn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had also gotten out the remainder of some carrot cake we had bought (her newly discovered favorite and my long-time weakness...) and 2 forks.  I suggested I make some coffee, and she was so excited.  We shared the remainder, and she actually stopped at some point.  I am the one who finished, and consequently had to admit, &quot;I ate wayyyy too much!  I feel full & extremely sugared!&quot;  She giggled and said, &quot;I&#39;m not!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was nice and amazing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
