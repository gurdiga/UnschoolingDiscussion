Not a trick, a tool.  A way to think.  When someone is<br/>\nunhappy<br/>\n&gt; because his stuff isn&#39;t perfect (garb, armor, camping gear) I&#39;ve said &quot;You<br/>\ncan&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; move from nothing to everything all of a sudden.&quot;   That seems obvious,<br/>\nbut is<br/>\n&gt; it?  People want to BE what they think, and often our thoughts are pretty<br/>\n&gt; elaborate.   But we act in this moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The first time this particular trick came to me, I was advising someone<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; was being knighted in the morning, and was staying awake all night to take<br/>\n&gt; counsel of those who outranked him.   I was in with him, and I could feel<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; sorrow and concern about not having a perfectly &quot;period&quot; camp.  I said<br/>\n&quot;When you<br/>\n&gt; buy a tent, and your choices are nylon and canvas, choose canvas.  If your<br/>\n&gt; choices are orange or brown, choose orange.  Incrementally, your set of<br/>\nstuff will<br/>\n&gt; get better.  When  you have a choice, make the more medieval choice.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And with parenting, once you have your goal in mind, live in the moment by<br/>\n&gt; learning to see that you have choices, and then make the choice that is<br/>\nnearer<br/>\n&gt; your goal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want to learn patience, make the more patient choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want to move toward natural learning, make the input-rich choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you want to become more light-hearted, make the brighter, more sparkly<br/>\n&gt; choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A trap and a bog-hole in personal growth is the idea people get sometimes<br/>\n&gt; which is &quot;I had no choice.&quot;     If you feel you have no choice, you should<br/>\nlook<br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce has a great riff on this.  She says you don&#39;t HAVE to wash our<br/>\ndishes.<br/>\n&gt; You could buy paper plates.   She has lots of good examples like that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But it&#39;s sad and depressing when people feel trapped or helpless.   So<br/>\nlearn<br/>\n&gt; not to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Breathe and look.  Do I HAVE to take care of my kids?  No, I choose to.<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re all gone right now, and I have a van, a charge card, and a<br/>\npassport.  I<br/>\n&gt; could be ten thousand miles away by Monday, having plastic surgery in some<br/>\n&gt; clinic where the pre-med students ended up. &lt;g&gt;  I will probably choose<br/>\nNOT to do<br/>\n&gt; that.  But having envisioned it, I know more clearly that I will be here<br/>\nMonday<br/>\n&gt; when my family returns because I CHOOSE to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (And if you&#39;re thinking, &quot;Well I don&#39;t have a van and a charge card and a<br/>\n&gt; passport,&quot; don&#39;t whine about your lack of choices.

There ARE choices, not all as merry as plastic<br/>\nsurgery in<br/>\n&gt; New Delhi.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So.  You have choices.  Make them as mindfully as you can, and if your<br/>\ngoal<br/>\n&gt; is to be more mindful, figure out two choices and make the more mindful<br/>\none.<br/>\n&gt; Next time, your two choices might be two BETTER choices, and you make the<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; mindful one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s the main point of a tape called Peaceful Parenting that&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; presentation I gave with Richard Prystowsky a couple of years ago.

It&#39;s called &quot;Wherever you go, there you are&quot; by John Kabat-zin (also writes about natural learning). He gave me a bit of wisdom that has helped me more lately...he talks about seeing the world, the daily activities from the vantage point of death. What will be happening when you&#39;re gone? All this stuff continues, all the things that we get stressed about will be there, but WE won&#39;t have to worry about it. He applies that to distancing yourself from situations and events, becoming &quot;unattached&quot; (the buddhist way) and thereby seeing things MORE clearly and able to function better.<br/>\nThis daily &quot;dying&quot; helps you detach emotional responses and respond in a way that you really believe is helpful. It&#39;s all goes back to mindful living....I find the buddhist philosophies are the most helpful for actually GETTING there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love Thich Nat Hahn&#39;s work too.  And I really enjoyed reading about your paradigm shift Jennifer. I think looking back and analyzing situations when your temper or anxiety kicked in, helps you react better the next time a similar situation arises.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read Andrea&#39;s description of how she feels, I remember feeling just like that...still do sometimes.
