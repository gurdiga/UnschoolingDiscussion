I often threatened to hurt myself in <br/>\na way that I would be bruised so that I could call the police and get <br/>\nthem in trouble.  I told them that I would lie and say they did it.  <br/>\nI never went through with it, and now I am SO glad I didn&#39;t.  As <br/>\nstrict as my parents were, they were the parents God gave me and they <br/>\nwere the right parents for me.  That&#39;s not to say they couldn&#39;t have <br/>\ndone some things differently, but they also did a lot of things <br/>\nright.  Had I done that, I probably would have been placed in foster <br/>\ncare and would have been emotionally scarred for life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as much as I don&#39;t agree with the way many parents raise their <br/>\nkids, God placed those families there and they have the right to <br/>\nraise them as they see fit, even if it means the kids get punished in <br/>\nways I don&#39;t approve of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like spanking, but I will stick up for a parent&#39;s right to do <br/>\nit.  I don&#39;t see it as abuse.  As a boy, my grandpa was taken out to <br/>\nthe barn to be punished with his father&#39;s belt.  His 9 brothers and <br/>\nsisters were punished this way too.  Yes, I think it&#39;s terrible, but <br/>\nhe and all his brothers and sisters grew up to be healthy, productive <br/>\nadults.  It wouldn&#39;t have been a good thing to take those kids away <br/>\nfrom their parents because they feared their dad&#39;s belt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as a child&#39;s total rights to do anything at all--hang out with <br/>\nanyone or wear any kind of clothing at all--no.  I am very free with <br/>\nwhat my kids can wear, but I would have my limits.   If, for example, <br/>\nmy kids wanted to hang out with satanists or wear satanic t-shirts, <br/>\nthey would be strictly forbidden.  I don&#39;t think they ever would, but <br/>\nI reserve the right at any time to step in and say, &quot;You&#39;ve crossed <br/>\nthe line, God gave you to me to raise, and I will someday have to <br/>\nanswer to Him for how I raise you. You may not go there, you may not <br/>\nwear that, and you may not spend time with those people.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2519","postDate":"1035308545","msgId":47309,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDIyMTc0MjI1LjkxNzUzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5REI0Qzg0LjE1MzIlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":47306,"nextInTopic":47900,"prevInTime":47308,"nextInTime":47310,"topicId":47294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeah,  I guess so, that its a good thing,  but sometimes its such a hard thing.
