It&#39;s been a great year and we&#39;re happy that the <br/>\nlist has grown and people seem to find it useful. We have found that <br/>\nour list policies are working well, in general, to let people know what <br/>\nto expect from the list. However, we&#39;re changing our policy that people <br/>\nwait two weeks before posting and will, from now on, just &quot;suggest&quot; <br/>\nthat people read for at least a couple of weeks in order to get to know <br/>\nthe list. We&#39;re making this change because it is a lot of work for <br/>\nmoderators to constantly keep track of how long new people have been on <br/>\nthe list and because people have complained about this requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam sorooshian</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96412,"nextTopicId":96447}}
