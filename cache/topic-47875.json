Can you put a 9 <br/>\nyear old in first grade?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried out a cyber-charter school for my kids.  It was tempting--<br/>\n&quot;free&quot; computer, &quot;free&quot; art lessons, music lessons, and phys ed costs <br/>\n(paying for soccer, basketball fees).  I was told when we signed up <br/>\nwe could take only foreign languages and electives.  Then they kept <br/>\nadding more and more restrictions.  They said, well now you have to <br/>\ntake all &quot;core&quot; subjects, but you can go at your own pace, take 2 <br/>\nmonths to finish one assignment if you want, and you can pick and <br/>\nchoose which activities you like.  And of course it got to the point <br/>\nwhere you had to do all lessons assigned by the end of the year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always been skeptical of &quot;free&quot; government programs.  But I <br/>\nasked these specific questions before I got involved, and figured a <br/>\npublic cyber charter school wouldn&#39;t lie.  Ha!  <br/>\nNow I know more than ever that NOTHING is free.  I would be very, <br/>\nvery careful, because public money always comes with strings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;mabeitzel&quot; &lt;mabeitzel@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; We just got into the IDEA program.

They unfairly called this <br/>\n&quot;Sandra Dodd Cheats on Tests.&quot; I never did! I&#39;m simply and subversively <br/>\nrecommending that in the absence of the opportunity to avoid them altogether, <br/>\nthe second best option might be invalidating them. (The paragraph beneath <br/>\nappeared in the newsletter too; I&#39;ve added links but not text to it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the topic of testing: I have a very serious suggestion which will seem <br/>\nlike a joke, but I&#39;m absolutely soberly recommending this:  <br/>\n<br/>\nCheat. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t cheat to get a better score or a worse score. Just invalidate the test <br/>\neither by taking too long, or making a pattern with all the answer marks in <br/>\nodd-numbered sections, or using dice to decide anything for which the answer <br/>\nisn&#39;t absolutely obvious to the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parent and child both know in advance that the scores could not <br/>\nPOSSIBLY actually begin to attempt to reflect the child&#39;s &quot;actual&quot; knowledge <br/>\nor intelligence or aptitude or value, then that number will lose its juju and <br/>\nits ability to harm the child-parent relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all the things I believe strongly, one which has changed my life as <br/>\nprofoundly as any one other belief is my personal knowledge that test scores <br/>\ncan and do (can&#39;t fail to) affect the treatment a child receives at his <br/>\nparents&#39; hands. High scores, low scores, average scores--no matter. Parents <br/>\ncease to treat the child as his original, known self and color him soul deep <br/>\nwith that number. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy life would have been different. My husband&#39;s life would have been <br/>\ndifferent, without those 5th and 8th grade ITBS scores. I venture to say <br/>\nwithout even knowing who is reading this that your life would have been <br/>\ndifferent, and specifically I believe your life would have been better, had <br/>\nnot you been branded with a number on your &quot;permanent record&quot; (there&#39;s a big <br/>\nmean scary joke, the &quot;permanence&quot; and important parts) as a young innocent <br/>\nten or thirteen year old full of potential, at some unknown point on a <br/>\nlearning curve which might soon be at its settled-out point, or might just be <br/>\nbeginning. <br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright © 2000, Sandra Dodd.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":53054552,"authorName":"mabeitzel","from":"&quot;mabeitzel&quot; &lt;mabeitzel@...&gt;","profile":"mabeitzel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"suggestions on IDEA","postDate":"1035509886","msgId":47875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFwYTc5dSszMDY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47899,"prevInTime":47874,"nextInTime":47876,"topicId":47875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We just got into the IDEA program.
