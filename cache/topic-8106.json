The checker said to dd &quot;oh<br/>\nyour mom teaches you?&quot;  and dd said &quot;no my mom doesn&#39;t teach me anything&quot;<br/>\nLOL, talk about a cringing moment.  My children have never been to school,<br/>\nso they don&#39;t know that there  are different hsing methods.  What I explained<br/>\nto my children how school was and what they actually did there and then <br/>\nexplained to her that we learn from the world around us and from reading<br/>\nbooks and playiing and doing things, she really picked up on it right away.<br/>\nShe was almost 5 at the time.  She will now tell you that you don&#39;t have to go<br/>\nto school to learn things, but by going places and doing things and exploring.<br/>\nEvery evening my kids ask me if tomorrow is a day off (meaning are we going<br/>\nanywhere, be it fun/park/or just running errands).  Tonight they asked me and<br/>\nI said yes, tomorrow is but on Sunday we have a fun nature walk planned with<br/>\nsome of our friends.  They were all excited and wished it were tomorrow.  <br/>\nAfter<br/>\na moment, my dd asks me&quot;mom, do kids who go to school get a day off on their<br/>\nbirthdays?&quot;  I said &quot;no they don&#39;t&quot; and you should have seen and heard her <br/>\nexpression!!  &quot;They don&#39;t ?!?!  I don&#39;t ever want to go to school!!&quot;  She was<br/>\njust incredulous!  She said do they get any days off?  I told her yes they do <br/>\nand<br/>\nwent on to explain that there are 7 days in a week and on Monday when our <br/>\nsecretary is here, kids go to school every day for five days including Friday<br/>\nwhen we go to the Farmers Market, but that the next day, tomorrow , Saturday, <br/>\nwould be their day off and that they would have two days off together before <br/>\nthey would go back to school. (I also threw in that they would have to do <br/>\nschoolwork on their days off too &lt;eg&gt;) Oh and when dad comes home from<br/>\nwork and says what did you do today, they often say play, but if they can&#39;t<br/>\nremember, he chimes in for them and says did you play today?!  I guess he <br/>\nsees the value in play and just being a kid too!! <br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Barb Eaton","from":"Barb Eaton &lt;homemama@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"qoVvNqRwI8ChSk77cD1QTQKP2TYlnduJ2O3WEgFnk20kx6Mn9kAZqTdY6GM2wxPsGrNKlid5bWslKTvVlLTfXQmx8THUPOIW","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What do you tell your children?","postDate":"955770387","msgId":8152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1MUQ1RTUyLjE2MEUlaG9tZW1hbWFAaW5maW5ldC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWJmYTY2YiRjOGE5MTk2MCQ3ZDgzNDJkOEBKb3NoSGVhdGg+"},"prevInTopic":8145,"nextInTopic":8156,"prevInTime":8151,"nextInTime":8153,"topicId":8106,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joshua, Who is the author of this book again?

I think they feel as though they are <br/>\naliens in those situations and have realized that it is best to avoid <br/>\ntelling these types of people.......<br/>\nWhen we first started unschooling.....before that we were just <br/>\nplaying!.....they did tell people that they played all day (and I DO <br/>\nstill), but now they will tell them other things like we sold candy or we <br/>\nmade cookies.  In PA you have to keep a journal and they help me with it <br/>\nand see what I record so they know that their playing amounts to <br/>\nsomething.  They just took their tests the other day and shocked and <br/>\nsurprised me to no end what they DID learn!<br/>\nWhew! IT WORKS!!<br/>\nAnyways<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to say that my 9 year old has not started developing nor has my 11 <br/>\nyear old BUT there was a point where I thought that Brittany&#39;s hormones <br/>\nwere pumping (she is 11) BUT it was actually too much socialization ---she <br/>\nwas giving me the attitude (that I thought was normal---NOPE) and other <br/>\nsuch things that you would relate to maturity...<br/>\nSO I locked her back up in the dungeon (NO really I am kidding)<br/>\nSo I said Brittany I think that you are picking up some bad habits from all <br/>\nthis socialization (brownies, dance, etc) and I cannot live like this and <br/>\nyou are not happy either so I think that we need to cut back and come back <br/>\nhome and if you think that you can pull together and realize that it is not <br/>\nacceptable to behave in such a negative fashion then we can try it <br/>\nagain.  We did not leave her classes as she saw the errror of mimicking <br/>\nthis behavior.....And I saw where she was just asking for some <br/>\ncompanionship (instead of rocking and boob) that she had moved on to <br/>\nanother level in out relationship and instead of moving away or out she had <br/>\nmoved closer and freer to me<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is wonderful that she is growing and I enjoy every moment of it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot wait till she has more growth and I can share in her life on <br/>\nanother level<br/>\nLove POD....who is up at 5 AM with a stiff neck (I fear the chiro)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Free E-Cards, Screensavers, and Digital Pictures!<br/>\n&gt;Corbis.com:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/448294/_/955611749/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3358/7/_/448294/_/955611749/</a><br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joshua Heath","from":"&quot;Joshua Heath&quot; &lt;heathfam@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5BpQB87fwtJ0Peg8ZTbBZM8x92mSbbkCGneHLRKx80c-BYe-VETKge1MX6sIRoXnJHyjAXvpvu307ChZvjef1cALPIpTD912vwI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What do you tell your children?","postDate":"955611802","msgId":8106,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTcwMWJmYTUxYiRmMzcwODFjMCQyOTgzNDJkOEBKb3NoSGVhdGg+","referencesHeader":"PEIwMDAzMDQ0NDQyQGhlcmN1bGVzLmNueC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8122,"prevInTime":8105,"nextInTime":8107,"topicId":8106,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I started out &quot;schooling&quot; but<br/>\nquickly moved over into unchooling.  At first I just did it, but after a<br/>\nmonth or so, I felt they deserved an explaination of why daddy wasnt making<br/>\nthem do any schoolwork they didnt want to.  I explained to them that I<br/>\nbelieved children learn best when they are interested in what they are<br/>\nlearning... and that as long as they were at home I didn&#39;t intend to force<br/>\nany learning on them.  I also explained that learning is like breathing...<br/>\nyou are always learning every moment.  We had this conversation a few<br/>\ntimes... Once it went no-where.  The next times the boys really cought on to<br/>\nthe idea... saying that in that moment they had just learned that they were<br/>\nalways learning , and then going on giving me a play by play announcement of<br/>\nall the things they were learning as they sat there talking to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day our 6 yo floored us all by proclaiming to some people my wife<br/>\nwas introducing him to, when asked what he did at home for school,  &quot;I am in<br/>\nthe school of life.... God is my teacher!&quot; Pretty surprizing since we are<br/>\nnot at all religous.  We do talk about spiritual matters freely though...<br/>\nBut I still get the &quot;we didnt do anything&quot; routine from them often as well.<br/>\nI have tried going through with them all the worthwhile things that I saw<br/>\nhappen during a day when they say something like this.  I think it makes an<br/>\nimpression about how playing at this and that are valued equally to doing a<br/>\nmath work-sheet in my eyes.. I think it helps them realize that they are not<br/>\nwasting their time at all... but in fact are learning in their own style.<br/>\nThings like pointing out the amount of addition and division required to<br/>\nplay risk, or the strategy involved in chess, the science in making bread,<br/>\nor the care and effort involved in emptying the dishwasher.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8155,"nextTopicId":8158}}
