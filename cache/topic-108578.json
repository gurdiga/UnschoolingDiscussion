That&#39;s what the conferences and what unschooling support groups can be <br/>\nbest at--candid opportunities to interact with kids who have grown up that way <br/>\nand turned out well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Marty attended a weeklong junior police academy a couple of years back, <br/>\none of the sergeants told me effusively at the end how wonderful Marty was, <br/>\nand said   &quot;You can always tell when a kid comes from a home with a lot of <br/>\ndiscipline and rules.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked up the exact quote in a conversation I saved from the time, and I&#39;m <br/>\nglad because I had forgotten what or whether I said anything back (because the <br/>\nmemory of that moment still stuns me).   Part of the reason for putting this <br/>\nhere is to indicate that a kid who was raised gently and respectfully was <br/>\nstill competent and confident in a situation designed specifically NOT to be <br/>\ngentle and respectful, but to simulate a police academy training week.   Yeah, they <br/>\nwere 12 to 14   years old, and yeah it wasn&#39;t really boot camp.   But I think <br/>\nsome people (dads especially, who don&#39;t have their moms and grandmas voices <br/>\nin their heads but who have the harsh pronouncements of dads, grandpas, uncles, <br/>\nex-Marine neighbors and teachers, manly shaming messages) would assume that a <br/>\nboy who wasn&#39;t pressured and &quot;made to work&quot; and all would be hopelessly lost <br/>\nin a macho high-pressure situation.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a conversation with a childless adult friend who knows Marty really <br/>\nwell:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      AND Top Gun came with $15 gift certificate to Oshman&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDWSO21:      Nice!<br/>\nSandraDodd:      So you know how many paint balls that will buy? <br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      HARDLY ANY.<br/>\nDWSO21:      I was about to say, &quot;probably about 3.&quot;<br/>\nSandraDodd:      But wait.   I was going to tell you the best part and got <br/>\nsidetracked with all this chit chat.<br/>\nDWSO21:      Tell me the best part!<br/>\nSandraDodd:      After the dinner they fed us (Quarters barbecue stuff, <br/>\nserved up by some of their meanest instructors &lt;g&gt;), I went to sit with the <br/>\ncoordinator/spokesman of the whole thing, and I thanked him and told him Marty had a <br/>\ngreat time.<br/>\nDWSO21:      and then?<br/>\nSandraDodd:      He told me Marty was great to work with.<br/>\nSandraDodd:      And in the course of our both saying nice things about <br/>\nMarty, he said &quot;You can always tell when a kid comes from a home with a lot of <br/>\ndiscipline and rules.&quot;<br/>\nDWSO21:      ...and then you told him Marty&#39;s never been to school in his <br/>\nlife, didn&#39;t you?<br/>\nDWSO21:      hee hee!<br/>\nDWSO21:      That&#39;s a riot!<br/>\nSandraDodd:      I told him that Monday had been Marty&#39;s first day of school <br/>\nof any sort.<br/>\nDWSO21:      what did he say next?<br/>\nSandraDodd:      And that when he got home he had re-written his notes.   It <br/>\nwas the first time he had ever taken notes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was four gun safety rules and the names of all the instructors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      &quot;Good.   Initiative! &quot;   He said.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him we hardly have ANY rules at our house, we just tell them to make <br/>\ngood choices that don&#39;t hurt people.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      He said the homeschoolers he&#39;s met haven&#39;t tended to be very <br/>\noutgoing but Marty was (I forget what he said)<br/>\nSandraDodd: . . . He was all a-glow from luv of Marty.<br/>\nDWSO21:      That&#39;s SO cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      I&#39;ll just show you the videos when you get a chance.   Two <br/>\nshort news things and a five minute summary video (nicely put together!   we <br/>\nget a free copy for providing a blank tape)<br/>\n<br/>\nDWSO21:      I want to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDWSO21:      Aren&#39;t you afraid, though, that being a cop will wreck Marty&#39;s <br/>\nnaturally sunny disposition?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      Yeah.   He might not become a cop.   But it will be cop <br/>\nappreciation.   Like when you are learning to play an instrument and quit, but <br/>\nstill afterwards you know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not when you hear people playing <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      Oh!   They did a crime scene for them too.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThey set up a room with clues and a storyline and the kids went in and found <br/>\nthe right clues, in groups.<br/>\nSandraDodd:      He had a lot of fun with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      And they visited the forensics lab (right across the parking <br/>\nlot) and the guy showed them real crime scene photos.   They said &quot;Dead <br/>\nbody!&quot; and he said &quot;if you&#39;re good.&quot;<br/>\nDWSO21:      and were they good?<br/>\nDWSO21:      Did they see the dead body?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandraDodd:      He showed them a body after while.   Drug murder, at a <br/>\nparty, and let them figure out why the blood pooled as it did.   How was he when he <br/>\nwas first shot, and then how did he move (or did someone else move him) after <br/>\na while.   (photo)<br/>\nSandraDodd:      But one of the first ones was a kitchen.   &quot;See anything?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;bullet hole in the linoleum.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty said he said &quot;That floor does NOT   go well with that wall.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOrdinarily wise cracks were not being made, because they&#39;d make them do <br/>\npushups, but they had been left with a nice lab guy who wasn&#39;t into that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he said   &quot;If this were a fashion class, you&#39;d be right.&quot;<br/>\nSandraDodd:      And then he showed a second set of photos.   They spray <br/>\nsomething on the floor and then photographic it under black light and blood showed <br/>\nup all over that floor and in the hall, and on the side of the sink.<br/>\nSandraDodd:      So if you&#39;re going to mop up a crime scene.   REALLY rinse.  <br/>\n Maybe use hydrogen peroxide.    Rinse and repeat FOR SURE.<br/>\nDWSO21:      Good to know!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Book suggestions for &quot;getting&quot; the concept, please?","postDate":"1127896156","msgId":108579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDkwLjY2ZmZhMjZmLjMwNmJhYjA5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":108578,"nextInTopic":108581,"prevInTime":108578,"nextInTime":108580,"topicId":108578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-188630251\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Which book would folks here reccomend best or first for getting the<br/>\n&quot;idea&quot; of unschooling from the parenting perspective across to a &quot;not<br/>\ngetting it&quot; husband?
