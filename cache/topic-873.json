Don&#39;t schedule anything - go with the flow of their rythms.  <br/>\nLet them get totally into whatever it is that interests them (Yes, even if it <br/>\nis all video games all the time or all TV all the time.)  YOU plan for some <br/>\nlittle trips for yourself - &quot;I&#39;m going to the park today, anyone want to <br/>\ncome??&quot; if they say yes - great, if they say no - fine too.  I would be going <br/>\nto museums, parks, shopping, book stores - whatever it is you like, and <br/>\nalways invite the kids along.  Never force it on them to participate - just <br/>\nmake sure YOU enjoy yourself.  Soon, the kids will catch on to the fun you <br/>\nare having.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t set up a time limit for &quot;deschooling&quot; either.  Just watch your kids, <br/>\nare they getting their sparkle back? Great - then make some suggestions about <br/>\na fun thing to do.  Are they appearing depressed? Withdrawn? Let them chill <br/>\nif that is what they need.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is going to be MOST difficult for you - because you are going to look and <br/>\nsay &quot;but what about the stuff they aren&#39;t learning???&quot; -- Look for what they <br/>\nARE learning.  Are they on the computer? They are strengthening reading and <br/>\nwriting skills.  Are they playing massive amounts of video games? There is <br/>\nmath and dedcutive reasonsing and all kinds of critical thinking in video <br/>\ngames.

I <br/>\nwish I had found it when the deschooling question was first asked, but it&#39;s <br/>\nstill good a few days later. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t remember who asked the original <br/>\nquestions; sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; All in all this has been a great experience and we all agree HS is where <br/>\nwe want to be...but does any one have input on the motivation/curiosity <br/>\nissue?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven before I read the rest of the post my question for you was whether <br/>\nyou&#39;re wanting their learning parcelled out evenly over the year, over the <br/>\nweek, over the day. &lt;g&gt;   Life is lumpy.   Like statistics, like chaos <br/>\ntheory, there are &quot;busy&quot; times and big loops which seem to be going nowhere <br/>\nand actually have a destination.    Think &quot;leaps and bounds&quot; (with rests in <br/>\nbetween).   Cats are certainly bright and curious, and they sleep more than <br/>\nhalf of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Do I just need to be encouraging and bide my time as the habits are <br/>\nrelearned?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s waiting.  And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;relearning&quot; or &quot;habits,&quot; <br/>\nbut until the school habits are forgotten.  It&#39;s always easier to cut <br/>\nsomething off than for it to grow back, and school sometimes cuts kids off <br/>\nfrom their natural curiosity and desire.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;We (spouse and I) do want them to learn piano and math at a steady pace, <br/>\nthe rest we would like to leave for them to choose???  Comments???&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Steady pace&quot; jumped out at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if they have a great piano week where they practice two hours a day and <br/>\nthen are tired of it for the rest of the month?  It wouldn&#39;t all be lost and <br/>\nover and ruined.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if, one day, they just GET some mathematical concept.  Will that reset <br/>\nthe level at which you want them to work steadily?<br/>\n<br/>\nKids at school each &quot;get&quot; multiplication once, and after that they&#39;re just  <br/>\nhearing the explanation over and over while the teacher rephrases and <br/>\nre-introduces and reviews in hopes that all the other kids will &quot;get it&quot; that <br/>\nday.   (Reminds me of singing an invitational hymn three times because the <br/>\npreacher has his eye on one potential convert.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;steady&quot; pace schools simulate is 1) not real, and 2) not applicable to <br/>\nhomeschooling anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Having history&quot; 180 times a year is like trying to teach a pig to sing.   In <br/>\none hour an interested and curious (i.e. &quot;ripe&quot;) child might learn as much <br/>\nabout the Civil War or Apollo 11 as they would in a week at school (if ever). <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that the deschooling needed in this situation is more of the <br/>\nparents than the kids.   I still have subconscious school-stuff to slough <br/>\noff; it surfaces when I least expect it and I wrestle it, encapsulate it, and <br/>\ntry to forget it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":846,"nextTopicId":881}}
