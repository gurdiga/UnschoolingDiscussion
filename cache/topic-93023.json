Turns out it was the author of a book called &quot;Blown Away!&quot; (DD shuddered <br/>\n-- we must&#39;ve missed any explanation there might have been about why this <br/>\nwasn&#39;t as awful a title for a gun book as it sounded)<br/>\n<br/>\n       So now we&#39;re both paying attention to this unexpected topic of girls <br/>\nand guns. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Understand that guns are no part of any real experience she&#39;s had, or <br/>\nany curiosity she&#39;s ever expressed. So this was totally new to her, and quite <br/>\nuncommon territory for me too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n       We turn the interview up. The author says authoritatively that 75% of <br/>\nall girls and women over the age of 12 will be a crime victim and a third of <br/>\nthose crimes will be violent. So of course we need to know how to protect <br/>\nourselves and guns are the ideal way to shift power from men to women so they won&#39;t <br/>\nbe victimized (she goes on at some length about this.) <br/>\n<br/>\n       My first thought was that DD needn&#39;t be unduly scared (not of guns but <br/>\nmen!) so I commented that as a very tall and strong woman, I had never felt <br/>\nany particular need to arm myself against men. Even as a 12-year-old I was used <br/>\nto be mistaken for an adult and to looking down on my share of bald spots! So <br/>\nit never occurred to me to look for a way not to be victimized by men.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Then I thought I&#39;d change the subject from defense against crime and <br/>\nthe need to take power away from men, maybe by focusing on the math to see if <br/>\nmaybe the statistics weren&#39;t as bad as they sounded (I was trying to guessimate <br/>\nit quickly in my own mind, thinking the self-protection need seemed <br/>\nunrealistically high for boring, middle-class, university town dwellers like us.)<br/>\n<br/>\n       DD hates math almost to the point of being phobic about it. And I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t trying to teach it to her, I promise! But here was something she was <br/>\nriveted by at the moment, even if not exactly in a &quot;good&quot; way. <br/>\n<br/>\n       So, I muse aloud that if all the women over twelve were a whole <br/>\ndollar, then the author&#39;s 75% figure meant that 75 cents of that dollar became crime <br/>\nvictims. She nods and looks at me for more (I&#39;m still driving, remember.)<br/>\n<br/>\n       Well, then if one-third of those victims experience &quot;violent&quot; crime <br/>\nand one way of making 75 cents is with three quarters, then one-third of 75 is <br/>\none of those quarters, right? She looks surprised and smiles, and nods again.<br/>\n<br/>\n       So I say that&#39;s a lot less than three quarters of all women, isn&#39;t it? <br/>\nNow we can see that three-quarters of all women WON&#39;T ever be a victim of <br/>\nviolent crime, right? She is looking much more comfortable -- at least as I&#39;m <br/>\nhurtling down the interstate thinking there are all kinds of self-defense and <br/>\ngood driving is maybe a lot more important than good shooting to us &lt;grin&gt; -- <br/>\nwhen I have a further thought, spontaneous and maybe ill-advised if my purpose <br/>\nwas to make her feel safe, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n       &quot;Oh! And they say on average, violence tends to happen from people you <br/>\nknow, right?&quot; I say. Because that&#39;s who you are with almost all the time, so <br/>\nthis makes sense. Strangers don&#39;t figure into girls&#39; normal lives that much, <br/>\nrelative to relatives anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I explain there must be all the kinds of violence against teens -- <br/>\ngirls older than 12 but too young for responsible gun ownership at say, 18 -- <br/>\nviolence that happens in bad home situations with people girls know but wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a gun to protect themselves against, like date rape and stepfathers and <br/>\nstrange &quot;uncles&quot; or neighbors. <br/>\n<br/>\n       So I wonder if that 12-year-old statistic is a key to this picture, I <br/>\nsay. Maybe if they set the crime-counting starting point at 18- or 21-year-old <br/>\nwomen, the statistics would be quite different? We conclude together that <br/>\nteens could be at least half of those violence victims, and thus maybe only one <br/>\nwoman in ten who COULD actually use a gun responsibly for self-protection ever <br/>\nwould have cause to do so in her lifetime. And more importantly to us, that <br/>\nnine out of ten won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n       She is thinking along with me now, and about math! And reason. About <br/>\nsomething real that matters to her life. And she&#39;s *really* good at the <br/>\nthinking and reasoning part, even with no previous knowledge of guns or violence, and <br/>\nalmost none of simple fractions, much less of statistical misrepresentations <br/>\nfor effect!<br/>\n<br/>\n       But that&#39;s not the good part in my mind. HERE&#39;s the good part. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Again without knowing what I&#39;m gonna say until it comes out of my <br/>\nmouth, I start to admire her thinking and reasoning ability, and how well we just <br/>\nworked through the issue without being stampeded to a false and possibly <br/>\ndangerous conclusion, and I say *that* is a form of power, too. A way that girls <br/>\nand women can arm themselves at any age, not only protect to themselves <br/>\nphysically but against all manner of victimization, criminal or not, from any source <br/>\n-- and it was more important than any other method because I could guarantee <br/>\nthere was a 100% chance there&#39;d be cause to use it. Hadn&#39;t we just needed and <br/>\nused it, in fact?<br/>\n<br/>\n       Laughing now, she called out her own new statistic: Arm yourselves <br/>\nagainst stupidity! One-hundred percent of all girls and women will be the victims <br/>\nof attempted stupidity today!<br/>\n<br/>\n       I don&#39;t know what percent of her day was improved by that little <br/>\nmoment, or what value she would place on it, but I can speak for mine. Priceless! <br/>\n:) :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93048,"nextTopicId":92862}}
