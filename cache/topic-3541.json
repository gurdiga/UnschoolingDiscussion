She was asked what she thought and she said that she thought that Mama was<br/>\ndoing it.  This was confirmed and my daughter chortled with laughter she thought it<br/>\nwas wonderful that mama was going around the house doing all this Easter stuff.  She<br/>\nthought it was funny too.

One day,<br/>\n&gt; when he was about 4 or so, he heard that they weren&#39;t real and wanted an answer<br/>\n&gt; out of mommy.  She told him that Santa was just a story and all of the good stuff<br/>\n&gt; about the giving spirit.  But the question he came back with left her<br/>\n&gt; speechless!  He asked her, &quot;Then is Jesus real?&quot;  She realized that, as most<br/>\n&gt; children can&#39;t, her son couldn&#39;t differentiate between real and make-believe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just something more to add to the conversation.<br/>\n&gt; Living for Him,<br/>\n&gt; Faith<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nbest wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.
