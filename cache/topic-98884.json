Definitely recommend it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile in DC area maybe at least drive up on the grounds of Arlington House<br/>\n(called Custis-Lee Mansion from 1955 to 1972 - no wonder I still call it<br/>\nthat!), even if you don&#39;t take the house tour.

So he agreed to<br/>\nmove to Lexington to be President of then Washington College, now W&L<br/>\nUniversity.
