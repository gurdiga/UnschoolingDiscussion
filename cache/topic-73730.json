Going through a huge paradigm <br/>\nshift here, and that&#39;s scary. Feeling clueless and feeling like I <br/>\nreally messed up my oldest boy (23, &quot;victim&quot; of my cluelessness, <br/>\nimmaturity, harshness, what have you) But this list helps so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO MUCH to think about. SO MUCH inner work to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks again, Lee-Ann in Australia.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Lee-Ann, Heidi.  I am still starting out so I am often <br/>\nstill confused about things.  Today was one of those doubting days.  <br/>\nThose &quot;I am not doing enough with them&quot; days.  Although, I know they <br/>\nget alot of attention, I always worry they do not get enough &quot;great <br/>\nadult example to inspire them&quot; time.  I don&#39;t even know if that makes <br/>\nsense..LOL!  For me, it has not been as much of a paradigm shift in <br/>\n*discipline* or the manner of raising them.  Although there is <br/>\ncertainly alot of that too.   More of letting go of the teaching <br/>\nstuff and not worrying about the writing and reading.  <br/>\nCongratulations on your journey :)<br/>\n<br/>\nolga :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139549710,"authorName":"Olga","from":"&quot;Olga&quot; &lt;britcontoo@...&gt;","profile":"britcontoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Manners","postDate":"1055365562","msgId":73730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjODVqcStudWk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":73763,"prevInTime":73729,"nextInTime":73731,"topicId":73730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"jmcseals SEALS  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-506418936\">&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmcseals@...\">jmcseals@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I ask you to consider what your goal is in making a child <br/>\nacknowledge and <br/>\nthank a hostess for a meal but not needing an adult to do so.  <br/>\nPersonally, I <br/>\nwould be more shocked if an adult chose not to do so, rather than an <br/>\ninexperienced child.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer,<br/>\n<br/>\nI completely agree here.  If you expect kids to say excuse me, then <br/>\nMom & Dad should do that too.   You will never have to *teach* them, <br/>\nthey will do it on their own.  Also, bad manners are much more <br/>\nunforgivable from an adult than a child.  Kids who have bad manners <br/>\nwill usually have parents that are similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71508,"nextTopicId":73771}}
