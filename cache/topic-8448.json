I have a problem with the neighbor","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1523043583\">Hi all, <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question, I came to you all because many of you know how I feel <br/>\nabout the things I am going to talk about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a problem with the neighbor girl. My ds and dd are 10 and 9. The <br/>\nneighbor girl is 13 and public schooled. Now I know many very sweet ps teens <br/>\nso please don&#39;t think I am being purely prejudice. I feel like an ogre when I <br/>\nsay that I can&#39;t stand this girl. She is one of the most self centered people <br/>\nI have ever met, adult or child. Almost to the point of being sociopathic. I <br/>\nhave tried to keep my children and her fairly separate over the past three <br/>\nyears, simply because this girl welds the age thing over my children&#39;s heads <br/>\nso effectively. The power is not equal, you know what I mean? She is very <br/>\nmanipulative and talks incessantly about what her parents buy her, how much <br/>\nher clothes cost, how she has a horse, (which my dd in the middle of a horse <br/>\nphase would love to have.) and I feel it is breeding discontent, in my <br/>\ndaughter especially. We have chosen to live more deliberately. We have told <br/>\nour children many times why we live as we do, so that we can spend more time <br/>\ntogether, do more things together ect. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason my kids seem to hang on her every word. Which frustrates me <br/>\nto know end as I have tried to raise them outside the box. I am not an <br/>\nisolationist. I want my children to be exposed to a variety of ideas and <br/>\npeople. But I am worried about the influence the girl will have on my <br/>\ndaughter. They have plenty of friends but this girl is so close that it is <br/>\nhard. I am not especially welcoming to this child but she doesn&#39;t take the <br/>\nhint very well. I feel horrible..... she is just a child.... but really I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like this is good for my DD who seems to be easily influenced.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question. Do I just say enough is enough tell the neighbor lady <br/>\nsweetly that I feel her dughter is just too old to play with my daughter? <br/>\nWhich, of course, is going to create horrible neighborhood relations. I have <br/>\ntried just keeping the kids otherwise occupied when she is around but I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to feel like I can&#39;t even let my kids out to play!!!!! LOL This girls <br/>\nbest friend, across the street, will be moving away and summer is <br/>\ncoming.......I see conflict ahead. Any advice???? Any at all??? Even if it is <br/>\njust to tell me how horrible I am for having such a deep dislike for a <br/>\nchild??? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nTeri</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8447,"nextTopicId":8452}}
