A book <br/>\n&gt; list, a set of proposed field trips, an explanation<br/>\n&gt; of interest-led learning, <br/>\n&gt; some quotes from John Holt, a list of all the stuff<br/>\n&gt; in your house which can <br/>\n&gt; be used for science...

If there were no <br/>\n&gt; social workers, a lot of kids would be in tears and<br/>\n&gt; hospitals and morgues who <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you are neglecting or abusing kids AND<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling, when social workers <br/>\n&gt; show up they&#39;ll want to know about homeschooling. <br/>\n&gt; If your kids are happy, <br/>\n&gt; healthy, nobody has any reason to report you to a<br/>\n&gt; government egency, then you <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t meet any social workers.  I know of one family<br/>\n&gt; here who&#39;s had social <br/>\n&gt; workers repeatedly, but it&#39;s because the dad is way<br/>\n&gt; older than the wife and <br/>\n&gt; one of his grown daughters calls them and tells them<br/>\n&gt; stuff.  I know of one <br/>\n&gt; family who had social workers once, and I think it<br/>\n&gt; was a routine thing <br/>\n&gt; related to adoption (they have two of their own kids<br/>\n&gt; and three adopted from <br/>\n&gt; overseas).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If your family is intact and you don&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; crazed inlaws or spiteful <br/>\n&gt; relatives you&#39;re probably entirely safe.

That happens even <br/>\n&gt; when kids are in school, though, sometimes, that you<br/>\n&gt; have to talk to the kids <br/>\n&gt; about giving neighbors some peace, or you have to<br/>\n&gt; justify to their dad why <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re not in dance lessons or learning French<br/>\n&gt; cooking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What state are you in?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cory and Amy Nelson","from":"Cory and Amy Nelson &lt;amynelson3@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9dTgal2GXbvW54-Cu4mYY50asKGgv_q8mNpB4PUBnPn3dZxcR6uSHi-2Z_mkNr2XU_AVBJeQtoknPSxpH3MdIRfRyXeCrNBpc7me8f6cOb8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Meeting Government Standards","postDate":"975695493","msgId":14324,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2NEQ0QUE1LkE5NCVhbXluZWxzb24zQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdiLmNlNWJlMGIuMjc1OTQyZGFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14323,"nextInTopic":14325,"prevInTime":14323,"nextInTime":14325,"topicId":14314,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m up for a trip to Alaska ;).

(And some of THOSE <br/>\ndon&#39;t care! &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s not as if there are truant officers prowling the town <br/>\nas there might have been in 1935 (or might not have been; a few towns had <br/>\nthem and parents in ALL towns used them as a boogeyman).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What do you do about mandatory testing?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all states have testing requirements.  Some have options--testing at home <br/>\nwith a purchased test, or keeping a portfolio.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What about those who live in states where the law requires them <br/>\n to show what curriculum they are using and have to have it approved? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anyplace besides Pennsylvania which has this requirement?<br/>\nWhat you do if you&#39;re in Pennsylvania (or another such place if there is <br/>\none), is you find the local unschoolers and get their direct advice, look at <br/>\nthe packets they&#39;ve prepared which have been successfully approved.    A book <br/>\nlist, a set of proposed field trips, an explanation of interest-led learning, <br/>\nsome quotes from John Holt, a list of all the stuff in your house which can <br/>\nbe used for science...  I know people do it, and they do it with lists and <br/>\nwords, not with the name of a curriculum.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=- What about those nasty social workers that come to your house and demand <br/>\nto know what you are teaching your child and to prove that they are learning? <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial workers can be good in worst-of-all situations.  If there were no <br/>\nsocial workers, a lot of kids would be in tears and hospitals and morgues who <br/>\naren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are neglecting or abusing kids AND homeschooling, when social workers <br/>\nshow up they&#39;ll want to know about homeschooling.  If your kids are happy, <br/>\nhealthy, nobody has any reason to report you to a government egency, then you <br/>\nwon&#39;t meet any social workers.  I know of one family here who&#39;s had social <br/>\nworkers repeatedly, but it&#39;s because the dad is way older than the wife and <br/>\none of his grown daughters calls them and tells them stuff.  I know of one <br/>\nfamily who had social workers once, and I think it was a routine thing <br/>\nrelated to adoption (they have two of their own kids and three adopted from <br/>\noverseas).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your family is intact and you don&#39;t have any crazed inlaws or spiteful <br/>\nrelatives you&#39;re probably entirely safe.  If you have an ex husband (parent <br/>\nof the kids) or neighbors who REALLY wish your kids weren&#39;t making all that <br/>\nnoise (or that the&#39;d go to school for six hours so the neighbor could have a <br/>\nbreak), then those are the people you need to appease.  That happens even <br/>\nwhen kids are in school, though, sometimes, that you have to talk to the kids <br/>\nabout giving neighbors some peace, or you have to justify to their dad why <br/>\nthey&#39;re not in dance lessons or learning French cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat state are you in?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Roni Murphy","from":"&quot;Roni Murphy&quot; &lt;rsssjm@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"z4YX1VLQ0XMjyx5AfWbMFv-rgewGtXS9IxtznOiCIuPJO43bRwwwiBQfUf_PuHwivFwGJUGsofJTik8C79q-YzOOYu7X3WlCqXpl","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Meeting Government Standards","postDate":"975676058","msgId":14314,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMjAwMDEyNTExMzczODIwMEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14315,"prevInTime":14313,"nextInTime":14315,"topicId":14314,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I am very interested in Unschooling.
