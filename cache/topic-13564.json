The landed gentry who oversaw the area (and usually had the church on their land) would be present for the ceremony. This developed into a holiday in which the lord and lady of the manor would hand out presents to the servants.<br>\n<br>\nSue H. <br>\nWho has a mind for trivia but can never remember where her car keys are. <br>\n<br>\nOh, just checked . . .<br>\nThis from the World Book Encyclopedia:<br>\n<font SIZE=\"5\"><font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Boxing Day is a holiday celebrated in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. It falls on December 26, which is also St. Stephen&#39;s Day. The public observance of Boxing Day takes place on the following Monday if December 26 falls on a Saturday or Sunday. The traditional celebration of Boxing Day included giving money and other gifts to charitable institutions, needy individuals, and people in service jobs. The holiday may date from the Middle Ages (A.D. 400&#39;s--1500&#39;s), but the exact origin is unknown. It may have begun with the lords and ladies of England, who presented Christmas gifts in boxes to their servants on December 26. Or it may have begun with priests, who opened the church&#39;s alms (charity) boxes on the day after Christmas and distributed the contents to the poor. </font></font>\n \n</html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"benliam@aol.com","from":"benliam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"k_I1g7lgSEMapDiuZ6UqVVjJqcR7l3X5IOcVkuJ6fvlGZllddxupB_m0pO7985LxIwldRjJ6","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 812","postDate":"970355335","msgId":13566,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwLmFmYmY0NWUuMjcwN2NjODdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13565,"nextInTopic":13585,"prevInTime":13565,"nextInTime":13567,"topicId":13564,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/28/00 7:57:46 AM Eastern Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2077164260\">In a message dated 9/28/00 7:57:46 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Boxing Day, popular term applied to December 26 in England, Wales, parts <br/>\nof Canada, and in some other countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. <br/>\nTraditionally, on that day the gentry would give presents, generally of <br/>\nmoney, to servants, tradespeople, and others of humble life.
