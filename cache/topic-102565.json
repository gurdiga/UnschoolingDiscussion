Cats didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave any problem at all adjusting. And no the thing won&#39;t start with a cat<br/>\ninside. In fact just the other day was the first time I saw it stop when it<br/>\ndetected something still inside. It was me putting in more litter but the<br/>\nsensors picked it up and stopped right away. I would never use anything else<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102501,"nextTopicId":102575}}
