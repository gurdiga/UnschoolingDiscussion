I<br/>\ncall it &quot;unchoring.&quot; ;-)  I despise housework, so here<br/>\nis what we do:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Every night before bedtime we clean up.  That just<br/>\nmeans picking up the stuff we took out during the day,<br/>\nmaking sure all the laundry is in the laundry basket,<br/>\ndishes in the sink, etc.  My 6yo is good about helping<br/>\nme with this, and the 4yo is coming along (it&#39;s her<br/>\nbedtime, so she can be a bit grouchy).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I do dishes three times a week (it&#39;s just the three<br/>\nof us, and we&#39;re all little and don&#39;t eat much! <br/>\nhehe).  When I do dishes I have them run around and<br/>\ncheck for any we might have missed.  I have them<br/>\nconvinced that this is a fun game.  (My mom did the<br/>\nsame thing with me when I was little.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Laundry is another nightmare task so I do it once<br/>\nor twice a week.  The kids help by putting their dirty<br/>\nclothes in the laundry baskets after they take them<br/>\noff.  I saw someone (maybe on this list) say that they<br/>\nhad their seven year old do their own laundry.  My 6.5<br/>\nyear old can&#39;t reach the washing machine controls so<br/>\nthat is pretty much out.  Besides, the washer and<br/>\ndryer are in the basement and there are spiders down<br/>\nthere (yuck).<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Dusting and polishing?  What&#39;s that?<br/>\n<br/>\n5. My kids love to help with cooking and yard work, so<br/>\nno problem there.  Basically wherever they want to<br/>\npitch in I let them, and they are gradually getting<br/>\nthe idea that less chores for mommy = more mommy time<br/>\nfor them.  This idea forms the basis of our lazy<br/>\nunchoring philosphy.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Thinking about life, by the time you get old enough to understand what it&#39;s all about, you die.&quot;  -- Ozzy Osbourne<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109478136,"authorName":"tamlvee","from":"&quot;tamlvee&quot; &lt;stvan3@...&gt;","profile":"tamlvee","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"home caring","postDate":"1025023524","msgId":38624,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFmYTZuNCtjMGowQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38651,"prevInTime":38623,"nextInTime":38625,"topicId":38624,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Reading these posts about children having responsibility around the house has been interesting to read, as well as slightly amusing.

I <br/>\nspent a lot of time &quot;wishing&quot; my family were more neat.  Then I had a <br/>\nrevelation, I&#39;m not neat!  Then I thought why should I expect them to <br/>\nbe.  My bedroom is a mess.  Do I &quot;wish&quot; it was clean and orderly?  <br/>\nYes!  Will I clean it?  When I can&#39;t stand it anymore I will.  So I <br/>\nput no pressure on my children to clean their rooms.  The common <br/>\nareas are different though.  But we work together to keep these <br/>\nclean. This is everyones responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the mantra I encourage over and over.  It comes from the <br/>\nSimple Abundance Book, by Sarah Ban Breathnach.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you take it out, put it back.<br/>\n  If you open it, close it.<br/>\n  If you throw it down, pick it up.<br/>\n  If you take it off, hang it up (in our house no one hangs anything <br/>\nup so I have adjusted this one to, put it in the drawer, in the <br/>\nhamper or throw it down the stairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo these things happen daily at our house? No.  Do I expect them to?  <br/>\nLet&#39;s say I start everyday hopeful.  I do encourage one thing to be <br/>\nput away before getting something else out.  We all know that team <br/>\nclean up is easier if this advice is followed, but it doesn&#39;t always <br/>\nhappen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned to be more relaxed about these things since we started <br/>\nhomeschooling.  It&#39;s my wasted energy to stress about house cleaning, <br/>\nno one else worries about it, and when it need to get done it gets <br/>\ndone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents:)<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38639,"nextTopicId":38647}}
