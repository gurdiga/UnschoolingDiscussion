An unschooled child is free to choose the what,<br/>\nwhen, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to<br/>\nSpongebob Squarepants!

Everyone with an interest in<br/>\nunschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>\nmind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>\ndesigned to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>\nunschooling.
