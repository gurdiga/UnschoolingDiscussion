The pace picks up <br/>\nquite a bit. So, in your son&#39;s case, it&#39;s probably safe to say that <br/>\nhe&#39;s been able to cover up his inability to comprehend for quite some <br/>\ntime.  Now that there&#39;s this diagnosis, he&#39;s bound to be upset.  <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s angry/frustrated that he struggled for so long and nobody <br/>\never realized it or figured it out. Maybe he&#39;s gotten into more <br/>\ndetailed material so that covering up is now impossible and he&#39;s <br/>\nfeeling defeated.  (I don&#39;t know... just making assumptions based on <br/>\nmy friend&#39;s son who also had the same problem).  In my friend&#39;s case, <br/>\nher son began taking a medication (don&#39;t know which one but it was <br/>\nakin to a mild sedative) and within three weeks, he experienced <br/>\npositive results. Further, more detailed diagnosis was done and it <br/>\nwas determined that he could do the work when not put under the <br/>\nnormal time constraints.  *Maybe* by being at home your son will <br/>\nlearn to relax without the medication (that is probably a bad choice <br/>\nof wording)... I&#39;m trying to say that your son may not need <br/>\nmedications (then again, he may) but at least try <br/>\nunschooling/deschooling before drugs. There are side effects and <br/>\nconcequences to the drug route and you may very well be able to avoid <br/>\nthat if given time.<br/>\n~xx~ ~xx~ ~xx~<br/>\nSarah Carothers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, 28 Dec 2001 03:50:56 -0800 (PST), debbie jones wrote:<br/>\n&gt;His problem is in<br/>\n&gt;comprehension.

It is so","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1635454378\">Thank you very much Dar and Kolleen! I&#39;m sorry but the name of the book I&#39;m reading is The Liberation Handbook. I probably confused you earlier. It is so SENSIBLE.<br/>\nI have spoken to my son. I know exactly what he wants to do and has for years, computer programming. I told him today that I&#39;m leaving him in charge of what he wants to do, and he chose another programming course. He has always taken academics very seriously and the last two years in ps left him feeling very inadequate and not knowing why. He read a book called The End of Homework about a year ago and told me to also. I did. He then asked me to let him homeschool. He told me that he just did a lot of busy work at school and couldn&#39;t see why he needed to do stuff he already knew. I chuckled at first, but I&#39;ve always admired him for seeing the big picture and always made so much sense. Since we found that he had trouble with focusing and was inconsistent in his math, forgetful and always was, etc. we had him tested and diagnosed with ADD. I wonder about these labels too, and it doesn&#39;t exactly make him feel much better, but he says if they can give him something to take care of the concentration problem, fine. I have always seen him as a very intuitive, bright boy and we have always had a very good, open relationship. He feels he can talk to me and does, so I feel quite lucky.<br/>\nWe have found a hs group just recently, and my younger son, 12, is enjoying it, but there are no real teens my 14yo son&#39;s age. I think if he found other boys who don&#39;t attent ps, it would be good for him. He&#39;s quite mature for his age so 12yo&#39;s may be on a different level than what he would choose. I am going to continue to work to find other kids his age and take care of his lonliness he says he has. I honestly think this has been a big adjustment for him and he doesn&#39;t feel right about not attenting ps. Hopefully, time will change that.<br/>\nI will have to get those Holt books, as I&#39;ve been meaning to for quite some time. Homeschooling should be more relaxed than it has been so far, worrying about if we covered this, covered that. In MA, we have to be able to show documentation such as progress reports at the end of each year and I don&#39;t know how to do that if we unschool. <br/>\nThank you again very much. I am starting to see the light finally.  <br/>\nDebbie<br/>\n    Kolleen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kolleen@...\">Kolleen@...</a>&gt; wrote: &gt;dljones0 writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What I would love is encouragement, advice on unschooling, and please <br/>\n&gt;no ridiculing because it&#39;s not as easy for me to just jump in like <br/>\n&gt;some of the rest of you who have done it for so long. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>[snip]<br/>\n<br/>\ndebbie, I sure hope that the advice on this list doesn&#39;t sound <br/>\nridiculing. this is a great place to get encouragement, just keep posting <br/>\nyour concerns and your fears. sometimes, buttons are pressed, but its not <br/>\ndone with malice.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, please explain where I go from here.

I ask because my 14 yo son doesn&#39;t appear to read at all, but I <br/>\nfinally realized how much he&#39;s actually reading in his bike magazines and <br/>\non the web.  He won&#39;t read fiction because he can&#39;t read fast enough to <br/>\nreally get what he&#39;s reading, but the non-fiction stuff within his <br/>\ninterests is doable for him.  Maybe you need to really look at what he does <br/>\nread, or maybe offer him reading material according to his <br/>\ninterests.

Keep reading - here, unschooling.com, Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books, John<br/>\nHolt&#39;s books. Immerse yourself in unschooling, so that it starts to seem<br/>\nnatural - it is natural, but people have been telling you your whole life<br/>\nthat it won&#39;t work, that you must force academics or kids won&#39;t learn<br/>\nanything. You know in your heart that that&#39;s not true, but you worry...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you find youself worrying about your son not doing &quot;academics&quot;,<br/>\nstop, take a breath, and read some more Holt. Try not to pass your<br/>\nanxieties on to your son - he&#39;s probably got enough of them after<br/>\nspending so long in the system. Tell him that we think he&#39;s doing fine,<br/>\nand whatever he chooses to do is right for him. He can&#39;t fail anymore,<br/>\nthere is no failure here. <br/>\n<br/>\nInvite him to try some stuff out. Read the paper, bring up some of the<br/>\nthings you find - maybe spelunking, an improv group, a museum showing.<br/>\nTalk about your passions - if you can&#39;t think of any, develop some.<br/>\nNurturing your own passions is important, you&#39;re modeling this for your<br/>\nson. Ariel Gore once said, &quot;Children deserve interesting parents.&quot; Do<br/>\nyour &quot;thing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, when I worry, I remind myself that a 14 yr old can learn K-8<br/>\nmath in 6 weeks without too much trouble. &quot;Academics&quot; don&#39;t take anywhere<br/>\nnear as long as the schools spend on them. I think of an unschooled 11 yr<br/>\nold I know, who had done pretty much nothing at all academic and had<br/>\nactually just learned to read the year before. He ended up having to go<br/>\nto school for 5th grade - long story, but he spend 3 months working with<br/>\na tutor and then entered 5th grade and did great. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son says he wants to read but find it difficult now, maybe he<br/>\nneeds new things to read. How about Mad magazine, Calvin and Hobbes,<br/>\nLarry Gonick&#39;s History of the Universe?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you joined a support group? Is it the right one? I&#39;ve noticed that a<br/>\nlot of the younger kids seem to look up to pre-teen and teen boys in some<br/>\nof the groups we&#39;ve joined. Maybe it would help him to interact with kids<br/>\nwho have never been to school, and maybe slightly younger kids would be<br/>\nless intimidating than kids his age. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas,<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
