She started her own list as you already know. There is really no point in dragging up old arguments. We&#39;re trying to get a fresh start here and make this list a pleasant place to dissect the issues of unschooling. We can pick apart the issues, disagree with one another but I, for one, would really like to see this ugliness cease. Plenty of people had something to say about labeling and diagnosing kids with reading problems. Nobody stooped to calling me ugly names (thank you &lt;g&gt;) yet everybody got to bring their POV to the table.  <br/>\nWhich brings us to this point. You stated your way of dealing with words in your family. Others wrote in in opposition and you rebutted. End of thread *unless* you feel you were misquoted or misunderstood and then, by all means, I&#39;d hope you&#39;d try to clarify. <br/>\nPlease... I need a place where we can toss things out for discussion and debate and I&#39;d imagine others are here for the same reason. If a thread stirs up so much anger, can the parties involved take it off list or just drop it?<br/>\n.. not trying to be a list-police... just wishing we could all hang out under the same roof in peace<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: rumpleteasermom <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, December 05, 2001 12:58 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Perceptions WAS Digest Number 1656<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  You know, I was going to let this go but then I had a thought and it <br/>\n  is nagging away . . . <br/>\n<br/>\n  How is it that telling me I sound condescending and patronizing is <br/>\n  okay and just a comment on my posts but when I said Sandra was coming <br/>\n  across in very negative way that was a personal insult to Sandra?<br/>\n<br/>\n  You really can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Ah, but this is the crux of the matter.

In my opinion, as an <br/>\nunschooler, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to protect my boys from every <br/>\nsingle hurtful person they come across.  Unfortunately, unfairness and <br/>\nrudeness is something we can not protect them from all of the time.  But <br/>\nwe can try.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with TRYING for perfection.  Even <br/>\nthough we try, they will still be exposed to unpleasant situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a need for us as parents to describe them in <br/>\nnegative terms (in their presence, or not in their presence) just so <br/>\nthey can be prepared to enter the &quot;real&quot; world.  I happen to think my <br/>\nboys are already in the real world and they are exposed to many good <br/>\nthings, a well as bad.  I also know that should my boys encounter a <br/>\nsituation in the future (as an adult) that they have not yet <br/>\nexperienced, they will be able to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never called my boys &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;willful&quot; and I hope I never do.  <br/>\nI believe that would be very hurtful and it would affect them in a very <br/>\nnegative way.  It would make them feel less about themselves and demean <br/>\nthem and that would be contrary to the philosophy of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who knows me will agree that I am VERY far from perfect, but that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I shouldn&#39;t keep trying.  I am definitely guilty for <br/>\nmodeling rude and poor behaviour to my kids.  And, my husband uses some <br/>\npretty foul language at times.  Of course, my boys have learned some of <br/>\nthese things, and I don&#39;t like it much, but this is just the reality of <br/>\nour particular family.  They have learned plenty from our mistakes and <br/>\nthey are and will be prepared for the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are plenty of people on this list who have a much more <br/>\nrelaxed family than we do, but even they can not protect their children <br/>\nfrom everything.  So, there is no need for us to consciously label our <br/>\nchildren for their own good.  Anyway, as unschoolers, aren&#39;t we supposed <br/>\nto respect our childrens&#39; choices and if they want to do nothing then <br/>\nallow them to do nothing.  That is their choice.  They should not be <br/>\ncalled &quot;lazy&quot;.

I think my reading push was particularly bad for Lars <br/>\nbecause of all the phone counselling I had done over the years.  He had <br/>\nheard me tell other people time and again that their kids would read when <br/>\nthey were ready, that forced reading causes problems, that we can trust our <br/>\nkids to learn what they need to know.  I really believed it, and yet, I <br/>\nstill panicked.  I&#39;m sure Lars must have felt really ripped off about <br/>\nit.  (Yes, I have apologized.)  It was the dyslexia idea that got to <br/>\nme.  What if he had a problem that was preventing his learning to read, and <br/>\nI never did anything to help him with it?  I just carried it too far, <br/>\ninsisting rather than offering help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I did finally write out a song that she<br/>\n&gt;and her 6yo sister know.

I got so focused for a while on what Lars <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do, that I forgot to pay enough attention to what he could <br/>\ndo.  Since I&#39;ve been doing that, his self-esteem has jumped.  It&#39;s also <br/>\ngood that you are aware of what each of your kids is good at.  I assume you <br/>\npoint it out to them as well (or to other people when the kids are <br/>\nlistening.)  I was concerned that my granddaughter (just turning 7) would <br/>\nread before Lars.  Since they are so close in age, and Skye is here a lot, <br/>\nthey tend to act more like siblings than uncle and niece.  He&#39;s still ahead <br/>\nof her in reading, but she&#39;s really keen to be able to do it.  And she does <br/>\ntend to be competitive with him.    For a while she seemed ready to copy <br/>\nhim in everything else, like sports and stuff.  Now she&#39;s moving into the <br/>\nthings she really loves, like drama and dance and music.
