Usually around 6pm he takes a fun bath and splashes and plays until I am soaked and the floor is soaked. lol When he is finished, I get him dryed off and into a comfy cloth diaper and his soft jammies. He then cuddles up to nurse while I read him a story. Usually within about 20 minutes he is out cold. He will then sleep until about midnight when he wakes to nurse again. (He still gets up 3 or 4 times a night to nurse) <br/>\n My other three sons pretty much go to bed when they are ready too. Logan usually stays up pretty late, other than work nights. He has held down a job for about 9 months now and knows that if he stays up late he is no good for work the next day. Andrew is usually out around 11pm unless he is engrossed in a book or a movie. Alexander, like clockwork is out cold by 10pm. His favorite place to sleep is on the livingroom couch. lol <br/>\n <br/>\nKathy Sullivan:<br/>\nMom to Logan 15, Andrew 10, Alexander 6 1/2, and Christopher David 14 months.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.babiesonline.com/babies/c/christopherdavid/\">http://www.babiesonline.com/babies/c/christopherdavid/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some people think that we put our lives on hold to raise a child, but we know that to hold a child IS life&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To be free to learn, children must be free to dream!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69528565,"authorName":"Tammie Thomas","from":"Tammie Thomas &lt;soulfulconnections@...&gt;","profile":"soulfulconnections","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] bed time ritual","postDate":"1039661299","msgId":51277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMjEyMDI0ODE5LjMxNDUxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMzk2NDEyMDQuMjg5MS42NjkwNy5tNEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51284,"prevInTime":51276,"nextInTime":51278,"topicId":51277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our bed time ritual is pretty basic.
