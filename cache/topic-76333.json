The music department wanted to be sure they had us before<br/>\nthey forked out the money.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; How sad for the kids, at 17 or 18, to be fored to declare before they could<br/>\n&gt; check out the things they had never heard of.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was possible to not declare a major, but it made it harder to get any<br/>\ncourses you really wanted to take.  Smart people with no monetary<br/>\nobligations changed majors every semester or year -- that way they got<br/>\npriority for the handful of classes they wanted, and in the end, they<br/>\ndeclared a General Studies major or something and got a degree.

But that&#39;s why my BA is in music -- if I had changed<br/>\nmajors, I would have lost my scholarship.  That was the difficult part of<br/>\nthe decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76306,"nextTopicId":76318}}
