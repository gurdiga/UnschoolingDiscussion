So I bought one and signed him up for Suzuki, in which the mom <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; child supposedly learn together. Well, the first assignment was to build a <br/>\n&gt; toy violin, from a box covered in brown shopping-bag paper and strings drawn <br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt; with red magic marker. One end had a paint paddle attached to be the &quot;neck.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;        No sound to worry about sounding bad at least! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;        The idea was that little children really need to be able to make <br/>\n&gt; mistakes, to be rough, to fumble and drop it, whatever. The first task is to <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ingrain the standing still, the standing straight, the tucking under the <br/>\n&gt; chin at the <br/>\n&gt; right spot, the lifting and lowering and repositioning, et cetera, ad <br/>\n&gt; nauseum. Not making actual sound.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;        I don&#39;t mean to misrepresent the method or diss violin playing -- it <br/>\n&gt; did not work for us, obviously, probably for were many reasons other than <br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; and that wouldn&#39;t apply to your situation anyway. My only real point is that <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; when this method DOES work, it all starts by building and handling your own <br/>\n&gt; toy <br/>\n&gt; violin and then not playing at all. If you can get anything helpful out of <br/>\n&gt; this, more power to you! &lt;gg&gt;  JJ<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       Duh!  It just occurred to me that we have a professional violinist mom <br/>\nin our local hs group. She is not quite unschooling as I understand it -- <br/>\nthough she is moving in that direction with her four young ones -- but she is <br/>\nvery thoughtful and good-hearted, and recently started an hs symphony. Would you <br/>\nlike me to put this question to her  and see what she advises for your dd?
