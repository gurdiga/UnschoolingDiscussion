The word is in his head all by itself, like a little <br/>\nsteaming pile.<br/>\nBut if he watched the cartoons and that word came up maybe once in 10,000 <br/>\nwords and it was in context and funny and he had all the other input, art, <br/>\nparody, music, word play, that would make SO many things accessible to him.  Ideas <br/>\nand connections galore, and just lighthearted humor and relaxing laughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no.  <br/>\nAnd these aren&#39;t religious people, just uptight parents who think controls <br/>\nare the same as good parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave a copy of the Eddie Izzard DVD &quot;Dress to Kill&quot; to a family I know and <br/>\nthey won&#39;t play it where their teenagers are because he says &quot;fuck.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell again, they&#39;ve &quot;saved&quot; them from exposure to a word they already know, <br/>\nand also protected them from some crazed but brilliant stories on WWII, Star <br/>\nWars, French language and culture, the history of the Church of England, <br/>\nNapoleon, Hitler...<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t worry about my kids and they keep on amazing me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93062,"nextTopicId":93076}}
