Why would they like them?  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t stand coffee. Can&#39;t stand the smell or color of it. Makes me gag. <br/>\nLiterally. Same for tira mi su, cappucino desserts, and anything &quot;mocca&quot;!  I <br/>\nflatly refuse to drink milk. Can&#39;t stand the smell or texture or taste. When <br/>\nI rarely eat cereal, it&#39;s dry.<br/>\nEggs. &lt;shivers&gt; Don&#39;t get me started!<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly, my husband will have the occasional expresso or cappucino when we dine <br/>\nout (but I refuse to kiss him afterwards), and my six year old LOVES coffee <br/>\n(again, NO kissing!). I don&#39;t even want them breathing in my general <br/>\ndirection! All three men-in-my-life will drink a glass of milk with sweets <br/>\n(yech!) or with tortilla chips (!) and on cereal. We go through 1.5 gallons <br/>\nof milk/week. I don&#39;t drink a drop. All three are egg-crazy. Fried, <br/>\nscrambled, boiled, poached, omeletted, you name it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would I deny them these things because I hate them?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Does this make since?  I&#39;d really like to know if someone feels this is<br/>\nnot an unschooling approach and why.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to me. Do they get to choose, or have you already made the choice FOR <br/>\nthem?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkellyinsc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44106,"nextTopicId":43683}}
