The eldest<br/>\ndaughter turned to her mother and smirked and said something<br/>\nsuggesting that the action had been predicted prior to our arrival. <br/>\nOf course, when they come to our house not only do they play our<br/>\ncomputer games outside the &quot;educational&quot; market and those within it,<br/>\nbut they play on the gamecube and watch videos ad libitum and eat<br/>\nthings that are not on offer at their house. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, as Simon and Linnaea like the family, the parents have<br/>\ndecided that we are not appropriate to mix with. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;beanmommy2&quot;<br/>\n&lt;beanmommy2@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;*********************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It made me wonder, if a kid feels that way, would it almost be <br/>\n&gt; better for them to just go to regular school?

I know several home schooling families <br/>\nwho have very different styles than we do.  Even though they would be <br/>\nconsidered much more structured or &#39;schoolish&#39;, their kids still get <br/>\nway more free time and their learning is still more directed to their <br/>\ninterests than it would be in school.  Now in a couple of rare cases, <br/>\nthe mom was such a huge control freak, and the kids&#39; lives were so <br/>\nnarrow, that yes, I do think they would have been happier in school.  <br/>\nTypically, this is your very rigid extreme.  The last mom I met that <br/>\nwas like this, had determined that each of their children MUST go to <br/>\ncollege, that was the only path to &#39;sucess&#39; as far as she was <br/>\nconcerned.  Since they were rather poor, she determined that they <br/>\nneeded high ACT scores in order to get a scholarship, so she <br/>\nbasically drilled her kids in everything she thought they would need <br/>\nfor a high score...very sad.  The first two kids did indeed do well <br/>\nand get scholarships, but the third one, no matter how hard she tried <br/>\njust couldn&#39;t test well.  That poor little girl really felt like she <br/>\nwas letting her family down.  Happily most moms I know do some <br/>\nschoolish stuff for a couple of hours a day, but then the kid is <br/>\nfree.  I think those kids still seem quite happy.  Probably they <br/>\nwould be happier if they were able to unschool, but still better off <br/>\nthan being glued to a seat for 6 hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92710795,"authorName":"InnerLight Academy","from":"InnerLight Academy &lt;innerlightacademy@...&gt;","profile":"innerlightacademy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Is school-at-home worse than school at doughnut shop?","postDate":"1125264273","msgId":108035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwODI4MjEyNDMzLjkxODYyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjM0MzEzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRldDFqZCt1ZTJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":108031,"nextInTopic":108039,"prevInTime":108034,"nextInTime":108036,"topicId":108031,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We went on a field trip with a mixing  of different cover schools(Alabama).
