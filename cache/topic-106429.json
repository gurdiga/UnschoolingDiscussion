","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1849103100\">Heads up!  A free education opportunity awaits you this August.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Red Planet is about to be spectacular!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis month  and next, Earth is catching up with Mars in an encounter that <br/>\nwill culminate  in the closest approach between the two planets in recorded <br/>\nhistory. The  next time Mars may come this close is in 2287. Due to the way <br/>\nJupiter&#39;s  gravity tugs on Mars and perturbs its orbit, astronomers can <br/>\nonly be certain  that Mars has not come this close to Earth in the Last <br/>\n5,000 years, but it  may be as long as 60,000 years before it happens again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe encounter  will culminate on August 27th when Mars comes to within <br/>\n34,649,589 miles of  Earth and will be (next to the moon) the brightest <br/>\nobject in the night sky.  It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will <br/>\nappear 25.11 arc seconds wide.  At a modest 75-power magnification<br/>\n<br/>\nMars will look as large as the full  moon to the naked eye. Mars will be <br/>\neasy to spot. At the beginning of August  it will rise in the east at <br/>\n10p.m. and reach its azimuth at about 3  a.m.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the end of August when the two planets are closest, Mars will  rise at <br/>\nnightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at 12:30a.m. <br/>\nThat&#39;s  pretty convenient to see something that no human being has seen in <br/>\nrecorded history. So, mark your calendar at the beginning of August to see <br/>\nMars grow progressively brighter and brighter throughout the  month.<br/>\n<br/>\nShare this with your children and grandchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************************************************<br/>\nNO ONE ALIVE TODAY WILL EVER SEE THIS AGAIN!<br/>\n*************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to hit up Wal-Mart for those telescopes they carry in stock; or try <br/>\none of these catalog houses:<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.meade.com\">http://www.meade.com</a> - Meade Telescope brand home page<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.telescope.com\">http://www.telescope.com</a> - Orion Telescope brand home page<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.telescopes.com\">http://www.telescopes.com</a> - multi-brand dealer<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.astronomics.com\">http://www.astronomics.com</a> - Meade dealer<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scientificsonline.com/Default.asp?bhcd2=1117810187\">http://www.scientificsonline.com/Default.asp?bhcd2=1117810187</a><br/>\n\t\t- Scientific hobby supply house; also carries<br/>\n\t\ttelescopes.
