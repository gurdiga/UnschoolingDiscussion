You have a right to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-449485561\">Holly,<br/>\n<br/>\nSet boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have very difficult in-laws. The stories are many, but the point is: <br/>\nset boundaries. You have a right to say &quot;no&quot;. You have a right to <br/>\nprotect your child. If you can&#39;t trust her around your child, simply do <br/>\nnot allow this to happen. Your child needs to be able to trust you, and <br/>\nyour first priority is your child, and yourself, not your sibling. <br/>\nPeople who constantly overstep boundaries are used to getting their own <br/>\nway, and are, on the whole, very self-centered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don&#39;t explain. You don&#39;t owe her an explanation for &quot;no&quot;. ex.: No, <br/>\ntoday isn&#39;t a good day for a visit. (why?) It isn&#39;t a good day. We have <br/>\nother plans. -- be firm, refuse to explain. Keep saying no. Your plans <br/>\nmay be to have a quiet day at home. You don&#39;t need to justify to her. <br/>\nShe isn&#39;t in charge of you. Set boundaries. Don&#39;t allow situations where <br/>\nyour child is alone w/ an adult who treats her badly. Period. My fil has <br/>\nleft my oldest in tears before w/ his condescending attitude, criticism, <br/>\netc. We simply make sure that she is not alone with him anymore, not <br/>\nsitting next to him, etc. If he goes too far (as he always does - the <br/>\nman is so supremely self-centered that he is only capable of seeing one <br/>\npov - his.) I have more than once had to step in, answer a question. <br/>\nGenerally, I&#39;ll send my daughter off somewhere (ex. go see what <br/>\ndad/brother/somebody is doing. or could you get me such-and-such.) I <br/>\ndon&#39;t fight, I deflect. I don&#39;t confront, I essentially ignore.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, simple boundaries, firm answers, refusal to argue or explain <br/>\nworks. Sometimes, the behavior can be so outrageous, you have to take a <br/>\nstand. But most of the time, firm, non-defensive works fine. Also, <br/>\nthere&#39;s no reason to allow your daughter to be alone w/ relatives who <br/>\ntreat her badly. If they treat her badly in your home, then meet them <br/>\nelsewhere. You *don&#39;t* have to allow them free and unsupervised access <br/>\nto your home and your life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when the behavior doesn&#39;t improve, adjust accordingly. ex., in-laws <br/>\nkept showing up at odd times and letting themselves in, even when we <br/>\nwere home. I could hear them knocking gently *as* they were putting the <br/>\nkey in the lock (&quot;we knocked, but you didn&#39;t answer the door.&quot; bs.) We <br/>\nmoved shortly after that, and fil was furious when I wouldn&#39;t allow him <br/>\nto have a key to our new home. He badgered hubby for months, but I <br/>\ninsisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and give your kids permission to set boundaries, and to tell you <br/>\nwhen someone else doesn&#39;t respect them.  Simply being an adult relative <br/>\ndoes *not* give someone the right to insult, demean, or bully a child. <br/>\nAlso, tell your daughter it is okay to speak up. ex. &quot;I&#39;m allowed to <br/>\npick the mint.&quot; So many of us grew up with the attitude that children <br/>\nnever, ever challenged an adult, even when the adult was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a confrontational person by any means, but I had a choice of <br/>\nlearning to set boundaries or letting my in-laws run amok in my life. I <br/>\nchose to learn to set boundaries, and although I will never have <br/>\nanything more than a civil relationship w/ in-laws (because they <br/>\ncontinue to try and be rude, controlling, and disrespectful of <br/>\neveryone), I have learned how to keep them from harming my family. If <br/>\nyou want to chat, just holler. been there, done that, still dealing w/ <br/>\nall of it. (I&#39;ve got tons of war stories, if you want to hear them <br/>\n&lt;vbg&gt;. Honestly, I could write a sitcom. Some of it is absolutely <br/>\nunbelievable.)<br/>\n<br/>\nhth,<br/>\ngood luck - I know how hard it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sunday, September 28, 2003, at 08:28  AM, Holly Shaltz wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How can you refuse someone when a) she hasn&#39;t been definite that she<br/>\n&gt; wants to come and b) she will stay in a hotel?
