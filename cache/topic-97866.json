Tonight she took two playschool <br/>\npeople and tried (successfully) to fit both of them in one hand. I guess <br/>\nshe got my long fingers! She would hold them for a moment then she would <br/>\nallow first one then the other to drop into the tub and watch them float <br/>\naround. After a few seconds, she would pick them both up again and pass <br/>\nthe one in her left hand to join the one in her right. Then 1, 2, they <br/>\ngot dropped in again and she watched them float around some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was almost like she was thinking, &quot;Okay, they floated this time when <br/>\nI dropped them, but will they float next time?&quot; She did this over and <br/>\nover, maybe 8 or 9 times, as if to say, &quot;They floated the first two <br/>\ntimes, but will they float every single time?&quot; Very cool for me to watch <br/>\nand very thought provoking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is it that we understand so clearly when they are this age (14 <br/>\nmonths) that they are learning just from &quot;hanging out&quot; in the bath tub, <br/>\nbut suddenly at age 6 we have to hand them over to someone else so that <br/>\nthey can continue to learn through lectures, worksheets, texbooks, <br/>\nhomework, tests?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course learning is not the reason for putting her in the tub. It&#39;s <br/>\njust a happy side effect. I put her in there because we had gone to the <br/>\nLouisa agricultural fair and she had muddy knees. The fair was also <br/>\neducational but again, not the reason why we went. We went to pet goats <br/>\nand eat funnel cake, among other things. She just happened to learn that <br/>\na cow&#39;s moo is quite loud when you are standing right next to it. That <br/>\nbunnies are soft. That music comes from people with instruments, not <br/>\njust from stereo speakers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat funnel cake is good, but the lemonade that you were enjoying just a <br/>\nminute ago has suddenly become too sour. That it&#39;s scary to reach out to <br/>\npet a goat from the front where the eyes and teeth are, but it&#39;s not <br/>\nscary to pet a goat from the side. That mud is slippery. That pig <br/>\ndoo-doo smells really bad. That when your short legs get tired of <br/>\nwalking all you have to do is say &quot;Uppa&quot; and mama or grandma will <br/>\noblige, every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just like when she gets older and we bake pies and cookies <br/>\ntogether.
