I really want to feel like I don&#39;t have <br/>\nto justify my choices to anyone, maybe with time I will be able to gain that <br/>\nconfidence.  I know what is most important is my child and his desire to <br/>\nlearn.  I don&#39;t want to mess that up with forcing anything.  My friend whose <br/>\nson I mentioned read at 5 and is breezing through the Harry Potter books.  He <br/>\ndid however make a comment that second grade is hard and when his Mom <br/>\nquestioned him about why he thought that (maybe hoping to be able to help him <br/>\nwith a particular struggle) he simply commented that is wasn&#39;t fun.  I think <br/>\nprior to this he enjoyed school.  Now I wonder if since the fun of learning <br/>\nis no longer there, will he continue to be the advanced student that he has <br/>\nalways been.  The way we do things now, my son really seems to love learning <br/>\nand is naturally curious about a lot of things.  I really want to do all I <br/>\ncan to keep it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Debra Caruso","from":"Debra Caruso &lt;freespiritwolf@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"M61pQL3ZKdhBUPtiVtDwvGqYj7B_4WQH3BuUg9XUpTNlfN2SUwWat5PLyacjwHMfmPBx6reAj88VPokpI2chQDl8kztpubfZTUTXd_RXi6tO","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [[Unschooling-dotcom] Re: late readers]","postDate":"972310074","msgId":13746,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAxMDIzMTQwNzU0LjExNDU5LnFtYWlsQHd3dzB1Lm5ldGFkZHJlc3MudXNhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13752,"prevInTime":13745,"nextInTime":13747,"topicId":13746,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would also like to add my thoughts here.I have 4 sons.3 are grown now.I am a voracious reader,and have always read to and exposed my sons to tons of books of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-904547151\"><br>\n&quot; In the midst of winter,I found within me an invincible summer&quot; Albert Camus\nIcq number  87168064\nWe are courageous,we are brave,we are the survivors......deb<br>\n<br>\n<hr noshade width=\"90%\">\nGet your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.netscape.com/webmail\">http://home.netscape.com/webmail</a>.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13751,"nextTopicId":13723}}
