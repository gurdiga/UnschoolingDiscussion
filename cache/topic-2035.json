Captain Joe Tudela who is our main<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;contact, at the main camp,  is working with the commander of the base  and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Joe asked if we could help.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;School is supposed to open on Sept 1. So this is an urgent need at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;What they are needing for the kids are school supplies.  YOU WILL ALL BE GLAD<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;TO KNOW, I have got hold of another organization ( a Christan Organization<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Group)  that I have worked with since the first days of Operation M. A. L.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;E. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; and they have agreed to help with the MAJOR items.   <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;What I am looking for are the other things, like School bags, Crayons, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;Rulers, Pencils, scissors, anything a children needs to take to school.  Pony<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;tail holders for the girls, combs,  anything you would buy new for a child<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;go to school. Even Story Books. The School is K-8<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I know there are a lot of mixed emotions about if we should help or not, <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;because of   Some people not believing   in the conflict so I am leaving this<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;up to each and every individual to see if they want to. I know you all want<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;to support our troops with care packages For THEM, but we are helping our<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;troops, by helping them, HELP THE KIDS.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I am not even asking you to tell me if you are going to do it..
