When I was in high school I <br/>\n&gt;  didn&#39;t get past intro to algebra. In fact I didn&#39;t even understand <br/>\n&gt;  what it was that they &quot;taught&quot; me in intro to algebra. I took that <br/>\n&gt;  class my sophomore year and was able to get out of taking math the <br/>\n&gt;  remainder of my high school years by taking Cosmotology my Jr and Sr <br/>\n&gt;  years. When I took math in college, about 4 years after I graduated, <br/>\n&gt;  I was placed in the lowest level of math (3 levels below college <br/>\n&gt;  credit algebra). What is interesting is that the whole sememster I <br/>\n&gt;  spent the class doing the assignment that was given at the start of <br/>\n&gt;  class and due the next class. I almost never listened to what was <br/>\n&gt;  said. I just did the math. I think that part of my problem in high <br/>\n&gt;  school is that I wasn&#39;t mature enough to understand what was being <br/>\n&gt;  taught. The equations just didn&#39;t click. I also didn&#39;t understand <br/>\n&gt;  what algebra had to do with me and my life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like this post and can relate both as a &#39;drop-out&#39; and as a homeschooling <br/>\nparent.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience is a little different.  In Jr. High I challenged the 7th grade <br/>\nmath class as being too elementary for me.  I&#39;d already been exposed to the <br/>\nmaterial presented in the 7th grade text and insisted they find me an <br/>\nappropriate class to attend.  (I still chuckle about the whole thing because <br/>\nI really set the whole school district on their ear with this one!  They were <br/>\nnot willing to think outside the little box they put me in and I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwilling to stay in my little box like a good little girl...heheheh)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I finally told them I&#39;d be willing to take the end of year final.   <br/>\nIf I passed, they could put me into the 8th grade class (pre-algebra) and if <br/>\nI didn&#39;t pass, I&#39;d willingly attend the 7th grade class for the rest of the <br/>\nyear.  (kinda sad that as a 12 yr old I had to give the adults a solution).  <br/>\nThey were certain I couldn&#39;t do it and accepted the challenge.  So, I was the <br/>\nfirst 7th grader to attend the pre-algebra class in that school district.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDid fine in algebra courses, but when I got to geometry, I could not get it.  <br/>\nNow, it didn&#39;t help that the local jr. high didn&#39;t teach geometry, but <br/>\nrequired a math class in 9th grade.  So, they bussed me to the local high <br/>\nschool for geometry.  The schedule was such that I arrived at class late and <br/>\nhad no opportunity to discuss the materials with the teacher before I had to <br/>\nbe back on the bus and back to the jr. high.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dropped out of high school in my sophomore year.  Got my GED at age 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward 20 years.  I decided I wanted to go to college and the major I <br/>\nwas interested in involved heavy math and science.   When I tested, I had to <br/>\ntake a remedial class before I was ready for the college level courses in <br/>\nmath.  Once I got over the personal &#39;humiliation&#39; and got started in the <br/>\nclass I loved it!  I discovered that I had not understood the algebra classes <br/>\nI had taken as a teen, in spite of my straight &#39;A&#39; status.  I aced the <br/>\nremedial class and went on to more college math with continued success.  When <br/>\nI got to Trig and Geometry, I had no trouble understanding the concepts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I just needed a bit of maturity and better opportunities to thrive in <br/>\nthe math classes.  I&#39;ve been told by more than one professor that I seem to <br/>\nhave an instinctive ability/talent.  I love it!  (a bit of a brag here, if <br/>\nyou&#39;ll excuse me...when we moved and I had to withdraw from science courses <br/>\nbecause of the distance, my science teacher strongly encouraged me to make a <br/>\npoint of returning to college/science.  She cried that I was leaving.  <br/>\n&lt;smiles&gt;  That felt good, but isn&#39;t the point.  Thanks for my moment to <br/>\npublicly pat myself on the back...&lt;bg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when the math is needed and the desire is there, it will be learned!  <br/>\nRelax.<br/>\n<br/>\n(yeah, I realize I appear to be &#39;forked-tongue-ed&#39; on this one, since I use a <br/>\nmath textbook.  BG  But the point is still the same, relax and do what is <br/>\nbest for you and your child.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_XlexuZOmBjEPRIGO2vGdfc6dLcB02z9n-DnKMx6lV0-HHptqmtKRY4qgf866HWIzcfKdiDH7zI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: I have a problem with my 9yo ds.....","postDate":"965577134","msgId":11809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4LjgyY2IyYjYuMjZiZWUzYWVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11808,"nextInTopic":11830,"prevInTime":11808,"nextInTime":11810,"topicId":11808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/6/2000 8:05:38 AM US Mountain Standard Time, hape2day@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-558021459\">In a message dated 8/6/2000 8:05:38 AM US Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hape2day@...\">hape2day@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Not because they are told they have to or because they <br/>\n are told that life will not be the same without it.
