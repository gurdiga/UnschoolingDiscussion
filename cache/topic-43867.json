So, a<br/>\ntest item that was most often missed by overall high scorers but answered<br/>\ncorrectly by overall low scorers is generally taken out of the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of a standardized system for grading, um, tomoatoes. You would ask<br/>\na series of questions about each tomato (is the color a deep, clear red?<br/>\nis the color uniform? it it firm but not hard? is it uniformly round?)<br/>\nand you would have it set up so that a tomato with 4 or 5 out of 5 yeses<br/>\nis grade A, 3 is grade B, 2 is grade C, and 1 or 2 is sauce. I&#39;m making<br/>\nthese up, I know nothing about tomato grading but I&#39;m currently<br/>\nsurrounded by fields and trucks full of &#39;em.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a standardized test is intended to compare, and to categorize. It&#39;s<br/>\nnot really about whether a kid knows the state standards for learning,<br/>\nit&#39;s about whether he scores better or worse on a test supposedly based<br/>\non those standards than other kids his age - and the tests are set up so<br/>\nthat very few kids will be able to get all of the questions right,<br/>\nthey&#39;re set up so that kids will fail, because god forbid we have too<br/>\nmany Grade A kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think almost all tests should be criterion-referenced, not<br/>\nstandardized. Criterion-referenced tests are like your driver&#39;s license<br/>\ntest - they test whether or not you have mastered a set body of<br/>\nknowledge. You pass or you don&#39;t, and if you don&#39;t you can do it again.<br/>\nYou&#39;re not compared with every other 16 year old who takes the test,<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s not the point. Why does society have this intence need to<br/>\nsort kids out into good tomoatoes and bad tomoatoes?<br/>\n<br/>\ndaron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Maria and GA laws","postDate":"1031928937","msgId":43924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMy4xYjUxMmFmNy4yYWIzNTY2OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43909,"nextInTopic":43945,"prevInTime":43923,"nextInTime":43925,"topicId":43867,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/13/02 2:16:24 AM Central Daylight Time, ...

It gives a timed test in different subject areas like <br/>\nreading, reading comprehension, and math. I remember taking the ITBS (Iowa <br/>\nTest of Basic Skills *I think*) and I know the public schooled kids around <br/>\nhere take the CAT (California Achievement Test) The schools use them to show <br/>\nthey are teaching the right things to the kids, and use the average test <br/>\nscores to get government money. If a school has a low rate of passing or <br/>\naverage grades, they can get grants and other government money. If the school <br/>\nhas a high rate of passing or average grades, they can get grants and other <br/>\ngovernment money. &lt;g&gt; If a child doesn&#39;t *do well* on a test in school the <br/>\nteacher *may* go over the scores with the parents and they *might* discuss <br/>\nthings like average scores and what to do to help Johnny or Susie pass the <br/>\ntest next time! Another thing schools do if they have consistently low scores <br/>\n(all around, not just one or two children) is teach the test. This means that <br/>\nthe teachers spend the majority of their time drilling kids on exactly what <br/>\nthey need to know to pass the tests. In some areas this is to the exclusion <br/>\nof all else in school. In Georgia, if your child takes the test, you get the <br/>\nscores. It will be for you and you only. The problem will be that you will <br/>\nsee this supposed line up of where your child stands compared to an average <br/>\n100 other students. What does that tell you? It tells you that if your child <br/>\nfalls in the 89 percentile, then 87 children did worse than your child and 11 <br/>\npercent did better. It won&#39;t get you extra money, it won&#39;t be reported to <br/>\nyour local third grade teacher. I guess Georgia, like some other states, <br/>\nfeels that parents must want to know where their child stands on this line. <br/>\nBut what does that mean to you as a homeschooler? Well, I guess that depends <br/>\non you and how much importance you place on a test. &lt;g&gt; Just remember there <br/>\nare other states with more rules and restrictions and Unschoolers live and <br/>\n*survive* ;o) in those! &lt;eg&gt; ~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30108381,"authorName":"Maria","from":"&quot;Maria&quot; &lt;lyciall@...&gt;","profile":"lyciall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Maria and GA laws","postDate":"1031901266","msgId":43909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFsczM4aSthdmxjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxMTdCUkFyVmM0SXUxQjZnVnMwMDAwMDFmOEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43897,"nextInTopic":43924,"prevInTime":43908,"nextInTime":43910,"topicId":43867,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... achievement ... grade.
