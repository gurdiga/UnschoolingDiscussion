I&#39;ve talked to <br/>\nher  about the importance of regular bathing.  She doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>\nfair  that she has to take a bath regularly and I pointed out that <br/>\nit&#39;s not just  her, it&#39;s ALL people past a certain age who will smell <br/>\nif they don&#39;t stay  clean.  I told her that people might think poorly <br/>\nof her if she  smells bad and has greasy looking hair.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried getting her  nice soaps and shower gels(she likes that when <br/>\nthey&#39;re new but the novelty  wears off soon and she doesn&#39;t care <br/>\nanymore), I offered to light candles  for her (she says she doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncare about candles), I offered to take a  shower with her and we could <br/>\nwash each other&#39;s backs (she said  no)...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, how much would you remind/try to convince an  11 <br/>\nyear old to shower?  For example, I noticed on Thursday that she  <br/>\nreally needed a shower, so I suggested it to her.  She said, &quot;Maybe  <br/>\nlater&quot;.  So I reminded her again later in the day (like 9 pm) and she  <br/>\nsaid, &quot;later&quot;.  She never did.  Friday she was REALLY smelling  bad, <br/>\nand I told her that.  She said, &quot;later&quot;.  I reminded her  again, and <br/>\nshe said, &quot;First thing tomorrow morning, I promise&quot;.   Saturday <br/>\nmorning she didn&#39;t shower.  Nor did she all day  Saturday.  Today, I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;How about if you take a shower and then  pick out some nail <br/>\npolish and I&#39;ll paint your toenails after your  shower?  So she did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAm I nagging too much?  If I  remind her once and she doesn&#39;t do it, <br/>\nshould I keep reminding her or just  let it go?  What about the issue <br/>\nof body odor and not wanting other  people to look down on her?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****************<br/>\nAh, pre-teens! I&#39;ve spent time in a car with bunches of stinky pre-teens,  <br/>\nand it&#39;s not pretty!<br/>\n <br/>\nFirst, I&#39;d try really hard to let go of fear of other people&#39;s judgements.  <br/>\nRight now she doesn&#39;t seem to care too much anyway, and when she does she&#39;ll  <br/>\nfeel bad about herself. I know that&#39;s not what you want.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s fair to point out that when she smells it&#39;s kind of unpleasant to be  <br/>\nnear her, especially in a closed space. Would she be open to compromise? Maybe  <br/>\nuse a washcloth every day in the smelly bits, along with some deodorant? She  <br/>\ncould pick out one of those teen, fruity kinds of deodorant.  That will  help.<br/>\n <br/>\nAbout the hair. Get some dry shampoo...one of those things for quick  <br/>\ntouch-ups. The other thing that works to cut the grease is putting a little  powder <br/>\non a hairbrush and brushing it through.  She might like these things  because <br/>\nthey won&#39;t interrupt her life as much as a bath or shower. Then every  few days <br/>\nor so she could do a &quot;deep clean.&quot;  Just don&#39;t try to make her  not-a-kid too <br/>\nfast. This is a very &quot;kid&quot; thing, and she&#39;s clearly not ready to  be a young <br/>\nadult yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is one of those things you&#39;ll remember in a year or two when she&#39;s in  <br/>\nthe bathroom a LOT. Isn&#39;t that weird about parents and child development? We  <br/>\nreally need to lighten up, and sometimes it&#39;s SO hard to do that.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98660,"nextTopicId":98751}}
