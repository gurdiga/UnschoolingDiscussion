Boasting!  And about your children too no less!  How bizarre!  LOL  I am sure that we can all use that kind of a feel-good-about-our-acomplishments boost all the time.  Especially when we have non-mainstream lifestyles and take a lot of criticism and negativity because of it.  <br/>\nI can&#39;t believe all that you do with 7 kids....I can&#39;t even fathom having 7 kids, I can barely keep up with 2!  Or maybe it just Feels that way some days when the diapers and tanturms are on overload.  I&#39;m sure I would bend with the wind if it blew that way.  Anyway, what I am trying to say in my non-coherent state it:  Hats off to you Carol.  Good Job and keep up the fantastic work and good job to your kids too.
