I had surgery on my eye when I<br/>\n  was 9 maybe 10.  My left eye was crossed.  It stared at my nose.  The surgery<br/>\n  I had centered my eye.  The surgeon also did some experimental surgery on my<br/>\n  pupil or something to try and correct my vision (If people look really closely<br/>\n  at my eye they can see the ways the pupil was cut up).  I saw that surgery on<br/>\n  TLC quite a few years ago (though I think it was improved). I also had the eye<br/>\n  glasses and eye patch therapy to strenghthen the straightened eye.  After<br/>\n  about a year of therapy the doctor told my parents that the eye wasn&#39;t getting<br/>\n  any stronger and told me I could be rid of the eye patch and glasses. <br/>\n  Fortunately my right eye has perfectly good vision.
