My rule of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1844247337\">We bought our digital camera on ebay (and my wedding dress and veil and<br/>\ntiara and all our kids&#39; tuxes and my wedding stationary and and and...).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy rule of thumb is to *only* buy from vendors who have sold a *ton* and who<br/>\nhave been selling for several months. Also, many times I will write someone<br/>\nprivately and make the sale that way. They often have more than one of the<br/>\nsame product and will sometimes sell for cheaper because I save them the<br/>\nhassle of putting the item up for bid (and the cost, albeit minimal).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you know exactly what product you are looking for, check out the<br/>\nperson&#39;s selling history, other items up for bid, rating, etc. This tells me<br/>\na lot about what kind of seller the person is. And also keep in mind a good<br/>\nebayer will be as leery of you (first time buyer) as you are of them. They<br/>\nhave a lot to lose too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had a bad ebay experience. I did buy something once that wasn&#39;t<br/>\nexactly what I expected (a toy - the picture made it look *much* larger than<br/>\nit was but clearly stated the size) but I am still extremely happy with it<br/>\nand that was *my* error.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we bought our digital camera, we also negotiated (behind the scenes,<br/>\nafter we won the auction) for extras at a lower price. A bag, an extra<br/>\nbattery, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Molly Mahnke","from":"Molly Mahnke &lt;elmamahnke@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"px20Hn6gGyuKdkifoLzvXvOB-PgfQKfsvnDmmaVNtjy10B3xkUCwpTReZ8Y5GKn0PBaL4VTSR7y5_ZGrQmV3xAjVu7GqgeIIBms","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Ebay","postDate":"993131911","msgId":22669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNjIxMTM1ODMxLjk1OTQ4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0NTA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNCMzFFOTVBLjEzRkI0MzFFQGFsbHRlbC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":22668,"nextInTopic":22670,"prevInTime":22668,"nextInTime":22670,"topicId":22668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Ann, If you have ANY questions about it: condition, manufacturer s warranty, etc. etc., ask BEFORE you place a bid.
