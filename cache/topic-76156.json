I heard about the list<br/>\nfrom someone on another list recently and it sounded very interesting<br/>\neven though my kids and I actually go to school every day during the<br/>\nschool year, them as students and I as a teacher.<br/>\n            I myself was homeschooled started at the age of 10.  For the<br/>\nfirst year or possibly two, we (my older brother and I) had assignments,<br/>\ntons of books to read and papers to write, workbooks, etc.  After that,<br/>\nwe were seemingly forgotten about as my younger brothers began learning<br/>\nto read and such and were &quot;accidentally unschooled&quot; as I like to call<br/>\nit.  I started taking community college classes at 13, and started doing<br/>\nrandom rebellious things to mess up my life at about 16.  When I was 17<br/>\nI took the California High School Proficiency Exam to obtain a diploma<br/>\nalthough I already had plenty of college units.  I eventually had a<br/>\nbaby, finished college at a normal time, with excellent grades, and got<br/>\na teaching credential.  When I was pregnant and single at 18, teaching<br/>\nseemed like an excellent career choice since I enjoyed school, loved<br/>\nlearning, and would have plenty of time off with my kid(s).  Since then<br/>\nI have gotten married to a single-dad, and we have had another kid.<br/>\n            Our kids are now 12, 8, and 4, all boys.  I have taught full<br/>\ntime for 2 years, jr. high at a private school which my kids attend.<br/>\nWhen I got my contract for next year, I tried to talk my kids into<br/>\nstaying home and unschooling.  The oldest really wants to continue at<br/>\nthe private school for junior high, the middle one waffled back and<br/>\nforth with maybe a slight preference for staying home, and the youngest<br/>\nwould probably love staying home, but also usually loves going to school<br/>\n- especially since he can often come see mommy at her classroom, or see<br/>\nhis brothers during recesses, etc.  Unfortunately in this situation it&#39;s<br/>\nall or nothing because without my teacher&#39;s 93% tuition discount there<br/>\nis no way we could afford to send anyone to this school.  So I signed<br/>\nthe contract for at least another year.  I don&#39;t want to be a teacher,<br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t believe in the educational system.  However, I<br/>\nabsolutely love the kids and getting to know them and I enjoy the<br/>\nsubject matter.  I also enjoy being out of the house every day (summer<br/>\nvacation drives me nuts sometimes, having too much time on my hands and<br/>\nstarting massive projects and overturning the house).  Whether I teach<br/>\nor not, someone is going to be force-feeding them algebra and physical<br/>\nscience and I am probably the lesser of many evils, lol.<br/>\n            I am interested in this list because I think unschooling is<br/>\nthe best way to learn although I realize it will never happen in most<br/>\nfamilies.  I believe in non-coercion in general, especially when it<br/>\ncomes to learning.  I have read Guerilla Learning and have ordered<br/>\nColoring Outside the Lines.  I am interested in helping my children to<br/>\nreally learn what they want to learn despite the fact that they will be<br/>\nin school.<br/>\n            I have much more to say, but need to stop for now.<br/>\nHopefully my input will be tolerated on this list, and I hope to learn<br/>\nmuch from you all.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Friday, July 04, 2003 10:17 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-Discussion] Germany! but what about...<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nLearning is learning.
