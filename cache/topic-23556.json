I wish I had time to get more<br/>\ninto the discussions...<br/>\nJust to toss out my experience with &#39;back -to-school&#39;...Let&#39;s see....last<br/>\nevening my youngsters and I played outside after dinner until dark (as we<br/>\nlove to do in the good &#39;ol summertime!) All the neighbors glumly had to go<br/>\nin by 7:45 or 8 to get ready for the early rising.  I was sad for them and<br/>\ntheir missing out on the nicest &#39;playing out&#39; weather.<br/>\n  I have noticed,  like someone else,  the &#39;school kids&#39; hang out here more<br/>\njust prior to school starting .... &#39;cause their parents are SO busy getting<br/>\nthings ready,  they don&#39;t have time for being with the kids.  I also have<br/>\nnoticed the school kids stress levels....during the 1st few weeks of school<br/>\nas they adjust to that treacherous early schedule and during the last few<br/>\nweeks of school,  when they&#39;re about bursting to get OUT of that cycle of<br/>\nschool!  These are the times when I find my patience with them being tried<br/>\nimmensely!!<br/>\n   One amusing anecdote...a family on our street inevitably comes to the end<br/>\nof school vacation and hasn&#39;t provided all the &#39;experiences&#39; they&#39;d promised<br/>\ntheir kids at the beginning - so they try to cram it all in!  The day before<br/>\nschool started they a) went to the Children&#39; Museum with us for 2-1/2 hrs<br/>\n(we stayed...they had to go), b)went to Fantasy Frontier to drive little<br/>\ncars c) went to laser tag, d) went bowling and e) had a marshmallow roast as<br/>\na goodbye to summer  ROTFL!!  Of course,  they had to finish all this by<br/>\n8p.m. so they could go bathe and get their school &#39;stuff&#39; ready!<br/>\n    At dinner tonight my 6yog said Courtney wanted her to go to school with<br/>\nher.  I asked if she meant to visit....my dd said she thought so....she said<br/>\nCourtney wanted her to see the place they get to play every day.  DD thought<br/>\nit was great that they got to play at school.  Older dd explained that they<br/>\ndo get to play at school...BUT it&#39;s only about 15 minutes after lunch ...not<br/>\nmuch in a 7 hour day!  We discussed the other limitations...always the same<br/>\nplayground....always crowded, etc.  DD decided her life is much better the<br/>\nway it is!!<br/>\nSuz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23555,"nextTopicId":23131}}
