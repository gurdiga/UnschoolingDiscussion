I can&#39;t expect the kids to not be kids and be <br/>\nquiet just so she and I can talk. We have her and her kids over so the kids <br/>\ncan play, not so they can tiptoe around us while we talk! She has this whole <br/>\npuritan children should be seen, not heard issue hanging on in her brain, <br/>\nalthough she would deny it, I&#39;m sure. I also have to remind her that a day of <br/>\nplay with her kids is not a typical day at our house. Nor is having her kids <br/>\nover the same as having their neighborhood friends over. I use this analogy <br/>\nfor her all the time. *We have dessert almost every night, most nights it is <br/>\na handful of cookies, a small bowl of ice-cream or some fruit. (That is the <br/>\nneighborhood kids.) Three or four times a year, we go to Kansas City and have <br/>\ndinner and dessert at the Cheesecake Factory. (That is her kids.)* Her kids <br/>\nare a special treat for my kids, her kids feel the same way about my kids, <br/>\nand when they get together, my house shakes! The kids let their hair down, <br/>\nthe rules about jumping off the bed onto someone are still there. The rules <br/>\nabout playing in the street are still there, to me nothing has changed, just <br/>\nthe noise level. To her it is indicative of how things are 24/7 at our home. <br/>\nI can, at any time tell my kids that things are getting over the top, and <br/>\nthey will respect that in an instant. BUT when they are having their special <br/>\ntreat friends over, I hate to do that. I would send them all to the park, but <br/>\nthat would involve her letting go of her parental control for too long. I <br/>\nwould suggest that she and I go to the porch swing if the kids are inside or <br/>\nthe couch if they are out side, but again that would be too much for her. She <br/>\nhas to be &quot;on top of the situation at all times&quot; as she calls it. So in the <br/>\nend we agree to disagree. She can&#39;t imagine being with her kids as much as I <br/>\nam with mine, and I can&#39;t imagine being on top of my kids as she is with <br/>\nhers! <br/>\nIn our family, we all have a healthy respect for each other, Moly and Jack <br/>\nknow when too much is too much. They wouldn&#39;t want us nit picking at them <br/>\nover every little thing, I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to them. They also know <br/>\nthat there are situations where it is better if Mom or Dad &quot;takes control.&quot; <br/>\nMeeting new people, being in a really crowded, unfamiliar area, something <br/>\nlike that.

If it means I&#39;m not taking what my <br/>\nchildren&#39;s <br/>\nviewpoints are very seriously, or listening to them with equal <br/>\nrespect, then <br/>\nno, control is not good.<br/>\nBut I think that&#39;s just semantics really. Because I do control <br/>\nsituations <br/>\nevery day.<br/>\nWhether you want to call it control or just plain parenting, matters <br/>\nnot.<br/>\nThe fact is, I do control certains situations.<br/>\nWhich ones?<br/>\nWell, first and foremost, safety issues.<br/>\nI control my toddler if he wants to run in the street, grab a sharp <br/>\nknife, <br/>\nclimb somewhere dangerous etc....<br/>\nI control the older children by saying NO to something that is truly <br/>\ndangerous....but I explain why and they usually understand. The key <br/>\nhere, is <br/>\nto make sure it is truly dangerous, not just my own prejudice or <br/>\nfears being <br/>\nprojected.<br/>\nLike at the beach.....does my own fear of sharks or rip tides really <br/>\naffect <br/>\nthem going out into deeper water? Or is the water fairly safe that <br/>\nday and I <br/>\njust need to shut up?<br/>\nIt&#39;s a constant questioning of myself and what the dangers truly are.<br/>\nLetting them go out in the deeper water is probably safer than the <br/>\nsun <br/>\nexposure we get.....so some fears are just mine, and not reasonable <br/>\nto apply <br/>\nto them.<br/>\nRegardless, I do control safetly issues. That&#39;s my job as a parent, <br/>\nto keep <br/>\nthem safe and to point out ways they can keep themselves as safe as <br/>\npossible <br/>\n(after all, safety is something of an illusion in this dangerous <br/>\nworld!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond item of control, which sorta gets back to safety....<br/>\nI control them if they are trying to verbally or physically hurt <br/>\nanyone.<br/>\nIf there is conflict and they need help resolving it, I control the <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\nFor me, that does not equal punishment or my will over theirs. It <br/>\nsimply <br/>\nmeans I may separate people or call a &quot;time out&quot; (meaning stop what <br/>\nyou&#39;re <br/>\ndoing right now so we can talk...like a &quot;pause&quot; button) to resolve <br/>\nthe <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\nI don&#39;t let fighting spin out of control, or one person be rude and <br/>\nmean to <br/>\nanother. I think it&#39;s taking everyone&#39;s needs into account and it&#39;s <br/>\nmy job to <br/>\nmake sure they have a safe venue for doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, on these other issues, I say I am indeed controlling the <br/>\nsituation, but <br/>\nothers may say no, that isn&#39;t control.<br/>\nLike when we have a guest coming over, and I care that the house is <br/>\nstraightened up. I may ask everyone to pitch in and help me clean up. <br/>\nOr if <br/>\nI&#39;m just frustrated with it, I might be more pushy than usual.<br/>\nI think that is a type of control, although if my kids said &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to <br/>\nfinish X,Y,Z and then I&#39;ll come help you Mom&quot; I would listen to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetting them choose how to spend their own money, how to dress, what <br/>\nto eat <br/>\n(I  have a big part in choosing what comes into the house and what to <br/>\ncook <br/>\nbut they decide in the end), what to learn etc...<br/>\nThese are ways we can relinquish unecessary control.<br/>\nThe choices aren&#39;t to leave the kids on their own OR control them.<br/>\nThere is a happy medium, called dialoguing with them, working with <br/>\nthem, <br/>\nrespecting them while respecting yourself and giving them a variety <br/>\nof tools <br/>\nto use in different situations.<br/>\nIf I&#39;m trying to carry on a conversation with another adult, and my <br/>\nkids are <br/>\ngetting too loud, I might suggest that they move it elsewhere <br/>\n(outside maybe) <br/>\nor remind them that I can&#39;t even hear the other person. So far <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been <br/>\nwilling to try and respect my request.....TRY being the key word. :)<br/>\nI also don&#39;t expect to have much adult conversation if we&#39;re having <br/>\nfriends <br/>\nover for them.

I like to think of it as a <br/>\nfriendship <br/>\nwe&#39;re building together. I have more experience, so it&#39;s kind of like <br/>\nhaving <br/>\na foreigner in my home that needs guidance.  Guidance is a good <br/>\nthing, it&#39;s <br/>\nall about how you approach it....with love and respect, or with anger <br/>\nand <br/>\nhumiliation.
