A few times I saw moving suggested.

But maybe it&#39;s a good civics/poli-sci lesson that freedoms <br/>\n  in the <br/>\n  &gt; U.S. seem to be greater in newer and smaller states.   Laws seem to <br/>\n  be <br/>\n  &gt; created when people are thick together, or when they&#39;ve been there <br/>\n  a long <br/>\n  &gt; time.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  And even in Pennsylvania, one can unschool.  One can find an <br/>\n  evaluator who understands and supports unschooling.  And Mom will <br/>\n  have to put a lot of work into it, but it is possible to make  a <br/>\n  portfolio for an unschooler that will impress them enough that they <br/>\n  will leave you alone. Usually anyway.   It doesn&#39;t mean that you <br/>\n  might not go to court or might not have to fight with the school <br/>\n  district on stuff.  But it&#39;s not just the unschoolers that have to <br/>\n  worry about that.  The most strict school at homers are in danger of <br/>\n  geing picked on too. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We tried to pass a less restrictive homeschool law in PA, and it was <br/>\n  tabled at the end of November.  Part of the problem is that there  <br/>\n  were some homeschoolers who actually lobbied against it, saying that <br/>\n  if they didn&#39;t have the state to be accountable to, they might not do <br/>\n  a good job educating their children.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Compulsory attendance laws are old.  We can&#39;t roll back that far; <br/>\n  all those <br/>\n  &gt; who voted for them are dead.  (Except those who lately extended <br/>\n  them to 18 or <br/>\n  &gt; back to five or six, in some states.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Check out www.sepschool.org<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; But people have found practical, workable ways to comply with <br/>\n  Pennsylvania <br/>\n  &gt; laws, and so those would be the people to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any unschooler in Pennsylvania who claims that there is no problem <br/>\n  here is under a delusion.  Yes, it can be done and I do it.  But one <br/>\n  change of personnel in my school district could change that.  One <br/>\n  shift in the superintendent&#39;s attitude could change that.  A <br/>\n  superintendent could wake up on the wrong side of the bed one morning <br/>\n  and decide to make life miserable for homeschoolers--and do it.  He <br/>\n  has that much power. Superintendents ask for things above and beyond <br/>\n  the law all the time, and get away with it.  So any homeschooler in <br/>\n  PA who brags about how easy they have it is really just bragging that <br/>\n  the superintendent of their local school district is a somewhat <br/>\n  decent person who cooperates with homeschoolers enough to not hassle <br/>\n  them. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Again, my point is not that we should change anything about the way <br/>\n  we unschool in order to comply with a law.  However, just like <br/>\n  someone might say, &quot;Ugh, my mother in law is coming for a visit and <br/>\n  she is going to make unschooling difficult for us for a few weeks&quot;, <br/>\n  someone from PA might say, &quot;Ugh, my superintendent just called and <br/>\n  said that he doesn&#39;t think my portfolio shows that my son has had an <br/>\n  appropriate 4th grade education&quot;.  There are practical suggestions <br/>\n  for getting the mother in law off someone&#39;s back and there are <br/>\n  practical suggestions for getting a superintendent off someone&#39;s <br/>\n  back.  In neither situation should a person stop unschooling, they <br/>\n  should just find a way to get the problem people off of their backs <br/>\n  so that they CAN unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I look at homeschoolers, esp. unschoolers, and think how great <br/>\n<br/>\nit is. Then I look at public schools, and think, there must be a better <br/>\n<br/>\nway. But while we can, one family at a time, step away from the schools, <br/>\n<br/>\nhow does an entire culture step away? What about all those kids there? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, I guess my interest in, concern for, the schools and who&#39;s in <br/>\n<br/>\nthem really isn&#39;t part of unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany unschooling parents are former teachers who have dedicated a chunk of <br/>\nlives to making it better.  When I quit teaching, I couldn&#39;t even stand to <br/>\nwatch TV reports about the sad state of the schools.  If Time or Newsweek had <br/>\nan article on how bad the schools were, I wouldn&#39;t even open to that page.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s a better way, it&#39;s probably been tried and failed in the midst of <br/>\nschool realities.  There are lists and sites to discuss that, and they might <br/>\nreally welcome unschoolers&#39; points of views EXCEPT that they can&#39;t implement <br/>\nmuch freedom into such a behemoth.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt was a school reformer.  There were lots of influential school <br/>\nreformers in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s, and attempts were made then to institute <br/>\n&quot;open classroom&quot; methods, but in public schools they fail to work.  That was <br/>\nproven repeatedly and at great expense.  That&#39;s what caused  many parents to <br/>\ntake their kids out of school and for John Holt to write &quot;Teach Your Own,&quot; <br/>\nand to found Growing Without Schooling magazine.   (Then a few years later <br/>\nfundamentalist Christians somehow imagined they had invented homeschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Also, if you can&#39;t unschool in your state, <br/>\n<br/>\nthen what? A few times I saw moving suggested. I do think this is an <br/>\n<br/>\nimportant issue --- why should someone in a country supposedly about <br/>\n<br/>\nfreedom and the individual have to move?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPennsylvania has more laws than I can BELIEVE would be allowed in the United <br/>\nStates.  But maybe it&#39;s a good civics/poli-sci lesson that freedoms in the <br/>\nU.S. seem to be greater in newer and smaller states.   Laws seem to be <br/>\ncreated when people are thick together, or when they&#39;ve been there a long <br/>\ntime.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, something not often glorified:  The original colonies were NOT set up <br/>\naccording to what is not seen as inalienable rights.  Some of them were very <br/>\nrepressive.  And the creation of the U.S. didn&#39;t totally cut off their <br/>\ntraditions of repression. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut one thing they didn&#39;t change is that American citizens can move freely <br/>\nfrom one state to another without telling anybody they&#39;re gone.   So if <br/>\nliving in New Mexico means I have to see people wearing guns or having guns <br/>\nin their pickups and I don&#39;t WANT to see that, I can move.  If living in <br/>\nTexas means you have to see people wearing Texas jewelry and eating grits and <br/>\nyou can&#39;t stand that, you can move north or west to the green chile zone.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There is something seriously <br/>\n<br/>\nwrong if the government is telling us how to raise our children, and <br/>\n<br/>\neven if we don&#39;t live in that state, I do think it is everyone&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\nconcern.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCompulsory attendance laws are old.  We can&#39;t roll back that far; all those <br/>\nwho voted for them are dead.  (Except those who lately extended them to 18 or <br/>\nback to five or six, in some states.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Another state could look at that and think it&#39;s a good idea, or <br/>\n<br/>\nno one objects, or any other excuse to further curb our freedoms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>States don&#39;t like the federal government telling them what to do (unless <br/>\nthere are big bucks attached to compliance), so they absolutely won&#39;t want <br/>\npeople in other states telling them what to do.    I think people have enough <br/>\nproblems in their own states and with their own kids without trying to reform <br/>\nschools or homeschooling laws in other states.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut people have found practical, workable ways to comply with Pennsylvania <br/>\nlaws, and so those would be the people to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52319,"nextTopicId":52452}}
