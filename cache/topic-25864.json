I am not trying to push religion, but I think<br/>\nit could be a possible history.<br/>\n In the bible story where Rebecca and Jacob tricked their father, so that<br/>\nEsau would not get his birthright inheritance is where the holy was started,<br/>\nand it has never ceased. Jacob had to leave work in fields for 14 years, and<br/>\nEsau wanted to kill him.  Esau could be the disgruntled Christian. Whether<br/>\nthe story is historically accurate-the point of this story for me is<br/>\nforgiveness, and keeping peace in the family.<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25676,"nextTopicId":25791}}
