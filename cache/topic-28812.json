But I think discipline and<br/>\n  respect are a tough thing to work out naturally since most people are more<br/>\n  naturally inclined to discipline than respect and if respect without the<br/>\n  discipline works, then why take chances?<br/>\n  For the past 5 yrs of trying to homeschool I have been wondering what I am doing wrong that my kids resist doing anything I suggest doing, in terms of schoolwork. I have friends that homeschool. Some I know have the same problems I do. Some do seem to have complacent kids. One family sticks out in that they are not fundamentalist Christian and her kids do tons of work and seem so bookish and smart. They do full Calvert and even other things on top of that. I can see, she is the dictator type that demands respect. Her kids seems to be thriving. She bugs the heck out of me sometimes with her comments, though. She complains about her 11 yo son being a &quot;straight B&quot; student. His efforts are lacking, in her eyes, she still complains about his &quot;writing ability&quot; or lack thereof. I know this kid is doing tons more work than my 10 yo son.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As to how she *gets* her kids to do the work, I asked her once. She says the threat of going back to school is always there. And also she only lets her kids do the things they want (like gaming or having friends over) only when their schoolwork is done.<br/>\n  She got kind of annoyed with my question like &quot;Duh, you&#39;re the mom. You&#39;re in charge.&quot;<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know, I tried those things too, with my kids, and didn&#39;t get anywhere. That&#39;s why I&#39;m unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for your input to my question.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Karin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
