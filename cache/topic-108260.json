If we thought unschooling was more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1585460374\">&quot;Do you think unschooling is more or less stressful than not<br/>\nhomeschooling in any way, just sending your kids to school?&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we thought unschooling was more stressful, why on earth would we <br/>\nbe doing it? Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf sending my kids to school was less stressful, I&#39;d do it! <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it though, by the time children are school age, they&#39;re <br/>\njust getting &quot;easier&quot; as far as all the messes and high need for <br/>\nMom&#39;s attention. If you&#39;re happy having them home as babies and <br/>\ntoddlers, why would you have less stress by sending them away at age <br/>\n5?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, school causes all kinds of new stresses that unschooling <br/>\nfamilies don&#39;t deal with. Putting children into a peer situation <br/>\nother than their family, creates separation and social situations <br/>\nchildren shouldn&#39;t have to deal with. The negativity a child deals <br/>\nwith in school spills over to home, the schoolwork invades family <br/>\nlife even further...school causes families to separate, not get <br/>\ncloser!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you can factor in living by an institution&#39;s schedule, <br/>\ntransportation and not having the freedom to travel when you <br/>\nchoose...sounds like a whole load of stress I&#39;d rather avoid. Not to <br/>\nmention the stress the child deals with if they don&#39;t want to be <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nLIFE has stresses. Living the unschooling life does not shield me <br/>\nfrom reality. But at least our reality is what we choose, not what <br/>\nsociety decided to dish out. Our lives are pretty stress free <br/>\noverall. Unschooling has a lot to do with that....a LOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78353,"nextTopicId":108198}}
