I am new to the list.  I thought I would wait for a few more days to<br/>\nintroduce myself but, after reading several of Sharon&#39;s posts, I decided to<br/>\njump in now.  Like Sharon, I have a large family.  We have nine surviving of<br/>\nten children, consisting of his, mine, ours and more of ours (this last grop<br/>\nbeing our adopted children).  Needless to say, they are ALL ours.  We each<br/>\nbrought a boy and a girl into this marriage.  Those &quot;children&quot; are now 29,<br/>\n29, 26, and 25.  The two girls are married and one has a 2 year old son, with<br/>\na new baby daughter on the way.  We have two girls from this marriage, aged<br/>\n14 and 12.  We were foster parents for quite some time, having 40 foster<br/>\nchildren, over the years.  Of those forty, we adopted four, although,<br/>\ntragically, our first adopted son died from a surgical error.  The ages of<br/>\nthe youngest set of children is 10, 6, and 5.  Our two oldest &quot;still at home&quot;<br/>\ndaughters are dyslexic and the youngest three have a number of special<br/>\nneeds.  We homeschool four of our five children who are still at home.  We<br/>\nhope to someday be able to homeschool our 10 yo boy, too.  His needs are<br/>\nnumerous and I haven&#39;t been able to figure out how to be able to meet his<br/>\nneeds, plus the other four.  Also, I am caring for my dad, who is terminally<br/>\nill.  This is our ninth year of homeschooling.  Like many, we began with a<br/>\nmore formal approach than we have now.  We are basically unschoolers now<br/>\nalthough, I still find myself worrying that, especially the oldest, are not<br/>\ngetting enough.
