Second, we don&#39;t call them chores:)<br/>\nand we don&#39;t do them on a schedule or even very regularly. Beds don&#39;t have to be<br/>\nmade, toys don&#39;t have to be put away before we leave, etc. I also involve my<br/>\noldest in all the chores that are done. She sits at the sink when washing dishes<br/>\nand &#39;helps&#39; by rinsing or drying or handing dishes to me. When we clean the<br/>\nbathroom, I scrub the tub and shes cleans the toilet with vinegar and baking soda<br/>\n(it fizzes so its fun) and a brush. When I vaccuum she does also with her own<br/>\nvaccuum and uses mine when I&#39;m finished. This is just part of our day and is<br/>\nnever something that &#39;needs&#39; to be done. If dd doesn&#39;t feel like participating,<br/>\nthen she doesn&#39;t (and the &#39;chore&#39; won&#39;t necessarily get done either since we<br/>\nusually start doing something else:), but this rarely happens (so far, remember<br/>\nshe&#39;s young:). Sometimes I don&#39;t feel like cleaning the bathroom when she wants<br/>\nto, so we don&#39;t do it, or she does it by herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also keep an open discussion about what we are doing. As adults, there are<br/>\nthings that have to be done. When I&#39;m writing my lesson plans for class, or doing<br/>\nresearch for a paper that&#39;s due, I talk with Fiona about why it has to be done<br/>\nright then and why I can&#39;t play with her at the moment. More often than not,<br/>\nthough, I will still take a break and play for a few minutes before resuming my<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is usually untidy. Fiona seems to reach a point where she needs to pick<br/>\nup her toys and then will do it. Sometimes, dh or I reach that point first and do<br/>\nit, while trying to involve her. We have the rule whoever notices it takes care<br/>\nof it. We don&#39;t see any of it as a &#39;chore&#39; though, just another thing to do<br/>\ntogether. What we have found so far is that Fiona is taking on more and more<br/>\nresponsibility as we go. She is noticing when things are dirty and asks to clean<br/>\nthem or even starts on her own (ie the toilet, she could do that every day:) This<br/>\nhas also helped dh and I since we no longer say things like &quot;well, I cooked so<br/>\nits your turn to wash the dishes&quot;. Sometimes we don&#39;t even wash the dishes after<br/>\na meal and wait to do it the next day (or two or three days later if the mood<br/>\nstrikes). Not everyone can live this way, my mom hates it:) But as we have been<br/>\nmoving towards the unschooling way of thinking we have found that we continusly<br/>\nevaluate things based on their importance in the moment, and more likely than not<br/>\nwashing dishes or cleaning the bathroom loses:)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy,<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa F.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/25/99 4:26:31 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eifuller@...\">eifuller@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;  Keeping<br/>\n&gt; the house, and learning how to keep a house, are important skills.
