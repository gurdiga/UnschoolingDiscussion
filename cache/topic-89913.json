They learned <br/>\nfrom life itself. When people asked &quot;how could you do that?&quot; or &quot;why <br/>\naren&#39;t you in school?&quot; the two would reply, &quot;we learn from <br/>\neverything around us.&quot; The parents would say &quot;we don&#39;t believe in <br/>\ngovernment control raising our children.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nand the teacher&#39;s comment: <br/>\n                           How could this happen?
