Are Lynda&#39;s pussycats -- show dogs, pets, your general average dog who<br/>\nwas raised well and lives with a family that took some time to train him.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Are actual pit dogs, bred and used for fighting other dogs in a pit. No<br/>\npit dog worth spitting at bites a human, and most of them won&#39;t bother with<br/>\ncats or dogs who are not a fair fight to them. This is not to say I approve<br/>\nin any way of dog fighting, just that there are real dog fighters and people<br/>\nwho are just mucking around saying they&#39;re dog fighters who aren&#39;t, and both<br/>\nhave pit bulls. Real fighting pit bulls are specifically bred to be<br/>\n*extremely* even-tempered with people, as in the heat of a dog fight the<br/>\nhandlers have to be able to reach into the pit and grab the dogs without<br/>\ngetting their hands bitten off.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Are the media version of pit bulls. Some of the dogs which are blamed for<br/>\nattacking people are pit bulls. Some are not, but media and animal control<br/>\nofficers and police officers say they are because they don&#39;t know any better<br/>\nabout identifying dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any good stats on which types of pit bulls are in the majority<br/>\nstate-wide, nation-wide, world-wide.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an inner city, probably number 3, with the caveat that some of the people<br/>\nwho think they have pit bulls don&#39;t (don&#39;t get me started on the number of<br/>\npeople who think they have a 48% &quot;wolf hybrid&quot; and don&#39;t &lt;g&gt;). Some do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a dog training class, probably number 1. At a dog show, number 1. At a<br/>\ndog fight in West Virginia, number 2 (no pun intended &lt;g&gt;). Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23975,"nextTopicId":24004}}
