Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, they were really cool!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest son (11) really enjoys video games and art and music are important components for him.  He really notices the artistic details of the games - a couple weeks ago he pointed out to me how beautiful the water surface was in the new Crystal Chronicles game.  He surfs the internet finding his fave screenshots and fan art, changing the wallpaper on the computer desktop often.  He has a sketchbook in which he has some beautiful sketches of characters and that he adds to as they strike his fancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for music, he has his favourite music from various games and levels/battles, and he has been known to plug in audio from one game, and choosing his fave track/level for background music while plugging in video and playing another game.  He&#39;ll regularly call me over to listen to his fave music and discuss it, explaining to me how the music matches the mood of the level or how it changes subtly as say, the battle progresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven when he&#39;s not playing he&#39;ll often pick game music to have on in the background, either through his console or through various websites with game tracks that you can play.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s replaying Golden Sun 1 & 2 right now and I recognized the music instantly!  It&#39;s almost like a comfy glove even for me.  I&#39;ve been humming it for a couple days now.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"music and art in video games","postDate":"1078863885","msgId":91704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOC4xYWRmYjkzYi4yZDdmODIwZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":91705,"prevInTime":91703,"nextInTime":91705,"topicId":91704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The apple site has two REALLY interesting articles today on news in music and art in video games.

I figure there are very few families here whose kids <br/>\naren&#39;t interested in one or two or all of those topics, so here are some excerpts <br/>\nand links.  I&#39;ve also linked this to my video games page, so if you don&#39;t <br/>\nthink you care today and change your mind later, you can find it by going to <br/>\nsandradodd.com/unschooling, and to video games, and it&#39;s right up top.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra (quotes start after this):<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGazing across the flat, grassy plains of a virtual savannah, you may as well <br/>\nbe standing on another planet — which, in a sense, you are. The Myst-like <br/>\nvirtual world of Dr. Hilary Rhodes’ “Exploration Without Boundaries” is built <br/>\nwith three-dimensional dreamscapes that have never been captured on film, and <br/>\nnever could be.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart theater, part art, “Exploration Without Boundaries” invites armchair <br/>\ntravelers to explore 48 virtual landscapes that Rhodes created on the Mac as <br/>\npart of her doctoral thesis at Australia’s University of Wollongong near Sydney.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresented in QuickTime Virtual Reality (QTVR) Cubic, the scenes let travelers <br/>\nwander icy Arctic wastes, gently-rolling hills reminiscent of English moors, <br/>\nvolcanic islands, deserts and a dozen other fantasy landscapes — all to the <br/>\nsounds of winds soughing through the grass, ethnic music, excerpts by composers <br/>\nsuch as Ralph Vaughan Williams and her own compositions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/pro/design/rhodes/\">http://www.apple.com/pro/design/rhodes/</a><br/>\nand there&#39;s a sample of the game<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n“Films are stories you watch,” says Clint Bajakian, “and music underscores <br/>\nthem — but you could tell the stories very well without music.  <br/>\n<br/>\n“Video games are activities you play,” continues Bajakian. “When the player <br/>\ngets his senses and faculties engaged in achieving an objective — in the <br/>\nhot-and-heavy moments of actual button-mashing and getting tense — the story <br/>\nrecedes to the background. He may even forget it while he figures out, How do I <br/>\nclimb this wall?”<br/>\n<br/>\nThat’s why, Bajakian says, music is so important. “When the story goes to <br/>\nthe background, the music stays there and does the job of transmitting emotional <br/>\nimpulses to the player. It defines the mood. Music has the primary role of <br/>\ncommunicating emotion in a game. Often it’s the driving force. It’s almost <br/>\nimpossible to think of it as an underscore.”<br/>\n<br/>\nGames Sound Great<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a composer and sound designer for popular video games such as the <br/>\nrecently-released “Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb,” Bajakian has thought plenty <br/>\nabout music’s role in the fast-evolving game industry. Video games have <br/>\nblasted out from the shadow of film, their erstwhile big brother, and composers now <br/>\nhave a slew of advanced tools with which to craft game environments as rich <br/>\nto the ear as they are to the eye.<br/>\n<br/>\n“In the entertainment industry,” says Bajakian, “what drives development is <br/>\nprofit. So as games get more popular, people are paying more attention to <br/>\nsoundtracks, and the budgets for authoring game music have reached revolutionary <br/>\nheights.”<br/>\n<br/>\nCompetition with film plays a role in giving composers more license. <br/>\n“Hollywood set the original expectation for live orchestras,” Bajakian explains. “Ben <br/>\nHur was scored for live orchestra because there was no alternative. Now, game <br/>\nindustry executives want to be as cool as the big film guys by using live <br/>\nmusic. It’s a stamp of arrival, and another way to distinguish their titles. And <br/>\nit’s fortunate for composers like me, because we get to do higher quality <br/>\nmusic.”<br/>\n<br/>\nTechnology has kept up, ensuring that the composer’s artistic decisions are <br/>\nfaithfully transmitted to the gamer. “Game audio used to be significantly lower <br/>\nquality than film or TV,” says Bajakian. “But no more. We’ve left TV in the <br/>\ndust. Now we’re right up there with film industry standards. The new game <br/>\nplatforms have high-resolution audio — better than CD quality — and automatic <br/>\nmixing of dialog, music and effects to Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/pro/audio/bajakian/\">http://www.apple.com/pro/audio/bajakian/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWith musical excerpts you can play if you want.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91698,"nextTopicId":91703}}
