And if a child is writing rules to a game, call <br/>\nthat technical writing.  It is.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some books called &quot;The Transitive Vampire&quot; and &quot;The Well-Tempered <br/>\nSentence&quot; by Karen Elizabeth Gordon which go through such rules in a fun way. <br/>\n I use those, or Fowler&#39;s Modern English Useage when I want to look something <br/>\nup.  The Harbrace College Handbook can probably be found used at just about <br/>\nany used bookstore (as can Fowler&#39;s, maybe, and the older editions of <br/>\nFowler&#39;s are really fun for people interested in English).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut cheap and fun are the sarcastic lists of rules, each of which breaks its <br/>\nown rule.  They go around as e-mail humor sometimes, so lots are on webpages. <br/>\n I quoted a really long one below, but here are links to some shorter <br/>\nversions.  If you lose these, go to google.com and put in &quot;don&#39;t use no <br/>\ndouble negatives never&quot; and you&#39;ll get lots of links.<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Bistro/4611/goodwriting.html\">http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Bistro/4611/goodwriting.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.csh.rit.edu/~kenny/misc/grammar.html\">http://www.csh.rit.edu/~kenny/misc/grammar.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mapping.com/never2.html\">http://www.mapping.com/never2.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHUMOROUS GRAMMAR RULES<br/>\n1. Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.<br/>\n2. Never use a preposition to end a sentence with. Winston Churchill, <br/>\ncorrected on this error once, responded to the young man who corrected him by <br/>\nsaying &quot;Young man, that is the kind of impudence up with which I will not put!<br/>\n3. And don&#39;t start a sentence with a conjunction.<br/>\n4. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br/>\n5. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They&#39;re old hat.)<br/>\n6. Also, always avoid annoying alliteration.<br/>\n7. Be more or less specific.<br/>\n8. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.<br/>\n9. Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies endlessly over and over <br/>\nagain<br/>\n10. No sentence fragments.<br/>\n11. Contractions aren&#39;t always necessary and shouldn&#39;t be used to excess so <br/>\ndon’t.<br/>\n12. Foreign words and phrases are not always apropos.<br/>\n13. Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it&#39;s highly <br/>\nsuperfluous and can be excessive<br/>\n14. All generalizations are bad.<br/>\n15. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br/>\n16. Don&#39;t use no double negatives.<br/>\n17. Avoid excessive use of ampersands & abbrevs., etc.<br/>\n18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br/>\n19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake (Unless they are as <br/>\ngood as gold).<br/>\n20. The passive voice is to be ignored.<br/>\n21. Eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. Parenthetical words, however, <br/>\nshould be enclosed in commas.<br/>\n22. Never use a big word when substituting a diminutive one would suffice.<br/>\n23. Don’t overuse exclamation points!!!<br/>\n24. Use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.<br/>\n25. Understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth earth-shaking <br/>\nideas<br/>\n26. Use the apostrophe in it&#39;s proper place and omit it when its not needed <br/>\nand use it correctly with words’ that show possession.<br/>\n27. Don’t use too many quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, &quot;I hate <br/>\nquotations.. Tell me what you know.&quot;<br/>\n28. If you&#39;ve heard it once, you&#39;ve heard it a billion times: Resist <br/>\nhyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly. Besides, <br/>\nhyperbole is always overdone, anyway.<br/>\n29. Puns are for children, not groan readers.<br/>\n30. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.<br/>\n31. Even IF a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.<br/>\n32. Who needs rhetorical questions? However, what if there were no rhetorical <br/>\nquestions?<br/>\n33. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.<br/>\n34. Avoid &quot;buzz-words&quot;; such integrated transitional scenarios complicate <br/>\nsimplistic matters<br/>\n35. People don’t spell &quot;a lot&quot; correctly alot of the time.<br/>\n36. Each person should use their possessive pronouns correctly<br/>\n37. All grammar and spelling rules have exceptions (with a few exceptions)<br/>\n....Morgan’s Law.<br/>\n38. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.<br/>\n39. The dash – a sometimes useful punctuation mark – can often be overused – <br/>\neven though it’s a helpful tool some of the time.<br/>\n40. Proofread carefully to make sure you don’t repeat repeat any words.<br/>\n41. In writing, it’s important to remember that dangling sentences.<br/>\n41. When numbering in a written document, check your numbering system <br/>\ncarefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n42. It is important to use italics for emphasis sparingly.<br/>\n43. In good writing, for good reasons, under normal circumstances, whenever <br/>\nyou can, use prepositional phrases in limited numbers and with great caution.<br/>\n44. Avoid going out on tangents unrelated to your subject -- not the subject <br/>\nof a sentence -- that&#39;s another story (like the stories written by Ernest <br/>\nHemingway, who by the way wrote the great fisherman story The Old Man and the <br/>\nSea).<br/>\n45. Complete sentences. Like rule 10.<br/>\n46. Unless you&#39;re a righteous expert don&#39;t try to be too cool with slang to <br/>\nwhich you&#39;re not hip.<br/>\n47. If you must use slang, avoid out-of-date slang. Right on!<br/>\n48. You&#39;ll look poorly if you misuse adverbs.<br/>\n49. Use the ellipsis ( . . . ) to indicate missing . . . <br/>\n50. Use brackets to indicate that you [ not Shakespeare, for example ] are <br/>\ngiving people [ in your class ] information so that they [ the people in your <br/>\nclass ] know about whom you are speaking. But do not use brackets when making <br/>\nthese references [ to other authors ] excessively.<br/>\n51. Note: People just can&#39;t stomach too much use of the colon.<br/>\n52. Between good grammar and bad grammar, good grammar is the best.<br/>\n53. There are so many great grammar rules that I can&#39;t decide between them.<br/>\n54. In English, unlike German, the verb early in the sentence, not later, <br/>\nshould be placed.<br/>\n55. When you write sentences, shifting verb tense is bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra,<br/>\nwho has always loved writing, and who used to long ago teach English <br/>\n(bonus split infinitive in the line above)<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93349703,"authorName":"Lilly","from":"Lilly &lt;hazy_lilly@...&gt;","profile":"hazy_lilly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: grammer","postDate":"1016454596","msgId":32575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzE4MTIyOTU2LjE0MjQ1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MTAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGE3M3BlcithdTMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32570,"nextInTopic":32604,"prevInTime":32574,"nextInTime":32576,"topicId":32434,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for all the grammer responses.

If they need to know what something is they ask, I tell them.   After I tell them once or twice they get it and don&#39;t ask anymore.  Rarely when reading a book do I feel the need to identify parts of speech.  Much less diagram a sentence.  Have&#39;nt done that since high school and not sure why it was required then.  Overall my kids learn proper english by communicating with others and reading and being read to.  When they write things (cards, notes, stories) they usually ask me to read it through.  They WANT it to be right.  I suggest changes and most times explain why.  They often tend to remember that mistake next time.  What kid does not mispell things, or word a sentence badly?  It is all part of learning this crazy english language.  Only I think we are doing it the easy, natural way.  And yes my daughter can pass the State required test.
