","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1149506555\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been lurking for a few weeks, my name is April.  I have two ds&#39;s 3 and <br/>\n5 (and one on the way!)  I also run a licensed childcare from my home.  <br/>\nAnyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my questions is about the dads.  How do the dads handle the <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; idea.  My dh was very open to the idea of homeschooling, he has <br/>\na sister that hs&#39;s her six children.  But, she is very structured.  I think <br/>\nthat this is what he expects, sort of a mini school.  I started off trying to <br/>\nbe that way with my ds this year, but never felt that comfortable.  I started <br/>\nhearing about unschooling and reading about it.  I feel more comfortable <br/>\nsomewhere in the middle.  Not too structured, but with some use of <br/>\ncurriculum, like Saxon math, that I use loosely.  My dh does not seem to be <br/>\ntoo comfortable with this idea.  He feels that if I never &quot;teach&quot; him <br/>\nanything, that he will never learn.  Dh wants to see physical work, like <br/>\nworkbooks or pages of writing.  I think that he is stuck on the idea that I <br/>\ncan turn our son into a genius, lol.  So, does anyone have any good ideas on <br/>\nhow to deschool my dh?  How can we meet in the middle?  Has anyone had this <br/>\nexperience before?<br/>\nApril</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15154,"nextTopicId":15087}}
