I like the Astro or Safari&#39;s. <br/>\n Even better an Expedition. ( Ohh just dreaming.......)  Robyn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You sound just like me, Robyn.  I&#39;m 38 with 7 children.  We have a big old <br/>\nfull-size Chevy van.  But, I repeat, it&#39;s VERY OLD and the driver&#39;s side <br/>\nfloorboard is rusting through and it has over 140K miles.  So, we&#39;re looking <br/>\ntoo but everything is SOOO expensive and I hate pouring a lot of resources <br/>\ninto a vehicle!  But, I guess it&#39;s a necessary evil.  Especially when you <br/>\nlive in a rural area, like we do.  We also have a Honda Civic for commuting <br/>\nwhich gets used a lot more than the van!  Take care!<br/>\nCarol from WI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8299,"nextTopicId":8316}}
