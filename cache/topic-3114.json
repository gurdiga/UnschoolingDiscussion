I know that my job has enabled me to stay at <br/>\nhome, and homeschool, and still make money, so I&#39;ll share here.  I do legal <br/>\ntranscription.  I work for one person who has a couple of us doing the <br/>\ntyping.  He gets the work from the courts on tape, sets it up, and gives it <br/>\nto me to type up.  Then I return the finished work on diskette and he takes <br/>\ncare of printing it out in final and forwarding it to the right people.  For <br/>\nwhat I do, I get paid $1.25 per page for Federal Court work.  When we have a <br/>\nrush job, or corporate work, I can make more.
