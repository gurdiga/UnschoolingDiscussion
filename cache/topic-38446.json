(my boys are<br/>\n9 & 11)<br/>\nI remember my mom always did laundry for us this way, sometimes I helped,<br/>\nsometimes I didn&#39;t.<br/>\nMaybe at some point I&#39;ll suggest that my boys start doing some of their own<br/>\nlaundry, but there may be a problem with that. They have so few clothes that<br/>\nbefore they could justify doing a full load of laundry, they&#39;d probably have<br/>\nrun out of clothes to wear a long time ago! Especially a load of whites and<br/>\neven pants/shorts.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know - I just see doing laundry as one of my &quot;mom&quot; jobs.<br/>\nHope I&#39;m not &quot;spoiling&quot; my boys, maybe I&#39;ll feel differently as they get<br/>\nolder, but for now *I* make sure they have clean clothes to wear.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Debra Kattler&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra@...\">debra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Is this really a natural consequence?

Kirby&#39;s socks have not been in any of these <br/>\nfive loads of laundry!&quot; then it would be malice and entrapment on my part.  <br/>\nBut I do most of the laundry, and I do it as it piles up on the floor by the <br/>\nwasher.  There&#39;s a laundry chute from upstairs.  The kids bring laundry when <br/>\nthey want to, it gets washed, dried, put on the couch downstairs, and maybe <br/>\nfolded and re-delivered.  If through all of that ongoing repeating monotonous <br/>\nprocess one kid has gone a week without putting anything in the laundry room, <br/>\nI&#39;m not tracking that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were little it was my job to put their dirty clothes in the right <br/>\nplace, because I was the one who helped them change clothes.  At 15 and 13 I <br/>\ndon&#39;t make them do all their own laundry (sometimes they help, sometimes they <br/>\ndo some), but neither do I remind them regularly, nor do I &quot;punish&quot; them.  <br/>\nBut if their socks are all gone, it&#39;s because their socks are still in their <br/>\nroom and were not by the washing machine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI see no reason to withhold privileges from them in addition to being the <br/>\nwasherwoman.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38454,"nextTopicId":38460}}
