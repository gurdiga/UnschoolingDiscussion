One HS group here meets every other week at <br/>\nCiCi&#39;s pizza. You should post them in &quot;alternative&quot; stores and <br/>\nbusinesses---health food stores and restaurants, massage therapists, <br/>\nhomeopaths, chiropractors. Some libraries allow private posts (ours doesn&#39;t). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many unschoolers/relaxed homeschoolers that don&#39;t visit these lists <br/>\nor the boards. We see it all the time: &quot;I&#39;ve been unschooling for years and <br/>\njust found this site...I&#39;m so glad to have found you...I didn&#39;t realize there <br/>\nwas a name for what we do...&quot;  You may need to search them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a nationwide HS network---Ren can probably give you the <br/>\nsite---where people register. They&#39;re listed by zipcode, I believe. It&#39;ll <br/>\ngive what method of homeschooling they follow and ages of children (?). Other <br/>\nthings. I&#39;ve registered. Many here have. A good way to connect with other <br/>\nunschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110278425,"authorName":"littletoads2000 &lt;shaffert@msu.edu&gt;","from":"&quot;littletoads2000 &lt;shaffert@...&gt;&quot; &lt;shaffert@...&gt;","profile":"littletoads2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Lansing Michigan","postDate":"1042294059","msgId":54301,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF2cDhmYit0anA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54309,"prevInTime":54300,"nextInTime":54302,"topicId":54301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We re looking for unschoolers in the Lansing area.
