He’d <br/>\nbe<br/>\nthrilled to take anyone who wanted to go on a side trip to the San  Juan for<br/>\nfly-fishing and back country camping.  He’s also a New Mexico  history book<br/>\nin his own right, not to mention a master furniture maker with a  fully<br/>\nequipped shop just down the road from Old Town.  Think of the,  what do you<br/>\ncall them—funshop-- opportunities?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing local furniture-making would be a fantastic thing to offer  <br/>\nout-of-towners!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=--- And, lest we forget, Frontier cinnamon rolls!  I think we could  fit<br/>\nabout, oh, several hundred or so in our van!-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nAt Sandia Prep (where Holly and I were on Tuesday) they have a nice  <br/>\ncafeteria,and one of the menu items is Frontier rolls!  (For non-locals,  Frontier <br/>\nRestaurant is a place across from the university that&#39;s been there  since the <br/>\n60&#39;s, and has a butter-drenched cinnamon roll that&#39;s unlike anything  I&#39;ve had <br/>\nanywhere else ever.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd Mo Palmer, our old next door neighbor (still lives next door to our old  <br/>\nhouse) was the city&#39;s photo archivist for years and years, until she went to  <br/>\nteach New Mexico history at Sandia Prep.  I bet she would come and give a  <br/>\nwalking tour of Old Town for the conference.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105762,"nextTopicId":105739}}
