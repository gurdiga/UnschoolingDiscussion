My kids went to public<br/>\nschool for a long time and i finally pulled them out<br/>\nbecause i did not like alot of things that were going<br/>\non. my oldest daughte thought it was okay not to come<br/>\nhome from school because her friends didn&#39;t have too.<br/>\nand my second son just did not like school period. he<br/>\ndid not do any of his work and i was always going to<br/>\nthat school for him. My third child was always getting<br/>\ninto trouble at school. like he refused to go to<br/>\nanouther class for detention and so fourth. with him<br/>\nthe main reason i pulled him is because i was at his<br/>\nschool two or three times a day. when he as in<br/>\nkindergarten he got kicked out of school for three<br/>\ndays for spreading germs, in first grade he told his<br/>\nteacher that he didn&#39;t want to do an assignment and<br/>\nshe yelled at him and he yelled back so he got into<br/>\ntrouble. in third grade he got into trouble again (by<br/>\nthis time he was becomming a big boy) by breaking his<br/>\npencils and not wanting to sit still. The got tired of<br/>\nhim because he just blew up. ( didn&#39;t hurt or touch<br/>\nanyone but started yelling and cussing at them after<br/>\nthey grabbed him by the arms trying to move him from<br/>\none room to anouther) well they gave up on that and<br/>\nhad him arrested. with handcuffs and all. (all over<br/>\nbreaking a pencil and not wanting to sit still and not<br/>\nfollowing their rules) fourth grade they just pretty<br/>\nmuch called me all day telling me what he is doing.<br/>\none time he went into the boys bathroom at school and<br/>\nrefused to come out. so they sent in my daughter. it<br/>\njust went down hill after that. he is in the sixth<br/>\ngrade now. My question is my sons. they want to play<br/>\nviedo games all day long and not do anything else. no<br/>\nchores, no picking up after them selves and so on.<br/>\nwhat do you guys suggest as an alturnative to what i<br/>\nam doing now. im on a budget. thanks nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGod Bless You<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104318,"nextTopicId":104336}}
