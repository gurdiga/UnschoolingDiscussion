I wanted to <br/>\ne-mail you privately, but I have lost your e-mail addy.  My husband and I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe that you sent payment and a gift!  It didn&#39;t cost much at <br/>\nall to send you those game instructions, so payment was unnecessary.  We were <br/>\nglad to do it!!  <br/>\n      Your thanks was already enough to warm my heart, so I cannot tell you <br/>\nhow much your gift meant to me.  I am sometimes overwhelmed by the loving <br/>\ngestures of people in this world (that is usually so uncaring and sometimes <br/>\ncruel.)  You have made me realise that there are still alot of wonderful <br/>\npeople out there.  Thank you so much for taking the extra time, effort and <br/>\nmoney to send your token of appreciation to me.  It is now my turn to show <br/>\nyou some appreciation, so I just wanted to say a very deep and heartfelt Thank<br/>\n you!<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4077,"nextTopicId":4083}}
