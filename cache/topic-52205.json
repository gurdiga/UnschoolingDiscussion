They have all the<br/>\n&gt; new fiction but nonfiction would be another thing.   For example,  I couldn&#39;t get The Continuum Concept, so I<br/>\n&gt; ordered that one.     If I could be connected up with Minnespolis/St. Paul I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t have a problem.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if I dare go through amazon again with that book,    maybe I&#39;d have a better chance going through<br/>\n&gt; the used side?
