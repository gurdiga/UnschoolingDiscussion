Quoting something Sandra said,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1448137991\">I emailed this an hour ago and it didn&#39;t show up, if it does twice, <br/>\nmy apologies.......posting on the website this time......<br/>\n<br/>\nQuoting something Sandra said, about how she helps families. The <br/>\nshift going on in our family is really powerful. My 10yo Megan and I <br/>\nhave had some really cool discussions lately. My mom loved me, but <br/>\nwas never there for me in this capacity. I am so thankful for these <br/>\nconversations between my daughter and me. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of good ones in the car on the way somewhere, she has said she <br/>\nwishes we could spend all the time in the car because we get along <br/>\nbest and talk so much. Some good ones have been coming at the end of <br/>\nan argument that would usually not stop like this before. In other <br/>\nwords, I would stew for a long period of time and not be able to let <br/>\ngo of my anger, and the opportunities for talking it out never <br/>\nhappened. I still struggle with this. It&#39;s hard to stop focusing on <br/>\nmy own feelings to be there and listen and talk with my daughter. <br/>\nIt&#39;s changing, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were talking today after she said something that hurt my feelings <br/>\nand I got really mad and defensive. She said she hadn&#39;t meant it. I <br/>\ntold her of course she meant it, and she said NO. She said &quot;my mouth <br/>\nis an early riser and my mind sometimes sleeps in.&quot; She said why is <br/>\nit that I(mom) could do something or say something and apologize and <br/>\nget forgiveness, but she couldn&#39;t? It froze me in my tracks. She is <br/>\nso right about so many things, it just floors me. I have had to <br/>\nhumble myself to her more than once when she sees me being a <br/>\nhypocrite.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were also talking about she gets upset and starts feeling like she <br/>\nis always wrong and doesn&#39;t do anything right. She always thinks I am <br/>\nright about everything and loves to prove me wrong. I told her I&#39;m <br/>\nnot and she has, and it makes us closer, if we&#39;re honest. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said she wants to be an adult, and know everything. I told her I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know everything, I make big mistakes (the whole school portion <br/>\nof her life), and I think it&#39;s more important to learn about what <br/>\nthrills her and know how to find the answer to anything else, and how <br/>\nto learn from mistakes and not pretend to know everything and always <br/>\nbe right. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about how lots of kids want to be grown up, because it <br/>\nwould mean they have some control of their life. Instead, they exert <br/>\ntheir power on other kids to try to feel like they are in control. <br/>\nShe is very familiar with that. And we were able to say that she is <br/>\nas close to being in contol of her life as possible, as close to <br/>\nbeing a grown up, without the worries and fears that children don&#39;t <br/>\nrealize adults have. By being unschooled and living and learning and <br/>\nsleeping and eating all by her own choosing. Mom still needing to let <br/>\ngo even more, but a long way we&#39;ve come.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said she wishes I would never say &quot;no&quot;, but knows that isn&#39;t <br/>\nrealistic. I say &quot;no&quot; a lot less than I used to, because I am not <br/>\ntrying to control her as much. I try to say &quot;yes&quot; more and more, <br/>\nwhich is the opposite of the way I used to be. I used to be <br/>\ncontrolling and punitive all the time, demanding to know who she <br/>\nthinks she is (caught myself saying it again the other day-- i hate <br/>\nthat), how dare she try to be an equal to her father and I, she <br/>\nshould know her place, blah blah blah. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t like that so much anymore. I now know she is practicing for <br/>\nthe time when she is on her own. She needs not do as I say, not as I <br/>\ndo. I am modelling behavior for my kids, and never quite realized the <br/>\nimpact before. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I wish I didn&#39;t have to come from negativity on our journey to <br/>\npeace, it is amazing the DUH moments that I get along the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for everyone involved in my unschooling journey, helping heal <br/>\nyears of negativity and celebrating peace. <br/>\n<br/>\nAng</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69256,"nextTopicId":69259}}
