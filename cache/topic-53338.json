In actual practice, too many posts makes<br/>\nthe list unusable. And I mean that literally. The month Ned was here, there<br/>\nwere 4086 posts. That&#39;s over 130 posts a day assuming they were all evenly<br/>\ndistributed. Even if I drop the months that were below 1000, the average for<br/>\nthis list is just over 2000 a month. And at that level it&#39;s considered a<br/>\nvery busy list. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far the criteria for making the ban decision isn&#39;t based on what ideas<br/>\nsomeone has but on whether the list can continue to be what people signed on<br/>\nfor. Yes, of course, the list isn&#39;t going to cease functioning because<br/>\nsomeone agrees with everyone! It&#39;s going to be because of incompatible<br/>\nideas. Incompatible ideas are great fodder for debate! Debate is a *good*<br/>\nthing. It creates an atmosphere for people to work hard at making their<br/>\nideas crystal clear so others can understand. But there is good productive<br/>\ndebate and there is disruptive debate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where does the line get drawn? Is the purpose of this list a forum for<br/>\nfree debate or a forum to gain ideas from? Hopefully both! But if the<br/>\nfreedom to speak makes the list unusable to gain ideas from, what purpose is<br/>\nthe list serving?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was some great discussion while Ned was here. His ideas instigated a<br/>\nphonics debate, something that many people may not have been involved in<br/>\nbefore.

To me that<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the case here. The quality was different. Ned appeared to neither<br/>\nrespond to the opposing ideas nor to the objections to his ideas. He<br/>\nattacked people personally and basically just repeated what he&#39;d said before<br/>\nas though others just weren&#39;t listening to him. The thinking it prompted at<br/>\nthe beginning was great. But it devolved into repeating those thoughts over<br/>\nand over and over and was noise filling up people&#39;s mail boxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen&#39;s take may be different than that.
