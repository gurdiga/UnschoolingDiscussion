Yes, all with HUGE backpacks, some using those little luggage carts (mostly mid-school kids).  I&#39;m always amazed to see little kids -- 6 or 7yo  -- walking in groups on the way home.  They look so small and lost.  I remember when we brieflyconsidered sending Andy to kindergarten, thinking it kinda odd that they have a separate, fenced playground for the kindergarten kids -- keeping them away from the older kids.  I had to wonder what kind of atmosphere it was that they felt the need to segregate that way.  More worrisome, that after only one year (and not much physical growth) they&#39;d be out there on a playground with much bigger kids and only a few teachers to supervise.  Yikes!<br/>\n <br/>\nJenny, we saw the seismograph last week at the museum -- it was really impressive just to see how big it was, and to see the sections before, as it built towards the big quake.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

So we finished the year and then summer <br/>\nflew by and the dreaded reporting came again and I felt alone and a little <br/>\nscared.  Which was strange because he and his brother have been home with me all <br/>\nalong except for a short time in childcare when I worked in the same school.  <br/>\nI am terrified that I may be ruining his future but then I see how happy he <br/>\nis and varied his interests are.  So we did it!!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is time we can savor and can never get back at the same time, so I think <br/>\nthat makes all the twinges of fear go away.  I knew this was &quot;right&quot; <br/>\nsomewhere inside and I always have and now that we are in the midst of it, I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine life any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I miss the &quot;normality&quot; of the PTA moms, school events, and such.  I <br/>\nworry that he feels different when he&#39;s with the boys in Tiger Cubs-they all <br/>\ngo to school.  But then I remember those are far and few between events and <br/>\nthat we have so much more to fill up all the other times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel like it&#39;s right, live for the now and have a fabulous time.  <br/>\nAlways think of the things you&#39;ve gained and not of the things you &quot;might&quot; have <br/>\nmissed.  You&#39;ll love this time.  Even if you ever do school again, this is time <br/>\nyou&#39;ll cherish forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am completely alone here in VA :o)  But this list is amazing and that <br/>\nhelps!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Started Unschooling","postDate":"1106282993","msgId":102722,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUzQkFBNTVDLTZCNjctMTFEOS05N0Y4LTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxRjA4NzRCLjcwMTAyMDFAc2lvLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGNzcG0wNytvOWVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDFGMDg3NEIuNzAxMDIwMUBzaW8ubWlkY28ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":102721,"nextInTopic":102724,"prevInTime":102721,"nextInTime":102723,"topicId":102716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Where in Texas are you?

Recognizing that school-think in my own head and NOT acting upon <br/>\nit is a big part of my own deschooling process.  One month per year in <br/>\nschool... I&#39;ve still got a way to go &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nFear of failing?  Welcome to parenthood!  It&#39;s all choices, choices, <br/>\nchoices... Do your best with what you know *right now*  - if that is <br/>\nkeeping your daughter home and unschooling with her, then that&#39;s what <br/>\nyou should do and where your focus should be.  I say enjoy the NOW, the <br/>\nlater will be taken care of when it eventually becomes your NOW :)  This <br/>\nis the only time -ever- you will have *this* joyful 6 year old soul in <br/>\nyour care: cherish it, appreciate it, revel in it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I dont know any other unschooling mothers in this area and feel <br/>\n&gt;really alone.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most of us here can relate to this one... again, it&#39;s a pit of mixed <br/>\nfeelings (some days I /SO/ long to be the normal, mainstream mama), <br/>\ncalmed by the results - my kids are amazing humans, I must be doing <br/>\n/something/ right &lt;vbg&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck tomorrow!  :) diana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46313044,"authorName":"Faerie","from":"&quot;Faerie&quot; &lt;faerieotrouble@...&gt;","profile":"faerieotrouble","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Started Unschooling","postDate":"1106271047","msgId":102716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNzcG0wNytvOWVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":102721,"prevInTime":102715,"nextInTime":102717,"topicId":102716,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m Brenda and after giving unschooling alot of thought over the past months started just this past Monday with my 6-year-old Daughter Bre Anda.
