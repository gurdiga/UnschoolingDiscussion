I&#39;ve been through much the same <br/>\nscenario with my son, except that he didn&#39;t seem to want to learn.  He <br/>\ncertainly never asked for help, but I often wondered if that was because he <br/>\nhad already decided that he was &quot;too stupid&quot; to learn it.  (Yes, even <br/>\nunschooled kids can end up feeling stupid when they have trouble learning <br/>\nsomething.)  In fact, the main reason I panicked and decided to push him <br/>\n(at age 12) was because someone told me about an unschooling family that <br/>\ndiscovered all their children were dyslexic when the oldest was 14.  The <br/>\nmother had felt guilty about not trying to do something about it earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t know the answer.  The testing for dyslexia is very expensive, <br/>\nand my son doesn&#39;t want to go through it anyway.  For the last few months, <br/>\nI&#39;ve just let him be, and I got more support for doing that here.  He does <br/>\nseem to be able to read his bike magazines and web pages about bikes.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t read anywhere near fast enough to read novels.  I would just assume <br/>\nhe was more interested in non-fiction, but he still loves to have novels <br/>\nread to him.
