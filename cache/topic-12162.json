The ONLY time I have ever been asked to show my diploma to<br/>\nANYone for ANY reason was the local school administration office here in<br/>\nClovis, NM when I renewed my homeschool paper work last year. They said they<br/>\nneeded to see my high school diploma, since the law requires that you be a<br/>\nhigh school graduate in order to homeschool your kids in NM. I just told<br/>\nthem that it was at home somewhere, and I would bring it in later. But I<br/>\nnever brought it back in. It has been almost 25 years since I graduated from<br/>\nhigh school and no one else has EVER asked to see it. I have no idea where<br/>\nit even is. I haven&#39;t looked at it once since I got it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] diplomas","postDate":"1020963663","msgId":36930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDUwOTA5NTkxMi4wMjk3NjgzMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDNjLjFlMDFlZTFkLjJhMGJmZjMzQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36921,"nextInTopic":36939,"prevInTime":36929,"nextInTime":36931,"topicId":12162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
