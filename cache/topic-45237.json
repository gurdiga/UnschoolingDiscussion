Then I said they both slept <br/>\n&gt; through<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the night starting at two months, and everyone jumped in about how I <br/>\n&gt; must<br/>\n&gt; &gt;have let them cry til they just gave up and slept (not true) and <br/>\n&gt; about how<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I dehydrated them, and several other things I don&#39;t remember now. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;leader just sat there quietly frowning at me after the others started <br/>\n&gt; in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Three of them were in agreement that I wouldn&#39;t have enough <br/>\n&gt; dedication to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;nurse my new baby, and insinuated that I was wasting their time by <br/>\n&gt; coming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m glad to hear not everyone&#39;s like they were!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Myranda<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that is such a shame, Myranda. You must have felt really crappy <br/>\n&gt; leaving<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that Meeting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I must add that I have been attending Meetings for 23 years ( yes,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   years) and have not ever seen anything even remotely like that <br/>\n&gt; take place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I have seen some women, who are so excited and passionate about their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   babies, get more than a bit boisterous about the benefits of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   breastfeeding. These are women who attend Meetings and a Leader never<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   knows what the make -up of a Meeting will be as they are open to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   It is the LLL Leaders&#39; responsibility to lead the Meeting in such <br/>\n&gt; a way<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   that everyone&#39;s needs are met. Much easier said than done! but LLLI<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Philosophy is certainly accepting of every woman&#39;s choices.  Leaders<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   study a long time, attend sessions on communication skills, keep their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   knowledge of research current, all on a volunteer basis, in order to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   *prevent* what happened during the Meeting you attended.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Most of the women in the local Groups here are working Moms and some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   have chosen to supplement with formula during their absences. I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   seen many single mothers whose babies spent time with their <br/>\n&gt; fathers away<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   from mom...women who nursed one twin and not the other.....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   There are as many situations as there are babies; yet each Mother is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   always treated with respect. *You* know what is best for your <br/>\n&gt; family and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   you should not have been judged in any way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I am so sorry that you had that experience....I can guarantee you <br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   not be treated that way at any Meeting near me. and it is likely that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   you could have returned to that Group and met with an entirely <br/>\n&gt; different<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   gathering of Mothers and had the wonderful experience most people have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   when they find LLL. I distinctly remember the first time I <br/>\n&gt; attended one-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I was pregnant with my 2nd, had weaned the first  early ... no one <br/>\n&gt; said<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   a word about my past experiences but they did offer vast amounts of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   information that made my breastfeeding relationship with the new baby<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   wonderful.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   La Leche League is the &#39;World&#39;s Foremost Authority &#39; on <br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   hope you will use the information the organization has available <br/>\n&gt; if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   should ever need it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Fondly, Judy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Myranda wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Be careful what you say if you go to their meetings! I formula-fed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; both my boys because I had to work full time. When I had my third<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; baby, I had been staying home for over 4 years, so I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; breastfeed her. I went to a meeting.... they asked about how I&#39;d fed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; the boys, and I told them. The rest of the meeting was spent <br/>\n&gt; with them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; attacking my choices and telling me what a bad mom I was. Absolutely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; no support for me wanting to breastfeed now, no help or advice,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; nothing. Just criticism for past choices.

I went to a meeting.... they asked about how I&#39;d fed <br/>\n&gt; the boys, and I told them. The rest of the meeting was spent with them <br/>\n&gt; attacking my choices and telling me what a bad mom I was. Absolutely <br/>\n&gt; no support for me wanting to breastfeed now, no help or advice, <br/>\n&gt; nothing. Just criticism for past choices. I was almost in tears by the <br/>\n&gt; time I left.<br/>\n&gt; Myranda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   From: Judy<br/>\n&gt;   attending LL Meetings is a must do while pregnant<br/>\n&gt;   and the LLLI website is VERY helpful:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lalecheleague.org/\">http://lalecheleague.org/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
