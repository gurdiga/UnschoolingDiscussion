It <br/>\nseemed every kid was in walking distance of a pile of old bedsprings, <br/>\nappliances, and a car or two (plus steel beer cans, tons of broken glass, <br/>\nrotting gross paper or carboard with centipedes and all kinds of bugs and <br/>\nspiders).    I&#39;ve told my kids people used to just throw their trash out the <br/>\nwindows.  I remember the sides of the highways (all those two-lane state <br/>\nhighways there used to be in West Texas and New Mexico that I spent so much <br/>\ntime on in the back of a couple of old Ford stationwagons) would be GLITTERY <br/>\nfrom broken glass.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot long ago we got some old Howdy Doody episodes from Netflix and watched <br/>\nthem.  The best parts were the Twinkie ads, and the last moment of the show.  <br/>\n&quot;Remember kids....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne was &quot;Tell your parents you want to go to Sunday School this Sunday.&quot;<br/>\nOne was telling the kids to take a paper bag the next time they rode in an <br/>\nautomobile, so that people could put trash in the bag instead of throwing it <br/>\nout the window!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was news, but probably the start of people my age saying NO to parents <br/>\nwho casually chucked stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet I was taught by relatives and at church that Jesus was coming soon, it <br/>\nmight be today.   So too much concern for the future was definitely seen as a <br/>\nlack of faith in the return of Jesus.  All that was important was our souls <br/>\nand our faith.  The rest was God&#39;s to clean up by fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64228,"nextTopicId":64239}}
