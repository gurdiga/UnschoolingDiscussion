We went havers with him on a mini video camera for Christmas<br/>\nlast year.  He&#39;s used it some but not very much.  But it turns out there are<br/>\nsome things he needs that we didn&#39;t know about.  Now we&#39;re going to get him<br/>\nwhat he needs to start using it.  Even then, if he doesn&#39;t use it right away<br/>\nwe&#39;re not going to guilt him about it.  We&#39;ll find out if it&#39;s because he<br/>\nstill needs something, whether it&#39;s equipment or help or instruction.  If he<br/>\nstill doesn&#39;t use it, he might prefer to sell it and get something<br/>\ndifferent.
