The <br/>\nlatest food we&#39;ve tried is Nutro Max, which was lower in fiber.  We feed 4 <br/>\ncups a day, which is what the bag suggested for a 60 pound dog.  Previously <br/>\nwe&#39;ve fed him Science Diet, but we later found out it has a lot of corn in it <br/>\nwhich can upset many dogs.  Then we switched to corn-free Canadae, but none <br/>\nof these foods have made a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I&#39;ve heard about the BARF diet, but I would have no clue what to give him. <br/>\n Can anyone give this queasy vegetarian an idea of what Tarzan would need <br/>\neach day?<br/>\n<br/>\n   Thankfully, Tarzan hasn&#39;t gotten into any other animal food,  We have a <br/>\nlot of animals here (3 dogs, three cats, seven frogs, a fish, a rabbit, a <br/>\ncockatiel and a snake!).  But because Tarzan is &quot;enthusiastic,&quot; to put it <br/>\nkindly, he&#39;s an outdoor dog.  He does get hold of things he shouldn&#39;t and <br/>\nchews them up.  He ate part of a doormat one day, and a bit of soccer ball <br/>\nafter that.  Would that account for the mess in the backyard?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all your help.<br/>\nCarol  (By the way, is it common for cats to drool?  One of our cats just <br/>\ndrools buckets when she&#39;s happy.  She&#39;s such a love, and very much a lap cat, <br/>\nbut holding her gets a bit damp after a while!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Way OT dog question","postDate":"1047589337","msgId":61010,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNzBGMUQ5LkJFOEJERjI1QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDkzLjJiYzBmMWE5LjJiYTIyYTBmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":61009,"nextInTopic":61011,"prevInTime":61009,"nextInTime":61011,"topicId":60999,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
