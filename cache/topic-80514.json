I&#39;m a Pagan, and we have a guiding principle that many of us<br/>\nfollow, &quot;Do what you will and harm none.&quot; To me this supports freedom and<br/>\nself-expression as long as we consider the consequences of our actions and<br/>\nrespect the rights of others to their own freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remembered something that happened to me in college which I wanted to<br/>\nshare, as I think it&#39;s relevant to the discussion. My best friend at the<br/>\ntime took me aside and said something on the order of, &quot;You need to stop<br/>\nbeing<br/>\nso bossy, show a little more respect for other people&#39;s space, quit<br/>\ninterrupting when someone else is talking, and<br/>\nlisten to what people are saying to you, or you won&#39;t have too many friends<br/>\nleft!&quot; He also gave specific examples of things I had done and said that<br/>\nwere not respectful or considerate.<br/>\nI cried for two days. I honestly hadn&#39;t had any idea of how my behavior was<br/>\naffecting (alienating!) others.<br/>\nNow I thank him for the pep talk.  He was a true friend (and a gentle soul<br/>\nwho must have been REALLY pissed off to get to the point of needing to speak<br/>\nto me that way). I still talk too much and tend to be bossy, but from that<br/>\nday on I&#39;ve been more aware of the issues I need to deal with. I might have<br/>\nended up pretty lonely if he hadn&#39;t pointed these things out to me.<br/>\n My son is still very little but as he gets older he will need to learn that<br/>\npeople won&#39;t want to be around him unless he<br/>\nrespects their needs as well as his own. And it makes sense to me that that<br/>\nlearning begins with the way we treat each other at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHikaru</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80488,"nextTopicId":80518}}
