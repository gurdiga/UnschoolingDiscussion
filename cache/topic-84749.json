We were<br/>\ngoing to a concert in the evening, and my mother was coming over to go with<br/>\nus.

Ds<br/>\n(15 yo) made the pie crust for dinner (he likes doing that), and dd (11 yo)<br/>\ngot the meat pie filling together (she&#39;s recently gotten interested in<br/>\ncooking and measuring things out).  My mother got here early, while we were<br/>\nin the middle of all this, and by the time I got back inside, she had half<br/>\nthe dishes cleaned up &lt;grin&gt;.  The living room is still a wreck, but it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to hamper our conversation (what little there was before we went<br/>\nout to the concert).
