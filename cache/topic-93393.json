I do this often myself, because my son has &quot;no fear&quot;. He <br/>\ntends to get in precarious situations and even dangerous (to a degree) ones, <br/>\nand sometimes, I just either have to grit my teeth and bite my toungue or turn <br/>\naway and not watch. I used to be similar as a child, and I can remember my <br/>\nmother&#39;s constant warnings and written instructions on every field trip <br/>\npermission slip, and often wonder if it made me more reckless-after all, if I was going <br/>\nto get hurt ANYWAY, why not do what I want and have fun while I&#39;m doing it? <br/>\nIt didn&#39;t make me any safer, just caused friction between us. So I try to keep <br/>\nmy mouth shut and give Wyl his freedom unless there is a serious actual threat <br/>\nto his life , eye or limb (as in severed). It is the hardest part of <br/>\nparenting-and something I never imagined before I had a child! LOL How cool that your <br/>\nmom could do that for you!

But I thanked her instead for the <br/>\nhours she spent in the lake with us.  She would put on her swimsuit <br/>\nand swim and play with us all afternoon.  She was the one who showed <br/>\nme how to float.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSee, I found out a couple of years ago that the reason my mom NEVER <br/>\nwent in the water with us was because she knew there were snapping <br/>\nturtles in the water.  She feared one would grab her/our toes and <br/>\nyank us under.  And while it seems illogical that she would allow her <br/>\nchildren to enter the water with such a fear, and she indeed <br/>\nhyperventilated every time we went under water, she never told us <br/>\nabout her fear.  NEVER!  We all swim like fish cause we love to.  We <br/>\n(I have 3 siblings) also all love playing with the kids in the <br/>\nwater.  It makes me appreciate my mom all the more.
