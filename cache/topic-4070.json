It covers just about everything.  I supplement with<br/>\nmath and grammar but other than that there are plenty of activities to<br/>\nchoose from.  For instance, you read a chapter or two in one of the books<br/>\nand there are comprehension questions and about 12-15 activities you can<br/>\npursue.  I can let the kids pick out what they want to do and ignore the<br/>\nrest.  It has been great for us as a back up source for things to do when<br/>\nwe get to a point of not knowing what to do next.  We travel lots of bunny<br/>\ntrails, as I call them, ending up in several mini unit studies that last<br/>\nanywhere from 10 minutes to 10 days or more.  This primer is for 3-6th<br/>\ngrade age levels and is great for both boys and girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargie Gray, the author of Prairie Primer, also has another unit study<br/>\nbased on the Anne of Green Gables series called Where the Brook Meets the<br/>\nRiver.
