Let&#39;s go back to when you first<br/>\nstarted posting here and I was amazed at your unschooling knowledge and<br/>\nexperience that you were sharing with us.<br/>\nWhat has happened to the Ned Vare that I truly respected and admired for<br/>\ngiving out GREAT unschooling advice?<br/>\nIn the past week or two, it seems you have found your political voice here,<br/>\nand I am really missing your unschooling voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that I don&#39;t agree with some of what you&#39;ve been saying recently,<br/>\nbut what am I supposed to do with that information? How can it help me with<br/>\nunschooling my two boys who are 9 & 11?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really impressed me with some of your earlier posts. That was the kind<br/>\nof stuff I&#39;d want to print out and have on hand to give to my MIL when the<br/>\ntime comes and she asks &quot;whadya mean you&#39;re unschooling?&quot;. The old Ned is<br/>\nwho I&#39;m hoping to see at the conference to inspire and encourage me further<br/>\nabout unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill the old Ned please come back? I miss you!<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin in AZ</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40722,"nextTopicId":40735}}
