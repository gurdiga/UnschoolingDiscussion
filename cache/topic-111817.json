We started out with Klick and Play which you can download <br/>\nhere:<br/>\nhttp://www.clickteam.com/English/download_main.php?PID=6<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a free download and a great introduction to programming basics <br/>\nfor the very beginner. He was able to use it when he was 8. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater, we graduated to the Games Factory(found on the same site), <br/>\nwhich gives more options and is a little more advanced. The site also <br/>\nhas installation program creators so that you can can have an install <br/>\nprogram for the games you create. My son used both the install maker <br/>\nand games factory to create games which he burned onto disk and sold <br/>\nto his friends for a dollar. He started his own software company, and <br/>\nsold his games on his website (which he has taken down now).<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, he wanted to do web based games so we got him Flash which he <br/>\nlearned fairly easily after the intros provided by clickteam. It&#39;s a <br/>\nbit pricey, but worth it if your budding developer wants to develop <br/>\nweb based games and is serious. There are tutorials all over the net <br/>\non how to use it.  It can be purchased here:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/flashpro/<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we are looking for an intro into Visual Basic, so if anyone knows <br/>\nof any download sites for the Visual Basic software I&#39;d appreciate it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111814,"nextTopicId":111824}}
