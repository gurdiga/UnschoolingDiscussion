And the more you press, the more likely your ex-wife will draw away from your proselytizing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could talk about your daughter, talk about what you&#39;re discovering. Do it conversationally as you&#39;d share something from work. The less you make it about changing your ex-wife and the more you make it about you and your daughter and sharing a bit of your lives with her, the more she&#39;ll be open to listening. If she feels pressured, she&#39;ll likely shut down.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could read Guerrilla Learning by Grace Llewellyn. It might have some ideas on how to support your son while he&#39;s in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Learning-Education-Without-School-ebook/dp/B00DNL3316/\">http://smile.amazon.com/Guerrilla-Learning-Education-Without-School-ebook/dp/B00DNL3316/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** 1.  We all work full time. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf its working for your daughter, cool. A few kids don&#39;t need much outside input. That&#39;s not the norm, though. I can&#39;t imagine my daughter would have been happy staying without a parent all day. And that would make the 14 yo responsible for your son. No matter how you set it up to minimize that, it just doesn&#39;t sound like a good situation to rely on every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the situation is very different from what I imagine. But it&#39;s something to think about. Life doesn&#39;t become ideal for learning by labeling it &quot;UNSCHOOLING&quot;. Unschooling requires a parent to be responsive to his child&#39;s needs. If your son needs you with him, not 10 minutes away, he needs you with him. Calling it unschooling won&#39;t fix that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** . I don&#39;t see how putting him in a different school will help any of the &quot;school issues&quot; he has. ... (&quot;but their curriculum is stellar&quot; gaaaa.) ***<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she can&#39;t yet see. This may be something she needs to conclude on her own. Yes, it isn&#39;t ideal that your son has to suffer for her to understand. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may help to coach him that he needs to be clear and honest about what&#39;s going on at school, also what he needs and what the school is failing to meet. (Like being able to move.) Subconsciously kids can feel their parents know what&#39;s happening to them at school. And parents can feel that if kids aren&#39;t complaining, then everything is okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***  I don&#39;t want to force him to do some curriculum she decided was best ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you need a better way of communicating if you feel she can decide what you do in your home. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you can come to an agreement where she does the curriculum with him and you do the things you believe will help him learn best. Let her know if she&#39;s assigning work for him to do then it needs done at her house, that you won&#39;t enforce it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you haven&#39;t even gotten to the homeschooling agreement yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":459359078,"authorName":"D.
