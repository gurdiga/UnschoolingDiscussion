Why&#39;d you toss the fluoride<br/>\nfolks overboard?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had just tracked down Dr. Hardy Limeback, B.Sc.,<br/>\nPh.D in Biochemistry,<br/>\nD.D.S., head of the Department of Preventive Dentistry<br/>\nfor the University<br/>\nof Toronto, and president of the Canadian Association<br/>\nfor Dental Research.<br/>\n(Whew.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Limeback is Canada&#39;s leading fluoride authority<br/>\nand, until recently, the<br/>\ncountry&#39;s primary promoter of the controversial<br/>\nadditive. In a surprising<br/>\nnewsmaker interview this past April, Dr. Limeback<br/>\nannounced a dramatic<br/>\nchange of heart.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Children under three should never use fluoridated<br/>\ntoothpaste,&quot; he<br/>\ncounseled. &quot;Or drink fluoridated water. And baby<br/>\nformula must never be<br/>\nmade up using Toronto tap water. Never.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy, I wondered? What could have caused such a<br/>\npowerful paradigm shift?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s been building up for a couple of years,&quot;<br/>\nLimeback told me during a<br/>\nrecent telephone interview. &quot;But certainly the<br/>\ncrowning blow was the<br/>\nrealization that we have been dumping contaminated<br/>\nfluoride into water<br/>\nreservoirs for half a century. The vast majority of<br/>\nall fluoride additives come<br/>\nfrom Tampa Bay, Florida smokestack scrubbers. The<br/>\nadditives are a toxic<br/>\nbyproduct of the super-phosphate fertilizer industry.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Tragically,&quot; he continued, &quot;that means we&#39;re not just<br/>\ndumping toxic fluoride<br/>\ninto our drinking water. We&#39;re also exposing innocent,<br/>\nunsuspecting people<br/>\nto deadly elements of lead, arsenic and radium, all of<br/>\nthem carcinogenic.<br/>\nBecause of the cumulative properties of toxins, the<br/>\ndetrimental effects on<br/>\nhuman health are catastrophic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA recent study at the University of Toronto confirmed<br/>\nDr. Limeback&#39;s worst<br/>\nfears. &quot;Residents of cities that fluoridate have<br/>\ndouble the fluoride in their hip<br/>\nbones vis-a-vis the balance of the population. Worse,<br/>\nwe discovered that<br/>\nfluoride is actually altering the basic architecture<br/>\nof human bones.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSkeletal fluorosis is a debilitating condition that<br/>\noccurs when fluoride<br/>\naccumulates in bones, making them extremely weak and<br/>\nbrittle. The earliest<br/>\nsymptoms?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mottled and brittle teeth,&quot; Dr. Limeback told me. &quot;In<br/>\nCanada we are now<br/>\nspending more money treating dental fluorosis than we<br/>\ndo treating cavities.<br/>\nThat includes my own practice.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most obvious living experiments today, Dr.<br/>\nLimeback believes, is<br/>\na proof-positive comparison between any two Canadian<br/>\ncities. &quot;Here in<br/>\nToronto we&#39;ve been fluoridating for 36 years. Yet<br/>\nVancouver - which has<br/>\nnever fluoridated - has a cavity rate lower than<br/>\nToronto&#39;s.&quot; And, he pointed<br/>\nout, cavity rates are low all across the<br/>\nindustrialized world including Europe,<br/>\nwhich is 98% fluoride free. Low because of improved<br/>\nstandards of living,<br/>\nless refined sugar, regular dental checkups, flossing<br/>\nand frequent brushing.<br/>\nNow less than 2 cavities per child Canada-wide,&quot; he<br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t get it, Doc. Last month, the Centers for<br/>\nDisease Control (CDC) ran<br/>\na puff piece all across America saying the stuff was<br/>\nbetter than sliced bread.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the story?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; he replied, &quot;the CDC is basing its<br/>\nposition on data that is 50<br/>\nyears old, and questionable at best. Absolutely no one<br/>\nhas done research on<br/>\nfluorosilicates, which is the junk they&#39;re dumping<br/>\ninto the drinking water.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;On the other hand,&quot; he added, &quot;the evidence against<br/>\nsystemic fluoride<br/>\nin-take continues to pour in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But Doc, the dentists...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have absolutely no training in toxicity,&quot; he stated<br/>\nfirmly. &quot;Your<br/>\nwell-intentioned dentist is simply following 50 years<br/>\nof misinformation from<br/>\npublic health and the dental association. Me, too.<br/>\nUnfortunately, we were<br/>\nwrong.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, Dr. Hardy Limeback addressed his faculty<br/>\nand students at the<br/>\nUniversity of Toronto, Department of Dentistry. In a<br/>\npoignant, memorable<br/>\nmeeting, he apologized to those gathered before him.<br/>\n&quot;Speaking as the head<br/>\nof preventive dentistry, I told them that I had<br/>\nunintentionally mislead my<br/>\ncolleagues and my students. For the past 15 years, I<br/>\nhad refused to study the<br/>\ntoxicology information that is readily available to<br/>\nanyone. Poisoning our<br/>\nchildren was the furthest thing from my mind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The truth,&quot; he confessed to me, &quot;was a bitter pill to<br/>\nswallow, but swallow it<br/>\nI did.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSouth of the border, the paradigm shift has yet to<br/>\ndawn. After half a century<br/>\nof delusion, the CDC, American Dental Association and<br/>\nPublic Health<br/>\nstubbornly and skillfully continue to manipulate<br/>\npublic opinion in favor of<br/>\nfluoridation. Meantime, study after study is<br/>\ndelivering the death knell of the<br/>\ndeadly toxin. Sure, fluoridation will be around for a<br/>\nlong time yet, but<br/>\nultimately its supporters need to ready the life<br/>\nrafts. The poisonous waters of<br/>\ndoubt and confusion are bound to get choppier.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are lawsuits inevitable?&quot; I asked the good doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Remember tobacco,&quot; was his short, succinct reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome, Dr. Hardy Limeback, to the far side of the<br/>\nfluoride equation. It&#39;s<br/>\nlonely over here, but in our society loneliness and<br/>\ntruth frequently travel<br/>\nhand in hand.
