We packed up our bikes and went over to our<br/>\n&gt; church&#39;s parking lot.  The boys had fun zooming all around, Cal said<br/>\n&gt; he was going 456mph according to his &quot;speed monitor&quot;  LOL..

OH,yeah, I went to the<br/>\n&gt; Dollar store and racked up on lots of cheap gifts I can wrap up for<br/>\n&gt; treats before Christmas OR I can use them for stocking stuffers if<br/>\n&gt; they dont end up opening all of them.  Acutally, Phillip hasnt asked<br/>\n&gt; to open any gifts today, but I did give him some new crayons<br/>\n&gt; with &quot;flesh&quot; color in them to finish coloring Shaggy on his poster.<br/>\n&gt; I gotta go whip up some lunch..

(yes I know that&#39;s<br/>\ndangerous but I think we were both doing fine and under control).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got to the park, it was blissfully empty &lt;g&gt; but we found that they<br/>\nhad a fence around the playground equipment and this truck/tractor thing<br/>\nstarted digging a deep hole. Our guess is that they&#39;re working on putting in<br/>\nnew playground equipment. Anyway, it was fun to watch and at least the<br/>\nswings were available and the boys had fun with that for about a 1/2  hour.<br/>\nThen we cycled home and were almost there when 2 dogs came out of a fenced<br/>\nyard where the gate was open and starting barking at us. Oh, I HATE that! We<br/>\nstopped and stood our ground and when it looked like it was safe and they<br/>\nweren&#39;t going to run after us and attack us, we went on home.
