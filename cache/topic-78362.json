(We even have at least one Canadian,  Marty Layne.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s going to be dizzying array of stuff, including kid and family <br/>\nstuff and informal round table discussions.  (A new addition.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very energizing to be surrounded by masses of enthusiastic <br/>\nhomeschoolers.  For those of us who are too &quot;geographically challenged&quot; <br/>\nto go to the fabulous all unschooling conference in South Carolina, I <br/>\nstrongly recommend the HSC conference in Sacramento.<br/>\n<br/>\nSix more days!<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Conference Details?","postDate":"1060446646","msgId":78365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwMy4zM2VlNjI2OC4yYzY2N2JiNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78362,"nextInTopic":78379,"prevInTime":78364,"nextInTime":78366,"topicId":78362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/9/2003 12:14:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ... http://schoolsoutsupport.org/2003conference.html Totally unschooling conference in Columbia,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-384264589\">In a message dated 8/9/2003 12:14:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ingrid@...\">ingrid@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been off-list for a while.
