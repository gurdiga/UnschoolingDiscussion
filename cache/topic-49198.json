At 22 weeks my doctor informed me the baby was not <br/>\nalive. My choices were to either carry the baby until my body went into<br/>\nlabor <br/>\n(which normally a woman&#39;s body will do, but mine did not.) or to induce<br/>\nand <br/>\ndeliver. If I continued to carry the fetus, I ran the risk of severe <br/>\ninfection. Darin, my Mom, my doctor, and I talked and we decided that I <br/>\nneeded to deliver the baby. I was induced and prepared for an almost<br/>\nnormal <br/>\ndelivery. Five hours into labor, a sonogram showed what hadn&#39;t been<br/>\nevident <br/>\nbefore and my doctor explained that the fetuses head wouldn&#39;t pass<br/>\nthrough <br/>\nand explained what he would have to do.

If the fetus is already dead, they induce labor and deliver the <br/>\nbaby. If the fetus isn&#39;t dead and the health of the mother is at risk or the <br/>\nfetuses head is too large because of hydrocephalous they insert a catheter in <br/>\nthe spinal column to draw out fluid so the head will decrease in size making <br/>\nit easier to extract the fetus. Either way, abortion isn&#39;t and can&#39;t be made <br/>\nnice. I just think that scaring women with ugly pictures and statements that <br/>\nare partial truths isn&#39;t the way to educate and give informative choices. <br/>\nAlthough this site used drawings, there are many sites that use inflammatory <br/>\npictures to get their point across. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetween Moly and Jack, I lost a baby. It was due on my birthday, and I had <br/>\nthis attachment to it that was more intense than the one I had with Moly <br/>\nbefore she was born. At 22 weeks my doctor informed me the baby was not <br/>\nalive. My choices were to either carry the baby until my body went into labor <br/>\n(which normally a woman&#39;s body will do, but mine did not.) or to induce and <br/>\ndeliver. If I continued to carry the fetus, I ran the risk of severe <br/>\ninfection. Darin, my Mom, my doctor, and I talked and we decided that I <br/>\nneeded to deliver the baby. I was induced and prepared for an almost normal <br/>\ndelivery. Five hours into labor, a sonogram showed what hadn&#39;t been evident <br/>\nbefore and my doctor explained that the fetuses head wouldn&#39;t pass through <br/>\nand explained what he would have to do. I was devastated. But I got to hold <br/>\nand love a baby for a while. If my doctor had stabbed the back of my baby&#39;s <br/>\nhead and sucked out the brains as this site describes the procedure, I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have had that time. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast month, I lost twins. This time at 14 weeks. Again, I never went into a <br/>\nnatural labor. Since the fetuses were small enough, I didn&#39;t go through what <br/>\nI went through the first time. I was induced, I delivered and then I had a <br/>\nroutine D&C. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"patti.schmidt2@verizon.net","from":"&lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"partial birth abortion, was old vs. young earth","postDate":"1036551006","msgId":49198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMTA2MDI1MDA2LllZVFQxNDQzLm91dDAxMS52ZXJpem9uLm5ldEBbMTI3LjAuMC4xXT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49204,"prevInTime":49197,"nextInTime":49199,"topicId":49198,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"T***hat is the sickest crap I have seen in a long time.
