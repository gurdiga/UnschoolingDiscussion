Graduated in the top ten in my class. <br/>\nDon&#39;t remember what I learned in history, but remembered <br/>\neverything to the tee from my after school work in the theater. I <br/>\ncan teach theater as an adult but can&#39;t tell you almost anything <br/>\nabout history (what I now know is from historical fiction and good <br/>\nmovies). Unschooling seemed to make sesnse of my <br/>\nexperienceÂ—that learning isn&#39;t what school was about. <br/>\nPerforming is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy grad school professor said something profound during week <br/>\none.

That&#39;s holding back and never risking. But <br/>\nlearning doesn&#39;t happen until you risk and fail and discover <br/>\nanother way.

Some of <br/>\nthe best unschoolers I&#39;ve known used to be teachers and are embarrassed or <br/>\nashamed of things they were forced to do, and of their contribution to &quot;the <br/>\nsystem.&quot;  Another batch of the best unschoolers I&#39;ve noticed are people who really <br/>\nnever liked school in the first place and stopped really cooperating when they <br/>\nwere twelve or so.  Interesting that those two groups have produced lots of <br/>\ngreat unschoolers.

For one thing, it&#39;s risky.  One horse wins; the rest are <br/>\nlosers.  And the winners?  Do they get better food?  Their owners and jockeys <br/>\nget paid, they go back to the stall.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve seen a rash of those bumper stickers lately about &quot;my child was caught <br/>\nbeing good&quot; and &quot;...honor student.&quot;   A kid does well in school, gets a good <br/>\nmark on a little piece of paper (an &quot;A&quot; or a &quot;VG&quot; or an &quot;E&quot; or something which <br/>\nhas no intrinsic value) and their parents might get a bumper sticker.   I took <br/>\npsychology classes in the operant-conditioning days, early 70&#39;s, and we <br/>\ntaught rats to &quot;bar-press&quot; for food pellets.   Some of the pushed the bar five <br/>\ntimes, then food came out.  Some pressed ten.  That kind of conditioning is out of <br/>\nstyle among psychologists, but damned if they&#39;re not still doing it in <br/>\nschools in Albuquerque, for A&#39;s and bumper stickers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7143857,"authorName":"jrossedd@aol.com","from":"jrossedd@...","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Do Teachers Understand Unschooling?","postDate":"1065093284","msgId":81892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Ni4yNjQxM2EzMi4yY2FkNjJhNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":81906,"prevInTime":81891,"nextInTime":81893,"topicId":81892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My experience is more like Pam s, though it s hard to generalize either way.
