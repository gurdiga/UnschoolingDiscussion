I&#39;ve been having a bit <br/>\nof  a struggle...my mom died a year ago about this time, and it&#39;s been a really <br/>\nbusy and hard year for me. The last couple of weeks I&#39;ve been feeling sad and <br/>\nfrustrated, but communicating, I thought, pretty clearly about it. There&#39;s no <br/>\nconstant sadness or depression, and I&#39;m going to take a couple of days away <br/>\nwith my best friend at a hotel where we can swim, jacuzzi, shop, get massages, <br/>\neat good food, and play.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I was overwhelmed and sad, and Julian and I were having trouble <br/>\ndeciding where we wanted to go out to lunch and do after. He suddenly looked so sad, <br/>\nand I asked him why. He said, nothing, he was fine. He clearly wasn&#39;t, and I <br/>\npushed a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started crying, and it came out that he thought it was his fault I was <br/>\nsad. I sat him down on my lap (he is 14 and at least 10 inches taller than me), <br/>\nand explained, specifically about why I&#39;ve been sad, none of which has anything <br/>\nto do with him. He said that since he spends the most time with me that he <br/>\nshould be able to make me not sad. In fact, I explained, his being around me <br/>\nmade the last year pretty wonderful DESPITE all the hard times. We both cried <br/>\n(I&#39;m a cryer), and then we went to Johnny Rockets and had good food and wandered <br/>\naround the mall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like this kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84722,"nextTopicId":84712}}
