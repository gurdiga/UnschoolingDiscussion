But there is a difference <br/>\nbetween a notification letter (letter of intent), which is just a <br/>\nformality, declaring our right to educate our kids at home, and this <br/>\nletter, which should be to suggest something personal, and should be <br/>\nin the words of each particular home educator.  I have offered clear <br/>\nsuggestions and also offered that if folks want to email their <br/>\nletters to me I would be happy to read them and make suggestions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor this letter, it&#39;s the rationale that counts, how well each parent <br/>\nexplains why he or she should be assessing their own, can do it <br/>\nbetter than anyone else coming in for a few minutes or hours once a <br/>\nyear. It should explain how we are, by state regulations, granted the <br/>\nsame privileges as any classroom teacher in all other areas and are <br/>\ncertainly the best suited, best prepared to do this job, and why.  If <br/>\nthis letter is brief (one page), spelled properly, uses good grammar, <br/>\npunctuation, and sentence structure, then, as I said, no one has ever <br/>\nhad this request turned down, so far.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, the regs are written in such a way that theoretically a <br/>\nsuperintendent could turn down this request, if he or she did not <br/>\nagree with your request.  The regs do not spell out what is or is not <br/>\nacceptable for this alternative.  So far no super has done this, but <br/>\nthere are a few humdingers out there, so I know it could happen.  If <br/>\nit ever happened to me I would just keep sending in more suggestions, <br/>\nover and over again, until the super got tired of it and approved one <br/>\nof them.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendation is to write your own letter for this, keep it <br/>\nsimple.  If insecure ask others in e-groups or local support groups <br/>\nto read your letter, see what they think, and then go for it.  Do <br/>\nthis early enough, say early spring, so that if your super should <br/>\nturn you down you can still do other things, like:  make other <br/>\nsuggestions to your superintendent; get the free portfolio assessment <br/>\nwith our group (must join our free group by Jan. 1); or find a <br/>\nprivate OH certified teacher to do your portfolio assessment for a <br/>\nfee; or find a nationally normed achievement test that you are <br/>\nwilling to give your kids, sending in the composite score.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother suggestion I have put out for those who want something <br/>\nconcrete to send their supers (why, I don&#39;t know), would be to do the <br/>\ndetailed outline that some more conservative groups tell their <br/>\nmembers they should do each year, to send in with their notification <br/>\nletter to satisfy the &quot;outline&quot; requested in the state regs.  One <br/>\ncould do this as a kind of end-of-year transcript for each year of <br/>\nhomeschooling. If you don&#39;t mind doing that there are plenty of <br/>\nsources that can provide templates for this type of transcript. And <br/>\nyou will then be in the habit of keeping a transcript which will help <br/>\nfor college entrance later, specifically for the high school years.  <br/>\nI personally do not want to give the super this kind of detail, but <br/>\nothers are doing this annually, and unnecessarily, anyway.  If you&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to do it why not do it at the end of the year to satisfy your <br/>\nassessment, instead of doing it at the beginning of the year.  The <br/>\nstate itself puts out detailed standards guide booklets on &quot;What Is <br/>\nExpected in Grade _____&quot; that could be used for this purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith three relatively simple options, depending on what you prefer, I <br/>\nhope that others will at least try Option #3.  It&#39;s been on the books <br/>\nfor more than 13 years now, but I was the first to try it and found <br/>\nthat my superintendent, who is not really homeschool friendly, did <br/>\nnot even blink, approved it right away.  And has continued to approve <br/>\nit ever since, for six years now.  As I said before, so far everyone <br/>\nwho has tried it has been approved.

Amazing, isn&#39;t it?&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra:<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue.  A lot of people are way too paranoid about the whole portfolio <br/>\nassessment option in Ohio, which is where this topic originated.  As <br/>\nI stated, it is totally up to the teacher.  The form we certified OH <br/>\nteachers sign is very brief, and it requires very little, so <br/>\nthe &quot;unschool friendly&quot; teacher is not going to be looking at much of <br/>\nanything, at all.  But newbies probably panic when they hear members <br/>\nof certain more fundamentalist groups tell them they have to do this, <br/>\nthat, and the other thing.  Just not true.  It is so much simpler <br/>\nthan some folks think it is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as I also clearly stated, there is a third option, which is the <br/>\none I opted for when I moved here from New Mexico.  And that is that <br/>\nyou can do whatever you and your superintendent agree upon.  I just <br/>\nwrote a letter to my super stating that I felt I was the best person <br/>\nto do this portfolio assessment, and explained why, never stating <br/>\nthat I was an OH certified teacher, by the way, just a home educating <br/>\nparent.  What that means is that I get to sign that simple piece of <br/>\npaper myself for my child.  How easy can it get?  People believe <br/>\nmyths about these regs, when all anyone has to do is read them, <br/>\ncarefully, and they will see that they really do not require much at <br/>\nall.  And there is no punishment in this section of the regs, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course there are a few control-freak superintendents in Ohio, and <br/>\nthey do make it their goal in life to harass home educators, but <br/>\nthese home educators just need to hook up with a good support group <br/>\nto find out the truth and stop providing more than the regs require, <br/>\nwhich just hurts the rest of us, opens the door to support <br/>\nlegislation that would seek more control over us all.  What I always <br/>\nsuggest when dealing with these supers is to take a copy of the regs <br/>\nalong, hold it out to them, and ask them to show you just where in <br/>\nthe regs it says whatever they are telling you that you must do.  <br/>\nGets them every time.  Most supers have never read the regs at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;Photocopies worksheets?  Remember when Hansel stuck a chicken bone <br/>\nout so the blind witch could see if he was gaining weight? How sad <br/>\nthat people have to live in those conditions.   I hope that law is <br/>\nchanged before too long.&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe law is not going to be changed anytime soon.  And if it were it <br/>\nwould be as a result of federal intervention, which would probably <br/>\nkeep it tied up in court for a good long while.  No one needs to see <br/>\nphotocopied worksheets, and no one in Ohio submits anything <br/>\nwhatsoever to the schools directly.  The only thing mailed is a <br/>\nnotification letter, telling the school that we are exercising our <br/>\nright to home educate our own children, spitting back the <br/>\nrequirements listed in the regs, saying that we will do what they <br/>\nsay, and asking for a letter excusing us from compulsory attendance.  <br/>\nBut no detail is required whatsoever.  In subsequent years, after the <br/>\nfirst notification we do have to submit one of the three forms of <br/>\nassessment that I listed in my last post.  Three very good options, <br/>\nthat include arranging it with your superintendent that you can do <br/>\nany assessing yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe funniest thing is that even though I have been preaching this <br/>\nthird option for six years now, very few people will even try to take <br/>\nadvantage of it.  All it requires is that the home educating parent <br/>\npresent a simple, good rationale to the super why he or she should be <br/>\nthe one assessing his or her own child.  That&#39;s easy!  Who else would <br/>\nbe better qualified?  If you write a good letter stating your <br/>\nrationale then I have yet to find any super who has refused to allow <br/>\nthe parent to do this.  And all &quot;this&quot; requires is filling in the <br/>\nblanks on a simple form, a few sentences.  So why do folks make it so <br/>\ncomplicated?  Why do they think this is so difficult?  I sure don&#39;t <br/>\nknow.  But I do know that it doesn&#39;t have to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those who are just too terrified to approach their super, <br/>\neven in a letter, then the other two options are avaiable that I <br/>\nlisted earlier.  This is not the best state for home education, but <br/>\nit is also not the worst.  I suggest everyone in every state read <br/>\ntheir regulations carefully, use their own brains, question what they <br/>\nread, and do not just take the word of someone else, or some other <br/>\norganization, especially those known to be rather conservative.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince our group offers free portfolio assessments to all interested <br/>\nmembers, all anyone who doesn&#39;t want to tackle the super has to do is <br/>\nplan ahead for that, join our group free of charge, enjoy the company <br/>\nof other home educators for an afternoon, and that&#39;s that.  How could <br/>\nit be easier?  Well, yes, we could have no assessment requirements, <br/>\nwhich would suit me just fine.  But in a way we have that with the <br/>\nthird option.  Which is the one I use.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;I would move before I would hide or stick out a chicken bone.&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one in Ohio has to hide of stick out a chicken bone.  And if it <br/>\nevery came down to that, I would be the first to move, rest assured.<br/>\nEither to Michigan, or back to New Mexico.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle E.
