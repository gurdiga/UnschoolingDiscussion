My 3 yr old sleeps in  my <br/>\nroom and my 17mo co-sleeps and Im still nursing. I might add he last several  <br/>\nweeks and most of his 17mo nurses a good 50% of my sleep time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 13 yr old has a runescape schedule that has been all night or till 11.  <br/>\nThe 5 yr old is up till midnight most nights though falls asleep earlier if she <br/>\nneeds it. They both sleep until 10ish.  She&#39;s pretty good at night. Last  <br/>\nnight she was in her room changing tv channels. She yelled to the 13 yr old that <br/>\na cartoon was on that was in a comic book (Simpsons?). I cringed as I <br/>\nlistened  to the interact. My son and her have been clashing the past year. She&#39;s so <br/>\nindependent and getting older and it&#39;s hard for him to allow her to be that <br/>\nwhen  he&#39;s been the one for years... Anyway, She said that and he said <br/>\n(nicely) yes,  Cassidy , thank you for telling me. I didn&#39;t realize I was holding my <br/>\nbreath but  I was...<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing that I also am a night owl and often hang out with them after the  baby <br/>\nis asleep I have been lacking sleep. I wake sore,lacking sleep and was  <br/>\nbeginning to feel ill. I think with several children there needs to be a balance  <br/>\nfor husband and wife. With four children it can feel like your being pulled in <br/>\n5  different directions with the end result of wondering where your personal <br/>\ntime  went. For me some nights I need to just go to bed after the kids are all <br/>\nset and  others I stay up to try to catch up with my husband, emails,ebay and  <br/>\nlaundry.  Making time for yourself and your husband is important. I&#39;ve  found <br/>\nthat some things my husband deals with better than I so he brings the 3yr  <br/>\nold to bed, I put the 17mo to bed and we tend to the 13 and 5 yr old in between  <br/>\nand after. I think my older kids stay up later bc they get more one on one <br/>\nthen.  It&#39;s not a simple task to keep everyone happy while your tired but if <br/>\nbalanced  and openly discussed you can lower the frustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand having several children who are of differing ages but  <br/>\nequal in the family. They can feed off each other and they can also help  each <br/>\nother when mommy and daddy are busy.  <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\nSecondary school education Graduate school education Home school education Graduate school education online High school education Chicago school education <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYAHOO!

Might I suggest a change in perspective? I start by knowing that <br/>\nmy children have a right to sleep and wake when they want. They do not <br/>\nNEED to be well-rested or healthy or whatever. Of course, I also assume <br/>\nthat I have a right to get whatever sleep I need, although this can be <br/>\ndifficult with very young children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with a child who stays up late and then gets up before getting very <br/>\nmuch sleep: Maybe the child needs some personal experience with <br/>\nfunctioning on not much sleep to come the conclusion that she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to do it on a regular basis. You could talk with her about how she <br/>\nfeels the next day when she sleeps a lot versus when she doesn&#39;t. It <br/>\nmay take several months or years (or maybe only days) before she comes <br/>\nto the conclusion that she&#39;d rather get more sleep. OR, she may not <br/>\never come to that conclusion. There may be things more important to her <br/>\nthan sleep, just as there are to some adults. I remember experimenting <br/>\nwith sleep and sleep schedules as a teenager. Don&#39;t forget to talk <br/>\nabout the effect a grumpy person may have on others in the family. <br/>\nHowever, sleep-deprived people are not necessarily grumpy towards <br/>\nothers, they could just be in a fog instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a young child wanting to stay up late: Would the older children <br/>\nbe willing to &quot;babysit&quot; for the four-year-olds after you go to sleep? <br/>\nWould the four-year-olds be willing to do something quiet near you or <br/>\nin a specified &quot;safe&quot; room after you go to sleep (watch videos with <br/>\nvery low sound or headphones, play with quiet toys,...?), so you can <br/>\nfeel they are safe? Can Mom rearrange her sleep schedule to match the <br/>\nchildren&#39;s more? Talk about this at a time when everyone&#39;s relaxed and <br/>\nit&#39;s not evening. Maybe someone in the family will have other ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all these cases, you could ask your children WHY they want to stay <br/>\nup so late. Maybe they want more time without an adult around? You <br/>\ncould stay out of their way more during the day. Maybe the best t.v. <br/>\nshows are on then? You could record them to watch later. Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should also tell the children that you would feel much better with <br/>\nmore sleep. Maybe they can brainstorm ideas for you to get the sleep <br/>\nyou want. Try some of their ideas, even if they seem a little strange. <br/>\nI found that my ideas about sleep were maybe brainwashed into me as a <br/>\nchild, and that actually I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; certain things sleep-wise that <br/>\nI thought I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck...<br/>\n<br/>\nRachael</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: How do we find a balance?","postDate":"1127225925","msgId":108414,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRncDVvNStqZmxiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTIwMTIwNDExLjUzNzgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjM1MjA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":108413,"nextInTopic":108415,"prevInTime":108413,"nextInTime":108415,"topicId":108381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve had a little of that discussion here too.

This is<br/>\nproblematic for us because I have numerous activities to drive kids to<br/>\nin the afternoons which means that we can&#39;t do the fun things they<br/>\nlike to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after a pow wow, we worked out that on the weekends when daddy<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to get up to work, we&#39;d have the younger ones go to bed<br/>\nwhen we do (usually sometime between 10:30 and midnight) and on<br/>\nweekends, they are free to go to bed when they want to.

I have one dh (13yo) that does well monitoring<br/>\nherself.  She sometimes will stay up all night working on her art, reading,<br/>\nwatching t.v, etc.   But when she realizes she is tired during the day she<br/>\nwill take a week or two and go to bed early and get up at a reasonable time<br/>\n(before noon!)   On the other hand I have a dh (10yo) who stays up late<br/>\nmostly watching t.v. or a times learning to sew and the next day she is as<br/>\nill as she can be.  We all suffer because of her attitude.  This has gone on<br/>\nfor about 4 or 5 months now.  My dh is pushing that we have a bedtime for<br/>\nher.  I have suggested that one of us go and lay down with her around 9 or<br/>\n10 and spend some time talking or reading with her in hopes she will settle<br/>\nin for the night.

I ve been reading on this board for a few weeks and I have a problem that I could use some help with.

I&#39;ve been reading on this board for a few weeks and I have a problem that I could use some help with.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I should start off by saying that I&#39;m a mother-of-five, ages 13, 9, 4, 2 and 7months.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling my oldest since 2000 (except for four months in 2003 when we moved to a new town and the kids decided to try the schools here) and my 9yo just recently came back home after two years in PS (his choice).  Initially I did the very structured school at home thing, followed The Well Trained Mind etc., but I gradually loosened up.  I&#39;ve been &quot;almost&quot; unschooling for about 18 months.  I say almost because my husband does not want me to homeschool and definitely doesn&#39;t want me to unschool, so I&#39;ve just been gradually dropping things from our &quot;curriculum&quot; and I have told the boys straight out that the only reason we do any structured stuff is because it is reassuring to their father and I figure that an hour or less per day is a very small sacrifice for all of us.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut anyway, let me get to the point.  In addition to moving towards unschooling, I&#39;ve managed to persuade my husband that we should get rid of the restrictions on the kids bedtimes and let the boys choose when to go to bed as long as they can be respectful of the rest of us who are asleep.  Well, this has worked pretty well, because although we&#39;re less than thrilled that the boys are staying up until 530 in the morning, we (or actually I) believe that they will eventually get over the novelty of the situation and start getting more rest.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe problem is that now my four-year-old and two-year-old daughters want to stay up with their big brothers until all hours of the night.  Until just a few days ago the girls, who slept in their beds in our bedroom, would just go to bed when my husband, the baby and I went to bed.  It was never a battle, they never cried, a lot of times my 2yo would ask to be put in her crib early.  Well, now that the girls are sleeping in their own room, they want to stay up late too.  My 4yo has even asked my husband why we&#39;re mean to her and her little sister for making them go to bed while the boys get to stay up.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t feel comfortable letting the girls stay up without any supervision, so I&#39;ve been staying up until 130 or 200 when the girls finally fall asleep and then I go to bed.  This wouldn&#39;t be a problem if I could sleep late, but my only chance to exercise is early in the morning when a friend and I go walking at 545 before our husbands get up and get ready for work. Even if I didn&#39;t walk, my baby wakes up at around 700 every morning and he no longer wants to just be nursed back to sleep.  I&#39;m just exhausted and my husband is getting more and more grouchy, bitching that he doesn&#39;t see the purpose in the boys staying up late and watching Nick at Night or playing GameCube until all hours of the night.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do.  I don&#39;t want to go back to telling the boys what time to go to bed because I feel that they should be allowed to decide something like that for themselves and I don&#39;t want to force the girls to go to bed because I feel that is sending them the message that they are somehow inferior to the boys either because of age or gender.   Also, I feel that since I finally won this particular battle, if I can just manage to prove to my husband that, yes, this was a good idea, I can get him to relax about the other rules he wants us to have in place in the house ie, chores, allowances, food choices and video games.  <br/>\n <br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for me?  Thanks so much.<br/>\n <br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo! for Good<br/>\n Click here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108420,"nextTopicId":108434}}
