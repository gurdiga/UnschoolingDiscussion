We have never lived in a neighborhood with <br/>\nother kids nearby. We do playdates with friends from church, homeschool <br/>\ngroups, etc. I think he&#39;d love to have more time with friends, but it&#39;s often <br/>\nvirtually impossible to arrange. He has a few very close friends, and has <br/>\nnever been a social animal. Mostly he&#39;s very happy with adults or by himself, <br/>\nbut he REALLY wishes his best friend lived with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25050,"nextTopicId":25053}}
