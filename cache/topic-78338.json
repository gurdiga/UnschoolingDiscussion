I have been no mail for several months since I moved to Austin, <br/>\nTX.  I recently switched to Daily Digest to ease back into my groups <br/>\nand I found many of your posts too interesting too miss out on!  So <br/>\nI&#39;m back.  I probably wasn&#39;t too involved before because I&#39;m a bit of <br/>\na group junkie and often found myself overwhelmed with emails.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway......my name is Angela and I have 2 girls (4.25 yrs & 22 <br/>\nmonths) and I&#39;m expecting #3 in early March.  I am enjoying <br/>\nunschooling my girls even at this young age.  I finally started to <br/>\nget it when my oldest dd didn&#39;t show any interest in learning her <br/>\nnumbers until she wanted to know what time it was!  She also taught <br/>\nherself to swim this summer (creating her own unique stroke, of <br/>\ncourse).  I love observing their little minds at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to be back- <br/>\nAngela McGinn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78512,"nextTopicId":78488}}
