Imagine if his <br/>\npriorities were different and he&#39;d often say no because he didn&#39;t like <br/>\nthe choices you made.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -requests for candy are mostly met with a no if we&#39;re out - we provide <br/>\n&gt; them with allowance each week, and they are entitled to purchase <br/>\n&gt; whatever they want with it - candy included.  However, I know they <br/>\n&gt; often ask if what they&#39;re buying &quot;is okay&quot; - I often say yes.  Once I <br/>\n&gt; have truly graduated to the other side, they won&#39;t ask anymore.  That <br/>\n&gt; would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What&#39;s your favorite food? What if the only way you could get out into <br/>\nthe world and out to where your favorite food (or book or movie) was <br/>\nwas to go with him? And what if you were out with him and the thing you <br/>\nreally wanted was right there within reach and he said no?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we as adults had to live our lives as kids, being dependent on <br/>\nsomeone, asking permission for each thing we wanted, we&#39;d go nuts! <br/>\n(And, hey, it might happen! And it might be our kids that we&#39;re saying <br/>\n&quot;No, your needs and wants aren&#39;t what I want to do for you. You can <br/>\ntake what I think you need,&quot; who are taking care of us!) *Life* and <br/>\nsociety so severely restrict kids&#39; freedom to get what they want for <br/>\nthemselves. We can add to that and be additional controllers in their <br/>\nlives. Or we can be their partners and recognize that they don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe freedoms that we do and compassionately help them get what they <br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe less needy they are, the less they&#39;ll need. If they know that 75% <br/>\nof their requests will be turned down, they have to ask for a lot more <br/>\nto get a better chance of getting the things they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -pop is definitely limited to parties/babysitters in our house, and <br/>\n&gt; the times my dh has one.  He likes it, so there is often pop stored in <br/>\n&gt; the cold cellar for those occasions.  Any requests by the kids to have <br/>\n&gt; pop in between is met with a no.  All the time.  Pop is a big trigger <br/>\n&gt; for me.  I can&#39;t seem to get over that coins disintegrate in it, the <br/>\n&gt; total lack of nutrition in it, and the large amount of <br/>\n&gt; calories/artificial sweeteners.

I didn&#39;t imagine <br/>\nit could do much harm and  I just knew it my heart that the people I met that <br/>\nweekend were on to  something good!<br/>\n <br/>\nI just let go of my arbitrary rules and kept reading and  breathing and <br/>\nreading some more.  The kids were just fine.  They  stayed up late a lot and <br/>\nwatched TV and ate lots of stuff that I wasn&#39;t  altogether comfortable with.  I <br/>\noccasionally bit my tongue  as they ate cookies for breakfast or cheese and <br/>\ncrackers all day long. I  let them make their own decisions about what and when they <br/>\nate but I also made  sure we had a good balance of all types of food in the <br/>\nhouse.   <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was the best transition for us because our home was very rule  oriented.  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t even know the terminology of rule vs  principle living but  letting <br/>\ngo of all our rules at once allowed  me to step back and examine each of them <br/>\nand be able to understand and  discover living by principles. <br/>\n <br/>\nOur family now is one where each person has the right to make their own  <br/>\nchoices about what they do, what they eat and when they sleep.  While some  of <br/>\nthese food choices are similar,(we all love Blue Bell Cookie dough ice  cream and <br/>\nhave been known to eat it in mass quantities) we each are very  unique in our <br/>\neating habits.<br/>\nI&#39;m very sensitive to sugar and feel best if I eat protein with several  <br/>\nsmall meals a day, my daughter is a vegetarian and loves donuts for  breakfast,  <br/>\nmy husband  sometimes eats pudding with protein  powder for breakfast, and my <br/>\nson goes through stages where he eats the  same thing for days.  This week it <br/>\nhas been pepperoni, mustard and pickle  sandwiches.  All in all, I think we all <br/>\neat a healthy balance of  nutritious food during any given week. <br/>\n <br/>\nI try and plan meals that has something each person will like although I  <br/>\nvery seldom cook any kind of red meat.  My husband orders steaks on his  frequent <br/>\nbusiness trips so he doesn&#39;t mind that we eat mostly vegetarian or fish  at <br/>\nhome. We all eat several small meals a day often at different times but  <br/>\nusually have some type of an evening meal together a few times a week.  I  often put <br/>\nout plates of fruits, vegies, cheese and crackers.  Sometimes  Logan and I <br/>\nwill steam an huge bunch of asparagus and eat it for a snack.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids were older (10 and 13) when we  started unschooling.   However, <br/>\nlearning to make choices that were best for their bodies seemed to be  easy for <br/>\nthem.  Food is just not an issue at our house any more.  Just  as the kids sleep <br/>\nwhen they are tired, they eat when they are hungry.   Sometimes, they eat <br/>\ncandy.

However, I know they often ask if what<br/>\nthey&#39;re buying &quot;is okay&quot; - I often say yes.  Once I have truly graduated to<br/>\nthe other side, they won&#39;t ask anymore.  That would be great.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRequests for candy don&#39;t happen every day here or even every week, but I do<br/>\ntry to get them the candy if they really want it and it isn&#39;t going to break<br/>\nthe budget, which it usually isn&#39;t.  My older dd&#39;s Halloween candy is still<br/>\nin the pantry and she could have eaten all of it if she had wanted to on<br/>\nHalloween night.  I realize that some kids have a sweeter tooth than my<br/>\nolder dd because my younger one does, but she still doesn&#39;t eat all her<br/>\ncandy at once. She makes it last.

Pop is a big trigger for me.  I can&#39;t seem<br/>\nto get over that coins disintegrate in it, the total lack of nutrition in<br/>\nit, and the large amount of calories/artificial sweeteners.  It will<br/>\nprobably be the last thing I&#39;ll let go of.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nStomach acid would probably melt coins too.  :-)  My dh keeps soda in the<br/>\nhouse.  I only like soda when we order pizza out.  It just doesn&#39;t quench my<br/>\nthirst.  My kids don&#39;t really like the bubbles very much but now at 8 and<br/>\n10, they&#39;ll drink a little.  It&#39;s never been off limits and maybe that is<br/>\nwhy it isn&#39;t a big deal to them?  Or maybe they just don&#39;t really like it.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know.  I do make cool aid in the summer and we make home-made<br/>\nlemonade with lemon juice from a bottle.  I tend to make it with less sugar<br/>\nthan any store bought sweetened beverage and the kids are generally happy<br/>\nwith it.  Once in a while they&#39;ll add more sugar to their cup if it isn&#39;t&#39;<br/>\nsweet enough.  My kids also drink a lot of water and really like water, esp.<br/>\nin hot weather.  Sometimes one will choose lemonade and the other will<br/>\nchoose milk or water.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Stories/comments on how you transitioned, if you ever had to, from some<br/>\ncontrol over food choices to no controls over food choices would be great.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were smaller, I definitely didn&#39;t bring lots of candy and<br/>\nsweets into the house.  What they didn&#39;t know about, they didn&#39;t miss.  I<br/>\nbake though and we almost always have something sweet in the house that I<br/>\nmade.  It wasn&#39;t until I had kids that I tried to make our sweets more on<br/>\nthe healthy side.  I use whole wheat flour in my cookies and bars, I make<br/>\nhomemade granola bars with oatmeal and grapenuts in them, pumpkin squares<br/>\nwith pumpkin in them.  Sutff like that. My kids like the goodies I make so<br/>\nthey don&#39;t feel deprived of sweets.  I try to keep fresh fruit in the house<br/>\nbut it&#39;s expensive and so we don&#39;t have as much as I&#39;d like.  I wish it<br/>\nlasted longer.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to make sure the kids had something healthy before eating sweets, but<br/>\nI gradually started saying yes to any request and I realized by watching<br/>\nthem that in the end it all worked out anyway.  I could have made my dd eat<br/>\nan apple before the poptart this morning, but she ate it after anyway.<br/>\nWhat difference does it make?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are just as excited about getting a box of strawberries as they are<br/>\na bag of Cadbury mini eggs.  They know not all foods are the same<br/>\nnutritionally.  We talk about stuff like that, just like we talk about<br/>\neverything else in life.  It just doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal what order<br/>\nthey eat their food in because I know from experience that it&#39;ll all even<br/>\nout over the course of a few days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing my kids do that seems peculiar to some people is eat one food at a<br/>\ntime, very often.  My younger dd, the one who likes sweets more than the<br/>\nother, will often eat a big bowl of frozen cooked peas for lunch.  That is<br/>\nwhat she requests.  Some nights for supper, she&#39;ll request potato and that&#39;s<br/>\nit.  Last night she had pulled pork.  Nothing else when we sat down to eat<br/>\ntogether.  Before bed she had French bread.  If you add the bread to the<br/>\nmeat, it would be like having eaten a pulled pork sandwich for supper.  She<br/>\njust didn&#39;t eat them together.  She also had ice cream yesterday, and<br/>\ngrapes, and carrots, and an apple, and a poptart.  I can&#39;t remember what<br/>\nelse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Game-enthusiast@...\">Game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] parent&#39;s issues food choices (LONG)","postDate":"1111761754","msgId":104876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzZjJhYTY4MTNkODcwNmI2NWFlZjk4OWMyMmRjNWE2QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDcwMWM1MzE0NCQwNGQwMTRkMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBTRUFSU0M+","referencesHeader":"PDAwNDcwMWM1MzE0NCQwNGQwMTRkMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBTRUFSU0M+"},"prevInTopic":104875,"nextInTopic":104878,"prevInTime":104875,"nextInTime":104877,"topicId":104875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Mar 25, 2005, at 9:07 AM, Sears Family wrote: -=-Pop is a big trigger for me.

I have confidence in my head that the idea of open food choices is sound - (I had a really hard time letting go of controls around video games about a year ago - now it&#39;s truly open season with the video games, and I&#39;m very comfortable with it.  This brings me confidence in ALL open choices, moreso than if I hadn&#39;t lived through the really uncomfortable part to get to a more balanced sense of life with video games.) I seem to react emotionally whenever I&#39;ve even remotely tried open food choices.  Which hasn&#39;t been for very long because I get so triggered that I think I&#39;m easier to be around when I have some control over food.  I know on this list that sounds terrible - but I&#39;m truly trying to figure out what is blocking me, because I&#39;d like to get to the other side.  But, just letting go and jumping right in has not really helped.  I have been saying yes more often - for sure.  And, when babysitters come and I&#39;m not around, they do have open season on all sorts of treats, along with healthy treats.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for my own clarity, some rules I have in my home:<br/>\n(again - for my clarity, and perhaps to discuss how &quot;controlling&quot; I am, to flash it out for all to see, and perhaps others who are not completely allowing open choices but would like to can identify- all in hopes of breaking through whatever this barrier I have is):<br/>\n-no sweet treats before a meal, particularly breakfast.  &quot;healthier food first - ie, oatmeal, toast, eggs, fruit, &quot;<br/>\n-often limit amount of dessert/sweet treats eaten (ie -  one bowl of ice cream)- sometimes because I&#39;m triggered, sometimes because I&#39;d like to make the box of ice cream last longer, since the budget is not allowing lots of leeway <br/>\n-If one food is requested over and over in one day - will often suggest another food, and point out that they&#39;ve already had 4 bowls of oatmeal - perhaps their body might like something else?
