The difference <br/>\nfrom then to now is so immense, that I now understand why unschoolers <br/>\nwant to make it clear, just what unschooling is.  Everytime you &quot;slip <br/>\nback&quot; and require learning from you children, you destroy the trust <br/>\nthat was building up in them.  The trust that you believe in them.  <br/>\nThe trust that they are smart enough to figure it out on their own.  <br/>\nThe trust that you belive that their interests and ideas are whats <br/>\nright for them.  When I relized that simple truth, I decided never <br/>\nto &quot;slip&quot; again, no matter how fearful I became.  I haven&#39;t.  I now <br/>\nsee the tremendous difference it has made in all our lives.  What the <br/>\ntrust really does for my children.  It&#39;s a lot of work, this letting <br/>\ngo of old mentalities.  I&#39;m still working.  <br/>\nI&#39;m writing this to try to help explain the difference in attitude, <br/>\nand why so many say, &quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot;.  I hope I made a <br/>\nlittle sense. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna, I&#39;m so glad you wrote this.  I&#39;ve been around dozens of other <br/>\npeople&#39;s AH HA moments and they are So valuable to their families and to <br/>\nthose reading their experiences that I can&#39;t let go of the knowledge that <br/>\ncontinuing discussions like these changes people&#39;s lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years some of the others on this list and I have seen people change <br/>\ntheir minds about spanking, and about TV, and about using math worksheets, <br/>\nand other particular things which were causing unhappiness in their families <br/>\nor stress between them and their kids.  How did we know?  They told us.  They <br/>\ncame and said &quot;Things are stressful at our house and unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>\nworking as well as we&#39;d like it to...&quot; and they laid out their factors.  Or <br/>\nthey came to argue against a discussion and stayed to be converted.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if none of us stay to help newcomers or to help untangle situations in <br/>\nwhich one parent is about to say, &quot;ENOUGH, School!&quot; unless things change <br/>\nprofoundly and quickly, then there isn&#39;t a centrally-located easily found <br/>\nresource for unschooling information.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if the information here is diluted or polluted by non-unschooling advice <br/>\nin sufficient measure, then people will still not see unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, Joyce was able to make a great, clear analogy:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If people want to be *pure unschoolers* -- not just be more relaxed<br/>\nhomeschoolers -- then they need to see real unadulterated unschooling in<br/>\naction. It&#39;s *scary* to get away from the well traveled shore. We&#39;re trying<br/>\nto show how people do navigate successfully without relying on the shoreline<br/>\nat all. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24976,"nextTopicId":25017}}
