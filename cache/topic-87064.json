Then it came up<br/>\nthat she couldn&#39;t wait for  Christmas vacation to be over so the kids could<br/>\nget back to learning.  Their minds were going to mush from just playing<br/>\nvideo games all day.  (Of course, I&#39;m thinking who made the rules of<br/>\nChristmas vacation for homeschoolers?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if she thought her kids would be willing to help me figure out how<br/>\nto play &quot;Romance VII&quot;, a game set during the Samurai period but that was<br/>\nrather complicated.  I told her it involved role playing, decision making, a<br/>\nstudy of history, strategy, etc..  My kids are gone for a week and I thought<br/>\nit would be nice to be able to show them how to play when they got back.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend looked at me like I grew 2 heads.  She said she was sure they<br/>\nwould love it but the point was she didn&#39;t want them playing any more vidoe<br/>\ngames.<br/>\n<br/>\nI continue to be baffled at why parents think it is necessary to suck all<br/>\nthe joy out of their kids&#39; days. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 30, 2003 1:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Preparing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/30/03 11:32:02 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mina@...\">mina@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; And I, and everyone else who writes FanFiction, does this with TV shows<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; movies.

I<br/>\nhave only seen him walk away a couple of times and returns to it at<br/>\nonce.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay now we know he really doesn&#39;t watch tv &quot;all day long.&quot; There are park<br/>\ndays and sports camp days and up until recently he was swimming every day<br/>\ntoo, (inside information!) wasn&#39;t he? No tv there. So tv all day long means<br/>\nmore than you are comfortable with. And that&#39;s okay, it just means it&#39;s a<br/>\nproblem for you and not him. Plus you have said that there are times when<br/>\nyou just can&#39;t take it anymore and turn it off and make him do other things.<br/>\nSo that is a limit on him and he&#39;s probably not comfortable with turning it<br/>\noff himself because he never knows when you might come and do that. Best to<br/>\nget in all the tv time he can before that happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you think tv is waste of time or not at all the uselful tool some<br/>\nthink it to be. Again fine for you. But Nicolas is obviously getting<br/>\nsomething from it that isn&#39;t coming from other things he could be doing. Sit<br/>\nwith him and find out what those things are. Maybe from watching and talking<br/>\nto him about the shows, no matter how stupid you think they are, you can<br/>\nfind that he does have other interests besides just sitting. He&#39;s not just<br/>\nsitting, there are things going on his mind that would probably astound<br/>\nyou!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso keep track of the times he isn&#39;t watching tv and let those times<br/>\nconvince you he isn&#39;t watching all day long. Instead of focusing on how much<br/>\nhe watches, start with how much he doesn&#39;t. I bet as time goes on, if you<br/>\ncan let go of the limits,  those non watching times will decrease. If you<br/>\ncan&#39;t let go of the limits, just be aware that his tv time will be more<br/>\nimportant to him than ever because he won&#39;t know when it ends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Preparing","postDate":"1072805846","msgId":87105,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3ZS4yNGMzMGRhNS4yZDIzMTFkNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":87099,"nextInTopic":87106,"prevInTime":87104,"nextInTime":87106,"topicId":87064,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/30/03 9:07:45 AM, jrossedd@aol.com writes:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1875070780\">In a message dated 12/30/03 9:07:45 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; In other words, you may not see what you&#39;re hoping for while you&#39;re so <br/>\nfixated on it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you might be looking for a moth and ignoring all those butterflies coming <br/>\nout and flying around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to find a link to an article just to find it&#39;s not online.  Huh.  <br/>\nBummer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nappeared in Nov/Dec 2001 HEM<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll See It When You Believe It<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing years of sporadic claims by people who claimed they had tried <br/>\nunschooling but it hadn&#39;t worked for them, I started tracking their similarities <br/>\nand, as usual, I learned something new.  And, as usual, I thought I should share <br/>\nit so others might not have to wonder for ten years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is a snapshot of what I thought I knew when I sat down to write this <br/>\none day not too long ago:  Some people don&#39;t know what unschooling is supposed <br/>\nto look like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I went to the flea market to buy a torque wrench but I didn&#39;t know what <br/>\none looked like, I would have a pretty hard time just finding one by looking <br/>\naround.  It probably wouldn&#39;t be on a table with clocks made of cross-cut cedar.  <br/>\nLooking through a tray of cassette tapes wouldn&#39;t help.  It would be <br/>\nespecially difficult if I didn&#39;t even know what a torque wrench was for.  I might look <br/>\nall through those wirey-boards and steel boxes computer-repair guy brought.  <br/>\nI could look for hours through cloth and paperback books and come home saying <br/>\n&quot;Going to the flea market for a torque wrench doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to go to the flea market regularly, pre-motherhood, to buy medieval- <br/>\nand Rennaisance-suggesting things to re-sell in the SCA.  It was fun.  I used <br/>\nto make enough to pay our way to tournaments by setting up my little homemade <br/>\ntent and some tables covered with pewter and silver-plated bowls and plates, <br/>\ncast aluminum tankards or goblets, hand-blown glasses from Mexico, fur collars, <br/>\nlittle wooden jewelry chests, old-looking jewelry, leather bags, brocade <br/>\ncurtains (without fiberglass or rubber), interesting little knives, wooden trays <br/>\nand bowls, and so forth.  I&#39;d sell them cheap, too.  I learned a lot doing that, <br/>\nand had fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Albuquerque flea market is huge.  I would stand, walk, and pull my cart <br/>\nfor two or three hours, scanning for shiny metal dishes, wood, leather, certain <br/>\ndesigns.  But most of the stuff got only enough glance to determine it was <br/>\nNOT what I was looking for.  I ignored piles of baby clothes, electronics, <br/>\nplastics and hand tools.  Many a torque wrench lay unseen.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers come away from a small school and into the big wide world.  Some <br/>\nsay &quot;Here is the wide world, and we will be in it and learn from everything <br/>\naround us.&quot;  Then they proceed to scan specifically for math, history, science, <br/>\nreading and writing.  Because they went to school, math to them looks like <br/>\nflat paper with numbers on it.  History looks like books many words and a few <br/>\nmaps and illustrations, all arranged in chronological order.  Science is wide <br/>\nopen—it might be a microscope, or a bug cage or some rocks and a magnifying <br/>\nglass, until the kids are older, and then it will start looking like numbers on <br/>\nflat paper, or maybe a book on anatomy, or the feared and revered &quot;Periodic Chart <br/>\nof the Elements.&quot;  Reading and writing should look like reading and writing <br/>\nhave always looked—books without illustrations (eventually, and the sooner and <br/>\nthicker the better), and reports with straight margins and numbered pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey scan their children&#39;s lives every day for schoolish things.  They&#39;re <br/>\nlooking for spiral notebooks and they ignore sunsets.  Looking for a 50-minute <br/>\nsession of history to prove attention span, they miss a pioneer dress-up game <br/>\nand an attempt to build a catapult.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a final stop before giving up, some come and declare their failure to <br/>\nthose who told them about unschooling.  They tell us it didn&#39;t work for their <br/>\nfamily, and that after all, they are the experts in their children, and so they <br/>\nknow that their own family is not creative enough to unschool, and their <br/>\nchildren crave structure.  Sometimes it seems they think those who say &quot;Unschooling <br/>\nis So COOL!&quot; are deluded nuts who don&#39;t care much about their children.  Other <br/>\ntimes I think they see our children as brilliant and theirs as dullards.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have come to believe that they just ignored the million things looking <br/>\nfor the five or six.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey thought if they left the kid alone for a month he might spontaneously <br/>\ncreate a four-subject routine, with some music, art and sports put in for <br/>\nextracurricular balance.  They envisioned that their child might say, at the age of <br/>\nfourteen (give or take a few) years, &quot;I&#39;m ready to learn biology now,&quot; which <br/>\nwould be the beginning of nine months of study, with three dissections and some <br/>\ntadpole measuring, maybe some plant genetics.  By May they should declare <br/>\nwhether they were more interested in botany or life sciences (step one in &quot;do you <br/>\nwant to go to medical school?&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a science-minded kid loves to take the dog down by the river and look <br/>\nfor wild berries and snakes, some parents say, &quot;My kid just wants to play.  He&#39;s <br/>\nnot interested in learning.  He&#39;ll never learn science just playing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEach little experience, every idea, is helping your child build his internal <br/>\nmodel of the universe.  He will not have the government-recommended blueprint <br/>\nfor the internal model of the universe, which can look surprisingly like a <br/>\nschool, and a political science class, a small flat map of the huge spherical <br/>\nworld, a job with increasing vacations leading to retirement, and not a lot more.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled children can organize their knowledge in free and better ways.  <br/>\nThey never need to feel they are through learning, or past the point that they <br/>\ncan begin something new.  Each thing they discover can be useful eventually.  <br/>\nIf we help provide them with ever-changing opportunities to see, hear, smell, <br/>\ntaste, feel, move and discuss, what they know will exceed in breadth and depth <br/>\nwhat any school&#39;s curriculum would have covered.  It won&#39;t be the same set of <br/>\nmaterials—it will be clearer and larger but different.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How will they learn everything they need to know?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the best of the high school graduates know everything they need to know?  <br/>\nNo, and at some point, ideally, they start learning on their own.  Some fail <br/>\nto get to that point, though.  Unschooled kids have a head start.  They know <br/>\nhow to find what they need to know, and they have not been trained to ignore <br/>\nthings that won&#39;t be on the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents see how and what their children are actually learning instead of <br/>\njust scanning for the half dozen school-things, unschooling will make sense <br/>\nto the parents.  If you wait for school to congeal from a busy life, you&#39;ll <br/>\nkeep being disappointed.  If you learn to see everything instead of just school <br/>\nthings, unschooling will start working for you.  When you see it you will <br/>\nbelieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Preparing","postDate":"1072803822","msgId":87099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhNi4xZTk2NzE4OS4yZDIzMDllZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":87093,"nextInTopic":87105,"prevInTime":87098,"nextInTime":87100,"topicId":87064,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/30/03 6:28:39 AM, unschoolingdad@usa.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-423040565\">In a message dated 12/30/03 6:28:39 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdad@...\">unschoolingdad@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I would sit and watch his shows with him, talk to him about them, ask <br/>\nquestions why he likes this show over that one, etc.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a warning to offer about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t ask in a belittling and judgmental way if you can avoid it.

The issue is about him, not you<br/>\n(I always hate that part &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, does the fact that YOU have a problem with tv indicate to Nicolas that<br/>\nhe better hurry up and watch it before you get fed up and decide to take his<br/>\nfreedom away again?<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be very controlling about the tv, naps, bedtimes, you name it, I<br/>\ncontrolled it....all in the name of doing what was &quot;best&quot; for my kids.  When<br/>\nwe completely let go about 3 years ago, Adriane was 10.  She sat in a<br/>\nrecliner and watched tv for about 3 months.  I mean she rarely moved at all.<br/>\nShe got grumpy and mean which is very much against her nature so I pointed<br/>\nout that lots of people and animals get grumpy when they aren&#39;t getting much<br/>\nmovement, much fresh air, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nAdriane ignored that advice....can you imagine that &lt;grin&gt;?  She continued<br/>\nto sit and watch....then I noticed her flipping channels more.  So I would<br/>\ninvite her on outings with me and the younger kids.  Sometimes she would go<br/>\n(I would point out that she seemed happier being out of the house....I never<br/>\ndemonized tv, just talked about what was happening to her body).<br/>\nEventually, she made the connection about too much sedantary life and not<br/>\nfeeling well.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe now goes in spurts.  Somedays she is up in her room reading and doing<br/>\njigsaw puzzles all day, or maybe out playing with the little kids (they<br/>\nbuilt a launcher and send my son flying through the air), or she might watch<br/>\ntv all day.  But I notice that most of what she watches is dealing with<br/>\nrelationships, social interaction, morals, etc., stuff a 13yo is dealing<br/>\nwith in her head that she may or may not want to share with her mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn defense of &quot;fluff&quot; tv, Adriane used to watch all the Disney teenie-bopper<br/>\nshows over and over, Lizzie Mcguire, Smart Kid, Sister Sister.  I truly<br/>\nthought my head might explode, then something happened to make me realize<br/>\nthere is no such thing as &quot;fluff&quot; tv, books, music, anything.....that it ALL<br/>\ncounts as Sandra says.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was about 11, Adriane was watching a show and the joke was that a<br/>\nblack kid didn&#39;t know who Harriett Tubman was.  Adriane laughed like she got<br/>\nthe joke.  I asked her if she knew who Ms. Tubman was and she said yes.  She<br/>\nhad learned about the underground railroad watching Sister Sister.  Go<br/>\nfigure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry its so long....just wanted to say, relax, enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Annette&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:boujamama@...\">boujamama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 29, 2003 8:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] RE: Preparing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I guess we aren&#39;t really preparing or kids for &quot;jobs&quot; in the future, but<br/>\n&gt; more of a life, one to chose as they wish to live.

I was spending too much time on the internet at one point and it was hurting my kids and my family. I had to change my habits. Talk with him about his behaviour maybe?
