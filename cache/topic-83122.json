I mean, doesn&#39;t that prove that<br/>\npublic schools cause violent crime? Where are the cameras? Where is<br/>\nDan Rather? Where is the CBS Evening News team condemning public<br/>\nschools for the crime they foster by compelling kids to be in<br/>\nschool? Feel free to send a copy of this link, this story, to Dan<br/>\nRather on CBS Evening News.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, I wonder what would happen if everyone sent every story about <br/>\nevery crime, at least the ones that we hear about, that takes place <br/>\nin our public schools to Dan Rather.  Do you think he would see the <br/>\nlight and stop drawing terribly flawed conclusions in his news <br/>\nreporting? Remember that these are schools which all tax-payers are <br/>\nforced to support and which all children are forced by compulsory <br/>\nattendance laws to attend, except for those rich enough to send their <br/>\nkids to private or parochial schools, or those who have loving caring <br/>\nand sacrificing parents who elect to school them at home. Do you <br/>\nthink Dan Rather would comprehend that his logic and his reporting on <br/>\nthe homeschool stories last week were convoluted?  I wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it is Dan Rather who is still defending his bias in reporting the <br/>\ntwo episodes of CBS Evening News last week.  Maybe the shows sponsors <br/>\nwould like to read the stories about public school crime?  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83118,"nextTopicId":83123}}
