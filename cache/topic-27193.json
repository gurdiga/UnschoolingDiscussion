Everything in the Monitor is<br/>\ninternational and US news and features, except for one religious article<br/>\nthat has appeared each day in the Home Forum section since 1908, at the<br/>\nrequest of the paper&#39;s founder, Mary Baker Eddy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an age of corporate conglomerates dominating news media, the Monitor<br/>\ncombination of church ownership, a public-service mission, and commitment to<br/>\ncovering the world (not to mention the fact that it was founded by a woman<br/>\nshortly after the turn of the century, when US women didn&#39;t yet have the<br/>\nvote!) gives the paper a uniquely independent voice in journalism.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you compare to other newspapers covering international news?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike most US dailies, the Monitor does not rely on wire services, like AP<br/>\nand Reuters, for its international coverage. We have writers based in 11<br/>\ncountries, including Russia, China, France, the UK, Kenya, Mexico, the<br/>\nMiddle East, and India, as well as throughout the US.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does the Christian Science church publish a newspaper?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne answer might be found in a story the Monitor&#39;s Washington bureau chief,<br/>\nDavid Cook, told in a recent talk he gave:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Consider this case. It is 1907. An elderly New England woman finds herself<br/>\nbeing targeted by Joseph Pulitzer&#39;s New York World. She is 86 years old and<br/>\nholds some unconventional religious beliefs that she expounds in a book. The<br/>\nbook becomes a bestseller, making her wealthy and a well-known public<br/>\nfigure.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The New York World decides she is incapable of managing her own affairs and<br/>\npersuades some of her friends and her two sons to sue for control of her<br/>\nestate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Boston and New Hampshire newspapers and major wire services<br/>\ninterview this person and find her competent, the New York World is<br/>\nunrelenting.
