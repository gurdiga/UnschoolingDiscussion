I think she came<br/>\n  hoping to display her wonderful parenting skills and style to a group she<br/>\n  figured wouldn&#39;t just be fundamentalist Christians.   She wanted everyone<br/>\n  to know she was an open minded vegetarian atheist, but she didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n  be any more open minded than her personal comfort level.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There were some very telling things in her posts.   They told of a person<br/>\n  who hadn&#39;t really thought about parenting beyond what we all hear on the<br/>\n  TV commercials.   They told of someone who never even thought about<br/>\n  respecting kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n  She wrote about a fear of unschooling automatons, but it seems clear she<br/>\n  already thinks of children that way or she would have given more thought<br/>\n  to her comments about her own kid never eating anything but sweets if she<br/>\n  didn&#39;t intervene.   And later comments about her kids never finding their<br/>\n  own interests if she didn&#39;t force them into certain activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She clearly equated unschooling with neglect, which happens all the time,<br/>\n  but she didn&#39;t stick around long enough to find out she was wrong.  <br/>\n  That&#39;s why she left, too.  She was afraid of finding out she might be<br/>\n  wrong, and wrong about more than unschooling being neglect. <br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT... she was also miffed.   And while she twists these things around in<br/>\n  her mind maybe there&#39;ll be one little thing she heard here (from all the<br/>\n  good people who were dedicated enough to post)  that won&#39;t leave her<br/>\n  alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I find it fascinating that it&#39;s often the people who take pride in being<br/>\n  open minded and different who have such a hard time letting go of the<br/>\n  traditional teachy-schooly-discipline parenting thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n  ***And I get disappointed <br/>\n  when someone says they were going to answer a person and they say <br/>\n  nevermind because the person unsubbed. ***<br/>\n<br/>\n  HEY!  I did that!  It was mostly my pathetic attempt at humor which I can<br/>\n  see failed, miserably.  Again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I will say this about her ideas regarding protecting kids from<br/>\n  hardship and frustration.  They&#39;re silly. <br/>\n<br/>\n  A person can&#39;t live one year without dealing with hardship and<br/>\n  frustration, so how she got to adulthood believing we somehow need to<br/>\n  make sure our kids experience it, I can&#39;t understand.

And in spite of what many believe it isn&#39;t the<br/>\n  hardship or frustration that we learn so much from, it&#39;s the recovery<br/>\n  from those things.  We can give our kids safe shelter, time to recover<br/>\n  and heal and grow stronger.  The world is full of criminal and tragic<br/>\n  examples of people who&#39;ve endured hardships and could never recover, who<br/>\n  had no safe shelter, no way to heal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope lurking wannabe unschoolers here are smarter than to worry about<br/>\n  Christina&#39;s thoughtless remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Deb L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;What we call education and culture is for the most part nothing but the<br/>\n  substitution <br/>\n  of reading for experience, of literature for life, of the obsolete<br/>\n  fictitious for the contemporary real&quot;<br/>\n  ~George Bernard Shaw~<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
