They licensed them so that they could have hours of paper work, stupid rules that make their work less effective, and have to pay $15,000.00 Plus a Year in insurance.  I was seriously thinking of going into midwifery before but I couldn&#39;t deal with the crap that&#39;s dealt out.  I preferred the old days when they just did the best they could and the Dr.s stayed out of their way.  There are perks know though.  They can write prescriptions and admit patient to the hospital and the OB no longer has jurisdiction over the patient.  Some of them also get to have a reason to charge more.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Heathers","postDate":"1059861483","msgId":77905,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzkwMWMzNTk0ZCQ3ZDYxN2E0MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDZFMzM5RjU5LUM1MEEtMTFENy05REYxLTAwMzA2NUEzMDAyNEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPDAyMDMwMWMzNTkzNCQ1MWYwMjU1MCQ3NGVkNGYxOEB5b3VyemU4Y3h2cjh0dD4="},"prevInTopic":77904,"nextInTopic":77912,"prevInTime":77904,"nextInTime":77906,"topicId":77899,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
