Maybe the family is just <br/>\nliving their lives with their kids, just like they are going to when the <br/>\nchild reaches the magic age of compulsory education.

I can see a few families changing their <br/>\nminds during those years, but most don&#39;t.  If they are planning to <br/>\nunschool, most of them do.  Actually, it can be useful for some people to <br/>\nstart noticing all the learning that goes on during the &quot;preschool&quot; <br/>\nyears.  Then they&#39;re less like to start panicking when their kid doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhappen to learn something that his friends are learning at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could see making the distinction if people were going to be doing <br/>\nsomething very different with their kids once they were school age, but we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do anything different with Lars when he turned 5, and neither did my <br/>\ndaughter with my granddaughter.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything magic about <br/>\nschool age, at least to us types.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What exactly is PRE-Unschooling?","postDate":"1029192623","msgId":40831,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2LjJjMTZiODdhLjJhODk5NWFmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40829,"nextInTopic":40837,"prevInTime":40830,"nextInTime":40832,"topicId":40829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/12/02 4:34:33 PM, kevin.tucker@microchip.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-660810082\">In a message dated 8/12/02 4:34:33 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevin.tucker@...\">kevin.tucker@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; when is a child at a &quot;pre&quot; unschooling stage?
