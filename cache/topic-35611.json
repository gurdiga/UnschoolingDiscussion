So this one is the one that I remember really liking - I <br/>\ncarried it around and tried to talk about it with all my friends for a few <br/>\nweeks. They put up with me &lt;g&gt;. My kids each asked me, one after another, if <br/>\nI was reading that book because of them. Heck YEAH - they are ALL <br/>\nexplosive!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re all intense, creative, dramatic, high-energy kids. All have gone <br/>\nthrough stages of easy frustration and being quick to throw a fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t know what it was like to have easy-going, laid-back kids, although <br/>\nI must admit I&#39;ve imagined it MANY times &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to like the parenting books that put an emphasis on doing things that <br/>\nstrengthen the parent-child relationship. I do not like books that encourage <br/>\nbehaviorist sorts of manipulations and punishments or briberies (see my bias <br/>\nshowing?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other parenting book I REALLY REALLY like is: &quot;The Parent-Teen <br/>\nBreakthrough: The Relationship Approach&quot; by Mira Kirshenbaum. And I think <br/>\npeople should read it when the kids are pre-teens or younger - it applies <br/>\nequally to those years, even though the examples are for older teens. Look at <br/>\nthis review from a reader (off Amazon) and tell me the last couple of lines <br/>\ndon&#39;t reflect how we unschoolers often feel:<br/>\n****<br/>\nI found this book browsing in a store. I have been referring to it for over a <br/>\nyear now and it has changed my relationship with my 15 and 16 year old. There <br/>\nare no more fights over the little things in life, no more nagging. Just deep <br/>\nconcern for my children and the time we have together. When I tell my friends <br/>\nof the theories in this book they think I am avoiding dealing with teen age <br/>\nconflicts, but they will admit to arguing a lot in their homes. Sometimes I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s a gamble to practice this method, what if at the end of the teen <br/>\nyears it was not the way to parent? But the results now are so incredibly <br/>\nrewarding, it almost imossible to think it is not the best way to go.<br/>\n    ********<br/>\n<br/>\npamS<br/>\nThis post is intended to contribute to us understanding unschooling better or <br/>\nto building a sense of community.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109120623,"authorName":"Camille Bauer","from":"&quot;Camille Bauer&quot; &lt;goddessofwisdom2@...&gt;","profile":"granolamomi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The Explosive Child WAS: alphabet frustration","postDate":"1019504920","msgId":35638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBVjY0WTRwYmF1YkhlVm56Q1cwMDAwYjI1ZUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35622,"nextInTopic":35641,"prevInTime":35637,"nextInTime":35639,"topicId":35611,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I went and looked, it was a different book, not the Explosive Child.
