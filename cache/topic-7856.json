My attitude towards breastfeeding has changed<br/>\n and grown considerably over the last few years.  While I am more aware than<br/>\n ever why breastfeeding is so important I have become less judgemental. <br/>\n While I use to say to my daughter whenever we saw a bottle feeding baby,<br/>\n &quot;poor baby has to drink from a bottle and can&#39;t have mommy&#39;s milk,&quot; I am<br/>\n more aware of people having circumstances that I know nothing about.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarli,<br/>\nThanks for your post.  I think you&#39;ve hit upon the essence of the matter.  <br/>\nYes, human milk is best for human babies.  It can not be duplicated.  <br/>\nHowever, everyone&#39;s circumstances are different and for some people it is not <br/>\nthe best option.  And you&#39;re right - those circumstances are not something <br/>\nthat others can know anything about by observation.  They are deeply <br/>\npersonal.  For some women, like me, it may be impossible to breastfeed.  Not <br/>\nall geographical locations have milk banks upon which to draw.  Some women <br/>\nmay not be comfortable with using milk from a milk bank.  Some women may be <br/>\nphysically capable of producing milk but it may not be best for Mom or Baby <br/>\nto use that ability; e.g. Mom is taking necessary meds that would be harmful <br/>\nto baby, or Mom has a different problem that makes nursing unsafe for her.    <br/>\nThere could be other circumstances as well, as  Buzz pointed out in her <br/>\nthoughtful post.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the spirit of your post and I think it&#39;s great that you&#39;re <br/>\nbecoming a LLL leader.  (BTW, I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t point and say &quot;poor baby&quot; <br/>\nanymore.  If anyone pointed at my Josie and said that I would be deeply <br/>\noffended and also somewhat amused - she&#39;s definitely a happy, thriving girl <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t fit the &quot;poor baby&quot; bill! )  Your post has helped me feel less <br/>\nanimosity towards what I used to call the Lactation Police.  A shift in <br/>\nthinking is almost always a difficult, but productive thing.  I&#39;m glad to be <br/>\nable to broaden my viewpoint.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** KiM ***<br/>\nruns with scissors</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7824,"nextTopicId":7857}}
