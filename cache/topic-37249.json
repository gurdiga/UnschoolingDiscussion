This was <br/>\n  written in 1998, but it&#39;s easier for me to plug it in here than to write it <br/>\n  again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BORED NO MORE<br/>\n  by SandraDodd, 1998<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another homeschooling mom once wrote, “It&#39;s a valuable lesson to learn to <br/>\n  deal with boredom, just like all other emotions.” <br/>\n<br/>\n  Until I read that, I hadn’t ever thought of boredom as an emotion. I liked <br/>\n  the idea. When a child comes to me seeking advice on how to deal with any <br/>\n  emotional state, I&#39;m flattered and glad for the opportunity. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Traditionally in this culture boredom is seen as a state of sin. “I’m bored” <br/>\n  is met by unthinking parents with, “Then mop the kitchen,” or “You have a <br/>\n  thousand dollars’ worth of toys, you can’t be bored,” or “Boredom’s good <br/>\n  for you.” I believe the VERY common habit of belittling children who use the <br/>\n  word “bored” should be rethought (or “thought,” since it seems many parents <br/>\n  have never considered it carefully but just repeat what their parents said to <br/>\n  them). <br/>\n<br/>\n  If a child came and said she was heartbroken would you tell her she was a <br/>\n  brat and should clean the garage? If a child came and said he was angry <br/>\n  enough to hit would you say, “Then sit down and read a book whether you want <br/>\n  to or not”? Wouldn’t you try to help them? It&#39;s nonsensical to me that some <br/>\n  parents shame their children for saying they are at a loss about what to do <br/>\n  next. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The most to be accomplished from punishing or sending bored kids away is that <br/>\n  the kids will learn not to go to that parent for advice and ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes the real message behind &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is &quot;I&#39;m little and feeling <br/>\n  agitated and vaguely unhappy and I don&#39;t know what I can do to get over this <br/>\n  uncomfortable feeling. What would you do if you were my age, in this house, <br/>\n  on a day like this?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that deserves a helpful, respectful response. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It is rare that my children say, “I’m bored,” but when they do I walk with <br/>\n  them where they are, or to some other part of the house, thinking quickly <br/>\n  about what I might have that they have never seen, or haven’t seen for a <br/>\n  while. I think of art supplies or games or toys or musical instruments they <br/>\n  haven’t thought of for a long time. I scan my mind and the house for things <br/>\n  which would provide some visual, auditory, olfactory, or mental stimulation, <br/>\n  preferably two or three of those. Tactile stimulation is good too--perhaps <br/>\n  the offer of a shower or bath with new/different toys, or different soap or <br/>\n  something. Sometimes “watering the yard” (playing with the hose) will do. <br/>\n  When a baby cries for no clear reason, parents will often joyfully see <br/>\n  whether the baby means “I’m uncomfortable.” They’ll try a change of <br/>\n  clothes, physical contact, a change of temperature, more air, less air, hot <br/>\n  food, cold food, a stroll outside, a car ride, SOMETHING different. Older <br/>\n  kids have the same needs, and the expression of that need might come through <br/>\n  as whining, irritability, or a claim of boredom. <br/>\n  Maybe it’s not physical need, but intellectual need. Boredom is a desire for <br/>\n  input which unschooling parents should welcome. It’s a child saying “How can <br/>\n  I add excitement to my life?” This can be a big opportunity to introduce a <br/>\n  new subject, activity, or thought-collection. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe it’s an emotional need, and the parent’s undivided attention for a <br/>\n  little while will solve the problem. A walk, some joking, a hug, inquiries <br/>\n  about progress on the child’s projects or plans or friends might serve many <br/>\n  purposes at once. If after a walk and a talk the child is not quite <br/>\n  refreshed, you still had that time together, which made “I’m bored” a useful <br/>\n  invitation to bonding. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes “bored” means tired, low on energy, needing a break from conscious <br/>\n  thought and responsibility. Arranging a nap, or putting on a soothing video <br/>\n  (even for older kids--a romance instead of an action flick, or light drama <br/>\n  instead of comedy), leaving a pillow on the couch and herding the rest of the <br/>\n  family in other directions might result in an unplanned but needed nap. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I’m grown. I still get bored occasionally. Thinking about why I’m bored and <br/>\n  forgiving myself for being bored have helped me assist my children in <br/>\n  learning some coping skills they can use in their own lives. I have also used <br/>\n  my occasional boredom as a trigger to seek out the kids. If there’s a lull in <br/>\n  my life now I should fill it with those children who will be gone too soon. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Welcome opportunities to learn about when and why your child asks for your <br/>\n  advice and stimulation. The threshhold of needing the parent will change over <br/>\n  time, and parents can really use knowing where it is and seeing the benefit <br/>\n  in it. One complaint of parents of school kids is that communications are <br/>\n  lacking or are misunderstood. Homeschoolers have the fulltime luxury of the <br/>\n  chance to do better. Unschoolers have the added advantage of “counting” <br/>\n  every interaction as a learning experience. Self awareness, interpersonal <br/>\n  skills, creativity and compassion all come into play when a child and a <br/>\n  parent can build an uplifting memory from “I’m bored.” <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
