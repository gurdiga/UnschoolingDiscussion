I STILL have dreams about moving to Avila beach.<br/>\nWe positively love that area of Cali and had wanted to move to San Luis<br/>\nObispo. We decided it was WAY too expensive and moved to FL instead.<br/>\nSometimes I wish we&#39;d at least tried Cali first.<br/>\nWe looked at a house up on the hill in Avila beach that I&#39;ve never<br/>\nforgotten.<br/>\nIt was white and oldish style with a porch that wrapped all around. (a<br/>\nmere<br/>\n$300,000 ten years ago). I decided I wanted to stay a homeowner and we<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have been if we&#39;d moved there.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n$300,000 ten years ago?  It&#39;s got to be worth at least a million now!<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago Unocal was ordered to  clean up huge oil spills in Avila<br/>\nBeach.  They had to tear down all the shacks across from the beach (you<br/>\nknow, mom and pop type stuff - the ones we used to go into barefoot in<br/>\nthe summer and get snow cones because we were boiling in the sun).  The<br/>\nstores across the street have changed, most are gone now.  But the beach<br/>\nis nicer, no more tar to clean off when you get home.  And a huge<br/>\nplayground, and easier parking.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes it is expensive - the whole central coast is.  We got lucky, we were<br/>\nliving in Northern CA and my dad offered us this house - we couldn&#39;t<br/>\nafford to stay up in the north bay anymore, so we took him up on it.<br/>\nNow my husband is back in his old stomping grounds and surfing again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still miss the falling down shacks on the beach, just like I miss<br/>\nAspen soda (which hardly anyone has heard of).  But I&#39;m back home now<br/>\nand I love being able to raise my kids in the same area I grew up in,<br/>\njust a few miles from their papa (who, although he has at least 18 years<br/>\nof schooling - he&#39;s a doc - loves and fully supports our unschooling the<br/>\nkids).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough rambling for now - funny, I&#39;ve been on this list for over a year,<br/>\noff and on, but I&#39;ve never introduced myself.  Well, there&#39;s a bit of it<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho loves this list and feels like she knows everyone and will try to<br/>\npost more frequently.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57817,"nextTopicId":57886}}
