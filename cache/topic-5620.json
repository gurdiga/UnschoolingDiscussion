Then I would bone up on it for several months by reading<br/>\nbooks, writing essays, discussing it with subject matter experts, exchanging<br/>\ne-mails etc.  When I felt competent enough, I could go there and be a<br/>\nvolunteer tour guide for six months or so.  After that, I might choose<br/>\nanother perhaps unrelated site and start the process all over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a great way to become educated, meet people, and give something back to<br/>\nthe community all at the same time!  At least to me, this option blows the<br/>\nsocks off the more conventional way of &quot;getting educated&quot; (paying tuition,<br/>\nlistening to lectures, completing homework assignments, and taking tests).<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/joandersen\">http://members.xoom.com/joandersen</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5583,"nextTopicId":5622}}
