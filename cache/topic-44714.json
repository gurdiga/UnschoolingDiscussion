That alone sounds great to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other piece, which Marilyn seems to miss, is that very few people just<br/>\nstay home with their kids all their lives.  Unless you have so many children<br/>\nthat you are home from your late teens into your seventies with all of them,<br/>\nyou will have many child-free years to devote your energies to anything you<br/>\nchoose.  Of course, many people work part- or full-time while homeschooling,<br/>\nvolunteer their time, etc.  Plus, their kids, being unconstrained by the<br/>\nschool day schedule, often work and/or volunteer.  I had trouble seeing the<br/>\nproblem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Marilyn thinks homeschoolers are *home* schooling.  My friends make<br/>\nthe same mistake.  But I&#39;m not home very much!
