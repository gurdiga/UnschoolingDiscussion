She never<br/>\nhad enough time and always got a stomach ache.  Also, the noise level in the<br/>\ncafeteria was unbelievable. As for the bus, I drove her to school, but on<br/>\nthe days we went on field trips I was horrified by the bad driving that went<br/>\non, as well as the things that go on behind those seats (one little girl had<br/>\na rock thrown at her).
