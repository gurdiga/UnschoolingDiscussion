And <br/>\nits only in the past few years has my mom said any kind of comment about <br/>\nmy choices. I mean ANY. She was a &#39;hands-off&#39; mother and sometimes, as a <br/>\nteen or a young adult, I wish I had input that could of helped me. She <br/>\noffered none.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after reading posts from Tia and Dar, I realize its not that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have confidence in me, its because she doesn&#39;t have confidence in <br/>\nHERSELF! Confidence to know that she gave me the modeling and grounding <br/>\nthat was necessary for me to make informed and intelligent choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts her issue, not yours. Do yourself a favour and keep reminding <br/>\nyourself. Its not easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nParents are the ones that should tread the lightest, because their words <br/>\ncut the hardest.<br/>\n<br/>\nwarm regards,<br/>\nkolleen<br/>\n<br/>\nps. I&#39;m sure your doing great with your children, from your posts you <br/>\nsure sound like it!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30255,"nextTopicId":30262}}
