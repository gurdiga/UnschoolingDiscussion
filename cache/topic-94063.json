How have others dealt with <br/>\nthis? Heather is 12.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t give you good advice, I haven&#39;t figured this out myself yet. I just feel the fear and try to breathe through it, telling myself &quot;they are capable, they can handle this&quot; a lot.<br/>\nMy boys really like to walk up to the mall. It&#39;s not far, but we&#39;re right in town so there&#39;s a major intersection to cross. I suppose I&#39;ve seen too much in my life, kids hit, adults hit...my imagination gets carried away. I don&#39;t like it, but I try not to show my fear. They&#39;re really responsible, always calling if they aren&#39;t home at the time they previously planned. This week they walked up with another unschooling friend and I was supposed to pick them up since it would be dark. They tried to get through but after the line was busy they decided to walk. It&#39;s totally dark and there&#39;s a stretch that doesn&#39;t have street lights..yikes. I was a nervous wreck until they showed up.:)<br/>\nTrevor&#39;s 14, I hope this gets better.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;There is no way to <br/>\npeace.
