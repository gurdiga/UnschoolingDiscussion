You could make up a list of things to find on your hike (certain trees, ferns, wildlife, etc. native to your community) and then go for it.  I&#39;ve done this with my dd (almost 3) and she&#39;s had a great time.  Obviously, your kids are older, so you can look for more advanced things than rocks, flowers and sticks :o)  Try orienteering, using a compass and map.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not take the kids fishing?  Does he go out on a boat, canoe or fly fish?  This would be a great way to expose the kids to something he enjoys, and they might become interested in it too.  Why not rent a canoe(s) (if you don&#39;t have one) and take a trip on a local lake (if that&#39;s feasible).  Paddling is wonderfully relaxing, and a great way to take in the local flora and fawna.  You could make a day of it, with a picnic on the shore.  You could take some lovely pictures, journal, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about a trip to a local organic farm?  If dh knows a bit about gardening (but perhaps doesn&#39;t like the work) learning about agriculture in your community might be of interest to him.  Or even a nursery, where flowers, shrubs, etc. are grown from seed.  It might be a neat trip for everyone to learn the best types of plantlife to grow in your area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I could think of more,  but my dd wants milk ...  better go.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nx Amanda x<br/>\n(new member / dd Timber : almost three years old)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]OK GIRLS AND GUYS I DID IT.","postDate":"1112793115","msgId":105185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1LjQyYjY1ODdkLjJmODUzYTFiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":105184,"nextInTopic":105186,"prevInTime":105184,"nextInTime":105186,"topicId":105166,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/6/2005 7:58:21 AM Central Standard Time, debra.rossing@mastercam.com writes: finding  your way from pt a to pt b with a map and compass","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-87877047\">In a message dated 4/6/2005 7:58:21 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nfinding  your way from pt a to <br/>\npt b with a map and compass (drat what is that  called?)? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\nOrienteering?<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":200184763,"authorName":"Heidi Here","from":"&quot;Heidi Here&quot; &lt;kleincrew@...&gt;","profile":"kleincrew","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]OK GIRLS AND GUYS I DID IT.","postDate":"1112792777","msgId":105188,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWM1M2FhOSQ2Yjc4N2U3MCQwYjAwMDAwYUBNb20+","referencesHeader":"PGQzMG00OSszdHJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105187,"nextInTopic":105189,"prevInTime":105187,"nextInTime":105189,"topicId":105166,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"finding your way from pt a to pt b with a map and compass (drat what is that called?)?

If it&#39;s something <br/>\nthey would be interested in pursuing, there&#39;s a whole science <br/>\ncurriculum just begging to be explored!  They could learn about <br/>\necosystems, biology, the art of tying flies; there&#39;s tons of physics <br/>\ninvolved in fly fishing, and for a literature tie-in, they could read <br/>\nor watch the movie version of &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; -- there are so <br/>\nmany possibilities.  And, how cool for them to relate to your dh in an <br/>\nenvironment he loves and (I&#39;m assuming) would be enthusiastic about <br/>\nsharing with them!  Even if they didn&#39;t want to participate in the <br/>\nactual hunting, they could go with him to just spot animals, to look <br/>\nfor likely spots, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nJackie Chovanes<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jchovanes@...\">jchovanes@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170900535,"authorName":"nancy sebastian","from":"nancy sebastian &lt;squirlygirl1970@...&gt;","profile":"squirlygirl1970","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]OK GIRLS AND GUYS I DID IT.","postDate":"1112765428","msgId":105181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDA2MDUzMDI4LjU2NDE2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"NjY2Nw=="},"prevInTopic":105168,"nextInTopic":105184,"prevInTime":105180,"nextInTime":105182,"topicId":105166,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Thanks for the comments.The only DH likes is war games on the computer.

We are getting ready to make a garden but<br/>\nhe will end up leaving that for me to do. He likes<br/>\nfishing and hunting. I really don&#39;t know much about<br/>\neither. That is pretty much what he likes to do. Have<br/>\nany suggestions. It really don&#39;t matter just as long<br/>\nas I can get him involved.

What are DH&#39;s interests as <br/>\nwell? A good way to sustain things is if there are things he is <br/>\ninterested in that he is passing along/sharing with the kids. So, if <br/>\nhe loves dominoes, get a nice double 12 set if you don&#39;t already <br/>\nhave one and play Mexican train or hand and foot or whatever. If <br/>\nhe&#39;s a card player, cribbage and canasta are all about number <br/>\npatterns. Gardening? Old movies? Photography? Wood carving? <br/>\n<br/>\nGamewise there are tons of cool games out - best picks are things <br/>\nthat have lots of open ended discussion possibilities - trivial <br/>\npursuit (there&#39;s a cool version for the playstation - there are 3 <br/>\nvariations and one goes very quickly if the length of the game is an <br/>\nissue with the kids); Apples to Apples; and there&#39;s a Dr Seuss game <br/>\nthat is all about making rhymes - you land on a space and have to <br/>\npick from one of two piles - rhymes or poems. The rhymes pile says <br/>\nthings like &quot;4 words that rhyme with pig&quot; or have a few lines of <br/>\nsomething from a Seuss book with several words/a phrase underlined <br/>\nand you have to make up a new phrase that rhymes to substitute. Poem <br/>\nsays &quot;make a poem about clouds&quot; or &quot;make a poem using the word blue&quot; <br/>\nor whatever. Lots of fun - we usually ignore the board game part and <br/>\njust flips through cards at random.
