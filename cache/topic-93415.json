I try to keep her days as busy as I can with no <br/>\nguarantee that she will have regular playmates or that she will agree to <br/>\nany of the activities.  Occasionally we do meet up with some girl that we <br/>\nhave seen at other activities and over time they have become friends, and <br/>\nthen they meet outside these activities.  We&#39;re in Girl Scouts, which was <br/>\nfine until this year as the separation between her school friends has <br/>\nwidened into a canyon, so now we go Juliet Lowe(independent).  We are in <br/>\nthe process of starting a homeschool group of Girl Scouts.  We also <br/>\nparticipate in a homeschool cooperative one day a week for science and <br/>\ndrama classes which provides almost a school atmosphere where she meets <br/>\nlots of girls and boys all ages and has made at least one real friend.  She <br/>\npicks the classes and has tried and dropped any number of them.  She goes <br/>\nfor fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe volunteer at an animal shelter once a week during the morning, doing the <br/>\ncat room with two other adults.  My daughter likes animals.  But since she <br/>\nhas started up with horseback riding lessons, and has indicated she would <br/>\nlike to see about working/volunteering at the stable, we&#39;ll probably finish <br/>\noff our year at the shelter and drop that.  There are always girls hanging <br/>\naround the stable so she will probably meet some friends there. <br/>\n(www.volunteermatch.com)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just joined a local rock club that has a junior member section and they <br/>\nhave their own field trips.  There are square dance clubs that often have <br/>\nteen members.  Does your YMCA have a homeschool day?  Some of the local <br/>\nPark and Rec departments in our state have homeschool classes/art classes <br/>\netc.  What about your homeschool support groups in the area?  any <br/>\nactivities they are doing?  I have often joined any number of these just to <br/>\nget their directories and them combed them to looked for any local <br/>\npeople.  I would then email or call them to see if they want to get <br/>\ntogether with me and my daughter....make &quot;playdates.&quot;  Most often they too <br/>\nhave the same problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there&#39;s the internet.  My daughter is major into neopets right <br/>\nnow.  They have a whole website, with their own &quot;neomail&quot; and other kids <br/>\non-line and she and her girl friend often communicate at night this <br/>\nway.  You set up a store and paint it, and get mdse for it and price the <br/>\nmdse and earn points to shop in other people&#39;s stores through playing all <br/>\nthese games, and tons of other stuff that I have no idea about, but she <br/>\nspends hours on it in the middle of the night.  She sets up her own website <br/>\nor something on there and goes to town.  She often talks about the new <br/>\nfriends she has made on-line...and yes, we do talk about all the caveats, <br/>\nand it seems safe and approved.  It is not a chat room.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately though, we talk about how homeschooling isn&#39;t like &quot;school&quot; and <br/>\nhow good that is. We discuss what a friend is.  She has had some bad <br/>\nexperiences with the girls in the neighborhood that she has grown up with, <br/>\nand initially gone to school with.  She doesn&#39;t like these girls anymore, <br/>\nbut is torn between wanting to play with anyone she can and yet knowing how <br/>\nthey treat her.  It&#39;s definitely a growing process.  She knows that she <br/>\nwill never have a whole group of girls like her to &quot;hang out with.&quot;  She <br/>\ntoo would love to have them here right in the neighborhood. But wishing <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to happen.  So you deal with it and do the best you <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also read the book Odd Girl Out by Rachel Simmons.  It gave me <br/>\nexcellent insight into the whole girlfriend paradigm and helped me <br/>\nunderstand why girls/we do some things that they/we do/did when it comes to <br/>\nhaving or being friends.  However, Simmons really needs to do a whole new <br/>\nbook on homeschool girls, as the above book appears to be entirely on <br/>\npublic-schooled girls.
