Finally, so much of &gt;its has become<br/>\na business in and of itself that sometimes it almost &gt;seems that the fact<br/>\nthat learning is supposed to take place there is almost &gt;an afterthought.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, here, David.  And the number of students admitted to any particular<br/>\nprogram or department is not related at all to the amount of students who<br/>\nwant to be there, but is directly proportional to the amount of so-called<br/>\n&quot;jobs&quot; the experts think there will be available, operating on that old<br/>\nscarcity model again.  Never mind where each person&#39;s skills are, or what<br/>\nkind of valuable work they want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has been a social worker with children for almost a decade.  For<br/>\nyears now he has wanted to go back to school to become a secondary ed<br/>\nteacher.  He has tons of experience with kids and a ton of knowledge and<br/>\nlove for the English language, history, folklore, music, and mythology, but<br/>\nthe system is set up to keep him out.  No evening courses, long period of<br/>\nunpaid student teaching required for &quot;state certification&quot;.  And every<br/>\nschool that he has called about teacher certification has had a horrible<br/>\nattitude with him; no effort at all to help him find a way to become a<br/>\nteacher.  I have been shocked at how rude some of these people have been, as<br/>\nI have made a lot of these phone calls.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt disgusts me that these people are in charge of higher education for<br/>\nteachers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with what you said about Steiner, as well, David.  Most of what he<br/>\nwrote was his observations of children.  And a lot of what he wrote about<br/>\nhow children learn very closely resembled John Holt&#39;s ideas about how<br/>\nlearning comes from within and must be meaningful to the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope all is well with you, and looking forward to the release of your book!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nSandra Brown<br/>\nAnn Arbor, MI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2175,"nextTopicId":2394}}
