We have only been<br/>\nhomeschooling for this year, but the difference it has made is<br/>\nunbelievable, I to, have had a problem admiting we are unschooling as<br/>\npeople get so weird when you try to explain that your children are<br/>\nlearning and are not neglected, but I have reached the point where what<br/>\nis good for my kids makes it easier for me to deal with disapproval. I am<br/>\nlucky to have the support of my mom and mil, my sister in law has hsed<br/>\nfor 16 years, so she laid the path for the rest of us. As a family (I<br/>\nhave 8 childre) we have made a commitment to continue the wonder of<br/>\nteaching our children ourselves. btw I had my first child a month after I<br/>\nturned 17 and my last 2 months before I turned 36, I play as much with<br/>\nhim as I did with her, I think it really is about how you feel about<br/>\nyourself and life inside.<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 100 years it will not matter what kind of car I drove,<br/>\nwhere I lived or how much money I had, but<br/>\nThe world may be better because I made the difference in the life of a<br/>\nchild!<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
