Oldest one<br/>\nand I were discussing how we would fare if it were our family.<br/>\nWe figured pretty darned good because I know I could cook and bake on<br/>\nthat range (Mother-in-law had a coal and wood stove I&#39;ve experience with<br/>\nand I&#39;ve cooked on open fires successfully  so a more *controled* range<br/>\nwould be simpler), we have enough hobbies that would fit in to the<br/>\nVictorian era ( knitting, embroidery, puzzles, painting, reading etc ),<br/>\nwe like each other enough that we could put up with each other for the<br/>\nthree months.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are doing a couple of similar projects here in Canada .... one in<br/>\nManitoba where a family (maybe it was three families) will live in a<br/>\ntotally pioneer lifestyle and one I believe in Newfoundland where they<br/>\nwill live as the vikings who landed there would have.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got rid of cable in favour of a satellite dish service. Best choice<br/>\nwe&#39;ve made in a long time, don&#39;t know why we didn&#39;t do it when they<br/>\nfirst came out (serviced dishes not the giant point and aim dishes).<br/>\nNow we get two PBS feeds east coast and west coast so we never miss a<br/>\nprogram. It&#39;s always on later for us to watch or tape.<br/>\nWe get every Canadian province&#39;s version of PBS too which is wayyyy<br/>\ncool!<br/>\n<br/>\nbuzz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   <br/>\n The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when <br/>\n Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been <br/>\n Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n Samantha                  B.F.
