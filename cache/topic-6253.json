The suggestions are wonderful and give a <br/>\nbroad range of reading materials.  Read-alouds and Read-alones.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started with the Level 3 (American History), just because my kids love <br/>\nthe AMerican Girl Dolls and books.  Sonlight starts Am. History with the <br/>\nAztecs/Incas and Mayans, so we get a very thorough foundation.  The books <br/>\nwere easily found at the library, for the most part.  There are one or two <br/>\nwe will have to buy through Sonlight, because that is the only place we can <br/>\nfind them.  Even for us, as &quot;radical&quot; unschoolers, this is a very nice <br/>\nprogram.  We spend time reading daily anyway, this just focuses our reading <br/>\ninto a cohesive &quot;unit&quot; so that they are absorbing a lot of information.  We <br/>\ndon&#39;t always follow the Teacher&#39;s Guide, but use it more as a reference for <br/>\ngood books on the subjects.  You could actually probably use their catalogue <br/>\nas a reference too - it lists everything they recommend using for different <br/>\nsubjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Natrlmama@aol.com","from":"Natrlmama@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nOmLPoTdUnL8T2QOOu1hgu-qzo2b-kVNPWc_ji4WQ0kGeFi_dz8_i-cRHwjTjQBd8AtnbA_8YNw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sullivan Readers","postDate":"950079646","msgId":6319,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MDkuNjMxOS45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6290,"nextInTopic":6330,"prevInTime":6318,"nextInTime":6320,"topicId":6253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 02/06/2000 11:40:05 PM Pacific Standard Time, heathfam@direct.ca writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2143348300\">In a message dated 02/06/2000 11:40:05 PM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heathfam@...\">heathfam@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n And of course I am interested in hearing other suggestions for materials<br/>\n that might qualify as &quot;curriculum&quot; but are still creative and/or interesting<br/>\n for kids.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sonlight curriculum ( www.sonlight).
