Adopting the ban on metadiscussions as <br/>\ndescribed in your post would be very good for the list. You have my vote.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\n<br/>\nn a message dated 8/13/02 8:42:21 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beanmom@...\">beanmom@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m a list newbie who&#39;s been lurking for a few weeks and I agree<br/>\n&gt; with the above, particularly #2.  There is a concept called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;metadiscussion&quot;, i.e. talking about how people are talking.  I am on<br/>\n&gt; many lists where there is a strict ban on metadiscussion, because<br/>\n&gt; (as everyone here has seen) once people start criticizing the WAY<br/>\n&gt; someone posted or the SUBJECT someone posted about rather than<br/>\n&gt; discussing issues and topics, things generally devolve into acrimony<br/>\n&gt; and name-calling.  Here is a sample of the metadiscussion policy from<br/>\n&gt; one list:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Posting styles are not up for discussion on [this list]. Keep in mind it <br/>\n&gt; is not possible for any one person on the [x] list to post in a way which <br/>\n&gt; takes into account everyone&#39;s feelings. It is not OK to challenge or <br/>\n&gt; criticize someone else&#39;s posting style On List. If you feel offended by a <br/>\n&gt; post someone sent to the list and you feel a need to let that person know <br/>\n&gt; how offended you are, please do it Off List. If you are offended by the <br/>\n&gt; &#39;tone&#39; of the list and you feel you must address this, please address it <br/>\n&gt; off list with those who you feel are setting the overall &#39;tone&#39; you <br/>\n&gt; perceive. It is not your job to moderate the [x] list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please do not discuss which [listname] Posts or Topics are Off Topic for <br/>\n&gt; the [x] List on the [x] List. If anyone wants to conduct an email <br/>\n&gt; discussion of which Posts or Topics are suitable for [this list], how often <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; these Posts or Topics should come up, and the number of Posts that should <br/>\n&gt; be assigned to a Topic in any given period of time, please take it to <br/>\n&gt; private email. Please remember that not all Posts or Topics are going to <br/>\n&gt; interest everyone on the [x] List. If you don&#39;t like a Post or Topic or if <br/>\n&gt; you are not interested in a Post or Topic, or if you find the Post or Topic <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; distasteful, or if you believe the Post or Topic to be Off Topic, or if you <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; believe the Post or Topic is too boring, simply make it disappear with the <br/>\n&gt; Delete Key. If you are sick and tired of reading Posts or topics which <br/>\n&gt; appear to dominate the list, feel free to introduce a new Post containing a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; New Topic. If the New Topic doesn&#39;t take off, feel free to keep introducing <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; New Topics.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been skimming and deleting Ned&#39;s posts, because I&#39;m mostly less<br/>\n&gt; than interested in what he&#39;s been writing about.  But I&#39;ve also been<br/>\n&gt; using the delete key liberally on all the posts DISCUSSING Ned&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; posts, because they&#39;re virtually content-free, at least as relates to<br/>\n&gt; my reason for coming to this list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And here I am, metadiscussing.  ;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -jennifer, mommy to alice the bean, 8/15/97,<br/>\n&gt;                 and sammy-girl, 6/4/02<br/>\n&gt;               <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.beanmom.com/\">http://www.beanmom.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40902,"nextTopicId":41002}}
