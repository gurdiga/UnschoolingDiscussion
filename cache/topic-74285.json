Wait a minute here.  Your experience with science is so sad.  So was mine.  I find it easy to believe that you were taught that at university.  I taught at Michigan State (as an undergraduate), Iowa State (as a graduate student), and at Columbus State Community College (as an adjunct professor).   I taught freshman chemistry for years.  Freshman chemistry at the college level is about one-third history, one-third review (element names and symbols, density, algebra review), and one-third new material.  And if you get a poor instructor you need to show your work just the way they showed on the blackboard to get partial credit.  Undergraduate science courses and some graduate courses are about teaching dogma.  There is one true answer and only one true answer.  I was still arguing with the professor about multiple ways to solve a problem in graduate school!  (He wasn&#39;t a shining example of a good teacher.)  <br/>\n<br/>\n  There is a huge gulf between science as it is taught (especially undergraduate and lower) and real-life.  I&#39;m still a little bitter about this.  I did well in high school science courses and was strongly encouraged to major in science.  But doing well in high school courses has little relevance to being a practicing scientist.  In fact, I did well at the courses in high school and undergraduate and graduate school and failed when it was time to do it for real.  Science as found in research labs doesn&#39;t look at all like the coursework I took.  It  is full of lively debates about experiment design, interpretation of results, proper sampling. etc.  Real scientists don&#39;t agree in fact they argue ALL the time.  In fact, that&#39;s partly why I am not a scientist anymore.  I don&#39;t like arguing all the time and defending my opinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT, there is nothing wrong with using scientific terms.  Just because in your experience they were used to stifle dissension doesn&#39;t mean there is anything wrong with the terms or the ideas inside of them.  And people who cite the scientific method are sometimes just saying I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong.  I look at what people do with the scientific method and then make up my mind.  And in this case, I strongly agree with Deborah.  Yes, it&#39;s fun to explore what personality types the people on this list are.  It&#39;s fun to see what the poll results are.  It is wildly inappropriate to extrapolate these results to unschoolers across the country because of this self-selected bias.  The best example I know of self-selected bias is unemployment figures.  When I was looking for a job, the unemployment rate reported by the American Chemical Society based on a survey of its members (who weren&#39;t called just mailed in a form) was approximately 2%.

I found them to be based upon all that scientific &quot;discussion&quot; I heard over and over in university.  I don&#39;t want anyone reading your remarks to stop exploring because 1) they have to consider it scientific to be worthy   2) they have to avoid drawing false conclusions at all times.  In my experience, when science enters into personal exploration the work stops.  If this discussion was about astrology (which is very unscientific) and people were learning to be happy inside their own bodies/skin, then would you stop the discussion with comments of validity and reliability?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And what did ANY of your examples have to do with drawing conclusions about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>what kind of people are drawn to unschooling from answers to a poll given by 2% <br/>\nor less of an email discussion list that is a self selected sample of <br/>\nunschoolers to start with??? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, not one word, but you used the lexicon of science, &quot;slightly more likely&quot; which is probability.

The power of the word SHOULD is legendary and I despise it&#39;s use.

Heisenburg got close with this &quot;Uncertainty&quot; principle - when the scientists participates in the world s/he affects the results.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeard a quote this morning on CrossCountry Check-up (CBC Radio) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/checkup/\">http://www.cbc.ca/checkup/</a> that &quot;feelings are a mode of thinking and so is thinking.&quot;  Something like that.  As an NF I am ranting on the devaluing of feeling as a means of thinking.  AND SO WHAT if I draw a conclusion.  A woman (her name anyone?) scientist was given a Nobel Prize in Science/Genetics for her work with beans.  She was in her 80&#39;s before any recognized that by &quot;befriending&quot; and &quot;nurturing&quot; her beans she had advanced genetics greatly, but was ignored - too &quot;unscientific.&quot; DAMN that mind!!!Not only limits my world, but reduces all our reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thinking in medicine.  1988 and Tim and Maureen have Brianna.  After one week, she&#39;s screaming in pain!  Off to the doc.  Don&#39;t know.  Maybe it&#39;s colic. Months pass with Bri bringing women running across Hillside Mall (hi, Tia!) to help the new-born get its fingers out of the door.  Nope, just us!  :O((((   At 19 months my Grandmother is crying that it looks like her g-grand-d is dying.  She&#39;s seen it before and she&#39;s freaked.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to the doctor&#39;s for mysterious fever, rashes, and ask about the possibility that she&#39;s allergic to something.  I quote the Scientific Method Mavens: &quot;There is no such thing.  We&#39;ve proven that unless you are anaphalactic, it&#39;s not possible.&quot;  Baby gets a weeping/bleeding diaper rash from shoulder blades to back-o-knees.  GP referes us to Dermatologist (Vic General, Tia) takes one cursory look AND tells us IT IS FRIKKIN&#39; IN-GROWN HAIR FOLICLES!!!!&quot;  (My emphasis, not his.)  Ah, the scientific method hard at work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a really nasty human being of a naturopath told Maureen to take her off milk when Bri was 21 mon.  It helped (but not completely.)  (Soon learned that milk and milk ingred&#39;s are in all commercial formulas etc.) Told the medico-doc that it helped.  He ranted all over us about the virtues of milk (now understand that the milk producers bought the doctors off in the 30&#39;s 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s) and the BEST quote was &quot;there is absolutely no way a cow&#39;s milk molecule can get thru a woman&#39;s breast.&quot;  Whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then I only use the Sci Method sparingly and never ever to make real decisions at work.  I know thru feeling, but that&#39;s a lot more complex that &quot;happy/sad/scared.&quot;  It&#39;s ethics, intuition, and caring (feeling + action = caring).
