My own family struggles with different sicknesses that have been difficult to handle without meds.  ADD, my brother; MS/depression, my sister; depression,  my other brother;  and fibromyalgia/depression, me.  <br/>\nI probably could get by without meds if I only had to take care of myself, but when we threw in 3 children..my health was what went.  <br/>\nI used to think if I really tried I could do it without meds, but you know what?  I couldn&#39;t.  And without it, my children and family suffered.  <br/>\nSo I also think there is a tendency to over medicate but there is a place for meds sometimes too.  We can easily generalize and say the natural way is best, but if the quality of a persons life is being compromised, such as a child feeling unloved, as what happened to me growing up.....I say bring on the medication!!  I am such a better, laid back person, my kids enjoy me and I enjoy them.  When I can get more sleep, get more exercise and just plain take care of myself more,,, then I might beable to go off, but for now, this is what&#39;s best for me.<br/>\nI suppose this has been said before to those of you who have been on the list for a long time but I felt like I needed to say it.

I am new to the list and have been reading digests for two days and really wanted to add my two cents to this particular topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years ago a teacher &quot;diagnosed&quot; my son as having ADHD. The doctors took this diagnosis as gospel and I was bullied at the hands of DSS into medicating him. It has not worked and my son&#39;s &quot;misbehavior&quot; has only escalated. That is why I am taking him out of public school system. This is such an overused label.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have bipolar disorder. A real doctor diagnosed this problem after tests and many sessions of me explaining how &quot;weird&quot; I am, how many days on end I do not sleep and how much stuff I get done and exactly what I call risk taking behaviors. But this is something I rarely share this with others because the label &quot;Bipolar&quot; get so misused in the popular media that people have asked me some pretty strange questions. People think those with bipolar disorder are prone to be mass murderers, can&#39;t have kids, never marry and are completely deranged, only being marginally normal because of the miracle of the drug, Lithium.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that I allowed myself to be minimally medicated so that I would sleep occasionally and so that I can function as a quasi- normal parent. I have a child, have been married three times, have never killed any one and I only get mildly deranged while suffering once a month from PMS (According to my son that&#39;s Pre Monster Syndrome). I can laugh at the label I have. My son cannot laugh at his.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis label is all over his school paperwork. Teachers make assumptions right from the beginning when they see that label and it colors their interaction for the rest of the year. They say my son is disruptive. I have been in class and witnessed this. He is excited to be learning and not shy about speaking out. He is impatient to show you that he knows the answer and gets frustrated with classmates who lag behind. He is ready to move on.right now. It causes problems, to be sure. But he is not being the monster that they describe in notes home to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is this whole hyperactivity thing. He can&#39;t sit still. yes. I agree. So let the kid move. To her credit, his first grade teacher would let him move to a carpet near the books when he got too fidgety in his desk. He still participated in class while he was reading something totally off topic from the carpeted area. He was bothering no one. He was not disruptive and he passed the first grade with flying colors. except for writing. The kid&#39;s penmanship is atrocious. So what? I can read it.barely&lt;G&gt;. Mine is lousy too. I am a writer with the penmanship of a doctor. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs adults, when someone hangs us with a label we can choose whether or not to accept it, embrace it or ignore it. But when a child gets hung with a label they do not get to choose. I am not blind. Something is wrong with my son. He has wild mood swings, erratic moods, violent outbursts and unexplained crying spells. at school. It is not as bad or as pronounced at home. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have finally found a doctor who will really listen to what we are telling him about our son. And eventually we will get to the heart of the problem and heal it. But until then I wish we could just get educators to drop these labels.
