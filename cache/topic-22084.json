For instance, although not many of us <br/>\nquestion our doctors, there is a growing flood of people willing to <br/>\naddress their concerns, challenge their doctors, and expect better <br/>\ncare where years before they would never have even thought to <br/>\nquestion. Change - even slow, slow change - has to start with <br/>\nsomething; some small gesture.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad a teacher been unwilling to give me their curriculum outline at <br/>\nthe beginning of the school year, I would have run straight to the <br/>\nprincipal and/or the school board and demanded it.

And <br/>\nthe schools and the teachers knew me and what I expected out of the <br/>\nschool and them. And I got it. Not so much because I &#39;knew the ropes&#39; <br/>\nbut because I was persistent.  Of course, I was known as &#39;that <br/>\nmother&#39; and, I&#39;m sure, worse names.

I had an epiphany <br/>\nthat perhaps he\u000f<br/>\nshould read just in his head, develop an actual (gasp) <br/>\nenjoyment of reading\u000f<br/>\nand then his reading would progress. Well - this worked <br/>\nfor exactly two days\u000f<br/>\nwhen he came home announcing that his teacher forbade <br/>\nhim from reading the\u000f<br/>\nbooks I picked out (Amelia Bedlia of all things) <br/>\nbecause they were &quot;too\u000f<br/>\nadvanced&quot; for him and now he will not read at all. I <br/>\nfought and fought but\u000f<br/>\nit will just be one of those things that can wait. He <br/>\nneeds to be\u000f<br/>\nde-schooled because right now he firmly believes that <br/>\nhis teacher is the\u000f<br/>\nword of God and the end all be all of learning. She has <br/>\nmore power in my own\u000f<br/>\nhome than I have and that is just messed up. Like <br/>\nsomeone said - it&#39;s not\u000f<br/>\nlike I&#39;m exposing him to porn. It was Amelia Bedilia. <br/>\nFinally, the teacher\u000f<br/>\nbacked down and agreed he could read those books *as <br/>\nlong as* he was reading\u000f<br/>\nthem - out loud - to me. He was specifically NOT <br/>\nallowed to read in his\u000f<br/>\nhead. I will not even go into how totally absurd this <br/>\nis. I mean WHO the\u000f<br/>\nhell (besides people who record audio books for a <br/>\nliving) needs to be\u000f<br/>\nproficient readers out loud. He spends SO much time <br/>\ntrying to get\u000f<br/>\nintonation, fluency and emphasis correct that progress <br/>\nis totally lost (as\u000f<br/>\nis enjoyment - the real issue to me).

This is his regular goodbye for us. He thinks<br/>\nthis is cool, I think it&#39;s terrifying. Especially last week when my 3yo<br/>\nslept peacefully in my bed during a tornado that *I* knew was way north of<br/>\nus while my 6yo was hovering in a restroom wondering if his school was going<br/>\nto be demolished by a tornado for an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be much easier to take this POV if the teachers were supportive but<br/>\nthey act VERY taken aback or challenged or insulted or something. I refuse<br/>\nto speak to them about it because frankly it is none of their business. But<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid I am becoming rather adversarial and have even stooped to telling<br/>\nDalton that these are people we hire to do a job for us - not parent my<br/>\nchildren or tell me how I can spend my spare time with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe case in point that I referred to, by the way, was that my son was having<br/>\ntrouble progressing with his reading. I had an epiphany that perhaps he<br/>\nshould read just in his head, develop an actual (gasp) enjoyment of reading<br/>\nand then his reading would progress. Well - this worked for exactly two days<br/>\nwhen he came home announcing that his teacher forbade him from reading the<br/>\nbooks I picked out (Amelia Bedlia of all things) because they were &quot;too<br/>\nadvanced&quot; for him and now he will not read at all. I fought and fought but<br/>\nit will just be one of those things that can wait. He needs to be<br/>\nde-schooled because right now he firmly believes that his teacher is the<br/>\nword of God and the end all be all of learning. She has more power in my own<br/>\nhome than I have and that is just messed up. Like someone said - it&#39;s not<br/>\nlike I&#39;m exposing him to porn. It was Amelia Bedilia. Finally, the teacher<br/>\nbacked down and agreed he could read those books *as long as* he was reading<br/>\nthem - out loud - to me. He was specifically NOT allowed to read in his<br/>\nhead. I will not even go into how totally absurd this is. I mean WHO the<br/>\nhell (besides people who record audio books for a living) needs to be<br/>\nproficient readers out loud. He spends SO much time trying to get<br/>\nintonation, fluency and emphasis correct that progress is totally lost (as<br/>\nis enjoyment - the real issue to me). Take away fluency, intonation and<br/>\nproper emphasis and he&#39;s a GREAT little reader who (for awhile anyway -<br/>\nuntil his teacher brainwashed him) really enjoyed reading and had full<br/>\ncomprehension.

Those are almost always<br/>\nself-initiated learning experiences. Obviously they were exposed to<br/>\nSOMEthing in life to develop the interest in the first place but it usually<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a unit or lesson or classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, off the bat I can tell you my 3yo is passionate about<br/>\ndinosaurs and bugs. I did not intentionally expose my child to those things<br/>\nin the hopes of creating a passion. I exposed him to those things as parts<br/>\nof life, reading, movies, gardening, whatever. I can&#39;t predict what will be<br/>\nhis next passion. When he does develop his new passions at this level I do<br/>\nnot interfere much unless he asks (and he will!). He has a &quot;bug jar&quot; he made<br/>\nat our homeschooling group&#39;s garden that he keeps in his room and spends a<br/>\nlarge portion of his day digging silently by himself in the dirt in our yard<br/>\nfinding new creatures and adding them to his jar. Sometimes he&#39;ll ask about<br/>\na bug and we&#39;ll research it a bit. Eventually he&#39;ll dump out his jar and let<br/>\nhis friends free and start over. Last month it was worms and he wanted to<br/>\nsee what compost looks like so we kept the worms for a month and then let<br/>\nthem back in our garden. Dinosaurs - same thing. We have tons of books,<br/>\nvideos (Nat&#39;l Geographic has great dino videos), toys and visit every dino<br/>\nexhibit that comes near our city. I&#39;m not much interested in dinos or bugs<br/>\nmyself :) but his love of learning is contagious and I&#39;ve learned a lot<br/>\nthrough osmosis :). It&#39;s also been contagious enough to revitalize a love of<br/>\nbugs and dinos in my 6yo. But we don&#39;t do unit studies on these things or<br/>\nspecifically set of formal learning. We just learn through living, doing,<br/>\nfollowing what makes sense and what drives us.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nicki Clark","from":"&quot;Nicki Clark&quot; &lt;nicki@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"hTFYhzT6jkGCWwuAt1jWQGTx9aiadVDT_inZoPKaubPKC1smAitwZ7Cijmwfq-DA_NZNIj0ogFnCCat9vCUmsPE5TlHgaYLNS5bSgg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Intro","postDate":"991075882","msgId":22089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFFRU1JTUFDSUxPTUlMTERHTklOQ0VFT0NQQUEubmlja2lAZGV0cm9pdG1hbWEuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzLjE1ZDBlYWVmLjI4NDNiNzYyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22084,"nextInTopic":22090,"prevInTime":22088,"nextInTime":22090,"topicId":22084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone - I m coming out of a loooong lurkdom for a quick intro.

How to teach them spelling, <br/>\n&gt;  vocabulary, phonograms to help them read.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*I* teach spelling by waiting &#39;til my son asks, &quot;How do you spell (whatever) <br/>\nand then I tell him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are there &quot;tools&quot; you do <br/>\n&gt;  use to help them learn? Do you limit their TV/computer game time?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We limit TV by not having one, but I don&#39;t limit computer time at all. We <br/>\nhave no computer games and no sound on our computer, which keeps the noise <br/>\nlevel down considerably.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you go to the library a lot?  I guess I&#39;m just having trouble <br/>\n&gt;  imagineing my kids initiating a &quot;learning experience&quot;!  Does <br/>\n&gt;  unschooling put them behind academically?  I mean, you want them to be<br/>\n&gt;  able to basic adding and subtracting by a certain age and then <br/>\n&gt;  multiplying and dividing by another age, right?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, we go to the library a lot (usually--haven&#39;t in about 6 weeks though). <br/>\nWe have no age by which we expect them to achieve certain milestones. My son <br/>\nis focused on words and numbers right now, but he also goes months without <br/>\nthinking of anything but vehicles, which I also respect. I figure he learned <br/>\nto talk just fine without &quot;lessons.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a different mindset!<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22082,"nextTopicId":22119}}
