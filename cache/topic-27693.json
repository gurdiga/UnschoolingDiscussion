I agree that<br/>\nsome are mature enough to handle this.  My oldest is not yet 10,  but we&#39;ve<br/>\nstarted talking about what  her parameters would be when she is old enough<br/>\nto be left for short time periods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis boy,  however,  had no idea when his father would return,  had no way<br/>\nto contact him in an emergency,  did not know his mother&#39;s cell number (she<br/>\nwas out of town anyway),  and his father had not notified any neighbor to be<br/>\na backup in case of emergency...or in case of anything...like needing to use<br/>\na bathroom!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance:<br/>\nYou are on the same page with me in needing to vant about this!  I was<br/>\nFUMING angry!!  And wanted to sort it out before acting....and wanted to<br/>\nmake sure the child is toip priority.....ands wanted to maintain a positive<br/>\nrelationship with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lived behind them for almost 10 years,  so I&#39;ve known him almost his<br/>\nwhole life.  And I have seen his parents struggle all along.  His father is<br/>\na heavy drinker...well,  let&#39;s not mince this...he&#39;s an alcoholic.  His mom<br/>\nworks 2nd shift about 4 nights/week.  She is in big-time denial and talking<br/>\nto her has never helped in the past.  I had a &#39;little run-in&#39;  with the Dad<br/>\na few weeks ago because his sons play here at least five out of 7<br/>\ndays/week....they don&#39;t ever call,  just show up on the street (So dad can<br/>\nsay,  well,  I never sent them to your house,  just your street.)  I&#39;ve had<br/>\nto drop his kids off with him,  knowing he&#39;s asleep on the couch (in early<br/>\nevening or afternoon, anytime)  but he&#39;s &#39;asleep&#39; from drunkenness.  I have<br/>\nseen this neglect get worse over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an attatchment to the kids...I think foster care would not be a good<br/>\nlife....I feel the father would retaliate (against several neighbors if he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t figure out who called),  and I fear this.  And I know how difficult<br/>\nit is for social services/CPS workers to be able to get evidence,<br/>\nespecially of neglect.  The son would be called a liar by his father and the<br/>\nsocial worker would not have anything clear to go on,  and the boy&#39;s<br/>\nconfusing world would probably become more so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha said:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; So I might connect up with the Mom when she gets back<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and say. Your son got locked out of the house when you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were out of town. I would be happy to keep an xtra key<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for the kids so they can get in the house when they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get locked out. Build a connection if you feel up to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it. That&#39;s what community is about isn&#39;t? It&#39;s what I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would hope I would have the courage to do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I thank you for your calm, reasonable approach,  which is the path I usually<br/>\nprefer.  As I stated earlier,  the mom is not reasonable to talk with since<br/>\nshe&#39;s deeply entrenched in the ruse of denial...about the neglect,<br/>\nabuse(?), the drinking.  I know he at least abuse her verbally,  it&#39;s<br/>\nhorrible to see and hear..who knows what else may happen behind closed<br/>\ndoors?  Several neighbors do tend to &#39;watch out&#39; for the kids....it&#39;s a<br/>\nbalancing act......trying to figure out what&#39;s best for the family.  Would a<br/>\ncall to CPS wake them up?  I wish I knew it would,  I&#39;d do it.  My immediate<br/>\n&#39;feeling&#39; was to lock that dad up and hope he&#39;s removed....but it was a<br/>\nvisceral response.<br/>\nOTOH, someone asked me how I&#39;d feel if something happens to one of the kids<br/>\nwhile he&#39;s neglecting them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Nance:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sounds likes a better solution to me.

Alone!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was one of the half-days of ps.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In our first encounter I asked where his Mom or Dad were -- &quot;Oh, Dad&#39;s at<br/>\n&gt; work until 6:00 and Mom&#39;s at work too.&quot;  OK -- half day of school.  He&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; alone until 6:00, from 1:00 on.  This was about 1:30 -- he could have been<br/>\n&gt; missing until 6:00 before anyone even knew!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ack.  I did the wrong thing and told him to come back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I should have just had him wait out on the front deck.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I called the school.
