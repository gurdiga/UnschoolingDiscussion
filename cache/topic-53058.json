How can we ensure that the rights of the child are respected in<br/>\nrelation to their educational provision?**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see them frankly admit that standardized government<br/>\neducation is not the best way to meet the learning needs of all children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, since a government institution is self-preserving, I&#39;d like for<br/>\nparents and/or children to have explicitly the decision-making power<br/>\nabout their schooling.  (I don&#39;t believe anyone who works for the school<br/>\ncan make consistently unbiased decisions in the interests of children. <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to go down that road at all, if it can be avoided.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  (They may be inclinded to &quot;compromise&quot; and not ever give you 100% of<br/>\nwhat you ask for.  So, ask for the moon!  Ask for a shorter school day<br/>\nand more community-based, beyond the classroom learning for ALL students.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53056,"nextTopicId":53061}}
