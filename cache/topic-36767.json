When we read the books we <br/>\npronounced it entirely differently than it is pronounced in the movie. <br/>\n One of my local groups even had a discussion about how it was <br/>\nsupposed to be pronounced.  We had four or five different ways and <br/>\nnone of them were the way it is in the movie!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also know that people who read a lot often mispronounce words they <br/>\nhave only read and never heard.  My girls would get annoyed if we <br/>\ncorrected them, until I told them about when I was about 9 and read <br/>\nthe word  bungalow.  My mom asked what I was reading and I said, &quot;The <br/>\nBungalow Mystery&quot;.  I put the g and l with the a and stressed the <br/>\nmiddle sylable.  Like this: bun-GAL-o<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now whenever I correct the girl&#39;s pronunciation, they say bun-GAL-o <br/>\nout loud and remember that everyone needs a little help sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH&#39;s word is coincide.  He says it as if he is doing bad things to <br/>\nquarters, nichels and dimes.
