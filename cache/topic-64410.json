First option is to talk with <br/>\nthe other person.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that does not work, second option is to find me or another adult. If that <br/>\ndoes not work<br/>\n<br/>\nthen you can hit. So when he starts hitting, I ask him what he tried <br/>\nfirst...usually he<br/>\n<br/>\ndid ask Kyle to stop doing something so I can ask him what he should have <br/>\ntried next. And<br/>\n<br/>\nthat is the step he usually skips. ;o) But it gives us a good framework to <br/>\ntalk about<br/>\n<br/>\nhow he had other options then hitting. I think that often at 6 he can&#39;t see <br/>\nthe other<br/>\n<br/>\noptions so this helps remind him and helps us talk about them. Not a cure <br/>\nall, but it is<br/>\n<br/>\ngetting better. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the boys were little and I was trying to figure out how to say &quot;Yes&quot; a <br/>\nlot and not no, I came up with that once when Kirby said he REALLY wanted to <br/>\nhit Marty.  Somehow it came around to &quot;when can I hit him?&quot;  I said You can <br/>\nhit him (which was the answer Kirby REALLY wanted!) IF first you try to talk <br/>\nto him and if that doesn&#39;t work you get a grownup to try to help you settle <br/>\nit, and if THAT doesn&#39;t work, then  you can hit him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if he hit Marty (or the other way) the main offense was that they didn&#39;t <br/>\nfollow procedure.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as I had suspected, they never got past the grownup-assistance stage, so <br/>\nthe stage three never materialized.  But I suppose the boys sometimes had <br/>\nhope that it would.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64210,"nextTopicId":64155}}
