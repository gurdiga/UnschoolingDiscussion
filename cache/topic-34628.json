You may step back and view the entire world-not just your <br/>\nhome, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a <br/>\nlaboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, <br/>\nanimals, history, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a <br/>\nbook), music, art , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, <br/>\nand ideas without end. Although collections of these treasures have been <br/>\nlocated in museums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere <br/>\nelse, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice <br/>\nwhen your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make <br/>\nmistakes, and to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children <br/>\nto experience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them <br/>\nsomething to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nHenceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything <br/>\nyou start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be diked up again at <br/>\nany time in the future (or never). <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>\nfeel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>\nharm. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to <br/>\nthink theirs. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>\nprivileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>\ncreating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to <br/>\nobtain approval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen <br/>\nothers do are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was originally a single-use thing, designed for distribution in a certain <br/>\nworkshop.

But <br/>\nthat one single change seemed to me to show a lack of faith in real-world <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey put &quot; Although collections of these treasures have been located in <br/>\nlibraries and museums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere <br/>\nelse, too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLIBRARIES FIRST, even before museums.<br/>\nBut still said it was written by me. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, it&#39;s a (minor) problem because people who learn to use the whole <br/>\nworld will certainly consider libraries to be a part of that, but those who <br/>\nstay library-dependent might not venture far beyond.
