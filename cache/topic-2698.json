I am well aware that for some<br/>\npeople who call themselves &quot;unschoolers,&quot; my way of thinking might be<br/>\nconsidered politically incorrect.  (BIG WOOOOoooo!)[Image]<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this whole question of how to &quot;unschool&quot; math and writing begs a<br/>\nwhole other question: what precisely is meant by &quot;unschooling?&quot;  To me,<br/>\nit means NOT learning the way public schools try to force rigid learning<br/>\nupon kids.  Unschool = NOT school.  And we do NOT school at my house.<br/>\nWe have fun and learn.  That is why I have chosen the term Natural<br/>\nLearners to describe what we do.  It doesn&#39;t smack of the 60s (unhip<br/>\nuncool ungroovy unschool).  It is a natural term that describes a<br/>\nnatural process.  You don&#39;t need to get hung up on positions of<br/>\nauthority.<br/>\nA mom&#39;s position can naturally be one of guidance.  A kid&#39;s position can<br/>\nnaturally be one of being a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do Saxon math -- well, one of them does. My other kid hates<br/>\nSaxon, but loves math.  So he works out of whatever math book he feels<br/>\nlike using.  My other kid who uses the Saxon book does it about 3 times<br/>\na week.  And she does math worksheets that we got off the internet.  It<br/>\nis a cute little program called Math Worksheet Factory Deluxe, and you<br/>\ncan customize problems, how many digits in addends, minuends, factors,<br/>\ndivisors and the like.  It does fractions, decimals and percentages, so<br/>\nI can use it for my 12 year old son also.  They LIKE their math sheets<br/>\nand they ASK for them.  But it was initially MY direction that they do<br/>\nthem.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with things being adult led<br/>\npart of the time.  Hey, we all take turns!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe play &quot;Math Monopoly&quot; around here. Before you take your turn, you work<br/>\none of your math problems.  I had a highschooler, a 6th grader and a 5th<br/>\ngrader all playing together, with their various levels of math.  The<br/>\nhighschooler used her Harold Jacobs Algebra book  for her problems<br/>\nbefore turns.  The 6th grader did long division with 2 digits in the<br/>\ndivisor and 3 digits in the dividend (did I say that right?) and the 5th<br/>\ngrader did multiplication with decimals.  They played for 2 hours<br/>\nstraight.  I didn&#39;t ask them to.  I didn&#39;t stop them.  They were having<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the book Family Math.  I have Harold Jacob&#39;s books on Algebra and<br/>\nalso on Mathematics: A human Endevour.  I have a GREAT book called The<br/>\nAmazing Book of Shapes.  I also have the books How Math Works, Rapid<br/>\nMath Tricks and a couple of books by that human calculator guy whose<br/>\nname I can&#39;t remember.  All the kids use all of these books at some<br/>\npoint when learning about math.  The 10 and 12 year old like them as<br/>\nmuch as the 14 and 15 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I definitely fostered in them an initial interest in mathematics.<br/>\nAt times, there were some activities I intentionally restricted until<br/>\nmath was done. (In the early years, from preschool through 9, natural<br/>\ndaily activities incorporate so much math that very little restrictions<br/>\nneed to be made.  The kids pretty much generate mathematical concepts on<br/>\ntheir own and play with the ideas, working them into games and<br/>\nstrategies.  But at some point, it is OK to introduce a more focused<br/>\napproach.  And at THAT moment, I pushed, without any qualms.  I<br/>\nencouraged.  I let them know that a certain standard in mathematics is<br/>\nwithout question to be acheived.  And they rose to the occasion.  My<br/>\nkids are NOT mathphobic at all.  They do it with pride.  And of their<br/>\nown initiative, they ask for math worksheets or play one of the many<br/>\nmath computer games we have (I downloaded a bunch of cool freebies off<br/>\nthe internet, I bought Mathblaster and we have some old DOS based games<br/>\nthat run on an ancient 386.  These are mainly word problem games.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith writing, we used Charlotte Mason&#39;s narrative method for years.  We<br/>\nstill use it, but this fall I am absolutely requiring them to come up<br/>\nwith 2 written paragraphs a day.  (Which winds up being about 3 times a<br/>\nweek with all the other stuff we do).  They write the paragraphs, I<br/>\ncorrect them, and the copy over the final draft with corrections.  I<br/>\nfigure that is not too much to ask of a 10 and 12 year old.  But this<br/>\nmoment was a LONG time coming.  We talked about it for 2 years, so there<br/>\nwere NO surprises when I said, &quot;OK, guys.  Now it REALLY IS time for 2<br/>\nparagraphs a day!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOur time is SO free and SO fluid, and we have SO much fun.  I don&#39;t have<br/>\nany problem with pushing the kids in areas where I know they need work.<br/>\nIt is for their own good.  Kids are kids.  They don&#39;t know what is<br/>\ncoming down the pike.  I can see further ahead.  I&#39;ve been there.  To<br/>\nme, unschooling is NOT synonymous with &quot;unguided.&quot;   Guides are useful.<br/>\nJust ask Lewis and Clark!  Any time you are in unfamiliar territory and<br/>\nyou want to get your bearings, it helps to have an experienced person<br/>\naround.  I view my position as mentor and mom(predominantly MOM!).  I<br/>\nsupport.  I uplift.  I let go.  AND I give guidance and direction, when<br/>\nneeded.  That is my job.  Their job is to explore, play, laugh,<br/>\ndiscover, work, develop, grow, be happy, be sad, be mad, be a KID!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for what it&#39;s worth, that is our style of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDJ</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jeff & Diane Gwirtz","from":"&quot;Jeff & Diane Gwirtz&quot; &lt;jagwirtz@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"JJRTSvcCbz4jZ1y7SpwbvaDD6ScAkKrmYul8VQnQOP9qOjgPGzwDRMUulfmTSTf01ph-TT37ABSL0V7VBOuMRrf6Q990ewismejuRP1gXw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: MATH AND WRITING -- WASSUP WIT DAT?","postDate":"936714354","msgId":2707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTQuMjcwNy45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2705,"nextInTopic":2709,"prevInTime":2706,"nextInTime":2708,"topicId":2698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I try not to get hung up on what defines <br/>\npure unschooling.  I know what it means for my family and that may be <br/>\ndifferent from yours,  but we&#39;re both just doing what works for us.<br/>\nI like the term natural learners.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t require writing and math like you do,  but I also don&#39;t <br/>\nconsider our unschooling unguided.  I think it was Lisa who mentioned <br/>\nthe constant conversations we have with our kids about their goals <br/>\nand how they get from point A to point B.  Ds just picked up an <br/>\nEnglish book off our bookshelves.  Now he has no love for grammar <br/>\nand composition,  but he has watched his sister prepare for and go to <br/>\ncollege and we have had many discussions on college entrance and ACTs <br/>\nbecause this is something he sees in his future.  So,  I do feel like <br/>\nwe are guiding him.   More than anything though,  I see myself as a <br/>\nfacilitator.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2577,"nextTopicId":2629}}
