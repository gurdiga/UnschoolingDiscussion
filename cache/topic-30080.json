For those who are to<br/>\n&gt; small minded not to see Santa Clause as he is, you deserve not to believe.<br/>\n&gt; Belief in Santa is a right that all children, of any age, have. How dare<br/>\n&gt; any of you try to tell me that there is no Santa. I&#39;m 32 years old and<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; known Santa since I was 6 months old. I was one of those lucky children to<br/>\n&gt; have his picture in the paper sitting on Santa&#39;s lap. I defended him<br/>\n&gt; throughout my junior/senior high school years when my other friends fell<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; the wayside. And yes, he still visits my house every December. Santa<br/>\n&gt; Clause is more than a man in a red suit. He is the spirit of Christmas. He<br/>\n&gt; is giving to children everywhere, without ever asking anything in return.<br/>\n&gt; He is joy. He is charity. He is love. He is Christmas!!!! Those of you<br/>\n&gt; who deny his existence, deny Christmas exists as anything other than any<br/>\n&gt; other day. You deny that Christmas is special and unique. If you feel that<br/>\n&gt; way about Christmas, you have my pity.

Because Santa&#39;s<br/>\n  coming, you know. If you&#39;re good, he&#39;s going to bring you lots of toys.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I refuse to give anybody this power over him - or let them give us (his<br/>\n  parents) this power. When people ask whether he&#39;s a &quot;good boy&quot; (in Christmas<br/>\n  season or out), I say, &quot;Yes, he&#39;s good. All children are good. There are no<br/>\n  bad children.&quot; This usually throws &#39;em for a loop.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s even worse in Spain, where I lived for nine years, only there it&#39;s, &quot;If<br/>\n  you&#39;re good, los Reyes (the Kings, sort of what we know as the Three Wise<br/>\n  Men) will bring you gifts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I want our son to know it&#39;s us who buy him gifts, from the start. He can<br/>\n  believe in Santa the same way he believes he is a fireman battling a fire<br/>\n  when he puts a toy helmet on his head and waves around a toy snake. I don&#39;t<br/>\n  think that ruins the magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve always wondered what people think little kids in families where the<br/>\n  parents can&#39;t afford toys or are too drunk to remember it&#39;s Christmas must<br/>\n  think, when they don&#39;t get any toys. These kids must suspect they&#39;ve been<br/>\n  bad, right? What do the good kids in the middle class families think of the<br/>\n  poor kids who get fewer toys than they do? What do the ones who get toys<br/>\n  think of the Jewish, Muslim, etc., kids who don&#39;t get a visit from Santa?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why do people believe kids have to be bribed into being good? Is that really<br/>\n  being good, anyway? Isn&#39;t it being a kind of mercenary?<br/>\n<br/>\n  On a related note, it eats me up inside to hear people sending their kids<br/>\n  off to school, or leaving them at the babysitter&#39;s, with the good old<br/>\n  all-purpose admonition, &quot;Be good, now.&quot; It&#39;s kind of a useless thing to say,<br/>\n  isn&#39;t it?

Some of my little friends say there is no <br/>\n  Santa Claus. Papa says, &quot;If you see it in The Sun, it&#39;s so.&quot; Please <br/>\n  tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?<br/>\n<br/>\n       Virginia O&#39;Hanlon<br/>\n<br/>\n  Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by <br/>\n  the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they <br/>\n  see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by <br/>\n  their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men&#39;s or <br/>\n  children&#39;s, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere <br/>\n  insect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world <br/>\n  about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the <br/>\n  whole of truth and knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love <br/>\n  and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and <br/>\n  give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would <br/>\n  be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as <br/>\n  if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, <br/>\n  no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should <br/>\n  have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with <br/>\n  which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. <br/>\n  You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on <br/>\n  Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa <br/>\n  Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, <br/>\n  but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real <br/>\n  things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. <br/>\n  Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but <br/>\n  that&#39;s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or <br/>\n  imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You tear apart the baby&#39;s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, <br/>\n  but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest <br/>\n  man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever <br/>\n  lived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push <br/>\n  aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory <br/>\n  beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is <br/>\n  nothing else real and abiding.<br/>\n<br/>\n  No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives and lives forever. A thousand <br/>\n  years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will <br/>\n  continue to make glad the heart of childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!

When people ask whether he&#39;s a &quot;good boy&quot; (in Christmas<br/>\nseason or out), I say, &quot;Yes, he&#39;s good. All children are good. There are no<br/>\nbad children.&quot; This usually throws &#39;em for a loop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s even worse in Spain, where I lived for nine years, only there it&#39;s, &quot;If<br/>\nyou&#39;re good, los Reyes (the Kings, sort of what we know as the Three Wise<br/>\nMen) will bring you gifts.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI want our son to know it&#39;s us who buy him gifts, from the start.

These kids must suspect they&#39;ve been<br/>\nbad, right? What do the good kids in the middle class families think of the<br/>\npoor kids who get fewer toys than they do? What do the ones who get toys<br/>\nthink of the Jewish, Muslim, etc., kids who don&#39;t get a visit from Santa?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do people believe kids have to be bribed into being good? Is that really<br/>\nbeing good, anyway? Isn&#39;t it being a kind of mercenary?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, it eats me up inside to hear people sending their kids<br/>\noff to school, or leaving them at the babysitter&#39;s, with the good old<br/>\nall-purpose admonition, &quot;Be good, now.&quot; It&#39;s kind of a useless thing to say,<br/>\nisn&#39;t it?

Some of my little friends say there is no <br/>\nSanta Claus. Papa says, &quot;If you see it in The Sun, it&#39;s so.&quot; Please <br/>\ntell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?<br/>\n<br/>\n     Virginia O&#39;Hanlon<br/>\n<br/>\nVirginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by <br/>\nthe skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they <br/>\nsee. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by <br/>\ntheir little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men&#39;s or <br/>\nchildren&#39;s, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere <br/>\ninsect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world <br/>\nabout him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the <br/>\nwhole of truth and knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love <br/>\nand generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and <br/>\ngive to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would <br/>\nbe the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as <br/>\nif there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, <br/>\nno poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should <br/>\nhave no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with <br/>\nwhich childhood fills the world would be extinguished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. <br/>\nYou might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on <br/>\nChristmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa <br/>\nClaus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, <br/>\nbut that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real <br/>\nthings in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. <br/>\nDid you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or <br/>\nimagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou tear apart the baby&#39;s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, <br/>\nbut there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest <br/>\nman, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever <br/>\nlived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push <br/>\naside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory <br/>\nbeyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is <br/>\nnothing else real and abiding.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives and lives forever. A thousand <br/>\nyears from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will <br/>\ncontinue to make glad the heart of childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Santa and unschooling","postDate":"1008649554","msgId":30081,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUxNkdZT2YtMDAwN0RHLTAwQGhhd2sucHJvZC5pdGQuZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":30080,"nextInTopic":30082,"prevInTime":30080,"nextInTime":30082,"topicId":30080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
