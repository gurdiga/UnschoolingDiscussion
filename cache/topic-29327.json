The reaction from the poor lady was what was so interesting - <br/>\nshe started detailing why she *had* to put her kids in school <br/>\n(because she needed to take a job), how much they were enjoying the <br/>\nalternative school, but *of course* it would never be as wonderful as <br/>\nhomeschooling had been, etc., etc., etc. By the time she wound down <br/>\nand my friend changed the subject I was beginning to wonder if I&#39;d <br/>\nunconsciously frowned at the word &#39;school&#39; or something to invoke <br/>\nsuch a defensive reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot the first time this has happened, of course.
