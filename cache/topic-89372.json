I am a Christian who &quot;got saved&quot; <br/>\nalmost 20 years ago at(how perfect is this) a Billy Graham Crusade. I <br/>\nwas a practicing and devout protestant (although very different with <br/>\nmy unschooling, nurse your kid til he&#39;s 5 type views) up until a year <br/>\nand half ago when I started to unschool myself right into the <br/>\nCatholic church. Cardinal John Henry Newman once said, &quot;To be deep in <br/>\nhistory is to cease to be protestant&quot;.  He was a protestant <br/>\nconvert to the Catholic church. Anyway, I digress, as a protestant, <br/>\nin many churches, I was taught that the Catholic church was <br/>\nthe &quot;whore <br/>\nof Babylon&quot;.  Even the famous Left Behind Series has the anti-Christs <br/>\nbest pal some former Papal dude.  Anyway, there is WAY WAY more <br/>\nprejudice from the Baptists (and other protestant groups) AGAINST the <br/>\nCatholics than the other way around.  At Mass we pray for ALL <br/>\nChristians whether or not they are Catholic, that we may someday be <br/>\nunified as Christ wanted us to &quot;be one as my Father and I are one&quot;.<br/>\nI lived that prejudice of which I speak. Worrying about my Catholic <br/>\nfriends when I was <br/>\nprotestant.  I have been a Catholic for a while now, and I am not <br/>\ncoming up against &quot;Baptists (protestants) are the vehicles of Satan&quot; <br/>\nat church at ALL.  However, evangelical and fundamentalist friends <br/>\nthink I have joined the greatest cult of them all and have been duped <br/>\nby Satan. Oh well. But protestants are taught not to ever investigate <br/>\nCatholicism. If they did, many would be surprised.  I used to think <br/>\nthat people left the Catholic church for protestant churches or <br/>\nnothing at all. Imagine my surprise when almost everyone I have met <br/>\nhas been an adult convert, from protestantism to catholicism.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel --Happy to believe what I believe and happy that you all <br/>\nbelieve what you believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

I am a Christian who &quot;got saved&quot; <br/>\nalmost 20 years ago at(how perfect is this) a Billy Graham Crusade. I <br/>\nwas a practicing and devout protestant (although very different with <br/>\nmy unschooling, nurse your kid til he&#39;s 5 type views) up until a year <br/>\nand half ago when I started to unschool myself right into the <br/>\nCatholic church. Cardinal John Henry Newman once said, &quot;To be deep in <br/>\nhistory is to cease to be protestant&quot;.  He was a protestant <br/>\nconvert to the Catholic church. Anyway, I digress, as a protestant, <br/>\nin many churches, I was taught that the Catholic church was <br/>\nthe &quot;whore <br/>\nof Babylon&quot;.  Even the famous Left Behind Series has the anti-Christs <br/>\nbest pal some former Papal dude.  Anyway, there is WAY WAY more <br/>\nprejudice from the Baptists (and other protestant groups) AGAINST the <br/>\nCatholics than the other way around.  At Mass we pray for ALL <br/>\nChristians whether or not they are Catholic, that we may someday be <br/>\nunified as Christ wanted us to &quot;be one as my Father and I are one&quot;.<br/>\nI lived that prejudice of which I speak. Worrying about my Catholic <br/>\nfriends when I was <br/>\nprotestant.  I have been a Catholic for a while now, and I am not <br/>\ncoming up against &quot;Baptists (protestants) are the vehicles of Satan&quot; <br/>\nat church at ALL.  However, evangelical and fundamentalist friends <br/>\nthink I have joined the greatest cult of them all and have been duped <br/>\nby Satan. Oh well. But protestants are taught not to ever investigate <br/>\nCatholicism. If they did, many would be surprised.  I used to think <br/>\nthat people left the Catholic church for protestant churches or <br/>\nnothing at all.
