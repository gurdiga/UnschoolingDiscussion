So I have learned over the past 6 months since we <br/>\nhave been unschooling to go in gently around noon and just lay down <br/>\nnext to her.  We cuddle, talk and giggle.  She wakes up in such a <br/>\ngreat mood and the tone for the day is much more pleasant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWishing your son a quick recovery.  Also, Sandra, I love your website -<br/>\n I&#39;m on it all the time.  The information there is wonderful and very <br/>\ninformative during our transition from schoolish life(chaos) to <br/>\nunschooling (peace.  Also, THANK YOU to all of you on this discussion <br/>\nfor your great input.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108801,"nextTopicId":108755}}
