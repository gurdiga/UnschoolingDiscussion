I have GameBoys for my children, and they&#39;re only allowed <br/>\nto use them when we&#39;re in the car.  We have Monopoly, Chessmaster, <br/>\nElmo&#39;s ABCs and Elmo&#39;s 123 for the more educational games, but there <br/>\nare a lot of interesting strategy games out there as well.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nallow anything with violence, so the other games they have are Super <br/>\nBreakout (which is like the old Pong), Mickey&#39;s Racing Game (Mickey <br/>\nand friends race through Walt Disney World), Wild Thornberries (I <br/>\nlove their homeschooling, traveling, animal adventures, although I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to see them leave Debbie and her bad attitude at home), Matchbox <br/>\nConstruction Zone, Pokemon PacMan (I hate Pokemon, but it&#39;s just a <br/>\ndifferent version of PacMan), and Super Mario Brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also get previously owned games at www.half.com and other <br/>\nwebsites, which make them even cheaper!
