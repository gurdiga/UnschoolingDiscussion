I used to write a lot of fiction.  So even now, for a special occasion, I will pull out the decaying pouch in which I have some of my writing and read a story to the children.  They really love it because it is something daddy wrote.  I believe it encouraged them to start writing when they were younger and they have just kept at it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that helps us I think, is that the whole family stops what we are doing as soon as someone has written something they wish to share.  Then we all give positive reinforcement regardless of the content or actual entertainment value.  But, normally, the things they write really are quite interesting and good; also very revealing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater then, one of us will go back over the writing and check grammar, spelling, etc., and add that to our list of things to work on, using their own material as the first hand reference.  Their writing and language skills just continues to improve this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYCCOM - RJS<br/>\nICQ: 6461385<br/>\nhttp://www/onelist.com/subscribe/LearningWhileLiving<br/>\nhttp://www.rjsinternational.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Helen Martiniuk","from":"Helen Martiniuk &lt;plumplus@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"7amn3v1kMH-1LntddvwTvZy5UQXYI7pcnxjcsL-tr0ZH2XTBEI9OQ8WC5baaSLfA8OlxVwwzwTPlFH31KJmVysnzC2GlmIw7oDuQzA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: To All /highschool diploma?","postDate":"940893652","msgId":4051,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNjguNDA1MS45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4054,"prevInTime":4050,"nextInTime":4052,"topicId":4051,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"To All: Thank-you to everyone who took the time to share their ideas with me.

I think we&#39;ve talked about how resistant some of our children <br/>\nare to writing ANYTHING - especially boys it seems.  My 13 year old <br/>\nwill do almost anything to avoid writing.  The computer does help <br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t like the physical act of writing,  but it still <br/>\nisn&#39;t something he chooses to do.  He can write rather well though,  <br/>\nso I&#39;m not too concerned.
