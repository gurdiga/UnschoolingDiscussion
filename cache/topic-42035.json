What I found encouraging about Helen&#39;s discussion with <br/>\nher son is that it reminded me of discussions we have here, though my kids <br/>\nare 12 and 8 and things can&#39;t get all that deep or graphic. But we have <br/>\ntouched lightly on pornography, and the fact that it is exploitation of <br/>\nmostly women by billion dollar corporations run and fueled mostly by men. My <br/>\nkids know that many of the women in it were sexually abused when they were <br/>\nyounger, and truly can&#39;t be happy being involved with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI listen to (but don&#39;t enjoy) all the music they listen to. They buy their <br/>\nown as well. The same goes for DVD&#39;s and videos and books.<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42024,"nextTopicId":42036}}
