The larvae inters the <br/>\ndogs bloodstream and infects the heart and lungs. It is common throughout all <br/>\nthe US, and there are some areas where it is extremely prevalent. Left <br/>\nuntreated, Heartwrom will clog the heart and lungs of a dog. Heartworm is <br/>\nbest treated by prevention as it is very hard to treat after infestation. <br/>\nSymptoms include weight loss, and coughing. Heartworms can grow up to 12 or <br/>\nmore inches in length, and a dog or cat heart infested with the worms looks <br/>\nrather nasty. <br/>\nBecause I was a nurse, I am kind of on the fence when it comes to <br/>\nvaccinations (kids and pets) But, because heartworm is so prevalent here, we <br/>\ngive Maggie a monthly pill. We also get her parvo vaccination because we have <br/>\nparvo in our ground. There are some sites with explanations of heartworm, and <br/>\nI looked for one with pictures of the worm infestation, but couldn&#39;t find <br/>\none. (I didn&#39;t look long though) Our vet has a dog heart in a jar that has <br/>\nthe infestation and it is really nasty. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"&quot;Shyrley&quot; &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] help with 2 yr old, what dogs eat, what we believe","postDate":"1033401180","msgId":44868,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTMwMTU1MjAyLlhOVlkyMjMxNi5vdXQwMTMudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRAbWFya3Njb21wdXRlcj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRlLjJkZDNhOTAzLjJhYzljNGFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44866,"nextInTopic":44872,"prevInTime":44867,"nextInTime":44869,"topicId":44817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I even have doggie *recipies* I <br/>\nhave invented for her. For example, I made a roast with carrots, potatoes, <br/>\nand onions in the crock pot yesterday. I saved the middles from the onions, <br/>\n(I don&#39;t use them because the core is bitter) all the carrot ends, the fat <br/>\nthat had to be trimmed off the meat, a little meat, potato peals, and one <br/>\nsmall potato. After the crock pot was loaded, I put my scraps into a pot on <br/>\nthe stove added some water and cooked the scraps for Maggie Stew. I cook it <br/>\nuntil it is basically a mush and add some to her food and freeze the rest in <br/>\nold bread bags that I twist off (looks like a row of plastic sausage links). <br/>\nWhenever I want to treat her, I cut off one section of the bag, thaw it out <br/>\nin the microwave and mix into her food. I also put her heart worm pill in <br/>\nwith the treat when I put it in her food.<br/>\nNow I realize this is the extreme of dog ownership, and many won&#39;t go that <br/>\nfar for treats, its easier to buy a doggie treat at the store, but for me it <br/>\nis cheaper to do it this way. Maggie sits in the kitchen when I am cooking <br/>\nand I tell her I am making her treats. She talks to me with small barks, <br/>\nmoans, growls and wiggles all over. She gets so excited when I cook, she gets <br/>\nto talking to me, and wiggling so much, she slips around on the kitchen <br/>\nfloor. She loves the smells of all the food. Sometimes she will sit on Moly&#39;s <br/>\nstool and stick her nose up in the air, she is perfectly still, closes her <br/>\neyes and she just sighs. I am positive she knows I am cooking for her. She is <br/>\nhardly fat, she weighs about 13 lbs. Last year she got up to 18 lbs. but she <br/>\nwas pregnant. I save just about everything and make up all sorts of treats <br/>\nfor her. I freeze most in the sausage link/bread bag thing. She gets so much <br/>\npleasure from the smells, and like I said, she knows I am making something <br/>\nfor her, I would hate to take that away from her. I agree with Sandra, I <br/>\nwould rather have a fat happy dog than waste even the fat, potato peals and <br/>\ncarrot ends. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] help with 2 yr old, what dogs eat, what we  believe","postDate":"1033353395","msgId":44839,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEOTdCOEIyLjZBMzNCNUVEQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDE5NS5lMGE3NDc3LjJhYzhlZjlhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44833,"nextInTopic":44843,"prevInTime":44838,"nextInTime":44840,"topicId":44817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** I d rather have a fat happy dog than to throw meat scraps (or cheese or anything a dog would like to eat) away right in front of a dog.** At one point,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2144373932\">**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d rather have a fat happy dog than to throw meat scraps (or cheese or <br/>\nanything a dog would like to eat) away right in front of a dog.**<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, earlier, I think we were talking about pop tarts.

I feel bad <br/>\nsterilizing pets, but I do it.  I don&#39;t like it.  So I try not to control <br/>\nevery tiny bit of the rest of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when people are compassionate it&#39;s about making them better people, <br/>\non a mental and spiritual level, and not even so directly about the effect it <br/>\nhas on others around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see a chasm between the way a person treats a child and the way a <br/>\nperson treats a dog.  It&#39;s the treater, not the treatee, sometimes we see.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur neighbors are really mean to their dogs.  Two spaniels who are yelled at <br/>\nfor barking when someone comes to the door, and one shepherd puppy (nearly a <br/>\nyear old now) who is similarly yelled at if he barks or jumps up on the wall <br/>\nwhen we go out into our yard.  We&#39;d be glad to talk to him and pet him but <br/>\nhe&#39;s insulted and berated just for coming to look at us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir kids are all grown, and I don&#39;t know them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other side, they had a shepherd puppy who got LOTS of attention when <br/>\nhe was little, and was chained up untrained when he was older.  I would have <br/>\nloved to liberate him, but they would have noticed if he lived next door, I <br/>\nguess.   When he was about a year old they gave him away to someone.  I was <br/>\nglad, but sad that most of his first year had been lacking in attention and <br/>\nlove.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure they tell their children they can&#39;t have another dog because they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t take care of that one, but the kids are little, and the parents are <br/>\nirresponsible.  So the kids get the blame for what the parents didn&#39;t do.  <br/>\nNot just about the dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes solutions to problems require changing what we believe.  Sometimes <br/>\nwhat we believe isn&#39;t very well founded and changing is a relief!  That&#39;s <br/>\nhappened with me lots over my life.  I will claim to &quot;believe&quot; something but <br/>\nwhen I really look at it it&#39;s not &quot;belief&quot; in the way beliefs should be, but <br/>\nparotting, or accepting the facade of what I&#39;d heard and seen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be that way about school.  Either my own investment or training or <br/>\nhopes had made school the great hope of the future.   Other people&#39;s points <br/>\nmade way more sense than my &quot;beliefs.&quot;  I didn&#39;t even need  new evidence, I <br/>\njust needed to squint, kinda, and look at the same old thing a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many people today believe formula is cleaner and more scientific than <br/>\nbreast milk?  Why would they believe that?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] help with 2 yr old, what dogs eat, what we believe","postDate":"1033345283","msgId":44831,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTEwMWMyNjgxYSQzMzlkOTk0MCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTI5LjE2MjAyNi4xODkyLjIuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44830,"nextInTopic":44833,"prevInTime":44830,"nextInTime":44832,"topicId":44817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Eeeewwwww!!!!

Would you? I&#39;ve had way too many dogs that <br/>\nthis has been proven with. Does it make them sick, yes sometimes and then <br/>\nthe consequences are gross for us and upsetting to the dog. Will it kill <br/>\nthem, no. Is there a reason why they need it, no. Will it fatten them up, <br/>\nmost of the time yes. Are there exceptions to the rule, of course. Is it <br/>\neasier for me to feed only dog food and biscuits, not have a fat dog or one <br/>\nthat has an upset stomach and not worry about whether I have to cook for him <br/>\nor not to get him to eat? Most definitely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people do the whole food diets with their dogs and do the raw meat and <br/>\nveggies and all. Great for them. I don&#39;t have time for it, and honestly <br/>\ndon&#39;t see the need for it. My dogs are part of our family but they are not <br/>\nmy kids.
