Why?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, I missed the EASY questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are state laws, so it totally depends where you move.  Do you know <br/>\nwhere you&#39;ll be?<br/>\n<br/>\nAmericans as a class of people do NOT habitually carry guns around, nor hunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some people who hunt a couple of three times a year and that&#39;s <br/>\nconsidered &quot;being a hunter,&quot; because many hunts are by lottery and only some <br/>\ncertain number get to go, and a hunting license will only allow for one deer <br/>\nper season.  Even hunting once in two or three years can be &quot;being a hunter&quot; <br/>\nbut for someone who&#39;s only been a time or two, that&#39;s &quot;I&#39;ve hunted.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo &quot;being&quot; is pretty sparse activity anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends in Wyoming (a husband and wife, 50ish) who hunt LOTS, with bow <br/>\nfor sport and with guns for food.  Every year they put on a feast and invite <br/>\ntheir friends. My husband has been.  They&#39;re also cooks.  So they kill and <br/>\ncook it themselves.  I have friends here in Albuquerque who hunt at least <br/>\nonce a year, and for them it&#39;s a guys-out weekend.  (My parents used to go <br/>\ntogether, mostly, like the Wyoming couple.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople do initial cleaning out where they&#39;re hunting.  The animal is gutted.  <br/>\nThere are certain things that have to be removed immediately so the meat <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t go bad.  Someone else will have to tell that.  The liver is sometimes <br/>\ncooked right then and there.  If it&#39;s someone&#39;s first kill, there are <br/>\ntraditions concerning blood and liver which will never affect me personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, generally, the animal is taken to a butcher, packaged up and picked up <br/>\nall marked in white paper packages.  Sometimes the butcher works in exchange <br/>\nfor a portion of the meat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to carrying guns or locking them up, it depends on the person and the <br/>\nstate.  Some states don&#39;t allow guns to be tranported except in certain <br/>\ncircumstances (locked in the trunk of a car AND in the presence of a hunting <br/>\nlicense or membership card for a shooting club--that kind of combination).  <br/>\nSome allow them, but not concealed.  So they need to be in a gun rack or in a <br/>\nholster case visible to police if they pull you over (there are mountings for <br/>\nholsters on the dashes or pickup trucks, and this is often pickup truck <br/>\nrelated---my dad had a gun rack in the back window of his truck, always).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people keep a gun locked in the glove compartment, or in the compartment <br/>\nunder the passenger seat in a minivan.  In some states that&#39;s what you HAVE <br/>\nto do to have one.  In other states, that&#39;s what you CAN&#39;T do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn New Mexico people can carry guns, but not into hospitals, bars, or polling <br/>\nplaces.  So they need to lock them in the truck in such cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who&#39;s a city cop here and when visiting a house in which the <br/>\npeople don&#39;t know him, in Colorado, he made a speech just inside the door <br/>\nwhich was, &quot;Ma&#39;am, I have a handgun on my person.  If this makes you <br/>\nuncomfortable, I&#39;ll lock it in the car&quot; or something very similar.  She was <br/>\nreally impressed with him.  He&#39;s an Eagle Scout, totally sweet guy. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the 1940&#39;s and 50&#39;s it was common (out here) for kids to go out and shoot <br/>\nnon-food animals.  Squirrels, snakes, birds, rabbits.  Some families didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike it and would say &quot;If you kill it, you have to eat it.&quot;  Some families <br/>\nconsidered it useful in that it desensitized the kids to killing animals <br/>\n(when the parents were from a ranching/farming tradition in which kids cannot <br/>\nbe considering cows and chickens and pigs as &quot;cute&quot; or pets), and because it <br/>\ntaught them to use guns so they could be hunters or marksmen.  Many of those <br/>\ndads had just returned from WWII and were afraid of further danger and really <br/>\ndid want their kids to be prepared to defend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn an urban situation, that mentality is different than it is when a family <br/>\nlives in a house on 20 or 2,000 or 200,000 acres of land and that land isn&#39;t <br/>\nshared with others.   The mentality of people in the western states, who are <br/>\nranchers in the Rocky Mountains, or who live in the desert with rattle snakes <br/>\nis TOTALLY different from Boston, or New York, places where it is crowded now <br/>\nand has been crowded for hundreds of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16265,"nextTopicId":16250}}
