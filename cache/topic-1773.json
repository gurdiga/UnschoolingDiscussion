Yippee!). She is considered<br/>\nan &quot;occasional driver.&quot; Since we are going to be unschooling beginning<br/>\nthis fall (she&#39;s been in public school prior to this), I wondered how<br/>\nour car insurer would handle the &quot;Good Student Discount&quot; for a<br/>\nhomeschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called USAA and they said they are happy to provide &quot;Good Student<br/>\nDiscounts&quot; to homeschooled children. All I need to do is fill out the<br/>\nnormal required form and mail it in. They said that after the &quot;school<br/>\nyear,&quot; they &quot;may&quot; ask for grades. I said that would be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to look at your automobile insurance policy and inquire<br/>\nas to the same. I appreciate those companies who recognize homeschoolers<br/>\nas being eligible for a &quot;Good Student Discount.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise<br/>\nBerkeley County, South Carolina<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. There is also a &quot;Driver&#39;s Education&quot; discount available on our<br/>\npolicy. I wonder if they would allow that discount should her dad or I<br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; her driver&#39;s ed. I&#39;ll have to check that out.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1723,"nextTopicId":1676}}
