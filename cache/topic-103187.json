Are you or your husband like that <br/>\ntoo?  My kids, especially my middle child Matt, don&#39;t particularly <br/>\nlike to go out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I worry, I remember that my husband is exactly the same <br/>\nway.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy vacations, he doesn&#39;t enjoy going out to eat <br/>\nvery often, he certainly doesn&#39;t enjoy museums or historical sites, <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t enjoy crowds of people or meeting new people.  Last year <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t go anywhere on vacation and he was THRILLED.  I mentioned <br/>\nto him that it would be nice to slowly put money aside for something <br/>\nlike Disney World, and he said that instead of spending money on a <br/>\ntrip he&#39;d rather spend money on making his home more like a vacation <br/>\nresort.  His philosophy is that he has everything he needs right <br/>\nhere, so why should he want to leave.  My kids feel the same way.  <br/>\nI do not.  I love my home, I love my family, we have lots of fun <br/>\ntogether at home.

My son Matt doesn&#39;t even want to go trick or <br/>\ntreating next year because &quot;the candy smells like the person&#39;s house <br/>\nthat it came from&quot;.

See how enjoyable it is to choose to spend the day <br/>\nconnecting to your kids. Delight in choosing to find things to strew <br/>\nthat will spark their curiousity. If there&#39;s a repeated &quot;problem&quot; <br/>\nwith food or sleep, think about what help you can offer. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were having a little power struggle for a few days here: ds <br/>\nstarted making lots of noise while dd was trying to go down for a <br/>\nnap. I could not control what he was doing while she was nursing, so <br/>\nI had no choice but to find a different way of dealing with it. In <br/>\nthe morning, I set aside some candy and a couple special art supplies <br/>\non a counter that the kids can&#39;t see. When dd started to go to sleep <br/>\nI sent ds to climb up and found the suprises I&#39;d left for him. He was <br/>\nso pleased! And then next day he happily turned the volume down on <br/>\nthe game he was playing and stopped yelling back at it. I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ncontroling him, but my actions are what turned the situation around. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t feel helpless that I couldn&#39;t control him, I felt powerful <br/>\nthat I could change my actions and that that led to a change in the <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not recommending &quot;feeling powerful&quot; as a goal for unschooling <br/>\nparents, just talking about taking a step away from controling kids <br/>\ntoward radical unschooling. I was not in a radical <br/>\nunschooling/mindful parenting frame of mind when he was making noise, <br/>\nI was in a tired, grumpy, thinking punishment was called for kind of <br/>\nmood. So focusing on myself and my actions were the first step. After <br/>\nthat, I started thinking about our afternoons and how they&#39;ve changed <br/>\nover the last month, what ds needs and wasn&#39;t getting, and we&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked about it together.<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Fetteroll <br/>\n&lt;fetteroll@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The philosophical idea people would like to get across is becoming <br/>\n </span></blockquote>your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; child&#39;s partner.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But maybe part of the problem in trying to explain it is that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>parents who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; control already think they are being, if not a partner, at least <br/>\n </span></blockquote>being<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; helpful.

Darn!  Marty took it,  and <br/>\ntried to get the clifftop in (and did), but then missed the length of hill  below <br/>\nCameron, and the little arroyo between him and that hill.  That was  taken <br/>\nfacing north from the trail into Echo Amphitheatre near Ghost Ranch, north  of <br/>\nAbiquiu.  Cameron took his drum to play there, and is playing it in the  photo. <br/>\nIt sounded great, up near the amphitheatre itself.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was looking for online photos of that site, since we ran out of film, but  <br/>\nam afraid I&#39;ll lose this e-mail if I don&#39;t stop screwing around with too many  <br/>\nwindows open.
