That brings my total<br/>\nnursing years to 10 so far &lt;sheepish grin&gt; In all these years of nursing I<br/>\ncan remember only a few times when I noticed someone become uncomfortable.<br/>\nMost of those instances were when I had a very young infant and someone was<br/>\njust *waiting* for the baby to want to nurse.  They knew it would happen and<br/>\nwere anticipating what should be their response.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that disgust and phrases like &quot;whip it out&quot; are often thinly<br/>\nveiled hostility and while I&#39;m not all that interested in accomodating<br/>\npeople who would speak to me that way, I certainly don&#39;t want my children to<br/>\nbe exposed to this type of hostile response and I also recognize there  are<br/>\nsome people who are (sadly) genuinely uncomfortable with the thought of<br/>\nbresastfeeding in general.  These might not say anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned in LLL that lifting a shirt from the bottom is more discrete than<br/>\nbuttoning down from the top but you&#39;d be surprised how many new moms simply<br/>\ndon&#39;t think of this at first.  It is obvious if you live in a cold climate<br/>\nbut not here in SoCal.(Also, it&#39;s easy to make your own nursing shirt by<br/>\nlayering two light weight shirts of the same color.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that it&#39;s much quicker and more dicrete than a big blanket over the<br/>\nshoulder.  Some other ideas to try:  A sun hat, hankerchief, even a book or<br/>\nnewspaper to screen the &quot;contact point&quot; where you might becomeexposed. If<br/>\nyou do use a blanket it&#39;s better just over baby and a bit to cover his face<br/>\nthan over both of you whichjust screams&quot;look over here!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 3yo likes to nurse standing up while I sit in a chair.  I have had entire<br/>\nconversations with people who had no idea that she was nursing bc I obscured<br/>\nthe view with a jacket or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, with my friends and family, I make no special effort to hide our<br/>\nbreast feeding but occasionally, i know there are people with whom I&#39;d<br/>\nrather not discuss it.  Discretion gives me more power to choose when and<br/>\nwith whom I wish to talk about these parenting issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time in each of my three kids nursing relationship that they<br/>\nwanted mor of me - more exposure, posession of &quot;the other side&quot; or lifting,<br/>\nunbuttoning etc.  With each child, all that was neccesary was consistent,<br/>\nkind, explanation that &quot;mommy wants to be covered up.&quot;  It may take a few<br/>\nweeks but by the time they&#39;re doing these things they were usually old<br/>\nenough to understand this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you got this far you&#39;re likely a nursing mom yourself.  Thanks for<br/>\nputting up with my long ramblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nsincerely<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80659,"nextTopicId":79941}}
