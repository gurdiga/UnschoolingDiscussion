Why do you not want to buy something for your<br/>\ndd?  In our home, a lot of what the kids would like, we simply can&#39;t afford<br/>\n(we have 5 kids and one income).  Is there a way the kid can earn money to<br/>\nget it themselves?  Or pay for half?  Is it that you simply think the item<br/>\nis not a good purchase, somehow against your values?  Again, can the kid pay<br/>\nfor it?  How about a discussion of values and see if the kid really wants<br/>\nthe item?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the party goes.....are you concerned your dd would not be safe in<br/>\nthe company of her sisters?  If so, then little sis gets to whine in my<br/>\nopinion.  I might suggest alternate activities but.....    Is it that the<br/>\nbig sisters don&#39;t really want little sis to go, just don&#39;t want to be<br/>\n&quot;mean?&quot;  I would talk with big sisters about how they are putting you on a<br/>\nspot.  If sisters don&#39;t mind her going and you think she would be safe with<br/>\nthem, then I&#39;m with little sis....why can&#39;t she go?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"RValvo7626@aol.com","from":"RValvo7626@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kjUERVbDFC5Siasp7CD2pdBj1rMf5omQgYuDlDVdSQ6eN0_x9BgXSgh2tMCD3ahCpEKd1zfarQXl","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1417","postDate":"999880553","msgId":24365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNi41NDI3MWIzLjI4Y2E1MTY5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24377,"prevInTime":24364,"nextInTime":24366,"topicId":24365,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/7/01 8:13:47 AM Mountain Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-586390068\">In a message dated 9/7/01 8:13:47 AM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; How about a bar of soap at the creek?<br/>\n We used to take a bath in the lake in WI.
