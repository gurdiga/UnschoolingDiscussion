They were<br/>\nwritten for the express purpose of being performed.  The script is only the<br/>\nroad map of the production.  Reading a script is like looking at a road map<br/>\nof someone&#39;s trip to the most beautiful place on earth and trying to get a<br/>\nsense of it from only that 2 dimensional piece of paper.  Don&#39;t torture<br/>\nyourself trying to read plays, there it too much other good stuff out there!<br/>\nMy husband and I also do theatre and when I am getting ready to design the<br/>\ncostumes for a play I always go to the first read through.  Even though it<br/>\nis just the actors and director sitting around a table reading the script<br/>\naloud, it *always* clarifies the story for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSave a particular play for when you can find an affordable production of it<br/>\nlive, or rent it on video tape or find a book on tape version.  Or if you<br/>\njust can&#39;t wait, get a group of friends together and do your own read<br/>\nthrough!<br/>\n<br/>\nJocelyn Vilter<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: 28 Aug 2002 05:24:36 -0000<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2300<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find a LOT of plays boring to read - and we are theater people! I<br/>\n&gt; really <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t understand a play until I&#39;ve seen it on it&#39;s feet, then read it,<br/>\n&gt; then <br/>\n&gt; seen it or worked on it some more.**<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hey, Paula --<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think my son is too young, and my budget too lean for live theater.<br/>\n&gt; But I&#39;ve been wanting to get more plays on video.  My son has watched<br/>\n&gt; some Shakespeare and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead with avid<br/>\n&gt; interest.  I&#39;m thinking he can handle some pretty complicated ideas if<br/>\n&gt; he gets to take them in on the comfort of his couch.  Do you want to<br/>\n&gt; recommend anything?  (The rest of you are welcome to chime in.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think I&#39;m getting my husband Steambath on video for Christmas.<br/>\n&gt; Irreverance really appeals to him.  (Definitely explains why he married me.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Betsy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42321,"nextTopicId":42347}}
