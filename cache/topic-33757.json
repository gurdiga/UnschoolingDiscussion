I give them <br/>\nminimal information unless they want more. There&#39;s no reason to speak <br/>\nof myself, it quetions their beliefs and sometimes they become <br/>\nagressive. The ones that are interested will come and ask more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when the person or people I have these discussions <br/>\nwith start talking about how they identify... and yes.. they think <br/>\nlearning should be made to be fun... (I just smile as I watch the <br/>\nconcept fly over their heads and hope that some of lands enough to <br/>\neventually pursue)<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody has to MAKE learning fun. Nobody needs to SELL it. Or even to <br/>\nfind books or videos or games that have some hidden agenda of <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of sugar-coating something reminds me that something <br/>\nneeds sugar-coating. Like a painkiller of sorts.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning IS fun when one is interested in the subject. It&#39;s a natural <br/>\npart of one&#39;s life when they are not damaged by the philosophy of <br/>\nsugar-coating.<br/>\n<br/>\nk</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33733,"nextTopicId":33764}}
