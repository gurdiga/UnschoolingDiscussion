They were like &quot;ok&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was likely very confusing for them, all of a sudden changing the game about going to sleep.  I think the unschooling idea of &quot;no bedtimes&quot; means getting rid of the idea of an arbitrary time to go to bed just because of what time it is on the clock.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means helping them learn to listen to their bodies about when they are tired and helping them decide what to do about it (quiet activity? nap? bedtime?).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt means helping them figure out how they best like to get to sleep.  Maybe it is playing with them until they happily drop asleep and then carrying them to bed.  Maybe it is finding out an opportune time to suggest getting ready for bed and launching into a comforting routine to help them settle into sleep (and not forcing the issue).  Maybe it&#39;s them coming to you saying they are ready to start their routine.  As the get older, maybe it&#39;s leaving them to play quietly while you are sleeping and crawling into bed when they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat &quot;no bedtime&quot; looks like in each unschooling house it going to be different.  It&#39;s even likely to look different for each kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think bedtime works for us. It can range between 8-10pm but we need the routine.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t consider that an arbitrary bedtime, I would consider that a routine for going to sleep.  You notice somewhere between 8 and 10pm that they seem to be getting tired, that the activity they are doing is coming to a close, and that now is a good time to start getting ready for bed. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Emme needs the routine.  She was a mess without it.  She was even crying. I found her just sitting on the couch crying.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s sad.  Any child who loves routines (labeled or not) will really enjoy a routine to help them settle into sleep.  It sounds likes Emme loves her bedtime routine, irrespective of what time in the evening it starts.  You know it&#39;s working well for her because she settles in and goes to sleep.  The routine will change along with Emme as she grows ... be open to that.  It sounds like Hannah enjoys the routine as well - the bath, the playing, the stories, the time with her parents - she&#39;s just not be ready to go to sleep at the end of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;We got ready and got into bed with them.  Hannah then proceeds to tell me, she may not be ready.  I said &quot;Do you want to get up&quot;  &quot;No, but I don&#39;t want to sleep.&quot;  I told her that she just stayed up until midnight and came to me to go to sleep.  It was like the conversation we normally have.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say to her that you&#39;re just doing what she asked.  It&#39;s pointing out your frustration with her that she can&#39;t figure out what she wants/needs.  She&#39;s not doing it on purpose to frustrate you; it&#39;s likely just as frustrating for her.  Instead take some time to try to help her figure it out.  Your suggestion of laying down and rubbing her head worked well that night, you knew she was tired.  Other nights if she doesn&#39;t take to that one, try some others you think she might be amenable to ... bringing some quiet toys to bed to play with, reading another story, or getting up to play quietly or watch a movie.

I have it easy<br/>\nbecause I only have one dd, who is definitely a night owl. I may have missed<br/>\nthe answer to this question in the prior posts, but why do both girls have<br/>\nto go to bed at the same time? Maybe they could have their sleeping and<br/>\nwaking staggered to accommodate the different needs. Why does the younger<br/>\ngirl have to have a routine just because Emme needs it? It sounds like it is<br/>\nmore of a wanting your attention issue than a bedtime issue. We have found<br/>\nthat sometimes Jayn will just watch tv quietly (all her most favorite<br/>\ncartoons are on in the wee hours) in bed while her father and I snooze. I<br/>\nusually come half awake at some point to find her sleeping and switch off<br/>\nthe tv. If her dad has to get up early for work, I will stay in the darkened<br/>\nliving room with her while she watches, and I snooze on the sofa. I will get<br/>\nup and carry her in to our bed once she is actually asleep. When my dh was<br/>\nsick with a nasty flu recently we slept out there to avoid disturbing each<br/>\nother, and I think Jayn really likes the sofa as a bed room. It is<br/>\ncomfortable enough but not as nice as our bed for my back. James and I try<br/>\nto have our together time in the morning before Jayn gets up � not always<br/>\npossible if I have been kept awake and need to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
