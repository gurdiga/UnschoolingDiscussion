We spent our first night away from him this last<br/>\nweekend.  He slept with his cousins, which he practiced a couple of<br/>\nweeks ago on New Years weekend<br/>\nwhen we were there also.  People kept saying that it will be easier for<br/>\nhim to not sleep with you if he starts sleeping on his own at home.<br/>\nThis issue wasn&#39;t him not sleeping with us, the issue was for him to be<br/>\nable to sleep with others such as cousins or friends when they come over<br/>\nto spend the night.  He had an okay night, cried a bit and worried that<br/>\nwe wouldn&#39;t be back.  His uncle listened and talked to him, said he<br/>\nbored him to sleep.  Our son said he&#39;s willing to do it again.  His next<br/>\nchance will be five days with grandparents and two other cousins on a<br/>\ntrip this summer.  We&#39;ll celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary then.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15107,"nextTopicId":15110}}
