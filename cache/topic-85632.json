And<br/>\n&gt; you said to her, &quot;I don&#39;t want a report&quot;.  Now I trust that you had a<br/>\n&gt; good reason but can you explain why you responded like this? I would<br/>\n&gt; like to understand fully. I&#39;m thinking that maybe you wanted her to<br/>\n&gt; understand that a report is written when someone wants one for a real<br/>\n&gt; reason. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As it turned out, I laminated it and used it in a workshop on writing.  <br/>\n&gt;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-A lot of parents, even unschoolers, would be tempted to try to,<br/>\n&gt; in a subtle way, encourage writing, or at least not discourage. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think you were really trying to discourage, but instead had some clear<br/>\n&gt; good intention.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We were joking around and I was telling them about school book  <br/>\n&gt; reports, and<br/>\n&gt; she said she wanted to write one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have a scanner working, but I&#39;ll try to put it up where people  <br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; see it someday.

If  <br/>\n&gt; I wanted<br/>\n&gt; you to read, I would have sent you to school.&quot;  He thought it was  <br/>\n&gt; hilarious<br/>\n&gt; that he was &quot;rebelling&quot; by learning to read against my will.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was along the lines of that when I told Holly I didn&#39;t want a  <br/>\n&gt; report.  It<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t the reverse psychology of &quot;no, no, I really don&#39;t want one,&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; though.  I<br/>\n&gt; really did NOT want one!!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     yes, I&#39;m starting to get it. This is very helpful in seeing  it  <br/>\ndifferently--plus what you wrote just below.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The last few years I taught, book reports took the form of private<br/>\n&gt; discussions, with the  book in hand and the kid could look things up  <br/>\n&gt; to read me good<br/>\n&gt; parts or find characters&#39; names if they needed to.   I didn&#39;t care if  <br/>\n&gt; they said<br/>\n&gt; they didn&#39;t like the book, or that they had stopped &quot;here&quot; and showed  <br/>\n&gt; me how<br/>\n&gt; far they had gotten before they decided to bail.  The point was to  <br/>\n&gt; discuss<br/>\n&gt; something they had read (rather than to have finished and summarized a  <br/>\n&gt; book).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do that sort of thing with my kids all the time, so the traditional  <br/>\n&gt; written<br/>\n&gt; book report to prove the book had been read, or to practice writing  <br/>\n&gt; reports<br/>\n&gt; (I shudder at that justification) has no place in my life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-But he didn&#39;t mention the<br/>\n&gt; writing so I didn&#39;t. I peeked later without him knowing. I was very<br/>\n&gt; curious about the content and somewhat about the spelling. He was<br/>\n&gt; writing about Six Flags! It was cute.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I noticed someone criticized your looking.  If he wanted it secret he<br/>\n&gt; could&#39;ve hidden it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     Yes, I think it really depends on the kid and the situation. I know  <br/>\nthat he knows that he can tell me anything. I also<br/>\n     know that it was highly unlikely that the content would have been  <br/>\nanything other than &quot;light&quot; in nature. In a situation<br/>\n     where there is a lot of love and respect and acceptance, there is  <br/>\nnot much reason to hide anything.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids and husband read over my shoulder lots of times.  If I have  <br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; secret to write (which is rare) I do it in secret.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Marty and Kirby share my computer sometimes.  Sometimes they leave  <br/>\n&gt; files<br/>\n&gt; open.  Sometimes I&#39;ve had to look at an &quot;untitled&quot; or oddly named file  <br/>\n&gt; on the<br/>\n&gt; desktop to see where to put it.  I see their writing there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of the things I read into the record at that workshop (or at least  <br/>\n&gt; passed<br/>\n&gt; around for people to see) was some online role playing stuff of  <br/>\n&gt; Kirby&#39;s.  It<br/>\n&gt; was really good.  Its goodness wasn&#39;t in technicalities, but in the  <br/>\n&gt; aliveness<br/>\n&gt; of the language, in the &quot;voice&quot; of the character, and in the  <br/>\n&gt; tenderness of the<br/>\n&gt; treatment of the other character (he was being the dad to a young  <br/>\n&gt; daughter,<br/>\n&gt; and this wasn&#39;t a &quot;public&quot; scene, but was in a chatroom, just the two  <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; them---part of &quot;storyline,&quot; but not in the way of in-person D&D games  <br/>\n&gt; in front of<br/>\n&gt; the whole group).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got Kirby&#39;s permission to use that, though, before I used it.  I  <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; his permission to read it before I read it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that he has his own computer, I wouldn&#39;t look at anything on there.<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s on my physical or electronic desktop for me to have to move or  <br/>\n&gt; clean up,<br/>\n&gt; though, seems fair game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids know my passwords.  They can look at stuff on my computer.   <br/>\n&gt; Things I<br/>\n&gt; want to keep close (Christmas notes and such) are named things they  <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think to look in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I found one of Marty&#39;s role playing scenes the other day.  It was  <br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; sweet too.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s never cause in school to &quot;write something sweet.&quot;   All the  <br/>\n&gt; sweet<br/>\n&gt; stuff is love notes and they&#39;re confiscated and the kid&#39;s in trouble  <br/>\n&gt; for writing<br/>\n&gt; and passing them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     This is such a good point. And in both instances, they did not hide  <br/>\nthem. Especially<br/>\n     interesting because they are boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-Sorry this is long. Thanks for reading! And thanks for the talk by<br/>\n&gt; you and Richard.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well you&#39;re welcome. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are two other tapes of co-presentations by Richard and me.  I  <br/>\n&gt; think<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re both better than the one on writing.   One is &quot;To Question or  <br/>\n&gt; Not to<br/>\n&gt; Question: That is the Question,&quot; and &quot;Peaceful Parenting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>     Yes, I have the &quot;To Question&quot; one. It is very good. I&#39;m gonna  <br/>\nlisten again since knowing<br/>\n     you think its better. I will get the other one which I did not know  <br/>\nabout.
