It changes constantly. He goes<br/>\nto work at 3pm or 2am or 6am or whenever is gone for<br/>\n24 hours (at least) or a week, but usually about 3<br/>\ndays(and nights). Off time is 24 consecutive hours<br/>\nsupposedly once per week. If the 24 hours starts at<br/>\nnoon it is over at noon the next day, so that there is<br/>\nnot a complete daylight off day. At the moment (for<br/>\nlast month) his schedule allows 2 complete daylight<br/>\ndaysand one night in between every other week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMet another RR wife who suggested a support group.  I<br/>\ntold her that would be fun, except we could never<br/>\nschedule any meetings. DH and I have been married 9<br/>\nyears and I still haven&#39;t adapted.......<br/>\n<br/>\nHe runs trains in the SE from Jacksonville, FL.  Today<br/>\nhe is in Pensacola, FL.  He left day before yesterday,<br/>\ndunno when he&#39;ll be back, exactly. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis back was broken 4 years ago when the locomotive he<br/>\nwas running became airborne when it hit a truck that<br/>\nwas stuck on the track in Savannah, GA. He did have<br/>\nabout a year off then, when he was unable to work (or<br/>\nanything else).  Then he had 6 months off two years<br/>\nago for the cancer surgery and the recuperation from<br/>\nthat. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is saddened that he is not able to do more in a<br/>\npatriotic sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe does like running large noisy machines so it is a<br/>\ngood job for him....I wouldn&#39;t like it....I don&#39;t like<br/>\nlarge noisy machines. And I wouldn&#39;t enjoy being<br/>\nunavialable to the children that I feel need me. Still<br/>\ntrains do have a romantic aura and the coaches aren&#39;t<br/>\nin close proximity to the engines...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry the answer to your question is so long, but<br/>\nactually, the schedule question is dificult (in more<br/>\nways than one) and the reference to &quot;Great job&quot; is a<br/>\nfrom point of view.....depends on what you compare it<br/>\nto.......<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gulfy@...\">gulfy@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This sounds like a great job!
