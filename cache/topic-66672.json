In the morning it&#39;s hard to tell where the little <br/>\nlake ends and the air stops.  But for a good cause (and especially if I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to be in a car all the way across the country to have it GRADUALLY go <br/>\nwet; that&#39;s rough) it might be doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nTruthfully, it&#39;s hard to breathe at first.  The first time I was in PA in <br/>\nAugust I said it felt like the air was full of plants and water.  But what <br/>\npeople who are used to high desert air have to do is get a new breathing <br/>\nrhythm and just breathe very shallowly.  There&#39;s a LOT of oxygen to be had, <br/>\nhardly breathing.  And a deep breath can hurt.  Your lungs get too full and <br/>\nyou&#39;re still breathing in and it&#39;s like a cramp nearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it made me more sympathetic for people going the other direction, who <br/>\nwould get out here, and up here (a mile high where I live, and they often see <br/>\nthe mountain and say &quot;let&#39;s go up there!&quot; but it&#39;s another whole mile!) and <br/>\nthey&#39;re breathing shallowly as they&#39;ve done for years or a lifetime, and it&#39;s <br/>\nnot doing them as much good as it did before.  They get tired and <br/>\nlight-headed and now I know what to coach them to do.  For years I had no <br/>\nclue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66755,"nextTopicId":66588}}
