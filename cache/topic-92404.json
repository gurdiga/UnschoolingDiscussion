The <br/>\nproject includes dissemination and extensive internal and external evaluation.   <br/>\nNational Science Foundation<br/>\nAward Number 9819107<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning and understanding mathematics, at every level, requires student <br/>\nengagement. Mathematics is not, as has been said, a spectator sport. Too much of <br/>\ncurrent instruction fails to actively involve students. One way to address the <br/>\nproblem is through the use of manipulatives, physical objects that help <br/>\nstudents visualize relationships and applications. We can now use computers to <br/>\ncreate virtual learning environments to address the same goals. <br/>\nPrior to this time, there has been very little done to create good <br/>\ncomputer-based mathematical manipulatives or learning tools at elementary and middle <br/>\nschool levels with any degree of interactivity. Our Utah State University team is <br/>\nbuilding Java-based mathematical tools and editors that allow us to create <br/>\nexciting new approaches to interactive mathematical instruction. The use of Java <br/>\nas a programming language provides platform independence and web-based <br/>\naccessibility. <br/>\nUltimately we will make all materials available at several sources on the <br/>\nInternet, creating a national library from which teachers may freely draw to <br/>\nenrich their mathematics classrooms. The materials will also be of importance for <br/>\nthe mathematical training of both in-service and pre-service elementary <br/>\nteachers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92385,"nextTopicId":92335}}
