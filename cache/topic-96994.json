She&#39;s<br/>\nrequested that I call her &quot;Secret Agent Sarah&quot; when<br/>\nshe&#39;s on the computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nLogan has been spending as much time as he can on the<br/>\ncomputer too. I think we&#39;re going to end up having to<br/>\nbuild 3 more computers so that everyone has their own!<br/>\nBut he&#39;s also begun spending quite a bit of time<br/>\nbuilding towns to drive his Hot Wheels cars through,<br/>\nwhich is nice. <br/>\n<br/>\nMegan just plays a little of this and a little of<br/>\nthat, but here lately I&#39;ve often found her sitting<br/>\nquietly looking at books. <br/>\n<br/>\nGracie has figured out that she can make the recorder<br/>\ntoot, so she&#39;s often just walking through the house<br/>\ntooting and laughing, or playing in the playroom. <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
