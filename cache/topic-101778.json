If we were out and about she&#39;d hand it to me to<br/>\n&gt; watch.  It would not even occur to me that, since she<br/>\n&gt; set it down, she&#39;s &quot;done with it&quot; and everyone else<br/>\n&gt; might have a turn with it.

If your <br/>\ndaughter gives you her ring to take care of, she isnt dropping it <br/>\ndown on the playground grass and forgetting about it. And if she DID <br/>\ndo that, and another child picked it up to look at it, i dont think <br/>\nit would be appropriate for her to tackle the other child to get <br/>\nthem to give it back. Its one thing if its a &quot;lovey&quot; like a security <br/>\nblanket, or even if its something the child is worried about getting <br/>\nbroken, but still, i think its not a good thing to bring a toy to a <br/>\ncommunity event if you are going to flip out if someone else touches <br/>\nit.

At the very <br/>\nleast, its not very nice or considerate of him. Yes, its his &quot;right&quot; <br/>\nto not let someone else see his sword. Just like it would be my <br/>\nright to bring say, yummy cupcakes to a gathering, but say &quot;Oh these <br/>\nare only for US, you can&#39;t have any!&quot; Its my right, but it seems <br/>\nlikely to cause bad feelings when its unnecessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying the child should be forced to share his toys. I&#39;m <br/>\nsaying that if he didnt want someone to play with his toy he <br/>\nshouldnt have brought it at all, or asked his mom to hold it for <br/>\nhim. Put it back in the car. Lots of options. But instead, when <br/>\nanother child picked it up he tackled that child and then his mom <br/>\ncalled the police. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child had something valuable, or he didnt want other kids to <br/>\nplay with it, and we had visiting children in our home i wouldnt <br/>\nsay &quot;oh you can&#39;t play with that&quot; ,i would put the stuff up out of <br/>\nsight. My son brought a gameboy with a saved game on it, to a <br/>\nlibrary day, and the kid who borrowed it accidentally erased his <br/>\ngame. Yes, that sucked, but my son knew ahead of time he was risking <br/>\nhis game if he let someone else play.

Do other kids <br/>\nbring toys they don&#39;t share or is it mostly this kid? <br/>\n<br/>\nI dont have a whole lot of support group experience, but i would <br/>\nthink that it might be good to bring up the subject of toys, and how <br/>\nto avoid this in the future.

I would call her. I think its terrible that she called the <br/>\npolice instead of talking to you about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, when my son was probably 4 or 5 yrs old, we were at McDonald&#39;s <br/>\nplayplace, and he was twirling around with a small plastic toy in <br/>\nhis hand. A little toddler wandered by and he accidentally smacked <br/>\nthe kid in the face really hard, and the little boy was hysterical. <br/>\nI tried to apologize to the parents and they looked at us like we <br/>\nwere evil, like my son was out of control or did it on purpose.

Your <br/>\nson could &quot;press charges&quot; against hers for starting the fight.

I don&#39;t think it  would <br/>\nget very far.  It&#39;s a &quot;school yard&quot; fight amongst 7 year olds.   Your child was <br/>\ntackled and could have been hurt as well.  It doesn&#39;t appear  to me that any <br/>\nbullying was going on.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat did the police say about the incident?  <br/>\n <br/>\nDid the other child suffer a broken limb or anything like that?  How  bad was <br/>\nhe hurt?  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d like to know more about that before I say anything else.  About  the <br/>\nsupport group, though...we&#39;ve had a similar thing happen in a  group.  It was a <br/>\nmuch younger kid whacking a much bigger kid with a  limb.  It was a particularly <br/>\naggressive little boy, and others were often  complaining about how he <br/>\nbehaved with his weapons.  It became a serious  issue after this incident.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHis mother was finally shocked into seeing what others had been saying, and  <br/>\nshe took decisive action.  I think the outcome was good, but this  particular <br/>\nmother was interested in making things better.  Sometimes  mothers are <br/>\nirrational and can&#39;t see beyond their own child&#39;s injury, no matter  how slight.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it was useful for our group to deal with the issue as a  whole.  We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a meeting or anything, but we had lots of phone  calls.  It was a <br/>\ntopic of conversation.  There has to be someone there  who can strongly <br/>\nadvocate for the peace, and for the cohesion of the group,  too.  Not everyone is <br/>\ngoing to be completely happy with how it shakes out,  but that&#39;s life.  Julie <br/>\nwill probably have something to say about that  incident, and what&#39;s happened <br/>\nsince.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe important thing, I think, is that if someone has a problem that makes  <br/>\ntheir experience unpleasant, and they desire to continue getting the other  <br/>\nbenefits of the group, that it should be addressed in some way.  Go to the  most <br/>\nactive and forceful leader or facilitator of the group and tell her what  has <br/>\nhappened.  Tell her what you&#39;ve told us.  Ask her advice and if  she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nthink it&#39;s big enough to talk about, go to the next one.  Of  course, this <br/>\ndepends on how much you want to fight for the group.  I  wouldn&#39;t be secretive <br/>\nabout it.  I would talk to the other mother directly  about it, too.  Apologize <br/>\nfor the kicking, without pointing a finger.   Give her an opportunity to take <br/>\nresponsibility for what her son did, as  well.  I look forward to hearing more <br/>\nabout the police.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"about Mary&#39;s support group problem","postDate":"1104149973","msgId":101778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkYi4zMjFhYTg0NC4yZjAxNTdkNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":101779,"prevInTime":101777,"nextInTime":101779,"topicId":101778,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yahoogroups disgorged a big pile of mail to me at once, and this one it seems was missed by everyone.

I was the parent <br/>\nwho sprinted to stop this, out in the field. It lasted all of 15 seconds. The <br/>\nboys split, the one who owned the sword was hurt from my son. My son needed <br/>\naway time for cool down so I left him alone. During the next 5 minutes I chatted <br/>\nwith the mom and the boy, making sure he was ok. He was a bit hysterical <br/>\nabout other things talking about trying to do what his counslers say to do <br/>\netc.They left without waiting for my kid to come over, so the boys did not get a <br/>\nchance to talk through what happened. Well, the mom called the police who showed <br/>\nup at my door a few days later. She did not try to contact me after the <br/>\nincident. She told the police I was overprotective of my son and she wanted it <br/>\ndocumented that he battered her child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you all think I should do? My son and I have talked about the group, <br/>\nhe actually doesn&#39;t like the kids there that much so one option is to just <br/>\ndrop hanging out with them. The group is active, I like the families and have <br/>\nbeen attending for several years. This mom is relatively new, she often has <br/>\npersonal toys with her that her child does not share and which causes similar <br/>\nconflicts. Part of me wants to open this up to the other 50 members for discussion, <br/>\nbut I hesitate to. My husband is a bit freaked out because the officer said <br/>\nthe family could press civil charges against us for this. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101714,"nextTopicId":101826}}
