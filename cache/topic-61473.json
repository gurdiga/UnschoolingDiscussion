It sounds like a helmet wouldn&#39;t have protected your brother as they do not cover the mouth area.<br/>\nHaving trwaled through the arguments many times (I cycle 100 miles a week and don&#39;t wear one) I discovered a few interesting things. Firstly, in any country where helemts are made mandatory, cycling<br/>\ngoes down. Since Govt&#39;s are trying to encourage cycling before we all tunr into spherical couch potatoes choking on car pollution, this seems a bit silly. they do better to make drivers ed compuslsory.<br/>\nmany drivers do not realise that the law in all 50 states (and in the UK and Canada) says that bicycles are vehicles and have a right to the road. The DMV manual tells them to pass a cyclist at 3 feet.<br/>\nSo far I&#39;ve never encountered anyone doing this. This makes the road dangerous for me. Cycling isn&#39;t dangerous, its those morons who are.<br/>\nWith regards to helmets. A study on car accidents found that a driver involved in an accident was more likely to suffer head injuries than a cyclist in an accident - the most common cycling injusr (if<br/>\nyou are not squashed flat which no helemt is gonna save you from...) is broekn collar bone. Given that there are 40,000 motorist deaths in this country every year, and many many more non-fatal accidents<br/>\nit seems to me than in order to cut down on head injuries, it is the motorist who should be wearing a helmet.<br/>\nCan you imagine the fuss if a motorist was made to wear a helmet? Being surrounded by 2 tons of metal makes them feel safe and more likely to take risks and therefore results in more head injuries.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said all that, I sometimes wear a helmet in the winter when I&#39;m cycling in the dark. I do this for two reasons. First, I&#39;m more likely to skid on ice and fall off and second, it gives me more<br/>\nplaces to put my reflective stickers and hopefully be seen and not run over by some woman yapping on a cell phone rather than paying attention to the road. The rest of the year I don&#39;t wear one.<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley the cycling nut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: safety equipment","postDate":"1048392349","msgId":61630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZjEwMWMyZjBmMSQ3ZDQ3M2I0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGI1ajdoaitxN3F0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61617,"nextInTopic":61677,"prevInTime":61629,"nextInTime":61631,"topicId":61473,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: kayb85  How embarrassing!!","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-343259021\">From: kayb85 <br/>\n  &lt;&lt;Actually, no, a big percent of kids don&#39;t wear helmets and I&#39;ve <br/>\n  never heard of anyone getting fined over it.

All the neighborhood kids that ride never wear helmits and neither do the people I see in the park here. Can&#39;t imagine them all doing that if they keep getting caught. Would be expensive after a while.

I was so excited because it was<br/>\nmuch nicer than the one I&#39;d had since I was eight.  Well, I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nwhat happened one day that summer, except I was unconscious in the<br/>\nmiddle of the road when a neighbor found me and took me home.  I was<br/>\n&quot;fine&quot; a little while later (no concussion) and the only thing wrong was<br/>\nsome skin scraped off my left leg.  But I never got on a bike again.  I<br/>\njust couldn&#39;t do it.  A few years later my parents sold it at a garage<br/>\nsale, and when I went to college they asked if I wanted another one (a<br/>\nlot of people rode bikes on my campus because the campus is so huge).  I<br/>\nwould rather walk. To this day, I would rather walk and I have no<br/>\nintention of ever riding a bike again.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo my kids don&#39;t see me wearing safety gear, but then, they won&#39;t see me<br/>\nriding either.  My son got a bike last spring when he turned 4 and he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like the helmet because at that time he had a tumor on his neck<br/>\nand the strap rubbed against it.  The tumor has since been removed and<br/>\nhe&#39;s been riding the bike on our porch and in our home with no helmet<br/>\n(yes, I let him ride indoors).  <br/>\n <br/>\nNow that it&#39;s spring again, I&#39;ll probably buy him another helmet because<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the law.  Then again, I do see kids without<br/>\nhelmets, so if he still doesn&#39;t like wearing one, I will probably not<br/>\nforce the issue.  But when he&#39;s old enough to ride a bigger bike, and<br/>\nwithout training wheels, I&#39;ll tell him about the accident I had as a kid<br/>\nand let him make an informed decision whether he wants to risk injury or<br/>\nwear the helmet.  I&#39;m not completely convinced that little piece of<br/>\nplastic and foam would really make that much difference though.  Could<br/>\nit possibly give kids false confidence?  Are there statistics somewhere<br/>\nabout head injuries before and after the helmet laws?  Maybe I&#39;ll look<br/>\nthat up.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorcha <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132800757,"authorName":"encadia@aol.com","from":"encadia@...","profile":"lasvegashillgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] safety equipment","postDate":"1048348866","msgId":61509,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMi4xYzk4MGQ2OS4yYmFkZTJjMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61507,"nextInTopic":61512,"prevInTime":61508,"nextInTime":61510,"topicId":61473,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just needed to chime in here.

If it&#39;s <br/>\nnot the law where you are (and you don&#39;t want to say it is), then it&#39;s one of <br/>\nthose things that you need to decide if it&#39;s enough of a safety issue to <br/>\ndecide for them or not. (Urban vs country, cul-de-sac vs busy street, etc.) <br/>\nWhatever it is though, do lots&#39;a talking with your child about it! S/he may <br/>\njust decide all on his/her own to wear them if they fully know what can <br/>\nhappen without the safety stuff. Maybe you could come up with a compromise, <br/>\nlike he wears the helmet, but doesn&#39;t have to wear the pads. (Head&#39;s now <br/>\nprotected, but skinning knee can show him he might rather have them on, but <br/>\nstill had his own power to make the decision.)
