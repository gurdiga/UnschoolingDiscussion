Its okay. What will really get them reading is the innate <br/>\ndesire to do what adults do - it&#39;ll happen. If they don&#39;t have such a <br/>\nstrong imperative, because they can count on you to do their reading <br/>\nfor them while THEY are working on other stuff  - the value of good <br/>\nlistening skills, for example, cannot possibly be overstated - after <br/>\nall, what do you think is REALLY important in college - what do college <br/>\nstudents spend most of their time doing? Okay, maybe partying comes <br/>\nfirst. &lt;g&gt; But in-class time is spent listening to lectures. The <br/>\nability to learn audibly is incredibly important and I&#39;ve really <br/>\nnoticed that the later readers, those who have been read to extensively <br/>\nand who listen a lot to audiobooks, are fabulous listeners even when <br/>\nthey do read on their own.

I don&#39;t need anything to unschool at the moment.  But I&#39;d take my<br/>\nson shopping at cool stores of all sorts and see what HE wanted.  Throw out<br/>\nthe catalogues, and buy what interests your family.  Go to a game store at a<br/>\nbig mall, the kind where they have lots of games out, and try them out.

Go see all the sights.  Zoo, museums, scenic<br/>\nvistas, whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGo shopping.  (See above.)  Have fun playing with all the toys and games and<br/>\nstuff that&#39;s out in the stores.  Decide if you&#39;d enjoy doing any of this<br/>\nstuff.  Dig through all the stuff at Salvation Army and see if there&#39;s<br/>\nanything good there.  (My cousin was thrilled to find a brand new fry daddy<br/>\nthere yesterday!  She&#39;s learning to fry donuts tonight.)  Go home and play<br/>\nwith all your new stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to the video store.  Rent movies.  Rent games.  Go to your friends<br/>\nhouses.  Borrow their videos, games, and computer programs.

If<br/>\n&gt; learning to read is what a child REALLY wants, would any of you get some sort<br/>\n&gt; of aides or maybe computer games to help them with this?  Would you just read<br/>\n&gt; a lot to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d read to them and with them.  There are lots of computer games and<br/>\nphonics teaching aides on the market, and I haven&#39;t seen a one that can do<br/>\nanything I can&#39;t do.  The biggest pieces of the reading puzzle are readiness<br/>\nand desire.  If they desire, but aren&#39;t ready, at least you are human enough<br/>\nto understand and support them during their frustration.  If they are ready,<br/>\nsurely you can help them with the sounds letters make, and help them with<br/>\nwords that don&#39;t make the sum of their sounds (such as light, tortilla, and<br/>\nthe).
