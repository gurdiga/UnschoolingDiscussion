I&#39;m sure you could find other unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTucson is actually a little more &quot;crunchy&quot; than Phoenix, I think... I also lived there for years, most recently in 2002, and found some other unschoolers - not as many as in California, but some.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe laws in Arizona are simple, just notify. I don&#39;t feel quite as secure with that as I do with laws that allow people to homeschool as a private school (like California and Kansas have), and 10 or so years ago there was a testing requirement in Arizona... and with the big high school exit exam thing there, they may change the laws and require tetsing again... but for now, it&#39;s a single notification.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n-- &quot;Brenda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lvmydd@...\">lvmydd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seriously considering moving to Arizona, the Phoenix area.

No tests, no intrusions. All you have to do is register with the Superindentent of Education and they send you lots of good info.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy boys play on school basketball teams which by law they are allowed to try-out for as long as they live in the area of the school. The kids accept them and the coaches love them. They could also take any one class at the schools but they choose not to.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope that helps, Joanne<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Anyhow, I love this group and have gotten such wonderful inspiration from you all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Brenda and I have a wonderful dd R who will be 5 next month.  We will be unschooling, continuing our path of life long learning.  I am a single mom currently living in So Cal.  But, I&#39;m planning to move out of the area as I just can no longer afford to live here and unschool.  Being able to work at home is my priority, so that I can be with my daughter and she can continue to learn whatever she desires.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am seriously considering moving to Arizona, the Phoenix area.
