It&#39;s <br/>\nboth embarassing and amusing to me now to recall how much that book <br/>\ninfluenced <br/>\nme at the time. The book said I deserved a lifestyle that wasn&#39;t &quot;childless&quot; <br/>\nbut child-FREE, and that sounded pretty good to me. I had a career and money, <br/>\nmy <br/>\nown place, my own car, and complete control over how their daily use and <br/>\nmaintenance.<br/>\n<br/>\n       It&#39;s an acceptable and even cheerful kind of compromise for me now, <br/>\nbut it wouldn&#39;t have been for that woman I used to be with my sporty little <br/>\ncar <br/>\nin the 70s. That woman would read this and think I was the one who had gone <br/>\ninsane. &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>\n***************************<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be great, though, if people REALLY spent time deciding whether <br/>\nthey REALLY wanted kids. Most people don&#39;t. Some people don&#39;t to tragic results. <br/>\nThe idea is that people should do what makes them happy. For some, raising <br/>\nchildren makes them happy and fulfilled. Other people have demanding work that <br/>\ndoes that, or want to play. It doesn&#39;t make them bad people to decide that <br/>\nthat&#39;s what they want. (I&#39;m not implying that you meant that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, it wasn&#39;t an issue of giving up little sports cars and going out to <br/>\nclubs and things. We were working in a day care center that we loved and <br/>\nenjoying playing with kids all day anyway. We went home and sat around the living <br/>\nroom. We figured...hey...our lives are already domestic and boring...might as <br/>\nwell have a kid.
