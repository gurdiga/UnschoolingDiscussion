I know you weren&#39;t naming anyone, but it&#39;s over <br/>\nsimplified<br/>\ngeneralizations such as you made that make Christians look like strange<br/>\nzealots.  I named you only so you knew what post I referred to, since the <br/>\nwhole<br/>\ngroup exploded about that time.<br/>\nI had just said I am Christian, and you come up with a post saying &quot;That&#39;s <br/>\nwhat<br/>\nChristians believe, I know!&quot;.  So I felt it encompassed me.  Not that you <br/>\nmeant<br/>\nme or directed it at me, but I&#39;m sure others know what I am saying even if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t.<br/>\nI can&#39;t help but wonder if you are being deliberatly obtuse, acting as if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t realize which post I am referring to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Does the list exist for people to be welcomed, or to exchange information <br/>\n&gt;  among homeschoolers?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know, this is a humorous statement coming from you.  I would say it&#39;s to <br/>\nexchange information, of course.<br/>\nAgain.......I was not saying I was upset by not being welcomed.  I said the <br/>\narguing<br/>\nwas so loud that no one heard any homeschooling discussion going on.<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen a couple of people now that want to say I am leaving because I was<br/>\nnot welcomed.  That&#39;s not true, that fact is only one aspect of many reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI THOUGHT it was about exchanging information among homeschoolers, but<br/>\nwas shown differently, as were many people who quietly agreed with me on<br/>\nprivate emails.  You now make the above statement to say it IS to exchange <br/>\ninfo,<br/>\nand yet you were one of the most vocal, saying inflamatory things about <br/>\nreligions<br/>\nyou don&#39;t truly show a respect for..<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  The political problem involved jumping on a family about raising dogs.  My <br/>\n&gt;  pointing to the juxtaposition of that and the earlier pro-life arguments <br/>\n&gt;  (also about politics) was jumped on as being personal, which is was not.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t thinking of EITHER of these posts.  I&#39;m talking about your <br/>\ngeneralization<br/>\nthat all Christians think they HAVE to save you, that everyone is sinful, etc <br/>\netc.<br/>\nYou went so  far in one sentence as to say &quot;I&#39;m serious, they really believe <br/>\nthat!&quot;&quot;<br/>\nWhen in fact, many many Christians do NOT.  <br/>\nMany of us hold ideas exactly opposite of what you state as FACT.<br/>\nI cannot imagine that any Hindu&#39;s, Pagan&#39;s, Buddhist&#39;s or any other religion<br/>\nrepresented here, would appreciate you over simplifying their beliefs and<br/>\nadding to anti-whateverreligion beliefs...<br/>\nI imagine that they, too, would mention that that is an oversimplisitic <br/>\ngeneralization<br/>\nthat is not true of many people in their religions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t find your pro life posts personal at all.  I understood you were <br/>\ngeneralizing<br/>\nabout RADICAL pro lifers.  It was your generalization on what YOU think the<br/>\nChristian religion is all about.  For myself and my family, your description <br/>\nwas<br/>\nfar from accurate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had the right to state your opinon, I also had the right to state mine.<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t like it, and others didn&#39;t care for how you said your <br/>\nopinon.<br/>\nSuch is life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Neither the presidential nor the dog overpopulation posts were mine.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ok, but I wasn&#39;t referring to either of them.  Others found other things <br/>\nobjectionable<br/>\nI guess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI joined several unschool groups at the same time as this one.  This is the <br/>\nonly<br/>\none that is soooooo disrespectful about people beliefs.  I cannot believe the <br/>\narguing<br/>\nhere, and am kind of getting upset with myself for responding and <br/>\nparticipating.<br/>\nYet I felt I needed to say something.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you can justify it any way you want, say it got personal, say you never <br/>\nsaid<br/>\nwhat you did, and claim I left because I wasn&#39;t welcomed properly.<br/>\nI&#39;m done deciding whether or not I&#39;ll stay, when well over half the posts are<br/>\nnegative and nothing to do with unschooling, it&#39;s an easy choice.  I&#39;m off<br/>\nto another less inflammatory group.<br/>\nYou can have the last word.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"benliam@aol.com","from":"benliam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9AgrQ0f8pPfFG_7-uKSA6jej4bTHJBvfvQYNP2-aPYxtCBWQoyYHHBh76ed8gk9LQlRkaZxv","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 969","postDate":"981124573","msgId":15746,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY2LmJjOWQ4OWMuMjdhYzFmZGRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15725,"nextInTopic":15765,"prevInTime":15745,"nextInTime":15747,"topicId":15725,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/1/01 7:33:04 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
