You know the ones. They go to <br/>\nOxford, they start their own successful business, write their first <br/>\nnovel at 16 or travel to cool places. Where do they get these people? <br/>\nThe unschoolers you know are all so ordinary- maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a long time unschooler, I&#39;ve watched many of the unschooled kids I <br/>\nknow grow to be adults. As they mature they all seem to become <br/>\noverachievers. Is it because they&#39;re extraordinary people? I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink so. They are just the same as everyone else. The difference is <br/>\nthat they have been allowed to lead extraordinary lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs these kids follow their interests and their passions, they take <br/>\ntheir activities to new levels. They enjoy the freedom and the <br/>\nsupport that so few young people in our culture are allowed. Most of <br/>\nthese kids will never make headlines or have books written about them <br/>\nbut they all seem to be moving ahead and enjoying their work to the <br/>\nfullest even in the simplest pursuits. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is exactly what I had hoped for my children&#39;s education and I am <br/>\nnot disappointed.
