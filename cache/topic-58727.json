I am also a &quot;last minute&quot; person.  I work much more efficiently under pressure of deadlines, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14 year old was NEVER the neat freak here as a child.  He was ALWAYS dumping stuff out all over the place and never could clean up after himself because it was too overwhelming for him.  He had NO concept of time management either.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, at 14, he *is* the neatfreak, even cleaning up after his sisters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave up trying to &quot;regulate&quot; him to clean up years ago simply because it just didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think its just a personality thing...or maybe a maturity thing.  I don&#39;t know.  I *do* know that regulating it doesn&#39;t necessarily make any difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, February 14, 2003 12:43 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] college and self-regulation (was Re: Junk Food/TV)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 2/14/03 7:45:27 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lelie@...\">lelie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; But on the flip side, don&#39;t you remember friends at <br/>\n  college (during the time they managed to stay) who couldn&#39;t focus and <br/>\n  get the work done, because they were so unregulated at home that they <br/>\n  never learned how to focus, and how to a plough through the difficult <br/>\n  stuff to get to their goal. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not me.<br/>\n  My experience with the hippie kids (having grown up in northern New Mexico) <br/>\n  was that they were some of the best students, and THE most responsible at <br/>\n  living off campus.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;one of the pitfalls of my <br/>\n  unschooling history is, lots of good ideas but no self-regulation to <br/>\n  put them into effect!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It might be an individual trait, and not a result of upbringing.
