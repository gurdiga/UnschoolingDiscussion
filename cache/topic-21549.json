We &quot;made reading available&quot; simply by always<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  having lots of stuff around to read, which we&#39;d have done whether we<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  had kids or not because we&#39;re both reading addicts<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For all of you who have always unschooled your kids, I&#39;m curious about the<br/>\n&gt; mechanics of how they learned to read. Did they pick it up on their own from<br/>\n&gt; having watched and listened to you, or did you use some sort of program when<br/>\n&gt; they indicated that they were ready?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My oldest (6) is partway through &quot;the process&quot; (and when does &quot;the process&quot;<br/>\nend, anyway? I&#39;m STILL learning to read -- every time I read a new word, or<br/>\nhave a bit of a struggle with a new written idea or way of phrasing).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting to watch. She started learning to read at about 2 months<br/>\nold, swatting at books I held. She soon graduated to chomping on them and<br/>\ndrooling on them (yes, she&#39;s gifted), then to looking at them, frequently<br/>\nholding them upside down, by the time she was 8 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe learned the alphabet from Barney and from being read to. She learned to<br/>\nwrite her first word from watching Nick Jr. (&quot;The first letter of &quot;FACE&quot; is<br/>\nF, then comes the letter A...&quot; -- she came downstairs with her Magnadoodle,<br/>\nshe was about 4 1/2, to show us). She sight reads some -- Pokemon, Pooh,<br/>\ncat, Clover (the name of our street), etc. She sounds out some, especially<br/>\nsince she likes the stories and humor in the &quot;Bob&quot; books.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is by no means &quot;ahead&quot; of what would be her classmates -- all of her<br/>\nBrownie troop reads. If in school, they&#39;d put on frowny faces and try to<br/>\nworry us over her. And, with her temperament, they&#39;d destroy her. Push Brit,<br/>\nshe turns into a puddle and leaks away. Push Mikey (little sister) and she<br/>\nturns into Mighty Mouse and sends you to the moon. Thank G-d we unschool. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully expect that Brit will continue to learn to read in dribs and drabs<br/>\nand occasional brilliant outbursts. I fully refuse to worry over it -- it&#39;s<br/>\nhappening, I can see it unfolding right in front of me, and her timeline is<br/>\nher own.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer sister may very well read much later than Brit. I worry over Mikey (3)<br/>\neven less, as she simply doesn&#39;t let other people&#39;s expectations affect her<br/>\nas Brit will. Brit might very well care if some child taunts her for not<br/>\nreading. Mikey would give them her &quot;Me Queen, You Peasant&quot; look and move on.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"7phSwC8N5oDlz6ZUvrnPW8yq4XlSkxBC9Aad3oeFtWe2ILk789_wvLt2NOTQLbfYVPVMukdP8nto4YsyMBsU7TzETQyDw96yGhpoBQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Candy with four who are doing just fine","postDate":"990419461","msgId":21562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNTIxMDQzMTAxLjczNDg4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZlLjY5NDdhMWQuMjgzOWViZjFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21560,"nextInTopic":21755,"prevInTime":21561,"nextInTime":21565,"topicId":21549,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Candy Thanks for the reasurrance....two boys and two girls, some of each!
