So you have a Lucy...tell <br/>\nher hello from another Lucy.  I was named after my grandmother, my mom&#39;s mom.<br/>\n     You asked about turning down the outside volume to hear your own <br/>\nvoice...I believe that we do have a core sense within us of what we truly <br/>\nbelieve.  One way that I keep that voice clear is by writing regularly in my <br/>\njournal, as I have done for years.  I also make time to read books and <br/>\narticles by people whose opinions I respect and whose beliefs are similar to <br/>\nmy own.  I also read differing points of view but when you are doing <br/>\nsomething which differs significantly from the mainstream, I think you need <br/>\nat least equal time in exposure to those who share your beliefs so that you <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel isolated from the rest of humanity.  This list has been one of my <br/>\nbiggest sources for that reassurance and support.<br/>\n     When I read things that ring true, that have a certain sound that I <br/>\nbelieve in, it gives me a sense of peace and connection to others.  That <br/>\ngives me strength when talking with others who may strongly disagree.<br/>\n      <br/>\n     Best Wishes on your own journey...<br/>\n<br/>\n     Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ptjlmbaldwin@earthlink.net","from":"ptjlmbaldwin@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Wt9cRBjxRYmrnu7og8ZKSX7EajmmNOA9Oa0Vz4PE3GGf7q_w8dMWaNgiZ6BJqoWVeDTfHBYW32WtRFEXBfGp8fM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"re: expectations of others","postDate":"948501907","msgId":5713,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNzcuNTcxMy45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5712,"nextInTopic":5715,"prevInTime":5712,"nextInTime":5714,"topicId":5712,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thanks Lucy in Ca.
