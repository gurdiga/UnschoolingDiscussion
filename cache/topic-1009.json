They would be<br/>\nfinishing up Kindergarten & 2nd grade if in school.  Since making the<br/>\ndecision to homeschool and unenrolling my oldest(son)from 1st grade<br/>\nafter 1 month, I have not kept any records.  I have boxes of artwork<br/>\nthey&#39;ve done.  I have a few workbooks around that they do from time to<br/>\ntime(less and less as time goes on).  We go on lots of &quot;fieldtrips&quot;(as<br/>\nmany as I can afford), a trip to Seattle the other day.  My dd, the<br/>\n6yr.old, mostly plays all day long.  We basicly do whatever tickles her<br/>\nfancy for the moment, and yesterday it was playing outside in the sun<br/>\nwith waterslides and waterballoons.  They both love puns, riddles,<br/>\njokes, and rhymes.<br/>\n\tMy ds is totally into collecting comic books all of a sudden.  I made a<br/>\npoint of taking him to a comic book store in Seattle, which was his<br/>\nfavorite part of our trip.  Yesterday, he read all 4 of his new comic<br/>\nbooks.  He tells me all about Spiderman and superman.  It is incredible<br/>\nthat he can read them so fast.  He reads books to his little sister all<br/>\nthe time to.  The comic book collection has just replaces his obsession<br/>\nfor Stars Wars, but since he was a toddler he has had a fascination for<br/>\nthings sci-fi(Alien flicks, etc.,).  O.K. so to give you an idea of what<br/>\nwe do.<br/>\n\tMy question:  Am I supposed to keep records for the &quot;authorities&quot; or<br/>\nsomething?  I am in WA state.

You are required to test or <br/>\nportfolio evaluate every year, but the results are yours, please don&#39;t pass <br/>\nthem on to the authorities, if they ask on the intent form you get, they are <br/>\nout of line.  That&#39;s probably the only must do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe law alludes to teaching xxxxx and having xxxx hours but there is no <br/>\nvehicle in the law that allows them to check anything.  Really, which I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever heard of happening in this state, if they did come and say show me what <br/>\nthe law requires you&#39;d only have to show that the took the annual test or <br/>\nhave an evaluation.  I&#39;m not sure they have the right to look at the results, <br/>\njust that it was taken.  Also, the 6 yo doesn&#39;t have to be listed on your <br/>\nannual intent form you mail to the district.  Just the 8 yo.  And, the 6 yo <br/>\nisn&#39;t required to be tested or evaluated until age 8.  Compulsory attendance <br/>\nis 8 in this state.  No one&#39;s required to send their kids to school until <br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":988,"nextTopicId":1020}}
