House Bill 4521<br>&nbsp;would \nrequire each Michigan home school child to take the \nMichigan<br>&nbsp;Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) test for each subject \narea in<br>&nbsp;which MEAP is administered to public school students in the \nchild&#39;s<br>&nbsp;grade level. Additionally, home school parents would have to \nsubmit<br>&nbsp;their child&#39;s completed test to the Department of the \nTreasury.<br><br>&nbsp;This is similar to a measure proposed just a few weeks \nago in the<br>&nbsp;Maine Senate. Maine home schoolers loudly objected to the \nstate&#39;s<br>&nbsp;trying to force their children to take the public school tests. \nBy<br>&nbsp;clearly conveying this opposition through an outpouring of \nphone<br>&nbsp;calls and packing out a legislative hearing room, home schoolers \ngot<br>&nbsp;their message across to their legislators and the bill was killed \nby<br>&nbsp;a joint committee. (For more information on the Maine battle, \nsee<br>&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=45).\">http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=45).</a><br><br>&nbsp;Here \nin Michigan, now is our opportunity to head H.B. 4521 off at the<br>pass, before \nit comes up for a floor vote. Every phone call is<br>&nbsp;important in the \neffort to defeat this dangerous bill.<br><br>&nbsp;REQUESTED ACTION:<span\n class=\"ygrps-yiv-2000265354170452201-03042001\"><font color=\"#0000ff\"\n face=\"Arial\">&nbsp;</font></span></tt></div>\n<div><tt><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-2000265354170452201-03042001\">&nbsp;</span><br>Please call as many \nH.B. 4521 sponsors (listed below) as possible and<br>&nbsp;give them this \nmessage:<br><br>&nbsp;&quot;Please withdraw H.B. 4521, which imposes unnecessary \ntesting<br>&nbsp;requirements on home school students. Home schooling works. \nThis bill<br>&nbsp;limits parental rights and is a waste of taxpayers \ndollars.&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;These legislators need to know that home schoolers in \nMichigan<br>&nbsp;appreciate their freedom and do not want to be regulated. The \ngoal is<br>&nbsp;to nip this legislation in the bud and to send a clear message \nto<br>&nbsp;prevent such onerous legislation from being introduced again \nanytime<br>&nbsp;soon.<br><br>&nbsp;SPONSORS OF H.B. 4521<br>&nbsp;Rep.

Michael Switalski, has already indicated that<br>&nbsp;he is \nnot interested in withdrawing the bill. He recently wrote, &quot;The<br>&nbsp;bill \nwas suggested by a constituent, and I agree with its purpose.<br>&nbsp;While \nthere are many good home schoolers who do their job<br>&nbsp;conscientiously, \nthere are a few who abuse the program and use it for<br>&nbsp;inappropriate \npurposes or to avoid scrutiny of a dysfunctional<br>&nbsp;domestic situation. \nSince oversight of home schooling is not<br>&nbsp;feasible, this testing would \nprovide a measure of review and<br>&nbsp;evaluation.&quot;<br><br>&nbsp;It is \nimportant for home schoolers to inform the sponsors of this<br>&nbsp;bill of \ntheir opposition. Even though you may not be one of these<br>&nbsp;legislators&#39; \nconstituents, they need to know that this bill will<br>&nbsp;affect all home \nschoolers&#39; rights.<br><br>&nbsp;Information Network of Christian Homes (INCH), \nalong with many other<br>&nbsp;organizations, joins HSLDA in opposing this \nbill.<br><br>&nbsp;We base our opposition on the following \nreasons:<br><br>&nbsp;The MEAP test is a highly content-specific test, based on \nthe state&#39;s<br>&nbsp;public school curriculum. It is not a nationally \nrecognized<br>&nbsp;standardized achievement test. Public schools teach students \nto the<br>&nbsp;specific content that the test covers, but home school families \ndo<br>&nbsp;not normally use the same curriculum as public schools. It is \nunfair<br>&nbsp;to test home school students on material they may not have \nbeen<br>&nbsp;taught.<br><br>&nbsp;No state in the country requires home school \nchildren to take the<br>&nbsp;state&#39;s assessment.<br>&nbsp;One of the reasons \nhome schooling is so successful is that parents<br>&nbsp;have a choice to \ndetermine the educational program that is most<br>&nbsp;effective for their own \nchildren. If home schoolers are required to<br>&nbsp;take the state assessment, \nwhich is based on the curriculum of the<br>&nbsp;public school, there will be \nunfair pressure on parents to give up<br>&nbsp;the curriculum they believe is \nbest for their child and instead teach<br>&nbsp;the public school curriculum. No \none wants his or her child to have<br>&nbsp;the stigma of a low score on the \nMEAP.<br><br>&nbsp;It is financially irresponsible to require testing of home \nschool<br>&nbsp;students when there is no evidence that home schoolers are \nfailing.<br>&nbsp;In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. Scores of \nindependent<br>&nbsp;studies conducted around the country and in Michigan prove \nthat home<br>&nbsp;schoolers on the average score 20û30 points above the \nnational<br>&nbsp;average on standardized achievement tests. (See<br>&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=46.)\">http://www.hslda.org/elink.asp?ID=46.)</a><br><br>&nbsp;Let&#39;s \nsend the message that home schoolers have earned the right to<br>&nbsp;be left \nalone.
