Someone I was really close <br/>\n  to, a singing and guitar playing buddy, a best friend, died early.  He had <br/>\n  grown up without a dad because of alcohol.  He left his kids because of <br/>\n  alcohol, and died in another state.  Both his parents were alcoholics.  My <br/>\n  mom was.  We both swore we would never drink.  I didn&#39;t; he did.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Alcoholism is common in my mom&#39;s family.  She has two of six siblings who <br/>\n  weren&#39;t alcoholics; the rest were.  Her dad was, her mom wasn&#39;t.   My sister <br/>\n  is, I&#39;m not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jon had two alcoholic parents, though, and most of his many siblings drank a <br/>\n  lot.  <br/>\n  His dad was Navajo.   Navajos seem to be passing alcoholism and Fetal Alcohol <br/>\n  Syndrome on at an alarming rate, compared to other groups in the area.  <br/>\n  Apaches too, I hear (even worse, I&#39;ve heard) but I don&#39;t know any Apaches.  <br/>\n  I&#39;ve never lived where they did.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Families are BADLY harmed by alcohol.  My brother&#39;s girlfriend/partner drinks <br/>\n  constantly.  Who&#39;s taking care of her kids?  I don&#39;t even know.  Five kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  If it&#39;s clear to anyone why so many Navajos are drinking, and if I&#39;m racist <br/>\n  to say genetics are a factor, that&#39;s crazy.  If it&#39;s &quot;simply&quot; the fault of <br/>\n  &quot;white people&quot; (not a term used in New Mexico much), THAT is racist.   Do <br/>\n  individuals not have free will?  Jon did.  He knew before.  He knew during.  <br/>\n  He knew how to stop.  He knew what it was like to be without a dad.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  My mom knew.  She knew during.  She stopped for nine years.  She could stop <br/>\n  again but she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Whose fault is it that so many anglos in New Mexico and Texas are in genetic <br/>\n  alcoholic lines?  My dad wasn&#39;t an alcoholic.  My mom&#39;s second husband was <br/>\n  BIGTIME.  My half brother didn&#39;t have a chance.  Does he drink because of <br/>\n  &quot;white people&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Seems racist to me to suggest that a whole tribe is drinking because of <br/>\n  outside factors, but that their neighbors drink for individual reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When someone is genetically pre-disposed, they just need to not drink, or <br/>\n  they need to go ahead and drink and not blame other people for that decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t go against what I see with my own eyes and what I know from personal <br/>\n  experience just to make someone vaguely more comfortable or justified in some <br/>\n  other state.  I can&#39;t pretend all American Indians are one homogenous group <br/>\n  any more than all Europeans are one homogenous group or all Pagans are <br/>\n  worshipping the same Green Man and the same spirits.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyone who would be happier if another person would just roll over and say <br/>\n  something they don&#39;t believe would end up with false agreement and no more.  <br/>\n  I can&#39;t be dishonest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling works the same way no matter who the kid is.  It doesn&#39;t matter, <br/>\n  when parents are helping kids learn in their own way at their own pace what <br/>\n  the kid&#39;s background, politics, IQ, genetics, ethnicity, <br/>\n  class/caste/height/religion.  I wish more people could do it, but I think <br/>\n  those who can and who want to should.  I think it leads to a dozen other <br/>\n  facets of life people never consider when they first hear &quot;unschooling.&quot;  I <br/>\n  don&#39;t think it should lead to censorship and shaming.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Other questions (accusations disguised as questions) were whether if a woman <br/>\n  says &quot;sexist&quot; that&#39;s proof.  No.  There are women promoting sexism <br/>\n  themselves.  There are women who convince themselves various ways to subject <br/>\n  themselves to men, even if the men are abusive.  There are women giving their <br/>\n  daughters dangerous messages.  There is one homeschooling curriculum with <br/>\n  different coursework for boys than girls.  Then there are men with a keen <br/>\n  sense of fairness who see men and women as equals and remind others to do so <br/>\n  too, when they have a chance.  Some men know more about sexism than some <br/>\n  women do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If someone knows a lot about Texas, for example, because of some personal <br/>\n  interest or fascination, just because I lived in Texas for a few years when I <br/>\n  was little doesn&#39;t mean I can say &quot;Well I know more about Texas because I&#39;ve <br/>\n  lived there.&quot;  If someone has lived there fifty years, they might know less <br/>\n  about some aspects or factoids or history than someone who has read, <br/>\n  interviewed people, and for whatever reason really cared to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The argument that some jobs should be just for men because men are stronger <br/>\n  than women lost out in the 1970&#39;s.  If strength is the issue, then go with <br/>\n  strength, not gender.  Unless we want to argue that it&#39;s okay to say the <br/>\n  weakest man is stronger than the strongest woman, why is it okay to say that <br/>\n  ANY one person who identifies himself as American Indian gets to speak for <br/>\n  all of them, and will be able to veto the experience or opinion of someone <br/>\n  who isn&#39;t Indian or is only 1/4 instead of half, or WHATever.  Information is <br/>\n  information, and some people don&#39;t have all that much.  Propaganda is <br/>\n  propaganda, and some people have LOADS of it, and don&#39;t care to decide what&#39;s <br/>\n  true and what&#39;s sensationalism.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Some kinds of propaganda aims at prevention of learning.  It says &quot;Here are <br/>\n  the simple answers, just trust them.  Don&#39;t look at anyone else&#39;s answers, <br/>\n  just those I&#39;ve just given you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It seemed today that saying &quot;There are other factors&quot; was met with &quot;Then <br/>\n  you&#39;re a racist.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think unschooling works very well with anyone&#39;s checklist of what not <br/>\n  to read, or what not to allow, or what not to watch.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  But I think this discussion started with questions about what to get for kids <br/>\n  for history, didn&#39;t it?  More than one source, primary sources are good... <br/>\n  and we came to this yucky fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wish it hadn&#39;t happened, and I&#39;m sorry if people&#39;s feelings were hurt.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
