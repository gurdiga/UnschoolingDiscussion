When they were little & dh was home, or help was available - I made a point of taking one of the 4 with me on errands, shopping, etc.   They all understood the game plan - (though they didn&#39;t always like it) and just being alone with mom - even if it was just to run errands was a chance for us to talk, play & enjoy.  At home my son cld easily be absorbed in an activity, and 2 of the girls (at 2 yo) cld be drawn into their own activities in the same room  (play doh & gadgets to press into it work great!) - Thus allowing me to spend time with 1 of them reading, playing - cooking in the kitchen, etc.  My ds got 1:1 time when the girls napped, or in the evening when the girls were already asleep.  There were other opportunities when I cld take ds to an event & have a friend watch the girls.  One of my favorite times for 1:1 was bed time - 3 wld play downstairs with dad while I rocked, read & chatted w/ 1 - then I wld take that 1 and tuck them in; repeating the process through the  girls (they shared a room - so the rocker was in the den).  Ds ended up w/ 1:1 w/ dad and me!  He knew once the girls  were in bed - I was his, we&#39;d snuggle in bed, read stories, talk, play a quiet game, whatever until he was ready to sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow - 3 will be on computers while I have 1:1 time with the 4th, and we rotate through - not necessarily all in one day but I still manage to get in the 1:1 fairly regular.  Cub Scouts is a 1:1 time w/ ds too.   If it&#39;s any help, it does get easier as they get older.  I try very hard to make the 1:1 time happen - but allot of the time I find that can happen when we&#39;re all out somewhere and 1 will walk w/ me, sit next to me, etc. and naturally get some focused attention.  We&#39;re a large family (8 in all- 6 at home) and we enjoy being together - reading, playing, watching a show/cartoon, cooking, brushing the dogs, cleaning the little critter cages, and lately even housework!  1:1 comes in snippets of time and blocks of time.  Sometimes it&#39;s just taking a moment to really listen to or look at what 1 child is bringing to you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] One-on-one time w/more than one child","postDate":"1078786645","msgId":91701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY3QkJFQTg1LTcxNTMtMTFEOC04QUU1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDUwMWM0MDU2MCQ2MjNkNGI4MCRlZGJkYjFkOEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWM0MDU1MSRhM2VmMTBlMCQ3NmQwMDVjZkBXYWxsaW5nZm9yZD4gPDAwNDUwMWM0MDU2MCQ2MjNkNGI4MCRlZGJkYjFkOEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":91700,"nextInTopic":91702,"prevInTime":91700,"nextInTime":91702,"topicId":91698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It also helps to remember that, although the older sibling tends to get more one-on-one time with the parents, the younger sibling gets the addition of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1737751280\">It also helps to remember that, although the older sibling tends to get  <br/>\nmore one-on-one time with the parents, the younger sibling gets the  <br/>\naddition of interaction with an older sibling.
