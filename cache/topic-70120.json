Meaning it&#39;s not necessary for all children at a certain age.<br/>\nWhether they are in school or not.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree totally.  Ethan my 11 yo has never really had any close friends and <br/>\nhe doesnt care to have any.  He never complained that the didnt have any <br/>\nfriends in school, but he DID complain about how mean the other kids were to <br/>\nhim.   I thought that maybe he was just afraid to try to make friends, he <br/>\nfeared rejection.   Now that he has been home for 5 months, he shows <br/>\nabsolultely no interest in making friends.   He will play with other kids if <br/>\nhe is in a situation, but he would just as soon pass on it.   I really think <br/>\nhe is just an introvert that does not need others to &quot;occupy&quot; him.   My dh is <br/>\nmuch the same way.   Anna and JP enjoy being around other kids ( all ages) <br/>\nand they tend to seek them out and easily engage in play and conversation.  <br/>\nBut, they don&#39;t sit at home and feel lonely without thier friends.  When Anna <br/>\ncame out of school, she missed her friends.  She had friends that she saw and <br/>\ntalked to every day and she missed that.  But, obviously, she didnt miss it <br/>\ntoo much because she didnt make any efforts to stay in touch with her school <br/>\nfriends<br/>\n<br/>\n   Really, I think I worry more over her &quot;friendships&quot; or lack thereof, than <br/>\nshe does.   I recall my  own youth ( and what other point of reference do I <br/>\nhave, personally, I mean?) and I remember having lots of friends, lots of <br/>\ntalking on the phone, sleepovers, day trips, and I loved every minute of it.  <br/>\n  I have to keep reminding myself that Anna is not me.  Her life is not like <br/>\nmine was.   And, even though she may not have the busy social life that I <br/>\nhad, she has LOTS and LOTS of other things that I didnt have.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"having friends: was Mary B.","postDate":"1053459237","msgId":70120,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2UwMWMzMWYwNiRjMWJmMjQyMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM2LjQwNmJiYTI1LjJiZmFmNjUyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":70155,"prevInTime":70119,"nextInTime":70121,"topicId":70120,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1015877954\">From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It&#39;s just that the things she does don&#39;t include other<br/>\nkids her age  We are still hanging in there and looking for opportunities<br/>\nfor<br/>\nher to meet some homeschool friends.
