She tells you what  <br/>\nto do and peers over your shoulder at how well you&#39;re doing and  <br/>\ncriticizes when you aren&#39;t doing &quot;as well as you should&quot; eg, not  <br/>\nmeeting her standards. When you&#39;re done she says, thanks, you can go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother friend calls you up and asks if you wouldn&#39;t mind helping her  <br/>\nout on her car since she needs a third pair of hands. She recognizes  <br/>\nthat you have more important things to do and please do feel free to  <br/>\nsay no. If she asks you to do something you aren&#39;t doing well at she  <br/>\napologizes for asking that you do something that was more difficult  <br/>\nthan she thought. When she&#39;s all done she invites you in for a snack  <br/>\nor, as a way of saying thanks for interrupting things that were more  <br/>\nimportant for her, offers to take you out for lunch or take your kids  <br/>\nfor the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother friend never tells anyone when she needs help, never invites  <br/>\nanyone over even just to keep her company.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich friends would you like to keep and which would you like to dump?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid my mother did all the housework. She had assigned  <br/>\nchores when she was young and she hated it and swore she&#39;d never do  <br/>\nthat to her kids. And she didn&#39;t. The housework all belonged to her.  <br/>\nShe didn&#39;t share it. She didn&#39;t invite us along to be with her. Her  <br/>\njob was to clean the house and take care of our needs. Our job was to  <br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe must have pictured that when we were &quot;old enough&quot; (teens?) we  <br/>\nwould then spontaneously start helping. I remember her being angry  <br/>\nthat my sister and I weren&#39;t naturally pitching in. It was rather  <br/>\nbaffling to me and my sister why she&#39;d taken care of everything on  <br/>\nher own all along and now all of a sudden she needed help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe aren&#39;t talking about the last friend (or my mom) who never asks.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re recognizing that being someone who is pleasant, who appreciates  <br/>\nthat others have important things to do (even if those things don&#39;t  <br/>\nseem important to us) is someone we want to help. And the person who  <br/>\nexpects us to help and is critical when we don&#39;t meet their standards  <br/>\nisn&#39;t someone we want to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re recognizing that by making kids do chores we&#39;re modeling for  <br/>\nthem that when you want someone else to do what you want that a good  <br/>\nstrategy is to be bigger and stronger and make them. And yet when  <br/>\nchildren use that tactic -- the tactic we use on them -- on others we  <br/>\nwonder what&#39;s wrong with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want our children to be kind and thoughtful and treat others  <br/>\nwith respect we need to model that for them. We can make kids *act*  <br/>\nrespectful and act kind and act thoughtful but when we stop making  <br/>\nthem and give them the choice, they&#39;re unlikely to want to be kind,  <br/>\nthoughtful and respectful of those who don&#39;t treat them that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill people who make their kids do chores get more help? To some  <br/>\nextent it seems that way while they&#39;re under our control. It will be  <br/>\npaid for by anger and resentment (from parents and kids) and kids who  <br/>\nwould rather be anywhere else than with us. It&#39;s more likely to  <br/>\ncreate kids who want to be away from us as teens and adults. So we  <br/>\nwill have traded something temporary -- straightening up -- for  <br/>\nsomething permament -- a lesser relationship with our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; My mother said,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; as her mother said, &quot;You eat, don&#39;t you? Then you can help clear the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; table/clean up the dishes.&quot;`<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And how did you feel about that as a child?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like from your shock that your mother filled you with a  <br/>\nfeeling of resentment towards housework and feeling that it isn&#39;t  <br/>\nfair if others don&#39;t help. And now that the burden of housework is on  <br/>\nyour shoulders you don&#39;t care that your children feel resentful or  <br/>\nangry at helping. It&#39;s only important that you not do it all yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;re passing that resentment onto your kids. Who will pass it  <br/>\nonto their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I met a woman who said to clean up after her (only) four-year old son<br/>\n&gt;&gt; was like a &#39;gift&#39; to him, to re-set his toys. I looked at her,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; wondering exactly what drugs she was on. I&#39;ll bet his future spouse<br/>\n&gt;&gt; will want to kick her butt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Why should the children take no responsibility?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are defining the word responsibility differently for adults and  <br/>\nfor children and then treating the two as though they were the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to think of one responsibility that you as an adult have that you  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t *choose* to take on and that you can&#39;t walk away from. There  <br/>\nmay be many you wouldn&#39;t walk away from -- a marriage, your kids,  <br/>\npaying taxes -- but the truth is that you *could* walk away. There  <br/>\nmay be many you don&#39;t feel you had a choice about like caring for an  <br/>\naging parent, but the truth is you *could* make other arrangements  <br/>\nbut for whatever reasons (guilt, financiall) you *chose* to take it on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responsibilities we *choose* to take on for ourselves we get to  <br/>\ndecide what standards we&#39;ll keep them at. If we take on the  <br/>\nresponsibility of a house, we get to decide how often to take out the  <br/>\ntrash, how often to scrub the toilet, when to vacuum: daily, weekly,  <br/>\nmonthly, yearly. We get to decide what quality meals to prepare:  <br/>\nquickies, mixes, takeout, scratch cooking, gourmet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responsibilities we *choose* to take on for others we get to  <br/>\ndecide how closely we&#39;ll stick to what&#39;s required. There are  <br/>\nconsequences to our choices -- our reputation may go down or up, a  <br/>\nproject may succeed or fail -- but we get to decide if the  <br/>\nconsequences are worth it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not the situation with kids. Kids don&#39;t have ownership of  <br/>\nthe tasks they&#39;re assigned to do. They can&#39;t decide to let something  <br/>\ngo. If someone assigns them the task of mowing the lawn they can&#39;t  <br/>\ndecide to turn it into a meadow. (An adult could decide that.) They  <br/>\ncan&#39;t decide the toilet only needs scrubbed every 6 months. (An adult  <br/>\ncould decide that and I have on occasion!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce Fetteroll<br/>\nNew old stuff at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":169605667,"authorName":"suzannadees","from":"&quot;suzannadees&quot; &lt;sdees@...&gt;","profile":"suzannadees","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Re: principles applied to chores, and how it helps unschooling","postDate":"1126843501","msgId":108326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRnZGc5ZCtkdDJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRnZDZtZCtyZTlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":108325,"nextInTopic":108327,"prevInTime":108325,"nextInTime":108327,"topicId":108316,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

How weird is that? Her kids never put away anything <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re done with it?

My kids are still <br/>\nvery little .... but I&#39;ll sometimes say, &quot;Could you please bring <br/>\nyour dish over to the counter if you&#39;re done?

Once I came into my bedroom and she was actually <br/>\nmaking my bed. A few days ago she said, &quot;Let&#39;s all clean up this <br/>\nliving room!&quot; and started putting her toys away. One day she <br/>\nannounced that she wanted to wash the car (and we all did it <br/>\ntogether.) She has seen me get out the vacuum and ask if she can <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she have assigned chores of any kind? No. Do I give her <br/>\nstickers or pennies for putting on her shoes or putting her toys <br/>\naway? No.  Will I get mad or punish her if she doesn&#39;t do something? <br/>\nNo. But has she done various things, at times? Yes. Happily. Of her <br/>\nown initiative and decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh -- another thing that helped me was the idea to treat the kids <br/>\nlike guests in your house. Yes, if I had dinner guests I might ask <br/>\nthem to hang out with me in the kitchen and talk while I cleaned up, <br/>\nand most likely they might say, &quot;Where should I put this?&quot; or scrape <br/>\na plate. But I wouldn&#39;t nag or chastize them, or tell them they&#39;re <br/>\nrude and lazy, because they didn&#39;t jump up to clear the table or <br/>\nwhatever.<br/>\n <br/>\nJenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I got private e-mail and below is the text of that and my response <br/>\nto her.   <br/>\n&gt; I sent an invitation for her to join this list, too.<br/>\n&gt; =====================================<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have three sons, ages 8, 4, and 2.
