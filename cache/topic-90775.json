Many schools are seeking out <br/>\nunschoolers, as the kids they&#39;ve recently had as students are SO interested and <br/>\ninteresting----as opposed to the typical high school graduates. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sitting in on a Sociology-101 class right now. It&#39;s pathetic to look <br/>\naround and see the apathy on the kids&#39; faces. They&#39;re PAYING (or at least Daddy&#39;s <br/>\npaying for them) to be there. They don&#39;t WANT to be there. They are so <br/>\ndisinterested! <br/>\n<br/>\nCameron and I are very involved in the class----asking questions, answering <br/>\nquestions, interjecting jokes, etc. The only other one in the class that gives <br/>\na rat&#39;s butt is the young man sitting next to me. He&#39;s Middle Eastern and glad <br/>\nto be there. The other kids are sleeping (one actually SNORED!), doing <br/>\nhomework from another class, day-dreaming, chatting with each other. And this is NOT <br/>\na boring class. Teacher is very animated and interesting and bright and <br/>\nengaging. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a night class. He said he prefers the night classes to day classes <br/>\nbecause he usually gets more adults that sign up. The kids are ALWAYS like this! <br/>\n<br/>\nSad.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90745,"nextTopicId":90801}}
