Two lanes, through dips, over very small <br/>\nbridges, as dark as can possibly be with deep arroyos to fall into, not one <br/>\nfilling station or phone (phones if you went up to houses in the three little <br/>\nformer-ghost-towns, now artist-colonies it goes through).  It&#39;s not half as <br/>\nsafe as the interstate.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I know the interstates were beefed up for military purposes. The Romans <br/>\ndid that too.  People COULD have travelled without Roman bridges, but once <br/>\nthere&#39;s a bridge, ferrymen aren&#39;t going to make much money.  But there was <br/>\nRt. 66 before there was I-40, and it wasn&#39;t considered a sin for the <br/>\ngovernment to have make pavement to California.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlbuquerque exists at the intersection of I-25 and I-40.  I-10 cuts across <br/>\nthe bottom of the state.  We have those, the federal court house, some <br/>\nnatioanal parks and monuments, and that&#39;s about it.  When I go to Washington <br/>\nI&#39;m in awe of the federal funding for things everyone can see and do, and how <br/>\nmuch easier it is to feel like an American there than it is in a place like <br/>\nEspanola, where I grew up, where the BIA and BLM are the only federal <br/>\npresences.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Just because something is there, and convenient, it doesn&#39;t become <br/>\nmandatory that every generation must continue to expand and increase it (can <br/>\nyou say PCB&#39;s?).-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the side roads were not maintained when the interstate went in.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how far you are from an interstate, but in New Mexico they are the <br/>\nonly way to travel from some towns to others, and especially in the southern <br/>\npart of the state towns can be very far apart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&gt; .

Unless some people <br/>\nprove that kids can learn to read without being taught, those trained in <br/>\ncolleges won&#39;t believe it.  I think my kids would learn either way.  I think <br/>\nthey&#39;re better off at home.  But I don&#39;t see the schools as an evil empire <br/>\nthat should be destroyed and and salted over.  School was good for me, <br/>\npersonally.  I could tell good school stories for days on end.  But schools <br/>\nare bad for lots of people, in ways that might could be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-What makes you think that you know so much that thousands of teachers and <br/>\nadministrators couldn&#39;t figure out?

They think they know much that thousands of <br/>\nteachers and administrators don&#39;t WANT to figure out--many (NOT ALL) are <br/>\ncontent to continue to take a paycheck until retirement without rocking the <br/>\nboat.

I don&#39;t expect anything from my kids that isn&#39;t reasonable. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did have a lot of experience with immaturity in the military, where 40 year old almost-retirees spend their time hanging out with 17 year old kids in bars. The view of &#39;extended puberty&#39; is blatantly obvious. Read more about our grandparents and parents&#39; lives, and imagine if our current crop of ps kids would have the maturity to do the things they did at the ages they did them. My Dad packed up 8 kids and the dog in a station wagon and moved to a frontier farm at the age of 30. (I&#39;m not saying this is the best thing, just that it took wisdom, skills, and maturity that I respect and wish I had.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible to unschool without identifying an enemy, but then, why would you &#39;un&#39;school? As a scientific experiment with your children? What makes you think that you know so much that thousands of teachers and administrators couldn&#39;t figure out? (You already answered this, then deny it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n    I started the cynicism you see around you today (just call me Al Gore :-) ). It isn&#39;t &#39;stylish&#39;. It is based on a mistrust of established paradigms. &quot;Stop Paving the Cow Paths&quot;  is a common saying (and a book, I think). The reasons for mistrusting established paradigms are manyfold, but it begins with the public screw-ups of our most trusted organizations, like the federal government, Exxon, and the U.S. military. As they say on TV, &quot;Trust No One.&quot; (yes, there are reasons why the cows choose those  paths, but not related to this side of the discussion.) All organizations have someone who can screw up.<br/>\n    This applies in the grand overall picture, but we know we must trust someone, so we bond with and trust the ones we know (local control), and distrust those we don&#39;t know. Love can only be had by taking the chance of free and open trust. You can&#39;t trust someone you don&#39;t know. That&#39;s just blind faith (&quot;We from da guvmint, we here to hep&quot;). Generally, I don&#39;t trust people who don&#39;t have strong opinions or enemies. They probably haven&#39;t done anything to warrant them (this rule is modified by an age factor, kids shouldn&#39;t have real enemies).<br/>\n<br/>\nDan<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Leslie","from":"&quot;Leslie&quot; &lt;leslie@...&gt;","profile":"fromthebeachhouse","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5_tfMrQc3D40Crx-RYIJpcAuucrfIYnjPkgdL7mpsyvhbln8n1AWkwjJRPtgwDntsdOyPiFVrGXGOUNMfMY3pHfBiw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Sandra is always right","postDate":"1005929109","msgId":27798,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNWYwMWMxNmViZSQwZTMzYzU0MCQwMzAwYThjMEBhbGFuLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDl0M2NwMys1M2pwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27795,"nextInTopic":27801,"prevInTime":27797,"nextInTime":27799,"topicId":27790,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" It s my understanding that we are all allowed to say whatever we","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1788745507\">&lt;Can someone please explain to me why Sandra can say just about <br/>\nanything she wants here,&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s my understanding that we are all allowed to say whatever we want!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Yet when she insults someone to the point where they get nasty <br/>\nback you are right there to jump in and defend her?&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure who all your talking about but if your uncomfortable with anyone&#39;s comments you should just ignore them rather than encourage further discussion by replying.
