My<br/>\nfreshman year I got my first C ever in a large lecture class - I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t see the instructor&#39;s lips to get visual clues for the lectures.<br/>\nMy second C was from an instructor who lectured with her back to the<br/>\nclass, while writing on the board.  But her chalkboard writings were<br/>\nonly part of the lecture - what she was saying sometimes changed the<br/>\nmeaning of what she wrote, so I didn&#39;t get it.  After those two<br/>\nexperiences I read a book called &quot;Smart but Feeling Dumb&quot; which talked<br/>\nabout &quot;auditory dyslexia&quot; (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not called that any more -<br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s part of auditory processing disorder?) and I put it all<br/>\ntogether.  Just like you, I use subtitles on tv shows.  I can&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand when someone reads aloud.  I feel asocial at parties because<br/>\nI can&#39;t understand what people are saying in the midst of crowded rooms.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a hearing problem - it&#39;s an understanding problem.  In grad<br/>\nschool I had to re-take the classes I got Cs in (they were central to my<br/>\narea of study and my advisors wanted to be certain I had a good<br/>\ngrounding in them).  In the 10 person round-table type of course at that<br/>\nuniversity, I aced both.  I think it&#39;s fascinating that our brains work<br/>\nso differently!  Why does a school system think they can effectively<br/>\nteach everyone the same material when all our brains learn in such<br/>\ndifferent ways???<br/>\nAlyson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"Vicki A.

Brenna loves to read  books and will <br/>\nusually read in the room with us rather than watch a movie.   She told me this <br/>\nmorning of being at an Odyssey of the Mind meeting last night  where a friend <br/>\nwas reading an explanation of a problem clarification and she  just couldn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand it until she read it herself.  Logan on the other  hand, will stop <br/>\nin mid step if he sees and hears a TV show or video game on  a screen and <br/>\ncompletely can tune out anything else in the room. He seems to be  able to process <br/>\nboth visual and auditory information easily but is stronger  <br/>\nlogically/mathematically than he is linguistically.<br/>\n <br/>\nI find it all fascinating.  I wish I&#39;d understood this in my college  years <br/>\nand even a few years ago when I tried to learn some Spanish with the  kids.  It <br/>\nmight have saved me a lot of frustration and possibly I  could have found <br/>\nanother method of learning.
