The older set goes to midnight mass, (after the<br/>\nexchange of presents and a super fattening dessert), then the younger ones<br/>\ngo to bed in new pj&#39;s given by grandma. Santa comes in the early morning and<br/>\nleaves small presents (wind-up toys, pens, scented soap, special<br/>\nchocolates), and always an orange in the stockings.  When ever I think about<br/>\nthese family gatherings I smile and can almost smell the pine and oranges!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though Santa is not a prominent feature at our house, my husband and I<br/>\nnever discouraged stories about him.  One of my favorite childhood books is<br/>\nour &quot;T&#39;was the Night Before Christmas,&quot; that I received on MY first<br/>\nChristmas - I still love to look at the drawings! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was 8 (she&#39;s almost 11 now), she began reading Judy Blume<br/>\nbooks.  I think it was the SuperFudge book that the main character revealed<br/>\nthat Santa was not real.  My daughter was very thoughtful after reading<br/>\nthat, and then asked me what I thought was going to be the BIG question<br/>\nabout Santa.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, she wanted to know &#39;&quot;But what about Rudolph??!!&quot;  And she would<br/>\nsay, &quot;Hmmmm, I really wonder, if reindeer would continue to fly without<br/>\nSanta?  If I could fly, I&#39;d do it all the time! Yep, I&#39;m sure they fly<br/>\nanyway!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it IS fun to believe or fantasize.  She wants to keep that magical<br/>\npart of childhood intact awhile longer.  She doesn&#39;t want to be told about<br/>\nreality when it comes to Santa or the reindeer.  She loves to tell and write<br/>\nstories, and she has two smaller brothers (7 and 3) who lap up every word. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut even in a family, there are always the realists -- Her brother was asked<br/>\nwhen he was 4 if he would like to go with Grandma and have his photo taken<br/>\nwith Santa.  He said, Heck no, he&#39;d wouldn&#39;t like to sit on some weird guy&#39;s<br/>\nlap who&#39;s dresses up in a costume!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the kids laughed and laughed!  No one was offended by his take on Santa.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that part of unschooling is just embracing all the stages without a<br/>\nnegative eye, and all the personalities.  As a parent I really TRY to do<br/>\nthat, but it is difficult sometimes.  Trust that your children will tell you<br/>\nin one way or another, their stage.  Also, as a parent I&#39;ve learned that I<br/>\nset the stage for my family&#39;s core values, but that my &#39;stage&#39; is just one<br/>\nof many choices available to my children.  Some of the traditions will<br/>\nremain with my kids as they mature - some will change or be discarded.  I<br/>\nhope the family gatherings and the decadent desserts remain!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I say don&#39;t sweat it - a little fantasy about Santa isn&#39;t going to ruin<br/>\nyour reputation as an &quot;honest&quot; parent.  Your everyday actions will have a<br/>\nlarger impact.  I have friends who were terribly bothered by their parent&#39;s<br/>\n&#39;lies&#39; about Santa.  But, then again, lots of things about their upbringing<br/>\nbother them.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGosh! I&#39;m almost in a December frame of mind.  What cooling thoughts on a 98<br/>\ndegree day!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rebeca     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96429,"nextTopicId":96719}}
