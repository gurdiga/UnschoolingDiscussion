She&#39;s been doing this for <br/>\nalmost 20 years and has studied with the inventer (Dr. Schimmel) and they <br/>\nconfer often on bringing Vega to its full potential. Using it to <br/>\ndetermine implications on a cellular level in addition to just using it <br/>\nfor allergy testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Occidental Institute which held the patent for the Vega offered <br/>\nclasses, so suffice it to say, most of the NA practicioners are in Canada.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not familiar withthe BioSet, although she most likely is.
