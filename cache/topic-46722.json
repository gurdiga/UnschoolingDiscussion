There lives during school turn sooooo unhappy, but they believe this is the only way they can live.  They live unschooled lives at those times, and don&#39;t even see it and then they bring their children to school with alot of kids that are not living their lives that way.  It really wreaks havoc on a childs inner self, very conflicting!<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping with me living the way I am they can see how wonderful unschooling your whole life can be.

We&#39;ve always believed that our children will <br/>\nlearn everything they need to know naturally and organically, in <br/>\ntheir own time. But there is a difference once my son hit school age. <br/>\nHis friends went off to school, and that was a big change for him, <br/>\nnot having them around the neighborhood all the time. Also, when we <br/>\nare out and about around the city during the day, it&#39;s obvious to <br/>\nothers that we&#39;re homeschoolers and we do get the occasional question <br/>\nabout it. Not huge differences, small ones, but they&#39;re there. <br/>\nMostly, we just get on with the same things we&#39;ve always done, <br/>\nfollowing our interests, wherever they might lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., louisam1@j... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; The reason I would be comfortable saying that I &quot;unschooled&quot; from <br/>\nbirth<br/>\n&gt; (with the 2nd anyway) is because I think that a lot of <br/>\nparents &quot;school at<br/>\n&gt; home&quot; from birth.
