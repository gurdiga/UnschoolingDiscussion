Bridget is almost 17 m/o and I don&#39;t get many breaks. From 4-9<br/>\nmonths (when she started crawling) she absolutely would not go to anyone<br/>\nelse. So I just went with it :-) Grin and bear it, lol! She has become<br/>\nmuch more independent, but is still very much a mama&#39;s girl. If I leave<br/>\nher with someone I have to sneak away. If she does not see me go she&#39;s<br/>\nfine, but if she sees me leave she gets very upset and I cannot leave<br/>\nher. Well, ok, I guess I could leave her. I mean to say I will not leave<br/>\nher when she is upset. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I only take showers on weekends now when her dada plays with<br/>\nher. During the week I lean over the tub and wash my hair. Yes, I&#39;m<br/>\nstinky, lol! But she does not like for me to shower. I think it scares<br/>\nher. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am enjoying this thread since I was feeling guilty about not bringing<br/>\nher to play groups. I&#39;m not a very social person myself, and we sleep in<br/>\nlate so we tend to miss a lot of morning stuff. However, after last<br/>\nweek, when another toddler attacked her in a store and an older child<br/>\nhit her, I am not inclined to go out of my way to find children for her<br/>\nto visit. She&#39;s getting plenty of socialization running daily errands<br/>\nwith me and seeing family. <br/>\n<br/>\nshannon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"czuniga145@aol.com","from":"czuniga145@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"EeHXhITIQ-zqlXHh0LC04YOEW_umfDrnMPwXEHDrtkgBEagQ_Ku8xbP3tdob5LT0wVQpxVrgpDbZ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: socialization- the little on","postDate":"951946546","msgId":6863,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzguNjg2My45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6861,"nextInTopic":6864,"prevInTime":6862,"nextInTime":6864,"topicId":6860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/1/00 1:18:14 PM Pacific Standard Time, tn-k4of5@idahopagan.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-423616955\">In a message dated 3/1/00 1:18:14 PM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tn-k4of5@...\">tn-k4of5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I could not agree with you both more.
