We would probably enjoy it right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe museum actually wasn&#39;t hard to set up at all, just time consuming in a <br/>\ngood way. But since it was Casey&#39;s idea she&#39;s loving every minute of it. If <br/>\nyou have a kid who likes collecting, sorting and labelling, then you&#39;ve got <br/>\na museum curator!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really has been (and Is) a fun project. We&#39;ve sorted and labelled all of <br/>\nour rocks, gems, shells, coins, feathers, fossils, etc. and put them out on <br/>\nsome folding tables. We&#39;ve also hung up our own artwork and labelled that <br/>\ntoo. Casey really wants people to take her seriously on this, so her dad and <br/>\nI have helped with making the labels, flyers and related terminology sound <br/>\nlike the &quot;real&quot; museums she&#39;s visited.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Casey got her first visitors and was thrilled. So far she&#39;s sold 2 <br/>\nfamily punchcards and 2 single admissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Please post some photos -- I bet lots of people would like to get <br/>\n&gt;&gt;inspired!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll see what I can do. But you don&#39;t need me to get inspired. If you think <br/>\nyour kids would like to try this, then go for it! Just look at what you&#39;ve <br/>\ngot and what you&#39;d like to share with other people. &lt;poof&gt; You&#39;ve got a <br/>\nmuseum in the making. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88778760,"authorName":"debi watson","from":"debi watson &lt;debiwatson@...&gt;","profile":"sheplusthree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Our House is a Museum!","postDate":"1027435613","msgId":39348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjEwMWMyMzI1NyRjOGUwOTQ2MCQyN2E2NTYxOEBlZC5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEYzNHZWbzhOVmZhTkhpOXU1dG8wMDAwM2U2MUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39345,"nextInTopic":39350,"prevInTime":39347,"nextInTime":39349,"topicId":39332,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Funny that it should <br/>\nhave happened right as Sandra posted that &quot;House as a Museum&quot; article.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend Casey decided that she really wanted to open a museum. She had <br/>\npreviously wanted to open a neighborhood library, but we never could figure <br/>\nout the logistics on that. We all decided that a museum could work though, <br/>\nso Casey gathered up all the items she wished to include, and I donated our <br/>\nguest room as the designated museum space.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve all been working with her this past weekend and it&#39;s really coming <br/>\nalong! There is an Art Gallery, Visiting Exhibit (donated by her brother <br/>\nConor), plus permanent exhibits on Sea Life, Life in the Forest, Indian <br/>\nArtifacts, and Rocks & Gems. Since we&#39;ve been collecting &quot;treasures&quot; for <br/>\nyears, she actually has an impressive amount of stuff. All of it is labelled <br/>\nand she even included some hands-on displays for touching and exploring <br/>\nunder a magnifying glass.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, no museum would be complete without a gift shop. Casey put <br/>\ntogether bead kits, snail shells from our pond and little plastic animals <br/>\nand bugs for sale.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve decided that our museum will operate as a non-profit. Casey said she&#39;s <br/>\nin it for the fun and opportunity to share her collections with others. <br/>\nShe&#39;s priced admissions to merely cover expenses-5 cents per visit or a 10 <br/>\npunch pass for 25 cents. And yes, we have printed up the punch cards. We <br/>\nalso printed a flyer announcing the opening and distributed it in the <br/>\nneighborhood yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if any of you happen to be in Park City, UT and would like to visit a <br/>\nfabulous museum, perhaps the only one with an 8 year old curator, please <br/>\nstop by!<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39346,"nextTopicId":39353}}
