The guys have been asking all these interesting<br/>\nquestions about Granddaddy Longlegs (eight-legged harvesters, not the<br/>\ncranefly type) and I have been having an awful time finding any info. Most<br/>\nof the library books on spiders we&#39;ve read in the last couple of years, or<br/>\nat least skimmed, and few even mention them. I checked our central library<br/>\nchildrens department, and the librarian and I ended up using an encyclopedia<br/>\nto get any info at all!:p     I don&#39;t mind, but the guys thought it kinda<br/>\ndry...<br/>\n    Does anyone have any favorite books or web-sites (or videos, or<br/>\nwhat-ever) that they could recommend??<br/>\nTIA!<br/>\nTamara<br/>\nps - please forgive me if this is a duplicate for anyone....<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I would be most happy if my children grew up to be the<br/>\nkind of people who think decorating consists of building<br/>\nenough bookshelves.&quot; -- Anna Quindlen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1560,"nextTopicId":1559}}
