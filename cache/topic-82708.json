The state laws are considered among the more restrictive.  But -- you don&#39;t have to register you child until she/he turns 8 -- which gets rid of some early performance pressure.   Each year you have to (I think) turn in objectives (which can be VERY general, i.e., continue to read books for pleasure, understand math in everyday life, etc.), in some places (though not in my school district) turn in a portfolio with examples of work, and have a certified teacher do the evaluation.  You choose the evaluator from any certified PA teacher and I&#39;m told that it is pretty easy to find a  unschooling/unschooling friendly evaluator.  I  know plenty of unschoolers in the city of Pittsburgh school district and they don&#39;t seem to be having any problems. Other school districts may vary. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe city feeling in my experience is EXTREMELY laid back.  No one cars what you drive, so far as I can tell. Housing stock is reasonably cheap for a medium sized city.  I&#39;ve had friends find move-in condition 3-4 bedroom houses in reasonable neighborhoods in the 80&#39;s and I&#39;m told even in the 60&#39;s.  My own neighborhood just saw an incredible jump in prices, but that seems to have cooled down somewhat. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really love about Pittsburgh is that as a legacy of the robber coal and steel barons (Carnegie, Frick, etc.) from the turn of the century -- it had a LOT of money put into arts/musuem/parks infrastructure, so for the size of the city, it really has better museums adn parks than it &quot;ought&quot; to have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther stuff: several universities and colleges, so good bookstores and used bookstores.  Lots of stuff to do with kids indoors and outdoors.  A reasonably active alternative parenting community.  A  terrific active, non-religious, largely-unschooling homeschooling group (and some other schoolier, christian ones). <br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure whether there is already one or more british grocery businesses -- but specialty shops like that seem to do well -- judging from the numbers of them around that stay in business. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway -- that&#39;s the long-winded answer.  I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions on or off-line if you have any. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Olga <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, October 11, 2003 10:43 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] sort of OT: great places to live/homeschool<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a question for everyone in the northeast and canada.
