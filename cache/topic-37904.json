She had <br/>\nalso been a beaten, neglected dog, and she too chased the cat. I didn&#39;t want <br/>\nher to do this, but I also didn&#39;t want her to feel even more abused. I had <br/>\nnoticed that when Darin would walk around her and talk she cowered and shook. <br/>\n(now she is his baby and *someday* they are going to get married!) I decided <br/>\nto just observe and the next time I caught her with the cat, I issued one <br/>\nsharp *NO!* and it was all over. She looked at me, ducked her head and <br/>\nwhimpered, that was it and she has never bothered the cat again. Dogs that <br/>\nhave been abused, and have kept a sweet temperament rather than turning mean <br/>\nas they usually do, can be taught with firm, gentle, loving discipline. If <br/>\nshe is as sweet and good-natured as you say, then it shouldn&#39;t take much to <br/>\ncorrect her. Good luck! I hope you get as sweet a dog as we did!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Any dog trainers out there?","postDate":"1022778949","msgId":37904,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMyMDdmZCRhZWY5NzZlMCRlODg1ZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjI3NjM3NjMuMTYwLjg0MDQyLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37912,"prevInTime":37903,"nextInTime":37905,"topicId":37904,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We tend to be the local hang out for every stray dog around.
