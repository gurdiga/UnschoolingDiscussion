I think part of what spurred it on was my mother, who was<br/>\nliving with us at the time, lost several older relatives and went back East<br/>\nfor several funerals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, a really great book for kids is _What Happens When Dinosaurs<br/>\nDie?_  It removes death by talking about it in terms of dinosaurs, but<br/>\naddresses all the different ways people die and all the questions kids might<br/>\nhave in a book/ cartoon strip format. *Beware:* it does talk about the rare<br/>\ninstances when parents die either from a violent death like a car crash or<br/>\ndisease. While this can be a frightening concept, I&#39;m guessing that kids<br/>\nhave already put two and two together and *are* worried about losing someone<br/>\nthey love even if they haven&#39;t formulated the thought very clearly yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used Em&#39;s fascination to talk about different religions and different<br/>\ncustoms. I talked about traveling to Asia--one of the most fascinating<br/>\ncultural differences were the way they buried and treated ancestors. We read<br/>\nWilliam Wordsworth&#39;s poem &quot;We are Seven&quot;, written from a little girls<br/>\nperspective back in the late 1700&#39;s about losing siblings. It&#39;s a really<br/>\nhappy, upbeat, matter-of-fact perspective--she plays with them when she<br/>\nvisits their graves--which the narrator just cannot grasp.  It&#39;s a neat way<br/>\nto explore death from a child&#39;s perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that death is just a normal fascination for children. It&#39;s a really<br/>\ntough concept to wrap their minds around. Em was so excited when my<br/>\ngrandfather died because she was going to attend his funeral. It was such an<br/>\nimportant event, and I&#39;m so glad my children were part of it. All 3 of mine<br/>\n(6, 4 and 3 at the time) attended the funeral and grave-side services, and I<br/>\nthink they really got a lot out of all of it, particularly the honor guard<br/>\nservice at the grave. I was sooo mad when dh&#39;s grandmother died and his<br/>\nmother didn&#39;t want the children to attend the services. I bit my tongue, and<br/>\nwe stayed home instead of travelling the 4.5 hours to New Jersey. I figured<br/>\nif they weren&#39;t welcome, there was no way in hell I was going to make them<br/>\nendure the drive! Argh! I just feel it&#39;s so important to treat children with<br/>\nrespect and equality, to be honest with them. (Diana&#39;s post about being<br/>\nhonest with children dealing with death rung so true! My dad died a long<br/>\ndrawn-out, cancer-like illness when I was 12, and I have never forgiven my<br/>\nmother for keeping me in the dark and shipping me off the night he died.<br/>\nThat&#39;s a whole &#39;nother post, but it explains where I&#39;m coming from with my<br/>\nown children.) Even young children gain so much by being a part of family<br/>\nrituals, including funerals. They learn about death, grief, family history,<br/>\nritual, tradition--you name it. Most of all, they learn that they are an<br/>\nimportant part of their own family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, jumping off my soapbox, now. *sheepish grin*<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Pre-K Play -- Disturbing?","postDate":"1083686308","msgId":93449,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NS4zM2Q3Y2ZlNC4yZGM5MTdhNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93445,"nextInTopic":93452,"prevInTime":93448,"nextInTime":93450,"topicId":93237,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/4/04 9:00:05 AM, jnjstau@gvtc.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-260926570\">In a message dated 5/4/04 9:00:05 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Anyway-does anyone have any suggestions on what I could say that might<br/>\n<br/>\nhelp<br/>\n<br/>\nhim cope with this?

Death is such a taboo<br/>\nin our culture and people are so afraid of death and<br/>\nall that means to people and are so reluctant to talk<br/>\nabout it maybe your daughter is picking up on the fact<br/>\nthat others are uncomfortable and so is more curious<br/>\nabout it. <br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck<br/>\nlove and peace<br/>\ndina<br/>\n--- Kimberly &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kontessa_rose@...\">kontessa_rose@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   <br/>\n&gt;   Crystal (4) and Ronnie (4) are doing more and more<br/>\n&gt; imaginitive <br/>\n&gt; play.
