You <br/>\nbet it&#39;s happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they say 1984 is a year in our distant past....<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Covert<br/>\n(KnoK NEWS)<br/>\nOsaka, Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMainichi Daily News - 18 October 2000 <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mainichi.co.jp/english/news/archive/200010/18/news02.html\">http://www.mainichi.co.jp/english/news/archive/200010/18/news02.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSCHOOL APOLOGIZES FOR HIDDEN CAMERA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMainichi Shimbun                                     <br/>\n<br/>\nKAGOSHIMA -- A public junior high school here apologized to students late <br/>\nlast month after they found that a homeroom teacher had been filming the <br/>\nstudents with a hidden camera, it was learned Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 45-year-old male teacher who set up the video camera admitted his <br/>\naction and offered an apology to the students on Sept. 27, saying, &quot;All I <br/>\nwanted was to protect a bullying victim, but I took the wrong action.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teacher hid a camera inside the speaker of a television set in his <br/>\nclassroom during the summer holidays to find out who was carrying out a <br/>\nhate campaign against a female student, Kagoshima Municipal Board of <br/>\nEducation members said. It remains unclear who organized the hate <br/>\ncampaign against the girl.                                             <br/>\n<br/>\nIdentities of the people involved and the school are being withheld for <br/>\nreasons of privacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOfficials at the Ministry of Education expressed their regret over the <br/>\nincident.                               <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Trust between students and teachers is fundamental to education. <br/>\nHowever, the fact that the teacher had installed a hidden camera shows <br/>\nthat the trust had already been lost,&quot; a ministry official said. &quot;The <br/>\nfilming was over the top. There must have been some other method.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe students discovered the camera on Sept. 27 after one of them turned <br/>\non the television in a room adjoining theirs and realized that the images <br/>\ncame from their classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school organized a meeting of the students on the same day to <br/>\napologize over the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright 2000 The Mainichi Newspapers Co.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13640,"nextTopicId":13702}}
