He&#39;s learning a lot about music and harmony that way <br/>\n(and coming up with some pretty neat tunes).  He also spends a lot of time <br/>\nreading fantasy, making creatures out of clay, and working on a 3000 piece <br/>\n3-D puzzle of Manhatten.  Dd (8 yo) has been reading a lot about history <br/>\nrecently (it started with the American Girls books and branched out from <br/>\nthere).  She also plays with the dollhouses (both hers and my old one that I <br/>\nsaved) a lot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to the library at least once a week, and I&#39;ll suggest interesting books <br/>\nthat I find.  I&#39;ll also suggest articles about science or history that I read <br/>\nin various magazines (Newsweek, National Geographic, etc.) that they might be <br/>\ninterested in.  All of these are just suggestions, however - I rarely require <br/>\nanything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;kworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lmPgEPOzB4UgQ_cVyzZ9mrE5iRzr-r2Burclc8z5lb_CuIVSmWMUPeSm_03YSOD9RsXf7jhcx4AF_5zucHqy26zZsx0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to unschooling (but not hsing)!","postDate":"959912757","msgId":8830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWJmY2MzOSRlMmU2MjkwMCRkM2E0ODAxOEBuZS5tZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDhoNmRubCtpOG5jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8828,"nextInTopic":8846,"prevInTime":8829,"nextInTime":8831,"topicId":8828,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Angela, My suggestion to you is to just live your life as you normally would, but turn as many things as possible into a learning experience.
