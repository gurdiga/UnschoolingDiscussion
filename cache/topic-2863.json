He took a sabbatical this last year and in theory was going to spend some time writing stuff. I am taking a workshop from him with my wife in October, once a week for eight weeks.  I will<br/>\nkeep you posted.  He really is absolutely fascinating and offered some of the most perceptive observations about child rearing that I have heard since I first read John Holt, Paul Goodman, Alice Miller and the like.
