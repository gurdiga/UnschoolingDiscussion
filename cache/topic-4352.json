There was a direct relationship between how much T.V. people<br/>\nwatched and how accurate they were in estimating their risks.  Of course not all<br/>\npeople, at all times but broadly over a number of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably as pernicious and destructive to our collective well-being is the &quot;junk<br/>\nfood&quot; news and &quot;educational&quot; programs which rearrange our sense of what is<br/>\nimportant in the rest of the world. Making the sensational seem really important<br/>\nand the everyday seem less important.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good example of this is the Columbine tragedy which got enormous air play and<br/>\nthe reality that 9 children die daily from gunfire in the US is muted and hardly<br/>\nmentioned at all.  If it served someone&#39;s money making agenda we would have the<br/>\n&quot;daily dead children report&quot;. Rape is another example.  A shockingly common crime<br/>\nwhich is glossed over mostly.  If it got the coverage that it really deserves<br/>\nthere would be the daily sexual assault index for every community.  It would be a<br/>\nsocial issue like drunk driving has become finally after years of unacknowledged<br/>\n(by most people) carnage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Hartley wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Pam Hartley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Date: Mon, 08 Nov 1999 05:59:13 -0800<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Joel Hawthorne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawthorne@...\">jhawthorne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Little Bear<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There&#39;s lots of time to come to grips with evil...but the shallow, cartoon,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;television fictional evil seems a lousy introduction.
