She can *tell* time--that&#39;s <br/>\nall she needs right now.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little, Kirby and Marty could tell time on a digital clock, <br/>\nbut not analog.  Holly, three years younger than Marty and five and a half <br/>\nyears younger than Kirby, came along and she could read an analog clock just <br/>\nintuitively, it seemed, almost before she could talk plain.  And so when they <br/>\nwere out and about, if there was a digital clock they would tell Holly what <br/>\ntime it was, and if it was analog, they would ask Holly and she would tell <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never worried about it because I knew they would figure both of them out <br/>\npretty easily, in their own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a game (Playroom, I think) which had a whole section involving clocks <br/>\n(both analog and digital) and they all played with that.  I had a &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>\nclock in the boys&#39; room that showed the minutes by fives, and &quot;before&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;after&quot; and &quot;quarters&quot; but they didn&#39;t care.  They just saw it as interesting <br/>\nart.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course now all of them can tell time on any clock, SET any clock or <br/>\nbrand-new watch (after they chuck the unread directions in the trash), and <br/>\ncan calculate different time zones.  It&#39;s more than many adults can do.   <br/>\n(More than I can do; when I get a new watch or alarm clock, I ask the kids to <br/>\nset it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43972,"nextTopicId":44018}}
