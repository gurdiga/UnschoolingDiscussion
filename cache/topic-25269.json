I did not realize how relaxed we<br/>\nhad become until we were around the other families.  I had always thought my<br/>\nSIL was kind of a nut, in the nicest way possible  :), because she was sooo<br/>\nconcerned about her kids, their feelings, giving them freedom.  This trip I<br/>\nwas right there with her, supporting her and vice versa, against the other<br/>\nSIL, otherwise known as the tyrant.  The difference was sooo immense.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice SIL took all the kids out on the boat skiing, letting them take turns<br/>\ndriving, no one forced to do anything, everyone allowed to do what they felt<br/>\ncomfortable doing (My 8yo parked the boat in the slip and did a better job<br/>\nthan most of the adults).<br/>\n<br/>\n Then there was the tyrant.....  The kids decided they wanted to cook supper<br/>\nfor everybody one night, talking 25 people.  So nice SIL and I took them to<br/>\nthe store to buy what they needed.  When it came time to do the cooking,<br/>\nnice SIL and I asked the kids if they wanted us to help and they declined.<br/>\nWe took some pictures and sat on the couch talking, close enough to answer<br/>\nany questions that might arise.  The tyrant walked in, gave orders, took<br/>\nover, told the kids they were wrong, then complained because the kids moved<br/>\non to do other things.  We tried to make several suggestions to the tyrant,<br/>\nlike &quot;Why don&#39;t you come over here with us?&quot;, &quot;At our house, it works better<br/>\nif the adults leave the kids to do their own projects&quot;, etc., all to no<br/>\navail.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tyrant went so far as to tell my 10yo it was time for bed, what to snack<br/>\non and when, how to fix her hair for family pictures, etc..  I repeatedly<br/>\ntold tyrant that the kids were used to making these decisions for themselves<br/>\nbut she didn&#39;t seem to even hear me.  I finally told my kids that they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be mean to their aunt, but they didn&#39;t have to mind her either.<br/>\nMade for an uncomfortable week.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25504,"nextTopicId":25527}}
