Can you be both?  Chris<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t think the two topics are related at<br/>\nall, although I see how you are linking them.  After<br/>\nyears of thought over this issue (which for personal<br/>\nreasons is very important to me) I have come to the<br/>\nconclusion that I can be neither &quot;pro-choice&quot;, nor<br/>\n&quot;pro-life&quot;.  I don&#39;t believe that this issue, being<br/>\nvery personal by nature, can be decided based on a<br/>\npolitical stance.  I believe it is a purely indiviual<br/>\nand deeply life changing decision, no matter what a<br/>\nperson decides to do in a difficult situation.  I will<br/>\nstand behind any decision a loved one makes<br/>\nthoughtfully, and be supportive to the furthest extent<br/>\nof my abilities.  I would encourage others NOT to<br/>\nabort, and do my best to help them make other options<br/>\nfeasible, but I also am in favor of the law allowing<br/>\nthe option.  I just continue to hope that few people<br/>\nchoose that road.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
