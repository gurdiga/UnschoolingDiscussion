The responses<br/>\nfrom this list will reveal both our deepest concerns about public school and<br/>\nour deepest desires for our particular alternative of<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling. I hope this list can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour relationship with your daughter is the most important consideration.<br/>\nShe needs to know, above all else, that you are on her side, that you trust<br/>\nher judgment, and want only her happiness. If she feels that she can get<br/>\nthose things from attending the school, your position becomes one of<br/>\nsupporting her decision. (not supporting her, or worse, arguing about it,<br/>\ncan be the beginning of a life-long rift between you and her. You are at a<br/>\ncrossroad now)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, her decision needs to be based on a clear evaluation of her<br/>\nexpectations. It will help you to know why she wants to return. She needs to<br/>\nbe open to telling you what those reasons are, if only to help you to accept<br/>\nher choice. That should not be too much to ask of her. It is just possible<br/>\nthat her needs are not being met by the home experience. In that case, you<br/>\nmight find that she could, after all, meet those needs with a different<br/>\n&quot;arrangement&quot; in her life at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n(she might feel that going to school offers a new type of &quot;freedom&quot; when in<br/>\nfact it is still prison. If she needs freedom, then you can probably help<br/>\nher gain more of it, without going to the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, if she does stick to her decision of going, and those reasons are not<br/>\nsatisfied by her attendance, then you can have another talk about staying or<br/>\nleaving, later. It will probably help her to know that if things do not go<br/>\nas she now hopes, she will always be free to change plans again, because the<br/>\nidea is not to finish something just because it was started, but to find the<br/>\nbest way to get where you want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41758,"nextTopicId":41784}}
