I am one of those odd people that enjoys cleaning. I really get into <br/>\nit, break a sweat, and feel so good when it&#39;s done. I think my example has <br/>\nshown my son that you can get a sense of accomplishment from just about <br/>\nanything. My house is not often *tidy*, but it is always *clean*. Last week <br/>\nI was resting on the couch (I am 9 months pregnant - due any day) and my <br/>\nson (who will be 6 in November) decided he wanted to clean the house. I got <br/>\nhim some paper towels, windex, a mop and the dustbuster. He proceeded to <br/>\nclean the whole house, giving me updates as he went from room to room. He <br/>\nwas so proud of himself. I paid him $2 - he didn&#39;t ask for any money and we <br/>\ndon&#39;t give him an allowance yet, so he was stunned. I was nervous that he <br/>\nmight start *asking* for money when doing future household activities, but <br/>\nso far he has not ever mentioned the money again, and still helps me clean <br/>\nand do dishes regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.&quot;<br/>\n-- William Butler Yeats<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon Entin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:entinfamily@...\">entinfamily@...</a><br/>\nwww.ShannonEntin.com and www.TheEntins.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99121,"nextTopicId":99140}}
