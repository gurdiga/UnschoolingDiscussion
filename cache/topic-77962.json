They would <br/>\nnot accept such poor service in any other area except with their children&#39;s <br/>\nlives.  These same people see you enjoying your children and all the time you <br/>\nspend with them and they assume that there is no way they could do that.  They <br/>\nhave been carefully conditioned to believe that it is way too hard to be a full <br/>\ntime parent educator.  And they are usually too selfish to try.<br/>\nIn my state, NY, it is hard to be an unschooler because of the stupid regs <br/>\nand requirements and reports we have to write.  So I have to be creative and I <br/>\nhave to enlist my children&#39;s help.  For them to be able to keep their freedom <br/>\nwhich they love there are minimum things they have to be able to do.  Because <br/>\nthey have to pass the stupid tests every year.  That is not too hard and they <br/>\ndo it.  <br/>\nHowever both homeschoolers and non homeschoolers alike, at least in my area <br/>\nthink of homeschooling and schooling as about the same thing.  Keeping your <br/>\nkids doing some sort of curriculum for 6 to 8 hours a day.   So simply to keep my <br/>\nchildren safe, I am a closet unschooler.  I find that once they learn to read <br/>\n and begin to understand numbers my job is to keep them supplied with the <br/>\nstuff they want to learn.  My oldest (still at home ), is 12 and he is teaching <br/>\nhimself all sorts of things on the computer about programming, about programs <br/>\nlike photoshop and illustrator.  He&#39;s making movies and writing a book.  He <br/>\nreads constantly about the stuff he is interested in and sometimes things I <br/>\nsuggest.  He is working on making clay figurines....it goes on and on.  While his <br/>\nlittle brother, who is 7, and is not reading yet,  is fascinated with the <br/>\nanimal world and just recently aquired frogs which caused us to do more research <br/>\nand opened more worlds.  We regularly visit zoos, pet stores and have just <br/>\nrecently found an animal wildlife rehabilitator to get to know.  But I know that in <br/>\nthis state, because he is not reading yet, I could have a real problem.  My <br/>\noldest who is not at home anymore did not read until he was 9.  He graduated <br/>\nfrom college.  hmm.  I don&#39;t think it was a problem.  I hate the box of <br/>\ngovernment schooling.  <br/>\nI think my littlest would be labeled with so many labels by now if he was in <br/>\nschool.  Yes, I think unschooling is about perfect.  It sets up an attitude <br/>\nthat life is full of unlimited possibilities.<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"Tim and Maureen","from":"Tim and Maureen &lt;tmthomas@...&gt;","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] MAS/DOS  WAS  Is unschooling perfect?","postDate":"1060089023","msgId":77962,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjkwMWMzNWI1MiRlZWU0NmZlMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGJnbjRpOSs5bXVnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78072,"prevInTime":77961,"nextInTime":77963,"topicId":77962,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I loved one author s take on this attitude in people - it s very ingrained in them - he called it MAS/DOS or something like that - Mad at School/Defensive of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1716559921\">I loved one author&#39;s take on this attitude in people - it&#39;s very ingrained in them - he called it MAS/DOS or something like that - &quot;Mad at School/Defensive of School.&quot;  Perfection is not the issue, but rather the 110% unwillingness to change - school is the same now as it was in 1900.

Before I begin, I thought it would be best to introduce <br/>\n  myself.  My name is Stephanie and I have two daughters, ages 3 and 6, <br/>\n  who have never been to school.  I have been lurking here for about a <br/>\n  year, and haven&#39;t ever really mustered up the nerve to post.  I read <br/>\n  a lot, when I can, and this email list has been extremely inspiring <br/>\n  and helpful to me.  So a quick &quot;thank you&quot; to all who contribute:  <br/>\n  Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, the other bit.  I have been arguing with people I don&#39;t know <br/>\n  about homeschooling, unschooling, and schooling today.  This is <br/>\n  annoying in itself, but while I was mulling it over, this thought <br/>\n  came to me:  I think it is telling that whenever people argue with me <br/>\n  about school vs. home/unschooling, they always say, &quot;I will readily <br/>\n  admit that school has it&#39;s problems, but nothing is perfect.&quot;  Yet, I <br/>\n  have never felt the need to make a similar statement about <br/>\n  unschooling (school-at-home maybe, but not unschooling).  And <br/>\n  further, I don&#39;t think that many other unschoolers would feel the <br/>\n  need to either.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But then I thought that maybe that wasn&#39;t entirely true.  Maybe other <br/>\n  unschoolers do find that unschooling has its problems, maybe even <br/>\n  ones I would agree with.  So, I decided to ask you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does unschooling have its own problems?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect, <br/>\n  but I do think it &lt;i&gt;works&lt;/i&gt;, while school does not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, there we go.  My first real post.
