I googled it and found the instructions {didn&#39;t have that kind of brush but used a boar bristle brush} and this morning I had the usual difficulties with my middle {and youngest sometimes} daughter bouncing off the walls and it helped her calm right down. I ended up doing all my kids and my hubbie &lt;g&gt; to give them the understanding of why it works, I am very sure if my middle child was in public school, they would have very much encouraged her to be on the drug.Anyway now the kids are doing each other. And again, Many Thanks :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nTracy Merritt ~ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ha-nc-tracy@...\">ha-nc-tracy@...</a> <br/>\nHA-NC Newsletter Editor <br/>\nHomeschool Alliance of North Carolina, <br/>\na different type of group, we really want <br/>\nour members to be active participants.  <br/>\nAfter all, we put the ALL in ALLiance<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ha-nc.org/\">http://www.ha-nc.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
