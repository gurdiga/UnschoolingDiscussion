Unless<br/>\nyou know or are a math whiz it is hard to teach<br/>\n&quot;unschooled&quot;  Forget those public school gifted<br/>\nclasses, all they did was give the kids  more work to<br/>\ndo (keep them busy so they did not disrupt the class).<br/>\nMath  is one of the main reasons i am home schooling.<br/>\nHaving a future  Neurosurgeon who is doing 7th grade<br/>\nmath instead of 5th and a future  Architec who is doing<br/>\n9th grade Algebra instead of 7th (they both  probably<br/>\nwould be farther but i can&#39;t keep up!)I know<br/>\nunschoolers hate  to hear it but i am going to suggest<br/>\na curriculum that lets the child learn  from basic on<br/>\nup. It is called Saxon Math (their home school<br/>\nversion)  You can go on line print up the test, give it<br/>\nto Derek and find out where  you need to start him off.<br/>\nIt has a lot of repetition, that is so the kids  learn<br/>\n&quot;sight answers&quot; (knowing multiplication, adding,<br/>\nsubtracting,  common fractions and square roots just<br/>\noff the top of their head) This is  important for the<br/>\nchild that is going to go into advance math with  some<br/>\nformulas that take 3 hours to do and 20 pages of paper<br/>\n(it sure  makes the problem a lot easier if they don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to stress on the little  stuff {and saves a lot of<br/>\ntime}). Again this is for the unschooler who will  need<br/>\nto know math for their future goals. I am not<br/>\nsuggesting this for  unschoolers who feel this does not<br/>\nfit into their methods. I hope i was of  some help.<br/>\nSandra B.<br/>\n---&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nlouise  wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This email may get long-winded, but I&#39;m needing to<br/>\n&gt;  inquire with other unschoolers about a snag our<br/>\n&gt; family has hit  recently.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our son, Derek, unschools.  Sometimes he just  floats<br/>\n&gt; around indulging in whatever hits his fancy, other<br/>\n&gt;  times he has come to us with a list of topics he<br/>\n&gt; wants to learn about,  and asks for help. So far, the<br/>\n&gt; things he wants to learn about have  been fun to come<br/>\n&gt; up with resources and ideas for him to explore.   For<br/>\n&gt; example, he wants to learn about other countries. <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s  asked me to give him something to do so he can<br/>\n&gt; learn, so I put  together a &quot;backpacking through<br/>\n&gt; Europe&quot; idea for him.  There&#39;s  not much to it, other<br/>\n&gt; than he started off with Italy and is now in  France.<br/>\n&gt;  We jot down a slew of questions about the  country<br/>\n&gt; and he goes and researches the answers.  Some of  the<br/>\n&gt; questions lead him to learning about scientists and<br/>\n&gt;  inventors from those countries that invented or<br/>\n&gt; discovered things that  wow and amaze Derek, so he<br/>\n&gt; starts researching those topics as  well.  When Derek<br/>\n&gt; feels he&#39;s learned a lot about the country, he  then<br/>\n&gt; puts together a menu of authentic cuisine from that<br/>\n&gt;  country, sends out a fancy invitation to us and his<br/>\n&gt; grandmother and  her friend to attend the dinner, and<br/>\n&gt; he then cooks a four course  dinner for us of<br/>\n&gt; authentic cuisine and teaches us about the country.  <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s an amazing chef so we are spoiled with a<br/>\n&gt; wonderful  dinner.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, it&#39;s not really a formal study or program  or<br/>\n&gt; anything, it&#39;s just something fun that he enjoys and<br/>\n&gt; has  asked us to continue doing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Derek&#39;s big passion is studying  electronics.  He&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; off on his own with this, using electronic  kits,<br/>\n&gt; books, and collecting bits and pieces from broken<br/>\n&gt;  appliances and gadgets and turning them into<br/>\n&gt; electronic toys.   Last night he demonstrated an<br/>\n&gt; airboat he built from bits and  parts.  His mission<br/>\n&gt; is to be the first person to build an  electric<br/>\n&gt; plane.  He brought in a diagram he drew of his<br/>\n&gt;  design, and it&#39;s very impressive (this coming from<br/>\n&gt; me, who knows  nothing about electronics).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, now my dilemna.  Derek  has reached a point in<br/>\n&gt; his electronics where he really needs to know  his<br/>\n&gt; math. He asks his father, Graham, questions now that<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t  be answered until Derek understands advanced<br/>\n&gt; math.  Derek was in  gifted math & science classes<br/>\n&gt; when he was in public school, but  after unschooling<br/>\n&gt; for 1 1/2 years, he barely remembers what  2+2<br/>\n&gt; equals.  This may seem like a knock against<br/>\n&gt;  unschooling, but I see it as a knock against the<br/>\n&gt; public schools method  of teaching math.  If he truly<br/>\n&gt; had learned what they taught (and  he brought home<br/>\n&gt; those A++&#39;s all the time), then he would remember  it<br/>\n&gt; 1 1/2 years later.  What Derek needs is applied<br/>\n&gt;  learning.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, the kind of math he needs right now  isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; going to be gained quickly from his cooking, or<br/>\n&gt; building  a playhouse, and playing his math computer<br/>\n&gt; games.  He&#39;s learning  from those experiences, but<br/>\n&gt; for his electronics he&#39;s needing to learn  to some<br/>\n&gt; degree of algebraic formulas.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He told  us last night that he wants to learn this<br/>\n&gt; math. He&#39;s anxious to get  past the roadblock he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; hit with electronics.  He&#39;s ready to  start building<br/>\n&gt; that electric plane.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have  ANY advice on how we can help Derek<br/>\n&gt; achieve this?  I know nothing  about fancy math<br/>\n&gt; formula&#39;s.  Graham has the knowledge, but not  the<br/>\n&gt; know how of sitting a child down and teaching them<br/>\n&gt;  math.  Plus, Derek has to go back to the basic<br/>\n&gt; building blocks  he&#39;s missed out on.  He has a gifted<br/>\n&gt; mathematical mind to  understand it all rather<br/>\n&gt; quickly, but I haven&#39;t a clue of where to  point<br/>\n&gt; Derek to on this one.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would like to  have several ideas of how Derek can<br/>\n&gt; learn this advanced math, building  up from the<br/>\n&gt; basics, and present them to Derek so he can let us<br/>\n&gt;  know what would work best for him.  He&#39;s passionate<br/>\n&gt; about wanting  to learn the math he needs for his<br/>\n&gt; electronics and I want to provide  him with some<br/>\n&gt; outlets.  I need some ideas though.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any advice/ideas they can share?  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Louise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104200,"nextTopicId":104207}}
