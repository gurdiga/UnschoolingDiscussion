But it is so nice <br/>\nto know the group is here ...as if I might click on the link one day <br/>\nand it would all be gone ;)  My only support for unschooling right <br/>\nnow is this group...lots of homeschoolers in Okinawa...not <br/>\nunschoolers.  Anyway, my intentions of this post...I read and <br/>\narticle in HEM about placemats and it made me laugh because I <br/>\nsuddenly remembered all those great plastic placemats I had as a kid <br/>\nand have never thought of them for mine.  I found a site with the <br/>\ncomedic name painless learning and ordered a bunch of different <br/>\nplacemats.  I know we will probably use them for anything but <br/>\nplacemats!  I just thought it was a neat way to explore.  I know my <br/>\nkids will love them ...for everything.  Does anyone else use them?  <br/>\nAnd not for keeping the table clean?  We are all hanging in here <br/>\nwith the unschooling.  Some days it is difficult because as so many <br/>\nhave said before it feels like we didn&#39;t do anything...but a closer <br/>\nlook at our day and I know it isn&#39;t true.  I sent in a letter to the <br/>\nschool denying services and most it, past the first sentence, was my <br/>\nfeelings on the way I was received at the IEP meeting.  No comment <br/>\nfrom the principal...although I ran into one of the members of the <br/>\nteam and she apologized over and over about the miscommunication.  I <br/>\nsaid that telling me a once per week visit to the school for spec. <br/>\nservices would be babysitting was a clear message.  She just <br/>\nmentioned that the principal did use poor choice of words and can be <br/>\ntoo blunt at times...on and on.  The worst thing I keep coming up <br/>\nagainst with people is the socializatin thing.  I&#39;m not asking for <br/>\nanyone&#39;s opinions here yet they seem to keep giving them to me as <br/>\nsoon as they hear I homeschool.  It starts by them asking my <br/>\nchildren where they go to school and then it starts...it is usually <br/>\nsomething like &quot;well as long as they are getting enough <br/>\nsocialization then...I guess it is good.&quot;  Ugghhh!  I didn&#39;t ask.  <br/>\nOne parent debated with me how her child&#39;s teacher told her that <br/>\nhsing was not good because kids are not socialized enough...yet they <br/>\ncan&#39;t give you an example of interaction with a hsed kid who showed <br/>\nsigns of social ineptness!  Ok - I&#39;ll stop rambling...I&#39;ve just not <br/>\nposted in so long and it is nice to rant every now and then.  <br/>\nMichelle B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50179,"nextTopicId":50171}}
