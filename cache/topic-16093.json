A homeschooling friend \n<br>of his decided to go to school after the holiday break, so I knew where the \n<br>idea came from. We went to look at the public school nearby. He left saying \n<br>that he thought he would like to go. Fortunately, we have a homeschooling \n<br>theater group in our area, and my son was very interested in being in the \n<br>next play. Auditions were the day after we looked at the school, so my son \n<br>said he wanted to audition first and then he would decide. He got a part in \n<br>the play, and decided that he wanted to be in the play more. (good timing!) \n<br>It was extremely hard for me to take him to look at the school. However, \n<br>knowing my son, if I hadn&#39;t allowed him to decide, I would have never heard \n<br>the end of it. If he had decided to attend the school, I would have let him \n<br>go. I know alot of homeschooled children who go to school one year, stay home \n<br>the next. I think it is important to listen to our kids. If I hadn&#39;t given \n<br>control of this decision to my son, we would probably still be talking about \n<br>it.\n<br>\n<br>Wendy\n<br>In a message dated 2/7/01 3:05:48 PM Central Standard Time, \n<br>Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes:\n<br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\" style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;\">My 8 year old has been asking to go to school a lot lately. &nbsp;</blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16050,"nextTopicId":16095}}
