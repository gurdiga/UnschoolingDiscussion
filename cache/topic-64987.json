My 6 yr old Catherine only refers to him as dad because her sister does. Catherine was 1 when I left, she always screamed when he came to pick them up. They spend more time with their stepmom then with him on their weekends and I have suggested ending visitation since they seem to be an &quot;inconvienence&quot; for them. ~Money seems to be an issue also. He feels he should &quot;get his money worth&quot; so to speak. Which is funny because he owes over $8000 in child support. Since paying support is such a thorn in his side and he does not try to contact them in any other way except scheduled visits, I suggested that he sign over his rights and we could wipe the slate clean. Meaning we could forget what he owes the girls and never have to pay child support again. I would still allow visits but it would be on the girls terms. Suprisingly he said no. I feel this is a power he needs. He is a very controling person. ~He has asked the girls if this is something they want and of course that puts them on the spot and they say no. I think Alicyn fears him silently. Deep down she remembers things I wish we could all forget. She also feels torn. She feels responsible for his happiness. I have talked to her about this. This was also my problem as well for years. I thought if I did everything just right he would &quot;see the light&quot; and become a happier person. Give him the &quot;family&quot; he never had. ~What I have learned is that you are responsible for your own happiness. You have a choice, you can be happy or be sad. And that people will treat you the way you allow them to treat you. It took me years to gain back what &quot;I allowed&quot; him to take from me. He is who he his &amp; only he can change that, I don&#39;t have to sink with him. She has a hard time opening up to David because she feels obligated to love her father. And that loving David is a betrayal to her father. He makes her feel bad about that. We have had many talks about this, now that she is gettting older she is starting to talk and understand things more. We never speak down about her father. As she gets older she will see him for what he is and she can make her own judgements. ~I feel frustrated that she might drain herself fighting for his love and approval just as I did. I want her to learn from my mistakes before it&#39;s too late. She is too young to have to go through these things.~Thank you for your kind words and encouragement.  It does give me that light at the end of the tunnel to know that you were able to find that connection with him. In the end he is and always will be her &quot;father&quot;. Biological anyway, I feel it is important that she retain some sort of connection.Thank you, Rebecca!~Annie~~You may laugh at me because I am different.

Children are confused and hurt by unsupporting parent~long~Oh Annie, my heart goes out to you. I wish that I had a magis solution for you. I would consider giving your girls the choice to go or not. I had some similar problems with my dad when I was younger and had to remove myself from a relationship with him until I was ready for it, it took years but when I was able to approach him on my own terms and be treated as an equal we were able to have a good relationship.{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{hugs}}}}}}}}}}}}}}} RebeccaYahoo!

If bio-dad was hitting them, would you question whether or not your daughters would be there?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I agree that visitation is a right, like any right, it should not be abused. (again - that word)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bio-dads behavior & that of wife #2 are counter productive to raising healthy women. They, (bio dad & wife #2) are in fact, raising victims.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you and the courts allow this to go on, then the message is, if someone says I love you or if someone has a legal right to you - that person can treat you any way he wants. This is a very important point that I would not allow to be lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nkeep a detailed journal - both in writing and video tape. Ask your daughters if they would mind doing the same. Here, in our home, Brianna & I keep a journal, but we also write down the bad things that happen, sort of in  letter form - that way we can &quot;give them up&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you could speak to an attorney - I&#39;m sure that you are not about raising future victims - believe me - I&#39;ve used that argument against the Dept of Children, Youth & Families here in RI. I kept Brianna from her bio-mom for well over a year. I arranged it that I would be the judge of when Brianna&#39;s bio-mom could have a visit with Brianna. I addressed the court, myself.  Brianna&#39;s total visitation &#39;attitude&#39; was changed. To this day, Brianna sees her mom when I say it&#39;s okay (which means - when Brianna wants to) It wasn&#39;t easy.

My two oldest children <br/>\n  have visitation every other weekend. Thankfully it is only 4 days a <br/>\n  month. (You will understand why I am thankful when read the situation)<br/>\n  Extremely long story short, my ex is not supportive of my decision to <br/>\n  unschool or homeschooling. (We began with homeschooling and found <br/>\n  unschooling to fit us like a glove..:P )I gave him several books on <br/>\n  the subject to help him understand more about it. It appears that he <br/>\n  has not read even one page.<br/>\n  My girls came back from their visit very drained and depressed <br/>\n  (..AGAIN) I am thankful that they feel comfortable enough these days <br/>\n  to speak with me about what has been going on. I was shocked. My <br/>\n  children are now questioning everything about themselves.<br/>\n  They went on a fishing trip with their dad and stepmom. They were <br/>\n  having a fishing contest, who could the most..etc.(Teams:Alicyn (10) <br/>\n  and Catherine (6) plus her dad against his wife and her 8yr old boy) <br/>\n  Alicyn jokingly made a comment to her stepmom that catching the same <br/>\n  little fish 3 times in a row should only count as one. Her stepmom <br/>\n  looked at her and told her she was too stupid to count and needed to <br/>\n  go back to school. 3 is 3 not 1. I was floored. Alicyn also wanted to <br/>\n  participate in school sports and such. When she started to talk about <br/>\n  cheerleading and volleyball they told her she had to be in Real <br/>\n  School. And that she &quot;would miss out on everything even college <br/>\n  because her mother is too stupid and lazy to send her to a real <br/>\n  school&quot;. My daughter is in tears thinking she can not go to college <br/>\n  and such, despite all of the &quot;success stories&quot; we have been reading. <br/>\n  When we moved she had a terrible time in school and it was her choice <br/>\n  to leave, the thought of going back brings her to tears. Her father <br/>\n  is causing her great emotional pain. While talking Catherine broke <br/>\n  into tears with what she goes though there. They do not allow her to <br/>\n  make her own breakfast or get her own drink. She is frequently being <br/>\n  left out of everything. I wish I could keep them from going but <br/>\n  visitation is a right I can not take away. I have told them to keep <br/>\n  me informed of what is going on and keep a journal of the events. I <br/>\n  have also told them to just say okay and let it go, because if they <br/>\n  try to speak to them about it, the situation just gets worse for <br/>\n  them. <br/>\n  What can I do?! Does anyone know any books that would be helpful that <br/>\n  my daughter could read? Maybe written by other unschoolers?<br/>\n  I am upset because it has taken a lot to get their confidence and <br/>\n  self esteem back up since we left school. I feel as if he is doing to <br/>\n  them what he did to me. He takes a piece of you everytime until you <br/>\n  wake up one day and your gone. I remember what it was like and I will <br/>\n  not let me distroy them. My fiance and I have even talked about <br/>\n  moving across the US to Arizona. Something we have always talked <br/>\n  about doing, he would be out of the picture and I feel it could be <br/>\n  the best for everyone. But then I would feel like I was running away. <br/>\n  Please help, I feel as though I am loosing the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry for the length<br/>\n  ~Annie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!
