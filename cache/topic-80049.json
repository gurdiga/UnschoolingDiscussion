They not only have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1640044114\">On a whim I just looked up the IFYE Program for travel to Japan that <br/>\nis sponsored by Ohio State&#39;s 4-H International Opportunities <br/>\nprogram.  They not only have a wide variety of programs available for <br/>\ntravel to Japan, but at about half the cost of the Student Ambassador <br/>\nProgram.  And in Ohio you do not have to be a 4-H club member to take <br/>\npart in these programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the web site for the Ohio program:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ohioline.osu.edu/4-H/fguide00/4h_29.html\">http://ohioline.osu.edu/4-H/fguide00/4h_29.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is the link for the larger organization, IFYE and all its <br/>\ndifferent programs:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ifyeusa.org/home.html\">http://www.ifyeusa.org/home.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the YFU (Youth For Understanding) exchange <br/>\nprograms:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yfu-usa.org/\">http://www.yfu-usa.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTheir prices are high too, I think, but they are for a summer, or a <br/>\nsemester, or an academic year, or a full year, not just three weeks.  <br/>\nAnd they have been around a long time, too.  Their exchange programs <br/>\nare with many different nations, not just English speaking ones for a <br/>\nreal opportunity to experience a different culture. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe AFS is another program that has been around forever and that has <br/>\nmany different programs in dozens of different countries.  Prices are <br/>\nsteep, but comparable to YFU&#39;s prices, and for longer time periods <br/>\nthan the Student Ambassador Programs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last, but not least, many churches, religious organizations, and <br/>\nother youth groups sponsor foreign travel opportunities for youth.  <br/>\nThese can be for various purposes.  Some are religious and some are <br/>\ncommunity service type trips, and some are strictly educational.  But <br/>\nany of these would be worth investigating.  Local universities often <br/>\nhave well-organized trips, too, with college credit.  I mean, if <br/>\nyou&#39;re going to spend the big bucks up front you might as well go for <br/>\nthe college credit, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some other groups to check out:  American Youth Hostels, The <br/>\nFriendship Force, Amnesty International, the Sierra Club, American <br/>\nFriends Service Committee, Planned Parenthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the die-hard unschooler, like my daughter, will probably prefer <br/>\nto do-it-herself, planning her own trip and staying where she wants <br/>\nto stay.  She will use Servas, hostels and a couple other travel <br/>\nnetworks we belong to through organizations to link up with hosts in <br/>\ndifferent countries.   These kinds of groups cut the costs down to <br/>\nhalf or less what the more organized programs cost, allow for much <br/>\nmore freedom to decide where you want to go, what you want to see, <br/>\nand when, and the flexibility to change things if the weather or <br/>\npolitical circumstances change suddenly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usservas.org/\">http://www.usservas.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] People to People Student Ambassador Program?????","postDate":"1063207685","msgId":80169,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhOS4xOWM1NTQ0ZS4yYzkwOWQwNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":80139,"nextInTopic":80215,"prevInTime":80168,"nextInTime":80170,"topicId":80049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/8/2003 9:03:04 AM Eastern Daylight Time, tessimal@yahoo.com writes: This has me very curious.
