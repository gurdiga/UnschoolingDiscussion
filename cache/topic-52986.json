I know my daughter would have LOVED to have been a Mommys <br/>\nhelper when she was 7.. Actually, she was..lol. She was my helper.. and also <br/>\nmy sisters&#39;  We all had babies within 6mos of each other when Anna was <br/>\n5-51/2.. She still babysits for her neices and nephews.. Now she can do it <br/>\nalone and into the late night.   OK.. ( sorry for getting on a tangent <br/>\nthere..)..   I was going to offer some other suggestions.  I dont know your <br/>\nfamily situation, but my kids have always &quot;worked&quot; for thier grandparents.   <br/>\nGrandma and Grandpa would ( and still do) give them little jobs to do for <br/>\nthem.  They felt so proud to be &quot;working&quot; and also to make a little $$.. It <br/>\nwas more than an allowance from Mom and Dad , it was more like a job.   If <br/>\nyour parents are not available or willing to do this, how about a neighbor or <br/>\nchurch member, or other family member?.   They would give them jobs like <br/>\nsweeping the porch , helping in the garden, washing the car, house cleaning,  <br/>\norganizing the desk.. all kinds of things.   My dad is a farmer so there is <br/>\nalways an abundance of little chores for the kids to do that he is glad to <br/>\nhave someone do ( you know.. the dirty work.. lol)..  I think when kids show <br/>\ninterest in working and earning money, its a good thing to encourage.  <br/>\nChildren really learn respect for money and material things when they earn <br/>\nand spend thier own money<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] 7 year old wants to work","postDate":"1041645714","msgId":52999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFiZC4xOWY4OGY1Mi4yYjQ3OWE5MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52998,"nextInTopic":53013,"prevInTime":52998,"nextInTime":53000,"topicId":52986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh!
