Each of my children is so different and constantly let me know just how different they are.   Even as toddlers one needed more routine  and solitude in her day in order to be a happy content person.  The other child has always been very happy when surrounded by people and in the middle of  what the other one would have considered chaos. If you pay attention to what works with each child you can figure out each of their educational needs.  I don&#39;t know how old your kids are, but mine have never hesitated to tell me what they need and what I am doing wrong and now that they are teens......well, it seems I do nothing right!!  I am much more structured and routine oriented than hubby or a couple of the kids, it drives<br/>\n&gt; them crazy.  But, their haphazard way of approaching projects and laid back approach to completing them drive the rest of us crazy.
