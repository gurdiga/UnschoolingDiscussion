The comparing-herself-to-Mary thing is actually much stronger in the TV series","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1479425865\">My kids have actually been watching the Michael Landon series, not the new<br/>\none. The comparing-herself-to-Mary thing is actually much stronger in the TV<br/>\nseries than in the books. It seems largely a color-of-hair issue -- I also<br/>\nsee it as something very much internally driven. When adults are brought<br/>\ninto the issue in the book, they talk about liking brown hair just as much.<br/>\nI do think that Mary fit in better to the late 1800s version of what a young<br/>\nwoman should be like -- quiet and self-effacing and a hard, patient worker<br/>\n-- Laura was livelier. I would suspect there was some shaming behavior<br/>\nhappening outside the pages of the book, but I also see in my own children,<br/>\nesp. the close-in-age girls, that they compare each other without my<br/>\nassistance! For instance, the 7yo has noticed that the 3yo&#39;s hair grows much<br/>\nlonger and thicker than her own -- and also that the 3yo&#39;s hair seems to be<br/>\ndarkening much faster than her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I have read a lot about the Ingalls family history because I loved the<br/>\nbooks when I was a child, and it&#39;s interesting to note that by most people&#39;s<br/>\nstandards, Laura was very pretty while Mary was plain. One biography talks<br/>\nabout how shocked Ma had been when Pa had wanted her for a wife since he was<br/>\nconsidered a handsome &quot;catch&quot; and she was not.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Landon show can show a lot of nastiness between Nellie Oleson and Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did the new show include the scene from the book where Pa beats Laura with a<br/>\n&gt; belt? Does the show include the endless misery that Laura feels all through<br/>\n&gt; her childhood from constantly being compared to Mary, her lack of self<br/>\n&gt; esteem and belief in her own &quot;badness&quot;? Did they show Ma&#39;s rigidity and<br/>\n&gt; controlling nature - not to mention racism? What a shock I got when I read<br/>\n&gt; the whole series (that I picked up from a vendor last year&#39;s Conference at a<br/>\n&gt; great bargain) since it had always been touted as a &quot;wonderful&quot; example of<br/>\n&gt; parenting and home schooling. Maybe *in comparison* to the standards of the<br/>\n&gt; time. I consider those books to be historical documents giving interesting<br/>\n&gt; information about how people lived, and the unremitting physical labor they<br/>\n&gt; undertook, but as a treatise on gentle parenting (as I had been told) - no.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it definitely would be shocking if you were expecting contemporary<br/>\n&quot;gentle parenting.&quot; My guess is that the family life is rather sweet and<br/>\ngentle -- for the 1870s and 1880s or even the first have of the 20th century<br/>\nwhen the books came out. It&#39;s also scary, though, to think about how<br/>\ncontemporary parents who see this family as gentle are treating their own<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe racism aspect in the books was something my 9yo and I have discussed<br/>\nfrom a historical perspective as well as regarding what it means in the<br/>\ncontext of how we are to view Ma. Ma is no model of perfection, and that<br/>\nboth works with his experience with his own parents and is something we talk<br/>\nabout with regard to other people. We don&#39;t have to like everything someone<br/>\ndoes to like them as people or to love them as family members. Ma definitely<br/>\nisn&#39;t perfectly virtuous, esp. by contemporary standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
