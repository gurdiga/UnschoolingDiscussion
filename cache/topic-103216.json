I have been having issues with my guys really being mean, unkind or manipulative with one another. Yelling at one another, or name calling, really irks me. I feel liek I have talked and talked about this with them - and nothing changes. I know my husband and I are not name calling and such. I find that I am called upon to be the referee at times between squabbles. Perhaps it is not the absence of meaness from me - but rather the lack of pure genorosity. In fact often I feel that we have done so much and it is so often unappreciated. Maybe looking for any appreciation is the thing I am doing wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger daughter got a gift card for her birthday(she&#39;s 6) and we all went to Walmart. My older daughter and son had their own money and only my son brought his. So my daughter wanted a candy and then realized she forgot her money. The younger one quickly said &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll buy it for you.&quot; I said that was really nice and maybe B could pay her back when we got home. So my younger one says &quot;No that she would just buy it&quot;. Not 5 minutes after we are home - my older one is shrieking at the little one to get out of her room. Apparently, Lexi brought in some of her new games to play and then argued about who would be which piece, which developed into an argument, etc. I just don&#39;t get it. I used to think that these were sibling issues, and of course children have many issues that we as adults have, just haven&#39;t figured out a more acceptable way of dealing with them, <br/>\n<br/>\nI just hope I am doing this right - and modeling the proper behaviors. Sometimes, when I feel like I am giving generously, they are simply taking and not getting the idea that this is the way I would like them to treat one another. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157270430,"authorName":"Barbara Chase","from":"Barbara Chase &lt;barb@...&gt;","profile":"bc_avn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Generously Understanding","postDate":"1107921895","msgId":103239,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNjExMDQ3MGJlMmYzYzYxNDkxZEBbMjA0LjE4OS4xMS40MV0+"},"prevInTopic":103228,"nextInTopic":104239,"prevInTime":103238,"nextInTime":103240,"topicId":103216,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I was washing dishes and pondering in my brain that no matter how often I wash dishes there are always more dishes to wash.  I&#39;m feeling some pressure from dh about the house being messy and have some other things going on and was feeling overwhelmed.  It seems that so much of keeping a house is only noticed when it isn&#39;t done.  Out loud I said, &quot;How can people tell if a house is well kept?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJackie (9) said, &quot;When the people are happy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat made me feel very good and I told her so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I noticed lately is my reaction when my husband points out something that needs to be done.  I periodically haul the recycling stuff to be recycled.  In between times it piles up in a corner of the garage.  The piles have gotten pretty big due to holidays and cold weather.  Several times in the last month he has made a comment about the recycling needing to be done.  I&#39;ve simply said, &quot;yes, it does.&quot;  Never mind that he is capable of doing it if it bothers him that much.  His pointing it out did NOT result in my rushing to do it asap.  And, it made me feel bad!  I certainly can see with my own eyes that it needs to be done.  I&#39;ve just been busy with other things and don&#39;t see it as a highest priority item.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really gave me an aha moment of how my kids must feel if I make comments about their stuff.  Surely they know when there are more clothes on the floor than in their drawers or toys scattered all over.  It is much better if I can simply help pick it up when it gets to be too much for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Generously Understanding","postDate":"1107914287","msgId":103218,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDMDhDMzZGLjQ4RTJDRDY0LjBDOEQ0NUE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103216,"nextInTopic":103228,"prevInTime":103217,"nextInTime":103219,"topicId":103216,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I feel that we have done so much and it is so often unappreciated.
