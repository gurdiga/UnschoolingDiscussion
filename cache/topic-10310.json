I am not here to agree or disagree with anyone.<br>&gt; \n  &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am here to say that even though I have been quite tolerant \n  and patient<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; &gt; these emails filling my inbox these last \n  few days, it&#39;s a bit tiring<br>&gt; seeing<br>&gt; &gt; some really judgmental \n  and quite rude statements. Everybody does things<br>&gt; &gt; differently, and \n  what works for some doesn&#39;t work for all. I can<br>&gt; understand<br>&gt; \n  &gt; soapboxes, and how people feel very passionately about certain \n  things.<br>But<br>&gt; &gt; all of the rudeness has gotten to the point that \n  it&#39;s embarrassing to<br>&gt; think<br>&gt; &gt; that anyone would visit this \n  list to subscribe and see so much harshness<br>&gt; and<br>&gt; &gt; downright \n  meanness. It&#39;s one thing to make room for other&#39;s views and<br>also<br>&gt; \n  &gt; to disagree with them. It&#39;s another to be so intolerant and rude. \n  I&#39;m<br>&gt; weary<br>&gt; &gt; of all of this, and yes Dia, I have given you \n  some attention that you<br>seem<br>&gt; &gt; to be needy of by directing this \n  email toward you, as it&#39;s mainly your<br>&gt; &gt; defensive, aggressive, \n  condescension that I am addressing.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Now, I&#39;m sure \n  this email won&#39;t make a bit of difference to some, but<br>there<br>&gt; &gt; \n  are so many other topics that we can introduce rather then allowing \n  some<br>&gt; of<br>&gt; &gt; this rudeness to continue.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; \n  &gt; Dia, could you possibly reply to someone&#39;s email without dissecting \n  it<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; flaming them? (and if you want to copy and paste this \n  into an email with<br>&gt; &gt; excerpts from other emails that you have \n  replied to without flaming<br>&gt; someone,<br>&gt; &gt; feel free).<br>&gt; \n  &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Much love to all,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Brynn<br>&gt; \n  &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; -----Original \n  Message-----<br>&gt; &gt; From: Dia Garland [<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moocow@...\">mailto:moocow@...</a>]<br>&gt; &gt; Sent: \n  Wednesday, June 28, 2000 8:19 PM<br>&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br>&gt; \n  &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] abuse<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; \n  &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; Anytime you physically touch someone without \n  their<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permission, it could be constituted as \n  abuse&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.&nbsp; Accidental contact is \n  one thing and that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; is not what I was talking \n  about.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; These are two different \n  statements.&nbsp; The first is what I was replying<br>to.<br>&gt; &gt; You \n  said &quot;anytime&quot;.&nbsp; On another list I probably would have realized \n  that<br>&gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; writer was exaggerating somewhat, here I just \n  don&#39;t know.&nbsp; It&#39;s like<br>&gt; jumping<br>&gt; &gt; into a group of \n  pirahnas.&nbsp; I am very glad that you don&#39;t scream &quot;abuse&quot;<br>if<br>&gt; \n  &gt; someone bumps you in line.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spanking \n  is intentionally hurting someone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a way that is not \n  acceptable. &lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; It may not be acceptable in \n  your opinion, that does not mean that it is<br>&gt; not<br>&gt; &gt; \n  acceptable to everyone.&nbsp; Your opinion is not the only one in \n  existence.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; You are humiliating your child any \n  time you lay a hand on them.&nbsp; Trust<br>&gt; me,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve \n  been one of those children.&lt;&lt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I am not \n  humiliating my child, I am correcting my child.&nbsp; I was \n  beaten<br>as<br>&gt; a<br>&gt; &gt; child, and I know full well the difference \n  between beating and spanking.<br>&gt; &gt; No, I don&#39;t trust you.&nbsp; Not \n  even a little bit.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt; \n  0% Introductory APR!<br>&gt; Instant Approval!<br>&gt; Aria Visa - get yours \n  today.<br>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6035/14/_/448294/_/962292792/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6035/14/_/448294/_/962292792/</a><br>&gt; \n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>&gt; Check it \n  all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  To Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br></font></div></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10248,"nextTopicId":10314}}
