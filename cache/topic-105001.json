Years ago, when I was first married and only 19, I taught <br/>\nkindrgarten at an unaccredited Christian school in CA.  I had absolutely no <br/>\nguidance from the principal or other teachers, so I did everything my own <br/>\nway, making it up as I went along.  One of the things I did was make up <br/>\nsongs to help the children (I had 13 in the group) learn things like days of <br/>\nthe week or months of the year.  I usually just used familiar tunes because <br/>\nI&#39;m only semi-musical (love it but not talented).<br/>\n<br/>\nI never realized what tune I (almost )used for days of the week until now! <br/>\n(A few notes are off, but very similar).  But I only sing it through two <br/>\ntimes, like a verse.  I love it with the chorus included.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105000,"nextTopicId":97655}}
