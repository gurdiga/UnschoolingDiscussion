LOL.  Seriously, this is a great site, and leads to so much <br/>\nmore.  My oldest is into computer stuff, knows way more then me.  We just <br/>\nfound a person who recycles old printers and puters, rebuilds them and such, <br/>\nhe is going to teach the boys how to build a computer.  They are very <br/>\nexcited, the oldest for sure, the youngest is just doing whatever his brother <br/>\ndoes!  Right now I am trying to find sites that would teach how to use spread <br/>\nsheets and make graphs.  There is a project on the site you sent, where they <br/>\nhave to do that, and I don&#39;t know how, so need some tech sites that teach <br/>\nthis, anyone know of any such thing?<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"D Klement","from":"D Klement &lt;klement@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"DzAJ_eG9sPw8yH44SC2NJbuhimNTQEWAZ-97nY1x4lQSQ-7F5fR324VUy21l5oz7YP1VbR3KX9B0kCN387JGcxDuV_KCkZXW","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Something to look at","postDate":"951490804","msgId":6770,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MzMuNjc3MC45NTkyNjk3NDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6773,"prevInTime":6769,"nextInTime":6771,"topicId":6770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Got this in my e-mail today from Learning Kingdom. thought it might be worth a look.
