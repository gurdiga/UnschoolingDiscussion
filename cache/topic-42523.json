I read on a blog yesterday as good an<br/>\nexplanation as is likely to be found.  Given that Blogspot&#39;s<br/>\nperma links are notoriously unstable, I have cut and pasted the<br/>\nwhole thing, followed by the &quot;perma link&quot; below - tedious going<br/>\nunless you are really interested, but as a Catholic I am, LOL:<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling and Canon Law<br/>\n<br/>\nI got another email today inquiring about homeschooling, canon<br/>\nlaw, diocesan guidelines, the rights of parents, and the ongoing<br/>\nfeud between CHSNA and NACHE/TORCH. Originally, I stayed out of<br/>\nthis debate since I know people on both sides and I also know how<br/>\nemotional and intense these debates can become. Also, my position<br/>\nfell somewhere in the middle of that advocated by each group, and<br/>\nso neither side would have been satisfied with my response. For<br/>\nthe past two years I continued to receive one or two emails or<br/>\nphone calls a week from average homeschooling parents who are<br/>\nconfused about all the issues involved. As much as I would like<br/>\nto stay out of it and allow the two groups to work out their own<br/>\nproblems, now that children are being denied the sacraments I<br/>\nfeel I must state something. So I finally sat down, put<br/>\neverything into writing, and emailed CHSNA and NACHE the results.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if either group will respond, but if any of my<br/>\nreaders are part of a homeschooling group, please feel free to<br/>\nreproduce and distribute the following. All I ask is that you if<br/>\nyou reprint it in your newsletter, please send me a copy. My<br/>\naddress is over in the column to the right side.....<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling Guidelines and<br/>\nSacramental Preparation<br/>\n<br/>\nPete Vere, JCL<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is with a fair amount of trepidation that I wander into this<br/>\ndebate. As both a licensed canonist and a student currently<br/>\nworking towards a Pontifical Diploma in Catechesis, I understand<br/>\nthe need for diocesan guidelines with regards to homeschooling<br/>\nand catechesis. Yet I am also a Catholic parent, entrusted with<br/>\nmy child&#39;s Catholic education. My wife and I both consider<br/>\nhomeschooling a legitimate option. Thus my opinion concerning<br/>\nthis growing dispute will likely draw a fair amount of criticism<br/>\nfrom all sides - bishops, catechists, homeschooling parents and<br/>\neven many canonists. Yet if I have laid aside my initial<br/>\nhesitation and wandered into the debate, it is because children<br/>\nare the ones whose rights to the sacraments are threatened, and<br/>\nsomeone must defend their rights to the sacraments.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo summarize a rapidly growing situation, many Catholic parents<br/>\nopt for homeschooling after coming across doctrinal deficiencies<br/>\nin their children&#39;s catechesis. Granted, this is not the only<br/>\nreason parents homeschool their children, but the reason is not<br/>\nuncommon either. In response to this growing trend, the<br/>\ncatechetical establishment, concerned with parents using<br/>\nhomeschooling to circumvent the system, pressure bishops and<br/>\npastors to impose homeschooling guidelines. In short, the<br/>\ncatechetical establishment wishes to regain control over the<br/>\nsituation, perceiving homeschooling parents as fundamentalists.<br/>\nHomeschooling parents resist the implementation of such<br/>\nguidelines, resulting in pastors withholding the sacraments, and<br/>\neverything simply degenerates from there. Parents assert their<br/>\nrights as primary educators and pastors assert their right to<br/>\ngovern the faithful. Unfortunately, the rights most likely to<br/>\nfall by the wayside are those over whom this battle is being<br/>\nfought, namely homeschooled children. Caught in the middle of<br/>\nthis catechetical dispute, some homeschooled children now<br/>\nunjustly find themselves functionally excommunicated from the<br/>\nChurch&#39;s sacramental life.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are victimized because the three fundamental canonical<br/>\nissues pertaining to this dispute have not clearly been<br/>\ndistinguished from the outset. The first issue concerns the right<br/>\nof a diocesan Bishop to oversee catechesis within his diocese,<br/>\nincluding that of homeschooled children, and impose certain<br/>\nguidelines if he feels it necessary. The second concerns the<br/>\nobjection of parents to catechetical programs they perceive as<br/>\ndoctrinally deficient. And the third issue is the right of<br/>\nhomeschooled children, like all other Catholic children, to the<br/>\nadministration of the sacraments, particularly the Sacraments of<br/>\nInitiation (Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Eucharist.) I will<br/>\ntreat each issue separately in the order they were raised.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bishop&#39;s Right to Impose Guidelines<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginning with the right of the competent ecclesiastical<br/>\nauthority to oversee the catechesis of homeschooled children, as<br/>\nwell as impose certain guidelines, this right is implicit within<br/>\nCanon 774:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Canon 774 §1 The care for catechesis, under the direction of<br/>\nlawful ecclesiastical authority, extends to all members of the<br/>\nChurch, to each according to his or her role.<br/>\n&quot;§2 Before all others, parents are bound to form their children,<br/>\nby word and example, in faith and in christian living. The same<br/>\nobligation binds godparents and those who take the place of<br/>\nparents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow canon 774, §2 acknowledges both the natural right and the<br/>\nnatural obligation of parents as primary religious educators of<br/>\ntheir children. Nevertheless, in accordance with canon 17,<br/>\n&quot;Ecclesiastical laws are to be understood in with the proper<br/>\nmeaning of the words considered in their text and context.&quot; The<br/>\ncontext of canon 774&#39;s second paragraph is clear, in that the<br/>\nfirst paragraph acknowledges the obligation of the Church&#39;s<br/>\nlawful ecclesiastical authority to direct catechetical efforts.<br/>\nIn short, as Catholics we believe Christ established a visible<br/>\nhierarchy within His Church, with the power to sanctify, to teach<br/>\nand to govern in His name. Therefore, the role of the diocesan<br/>\nBishop and the parochial pastor, as it pertains to religious<br/>\neducation, can neither be ignored nor completely minimized.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis must be kept in mind by homeschooling parents. In outlining<br/>\nthe rights and obligations of the faithful vis-à-vis home<br/>\nreligious education, one must consider canon 223 §3 which states:<br/>\n&quot;in the interest of the common good, ecclesiastical authority has<br/>\ncompetence to regulate the exercise of the rights, which belong<br/>\nto the Christian faithful.&quot; In short, no right within the Code of<br/>\nCanon Law is absolute. While parents have the right to choose<br/>\ncatechetical resources approved by the Church, the diocesan<br/>\nBishop retains the right to impose certain catechetical<br/>\nrequirements. If parents are the primary catechists, then canon<br/>\n780 which obliges local Ordinaries &quot;to ensure that catechists are<br/>\nduly trained to carry out their office properly&quot; applies to<br/>\nparents as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Parent&#39;s Right to Sound Catechesis<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to the second issue, I frequently come across<br/>\nsituations where parents express concern over perceived doctrinal<br/>\ndeficiencies in their children&#39;s catechesis. In those situations<br/>\nwhere I agree with the concerns of the parents, I advise parents<br/>\nto approach their pastors. As canon 212 §2 maintains, &quot;Christ&#39;s<br/>\nfaithful are at liberty to make known their needs, especially<br/>\ntheir spiritual needs, and their wishes to the Pastors of the<br/>\nChurch.&quot; If Bishops and pastors are slow to respond to the needs<br/>\nof the parents, or if they outright dismiss the well-founded<br/>\nconcerns of the parents, an injustice ensues.<br/>\n<br/>\nCanon 213 clearly states: &quot;Christ&#39;s faithful have the right to be<br/>\nassisted by their Pastors from the spiritual riches of the<br/>\nChurch, especially by the word of God and the sacraments.&quot; Unless<br/>\ncatechesis is merely something incidental to the Church, in which<br/>\ncase one wonders about the necessity of such strict guidelines,<br/>\nthe demand pastors assist parents in providing children with<br/>\ndoctrinally sound catechesis is not merely something optional<br/>\nunder canon law, but an actual right of the faithful. This right<br/>\nis further clarified in canon 217 as follows: &quot;Since Christ&#39;s<br/>\nfaithful are called by baptism to lead a life in harmony with the<br/>\ngospel teaching, they have the right to a Christian education,<br/>\nwhich genuinely teaches them to strive for the maturity of the<br/>\nhuman person and at the same time to know and live the mystery of<br/>\nsalvation.&quot; Doctrinally deficient catechesis denies Christ&#39;s<br/>\nfaithful their canonical right to a Christian education. Should<br/>\nthis situation persist after notification of the competent<br/>\necclesiastical authority, in accordance with canon 221 §1,<br/>\n&quot;Christ&#39;s faithful may lawfully vindicate and defend the rights<br/>\nthey enjoy in the Church, before the competent ecclesiastical<br/>\nforum in accordance with the law.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Child&#39;s Right to the Sacraments<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving resolved the issue of catechesis, namely the Bishop&#39;s<br/>\nright to impose diocesan guidelines upon homeschooling parents,<br/>\nas well as the parents&#39; right to expect doctrinally sound<br/>\ncatechesis for their children from their pastors, let us turn our<br/>\nattention to the administration of the sacraments. Should the<br/>\nadministration of the sacraments, namely Confirmation and first<br/>\nHoly Communion, be strictly tied to a child&#39;s catechetical<br/>\nachievement? The answer to this question is no. Christ instituted<br/>\nthe sacraments as the primary means of God&#39;s grace, not as some<br/>\nsort of ecclesiastical graduation certificate after a lengthy and<br/>\nrigorous catechetical boot-camp. This is not what is intended by<br/>\nthe expression &quot;Church Militant.&quot; Consequently, nobody earns the<br/>\nright to partake of the sacraments, for none of us is worthy.<br/>\nRather, we partake of the sacraments through the merits of Jesus<br/>\nChrist.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, the current catechetical practice in many parts of<br/>\nNorth America does not reflect the Church&#39;s theology in this<br/>\nregard. This problem does not uniquely affect homeschooling<br/>\nchildren; the problem is common to most Catholic children in the<br/>\nUnited States and Canada, where the traditional order for<br/>\nadministering the Sacraments of Initiation is disrupted, and<br/>\nConfirmation is often deferred by diocesan catechetical<br/>\nrequirements until adolescence. This is done because many within<br/>\nthe catechetical establishment advocate a theology of &quot;mature&quot;<br/>\nfaith, expecting teenagers to fulfill a lengthy and rigorous<br/>\ncatechetical process, complete various service projects, and<br/>\ngenerally demonstrate an &quot;adult&quot; faith. While such goals are<br/>\nworthy within the strict context of catechesis, historically and<br/>\ntheologically they had little to do with preparation for the<br/>\nSacrament of Confirmation until the onslaught of Jansenism. The<br/>\ninfluence exerted by Jansenism over the catechetical preparation<br/>\nof children for the Sacraments is well explained by Fr. John<br/>\nHuels, a noted canonist and liturgical scholar, in his essay &quot;The<br/>\nAge for Confirmation.&quot; The following excerpts are particularly<br/>\ninsightful:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Early in the twentieth century, Pope Pius X combated the<br/>\nJansenistic influence over pastoral practice and religious<br/>\neducation in many countries. This rigoristic spirituality held<br/>\nthat most people were unworthy to receive communion frequently<br/>\nand that children had to prove themselves worthy for first holy<br/>\ncommunion through an extended catechetical program up to the age<br/>\nof ten, twelve, fourteen or older. The pope responded by<br/>\nstandardizing the age for the reception of first communion and<br/>\nfirst penance at seven. Confirmation was still supposed to<br/>\nprecede first communion, but it became impossible everywhere for<br/>\nthe bishop to make it to each parish all the time before children<br/>\nof seven received their first communion; so confirmation often<br/>\nwas administered out of sequence after the children had already<br/>\nreceived the eucharist.<br/>\n&quot;With the growing frequency of the postponement of confirmation<br/>\nto after first communion, the spirit of Jansenism resurfaced in<br/>\npastoral practice and in religious education in the twentieth<br/>\ncentury. It was not eucharist, the sacrament that completes<br/>\nChristian initiation, but confirmation, the second sacrament,<br/>\nwhich was said to require lengthy catechesis, &#39;mature&#39; faith and<br/>\nother requirements of parish or catechetical policy before<br/>\nchildren or adolescents could demonstrate their worthiness to<br/>\nreceive it.<br/>\n&quot;All the while, this custom of delaying confirmation was contrary<br/>\nto canon law; the 1917 code, canon 788, said that confirmation<br/>\nshould be delayed to about the age of seven but it could be given<br/>\nearlier if an infant were in danger of death or the minister had<br/>\njust and serious reasons for confirming soon. This contrary<br/>\npractice of delaying confirmation beyond seven only became an<br/>\noption in law in 1971, and this came about despite the views of<br/>\nliturgical experts who had recommended to Pope Paul VI that there<br/>\nbe no change in the law.<br/>\n&quot;As a result of studies uncovering the history of confirmation,<br/>\ncontemporary theologians have been critical of the<br/>\nabove-mentioned &#39;spiritual maturity&#39; theology and praxis of<br/>\nconfirmation. They argue not only that it does not correspond to<br/>\nthe origins of the sacrament but also that it ritually and<br/>\ntheologically demands too much of confirmation to the<br/>\ndiminishment of baptism and eucharist.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of where they otherwise fall on the ideological<br/>\nspectrum, many canonists, myself included, agree with Fr. Huels&#39;<br/>\nanalysis of the above situation. Admittedly, canon law currently<br/>\npermits a diocesan Bishop to extend the age at which Confirmation<br/>\nmay be administered, but this is merely a concession owing to<br/>\nhistorical circumstance. It does not mean the age of confirmation<br/>\nshould be extended, and Fr. Huels presents strong arguments why<br/>\nit should not. Furthermore, some catechists will argue Fr. Huels&#39;<br/>\ns analysis merely concerns a broader issue, namely the overly<br/>\ndemanding catechetical requirements preceding administration of<br/>\nConfirmation. I will not dispute this as the context in which Fr.<br/>\nHuels writes. Nevertheless, his insights still apply within the<br/>\ncurrent homeschooling debate. After all, children do not forfeit<br/>\ntheir rights within the Church - especially the right to receive<br/>\nthe sacraments in a timely order - simply because their parents<br/>\nhomeschool them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow granted, some homeschooling parents hold a doctrinally<br/>\nfundamentalist view of the Catholic faith that can become<br/>\nunhealthy. When this occurs, the Church must remind parents that<br/>\nobedience to one&#39;s lawful ecclesiastical superior is one of the<br/>\nfundamental tenets of Catholicism. Nevertheless, the fault in<br/>\nsuch instances belongs to the parents, and not to the children<br/>\nwho unfortunately bear the brunt of the resulting functional<br/>\nexcommunication from the sacraments. Moreover, the current<br/>\ncatechetical establishment is just as guilty of the charge of<br/>\nrigorism, although in the area of process rather than doctrine.<br/>\nFor in insisting homeschooled children adhere to strict diocesan<br/>\nstandards before seeking admission to the sacraments, the<br/>\ncatechetical establishment ought to keep in mind the Jansenistic<br/>\nroots of rigorous sacramental preparation, especially before<br/>\nlabeling homeschooling parents as fundamentalists.<br/>\nPete Vere // 12:25 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://canonlaw.blogspot.com/2002_08_01_canonlaw_archive.html#804\">http://canonlaw.blogspot.com/2002_08_01_canonlaw_archive.html#804</a><br/>\n14753</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8036,"nextTopicId":42550}}
