From all accounts <br/>\n(haven&#39;t seen it myself) it does an effective job of short-circuiting reason <br/>\nand going straight for the emotional jugular vein, even of non-Christians one <br/>\nway or another. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Religion is all about Power of Story, and so are the movies.

Apparently <br/>\nhe rejects most tenets of organized Catholicism, including the Pope&#39;s <br/>\ninfallibility. OTOH, I am neither Catholic nor Jewish, nor have I see the movie, so <br/>\nwhat do I know? &lt;g&gt; The point is that there are questions, lots of reasonable <br/>\nquestions, when one isn&#39;t all caught up in vivid, violent, emotional power of <br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing that I especially liked is that Mr. Gibson didn&#39;t ignore the <br/>\n&gt; spiritual warfare aspect of the entire situation. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       Like it or not, this may be the most insightful comment I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nANYONE make about this movie, Elizabeth!

I didn&#39;t have a problem with what was shown in a technical manner of the violence. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the opening scene, He steps on a snake. The fight between the apostles and the soldiers is not graphic, although they do clearly show the guy who lost an ear...but Christ heals him. <br/>\n <br/>\nAt His arrest, he&#39;s hit and spat upon. He&#39;s sent to be tortured, but not killed, by Pilate. A Cat-o&#39;nine-tail is a brutal weapon. The damage shown actually...wasn&#39;t quite as bloody as it would have been in real life. It was more that you could clearly see the edges of the openings, whereas in real-life, had someone been beaten that severly there would have been much more blood. The blood in that scene was more of the trail as they dragged Christ away. The Roman soldiers are portrayed as enjoying what they are doing though, which &quot;could&quot; be true. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey do keep punching and kicking Christ at just about every oppportunity, and are shown using the butt of a spear to press the thorny crown into His head. As He is carrying the cross, they continue to strike at Him to keep Him going as if He was an animal. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe crucifixion scene itself shows them placing the nail on his hand, then shows them drawing back to drive it in...then shows it poking through the wood beneath with blood running down. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe only part that I didn&#39;t actually watch was while, on their crosses, after taunting Christ, the one theif has an eye poked out by a crow. <br/>\n <br/>\nAfterwards, when the soldier pierces Christ&#39;s side, the blood is showing spewing forth..showering the soldier, rather than seeping out as is commonly portrayed. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat affected me was that it is so easy, even as a Christian, to just think..Ok, Christ died for my sins and it happened to be up on a cross. To keep it in a sanitized sort of understanding, not dwelling on the brutality of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis movie brought that home in a way nothing else has. I fully came to realize that anyone else would not have been able to keep going through all of that, let alone to live so long upon the cross. And the fact that He CHOSE to do so is amazingly wonderful. <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are some very Catholic overtones to the story as it is portrayed, but given that the director is a devout Catholic, then it&#39;s to be expected. But overall, it is true to the Gospels and wonderful. <br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing that I especially liked is that Mr. Gibson didn&#39;t ignore the spiritual warfare aspect of the entire situation. Satan is there prominently, taunting Christ and trying to get Him to give up. While the Scriptures don&#39;t mention that Satan was there, it&#39;s easy to understand that he must have been...how could he not have tried, especially given his earlier temptations to Christ? <br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 3/4/04 7:11:25 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamabethuscg@...\">mamabethuscg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; There is much worse violence in many other movies.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you see it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Rhonda thought it was the worst she had ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

He said he did want to go, even though its subtitled <br/>\nand he isnt the quickest reader yet. I wasnt too worried about the <br/>\nviolence aspect because he isnt that sensitive and has been exposed <br/>\nto alot of different movies. The only movie that i actually felt <br/>\nsuper uncomfortable letting him watch was &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, <br/>\nwhich was actually kinda weird and funny but SUPER gory (probably one <br/>\nof the most gory movies ive ever seen), it was just too &quot;in your <br/>\nface&quot;, and i asked him if he wanted $5 to go play video games instead <br/>\n(in retrospect, not the safest thing to do!), and he jumped at the <br/>\nchance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll definantly offer him the chance to watch &quot;Passion&quot; when we get <br/>\nit on DVD, so he can stop it or leave the room if he wants. But i <br/>\ncan&#39;t really imagine keeping a 16 yo from watching anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, i find emotionally &quot;violent&quot; movies or scenes way more <br/>\ndamaging to my psyche....i will NEVER forget how i felt during the <br/>\nseen in Schindler&#39;s List, where all the children were loaded up in <br/>\ntrucks and were being driven off, waving goodbye to their mothers, <br/>\nwho ran toward them screaming for their children. That pierced my <br/>\nsoul, just the idea of it. Or the scene in Sophie&#39;s Choice, in which <br/>\nSophie must choose which child will die, her daughter or her son. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t even bring myself to finish the second half of &quot;Life Is <br/>\nBeautiful&quot;...as soon as the Nazis showed up, i turned it off.

Mel Gibson states that he wanted to be true to the <br/>\nGospels, and so i went and reread the crucifiction parts. Pilate IS <br/>\nprotrayed sympathetically there. Also its ridiculous for anyone to <br/>\nsay that &quot;the Jews&quot; were the villians, as obviously Jesus, Mary, Mary <br/>\nMagdalene, and all of the disciples were Jewish. From everything i&#39;ve <br/>\nheard on tv programs, yes, the &quot;Jewish religious leaders&quot; were not <br/>\nportrayed very positively, but again, they arent exactly heroes in <br/>\nthe New Testament either. I think there is some merit to the argument <br/>\nthat many of the arguments against this movie are arguments against <br/>\nthe Gospels themselves.

Christians believe that Jesus came to <br/>\nearth for the very purpose to die for our sins. He was the <br/>\n&quot;sacrificial lamb&quot;, accepted this role, and did not try to flee or to <br/>\ndefend himself. Mel Gibson has stated that this is the reason it is <br/>\nHIS hand that was filmed pounding the first nail into Jesus&#39; palm, <br/>\nbecause he feels HE is as much to &quot;blame&quot; for the death as anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

I actually wish I had been more <br/>\nmoved. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"joylyn","from":"joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Ugly movies","postDate":"1078454348","msgId":91615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNDdFODRDLjQwNzA5MDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNS4yYmY3YTdjZC4yZDc5NDA4N0Bhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzNS4yYmY3YTdjZC4yZDc5NDA4N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91614,"nextInTopic":91616,"prevInTime":91614,"nextInTime":91616,"topicId":91598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here is a great link to look closely at movies, their content, etc. www.gradingthemovies.com Here is the link for Passion of Christ ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1607751828\">Here is a great link to look closely at movies, their content, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nwww.gradingthemovies.com<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the link for Passion of Christ<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gradingthemovies.com/html/mv/gtm_mv001150.shtml\">http://www.gradingthemovies.com/html/mv/gtm_mv001150.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis site has a very christain leaning, and one shouldn&#39;t read the <br/>\nreviews if you don&#39;t want the ending given away (although that&#39;s hardly <br/>\na problem in Passion) but I have found it helpful for me in making <br/>\nchoices regarding which movies I want to see myself, or which movies I <br/>\nwant to take young children to see.

When I was a controlling type <br/>\nof parent, I use to have the rule *no R rated movies unless watched at home <br/>\nwith a parent present*.  My rationale was that at home my children would be free <br/>\nto leave the room if they were disturbed by something, and a parent would be <br/>\nclose at hand if they wanted to talk about something.  I still think watching <br/>\nmovies that might be disturbing at home with a parent is a good idea, but we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have this rule anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really like watching movies at home and am very disturbed personally <br/>\nby graphic displays of violence, and I&#39;m probably more sensitive in this area <br/>\nthan any of my children.  Letting go of the *a parent must be present* rule <br/>\ngives my children the chance to see lots more movies.  Also my 15 yo dd looks <br/>\nlike an adult and no one ever questions her when she goes to see movies at the <br/>\ntheater.  It probably doesn&#39;t hurt that all of her friends are 17 or older. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best things about dropping the movie rules is that my kids are now <br/>\nfar more discerning in what they watch.  I think before they thought it was <br/>\ncool to watch horror movies and now they just say *I don&#39;t like that*.   Having <br/>\nthe freedom to watch anything, helps them decide what they really do want to <br/>\nwatch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a child who needed me to get into an R movie at the theaters, and I <br/>\nreally didn&#39;t want to see that movie, I would try to recruit another adult to <br/>\nsee it with them.  If this wasn&#39;t possible, they&#39;d have to wait &#39;til it came <br/>\nout on DVD...which doesn&#39;t take all that long now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Jacqueline <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Ugly movies","postDate":"1078413701","msgId":91599,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEEzOTUxQUJBLTZERUYtMTFEOC04QUU1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMyN2dkOSttN3JqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMyN2dkOSttN3JqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91598,"nextInTopic":91600,"prevInTime":91598,"nextInTime":91600,"topicId":91598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If she seriously thoughtfully understanding how gruesome it was going to be - still wanted to see it, I d let her.
