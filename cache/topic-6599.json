When<br/>\n&gt; they realized that I was dyslexic, I got the support that I needed, which<br/>\n&gt; was different from what I would have needed if I had a different issue.<br/>\n&gt; Right now I am starting to get hot flashes. I need that label to try and<br/>\n&gt; figure out ways of dealing with them. I can use the label to identify what<br/>\n&gt; is going on, research options and then figure out what I want to do about<br/>\n&gt; it. (the I is bolded) My middle son did a Myers-Briggs inventory. He scored<br/>\n&gt; 100% extrovert. The person who did the inventory had never seen anyone who<br/>\n&gt; was as strongly extroverted on that scale. I haven&#39;t either. A good friend<br/>\n&gt; of his is an introvert. They know that about each other and it helps their<br/>\n&gt; friendship to be able to communicate their needs. When my son is at their<br/>\n&gt; house and his friend needs time to himself, my son hangs out with the<br/>\n&gt; brother and sister. Everyone wins because they identify and communicate<br/>\n&gt; their needs and the labels help them do that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When labels are used to demystify, explain, get support, provide insight<br/>\n&gt; and help, they are good. When they are used to discriminate, judge, exclude,<br/>\n&gt; put down or ridicule, they are bad. It isn&#39;t the labels that are bad. The<br/>\n&gt; labels are what they are; they are descriptions. It is how they are used<br/>\n&gt; that is good or bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When someone on the list used the label &quot;autistic behavior&quot; or &quot;autism&quot;, I<br/>\n&gt; had a good picture in my head about the kinds of issues that they are<br/>\n&gt; dealing with. Same with the label dyslexia. Using the label &quot;unschooler&quot;<br/>\n&gt; helps me to find other families with a similar learning and parenting<br/>\n&gt; philosophy. I use the label proudly, but others may use it in a derogatory<br/>\n&gt; manner. I don&#39;t share the label of my religion because I worry about<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s reaction. It isn&#39;t my religion or even the label that I have a<br/>\n&gt; problem with, it is the reaction of others.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And don&#39;t get me going on gay rights.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jae G<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337544642,"authorName":"carnationsgalore","from":"&quot;carnationsgalore&quot; &lt;addled.homemaker@...&gt;","profile":"carnationsgalore","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New to list","postDate":"1219582768","msgId":37466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc4cmx2Zys3cTJxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc4bnF2YSthaGRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37459,"nextInTopic":37468,"prevInTime":37465,"nextInTime":37467,"topicId":6599,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Put an  <br/>\nelectric fan by your bed so you won&#39;t be blaming your husband or the  <br/>\nbuilders of your house when it&#39;s suddenly way too hot at 3:00 a.m.     <br/>\nRealize that the hot flashes only last a few moments and it&#39;s not  <br/>\ngoing to kill you.  (It will feel like it might sometimes, but try  <br/>\nnot to whimper and whine or freeze the rest of your family out, as I  <br/>\ndo sometimes with the car&#39;s air conditioning.)  Turns out Prozac  <br/>\nhelps, so for those prone to depression, they might want to use  <br/>\nProzac through the up seasons too, to deal with the hot flashes for a  <br/>\nfew years.  (It&#39;s less invasive than hormone replacement therapy, I&#39;m  <br/>\npretty sure.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-A good friend of his is an introvert.

But I would like to reassure you that not <br/>\nonly is it possible to radically unschool a child with an autistic <br/>\nspectrum dx but that it was, in fact, my DS that led us to radical <br/>\nunschooling.  Mainstream parenting simply didn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; and DH and I <br/>\nwere forced to take a long, hard look at our son and our parenting <br/>\nassumptions. I knew DS would not survive in school, so keeping him at <br/>\nhome was the first step for us. Punishment looked cruel when clearly <br/>\nhe couldn&#39;t help his behaviour, trying to get his attention focussed <br/>\non something that wasn&#39;t his agenda was nigh on impossible and  you <br/>\nget the picture. The long , hard look led to research and the <br/>\ndiscovery of radical unschooling and, while still learning, we have <br/>\nnot looked back. Our younger DS (age 3) may well have &quot;issues&quot; too, <br/>\nbut we have never sought an outside opinion and he has always been <br/>\nradically unschooled to the best of our (improving) abilities.

When they realized that I was dyslexic, I got the support that I needed, which was different from what I would have needed if I had a different issue. Right now I am starting to get hot flashes. I need that label to try and figure out ways of dealing with them. I can use the label to identify what is going on, research options and then figure out what I want to do about it. (the I is bolded) My middle son did a Myers-Briggs inventory. He scored 100% extrovert. The person who did the inventory had never seen anyone who was as strongly extroverted on that scale. I haven&#39;t either. A good friend of his is an introvert. They know that about each other and it helps their friendship to be able to communicate their needs.

Very <br/>\ninspiring.        <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was quite severely autistic when he was young.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>\ncapable of conversations; he just echoed back words and phrases he <br/>\nhad heard in Disney movies and books I had read him.  What he echoed <br/>\nnever fit the situation.  He spent all day either jumping up and <br/>\ndown, or rocking back and forth flapping his hands.  He never <br/>\nresponded to his name and tantrummed almost all day long.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>\nhaving tantrums because I had told him &quot;no,&quot; but because of something <br/>\ninside of him that I didn&#39;t understand at the time.  He didn&#39;t know <br/>\nhow to play, had no imagination.  He was just sort of locked inside <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding out he had autism helped point me in the right direction to <br/>\nhelp him.  He didn&#39;t get the diagnosis until he was almost 4.  His <br/>\ndoctor, like many pediatricians at the time didn&#39;t know much about <br/>\nautism either.  Shortly after I changed his diet, took out all gluten <br/>\nand dairy and artificial ingredients, as is recommended by some (not <br/>\nmainstream) for children with autism.  He started talking <br/>\nspontaneously after this diet change, no echoing after 2 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay therapy helped me learn how to join him in his world and connect <br/>\nwith him, so he could join our world.  I met an amazing person, a <br/>\ntherapist, who taught me how to play with him, how to connect with <br/>\nhim.  I played with him every moment possible.  Slowly, but surely <br/>\nover time he started to blossom and his imagination started to grow.  <br/>\nNow his imagination is enormous and he loves to play.  However he <br/>\nstill struggles with playing by himself.  He always wants me or <br/>\nsomeone with him, which is fine because I love keeping the connection <br/>\nstrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the great value in not having labels, in their affect on a <br/>\nperson&#39;s self esteem.  People are people; we all have our different <br/>\nways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut for us, the diagnosis gave me a jumping point, a place to look to <br/>\nhelp him feel better, to be able to connect with him.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave thought to look to a diet to help him, or have known about the <br/>\nplay therapy, or met the person who taught me how to do it, if I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have the label autism to start with.  I saw many children at <br/>\nhis school who couldn&#39;t have conversations, and did all the things my <br/>\nson used to do.  I am certain that without the diet and the play <br/>\ntherapy, he&#39;d still be doing those things, and be locked inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, at this point, he is considered &quot;high functioning.&quot;  I am <br/>\nexcited to move to the next step and help him grow more and blossom <br/>\nby doing what he wants to do.  The label was relevant also for <br/>\nschool.  In fact they made it central.  Now we are at a place where <br/>\nwe can slip off the autism label and he can just be Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all who responded to my initial email!

I am Teresa, I have one child, <br/>\nBen who is 11, and also has a diagnosis of PDD, NOS, on the autism <br/>\nspectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Minnesota.  My son didn&#39;t go to school until he was in 2nd <br/>\ngrade.  There was a new charter school that seemed to have a program <br/>\nthat might work for Ben.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was really stressed out most of the time (which makes me feel <br/>\nbad), but he did also get something out of it, like a best friend, <br/>\nand learned a few things.  I was nervous about sending him and ended <br/>\nup spending most of the day at the school volunteering so I could <br/>\ntake a peek periodically and see how he was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he went to this school for a few years.  This last year, his best <br/>\nfriend got angry with Ben for some reason, and decided he wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to talk to him anymore.  He got a few other students to join in <br/>\non the ignoring.  Most of the class was giving him the cold shoulder, <br/>\nacting like he wasn&#39;t there.  My son was becoming sadder and more <br/>\nwithdrawn and I didn&#39;t know why.  He tried to tell me, and actually <br/>\ndid a pretty good job, but I didn&#39;t understand how serious it was, or <br/>\nrealize how much it affected him.  I feel horrible I didn&#39;t pull him <br/>\nsooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school didn&#39;t notice it was happening, and when it was finally <br/>\nfigured out, they refused to do anything about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I decided I needed to pull him out.  I hated seeing what was <br/>\nhappening to him, to his self worth and feeling of emotional safety.  <br/>\nFor many months it seemed he was afraid I would abandon him too, like <br/>\nhis best friend.  He is still quite clingy, and needs to know where I <br/>\nam or be with me all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to keep him out of school.

And I&#39;m a book lover to my core.  I would probably find the books<br/>\ninteresting and enlightening even though I&#39;m already dedicated to<br/>\nunschooling, but I have such little time to read for myself with three young<br/>\nkids, that I like to use that time reading things that are new to me.  It&#39;s<br/>\nthe same way with being a vegetarian to me...once I made that decision, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to read any books on the subject to encourage me.  When my<br/>\nchoices come from the heart, I generally don&#39;t need anyone affirming them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I&#39;m not misunderstood...I am in no way disregarding the importance of<br/>\nthe books on the subject of unschooling.  I&#39;m certain a lot of them are<br/>\nfabulous, and I do hope to read some of them when I have more time, but my<br/>\npoint was that I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; a book to help me decide to unschool...simply<br/>\nhearing about the concept was enough to hook me!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for writing, Ann.
