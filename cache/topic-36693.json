My daughter, Jeri is 7.  She attended private preschool <br/>\nand kindergarten and 3 months of public 1st grade.  We started out <br/>\nusing books given to us by her teacher when we took her out of <br/>\nschool.  Then I bought a Learn At Home curriculum that seemed fun but <br/>\nwe had a hard time sticking to the schedule.  We skipped a lot <br/>\nbecause it was too easy or just seemed redundant which resulted in <br/>\nfrustration.  After that we started picking theme studies that my <br/>\ndaughter said she was interested in.  We got bored fast doing that. <br/>\nNow we are just doing whatever.  I am trying to find a way to explain <br/>\nto Jeri what we are doing since she is used to doing &quot;school&quot; and <br/>\nreally likes to tell people what grade she is in.  Going from all to <br/>\nnothing with regard to structure seems like a huge leap even though <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t have an incredible amount of structure.  She asked me a <br/>\nlittle bit ago what we were doing tomorrow.  She does that every <br/>\nnight before bed.  I just told her tonight that we were going to do <br/>\nstuff.  She said &quot;are we going to do school?&quot;  I just stated <br/>\nagain, &quot;just stuff&quot;.  She walked away kind of puzzled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any tips?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJackie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36695,"nextTopicId":36658}}
