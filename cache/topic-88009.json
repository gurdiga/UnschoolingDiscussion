He is much like you&#39;ve described, but I&#39;m really trying to avoid any kind of testing or labeling with him. Everyday, I&#39;m just thankful that he&#39;s not going into a school setting because there&#39;s no way he&#39;d survive there. <br/>\n<br/>\nSam has good days and bad days, so I&#39;m hopeful that there may be some kind of food trigger that could help us a bit. I am reading _Is This Your Child_ by Dorris Rapp and looking into the Feingold diet, which has been found useful for ADHD as well-- www.feingold.org is their website, I think. Right now, I&#39;m keeping a food diary and trying to eliminate much of the processed foods and colorings from our home. The thing that I don&#39;t like about this is the focus on the negative. The food diary has you record everything your child eats and observe their behavior throughout the day, the idea being that you will begin to see connections over time. I don&#39;t like always having to focus on the negative with him--it&#39;s much better to do what Julie suggested and revel in the positive! But the feingold diet allows lots of substitutions, so it&#39;s very livable, in my opinion. You might not be able to have one brand of potato chips, but you can have this brand, kind of thing. If I end up trying to eliminate dairy, that will be a whole &#39;nother story!<br/>\n<br/>\nSam spends many nights in our bed for a good portion of the night. He&#39;s not sleeping well, which I know from when he comes in and when he leaves. I&#39;m wondering if this is a food sensitivity sign. He also gets red-rimmed ears and red cheeks; he chews on the corners of his blanket and bites his finger and toe-nails to the quick--I&#39;ve _never_ had to trim his nails that I can recall. He often has a hard time sitting still, though he can focus on the computer for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost days I spend gently trying to talk him down from some potential crisis or avoiding something that I&#39;m pretty sure will set him off, and that gets downright exhausting! I can&#39;t even imagine someone else dealing with him in a school setting--patience would be no where in sight, I&#39;m sure! I&#39;m hoping to find something useful with the food sensitivity thing because that might give us one more tool to work with. Often, he&#39;s not even really upset about whatever it is that&#39;s he fussing about; it&#39;s more like something inside him that is making him _have_ to fuss or lash out. Even when I remove or correct whatever it is, he&#39;s still way off and finds another focus for his anger, you know? That&#39;s what makes me wonder if it&#39;s a food reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenevieve wrote:<br/>\nI started getting frustrated about this situation about 6 months ago when we tried to go camping and on various outings and he&#39;d just be plain dangerous and so hard to bring around that it&#39;s not worth the outing just because of all the frustration it brings to everyone else in the family. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, we went to a homeschool ice skate, and he was being a real bear. I spent the whole time with him not being able to pay much attention to my girls (5 and 6) who were skating for the first time, too. Thank goodness they had skate buddies (pvc walker things) to hang on to, or it just wouldn&#39;t have worked! Well, at one point I was taking him off the ice to try to talk with him and calm him down, when one mother laughingly commented that we were often in that situation and no wonder I stayed so skinny.  Sam often makes our outings far more difficult than they would otherwise be, even though he really wants to be there doing whatever it is that we&#39;re doing. I don&#39;t want to leave him home because I feel that would be punitive. Sam is Sam. He has always been high need and will someday be an absolutely incredible person with all this energy. My job right now is to help him learn how to deal with who he is in a way that works for him and to protect him from all the negativity that society would heap on him in the name of education or medical well-being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t have any answers yet. I may never have any more answer than Sam is Sam. But, I can understand your frustration and exhaustion. I&#39;m trying to find as many positive tools as possible to live with and love my guy. Unschooling, many tenets of TCS, an open bed, attachment parenting, my constant loving presence, and now diet changes are all the tools in my toolbox right now.  Seek out the positive tools and leave behind the negative ones that tell you, &quot;what this boy really needs is discipline!&quot; There are many people and experts out there who will say that, and as tempting as it might be to buy into it, those methods will never be anything but a temporary crutch that serves to cripple you both in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there Genevieve!  The best thing you can do is find as many places as you can that keep your parenting on track and help you get through the frustrating times. This support might come from reading and re-reading passages in helpful books like Joyce recommended, from this unschooling list, from local groups like La Leche League that preach and practice attachment parenting--all of these work for me. The key is to stay positive and focused on the good things and the kind of parent you want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Discipline, frustrations and all that\tgoes with it","postDate":"1073475613","msgId":88051,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDMjE1QTRELjIyQ0NFJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjYy4xNzNkOGNhNy4yZDJjY2FhN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":88050,"nextInTopic":88058,"prevInTime":88050,"nextInTime":88052,"topicId":88009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But the seizing control is a symptom of the control he feels<br/>\nelsewhere in his life. If he doesn&#39;t feel that sense of being controled<br/>\nelsewhere, then he won&#39;t need to seize inappropriate times to assert his own<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thought is: You&#39;re speaking a foreign language to him. He may not<br/>\nbe developmentally ready to process what you&#39;re saying in the way he needs<br/>\nto understand. You can be plain as plain but he&#39;s just not ready to<br/>\nunderstand. And if he can&#39;t understand the idea of safety, then it&#39;s still<br/>\nyour job to be by his side while he explores.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try talking about taking off on his own before you go into a<br/>\ncrowded situation. Not in a rulish way, but in an informational way. Expect<br/>\nthat he&#39;s not going to understand and it&#39;s still your responsibility to be<br/>\nwith him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try having a conversation with him at some relaxed time, like when<br/>\nyou&#39;re in the car together going for ice cream (or hot chocolate depending<br/>\nwhere you are right now ;-) Talk about what he feels when he runs off. What<br/>\nis it he&#39;s thinking? Ask him if when he&#39;s headed off if he thinks at all<br/>\nabout what you&#39;ve discussed with him about the dangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t judge his answers. Don&#39;t even think about what he should be thinking<br/>\nor doing. That will just clam him up and you want him to open up, confess to<br/>\nyou the things he&#39;d privately tell a friend about what&#39;s wrong in his life.<br/>\nYou&#39;re just trying to get information from him so you can think up better<br/>\nways for you all to be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the standard way of approaching problems with kids is to 1) identify<br/>\nthe problem, 2) come up with a solution and then 3) turn the solution the<br/>\nparent comes up with into the problem that needs solved. So instead of the<br/>\nproblem being helping him explore safely, the problem becomes how to make<br/>\nhim obey the rules you&#39;ve come up with to fix the original problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry brainstorming solutions with him. Tell him you&#39;re concerned about his<br/>\nsafety and you&#39;re wondering if he can help you come up with ways you can<br/>\nboth get what you want: you can feel he&#39;s safe and he can explore to his<br/>\nheart&#39;s content. Maybe think of him as though he were a 21 year old with the<br/>\nunderstanding that he doesn&#39;t need to do what you tell him any more. So if<br/>\nyou want him to do something, it has to be by mutual agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on both of your feelings and needs. See this as a negotiation between<br/>\ntwo people with needs that clash and you&#39;re trying to find a way to get both<br/>\nneeds met, not have the &quot;most important&quot; need override the &quot;less important&quot;<br/>\nneed. From his point of view, his need is way more important than yours.<br/>\nTreat them as equally important and work towards something you can both be<br/>\nhappy with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he can&#39;t meet your need to keep him safe, then maybe the thing to do is<br/>\navoid large crowds unless it&#39;s a kid request as much as possible until he is<br/>\nold enough to understand. Not as a punishment, but as a family reality that<br/>\nit&#39;s just not possible at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe I don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the whole natural<br/>\n&gt; consequence thing.  I get the main idea, but it seems that when it&#39;s out<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;easy&quot; borders, I just chicken out and can&#39;t let go.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids want to know they can depend on us to keep them safe while they explore<br/>\nthe world. They&#39;d want to be stopped before stepping in front of a car. If<br/>\nthey want to explore something in a crowded place, they don&#39;t want to be<br/>\nstopped. They want someone there &quot;fighting off the tigers&quot; so they can<br/>\nexplore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t thought about it like this before, but parents often use the term<br/>\n&quot;natural consequences&quot; in the same way they&#39;d use parentally imposed<br/>\nconsequences. Both uses are coming from the mindset of wanting the child to<br/>\ndo what they parent thinks they should. So the choice for the parent is to<br/>\nimpose consequences when the child does something he shouldn&#39;t, or to let<br/>\nthe child suffer the natural consequences and learn the lesson the parent<br/>\nwants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t the point people are trying to make. What people are discussing<br/>\nis helping kids explore the world safely. So the main goal is exploring the<br/>\nworld. That&#39;s the focus.

Maybe I don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the whole natural<br/>\nconsequence thing.

Honestly? <br/>\nNO!!!  I couldn&#39;t do that, but lately, the idea comes up as a &quot;Maybe if<br/>\nyou tried this he&#39;d understand&quot;.  I *know* it wouldn&#39;t work, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever done it, it probably comes from friends I know who make their kids<br/>\nbehave with reasonings like these.  The farthest I&#39;ve been is no desert,<br/>\nusually because he&#39;s goofing around with his food and hasn&#39;t eaten for<br/>\nlike 15 minutes and I know he isn&#39;t hungry.  It&#39;ll usually be a &quot;fruit<br/>\nor yogourt desert instead of ...&quot; but even then, if I&#39;ve made a special<br/>\ndesert and I know they&#39;re not eating because they know what&#39;s coming, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t deprive him of it...<br/>\n <br/>\nBecause that&#39;s withholding love and food, and neither will ever make a<br/>\nboy <br/>\nnicer or calmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guess from what you wrote is that you&#39;ve been pushing him away<br/>\ninstead of <br/>\ndrawing him nearer, and that your &quot;natural consequences&quot; haven&#39;t been<br/>\ntoo <br/>\nnatural.<br/>\n<br/>\n** That&#39;s what I&#39;m scared of.  I feel like I can&#39;t let go of a lot of<br/>\nhis &quot;goofyness&quot; and it&#39;s making me resentful and all.  I started getting<br/>\nfrustrated about this situation about 6 months ago when we tried to go<br/>\ncamping and on various outings and he&#39;d just be plain dangerous and so<br/>\nhard to bring around that it&#39;s not worth the outing just because of all<br/>\nthe frustration it brings to everyone else in the family.  I do accept a<br/>\nlot ( I think so, anyways!) but because of his big ideas, I&#39;m often<br/>\nscared of letting him go, and I guess he doesn&#39;t like being close to us,<br/>\nhe want&#39;s to explore (which is legitimate) but there&#39;s a security<br/>\nperimiter (within sight in woods, or even earshot)  in case anything<br/>\nhappens, which he just can&#39;t stand, he&#39;s always pushing the limit, mine,<br/>\nnot his.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for natural consequences, how far do they have to go?? I mean, I have<br/>\na problem with letting him burn himself on the campfire, but then again<br/>\nif it&#39;s what it takes, should it be acceptable?  How about meals? How<br/>\nmuch bad manners should be acceptable??  Maybe my &quot;danger zone&quot; is too<br/>\nfluffy and I should let him bump himself a couple of times??<br/>\n <br/>\nWriting this, I feel I&#39;m trying to heal the wrong problem.  I&#39;m trying<br/>\nto make his world better, but not our relationship.  I guess I should<br/>\nstart by trying to be more &quot;in-tune&quot; with HIS needs and try really hard<br/>\nto satisfy them before trying to solve the other things.

Not a big deal for most for some that can be just too intense, like talking to someone and having them continually kiss or hug you. Not having a clue as to what you just said...I still have problems with that all the time and people have to repeat themselves. Either I&#39;m deep in thought or the words just seem to pass in and out too quickly. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  This seems to be turning out as a big frustration about him, but gosh, I<br/>\n  feel like I&#39;m in a dead-end zone, and everyone around me give me<br/>\n  suggestions like, &quot; You should send him to school next year, it&#39;ll be<br/>\n  easier on you&quot;, or &quot; you should find some medication for him to calm him<br/>\n  down&quot;, or &quot; You should discipline him way more, you&#39;re too easy with<br/>\n  him&quot; etc.. But I don&#39;t feel comfortable with those, I feel like if *I*<br/>\n  do something on my side to ease out his days, he&#39;ll get better and life<br/>\n  too!<br/>\n  Okay, since I&#39;m ADD I&#39;ll just approach it from there...It may be food dyes, allergies, type of discipline, something else but others on this list are more qualified to speak to those. It may also be a diagnosable condition like mine. I DO think ADD/ADHD is often a scapegoat and overdiagnosed but when it affects a homelife (as opposed to an artificial school environment) so deeply, it may be something to look at.  A diagnoses isn&#39;t simply for a prescription but gives you a category to research (though you don&#39;t really need that I guess to research) and things like behaviour modifying techniques (doesn&#39;t that sound awful? Though my Behav. Mod involves mostly Dayrunners and calenders. :) ). If it DOES mean meds may be an option...Can I suggest they aren&#39;t so bad? I first took them in high school, noticed no ill effects, and the positives were, 1) a more even mood. I couldn&#39;t understand how at times my mood would swing from one extreme to the other.<br/>\n   2) a glimpse into what other people felt. For the first time I could really understand that I had some obstacles that others didn&#39;t. I marveled the first time I could sit down for an hour and study something. THIS was why others did better, not because they were more intelligent.<br/>\n  3) a way around the obstacles. I use Ritalyn on and off now as I feel I need it. When I worked retail there was a horrible time when my cash was always over or short. I was too fast on the register, with the customers and couldn&#39;t make out what individuals steps I needed to take or change to improve. I went in for my prescription and, voila, my brain slowed down, I could work it out and practice and when my small prescription was gone I could carry what I&#39;d learned with me. It was sort of a training device. Not much discussion of using Ritalyn this way (of course, drug companies like to talk about keeping kids on it as much as possible) but I found it worked well for me.<br/>\n  Okay, again, I don&#39;t want you to think that I think your son is ADHD. I just saw some similarities so I thought I&#39;d share if it ever came to that.

Why in the world would he want to have<br/>\neveryone aggravated at him?  I try to put myself in his shoes, what does it<br/>\nfeel like to be Danny?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if I had so many things calling to me that I couldn&#39;t stay focused on<br/>\none thing?  What if I had so much energy that I felt I would crawl out of my<br/>\nskin if I had to sit still one more minute?  What if I couldn&#39;t remember the<br/>\ntopic of the conversation by the time people stopped talking?<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes!  It has to be like bad, bad PMS everyday of your life and then have<br/>\npeople be aggravated at you because you have PMS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found very few things that help Danny.  The biggest is making sure he<br/>\ngets enough rest.  The second is making sure that he has free space to burn<br/>\nenergy, lots of time outside, gymnastics class, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that an important factor is for me to be able to stay connected<br/>\nto Danny in a positive way.  I make sure we have alone time together<br/>\n(because he is lots of fun one-on-one) everyday.  I snuggle with him on the<br/>\ncouch and rub his back.  I breathe in the smell of his hair.  Little things<br/>\nto remind me that I love this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he is having a particularly tough day, I will sometimes suggest to him<br/>\nthat I know he is having a rough day and would he like a backrub.   We go<br/>\noff by ourselves and I give him a backrub or massage with Lavender essential<br/>\noil (lavender is calming) and I talk about when I first met him (he was<br/>\nadopted) and how thrilled we were, and little memories.  It usually moves<br/>\ninto general conversation but it changes the mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure this is Danny and he is going to have to go through the intense<br/>\nemotions, the reactions of others, the sadness and anger no matter what.  He<br/>\ncan either go through it feeling like even his mom doesn&#39;t like him or he<br/>\ncan go through it feeling like his mom would help him if she only knew how.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Genevieve Labont√©&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fihz@...\">fihz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 06, 2004 4:27 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Discipline, frustrations and all that goes<br/>\nwith it<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading you ladies for what, a year and a half now??

I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; explained to him what could happen and let him long enough he has to<br/>\n&gt; explain to a guard who he is and that he&#39;s looking for his parents, but<br/>\n&gt; he just doesn&#39;t get it!  Maybe I don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the whole natural<br/>\n&gt; consequence thing.  I get the main idea, but it seems that when it&#39;s out<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;easy&quot; borders, I just chicken out and can&#39;t let go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I feel like if *I*<br/>\n&gt; do something on my side to ease out his days, he&#39;ll get better and life<br/>\n&gt; too!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is he too big to carry around?<br/>\n&gt; **Unfortunatly, yes, he&#39;s a big 45 lbs.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe he&#39;s resentful of the baby and needs more time with you alone, and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; close.<br/>\n&gt; Will he let you rock him to sleep and hum to him?<br/>\n&gt; ** I often pat his back to sleep, put his little music on, he usually<br/>\n&gt; jumps in our bed by midnight and we let him cuddle with us, but it never<br/>\n&gt; seems enough.<br/>\n&gt; Can you go on slow leisurely walks, just you and him?<br/>\n&gt; ** I can, but I guess I don&#39;t take the option often.  I&#39;m usually alone<br/>\n&gt; with the 4 kids right now, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try more often when<br/>\n&gt; DH is home to take some time together....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;m trying really hard not to &quot;Send him in his room with no<br/>\n&gt; supper&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have you ever sent him to his room with no supper?   Honestly?<br/>\n&gt; NO!!!  I couldn&#39;t do that, but lately, the idea comes up as a &quot;Maybe if<br/>\n&gt; you tried this he&#39;d understand&quot;.  I *know* it wouldn&#39;t work, and I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never done it, it probably comes from friends I know who make their kids<br/>\n&gt; behave with reasonings like these.  The farthest I&#39;ve been is no desert,<br/>\n&gt; usually because he&#39;s goofing around with his food and hasn&#39;t eaten for<br/>\n&gt; like 15 minutes and I know he isn&#39;t hungry.  It&#39;ll usually be a &quot;fruit<br/>\n&gt; or yogourt desert instead of ...&quot; but even then, if I&#39;ve made a special<br/>\n&gt; desert and I know they&#39;re not eating because they know what&#39;s coming, I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t deprive him of it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Because that&#39;s withholding love and food, and neither will ever make a<br/>\n&gt; boy<br/>\n&gt; nicer or calmer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My guess from what you wrote is that you&#39;ve been pushing him away<br/>\n&gt; instead of<br/>\n&gt; drawing him nearer, and that your &quot;natural consequences&quot; haven&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; too<br/>\n&gt; natural.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** That&#39;s what I&#39;m scared of.  I feel like I can&#39;t let go of a lot of<br/>\n&gt; his &quot;goofyness&quot; and it&#39;s making me resentful and all.  I started getting<br/>\n&gt; frustrated about this situation about 6 months ago when we tried to go<br/>\n&gt; camping and on various outings and he&#39;d just be plain dangerous and so<br/>\n&gt; hard to bring around that it&#39;s not worth the outing just because of all<br/>\n&gt; the frustration it brings to everyone else in the family.  I do accept a<br/>\n&gt; lot ( I think so, anyways!) but because of his big ideas, I&#39;m often<br/>\n&gt; scared of letting him go, and I guess he doesn&#39;t like being close to us,<br/>\n&gt; he want&#39;s to explore (which is legitimate) but there&#39;s a security<br/>\n&gt; perimiter (within sight in woods, or even earshot)  in case anything<br/>\n&gt; happens, which he just can&#39;t stand, he&#39;s always pushing the limit, mine,<br/>\n&gt; not his.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for natural consequences, how far do they have to go?? I mean, I have<br/>\n&gt; a problem with letting him burn himself on the campfire, but then again<br/>\n&gt; if it&#39;s what it takes, should it be acceptable?  How about meals? How<br/>\n&gt; much bad manners should be acceptable??  Maybe my &quot;danger zone&quot; is too<br/>\n&gt; fluffy and I should let him bump himself a couple of times??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Writing this, I feel I&#39;m trying to heal the wrong problem.  I&#39;m trying<br/>\n&gt; to make his world better, but not our relationship.  I guess I should<br/>\n&gt; start by trying to be more &quot;in-tune&quot; with HIS needs and try really hard<br/>\n&gt; to satisfy them before trying to solve the other things.  They might go<br/>\n&gt; away on their own with more love and patience towards him instead of<br/>\n&gt; resentfullness<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Genevieve<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; always loved everyone&#39;s great opinions about unschooling, and the whole<br/>\n&gt; life that goes with it.  We&#39;ve been &quot;officially&quot; homeschooling since<br/>\n&gt; September, but haven&#39;t really changed anything, except keep Felix&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; drawings and all in case we get asked about them by the school board.  I<br/>\n&gt; still have some difficulties letting go with bedtimes and mealtimes<br/>\n&gt; (especially this one!) and my major &quot;lost in space&quot; is what to do when<br/>\n&gt; things don&#39;t turn out well...  Let me explain...  My second son<br/>\n&gt; (Jonathan, who&#39;s almost 5 -in Feb-) is very, very  active, disturbing,<br/>\n&gt; Actually, I feel like I&#39;ve failed with him ( I know, very bad feelings<br/>\n&gt; for me AND him, but I&#39;m trying SO HARD it&#39;s frustrating!).  I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; what to do with him anymore, and I&#39;m looking for ideas furthur out of<br/>\n&gt; the box than I can think of right now.  So any suggestion is welcome, it<br/>\n&gt; might lighten a light somewhere in me and eventually get things better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I must say he&#39;s a very active (physically) kid, is very interested in<br/>\n&gt; everything around him, loves to play, is very creative and imaginative,<br/>\n&gt; and if you&#39;re one-on-one with him he&#39;s fun.  BUT and these are what gets<br/>\n&gt; me so dang frustrated about him, he rarely listens to us; doesn&#39;t look<br/>\n&gt; at us when we talk to him and doesn&#39;t have a clue what you were talking<br/>\n&gt; to him about (talk about frustrating!), can&#39;t stay still at the table<br/>\n&gt; with *minimal* manners, is quite agressive with his brothers ( 6 1/2 yo<br/>\n&gt; and 2X 2yo).  We&#39;ve tried natural consequences, to which most don&#39;t work<br/>\n&gt; since he doesn&#39;t care, ignoring bad behaviors and all, and I could add a<br/>\n&gt; big list to all this, and even lots of suggestions I&#39;ve read off here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do try to be easy with him, I tell him wayyyy in advance if we have to<br/>\n&gt; go out and he has to get dressed (step 1 out of his pj&#39;s and step 2 in<br/>\n&gt; his winter coat), I explain to him where we&#39;re going, what we will do<br/>\n&gt; there, and why we HAVE to go today and not later when I can go alone, or<br/>\n&gt; what I expect from him ( no crazy running around the pool, for him to<br/>\n&gt; stay close to us in a crowdy place, etc...)  I don&#39;t think I have to big<br/>\n&gt; demandings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This seems to be turning out as a big frustration about him, but gosh, I<br/>\n&gt; feel like I&#39;m in a dead-end zone, and everyone around me give me<br/>\n&gt; suggestions like, &quot; You should send him to school next year, it&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; easier on you&quot;, or &quot; you should find some medication for him to calm him<br/>\n&gt; down&quot;, or &quot; You should discipline him way more, you&#39;re too easy with<br/>\n&gt; him&quot; etc.. But I don&#39;t feel comfortable with those, I feel like if *I*<br/>\n&gt; do something on my side to ease out his days, he&#39;ll get better and life<br/>\n&gt; too!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I hope I gave enough information, but I&#39;m so frustrated about today&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; outing, that I&#39;m trying really hard not to &quot;Send him in his room with no<br/>\n&gt; supper&quot; and be a little more calm and find what went wrong there<br/>\n&gt; too.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Genevieve, mom to<br/>\n&gt; Felix, 6 ans,<br/>\n&gt; Jonathan, 4 ans,<br/>\n&gt; Xavier et Robin, 2 ans...<br/>\n&gt; Living in outer space, or might I say in Canada :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       Yahoo!
