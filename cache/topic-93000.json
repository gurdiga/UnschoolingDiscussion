I feel very adaptable when it comes to walls standing in my way. I feel like I could help my child make transcripts in any way a college would like and no lie, even if I had to help my child pick her learning apart and put grades on what she knows. Others think this is wrong, and I can understand that, but not everything is so black and white. Life is far from black and white. This is however a topic I know little about and should leave it alone until, or when, it is needed for me to learn more about. My point was to support other parents with children who may want to get into a college that insist on transcripts. I have high hopes that when my little one is ready, if she wants, that it will not be a topic we need to deal with. <br/>\n <br/>\n Second. Goddess do I have a lot of learning to do! I did read REJECTING A PRE-PACKAGED LIFE. So much of it I agree with. Too many people live with the idea of someday. Someday I will be happy when: Fill in the blank, better job, more money, better home, new car, married, kids.... could go on and on. And for a long time I lived like that. It takes work not to, we have been programmed to feel like that and every day we are hit by it sometimes not even knowing it, watching TV, talking to friends, ads online. It is hard to deal with. But I think it is something we learn and I hope to not teach my child that it has to be that way. I think we should be happy. <br/>\n <br/>\n But again, my views on happy are different. I really feel like life is about being useful. It is not opposed to happy. I think that by being useful we are happy. I will strive to explain this more in a different post. <br/>\n <br/>\n Third, thank you for putting up with me. I have a great deal to learn and many ideas to re-think and things to get over. More questions, more reading. <br/>\n <br/>\n   Blessings,<br/>\n    Kimmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~!~!~!~!~Army Wife and Mother~!~!~!~!~!~<br/>\nEnchanted Creations, Candles and beautiful Glass holders.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/2vsgt\">http://tinyurl.com/2vsgt</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHelps Support Homeschooling Family.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe who you are, and say what you feel, because those who mind don&#39;t matter and those who matter don&#39;t mind. - Dr Seuss<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
