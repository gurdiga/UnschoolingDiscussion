I unschool (or, as I prefer to term it, learn naturally)<br/>\nwith my three sons in Indiana.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have compiled a long list of books related to the unschooling concept.<br/>\nThe list can be found at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/heartland/trail/3405/unschoolingbooks.html\">http://www.geocities.com/heartland/trail/3405/unschoolingbooks.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Some of these books are specifically on &quot;how to unschool&quot;, but most of<br/>\nthem are books that expound upon the basic premises of the unschooling<br/>\nway of life.  They are about the celebration and honor of childhood,<br/>\nnon-conformity, self-reliance, self-determination, liberation, trust,<br/>\nnature, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of these books can be found at your library or local bookstore.  I<br/>\nhave each of the books linked to Amazon so you can read the readers&#39;<br/>\nreviews and synopses.  My goal is to get more reviews written from<br/>\nstrictly a homeschooling/unschooling point of view and include the<br/>\nreviews with my list.  So, if you have read any of the books on the<br/>\nlist, I&#39;d appreciate your review.  (I do have David&#39;s book on the list<br/>\nand would love to get your personal review!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps,<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6350,"nextTopicId":6427}}
