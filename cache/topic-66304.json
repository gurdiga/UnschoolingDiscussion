That pushing him will hurt him and <br/>\nthat hurts his feelings. Yours is a bit young for reasoning. I would guess <br/>\nthat she is a bit jealous but what can you do? I often had my husband take <br/>\nCassidy some place special.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Nicholas was nursing I had to sleep with him, he just would not sleep <br/>\nwithout me. When we moved him to his crib I put something that smelled like <br/>\nMommy in there and he was fine after a couple days of reassuring him.  He was <br/>\nalso an almost 10 pound baby smaller than my daughter at 11-9 and I knew his <br/>\nbetween nursing would be almost like hers so if I wanted sleep they had to <br/>\nsleep with me until they where done nursing.  My children, well the last two <br/>\nnursed so much I was told they where using me as a pacifier. They where <br/>\ncontent, I got well needed sleep that&#39;s was important.<br/>\nSorry, im going in to this nursing thing and I dont even know if you are <br/>\nnursing.<br/>\nI will say that when I thought it would never happen it finally did. We where <br/>\nat about 6 months when Nicholas went into his crib at night time.<br/>\nDont worry about what every one else does or says they do that&#39;s why we <br/>\nUnschool right?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\nMaine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66209,"nextTopicId":66180}}
