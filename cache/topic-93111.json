There are constant opportunities for <br/>\ndiscussions of philosophical concepts outside the formal study of philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example from myt house, last night.  I posted it at <br/>\nunschooling.com, but I&#39;ll put it here too:<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Sandra Dodd (Sandradodd) on Thursday, April 29, 2004 - 06:49 pm:<br/>\nthis is hard to convey, because it was quick and sometimes two or three <br/>\npeople were talking at once. Sometimes I couldn&#39;t quote, and there was laughing and <br/>\ngesturing, but here it is for the sake of its punchline: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband brought papers for me to sign. He&#39;s moving my IRA to the Navy <br/>\ncredit union (his dad was a WWII pilot, and his brother was on a submarine years <br/>\nlater) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were talking about insurance policies his dad has for the kids, which are <br/>\npaid for by interest from an IRA that&#39;s in Holly&#39;s name, bought by her <br/>\ngrandparents. Holly wanted us to tell her what we were talking about. I said it would <br/>\nbe enough money if she died that we could bury her and have a party. She <br/>\nacted like that sounded good. I said maybe we could put her out between Purple and <br/>\nLuna (a cat and rat of hers, bothin the flowerbed out back). I said maybe we <br/>\ncould pay the house off with the insurance money so we wouldn&#39;t ever have to <br/>\nsell it and lose Holly&#39;s grave. <br/>\n<br/>\nIllegal to bury her in the yard? Maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested that we could get a stone that says &quot;Luna, beloved rat of Holly,&quot; <br/>\nand underline Holly, so God would know it was actually her. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly said God is a genius and would know anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Why&#39;s God a genius?&quot; Keith asked. He just is. I suggested &quot;butterflies.&quot; <br/>\nHolly concurred. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith said God&#39;s omnipotent, so he knows everything. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill he turn us in to the city? <br/>\nProbably. <br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;That&#39;s omnicient. Omnipotent means he can do anything, all-powerful. <br/>\nAnd (to Holly I said) the question that goes with that is whether God can <br/>\nmake a rock so big that he himself can&#39;t pick it up. If not, he&#39;s not omnipotent. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly, without missing a beat: &quot;I thought the question was whether Jesus <br/>\ncould microwave a burrito so hot that he himself couldn&#39;t eat it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI HOOTED! <br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;Well yes, that&#39;s the same question, updated.

Seamus is surrounded by people <br/>\nwho basically speak well, use proper sentence structure unless we are <br/>\nbeing sloppy on purpose, etc. He seems to always use the right words <br/>\nin the right places. His vocabulary might be somewhat &quot;advanced&quot; for <br/>\nhis age (he will use some really &quot;hard&quot; words when its least <br/>\nexpected), although i am not sure exactly how a 7 yo is supposed to <br/>\ntalk or what &quot;vocabulary&quot; words the typical 7 yo uses. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo i guess my question is, is it important that he know the <br/>\nterminology for stuff he does naturally already? I suppose he might <br/>\nwant to memorize the basics before the SATs, but other than that, is <br/>\nthere anywhere in real life this stuff comes up? I think i explained <br/>\nwhat a &quot;vowel&quot; was to him the other day because it came up in <br/>\nconversation, but usually this kind of stuff doesnt come up. I <br/>\nsuppose i could strew some SchoolHouse Rock (i *still* dont know what <br/>\na conjuction is, nor what its function is)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went garage-saling today and came across a ton of &quot;teaching <br/>\nmaterials&quot;, textbooks, teacher manuals etc. My sister said &quot;This <br/>\nmustve been a homeschooling family&quot; and kept saying i should buy the <br/>\nstuff. Instead i bought a pokemon card tin, some plastic pokemon <br/>\nfigures, a jenga (wooden puzzle thing)game, an unopened box of 600 <br/>\nplastic pieces that you attach pennies to to make structures (can&#39;t <br/>\nremember the name, but seamus loves them and they are expensive in <br/>\nthe store), a bag of glitter, some kids books, some &quot;family fun&quot; <br/>\nmagazines, and some big wooden storage cubes. Ahhhh i love my <br/>\n&quot;unschooling curriculum&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Terminology (was Arm Yourself Against Stupidity!)","postDate":"1082832122","msgId":93119,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWM0MmEyYiRkNjI5MmVjMCQ5ODRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDhlLjkyMzI1NjEuMmRiYWE2YmFAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDAwNzMwMWM0MjlmZSQ5MmE3NWI5MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBrdXNoNjkwMD4="},"prevInTopic":93117,"nextInTopic":93126,"prevInTime":93118,"nextInTime":93120,"topicId":93111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Danielle writes: Here s a question I ve been mulling over for sometime.

Math is natural and fun around our house and doesn&#39;t need any demystifying. Starting to attach labels would add to the confusion here. It would also start cutting math up, making borders my kids might feel aren&#39;t to be crossed. I want them to feel math is as open to exploration and play as the backyard. How I was taught it (or rather not taught it) in school was that it was done this way, studied under these labels and not open to play at all (I remember getting marked down for getting right answers the wrong way). Maybe it&#39;s a different matter if your kids have already been exposed to the terms but here demystifycation isn&#39;t important because it&#39;s never been mystifyed. The labels they can learn when they need to but they don&#39;t need those labels to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was Sandra maybe, or maybe I read it elsewhere, who brought up a story of a mathmatician who if he had kids (or he had kids but decided that if he could do it again) he would not teach them any math. That&#39;s really stuck with me. At least the point of it...every other detail as you can tell is vague. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Terminology (was Arm Yourself Against Stupidity!)","postDate":"1082828597","msgId":93117,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NS4yN2NjMjgxNC4yZGJjMDEzNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93111,"nextInTopic":93119,"prevInTime":93116,"nextInTime":93118,"topicId":93111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/24/04 8:19:46 AM, danielle.conger@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1785978916\">In a message dated 4/24/04 8:19:46 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:danielle.conger@...\">danielle.conger@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Sandra, several times you&#39;ve mentioned avoiding schoolish<br/>\n<br/>\nterminology--mostly math examples like multiplication or geometry, but I&#39;m<br/>\n<br/>\nguessing this would apply to things like simile, alliteration, etc. I&#39;m<br/>\n<br/>\nwondering why you think terminology clutters up the brain. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTerms before examples are confusing static.<br/>\n<br/>\nTerms AFTER examples are just more vocabulary, like &quot;clock&quot; or &quot;dog.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo child who has never seen a dog nor a picture of a dog needs to hear the <br/>\nword &quot;dog.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know the terms<br/>\n<br/>\nare made important by schools and that&#39;s problematic, but isn&#39;t there a way<br/>\n<br/>\nto take the terms out of the school setting and use them in helpful ways?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSure.

If a kid is playing with his own newly-found idea <br/>\nthat superheroes names tend to have same beginning sounds, like Clark Kent <br/>\nand Lois Lane, Peter Parker (what was the guy in Unbreakable?  his name did that <br/>\ntoo), and cartoon characters do too sometimes, like Daffy Duck and Bugs <br/>\nBunny, don&#39;t jump in TOO soon to tell him he&#39;s not the first one to notice that and <br/>\nthat it has a name.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he comes and reports his news to you, say &quot;How cool!&quot; and think of some <br/>\nmore with him.  And then you can say that before rhyming final syllables was the <br/>\ncool things to do in English poetry, what they really liked, the Anglo-Saxons <br/>\nand the Vikings, was alliteration, which is that beginning sounds match.   <br/>\n&quot;Alliteration.&quot;  It&#39;s related to &quot;letter&quot; and &quot;literate&quot; (etymologically <br/>\nspeaking).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could say some or all of that, depending on the person&#39;s other interests <br/>\nor prior knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to bring it up one day cold, and say &quot;Someday you might notice that <br/>\nsometimes a write will choose words that match at the beginning, and you should be <br/>\non the lookout for that, because it might be on a standardized test someday, <br/>\nor you might want to study literature or the history of English, and the word <br/>\nis &#39;alliteration,&#39; so try to remember that,&quot;  you will just be making noise.  <br/>\nAnd really irritating noise.

Because honest <br/>\nto God, they DON&#39;T, outside of school.  I didn&#39;t tell him worms had to do <br/>\nwith surgery.    I didn&#39;t tell him the moon was related to volacnos.  In the life <br/>\nof a five year old child (and anyone else outside of school or a personal <br/>\nphilosophical internal ramble) they aren&#39;t.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAncient Egyptians and 19th century Hawaiians?
