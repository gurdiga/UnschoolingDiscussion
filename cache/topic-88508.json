I just <br/>\nenrolled my husband and son (of course myself) since it&#39;s the same <br/>\nprice even if my husband decides not to. I decided I would like to <br/>\nmake a mini- family vacation out of it. Of course he knows I wanted <br/>\nto go but doesn&#39;t have any idea that I signed him up also LOL.......<br/>\nI also signed up for the whale watch. I wonder if another adult can <br/>\ntake my husbands spot on the whale watch if he really needs to work <br/>\nor doesn&#39;t want to go ?????????<br/>\nWhen I read that it was in SC the last couple of years I figured I <br/>\nshould probably jump @ the chance.<br/>\nSee you all there <br/>\nSonya<br/>\nAttleboro, Mass.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87965,"nextTopicId":88506}}
