I really<br/>\nlike it and remember it when I see all the different<br/>\nsmears in our house. I think of it everytime I open a<br/>\ncloset door or a dresser drawer in my house because<br/>\nevery where there is a place to wrap or attach yarn or<br/>\nribbons they are wrapped attached somehow by my 6yo<br/>\ndd.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nCheck out Yahoo!
