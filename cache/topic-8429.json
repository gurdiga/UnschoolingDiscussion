If the<br/>\n&gt; user does not open (double-click on) the attached file, the worm will<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; run or do any damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it is received via e-mail, the Subject: of the message<br/>\n&gt; is &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot; and the body of the message says<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The name of the attachment is LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs<br/>\n&gt; (which, if the system is configured not to show the<br/>\n&gt; extensions of the files, will look like a TXT file to the<br/>\n&gt; user).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it is received via IRC, it resides in a file named<br/>\n&gt; LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When executed, the worm makes copies of itself under<br/>\n&gt; the names MSKernel32.vbs and LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs<br/>\n&gt; in the Windows System directory and under the name<br/>\n&gt; Win32DLL.vbs in the Windows directory. Then it modifies<br/>\n&gt; the Registry, so that the files Win32DLL.vbs and<br/>\n&gt; MSKernel32.vbs will be executed every time Windows is<br/>\n&gt; started.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then the worm modifies the Registry, changing the<br/>\n&gt; startup page of the Internet Explorer, so that when IE<br/>\n&gt; is started, it will download a file named WIN-BUGSFIX.exe<br/>\n&gt; from one of 4 possible places on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skyinet.net\">http://www.skyinet.net</a><br/>\n&gt; (randomly selected) and the Registry is modified, so<br/>\n&gt; that this file is executed the next time Windows is<br/>\n&gt; started.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then the worm creates an HTML version of itself, in a<br/>\n&gt; file named LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM in the Windows System<br/>\n&gt; directory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Next, the worm starts a copy of Outlook in the<br/>\n&gt; background (only Outlook 98 or 2000 will work - not<br/>\n&gt; Outlook 97 or Outlook Express). It examines all Outlook<br/>\n&gt; Address Books and, if an Outlook Address Book contains<br/>\n&gt; more addresses than the Windows Address Book, the worm<br/>\n&gt; mass-mails itself to all addresses in that Outlook<br/>\n&gt; Address Book. (The worm does NOT mass-mail itself to<br/>\n&gt; any addresses in the Windows Address Book.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally, the worm examines all directories on all hard<br/>\n&gt; and network drives. If a file has one of the following<br/>\n&gt; extensions: VBS, VBE, JS, JSE, CSS, WSH, SCT, HTA, MP2,<br/>\n&gt; MP3, JPG or JPEG the worm overwrites the file with a<br/>\n&gt; copy of itself. If the extension was not VBS or VBE, the<br/>\n&gt; worm adds the extension VBS to the name of the file -<br/>\n&gt; so that, for instance, PICTURE.JPG becomes<br/>\n&gt; PICTURE.JPG.vbs. In case a MP2 or MP3 file was<br/>\n&gt; overwritten, the worm also sets its file attribute to<br/>\n&gt; ReadOnly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If, during this directory traversal, any of the following<br/>\n&gt; files is found: mirc32.exe, mlink32.exe, mirc.ini,<br/>\n&gt; script.ini or mirc.hlp, the worm drops in that directory<br/>\n&gt; a file named SCRIPT.INI which begins with the comments<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ;mIRC Script<br/>\n&gt; ;  Please dont edit this script... mIRC will corrupt, if mIRC will<br/>\n&gt;       corrupt... WINDOWS will affect and will not run correctly. thanks<br/>\n&gt; ;<br/>\n&gt; ;Khaled Mardam-Bey<br/>\n&gt; ;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mirc.com\">http://www.mirc.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This file tries to send the file LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.HTM<br/>\n&gt; from the Windows System directory via IRC&#39;s command /DCC<br/>\n&gt; to all users joining the IRC channel which the infected<br/>\n&gt; user is on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The worm sets or modifies the following Registry keys:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HKEY_CURRENT_USER&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows Scripting<br/>\n&gt; Host&#92;Settings&#92;Timeout<br/>\n&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;Run&#92;MSKernel32<br/>\n&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;RunServices&#92;Win<br/>\n&gt; 32DLL<br/>\n&gt; HKEY_CURRENT_USER&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Internet Explorer&#92;Download<br/>\n&gt; Directory<br/>\n&gt; HKEY_CURRENT_USER&#92;Software&#92;Microsoft&#92;Internet Explorer&#92;Main&#92;Start Page<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The file WIN-BUGSFIX.exe is a Backdoor created in the<br/>\n&gt; Phillippines which collects the network passwords cached<br/>\n&gt; by Windows and sends them to an attacker&#39;s site when the<br/>\n&gt; infected user connects to the Internet.<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Fridrik Skulason      Frisk Software International     phone:<br/>\n&gt; +354-5-617273<br/>\n&gt; Author of F-PROT      E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:frisk@...\">frisk@...</a>         fax:<br/>\n&gt; +354-5-617274<br/>\n&gt; Barb Baxter<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8426,"nextTopicId":8435}}
