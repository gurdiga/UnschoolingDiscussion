Our results suggest that stress<br/>\nmay be one of the factors related to the development of CFS.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------<br/>\n1. Body heals within outwards e.g. asthma improves so excema comes out<br/>\n2. Dis-ease symptoms improve head down - Physical e.g. excema improves at <br/>\nhead first then moves down to feet. Mental - feel better<br/>\n3. From major organs to lesser. So skin becomes the saviour of the internal <br/>\norgans. It takes on the reaction rather than perhaps the lungs which may <br/>\nbecome damaged if too much stress is put on them.<br/>\n4. Retrace dis-ease back to starting point. Symptoms disappear or reappear to <br/>\ntheir first appearance. [e.g. asthma after childhood excema] Sometimes one <br/>\nmust go back to a childhood experience or trauma.<br/>\n--------------<br/>\nNot a quote, Sandra: <br/>\nOn supplements there&#39;s a fair amount of commentary too: <br/>\n &quot;many people suffering from eczema often have an essential fatty acid <br/>\ndeficiency,&quot;<br/>\nand zinc was discussed (internal, although topical used to be the favored <br/>\ntreatment years ago and cortizone is more common now).<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a new age page:<br/>\n<br/>\nReiki is also of great assistance for skin disorders especially when the <br/>\nperson is under a great deal of stress.  Reiki assists when there is a <br/>\ndigestive/elimination disorder by allowing the person to once again confront <br/>\nissues/feelings they may have been, or are experiencing.  For instance if our <br/>\ndigestive/elimination system is not working efficiently this can affect our <br/>\noverall health – including the skin.  We digest our emotions as well as our <br/>\nfood!  Likewise constipation can be a result of emotionally not letting go. <br/>\n<br/>\nEczema can be a result of irritation the person is feeling – perhaps to <br/>\nanother, yet they have not expressed this feeling.  Acne indicates feelings <br/>\nof shame, fear, or strong feelings that are not expressed – trying to get <br/>\nout.  Those people who are very sensitive by nature can often have sensitive <br/>\nskins. <br/>\n____________<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in families in which stress from school or other factors has kids keyed <br/>\nup, adding stress about the symptoms won&#39;t help.  I was blamed for my excema, <br/>\nand was limited in foods (it never helped once, but my mom followed doctor&#39;s <br/>\norders anyway without any evidence of success), in what I could wear (which <br/>\nis fine--cotton instead of the then-popular nylon), in what I could take a <br/>\nbath in (bath oil instead of soap, which is comfortable but not all that <br/>\nhelpful with skin problems in the desert!!).  Being told if I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nscratch it it would go away never helped.  It was as if I was allergic to my <br/>\nown sweat when I was stressed, and the stresses in my life caused sweatiness, <br/>\nand I&#39;d break out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDietary considerations are great as concerns general health and digestion, <br/>\nbut just to identify a culprit and eliminate it completely and dramatically <br/>\nas though it&#39;s the one magic switch is not the same as general health, and I <br/>\nknow this from experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I moved away from my parents, I rarely had excema again (finals time at <br/>\ncollege would trigger it).  So either I grew out of it or I moved away from <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of my kids have had any.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27726,"nextTopicId":27719}}
