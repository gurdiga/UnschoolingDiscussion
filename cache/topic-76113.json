They&#39;ve found a place to buy, very nearby and will be moving out gradually, beginning (I think) in November.  They want to paint and fix some things, and it&#39;s only 1/3 of a mile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boundaries can&#39;t help but blur when a family is living with another family, especially with a parent, in a home that&#39;s not theirs.   We&#39;ve had a few incidents here.  I learned to try to go emotionally and verbally limp—not to engage, let it go.  It&#39;s got to be harder for them than it is for me and Keith, them living here.  Kirby&#39;s been away from home since he turned 21, and to come back and have me seeing how he&#39;s doing things, and when and where, and his little failings, and his successes—that&#39;s all apart from him trying to make sure his partner is comfortable.  Over all, we&#39;re doing well, but some of it&#39;s hard, and unexpectedly and suddenly something awkward can arise.  I hide out in other parts of the house sometimes, to give them more space, and to avoid expressing any opinion even subtly.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery morning I take Devyn to school.   The last time I dealt with school in this way, my thirteen-year-old half brother was living with us and going to midschool.   Kirby and Destiny work at 5:00 a.m. and pick her up after school and do all the homework and maintenance and clothing and backpack prep.  I just wake her up, hang out a bit, and drive her over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get opinions bubbling up all the time, and I&#39;m not even a real grandmother.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;ve bought her some cute leggings and a pair of shoes, a stylin&#39; little sweatshirt-jacket, and I try to deliver her in a good mood, early enough to play on the playground before the bell—her morning goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they&#39;re all moved, in a few months, I&#39;ll still be the school delivery person, but there won&#39;t be so much mess or crowdedness, and everyone will have more privacy, and I&#39;m glad of the luxury of their good jobs and ability to take care of each other.  I&#39;m glad a family Kirby impressed as a teen likes him enough still to offer him a great deal on buying a house that&#39;s been in their family. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing for me, I think, is to maintain trust and peace.  They want me to help them, not to own and operate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"","from":"Sandra@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Grandparenting","postDate":"1441767623","msgId":76160,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG1zbzdjNytnaGVzbGdAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ5QkFGM0JDLTZCMjUtNENDMy05MTEwLTdFNzJDMTEzQzlEREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEE2MEQ4MDYxLTdGRTQtNEJGOC1BMDY1LTYxNzhFRkU2OTc5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDEwOTY2Mzg5NjcuMTI2OTIzOC4xNDQxNDAyMTU3MzQxLkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPgk8RDlCQUYzQkMtNkIyNS00Q0MzLTkxMTAtN0U3MkMxMTNDOUREQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76152,"nextInTopic":76161,"prevInTime":76159,"nextInTime":76161,"topicId":76113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I meant Cool clothes but this typo makes it all wrong.

id=\"ygrps-yiv-283820138\">-=-Yes I didn&#39;t really mean unschooling her but using the principles of unschooling  one of which I see as fully trusting her instead of worrying about her and trying to control things.  I think that way I will be free and peaceful to be inspirational and fun. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat already has a name, though:  Detachment.<br/>\nThat&#39;s the avoidance of co-dependency, in which your happiness depends on her &quot;happiness&quot; [by your own definition of happiness].<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- the principles of unschooling  one of which I see as fully trusting her-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see that as a principle of unschooling, especially as regards the mother of another human being.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith children, when parents are deschooling and learning about natural learning, &quot;trust&quot; comes up, but it&#39;s clearer and more helpful to think of it as trusting that children want to learn, that children can and DO learn, if not thwarted.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the time someone is grown and working and busy and having children, they might not be in the want-to-learn mode that young children of happy and hopeful parents are. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do agree with the overall statement, and trusting that you will make things worse with pressure is a good thought.  If you&#39;re &quot;trusting&quot; that your daughter will come to unschooling, she might not.  Most people don&#39;t, and even a fair percentage of those who want to and try to don&#39;t loose their grip on enough other things to let it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to be discouraging of your vision, but of the idea that what a grandparent wants is a goal to cling to.  Sometimes the best thing to do might be to buy the child some sool clothes and take him or her somewhere fun to wear them.  A level back from direct decisions about everyday life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336961538,"authorName":"Belinda Aycrigg","from":"Belinda Aycrigg &lt;bhakti@...&gt;","profile":"bhakti@xtra.co.nz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Grandparenting","postDate":"1441402157","msgId":76151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwOTY2Mzg5NjcuMTI2OTIzOC4xNDQxNDAyMTU3MzQxLkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEE2MEQ4MDYxLTdGRTQtNEJGOC1BMDY1LTYxNzhFRkU2OTc5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEE2MEQ4MDYxLTdGRTQtNEJGOC1BMDY1LTYxNzhFRkU2OTc5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76150,"nextInTopic":76152,"prevInTime":76150,"nextInTime":76152,"topicId":76113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes I didn t really mean unschooling her but using the principles of unschooling  one of which I see as fully trusting her instead of worrying about her and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-128837097\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-128837097ygrps-yiv-729691418\"><div style=\"color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, Sans-Serif;font-size:14px;\">Yes I didn&#39;t really mean unschooling her but using the principles of unschooling  one of which I see as fully trusting her instead of worrying about her and trying to control things.  I think that way I will be free and peaceful to be inspirational and fun. <br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-128837097ygrps-yiv-729691418yui_3_16_0_1_1441401167216_6131\"><span></span></div>  <br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-128837097ygrps-yiv-729691418qtdSeparateBR\"><br><br></div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Grandparenting","postDate":"1441241399","msgId":76150,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2MEQ4MDYxLTdGRTQtNEJGOC1BMDY1LTYxNzhFRkU2OTc5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExRTdFRDVDLUI2OEEtNDU4OC04ODU3LUZEMTI0NkRGQURGMkBiaWdwb25kLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0MzM3MTYzMDkuMTg4NzM0MC4xNDQwOTIxOTM2ODM3LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTFFN0VENUMtQjY4QS00NTg4LTg4NTctRkQxMjQ2REZBREYyQGJpZ3BvbmQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76148,"nextInTopic":76151,"prevInTime":76149,"nextInTime":76151,"topicId":76113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- ...

Sticky foods that don&#39;t dissolve -- like raisins -- can cause decay but that&#39;s easily solved by eating other foods that wash them away like hard cheeses. That&#39;s just one of the many ideas gathered on that page.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect what&#39;s causing the most problems is that she lacks confidence in any approach. She keeps controlling food because it&#39;s what everyone does. But she doesn&#39;t feel right about it and lacks confidence that it will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336961538,"authorName":"Belinda Aycrigg","from":"Belinda Aycrigg &lt;bhakti@...&gt;","profile":"bhakti@xtra.co.nz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Grandparenting","postDate":"1440921936","msgId":76113,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MzM3MTYzMDkuMTg4NzM0MC4xNDQwOTIxOTM2ODM3LkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76114,"prevInTime":76112,"nextInTime":76114,"topicId":76113,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Everybody I have been reading your wonderful posts for about 2 years now and appreciating them.
