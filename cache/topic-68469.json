We where there for two hours it was heaven.  <br/>\nHe picked up a couple books and I bought an older John Holt book because they <br/>\nstill do not have the new one.

Dahh, just order the stupid book you <br/>\nmight make some money if it is instock......<br/>\nSo then Dustin and I sat and had a capachino, it was so great that we could <br/>\njust sit there and talk about our books.<br/>\nWe swung into the kids section and a lady that worked there was listening to <br/>\nus and wanted to suggest a book. She said to Dustin &quot;what grade are you in?&quot; <br/>\nAhhh, Ahhh Ahh, he says.

I have this fear that if I just let them do what <br/>\nthey want, I will be missing out on all those teachable moments.  I <br/>\nam still having trouble translating all this into life.  I always <br/>\nfeel like I should be reading to them, taking them places, playing <br/>\ngames?  I am not sure how much *me* time or their *own* time they <br/>\nneed.  My kids are pretty independent and play well together, so <br/>\nsometimes I feel like it is too easy to not be an active  *part* of <br/>\ntheir day.  Should I be making an effort to get more involved or let <br/>\nthem be??<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68417,"nextTopicId":68754}}
