Sorry to mislead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that why you thought there was a &quot;disconnect&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree Sandra, it is very interesting.  I waited this long to share<br/>\nthe story because I didn&#39;t know it was going to last long enough<br/>\nto have a story to tell.<br/>\nTo answer your questions:<br/>\nShe is an only child, never attended school before 1st grade, age 7.<br/>\nWe did not do any curriculum or &quot;educational&quot; study.<br/>\nOur days closely related the ones that you and others described on this<br/>\nboard.<br/>\nTV, legos, drawing, cards, acting....<br/>\n<br/>\nOther info: She has an equal amount of homeschooling friends and<br/>\nschool friends and plays with friends from both at least once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she started the semester she always wanted to be there even<br/>\ngetting there early and staying late for other activities they offered.<br/>\nA day lasted 7:30 AM to 6 PM.  Burned herself out in about two months.<br/>\nNow she is there from 8:15 AM to 2 PM. Lately she has taken off a few<br/>\nhours or a day or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not going to predict the outcome because as everyone has said to me<br/>\nabout her attending school  &quot;HUH??!! she would have been the last kid I<br/>\never<br/>\nthought would want to go to school!!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes her decision sometimes worry me? Sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If she wants to quit, she knows she can. If she wanted to see how a<br/>\nfarm works, I would arrange for a farm stay, I don&#39;t see this as any<br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting for the mom to identify as an unschooler and for the<br/>\nchild<br/>\nto have gone to school day 1 of first grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe analogy of visiting a farm is interesting, but she seems to have<br/>\ngone to<br/>\nlive at the farm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand the philosophical basis, but there really is a<br/>\ndisconnect if<br/>\na person&#39;s kid is in school!  Aleksi, do you have other school age<br/>\nchildren<br/>\nnot in school?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;By the way, she was 7 yrs and 2 months  old when she started 1st grade<br/>\nin September.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had been homeschooled for a couple of years and wanted to try first<br/>\ngrade?<br/>\nReally interesting!<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58166,"nextTopicId":58185}}
