It&#39;s pretty interesting to<br/>\n  listen to them sometimes. Sometimes though they get into these<br/>\n  conversations where they seem to be trying to prove how smart they are.<br/>\n  They talk in big words and such. Being the smart alec I am I often stop<br/>\n  them and ask them what the heck this or that means - and the one thing<br/>\n  I&#39;ve found is sometimes they&#39;re full of it! They make up words and BS<br/>\n  their way through many many conversations! I don&#39;t suppose all PhD&#39;s are<br/>\n  like that - but it&#39;s fun to run into the ones who are and to blow up<br/>\n  their persona of genius they&#39;re trying to portray.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Your friend is full of stereotypes, isn&#39;t he?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  But he has a PhD so he Must Be Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
