They have tons of money that is not bound by federal regulations  about <br/>\nincome to give away.  You need not always be an A student or a  athlete to get <br/>\nthis funds.  Always talk to the financial aid officer, even  after you get your <br/>\naward letter, there is almost always extra money lingering  around and they <br/>\ndecide who it goes to.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest went to a private college in NC, out of state for us.   Tuition, <br/>\nroom and board nears 30,000 per year.  She was there four years  and a summer <br/>\nsemester.  We paid about six thousand dollars out of pocket  (mostly for the <br/>\nsummer semester) and she had about four thousand in loans.   The rest was paid by <br/>\nprivate scholarships and grants.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve recommended this to other parents who felt panicked that their child  <br/>\nwanted to head off to college and they had not financially prepared, it has  <br/>\nalways helped greatly.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe got the original award letter and I called the financial aide office  just <br/>\nto ask some questions.  How much did they think books average?   (it had been <br/>\nmany years since I was in college)  How much do they figure an  away from <br/>\nhome student might need to live on?<br/>\n <br/>\nI asked LOTS of questions.  I finally just said to him that I was  trying to <br/>\nbe prepared.  We wanted to give Sarah this opportunity that she  wanted but I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t willing for the rest of us to sit in the dark and eat peanut  butter <br/>\nsandwiches for four years to make it happen.  I wanted to know the  approximate <br/>\nmonthly amount I would have to budget for her to be there.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe laughed and said he&#39;d never heard it put quite that way.  He&#39;d see  what <br/>\nhe could do and send me a letter in a week.  Her first year, he came  up with <br/>\nus paying $1,000.00.  Not bad at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I would add to not rule out private colleges because they seem so  <br/>\nexpensive.  I would have paid more for her to go three years to a community  college <br/>\nin state and it would not have been the experience that she was looking  for. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":134300842,"authorName":"Brenda Rose","from":"&quot;Brenda Rose&quot; &lt;rosebl@...&gt;","profile":"homeanduva2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kirby-taking-classes update","postDate":"1109770868","msgId":104071,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMGMwMWM1MWYyZCQ3ZGNhMzM4MCQ2ODAxYThjMEBCcmVuZGE+","referencesHeader":"PDExMDk3Mzc3MzEuMjY0My40Mjk1My5tMTRAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104069,"nextInTopic":104084,"prevInTime":104070,"nextInTime":104072,"topicId":103626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Congratulations to Kirby thus far!

This is the first year we had  planned to <br/>\nuse any of the e-bonds (savings bonds tax free if you use them for  education) <br/>\nbut this year because I got a settlement from the insurance company  of the <br/>\nhotel where I broke my leg, that added enough to our income that we would  have <br/>\nhad to pay taxes on the bonds had we cashed any anyway.   Other  years it <br/>\nwon&#39;t matter.  So for people with high incomes ordinarily, no  matter what their <br/>\nexpenses are, the tax advantage might fade away with those  bonds.  When we <br/>\nfirst bought some we were quite poor.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne good thing about those I didn&#39;t know when we first got them is that it  <br/>\ncould be me or Keith using them on education, too.  So if I talk all my  kids <br/>\nout of wanting any college, I can go back and get a master&#39;s in a few  years.  <br/>\n(JOKING...  mostly.)<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Kirby-taking-classes update","postDate":"1109732920","msgId":104066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZWE3Njg0OWEzMDE3YTY3NDFlMjY1ODc3MTM5ZmNhQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTYwMWM1MWU4OCQ1Zjg5ZDA2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQwMjlocStxM2V1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDAxNjAxYzUxZTg4JDVmODlkMDYwJDY0MDFhOGMwQGhvbWU+"},"prevInTopic":104059,"nextInTopic":104067,"prevInTime":104065,"nextInTime":104067,"topicId":103626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The other one isn&#39;t a graded situation (the college success class) but he loves it.  They talk about deciding how much value an activity will have to them, and how much time to invest in it.  &quot;Is this a piano?&quot; was one of the principles.  He said they said some things just aren&#39;t a piano.  I was puzzled at first, but he said if you&#39;ve worked for an hour and gotten 90% of what you need to do, is it worth another hour to get the remaining 10% of improvement?   Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a lifelong perfectionist, I immediately see it as sloth. &lt;bwg&gt;  And yet I play Neopets every day instead of writing a book.  Could I do 90% of the book I envision?  Apparently not. &lt;g&gt;  But Kirby is pretty easily happy with 90% already, and now someone has reinforced that, which I think is pretty cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the other day they did a(nother) learning styles profile and Kirby was shown to be someone who learns musically.  He said his response to that was &quot;Schoolhouse Rock rocks!&quot; (and showed me with gestures)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\nNo English 101 on the table at the moment<br/>\nB thusfar in math 99<br/>\nhappy-happy in College Success<br/>\n<br/>\nSaid he&#39;d like to go some more in fall, but will only take things that won&#39;t be harshly affected by taking time off to go to the Live & Learn conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104076,"nextTopicId":104089}}
