Delegate and select mentors from unlikely sources -- past co-workers, friends, family, neighbors to share what they enjoy with your child -- it takes you out of the picture for a bit and widens their scope of life and all it has to offer...-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t think it&#39;s limited to just our kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Cameron was intersted in magic, I purposefully went in search of magicians to act as mentors for him. Some of these people have become very god friends of our family---Christian Thee and John Tudor and Jeff McBride. They have widened not just Camerons&#39; world, but mine and Ben&#39;s and Duncan&#39;s as well---not to mention other friends we&#39;ve introduced them to. It&#39;s that ripple effect!<br/>\n<br/>\nHis interest in music led us to get more involved with Skip Pearson, who invites Cam to play jazz with his band on Thursday nights. Duncan is good friends with Skip&#39;s grandson, CJ. Cameron met Julie and Danny while playing with Skip----it doesn&#39;t *just* touch one person when we let these others into our children&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may go to Africa with a group of drummers who do some humanitarian work over there---can you imagine what that experience would bring to all our lives???<br/>\n<br/>\nFilming? That avenue is just being skimmed! We&#39;re still meeting producers and camera operators and lighting guys----the list goes on and on! <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can open many doors, since so many doors are available! Our kids aren&#39;t stuck in a building for their entire childhoods! They are out IN the world looking for colorful doors! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104376,"nextTopicId":104062}}
