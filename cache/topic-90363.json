I was in the advanced classes <br/>\nin HS.  In my english classes, we had to read 3 books during the <br/>\nsummer and write reports on them.  Most of the kids would skim the <br/>\nbooks and turn in a basic report.  Not me, I loved to read anyway <br/>\nso, I read the books, enjoyed them, and would turn in these really <br/>\ndetailed long reports.  I would stay after school or class and <br/>\ndiscuss my thoughts about the books with my teachers.  When I was in <br/>\nthe 11th grade, we were assigned a book that I had already read.  <br/>\nWhen I told my teacher that I had already read it, he told me to <br/>\npick any other book by that same author and do the report on that <br/>\none.  He even let me leave class and read the book while they were <br/>\ndiscussing the one that I had already read.  I did the report, <br/>\nturned it in and discussed it with him after class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m not really sure what my point was.  :)  Except that my <br/>\nteachers tended to leave me alone and lot (knowing that I would get <br/>\nthe work done).  As a result, I really learned the subject instead <br/>\nof learing for the test and then forgetting it (like most the kids <br/>\nin my classes did).<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: question about how people learn about unschoo...","postDate":"1076185625","msgId":90469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMwM2htcCt0ZDRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhkLjJkMDM2YTIuMmQ1NjlmZGZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":90466,"nextInTopic":90477,"prevInTime":90468,"nextInTime":90470,"topicId":90363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This was somebody wondering <br/>\nabout how people learn - noticing the phenomenon of people saying <br/>\nthey&#39;d read a lot and yet asking basic questions that it seems they <br/>\nwould have learned from their reading. It happens frequently. It is <br/>\ninteresting to think about why it happens. It doesn&#39;t mean that us <br/>\n&quot;oldtimers&quot; are burned out and resentful and sending newbies away.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was probably MY post! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI DID burn out and go away!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m back! &lt;G&gt; Maybe I should have waited! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen others come and go these last few years. We have a lot of &quot;new <br/>\nexperienced&quot; unschoolers right now giving out good advice. I&#39;m glad. I enjoyed <br/>\nwatching them as I shut up for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original letter that Sandra posted WAS saying that it can be frustrating <br/>\nto watch the same questions be asked again and again after the newbies have <br/>\nalready said they&#39;ve read and read. Then I went on *my* tirade! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS an interesting phenomenon: why do people feel that they need to repeat <br/>\na common question? The original thoughts were laziness and ....what? I can&#39;t <br/>\nremember. <br/>\n<br/>\nLooked it up:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some claim to have done LOTS of reading, but then still ask a repeat <br/>\nquestion.  So, do you think this is due to laziness and they were lying about <br/>\ndoing a <br/>\nlot of reading, or are some people simply unable to relate to what&#39;s being <br/>\nsaid unless it&#39;s said directly to them?  I know these aren&#39;t the only two <br/>\npossibilities, but they seem the most likely to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they&#39;re just products of the school system and can&#39;t seem to gather the <br/>\ninfo any other way. Direct questioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an unschooler, I prefer to go straight to the source. So I understand that <br/>\npart. And like many of my school classmates, I didn&#39;t want to be laughed at <br/>\nif I asked a &quot;stupid question&quot;. So maybe *I* had no problem reading the entire <br/>\nunschooling.comedy message boards for three months (and keeping up on all new <br/>\nmessages) before I posted my first word! (I remember what it was, too! It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t all that bright! &lt;G&gt; But I understood it by then!) <br/>\n<br/>\nI was always in awe of my friend, George, who would ask *anything*---no <br/>\nmatter HOW stupid----if he didn&#39;t understand it! Frequently, it was the same <br/>\nquestion I was thinking about but was afraid to ask. But I just figured I could look <br/>\nit up later. George had the balls (well, yeah!) to ask then and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe it has to do with (yikes!) school and how we felt about asking for <br/>\nhelp---or with our personalities. It takes a lot for me to ask a question that <br/>\nI could look up on my own. So if I ask something---just know I&#39;m SWEATING it <br/>\nout as I type! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: question about how people learn about unschoo...","postDate":"1076093437","msgId":90363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyLjJiYWRjN2UuMmQ1NTNiZmRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":90425,"prevInTime":90362,"nextInTime":90364,"topicId":90363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/6/2004 1:44:19 PM Eastern Standard Time, tjreynoso@yahoo.com writes: Maybe you could think of all those repeated questions as training for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1388828279\">In a message dated 2/6/2004 1:44:19 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tjreynoso@...\">tjreynoso@...</a> writes:<br/>\nMaybe you could think of all those repeated questions as training <br/>\nfor new &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers.
