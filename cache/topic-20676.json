Spanking is one<br/>\nof those issues I feel compelled to respond to and am working on making<br/>\nthem more concise.  I know this is redundant to many but in consideration<br/>\nof the possible benefit to kids I continue to discuss the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese verses are in response to those from the OT on using physical<br/>\ndiscipline.<br/>\n<br/>\n(John 15:15)  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth<br/>\n<br/>\n  not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for <br/>\n  all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known <br/>\n  unto you. <br/>\n<br/>\n(GALAT 2:21)  I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness<br/>\ncome <br/>\n  by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. <br/>\n   (GALAT 3:1)  O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye<br/>\nshould <br/>\n  not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been <br/>\n  evidently set forth, crucified among you? <br/>\n   (GALAT 3:2)  This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by<br/>\nthe <br/>\n  works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? <br/>\n   (GALAT 3:3)  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now<br/>\nmade <br/>\n  perfect by the flesh? <br/>\n<br/>\n(GALAT 3:10)  For as many as are of the works of the law are under the <br/>\n  curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth <br/>\n  not in all things which are written in the book of the law to <br/>\n  do them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could quote much more but I believe Jesus made it abundantly clear that<br/>\nHe intended to establish a new relationship with us.  There is a balance<br/>\nin scripture and our &quot;friendship&quot; with God demands that we live by faith.<br/>\n Anyone who knows scripture also knows that there is MUCH from the Old<br/>\nTestament which most Christians do not practice and we are cautioned<br/>\nabout trying to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, all scripture is profitable but we also have direct guidance and<br/>\ncommon sense.  Again, I ask (even plead) if a child can be raised without<br/>\nspanking why do it?  Is it really about whether spanking will cause<br/>\ndamage?  What does spanking gain?  It gains an immediate response, so<br/>\nwould a LOT of unacceptable methods.  Compliance out of fear is not<br/>\ncooperation which should be the goal.  Violence against loved ones, at<br/>\nthe least, is wrong and that should include children.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving met MANY wonderful and productive people who were never struck as<br/>\nchildren it is clear, to me, that it&#39;s use is NOT needed to attain this<br/>\nend.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
