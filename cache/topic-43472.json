My older son, who is normally *very* patient with his <br/>\nyounger brother, has even gotten irritated with him lately.

If someone asked me if I &quot;monitored&quot; my kids <br/>\neating, for example, I&#39;d say no. But am I with them and aware of what they&#39;re <br/>\neating and do I fix them good nutritious foods and notice if they&#39;ve eaten <br/>\njunky food all day and are getting cranky maybe because of it and do I <br/>\nintroduce them to interesting new foods just for the fun of it and so on? <br/>\nYes. But I would never have thought to call all that: &quot;monitoring their <br/>\nfood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - the use of the term may or may not mean anything about how the person <br/>\nusing it is really interacting with their kids -- but the fact that a bunch <br/>\nof unschoolers responded to it in a certain way might encourage the original <br/>\nuser of the word to reconsider whether &quot;monitoring&quot; is really something they <br/>\nwant to be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, I still keep up with what my 18 yo is doing. If I don&#39;t hear from her <br/>\nall day long - she&#39;s off with friends and stuff - I call her cell phone and <br/>\njust say, &quot;Hi -- how are you doing?&quot; She&#39;s agreeable and happy to talk to me <br/>\n-- &quot;Hi, Mom -- we&#39;re down at the beach and so-and-so has his guitar and it is <br/>\nbeautiful down here.&quot; OR &quot;I&#39;m miserable and I hate my life and I have nothing <br/>\nto do and soandso and I are just bored to tears.&quot; Or whatever -- (this is a <br/>\nkid with big mood swings). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I thought of that as &quot;monitoring&quot; what she was doing, if that came <br/>\nacross to her, she&#39;d be appalled - I don&#39;t think of it that way at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be useful to think about &quot;monitoring&quot; a teenager as something they&#39;d <br/>\nresent.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it as the point of view of the parent of two teens. &quot;Monitoring&quot; would <br/>\nnot go over well with my independent unschooled kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNot speaking officially for: <br/>\nThe National Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2349","postDate":"1031594037","msgId":43472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY0LjI0ZTZhOTI0LjJhYWUzYTM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43480,"prevInTime":43471,"nextInTime":43473,"topicId":43472,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/9/2002 9:24:01 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...
