Why wouldn&#39;t I allow my child the<br/>\nsame fun.  There is just something about finger<br/>\npainting or play dough or cooking that kids love and I<br/>\nthink it is the mess.  I had a neighbor once whose<br/>\nchildren were bathed after every meal.  The poor<br/>\nlittle boy squatted to play in the dirt so he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nget messy.  And she brought me over swim trunks for my<br/>\n15 mth old son because he was swimming in his little<br/>\nwading pool naked.  I guess she thought we couldn&#39;t<br/>\nafford a suit.  His diaper had gotten soaked and we<br/>\njust took it off.  Why can&#39;t kids just enjoy being<br/>\nmessy once in awhile? I guarantee that for the most<br/>\npart it is for our own convenience.
