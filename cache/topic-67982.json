He has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with many psychological components. He is a very good reader/decoder (college level - lower comprehension about 3rd-4th grade). With repetition can do basic math. Has many interests but does not stick with anything long enough to really grasp it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have home schooled him most of his life (now almost 14). He is not able to function in public school setting. Because of my health, he has had a home teacher 3 days a week this past year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really like to Unschool him but turning him lose without structure is like turning a tornado lose in the house. He loves using the computer but not for writing. He loves to read, but, never finishes anything. He has an &quot;ear&quot; for music and picks up melodies and can pick them out on the keyboard quickly, but has not been into that much for quite a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe loves taking electronics apart - even if we&#39;re still using them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe seems to have many interests but not focused enough to profit from any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLynn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67876,"nextTopicId":67921}}
