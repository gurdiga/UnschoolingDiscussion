They exist because the teachers want a<br/>\nbreak from our bratty, berserk, annoying kids -- but the problem is, we<br/>\nparents do too, and we&#39;re paying major bucks for it in the form of either<br/>\ntaxes or tuition. We&#39;re the employers here, yet the employees get to<br/>\nset the<br/>\nschedule in another reverse twist from most professions, and we&#39;re<br/>\nsupposed<br/>\nto just go along with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only people who really benefit from teacher workdays are the teachers,<br/>\nnatch, and the students who get to sleep in. For many households, what<br/>\nto do<br/>\nwith the kids is a major hassle, and often the solution seems to be to<br/>\neither leave them home alone and pray this isn&#39;t the day they discover<br/>\nmatches or porn sites, or just drag them along on the job. If you look<br/>\naround on teacher workdays you&#39;ll see little girls hanging out in the<br/>\ngrocery store aisles while their fathers stock the shelves and guys<br/>\nslumped<br/>\nover Game Boys behind their mothers&#39; desks. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sue<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Public School Horror<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By Jen Garrison Stuber (playing off Quinn Cotton&#39;s original--which was<br/>\n&gt; every bit as ignorant)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You know how there are fascist states throughout the world?
