Quite often the abused child will staunchly defend the <br/>\nabusive parent.  Had I seen/felt anything that told me the children in my <br/>\nexample were having difficulties with their parents&#39; style of discipline, I <br/>\nwould have spoken up.  The children are now adults and I still get no sense <br/>\nof them having been traumatized by the discipline methods of their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was/is not a style I&#39;m comfortable with and not one I adopted.  I have <br/>\ntalked with my oldest child.  We did use spankings with him when we could <br/>\nthink of nothing else.  When I have talked with him about it, I&#39;ve made a <br/>\npoint of listening not only with my ears, but with my heart and gut.  It has <br/>\nnot caused him ongoing trauma.  To decide that spanking will automatically <br/>\ncause ongoing angst is simply not a given.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease try to keep in mind that I&#39;m coming from this with a viewpoint of <br/>\nbeing a child abuse survivor.  Believe it or not, I&#39;m a strong advocate for <br/>\nthe needs of children and do lots of volunteer work with children.  I have <br/>\nlots of personal experience and have done a great deal of study (some formal <br/>\nand lots informally) in this area.  I abhor domestic violence.  I have <br/>\npersonally intervened with family members and others helping put a stop to <br/>\nabusive situations in and out of my extended family.  However, I do not think <br/>\nspanking is automatically battering or a form of child abuse.  Many disagree <br/>\nwith me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big problem with trying to legislate, mandate or dictate one set of child <br/>\nabuse symptoms is that we are individuals.  What affects one person one way <br/>\naffects another in an entirely different way.  For example, in my opening <br/>\nparagraph, every symptom listed could indicate a very troubled child.  OTOH <br/>\nevery symptom could equally mean a difference in personality or some innocent <br/>\nneed.  I think that&#39;s where CPS has run into such problems.  In order to try <br/>\nto help the children that truly need help/rescuing a set of guidelines are <br/>\nestablished which then lead to a set of rules that are adopted which then <br/>\nbecome THE standard without any means to check whether THE standard fits this <br/>\nchild/family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not picking on you, Lynda.  This just happens to be attached to your <br/>\npost. Your point about psychological scars not showing up for years is very <br/>\nwell taken and I agree.  For that reason (and many others), it behooves each <br/>\nof us as parents/caretakers to do the best job we possibly can with the <br/>\nchildren entrusted to us.  However, there is no way for me to judge via the <br/>\ninternet whether someone is a good parent.  I&#39;m not willing to go there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO the tragedy of this thread is that a mother was looking for support in <br/>\nreaching her husband because they had a difference of opinion concerning the <br/>\ndiscipline methods to be used in their family.  As a mother, she felt DH was <br/>\nheaded in a direction which was too harsh to her tender heart and wanted help <br/>\nfinding a way to reach DH and help him understand her position.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn response, she got gut level reactions to her example only...an example she <br/>\nshared with us to demonstrate the difference in expectations between herself <br/>\nand DH.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO she got very little help with her actual question.  She got <br/>\n(figuratively) shoved up against the wall and cornered emotionally.  How did <br/>\nthat help?  Now, she has to try and deal with having been called names, <br/>\n&#39;informed&#39; that she and her husband are both abusive parents, with the <br/>\nimplication that they have no right to these children.   From there we got <br/>\ngeographical and parenting slurs hurled, creating lots of defensive people.  <br/>\nAgain, this helped how?<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO We&#39;ve really missed the boat here, folks.  This was a great chance to <br/>\nshare skills, knowledge and information with each other.

But I must assume you and<br/>\n&gt; Valerie live in the backwaters of Tennessee, or some hick mountain<br/>\n&gt; top in West Virginia and not in the modern world where people don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; treat their children as objects to be controlled.  Hubby just<br/>\n&gt; said &quot;and these kind of people unschool?&quot;  My husband just said if he<br/>\n&gt; saw someone spanking a child he&#39;d go over and intervene, whether the<br/>\n&gt; other parent liked it or not, and he&#39;s actually done that once before<br/>\n&gt; when someone was yanking on their child&#39;s arm when they were getting<br/>\n&gt; them out of a car... I guess it&#39;s a personal preference this spanking<br/>\n&gt; thing... but for the life of me I cannot see any logic in it, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all emotion based and based on how the parent is feeling at the time,<br/>\n&gt; which is rageful.  If it wasn&#39;t based on emotion a parent could make<br/>\n&gt; an appointment with their child at say 5pm to be spanked and everyone<br/>\n&gt; would be happy... That&#39;s never the case so therefore it must be done<br/>\n&gt; out of rage... How would you like it, if you did something that I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t like and I grabbed you and spanked you?  You would be utterly<br/>\n&gt; humiliated and appalled by my behavior.  So what&#39;s the difference?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I could see some logic in this whole spanking issue, then I might<br/>\n&gt; agree with it... But it doesn&#39;t matter what way you say it, how you<br/>\n&gt; present an argument for it, it&#39;s not logical and if it&#39;s not logical<br/>\n&gt; for an adult then it&#39;s certainly doesn&#39;t make any sense to a child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again my HO and now I&#39;ll go and put on an even bigger suit of armour<br/>\n&gt; and try and calm down over this issue, which I actually thought was<br/>\n&gt; dead until I read this post.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dawn F<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Valerie, a huge THANK YOU.

And the only <br/>\nreason that one could have for pulling down the pants and hitting the <br/>\nbare bottom is to make the experience more painful.  I have no <br/>\nproblem with someone getting a wake-up call such as a swift swat on <br/>\ntheir sitting down end or even a couple of swift ones with their <br/>\nclothing on.

I held him again and expressed my love for him and <br/>\nlet him know that there was nothing he could do to make me stop <br/>\nloving him. NOTHING. I still feel this today. I will always love my <br/>\nchildren to this degree. And I didn&#39;t just say it in passing. I held <br/>\nhim until was calm and he was ready to leave. And I allowed him to <br/>\ndecide when he was ready to leave. That is when the ordeal was over. <br/>\nWas it on his mind for some time after that? Probably. I hope it was <br/>\nsomething that he pondered for some time. Not just the spanking but <br/>\neverything that had happened. Everything that was said. What he did <br/>\nand what my response was to what he did. And my expression of love to <br/>\nhim. Yes.

They are gifts that <br/>\nwe have been entrusted with to hold dear to us and to treasure and to <br/>\nprotect from any harm that may/can come to them. Are we, as parents, <br/>\nat all times cappable of doing that, protecting them at all times <br/>\nfrom any type of harm? No. We are not. We are not perfect. There is <br/>\nno way for any one person to predict what will happen. The best we <br/>\ncan do is to speculate and plan on that. And often times the <br/>\nspeculation doesn&#39;t happen and if/when it does, most of the time it <br/>\nisn&#39;t exactly the way we planned on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I would not expect an adult to have their pants pulled down and get <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a beating, therefore I do not do that to a child simply because they <br/>\nare smaller and I have them in my power.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I have met some adults whose behavior is such that they <br/>\nbehave worse than the most defiant child. And yes, I have see adults <br/>\nand heard stories of things that adults did that yes I think some <br/>\nadults do need a swift kick in the seat of the pants. I also believe <br/>\nthat if more parents were less afraid of CPS there would not be as <br/>\nmuch of a discipline problem among the youth and young adults today. <br/>\nI would rather see a parent discipline thier child with corproal <br/>\npunishment than do nothing at all. My DH sees this every day. He is a <br/>\npolice officer. And he comes home and tells me of parents who say to <br/>\nhim, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t want to hit my child because what if CPS comes to <br/>\nmy house?&quot; Ya know what, the law does not state that you can&#39;t hit <br/>\nyour child as a form of punishment. This is dirrectly from the Texas <br/>\nPenal Code SubchapterF. Special RElationships 9.61. Parent-child.<br/>\n(a)The use of force, but not deadly force, against a child younger <br/>\nthan 18 years is justified:(1)if the actor is the child&#39;s parent or <br/>\nstepparent or is acting on loco parentis to the child; and (2) when <br/>\nand to the degree the actor reasonbly believes the force is necessare <br/>\nto discipline the child or to safeguare or promote his welfare. (b) <br/>\nFor the purposes of this section, &quot;in loco parentis&quot; includes <br/>\ngrandparent and guardian, any person acting by, through, or under the <br/>\ndirection of a court with jusrisdiction over the child, and anyone <br/>\nwho has express or implied consent of the parent or parents. The law <br/>\ndoes not state that you can not hit your child. It says reasonable <br/>\nbut not deadly force. There was no risk of death to my child and I <br/>\nwent further than what a lot of people would have by reasuring him of <br/>\nmy love and allowing him to decide when he was ready to leave the <br/>\nsituation. I didn&#39;t spank him and then tell him to quit crying and <br/>\nto &quot;fix his face&quot; as I have seen many parents do. I allowed him to <br/>\nexpress his emotions and when he said he was ready, then we left and <br/>\nnot before.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But what was the real clincher were a few other statements that you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>made. Namely that your hubby feels they need a switch taken to them, <br/>\nthat now is the time to begin using a switch (like there is some rule <br/>\nwritten that says at a certain age we begin using objects to hit <br/>\nchildren with)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I never said that I agreed with DH to start using the switch. In fact <br/>\nI am totally against it. That is the main reason of my inisial <br/>\npost...How to deal with differences between DH and myself when it <br/>\ncomes to disciplining the children. I have told him that I totally <br/>\ndisagree with this. He knows how I stand. That doesn&#39;t mean that he <br/>\nhas to follow and do what I feel is best for the children. He still <br/>\nhas the right to use a switch if he feels the situation warrents it. <br/>\nI am still at a loss as to how to handle the situation when and if it <br/>\never arise.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and you repeated saying that you would probably do it again.  It was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the sum total of what you did added to what you said and what you <br/>\nsaid you would still do.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lynda<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I did not say I would still do this. What I did say was given the <br/>\nexact same surcumstance and the situation that I was in at the time I <br/>\nwould make the same decission. There are also other cercumstances <br/>\nthat I have not revealed and I am not sure it would make a difference <br/>\nbut here they are. At the time DH had been an officer for about 1.5 <br/>\nyears. We were living in a drug and gang infested neighborhood. This <br/>\nis an area that we were living in prior to DH becoming a police <br/>\nofficer and we were working on getting out. The mall we were at was <br/>\nthe nearest mall to the neighborhood although it was in a much better <br/>\ntown about 10 min up the freeway. However, everyone in my <br/>\nneighborhood went to this mall. There were a lot of good clean honest <br/>\npeopl who went to this mall and I also know that there were a lot of <br/>\nscum who went to this mall because I knew who my next door neighbors <br/>\nwere and what type of business they were running. And most of the <br/>\npeople in the surrounding area were into the same business. These <br/>\nwere the same type of people that my husband had been arresting and <br/>\nbeen putting behind bars for 1.5 years. And although he patrolled a <br/>\nneighborhood that was a good 20-30 miles away he did run into people <br/>\nfrom our end of town while on patrol. The people in our neighborhood <br/>\nknew what he did for a living. They knew he was a police officer. And <br/>\neven those who didn&#39;t know us knew because they look out for each <br/>\nother. Also, It is hard to hide a police officer leaving for work in <br/>\nfull uniform. Do you know how many of these criminals would love to <br/>\nget thier hands on the family of an officer simply because the <br/>\nofficer was doing his job. The threat of my son being kidnapped at <br/>\nthe mall that day was real. It was more real to us than to someone <br/>\nwho isn&#39;t in law enforcement. And maybe the person would not have <br/>\ndone any of the things I proposed but the threat of the danger he put <br/>\nhimself in was so much worse than the spanking he rescieved. It was <br/>\nworse than him playing with a knife or near the hot stove. It was his <br/>\nlife as he deserves have it lived being turning into one of illegal <br/>\nhorrors that one should never have to be forced into. That is the <br/>\nreal threat that he faced that day. And it is a real threat. DH has <br/>\nhad drug dealers threaten his life on many occasions because he <br/>\ncaught them and then put them in jail. And a threat on anyone&#39;s life <br/>\nis real, especially that of a police officer. And I still stand <br/>\nbehind my decission that day to spank my child in the manner that I <br/>\ndid.

That is what dimples you could see through the<br/>\nbruising.  She had bruises (with finger prints) up and down her arms and<br/>\nobviously punch bruises on her ribs.  The babysitter brought her in because<br/>\nshe was having trouble breathing.  The parents arrived a little while later<br/>\nscreaming that no one had the right to tell them how to care for their<br/>\nchild and that she had, (yeah right) fallen down the stairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne little boy (18 months) came in with hypothermia because he had been<br/>\nthrown through a window and left out all night on the lawn.  You see, he<br/>\ncried too much.  Maybe because he had cigarette burns and pins stuck under<br/>\nhis little fingernails.  After counseling he was returned to his parents, 3<br/>\nmonths later he was dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultimate in &quot;abuse&quot; was when a father got peeved at his wife and &quot;to<br/>\nteach her a lesson&quot; picked up their 12 yo daughter from school and took her<br/>\nto where her mother worked.  He honked the horn and then blew up the car! <br/>\nWe got a body bag with pieces in it!  The mother is still<br/>\ninstitutionalized!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the psych reports on these folks showed that spanking was the norm for<br/>\ndiscipline and that they felt no one had any business telling them how to<br/>\ntreat their children.

YOU all are the ones who <br/>\nchose to judge me on based on something that happened nearly 2 years <br/>\nago and if you think I am abusive to my kids call CPS on me. I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t give a flying______. I know what they will find. Spanking a <br/>\nchild one time on the bare bum doesn&#39;t not make an abuser. You can&#39;t <br/>\njudge a person on ONE INCIDENT. And I don&#39;t care what your position <br/>\nis. I don&#39;t care if you are a mandated reporter you are not in the <br/>\nposition to judge me on something you heard over the internet about <br/>\nsomeone you never met. If you knew me personally and then chose to <br/>\njudge me on what you know of me that would be completely different, <br/>\nbut the majority of the people who have replied to my post have <br/>\njudged me based on one incident 2 years ago. Now, maybe it is that <br/>\nyou all think that I am a liar and therefore if I spanked him as such <br/>\n2 years ago then I spank him like that every time he does something <br/>\ninappropriate, but that is assuming and you have no evidence as such.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; A four year old is a child and if the child got away from an adult, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it is the ADULT&#39;s responsibility!  Period!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are absulutely right. It is my responsibility. I am responsible <br/>\nfor how I teach my children and at preasant the choices they make and <br/>\nhow I deal with those choices. And how they turn out as adults is a <br/>\nreflection on me as a parent. I give them choices to make. Age <br/>\napropriate choices every day i.e. picking up after themselves, what <br/>\nprogram do you want to watch, what story would you like to read, and <br/>\nthere are choices they make everyday on their own that I am not even <br/>\naware of, and they are aware of the rules. When one of these rules is <br/>\nbroken my manner in dealing with it is such that I allow them to take <br/>\na certain amount of responsibility for that. It is my responsibility <br/>\nto teach my children that there are conciquences for the choices they <br/>\nmake whether it is for good or bad. This does not mean that the <br/>\nresponsibility I allow them to take is in the palm of my hand or a <br/>\nstick or a whip or any other object. But at five almost six years old <br/>\nhe tends to blame me for him being sent to his room or having the toy <br/>\ntaken away or loosing a privilidge and the fact is that I would not <br/>\ndo any of these things for no reason. Which is what he tends to think <br/>\nI do. And I explain to him that it is his behavior that is <br/>\ninappropriate and that when he is ready to act appropriate then he <br/>\nmay have the privilidge returned. And  our day goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As to judging, this isn&#39;t a case of defining &quot;is.&quot;  Who someone is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>or isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t have any weight.  Each and every abuser states they <br/>\nlove their children or spouse.  Every single solitary one of them!  <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t justify hitting.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So if a person states that they love their children and spanks them <br/>\nfor something they did wrong even if it was one time they are then <br/>\ndefined as an abuser and need to be dealt with by the state? If <br/>\nthat&#39;s the case the state has some serious problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That article is one person&#39;s opinion and not the defintion of child <br/>\n </span></blockquote>abuse.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay so let me ask you this. By definition you mean the govn&#39;ts <br/>\ndefinition.(Correct me if I am wrong) So now the govn&#39;t defines what <br/>\nis right and what is wrong. And their diffinition is the only one <br/>\nthat is right? So they are right to say that drinking is a good <br/>\nthing. Because if it were bad it would be illegal, right. That <br/>\nabortion is a good thing. Because if were bad it too would be illegal <br/>\nThat you are monitarily responsible if a person breaks into your home <br/>\nand they get hurt in the process. Because if this were the case <br/>\npeople would not be held accountable for incidents of this type. I am <br/>\nsorry but I don&#39;t let the govn&#39;t, or anyone else for that matter, to <br/>\ndefine my life for me. Nor do I want to define another person&#39;s life <br/>\nfor them. I take full responsibility for my actions and I am teaching <br/>\nmy children to do the same. Isn&#39;t that part of why most of us chose <br/>\nto homeschool in the first place. IMO, if anyone allows another <br/>\nentity to define for them what is right and what is wrong may as well <br/>\nsend their kids to PS because they will definately learn that there <br/>\nand it would be much easier on the parents offering all that free <br/>\ntime.

Now I am over my hurt and I am just plain angery. I have <br/>\n&gt; something to say on the subject of corporal punishment. There is a <br/>\n&gt; time and a place for it. In the situation that I shared about my son <br/>\n&gt; running off in a packed mall I had repeatedly discussed the matter of <br/>\n&gt; running off and explained to him repeatedly that I must be able to <br/>\n&gt; see him at all times when we are in public. I would have explained <br/>\n&gt; further as to some of the dangers, kidnapping being number one, <br/>\n&gt; however I did not feel this was appropriate at his age. And maybe I <br/>\n&gt; could have come up with other danger/reasons as to why I had to see <br/>\n&gt; him at all times, however, at the time I was not in a situation to <br/>\n&gt; readily come up with these as it was the first time I was having to <br/>\n&gt; deal with this situation, he is my oldest child. He did understand <br/>\n&gt; the rule of not running off and I knew he understood because he had <br/>\n&gt; exhibited his understanding by not running off when it was obvious <br/>\n&gt; that he wanted to. He understood. This day he was preoccupied by the <br/>\n&gt; colors and lights of a near by store and forgot the rule and left me <br/>\n&gt; to go to the store to explore. I would have had no problem taking him <br/>\n&gt; there to look if he had just asked, but he didn&#39;t. He placed himself <br/>\n&gt; in a potentially dangerous situation. The danger was that the mall <br/>\n&gt; was packed. It was a weekend and in the afternoon. It was extremely <br/>\n&gt; likely that he could have been kidnapped by some pervert. Anyone <br/>\n&gt; watched the news lately. You know what they do to kids they take. The <br/>\n&gt; danger was that whoever may have took him very likely could have <br/>\n&gt; molested him in ways that you or I could never imagine that anyone <br/>\n&gt; could molest, then killed him, dimembered him, cooked him and <br/>\n&gt; devoured him. Any and every one of these things was likely to have <br/>\n&gt; happened to him. Just as likely as it to get cut when playing with a <br/>\n&gt; knife. However, he wasn&#39;t playing with a knife. He sepparated himself <br/>\n&gt; from the safety of his mother without her knowledge. And to tell me <br/>\n&gt; that I am abusive because I spanked him on his bare hiney for this is <br/>\n&gt; ludicriss. To judge me and say that I damaged him physically, <br/>\n&gt; mentally, and sexually because I spanked him on his bare hiney is <br/>\n&gt; utterly rediculous especially in comparison to the possible damage of <br/>\n&gt; the danger he placed himself in at that time and possibly in the <br/>\n&gt; future if I had not taken the opportunity to express to him the <br/>\n&gt; severity of his choice to run off. He made a choice that he knew was <br/>\n&gt; wrong and I held him accountable for that choice. And after I spanked <br/>\n&gt; him let him know that I still loved him. And I also let him know how <br/>\n&gt; scared I was when I didn&#39;t know where he was, that I thought I would <br/>\n&gt; never see him again. I hug and kiss my children every day. In nearly <br/>\n&gt; 6 years there hasn&#39;t been a day gone by that we haven&#39;t shared this <br/>\n&gt; affection toward each other. I have always made it a point to let my <br/>\n&gt; children know that there is nothing they can do or say that will make <br/>\n&gt; me stop loving them. They could commit the worst crime and I will <br/>\n&gt; still love them. That doesn&#39;t mean that I will agree and support what <br/>\n&gt; they do. It means they will always have a place in my heart and that <br/>\n&gt; place will never shrink. They know I love them and I know they love <br/>\n&gt; me. So if you think that I am abusive because I spanked my child <br/>\n&gt; almost 2 years ago that is your opinion. It is my opinion that you <br/>\n&gt; judge too quickly seeming that you passed this judgement on me not <br/>\n&gt; knowing me, my background or really much of my personal situation. <br/>\n&gt; And I guess if that is the responsibility you want that is your <br/>\n&gt; choice to pass that type of judgement on another person. And in <br/>\n&gt; defense of DH. Just because he thinks that we should start using a <br/>\n&gt; switch on the children does not make him physically abusive either. <br/>\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t mean that I agree with him however it doesn&#39;t make him <br/>\n&gt; abusive. Everyone has thier way of dealing with certain situations. <br/>\n&gt; And just because one way is harsher than another doesn&#39;t mean it is <br/>\n&gt; abuse. If the public/govn&#39;t starts dictating how a parent can and <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t disapline thier child then we all may as well send our children <br/>\n&gt; to public school and let the govn&#39;t raise all children. Here is an <br/>\n&gt; article that explains the difference between abuse and over <br/>\n&gt; discipline. There is a huge difference. And just because a person <br/>\n&gt; spanks thier child does not mean that they have over disciplined <br/>\n&gt; thier child. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cpswatch.com/reports/discipline.htm\">http://www.cpswatch.com/reports/discipline.htm</a> Corallyn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Corallyn","from":"&quot;Corallyn &quot; &lt;hape2day@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"LnLE2xU1mQ8-8z9tp2c7YnWryIXkb6_n6UCRH9WqP7GK7hm2xPqE4vReGmonHan8uPf_EfIitidBeYhDevPDGEfJXVTDtfA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Differences with DH","postDate":"967964026","msgId":12480,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhvc3NocSs5ZDhoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2LjcxYjg2YjQuMjZlMzNjY2VAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12478,"nextInTopic":12484,"prevInTime":12479,"nextInTime":12481,"topicId":12478,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay.
