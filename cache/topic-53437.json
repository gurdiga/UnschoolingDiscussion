We do feel that we must draw those lines,<br/>\nstill. How have you all handled this?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all Julie, I really enjoyed reading your post. It seemed so full of <br/>\npromise and joy, I smiled the whole time reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as drawing lines, you may find that what you start out with ends up <br/>\nlooking different. I think this may be the hardest of things to let go of. I <br/>\nstill tend to cringe inside when my 7 and 8 year olds watch a moivie where <br/>\nthe F word flies around like birds. Doesn&#39;t phase them in the least and I <br/>\nhave never heard them use that word......yet. &lt;BG&gt; My oldest was raised <br/>\npretty much the same way and is very polite around those she &quot;should&quot; be <br/>\npolite around, being a wonderfully enchanting almost 17 year old. Has no <br/>\nproblem telling us stories in her language or cussing like a sailor when <br/>\nshe&#39;s mad at a friend! It&#39;s all find with me, after all, I&#39;m pretty much the <br/>\nsame way!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that was hard for me was the sexual situations in movies. I <br/>\nremember with my oldest just not allowing her to see stuff too racey as far <br/>\nas I was concerned. Not really sure when that changed. I know she was seeing <br/>\nR rated movies much earlier than most of her friends were allowed to. Then <br/>\nagain, her friends were sneaking in and I was buying her tickets so she <br/>\ncould get in. Never had a problem because of it. My son doesn&#39;t like sexual <br/>\nsituations and chooses not to watch. It makes him uncomfortable and so we <br/>\nrent accordingly. He also doesn&#39;t like anything too scary so we respect that <br/>\nalso. His sister just happens to go along with right now. The 2 year old <br/>\ncould care less about what&#39;s on TV so we don&#39;t worry. She&#39;s never in the <br/>\nroom long enough to have it be an issue!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest listens to some pretty racey music language wise, she has always <br/>\non her own turned it off if the little ones wanted to be with her in her <br/>\nroom. She does the same if a movie is on she knows won&#39;t set right with <br/>\nthem. We are not and either is she fanatical about it though.

Landon would laugh at them, and &quot;appreciate&quot; thier <br/>\nhumor, but he probably wouldnt wear them..  Thats because he has a strict <br/>\n&quot;don&#39;t stand out&quot; philosophy about clothing.  He doesnt wear anything with <br/>\nlogos or brand names on it (showing predominantly)  No bright colors or <br/>\npatterns.. Mostly black, white, navy and khaki. and denim.  He doesnt want to <br/>\nbe identified by his attire.  He wants his personality and uniqueness to be <br/>\nevident in other ways besides flashy clothes.   Its like, he has friends who <br/>\nare &quot;goths&quot;, &quot;cowboy folk&quot; , punk rock looking alternative style wearing <br/>\nfolks,  &quot;granolas&quot;, &quot;grungies&quot;. and those that only wear high fashion trendy <br/>\nclothes.. He likes them all, but he doesnt really identify with one <br/>\nparticular group. He choses his friends based on thier personalities and how <br/>\nmuch he enjoys being around them. <br/>\n<br/>\n I think Ethan and JP will be different.and thier tastes in clothing will be <br/>\nmore eclectic.. JP already likes to wear &quot;cool clothes&quot; and have a &quot;cool <br/>\nhaircut&quot;  Ethan wanted a black leather bomber jacket for Christmas so he <br/>\ncould look &quot;cool&quot;   Anna is more like Landon, although, her main objective is <br/>\n&quot;looking good&quot; in her clothes.   And, she doesnt want to wear anything that <br/>\nlooks &quot;too old&quot; LOL.. But, she is also very conservative in her attire.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s not comfortable in short skirts or tight pants or low cut shirts.

What activities  do we do - by ourselves or together.

I greatly appreciate your<br/>\nwillingness to open up and share about your life in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was reading, I agreed when you said &quot;anything he loves to do we<br/>\nwould continue to do&quot;.  And then I read further and started to wonder if<br/>\nmy instincts were right.  (Just as you seem to be wondering.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be fascinated to see what everyone has to say and how this<br/>\nsituation eventually works out for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now I have two thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I think it&#39;s okay to keep the same timetables as before but make<br/>\neverything optional.  When you would normally give an assignment or<br/>\ntest, ask &quot;would you like me to give you an assignment (or test)?&quot; When<br/>\nyou would normally give dictation, ask &quot;would you like to do dictation<br/>\nnow?&quot;.  When you would normally read aloud ask &quot;would you like me to<br/>\nread aloud now?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some kids having the same things *offered* at the same times might<br/>\nbe comforting.  Your son may say &quot;Yes&quot; to the familiar things for<br/>\nawhile, but I think eventually he&#39;ll feel free to say &quot;Nah, I&#39;m already<br/>\ndoing this other thing and I don&#39;t want to stop.&quot;  It may not even take long!<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Maybe giving a lot of approval all the time, not dependent on<br/>\nperformance, will help a kid who&#39;s oriented towards &quot;pleasing&quot;.  I&#39;m<br/>\nsuggesting you be pleased with him without him having to perform for it.<br/>\n (I&#39;m not trying to imply any criticism of you, just trying to guess how<br/>\nhe might be wired.)<br/>\n<br/>\n**But I am hoping that we can work together to set goals that he <br/>\nvalues and hits rather than needing to be the &quot;good boy&quot; who <br/>\ndoes what I tell him to.**<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yeah.

(It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t until reading this list that I realized just how far away I<br/>\nhad gotten from that philosophy!) <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I had never considered not monitoring computer, TV or X <br/>\nbox use. I am so tired of being the &quot;turn monitor&quot; as in, who gets <br/>\nto go on next for how long.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we shared with them, their eyes got so wide. Certain <br/>\ncomments were expected, &quot;But Mom, you still want us doing our <br/>\nmath and science and grammar, right?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Actually honey, that&#39;s up to you now. If you&#39;d like to continue, you <br/>\nmay but I am not requiring it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But I have a science test today and I studied for it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I know. You can still take it if you like. But you don&#39;t have to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEyes grow two sizes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext child (8) says, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll play on the X Box for 97 hours a<br/>\nday!&quot; (Clearly this child hasn&#39;t been reading his math book &lt;g&gt;) <br/>\nHe looks at us with testing eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh says, &quot;That&#39;s fine, except you may need to sleep in there <br/>\nsome time.&quot; Blank stare and shock.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest beams and gets it right away. He almost gets tears in <br/>\nhis eyes thinking that he can finally devote hours to playing guitar <br/>\nand piano, not just thirty minutes a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle child looks appalled. &quot;How can we still learn math if we <br/>\ndon&#39;t do it every day? How will we be ready for high school or <br/>\ncollege?&quot; (I can see I&#39;ve instilled that thinking thoroughly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI carefully explained many of the things you all shared with me <br/>\nyesterday and then my dh added his pov based on his <br/>\nexperience with bored college kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrought up the Digital camcorder idea and they all went wild. <br/>\nSuddenly being at home sounded so exciting!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went home with some euphoria. Headed straight to the <br/>\nlibrary and we checked out such cool books and videos. Dd (13) <br/>\nhas an interest in tree frogs! Who knew? She got a book on <br/>\ntemporary tattos that you can make at home. She checked out so <br/>\nmany books on India you&#39;d think she was about to write a <br/>\nresearch paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther finds: military books and DDay videos. The history of rock <br/>\nmusic. Casablanca (the video). Decorating ideas to transform <br/>\nthe girls&#39; room. Cookbooks for the middle child. Lots of movies <br/>\nand books of all sorts for the youngest girl, who still wants to <br/>\nlearn to read, Mom..<br/>\n<br/>\nCame home and the X Box went on instantly. But dd (13) <br/>\nsuddenly started to cry. &quot;They should do some school first, <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t they? And would you really let us listen to <br/>\nEminem if we wanted to? Just say no. You can say no. I want you <br/>\nto be my mother. You have to tell me what to do. I would be on IM <br/>\nall day and then I&#39;ll go nowhere and never go to college. That isn&#39;t <br/>\ngood for me. Mothers are supposed to set rules so I can rebel <br/>\nagainst them.&quot; She started to chuckle through her tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was amazing. I realized then just how much more controlling <br/>\nI&#39;ve been than I even realized (and let me tell you, we are really <br/>\nlenient parents for our peer group). I let her know that I trust her, <br/>\nthat her insights into herself will be a tremendous guide to not <br/>\nwasting her life and I handed her the Teenage Liberation <br/>\nhandbook. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater we all watched Huckleberry Finn together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt bedtime tonight, my middle boy came downstairs crying. He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to change our lifestyle. He likes being given <br/>\nassignments. He likes tests. He likes our read aloud times. He <br/>\nlikes dictation. I told him that I had every intention of reading <br/>\naloud to him still and that anything he loves to do we would <br/>\ncontinue to do. But then I saw the real issue. He&#39;s a pleaser and <br/>\nwhat he wants is for me to set the agenda so he can perform *for <br/>\nme.* This will take some time to navigate.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am hoping that we can work together to set goals that he <br/>\nvalues and hits rather than needing to be the &quot;good boy&quot; who <br/>\ndoes what I tell him to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, lots to process. I still don&#39;t know where the line is <br/>\nbetween letting them learn what interests them and the natural <br/>\nprocess of limiting their exposure to questionable material (such <br/>\nas song lyrics that are inappropriate for young kids, or movies <br/>\nthat are too adult...). We do feel that we must draw those lines, <br/>\nstill. How have you all handled this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your input yesterday. I feel like I have a new lease on <br/>\nlife with the kids. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have new questions every day, but <br/>\nfor today, this is such a relief. I really had started to think that<br/>\nI ought to use the school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this feels like home.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53642,"nextTopicId":53520}}
