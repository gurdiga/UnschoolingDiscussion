I m going to call myself that everytime I m doing things I don t feel like doing.  Sometimes I need to remember that I m doing it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-578544806\">Bridget,<br/>\nHaha, stepford mom!  I&#39;m going to call myself that everytime I&#39;m doing<br/>\nthings I don&#39;t feel like doing.  Sometimes I need to remember that I&#39;m<br/>\ndoing it because I want to, not to satisfy someone else&#39;s selfish ways. <br/>\nI am learning that there are ways to ask my kids to do things without<br/>\nactually asking and without threatening.  If there is something to do, I<br/>\ncan just describe it.  Usually, someone will volunteer.  I learned this<br/>\nfrom a book called How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids<br/>\nWill Talk.  But the reason I read it was because my kids would not<br/>\ncooperate with their chore charts.  We still have charts as guidelines in<br/>\ncase they want some guidance, but not as a must.  Also, walking them<br/>\nthrough is another way to engage cooperation.  I really have found that<br/>\nif I ask the kids to do something without me they will try and avoid it. <br/>\nIf I say, &quot;The recycles are on the back porch, I want them in the car.&quot;<br/>\nto my two oldest, they will usually go and do it willingly.  If I say,<br/>\n&quot;Go and do this,&quot; they often find excuses or make themselves scarce.  If<br/>\nI describe the situation and describe my feelings, and they still don&#39;t<br/>\ndo it, then I know they probably not only don&#39;t want to but may feel<br/>\noverwhelmed by the job.  So, I&#39;ll say, &quot;It seems to me that you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do it?&quot;  And they will say, &quot;Not now, I&#39;m really interested in<br/>\nthis book&quot; or something like that.  Or they might say, &quot;Can I do it<br/>\nlater?&quot;  Then we agree on another time and if they avoid it, I say, &quot;We<br/>\nhave an agreement.&quot;  Or, if it can&#39;t wait, I will say, &quot;I really need<br/>\nyour help with this.  I don&#39;t have much time and I&#39;m worried I won&#39;t get<br/>\ndone in time.&quot;  Then, instead of expecting them to do it alone, I do it<br/>\nwith them.  Doing things with them is always more enjoyable than barking<br/>\norders at them and expecting them to do things on their own, or me doing<br/>\nit alone.  I used to hate it when my Dad, a rancher, would interrupt my<br/>\nplay for hard, &quot;men&#39;s work&quot;.  But I didn&#39;t mind as much when we were<br/>\nworking together, in fact, I looked forward to doing chores together with<br/>\nhim.  I have learned a lot about boundaries since realizing I have<br/>\n&quot;codependency issues&quot; a few years ago.  That I am me and others are not<br/>\nme.  Part of this involves not demanding things of others, but part of it<br/>\nalso is self-respect, and expressing my desires and opinions.  The fine<br/>\nline between not being controlling and not being passive and overly<br/>\ntolerant was interesting to find, and I am still finding it.  <br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32698,"nextTopicId":32701}}
