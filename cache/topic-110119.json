Texture can be a big issue.  They can and will hold out for what feels comfortable to them.  They can also get fixated on the television or computer and have a very difficult time switching gears to another activity.  High intelligence is common, but there is usually some type of language issue involved--either with speech or comprehension or both.  Depression can be a secondary factor for individuals on the spectrum, and autism can be hereditary.  It could be that the mother has some symptoms and your nephew has inherited some, as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could be way off, too.  But it is something to consider, and it often goes undiagnosed by teachers and pediatricians.  If you can figure out what is going on with him, it will be easier to pinpoint ways of helping him cope.  You may, in any case, want to read more about autism and food intolerance/obsessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps--my daughter is on the spectrum and the rate of autism is quite high.  <br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leobellalace@...\">leobellalace@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, November 21, 2005 8:45 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] eating habits of 5 year old?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  To make a long story short, I have a 5 year old nephew whose mother suffers from depression.  This affects her lifestyle and habits and therefore her son&#39;s habits, etc.  (There is no insurance, therefore no medication, but she wouldn&#39;t take it properly if there was.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  She eats once a day or so, sometimes not at all, and will literally sleep 20 of 24 hours if she is able.  My nephew is in kindergarten now so they feed him lunch and his before-after-care provides snacks, so he does eat something, but his mom doesn&#39;t prepare food for him regularly, sometimes just tells him to eat out of the cereal box.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The concern most of the family has is that he is absolutely the pickiest eater any of us have ever seen.  If he doesn&#39;t want something, he will literally (and *deliberately*) make himself throw up in the middle of the table.  Of course, then no one wants to eat any of the food (including me!)  He won&#39;t try anything new and will go hungry rather than taste something.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  (When he was 2, my mother was watching him for a week and by the evening of the 2nd day she was in tears because he *refused* to eat *anything* put in front of him.  My mother finally drove by McDonald&#39;s one day on the way into town and he said something, so she immediately pulled in and bought him nuggets.  He ate NOTHING but nugget happy meals for the entire time my mother had him!!!  When his mother got him back, my mom asked her about it and she said that was what she always gave him, even before he could walk.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  He is undersize and wants to do nothing but sit in the house watching tv, but on the upside he seems to be very bright.  There are some emotional and behavioral issues stemming (we think) from his life so far (there have been some abusive situations as well as the neglect.) <br/>\n<br/>\n  Could refusing to eat be a way he maintains some sort of control over his life?  And how do we ensure he is eating enough to be healthy?

This affects her lifestyle and habits and therefore her son&#39;s habits, etc.  (There is no insurance, therefore no medication, but she wouldn&#39;t take it properly if there was.)<br/>\n <br/>\nShe eats once a day or so, sometimes not at all, and will literally sleep 20 of 24 hours if she is able.  My nephew is in kindergarten now so they feed him lunch and his before-after-care provides snacks, so he does eat something, but his mom doesn&#39;t prepare food for him regularly, sometimes just tells him to eat out of the cereal box.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe concern most of the family has is that he is absolutely the pickiest eater any of us have ever seen.  If he doesn&#39;t want something, he will literally (and *deliberately*) make himself throw up in the middle of the table.  Of course, then no one wants to eat any of the food (including me!)  He won&#39;t try anything new and will go hungry rather than taste something.  <br/>\n <br/>\n(When he was 2, my mother was watching him for a week and by the evening of the 2nd day she was in tears because he *refused* to eat *anything* put in front of him.  My mother finally drove by McDonald&#39;s one day on the way into town and he said something, so she immediately pulled in and bought him nuggets.  He ate NOTHING but nugget happy meals for the entire time my mother had him!!!  When his mother got him back, my mom asked her about it and she said that was what she always gave him, even before he could walk.)<br/>\n <br/>\nHe is undersize and wants to do nothing but sit in the house watching tv, but on the upside he seems to be very bright.  There are some emotional and behavioral issues stemming (we think) from his life so far (there have been some abusive situations as well as the neglect.) <br/>\n <br/>\nCould refusing to eat be a way he maintains some sort of control over his life?  And how do we ensure he is eating enough to be healthy?  Any suggestions?<br/>\n___________________________________________________<br/>\nTry the New Netscape Mail Today!<br/>\nVirtually Spam-Free | More Storage | Import Your Contact List<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.netscape.com\">http://mail.netscape.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110493,"nextTopicId":110165}}
