But that s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1087804696\">Heather,<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling is illegal in Germany.  Children go to school, period,<br/>\nbeginning at age 6 unless you petition the state to wait until age 7.  But<br/>\nthat&#39;s all the time you get.  It&#39;s a socialization issue for the Germans, in<br/>\nthe correct sense of the word.  They want their children socialized to be<br/>\ngood citizens of their society, and school is where that is taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s legal for us as U.S. military and civilians working for the U.S.<br/>\ngovernment to homeschool under the Status of Forces Agreements, because our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s education is handled by an American government agency, not the<br/>\nGermans.  However, if you are a U.S. citizen living in Germany, outside of<br/>\nemployment by the U.S. government (who sends us there &quot;involuntarily&quot;), you<br/>\nhave voluntarily chosen to live under German law.  I go to an American<br/>\nchurch there, and had friends in the &quot;ordinary American citizen&quot; category<br/>\nwho have now moved back to the states because their oldest is 6, and they<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, No.  You are not allowed to, as far as I understand.  I do know of<br/>\none family that homeschools underground, but it&#39;s illegal, they have to be<br/>\nridiculously careful, and it&#39;s not easy.  But that&#39;s another question.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\non 4/23/02 8:52 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Brenda,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I may have opportunity to work in Germany - you noted that homeschooling is<br/>\n&gt; illegal in Germany - are you legal because you are an American citizen - or<br/>\n&gt; because you are military.  I was just curious, because this will be a deciding<br/>\n&gt; factor for me. If I am an ordinary working person - but an American, am I<br/>\n&gt; allowed to homeschool/unschool while living there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any info :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Heather </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35833,"nextTopicId":35844}}
