I&#39;ve always been interested. In fact I do a lot of such discussion <br/>\nover on the NHEN-legislative list as do a number of other people here. I <br/>\nthink it is fascinating and critically important to our children&#39;s children&#39;s <br/>\nfreedom to homeschool/unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - please don&#39;t think that not wanting to do it here means hiding our heads <br/>\nin the sand. I&#39;ve spent the last 3 years of my life extremely involved in <br/>\nhelping to found the National Home Education Network and one of our major <br/>\ntasks has been specifically to create places for homeschoolers to get hsing <br/>\npolitics information and provide places to discuss and debate and network.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t think THIS is the best place for it. The list owner and the list <br/>\nmoderators and a number of long-time active listmembers have consistently <br/>\nasked people to try to understand what this list is really for and try to <br/>\nsupport that and not hinder it. A little off-topic chit-chat is one thing, <br/>\nbut consistently turning topics into anti-public school tirades is, at best, <br/>\na list-culture faux pas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who care a lot and who have very strong political opinions sometimes <br/>\nseem to have a problem catching on to where and how much to go on about their <br/>\npet topic. They often think that it is their ideas that people are offended <br/>\nby, when, in fact, people are offended by their going on too much and seeming <br/>\nto turn every topic into the opportunity for yet another rant on their own <br/>\nfavorite subject. What surprises me is that they keep doing it even after it <br/>\nis obvious they are either boring people or offending them -- neither of <br/>\nthose is going to win converts to their cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n---pamS<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2292","postDate":"1030436724","msgId":42138,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNkLjIzNDZmOTdjLjJhOWM5MTc0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42136,"nextInTopic":42140,"prevInTime":42137,"nextInTime":42139,"topicId":42134,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/26/2002 11:40:55 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

I like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne answer, for me, is that moral behavior isn&#39;t learned by listening to <br/>\nmoral music or reading only moral books, etc. I think it is learned by having <br/>\na look at immoral behavior and its consequences - in other people, in <br/>\nourselves, in books and music and movies. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m NOT suggesting pornography or graphic violence for young kids. But, even <br/>\nfairy tales are filled with evil -- I happen to think that exposure and <br/>\nexamining and discussing this kind of thing is an important part of moral <br/>\ndevelopment.
