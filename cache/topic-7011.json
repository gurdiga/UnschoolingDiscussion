I think<br/>\n&gt; that there are loads of people who are very informed and some wise<br/>\n&gt; home-schoolers on that list though.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ha Ha, Brooke!  It&#39;s funny you brought the wrist slapping up ... there was just a very long, and actually quite interesting, thread about this this past week on homeschool-ca.  The gist of the discussion was that all of what came up on the list reflected people&#39;s reality in living life with their<br/>\nchildren, and the learning that takes place with the whole mess of it.  The wrist slapping turned into a wonderful welcome to a new subscriber!<br/>\n<br/>\n(I actually subscribe to the digest, so for me the list is pretty manageable.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard of the wonderful support for hs in the Kootenays (Nelson, in particular).  Glad you have that there.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7010,"nextTopicId":6966}}
