Re: Honor Your Childs<br/>\nNeed for Solitude By Fred Rogers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; How did I do THAT??  I left out half the essay!!  Sorry!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jennifer<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Honor Your Child&#39;s Need for Solitude<br/>\n&gt; By Fred Rogers<br/>\n&gt; Fred Rogers, one of the most courageous supporters of childhood, better<br/>\n&gt; known as television&#39;s &quot;Mister Rogers,&quot; a cultural icon and kindly neighbor<br/>\n&gt; to generations of American children, died Thursday, February 27, at the<br/>\nage<br/>\n&gt; of 74.   Here is one of his many great essays.<br/>\n&gt; It isn&#39;t only famous movie stars who want to be alone, and whenever I hear<br/>\n&gt; a celebrity speak of the value of times of solitude and privacy, I find<br/>\n&gt; myself thinking once again how real and deep the need for such times is<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; all human beings.at all ages.<br/>\n&gt; Even for babies?  Solitude? Yes, in some ways, especially for babies-and<br/>\n&gt; certainly that need is real as babies grow into toddlers and preschoolers.<br/>\n&gt; In one family we know, the parents bombarded their baby daughter with toys<br/>\n&gt; that rattled and tinkles and jiggled and spun, toys of all shapes and<br/>\ncolors<br/>\n&gt; and textures.  It seemed as thought that baby hardly had a waking moment<br/>\n&gt; without intense outside stimulation of one kind or another.<br/>\n&gt; Her parents were well meaning; they wanted to encourage her to develop and<br/>\n&gt; learn in any way they could.  But that baby, like most babies, needed time<br/>\n&gt; to get used to all the new things she was finding in her new world.<br/>\n&gt; Even without the parents&#39; efforts to stimulate her, the world is<br/>\n&gt; stimulating enough!  She needed times that were quiet, times of solitude,<br/>\n&gt; and she let her parents know it: when they still insisted she pay<br/>\nattention,<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;d close her eyes and go to sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It can be hard for parents to have their babies turn away from them.  When<br/>\n&gt; a mother finds her baby turning away from her face, it can even seem like<br/>\n&gt; rejection.  But faces, for babies, tend to be even more stimulating than<br/>\n&gt; toys, and a baby who can avoid over stimulation by turning away for a time<br/>\n&gt; may already be showing a healthy coping skill that will be useful all<br/>\n&gt; through life.<br/>\n&gt; The kind of solitude we are talking about goes by many names.  It may be<br/>\n&gt; called &quot;quiet time&quot; or &quot;down time.&quot;  It may be criticized as &quot;daydreaming&quot;<br/>\n&gt; or &quot;wool-gathering&quot; (particularly in school), or it may be promoted later<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; as &quot;meditation&quot; or &quot;deep relaxation.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; But whatever it&#39;s called, it&#39;s a time to ourselves, away from outside<br/>\n&gt; stimulation, during which inner turbulence can settle, and we can become<br/>\n&gt; more familiar and more comfortable with our feelings.<br/>\n&gt; Solitude is different from loneliness and doesn&#39;t have to be a lonely kind<br/>\n&gt; of thing.  In fact, very young children usually find it hard to be all<br/>\nalone<br/>\n&gt; for a long time.  For them the best times of solitude may occur with<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\n&gt; they love and trust nearby, even in the same room.<br/>\n&gt; They may need the reassuring presence of an adult in order to let go, to<br/>\n&gt; feel their feelings. to think back over an event that troubled them, or to<br/>\n&gt; think ahead to a new challenge.  It&#39;s the same kind of comforting<br/>\n&quot;solitary<br/>\n&gt; togetherness,&quot; the companionship in silence that spouses and old friends<br/>\n&gt; sometimes provide one another.<br/>\n&gt; Years ago, I came across a book by the Danish religious philosopher<br/>\n&gt; Johannes Anker-Larsen.  It was called With the Door Open: My Experience.<br/>\nA<br/>\n&gt; passage from it has always stayed with me:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The most comprehensive formula for human culture which I know was given<br/>\nby<br/>\n&gt; the old peasant who, on his deathbed, obtained from his son this one<br/>\n&gt; promise: to sit every day for a half an hour ALONE in the best room.  The<br/>\n&gt; son did this and became a model for the whole district.  This father&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; command has take thought for everything, for Eternity, soul-deepening,<br/>\n&gt; refinement, history.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve thought a good deal about the meaning of that passage.  When I see a<br/>\n&gt; baby quietly staring at his or her hands..or a toddler off in a corner<br/>\n&gt; putting something into a cup and then taking it out, over and over again.<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; a preschooler lying in the grass daydreaming. I like to think that they,<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; their own ways, are &quot;alone in the best room&quot; of their houses, using the<br/>\n&gt; solitude they need to find the courage to grow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Protect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
