The kids played together, not really paying attention to age or sex and the thing that hit me was that they were talking about literature and math problems and Greek mythology instead of Pokemon and playing with stick guns like the &#39;other&#39; kids at the park.  It was that point that I became comfortable with my choice and decided it was true-homeschooled kids really ARE different!<br/>\n<br/>\nEsther<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"brendaclaspell@aol.com","from":"brendaclaspell@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"H6GwqD2ShcJLVP_BXrPri6wpAnADIk1EpdMdAaNzgkrBfz3bo-2Oy5sfcvB4chEOaMGDW7FYz5wmcTznrQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"inspirational for me...","postDate":"998927613","msgId":23704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNC4zYzk4ODRmLjI4YmJjNmZkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23708,"prevInTime":23703,"nextInTime":23705,"topicId":23704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**proof that the kids will not become social outcasts and that homeschooled kids are normal (even if they are freakishly friendly and polite). i thought this","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1571783230\">**proof that the kids will not become social outcasts and that homeschooled <br/>\nkids are normal (even if they are freakishly friendly and polite).<br/>\n<br/>\ni thought this was cute and it reminded me of something i saw in the park the <br/>\nother day. we&#39;re new to the unschool/homeschool thing so we don&#39;t really know <br/>\nany kids that have been homeschooled. we went to the park that we usually go <br/>\nto and i saw the weirdest thing there i&#39;ve never seen before.<br/>\n<br/>\na group of kids age 10-3 were playing TOGETHER! they weren&#39;t even really on <br/>\nthe slides and such, they were forming a troup to build a fort gathering <br/>\nnearby sticks and acorns. when my son of 3 1/2 went to play too, they found <br/>\nhim a stick and helped him along.<br/>\n<br/>\nthey played together dismissing age boundaries, they expanded from being <br/>\nthere only to use the &#39;facilities&#39;, and they were not in the least bit <br/>\nexclusive to other children. <br/>\ni wondered for a couple minutes how they were so different from other kids i <br/>\nnormally see playing there, then it hit me, school is back in so they must be <br/>\nhomeschooled, and they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nit was just so neat how obvious it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23703,"nextTopicId":23713}}
