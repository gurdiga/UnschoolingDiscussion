(Be gentle with me -- it s my first time :-) My ds is now","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1579647501\">I&#39;ve been reading here for several weeks and haven&#39;t seen this situation <br/>\naddressed, so here goes.  (Be gentle with me -- it&#39;s my first time :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds is now almost 15 and liberated himself from the educational system a <br/>\nyear and a half ago, after being rather brutally oppressed by that system for <br/>\nover 8 years.  By the time I snapped to the reality and to our options, and <br/>\nby the time I convinced everyone (including him) to give hs&#39;ing a try, his <br/>\nintellectual curiosity and joy for learning, which had always been such a key <br/>\npart of him, had almost completely been extinguished.  Because of the clear <br/>\ndamage done to him and because I identified him as a kinesthetic learner and <br/>\na random-abstract thinker, we embraced unschooling from the very beginning.  <br/>\nOvercoming my own programming, and relaxing through the deschooling process <br/>\nhas probably been our most difficult hurdle, really, but I&#39;m making progress, <br/>\nand his has been nothing short of miraculous.  He&#39;s happy, loves unschooling <br/>\nand free learning, is adjusting beautifully in many, many ways.  I&#39;ve got my <br/>\nbright and eager, irrepressible son back, and for that I will be forever <br/>\ngrateful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve hit a bump, though, and need some input.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been busy with deschooling over the last year and a half, staying <br/>\nconnected to learning through many of the recommended means -- museum trips, <br/>\nwatching movies and reading books of all kinds, late nights watching meteor <br/>\nshowers, simply playing and living, etc.  He has taken the apprenticeship <br/>\nconcept deeply to heart and now works with a local university&#39;s coastal <br/>\nstudies program and with a small computer company, building systems, <br/>\ninitiating these activities on his own.  No problems there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is just recently starting to enthusiastically reach out to opportunities <br/>\nfor more structured learning on his own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s been happening, though, is that he will express an interest in <br/>\nsomething, will make an attempt at pursuing that interest for himself, and <br/>\nwill be unable to follow through effectively.  I wasn&#39;t concerned about this <br/>\nat first, figuring that it was part of the process.  Plus, he was <br/>\nexperimenting.  Not every area of interest was going to work into a genuine <br/>\npursuit, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem now is that it&#39;s happening so frequently, and he&#39;s beginning to <br/>\nexperience some frustration.  Most significantly, he&#39;s now starting to ask me <br/>\n-- with some regularity -- to sign him up for classes in these areas of <br/>\ninterest.  While I am not opposed to classes, in and of themselves, I am <br/>\ncoming to believe that he hasn&#39;t yet developed the necessary faith in his <br/>\nability to learn on his own, and I don&#39;t know how to help him over this hump.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to play the guitar, for instance.  He knows kids who have taught <br/>\nthemselves.  I make sure he has time to hang out with them and that he has <br/>\nthe needed tools.  He has learned some basic chords and tips from his aunt.  <br/>\nHe began enthusiastically enough, but it didn&#39;t come easily and he tells me <br/>\nthat he needs a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to learn basic computer programming.  He begs me to take him to the <br/>\nstore to find self-guided books on the subject.  I also help him find online <br/>\ntutorials.  He plays with these things for an hour or two, it doesn&#39;t come <br/>\neasily, he tells me he wants to take a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe spends a Sunday morning flipping hotcakes for a youth breakfast, has a <br/>\nblast, and tells me he wants to lean more about cooking.  I&#39;m a pretty decent <br/>\ncook myself and could use the help in the kitchen anyway.  I tell him, sure.  <br/>\nWhat would you like to cook?  We could start with Chinese (his favorite -- as <br/>\na matter of fact we&#39;ve cooked a very successful authentic Chinese meal <br/>\ntogether before), but no.  He wants to take a culinary arts class at the <br/>\nlocal community college.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it just me, or is there a pattern here?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve given you enough information (despite the length of this <br/>\npost) to make an accurate diagnosis, so you might want to ask me some <br/>\nclarifying questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me, though, that he is beginning to recover his lively <br/>\nappreciation of learning, but has no faith in his ability to move forward <br/>\nunder his own power.  He falls repeatedly back into the passive posture of <br/>\nthinking that he needs someone else to teach it to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy gut is telling me that he is having trouble overcoming his own ps <br/>\nconditioning, but I don&#39;t quite know how to help him through this phase of <br/>\nthe transition.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny and all ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65587,"nextTopicId":65591}}
