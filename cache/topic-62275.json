Last time <br/>\nhe was there, he picked out &quot;Learning to Read with Phonics: The Hear-<br/>\nSee-Say Approach to Easy Reading.&quot;  I told him that it wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>\nstory, that it was for teaching people to read.  He told me that was <br/>\ngreat, because he wanted to learn to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night he sat down at the table with the book and listened to all <br/>\nthree tapes.  They were awful.  It sounded like a teacher from some <br/>\nnightmare class of six-year-old prisoners.  She&#39;d say, &quot;Now children, <br/>\nwhat sound does A make?&quot;  and all the kids would say in unison, &quot;A <br/>\nsays /a/ as in apple.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen she&#39;d tell them to read the column of words, and they&#39;d all <br/>\nsay, &quot;apple, at, and ...&quot; in unison. (You know that Pink Floyd movie <br/>\nwith all the kids in their school uniforms?  It was like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why my son kept listening.  He was following along in <br/>\nthe book, too.  So I just stayed out of it and figured maybe it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem weird to him, or maybe he likes hearing the kids&#39; voices <br/>\non the tape. Or maybe he&#39;s learning phonics and that will unlock <br/>\nreading for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the third tape was done and he closed the book and said, in <br/>\na voice that sounded very much like a teenager (though he&#39;s still <br/>\nfour years old), &quot;Now _that_ was _truly_ scary!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62245,"nextTopicId":62294}}
