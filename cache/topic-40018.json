Someone recently told me, however, that the laws are<br/>\nstarting to be challenged.  Wouldn&#39;t know, since my reading skills aren&#39;t up<br/>\nto German language news.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwelfth Night would be the start of the church liturgical season of<br/>\nEpiphany, which is the one that immediately precedes Lent.  The day before<br/>\nLent begins, Ash Wednesday, is the day of Carnival (Fasching, Mardi Gras,<br/>\nShrove Tuesday, whatever you call it).  However, some folks, like thems in<br/>\nNew Orleans &lt;g&gt;, like to get an early start on their partying, and begin as<br/>\nsoon as the appropriate season begins.  So actually both answers are<br/>\ncorrect, although in the Shakespearean sense, I belive that we&#39;re talking<br/>\nabout Twelfth Night as Epiphany, or the Feast of the Three Kings, rather<br/>\nthan a jump on party season!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40017,"nextTopicId":39977}}
