NOt to say in any way, <br/>\ntheir behavior was excusable or justifiable.

In fact, the Warren family -- whose 14-year-old son killed two <br/>\nteen-aged siblings and then himself in July 2001 -- had chosen to duck North <br/>\nCarolina&#39;s homeschool law. CBS News could show no evidence that the Warrens were <br/>\ntypical of homeschoolers, or that this senseless tragedy would have been averted by <br/>\nmore educational regulations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT CBS OVERLOOKED<br/>\n<br/>\nIn North Carolina, homeschooling has grown from a few dozen families in 1984 <br/>\nto nearly 29,000 this year. Considering there are well over 100,000 N.C. <br/>\nparents and children in home education today, a two-year-old tragedy involving a <br/>\nsingle family -- already in trouble -- is so rare and remarkable that it defies <br/>\nlogical connection. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other facts which CBS failed to mention; for example, there were <br/>\nalready numerous child protection laws and regulations on the books that state <br/>\nagencies could have used to safeguard the Warren children. Social Services had <br/>\nnot only contacted the family on numerous occasions -- they had already <br/>\nremoved the children from the home for a time. In spite of all the laws and agencies <br/>\nin place and involved, the system was still not able to prevent the deaths of <br/>\nthese children. And besides that, long before the tragedy occurred, the <br/>\nfamily had consciously dropped out of compliance with the homeschool statute, and <br/>\nfrom that point on they were simply truant from the public school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven then a truant family, with a criminal record in another state, already <br/>\nreported to Social Services by their neighbors and receiving regular contact <br/>\nfrom them -- how many rules, how many systems, how much intervention does it <br/>\ntake to prevent an unpredictable and senseless tragedy? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a family chooses to disregard the law entirely, how could more rules help? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how can such a singular case guide policy toward 100,000 other citizens <br/>\nwho comply with the existing law? <br/>\n<br/>\nTHE REAL STORY<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real story is that homeschooling is a proven path to educational <br/>\nachievement and preparation for adulthood and citizenship -- without government <br/>\nfunding, assistance, or direction. Our organization, North Carolinians for Home <br/>\nEducation, has a twenty-year history of service to the homeschool community. Tens <br/>\nof thousands of parents and students have attended our conferences, seminars, <br/>\nand other events, and we are privileged to know large numbers of these <br/>\nfamilies personally. And we know that first-hand observation confirms the reports of <br/>\nnumerous scholars and researchers -- these are strong, active, and law-abiding <br/>\nfamilies, producing a generation of bright and sociable graduates -- <br/>\nwell-equipped for college, career, or families of their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n( CONTINUED )<br/>\n<br/>\nThe case highlighted by CBS News was not a matter of educational choice, but <br/>\nof murder and suicide -- motive unknown -- and something far more serious than <br/>\nwhether students learn phonics, or which algebra book they use, or even <br/>\nwhether taught by their parents or by government-certified educators. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one family has chosen to disregard the law, there is no logic to <br/>\ntightening a regulatory vice on 29,000 North Carolina families that do play by the <br/>\nrules. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd using old news to suggest that parents who desire the freedom to choose <br/>\ntheir children&#39;s schooling arrangements are part of a sinister pattern of <br/>\nabuse, neglect, and worse -- to coin a phrase, it simply doesn&#39;t add up. Maybe CBS <br/>\nNews should review their notes.<br/>\n<br/>\n#####<br/>\n<br/>\nFOLLOW UP CONTACTS:<br/>\n<br/>\nCBS Evening News:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:evening@...\">evening@...</a><br/>\nViewer comment lines: (212) 975-3247 or (212) 975-4321<br/>\n&quot;Eye On America&quot; Story Date:  October 13, 2003<br/>\nCorrespondent:  Vince Gonzales<br/>\nProducer:  Barbara Pierce<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth Carolinians for Home Education <br/>\n(919) 790-1100 or <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nche.com\">http://nche.com</a><br/>\nPresident Hal Young <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:president@...\">president@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCBS Evening News program sponsors<br/>\nSee the page of links at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nche.com\">http://nche.com</a><br/>\n##########<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth Carolinians for Home Education was founded in 1984 to promote <br/>\nhomeschooling as an excellent educational alternative, to protect the right to <br/>\nhomeschool in North Carolina, and to provide support and encouragement for families <br/>\ninterested in home education.
