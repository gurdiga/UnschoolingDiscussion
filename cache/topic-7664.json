We learned about some of the over 2,000 species of plants growing<br/>\nthere. We also learned a little about the field of horticulture.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Horticulture offers many great ways to earn a living. You create<br/>\nbeauty for people to enjoy. Most likely, you&#39;ll work outdoors. You may<br/>\nescape office politics. You may enjoy the intrinsic simplicity of manual<br/>\nlabor; the chance to sweat, to always wear grubbies, and to get plenty of<br/>\nexercise without paying for a health club membership. You may enjoy a<br/>\nfascinating life-long journey of learning and discovery about plants, soil,<br/>\nand the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Our local botanical garden office had a rack of brochures including<br/>\none from the horticulture department of a community college. We learned that<br/>\na person can earn a certificate in horticulture after just nine months of<br/>\nstudy. At the current tuition rate, that would cost right around $1600! Not<br/>\na bad price for some fourteen courses in subjects such as chemistry,<br/>\nlandscape design, plant identification, mathematics, and writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n        On the other hand, if you connect with someone already in the field<br/>\nwho can be your mentor, you may be able to learn the trade without attending<br/>\nclasses. For the disciplined self-learner with a share of passion, this<br/>\ncould be the ideal way into the field.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Along with many job opportunities, horticulture offers more than a<br/>\nfew entrepreneurial possibilities. I knew a woman in Indianapolis who had a<br/>\nsuccessful business which supplied offices with indoor plants. She would<br/>\ndeliver the plants to the offices, tend to the sick plants, and handle any<br/>\nother plant needs of her customers. As a carpet cleaner, I&#39;ve had many<br/>\nfinancially successful customers, including self-employed florists, an<br/>\narborist, a lawn care specialist, and a nursery owner.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Some years ago, I spent a summer working for a lawn care service. It<br/>\nwas tough work, but always immensely satisfying to see the finished product.<br/>\nThese days while driving around town on carpet cleaning business, I can&#39;t<br/>\nhelp but notice the many groundskeepers, including specialty gardeners who<br/>\ndesign, plant, and tend beautiful landscapes. Such businesses are solid<br/>\nyear-in-year-out businesses. Typically, once customers discover that you are<br/>\nconscientious, hard-working, and charge a fair price, they may become your<br/>\ncustomers for life. And they send their friends to you as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Horticulture is just one of many examples of honorable, soulful, and<br/>\nfinancially rewarding fields of work which don&#39;t require high entrance fees.<br/>\nIt proves that you needn&#39;t take on debt, earn a degree, or be in a status<br/>\ncareer in order to have an interesting occupation, and succeed financially.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen\">http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Make visible what, without you, might perhaps have never been<br/>\nseen.&quot;--Robert Bresson</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7663,"nextTopicId":7668}}
