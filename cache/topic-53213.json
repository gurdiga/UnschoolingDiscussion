If I think about it, I can already see where<br/>\nhis current interests could turn into a life should he want to go that way.<br/>\nBut so what, at this age.  I&#39;m not in the least bit worried about him living<br/>\na productive, meaningful life as an adult.  What he&#39;s into right now could<br/>\nturn out to be his life&#39;s work, or more likely, it&#39;ll be a couple of cool<br/>\nphotos in the scrapbook that he looks at when he&#39;s an adult doing something<br/>\nhe&#39;s not yet even imagined doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that some people live to work.  They LOVE their work, and it is<br/>\ntheir life.  Other people work to live.  It pays the bills and enables them<br/>\nto do what they want to do in the world.  I won&#39;t be upset if my son goes<br/>\neither of those routes.  My goal is that he knows himself and likes himself<br/>\nfor who he is.  Anything else he needs can be learned when he decides he<br/>\nneeds it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53182,"nextTopicId":53223}}
