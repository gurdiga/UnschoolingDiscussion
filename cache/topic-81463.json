I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2059308994\">Konos was too conservative for us...the curriculum tended emphasize a very conservative Christian viewpoint.  Thus, it attracts very conservative people.  I guess someone could use Konos and omit those parts, but that isn&#39;t how it played out in our co-op.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our family doesn&#39;t fit into that conservative Christian mold, so I had to discussion some things as soon as we got in the car to go home...eg. the earth was created in 6 literal days and was no more than 10,000 years old.  The final straw for me was (this wasn&#39;t in the curriculum, but just the interpretation of the woman who led the WWII unit) when the mom taught the kids that the Holocaust really didn&#39;t happen...or if it did happen, then it was greatly exaggerated.  I was speechless. I had never met anyone personally who thought the concentration camps were a sham.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I said something to the &quot;teacher&quot;...I just couldn&#39;t be quiet. But the woman just dismissed me as someone who was brainwashed by the public school system.  She said, &quot;And I suppose you think the Civil War was connected to slavery, too?&quot;  I could see there was no point in discussing this further with this woman. There was no room in our co-op for opposing viewpoints.  I later found out that she was in the Daughters of the Confederacy and a Christian white supremacist group.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  As soon as my kids and I were in our car, I immediately told them that I had a very strong difference of opinion on this one and that I didn&#39;t think we should continue with the co-op.  I said I wanted my kids to talk to some friends at Quaker meeting who did have first hand knowledge of WW II and Nazi Germany.  My kids were getting a little tired of the conservatism, lack of freedom for kids to express their opinion, etc. so they agreed that we should stop our involvement.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dee,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know I&#39;m chiming in late on this.  What a horrible experience you had!  I want to comment because I would describe myself as a conservative Christina - independent, fundamental.  I&#39;m sure that conjures up all sorts of things in your mind based upon your experiences with other conservative Christians.  My core faith has remained constant over the years, but I am very much an unschooler, too, with a respect for the child as an individual.  I find TCS, attachment parenting, and unschooling consistent with biblical teaching and God&#39;s grace and love - it is more biblical in my belief than the strict misinterpretations about child rearing that I observe in some fellow believers.  My children have noticed that they often receive less respectful treatment from both children and adults of similar faith.  We spend a lot of time de-briefing as well.  My children have a more relaxed, less competitive, less arugmentative time when playing with children in an eclectic group.  This saddens them and me (not that they have a good time, but that they don&#39;t have that same experience in a faith-based group :).)<br/>\n<br/>\n  While I have heard of people who do not believe in the holocost, I never imagined such an individual could be found in a homeschooling group teaching young children.  How disheartening!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I want to thank you and others on the list who consistently show grace and acceptance to those of different faith.  As you and others have observed, this is sadly not common in individuals of my faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Annette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Konos","postDate":"1064872718","msgId":81777,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJsYTl1ZStoaDNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJCOUUwOTlDLjFGMTBFJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":81767,"nextInTopic":81791,"prevInTime":81776,"nextInTime":81778,"topicId":81463,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeah, there is  :( There is a separatist, isolationist, glorify- Victorian-era-anything group out there, and that s sad.

Whew.  Konos consumed MY life.<br/>\nSure, my kids had fun doing some of the activities. They will tell you that they have some nice memories, but would never do it again because it was all parent-driven and too conservative.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKonos was too conservative for us...the curriculum tended emphasize a very conservative Christian viewpoint.  Thus, it attracts very conservative people.  I guess someone could use Konos and omit those parts, but that isn&#39;t how it played out in our co-op.<br/>\n <br/>\nOur family doesn&#39;t fit into that conservative Christian mold, so I had to discussion some things as soon as we got in the car to go home...eg. the earth was created in 6 literal days and was no more than 10,000 years old.  The final straw for me was (this wasn&#39;t in the curriculum, but just the interpretation of the woman who led the WWII unit) when the mom taught the kids that the Holocaust really didn&#39;t happen...or if it did happen, then it was greatly exaggerated.  I was speechless. I had never met anyone personally who thought the concentration camps were a sham.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI said something to the &quot;teacher&quot;...I just couldn&#39;t be quiet. But the woman just dismissed me as someone who was brainwashed by the public school system.  She said, &quot;And I suppose you think the Civil War was connected to slavery, too?&quot;  I could see there was no point in discussing this further with this woman. There was no room in our co-op for opposing viewpoints.  I later found out that she was in the Daughters of the Confederacy and a Christian white supremacist group.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAs soon as my kids and I were in our car, I immediately told them that I had a very strong difference of opinion on this one and that I didn&#39;t think we should continue with the co-op.  I said I wanted my kids to talk to some friends at Quaker meeting who did have first hand knowledge of WW II and Nazi Germany.  My kids were getting a little tired of the conservatism, lack of freedom for kids to express their opinion, etc. so they agreed that we should stop our involvement.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI see the Konos moms every now and then, and they usually say something about how wonderful Konos is.  They believe Konos is the only way to homeschool.  The revisionist mom is very cool toward me. She probably still refers to me as the brainwashed mom. LOL.<br/>\n <br/>\nI probably got burned out sooner than some because the moms in my co-op always wanted me to teach science units.  It was a lot of work just hauling microscopes and other science stuff from my lab to the car to my home back to the car to the coop back to my home and back to the lab. They brought Debbie cakes and Kool-Aid as their job. I might have lasted longer if that is all that I had to do. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, because it was parent-driven, I had to deal with kids who didn&#39;t really care at all about the science topics we were covering, even though we did some fun activities.  The kids always wanted to be entertained because that is what Konos was about in our coop.  The Moms were the entertainment.<br/>\n <br/>\nI had planned what I thought was a really cool activity with marbles and ramps to teach physics.  My son was into physics at the time.  The kids didn&#39;t want to build ramps and didn&#39;t want to talk about physics.  The activity ended with kids of all ages throwing marbles around the room.  I think the kids had a lot of fun with those marbles, but I could have saved myself a lot of time and just brought a big bag of marbles! <br/>\n <br/>\nThere may be a way an unschooling kid could use Konos as an idea book, but we didn&#39;t find it useful. <br/>\n <br/>\nDee<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo!
