She has a multiplication/division Dinosaur game from<br/>\nScholastic that she loves to play. We don&#39;t rush and she is allowed to<br/>\nuse pencil and paper. Other days she will spend less time, however, the<br/>\nchange has been wonderful. Whenever I run across some math related book<br/>\nor game I&#39;ll pick it up and add it to her &quot;pile&quot;. <br/>\n     Not to say she does not struggle, but the &quot;struggle&quot; is an image<br/>\nbuilding challenge for herself.  She has trouble retaining the<br/>\nmultiplication, but she will now work it out on her own.  She can&#39;t<br/>\nalways remember but she knows she can work the problems out. <br/>\n     We have the same problem with spelling. However, I don&#39;t worry too<br/>\nmuch as her reading level and retention abilities are excellent.
