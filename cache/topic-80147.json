I can&#39;t remember, and can&#39;t find the article <br/>\nanywhere.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  PLEASE email it to me if you can <br/>\nfind it. <br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s on an adoption board, where she&#39;s giving me the &quot;We don&#39;t slam <br/>\nhomeschooling, so just accept that public school is the right choice for me and my <br/>\nfamily and leave it at that.&quot;  These kids are having a terrible time in public <br/>\nschool, and my intent originally was to just present alternatives.  Then I got <br/>\nthe whole &quot;socialization&quot; speech, and the whole &quot;It&#39;s just not for me, I&#39;d go <br/>\ncrazy with my kids home all day&quot; speech.  I don&#39;t want to be in this <br/>\ndebate...but I don&#39;t just want to drop it...it would seem too much like I agree that <br/>\npublic school is OK.  :o/<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80029,"nextTopicId":80268}}
