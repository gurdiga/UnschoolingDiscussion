It doesn&#39;t.  The<br/>\nguidelines are for the benefit of all and so that each person knows what<br/>\nis expected of him/her.  They were workedout together by all of us in<br/>\nresponse to a problem.  That problem was my husband who could not leave<br/>\nthe dishes or laundry undone.  Now, ANYONE who is not pulling their<br/>\nweight, Ron and I included, looses the help and assistence  and perks of<br/>\nbeing an equal until they are back up to speed.  A lot of this happens<br/>\nunspoken, unannounced and without it being a control issue.  Obviously,<br/>\nthis whole list system is not set in stone.  Everything is variable from<br/>\nweek to week but it has really helped us to all be working together<br/>\neffortlessly, instead of being in each otehrs way and all trying to do<br/>\nthe same things at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou all keep talking about giving up control.  I didn&#39;t &#39;give up&#39; control<br/>\nand I am not holding on to control.  I spread it around.  We are all in<br/>\ncontrol now.  And we are all much better friends for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the &#39;educational&#39; aspects, well, they can learn and do whatever,<br/>\nwhenever as long as they are active participant in the family.  If I were<br/>\ncoming into this group with no background, based on only what I have been<br/>\ntold here, I would expect your houses all to look a little like the Lord<br/>\nof the Flies.  I know they don&#39;t.  I know that you have led and cojoled<br/>\nand manipulated your kids into being decent human beings one way or<br/>\nanother.  It didn&#39;t happen without your input.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am getting tired of trying to explain my family&#39;s dynamics.
