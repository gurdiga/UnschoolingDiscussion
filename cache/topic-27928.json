I realized it was<br/>\nbecause she always did it on Sunday afternoon which meant he would be<br/>\nhome with me before the real symptoms started.  She really believed I was<br/>\nwrong about his allergies because she had not actually seen it.  I<br/>\nthreatened to leave him there for four days if she did it again.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t say it to her directly, I told my dh and he passed it along in<br/>\nkinder words.  But she hasn&#39;t done it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Sat, 17 Nov 2001 21:11:44 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuerst@...\">fuerst@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 1592<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Actually,  I&#39;m using a basically hypothetical example here to  discuss<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; *issue*.
