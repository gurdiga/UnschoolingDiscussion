The main idea behind the blogathon is<br/>\nthat each blogger picks a charity or cause of their choice, gathers<br/>\nsponsors, and then on July 26, posts in their blog every 30 minutes for 24<br/>\nhours straight. Once the event is over, sponsors send their donations to the<br/>\ncharity/cause of the bloggers&#39; choice. You can find out more about the<br/>\nblogathon at www.blogathon.org. This year, I hope to raise money for the<br/>\nSelf Education Foundation (www.selfeducation.org), which is located in my<br/>\nhometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I&#39;m looking for people who are able<br/>\nand willing to sponsor me for the event.

Also, my family<br/>\nis tremendously stressed by dh starting his own business so he is gone a<br/>\nlot but there is no paycheck yet.  I tend to take out my frustrations at<br/>\ndh on the kids and I know that is so wrong!  Ironically, that is how I<br/>\nwas raised, by mom always complaining to me about how mad she was at<br/>\nevery one else but never telling them.  At least I can recognize it, as<br/>\nthat is the first step to changing something.  Dh is a total optimist and<br/>\nwhen I share my frustrations with him he just tells me not to worry, etc.<br/>\n Funny, his optimism was one of the main attractions, and now it<br/>\nsometimes drives me crazy!! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably doesn&#39;t help you any Tracy, but you aren&#39;t alone!
