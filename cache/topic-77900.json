I know I&#39;ve promised and promised to<br/>\n&gt;write this, but, due to some crazy circumstances, I just haven&#39;t been able <br/>\n&gt;to.<br/>\n&gt;First the computer &quot;blew up,&quot; then my cable modem went out (as it would be,<br/>\n&gt;right in the middle of trying to write this letter the last time, and <br/>\n&gt;before I<br/>\n&gt;could hit send).  But, OH well, that&#39;s life, and now I FINALLY HAVE THE <br/>\n&gt;CHANCE<br/>\n&gt;TO SHARE ABOUT MY DAUGHTER&#39;S AWESOME FORTUNE!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To begin with, tomorrow she gets to leave for an AWESOME, probably once in <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;lifetime trip.  Before I say just where, I do want to extend my thanks (not<br/>\n&gt;because I am sending this to anyone there, but because I hope you will all <br/>\n&gt;find<br/>\n&gt;new found respect for them) to the Cincinnati Museum Center and their Youth<br/>\n&gt;Volunteer Program.  If it weren&#39;t for them, this trip wouldn&#39;t even be <br/>\n&gt;possible<br/>\n&gt;for my daughter.  I hope if you live in & around Cincinnati, you will visit<br/>\n&gt;their wonderful Museums & look into the program for your own teens (13 <br/>\n&gt;years and<br/>\n&gt;up).  If you don&#39;t live here, I hope if you come &quot;passing thru&quot; you&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt;decide<br/>\n&gt;to stop for a while (if you do, let me know, my DD, may be able to help you<br/>\n&gt;out with some free tickets).  Mostly, I thank Don Whittrock & assistant <br/>\n&gt;Arden;<br/>\n&gt;they are the ones who chose my daughter for this.  I also thank our <br/>\n&gt;anonymous d<br/>\n&gt;onors!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OK, DO I HAVE YA WONDERING YET, LOL?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tomorrow afternoon (Saturday), she&#39;s living for Red Lodge, Montana near<br/>\n&gt;Billings, Montana (think Yellowstone, National Park).  While she&#39;ll get to <br/>\n&gt;visit<br/>\n&gt;Yellowstone, her main reason for being there is to go on a REAL DINOSAUR <br/>\n&gt;DIG<br/>\n&gt;(LOL, Cheryl, & you didn&#39;t even realize this when you sent the e-mail today <br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt;&quot;never being on a REAL Dinosaur Dig).  All of this was made possible by an<br/>\n&gt;anonymous donor to the Museum Center, who donated ENOUGH MONEY to send 8 of <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;youths from the youth program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;12 were asked to write 4 essays & 1 THANK YOU letter to the Anonymous <br/>\n&gt;Donor.<br/>\n&gt;(The kids did have to be at least 16 to do this.)  They (Don and Arden) <br/>\n&gt;ONLY<br/>\n&gt;chose those who they thought would be best suited for the trip.  Of the 12,<br/>\n&gt;they had to narrow it down (through the essays & thank you letter) to the 8 <br/>\n&gt;who<br/>\n&gt;are going.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My daughter is SOOOOO PSYCHED!  They fly out tomorrow afternoon!  ALL IS <br/>\n&gt;PAID<br/>\n&gt;FOR; FLIGHT, FOOD, LODGING, THE DIG, EVERY ASPECT!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Me?  Well, LOL, I&#39;m so happy for her, but at the same time a bit freaked <br/>\n&gt;out<br/>\n&gt;by the fact that she&#39;ll be flying AGAIN w/out me (then, LOL, you DON&#39;T want <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;be on a plane w/me, either...unless you have me heavily drugged).  Plus, it<br/>\n&gt;isn&#39;t like when she went to Washington, DC this past winter (though I was<br/>\n&gt;freaked out about that too); at least I could have gotten there in under 12 <br/>\n&gt;hours<br/>\n&gt;drive time, and who knows, an hour, maybe 1 1/2 tops by plane).  This is A <br/>\n&gt;LOT<br/>\n&gt;FARTHER away from me than DC!  But, I&#39;d never even try to stop her from <br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt;trip.  This is a once in a life timer for most of us!  I&#39;d never be able to<br/>\n&gt;afford this trip, so she is one lucky kid, and a great essay writer!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BUT, WAIT:  OH YEA, THERE&#39;S MORE!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Most of you know my daughter wanted to work at Paramount Kings Island<br/>\n&gt;Amusement Park (PKI) last year (she was only 15 then, and I told her I <br/>\n&gt;really wanted<br/>\n&gt;her to be a &quot;kid&quot; for one more summer; she listened and did).  She came to <br/>\n&gt;me<br/>\n&gt;in early spring, before PKI opened and asked me to take her to the park to<br/>\n&gt;fill out the application.  Beings that she WAS 16 by then AND it was the <br/>\n&gt;2nd year<br/>\n&gt;in a row she asked, I knew she was serious.  (My one and only &quot;requirement&quot;<br/>\n&gt;was that she had to stick w/it since it was just a seasonal job; that&#39;s our<br/>\n&gt;rule, you start something, you finish it.)  Well, she&#39;s absolutely LOVED <br/>\n&gt;the job<br/>\n&gt;and the job absolutely LOVES her!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All summer, they were giving her responsibilities above and beyond what <br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;give &quot;most&quot; associates; especially her age.  A few weekends ago, she was <br/>\n&gt;told<br/>\n&gt;by another supervisor, that the following day, they were going to put <br/>\n&gt;Kaycee<br/>\n&gt;with one  Supervisors in Charge of one of the mid to large sized picnics <br/>\n&gt;(1000<br/>\n&gt;- 2000 people).  She was required to pre train those who volunteer there,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;place people&quot; in positions she thought would suit them best, schedule <br/>\n&gt;breaks,<br/>\n&gt;lunches, & suppers, and write end of picnic reports (all the while, <br/>\n&gt;watching,<br/>\n&gt;supervising, etc., & helping the workers).  She MUST HAVE DONE WELL!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;At the end of the night, her supervisor (the MAIN ONE) HANDED HER an<br/>\n&gt;application for a Forman position for next year (they&#39;d start training her <br/>\n&gt;this year).<br/>\n&gt;  IT&#39;S REALLY GOOD NEWS when the Supervisor HANDS YOU that application.<br/>\n&gt;Anyone who&#39;s been there once season can apply, but to have it handed to <br/>\n&gt;you,<br/>\n&gt;without going to the office yourself, says a lot!  And, I must say, PKI <br/>\n&gt;does pay<br/>\n&gt;well.  She doesn&#39;t make minimum wage (but, I think it&#39;s good even when kids <br/>\n&gt;do<br/>\n&gt;make Minimum wage; they still learn to work).  On top of the great pay (for <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;kid), she gets a free membership to the park, free food while working, 1/2 <br/>\n&gt;off<br/>\n&gt;food when not, free tickets for friends, (I&#39;d say family, but we always buy<br/>\n&gt;season passes, well except for my brother & his family).  PLUS, she gets a <br/>\n&gt;40%<br/>\n&gt;discount on ALL PKI Merchandise.  She also gets other perks like discounts <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;other local amusements, like canoeing, dining out, etc.  They also have <br/>\n&gt;&quot;after<br/>\n&gt;hours PKI ASSOCIATES ONLY&quot; work parties where the supervisors run the <br/>\n&gt;rides,<br/>\n&gt;and they get to ride and eat all the junk food they can.

I find that my son recalls just fine when <br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s interested, but when he pressures himself to finish or read a certain <br/>\n&gt;thing, he just has no retention. &gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I find the same - for me and my sons! lol!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last year, one of my sons read through a Physics and a Chemistry text that <br/>\n&gt;were on our shelves. He read through them just because he was ( is) <br/>\n&gt;interested in science and he liked the clear explanations in these books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He was following his interests and thus, has retained more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When he got to parts that he felt he didn&#39;t quite grasp, he asked me <br/>\n&gt;questions,. I know little about science but I found that, if I asked him to <br/>\n&gt;read aloud the section he was pondering, then I was able to help him break <br/>\n&gt;the explanation down into little bits. He then *got* these little bits.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think that unschooling is the only way this son can really get into <br/>\n&gt;science, on his own schedule. One of his older brothers is into manga and <br/>\n&gt;gaming and does the same amount of reading for his interests. They are both <br/>\n&gt;learning through unschooling - high school age or not...Leonie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 02 Aug 2003 08:49:17 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: Barb Eaton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homemama@...\">homemama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: BRAGGIN&#39; RITES!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tracy,<br/>\n&gt;     What an opportunity and fun trip!
