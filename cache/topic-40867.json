My only point was<br/>\nthat while my posts were vociferously portrayed as OT, even as they were<br/>\nbeing defended and discussed, the reason given was they didn&#39;t pertain to<br/>\nunschooling. That opinion has been dismissed, partly because, as you say,<br/>\nthe posts have led to much diverse conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a responsibility to God to teach your children about God and the Bible.<br/>\n&gt; How do you do that  with unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe that&#39;s parenting, not &quot;schooling.&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;values,&quot; not education<br/>\nin the secular, state-required sense. It&#39;s about morality, duty, personal<br/>\nethics and virtue, not academic knowledge or skill. Unfortunately, some<br/>\nparents believe they have God&#39;s permission to beat their children....that&#39;s<br/>\nanother story, but relevant, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also seem safe to say that a parent who is &quot;convicted&quot; will pass those<br/>\nconvictions to the child even without explicit instruction, and in fact that<br/>\nis probably the best way -- simply to demonstrate virtuous behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known people who have done that -- simply demonstrated exemplary<br/>\ncitizenship, sportsmanship with forgiveness, clarity, fairness, and what<br/>\nhappens is that they attract people to themselves who often can&#39;t help but<br/>\nwonder how they became such fine people. At that point, the person looks at<br/>\nhis/her feet and modestly says that, well, I just try to follow the<br/>\nteachings of the Bible, or Jesus, or maybe it&#39;s Buddha or Krishna or Ghandi<br/>\nor Kahlil Gibran or Einstein<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nIf all economists were laid out end to end, they would not reach a<br/>\nconclusion.   -- George Bernard Shaw</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40866,"nextTopicId":40868}}
