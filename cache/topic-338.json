They&#39;re all alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950&#39;s technobrain, ever<br/>\ntake a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him<br/>\ntick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a hacker, enter my world...<br/>\n<br/>\nMine is a world that begins with school... I&#39;m smarter than most of the<br/>\nother kids, this crap they teach us bores me...<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn underachiever. They&#39;re all alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in junior high or high school. I&#39;ve listened to teachers explain for the<br/>\nfifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. &quot;No, Ms. Smith, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t show my work. I did it in my head...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn kid. Probably copied it. They&#39;re all alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool.<br/>\nIt does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it&#39;s because I screwed it<br/>\nup. Not<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t like me... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I&#39;m a<br/>\nsmart ass... Or doesn&#39;t like teaching and shouldn&#39;t be here...<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn kid. All he does is play games. They&#39;re all alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the<br/>\nphone line like heroin through an addict&#39;s veins, an electronic pulse is<br/>\nsent out, a<br/>\nrefuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is it... this is where I belong...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know everyone here... even if I&#39;ve never met them, never talked to them,<br/>\nmay never hear from them again... I know you all...<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They&#39;re all alike...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou bet your ass we&#39;re all alike... we&#39;ve been spoon-fed baby food at school<br/>\nwhen we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through<br/>\nwere<br/>\npre-chewed and tasteless. We&#39;ve been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the<br/>\napathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but<br/>\nthose few are like drops of water in the desert.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the<br/>\nbeauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying<br/>\nfor<br/>\nwhat could be dirt-cheap if it wasn&#39;t run by profiteering gluttons, and you<br/>\ncall us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after<br/>\nknowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without<br/>\nnationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build<br/>\natomic<br/>\nbombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s for our own good, yet we&#39;re the criminals.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of<br/>\njudging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime<br/>\nis that<br/>\nof outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but<br/>\nyou can&#39;t stop us all... after all, we&#39;re all alike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nH4ppy H4ll0w33n pUmpk1nh3adz,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe P0sse.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":147,"nextTopicId":305}}
