Many <br/>\nuniversities take homeschooled students.  It&#39;s easy to research the <br/>\nuniversities your son is interested in to see what their admission <br/>\nrequirements are.  Just call the admissions office, tell them you are <br/>\nhomeschooling your son who is interested in attending there, and ask them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut. . . Pre-med programs are very competitive and you son will need a solid <br/>\ngrounding in the sciences. . . and good SAT scores wouldn&#39;t hurt. That <br/>\ngrounding in the sciences doesn&#39;t have to come at the cost of unschooling, <br/>\nthough.  :-)  If your son is motivated to learn, say, biology there are ways <br/>\nfor him to learn without resorting to schools or school-at-home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKarl Bunday&#39;s website at:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html\">http://learninfreedom.org/colleges_4_hmsc.html</a>  is <br/>\na good resource.  It lists 650 colleges that have accepted homeschoolers.  <br/>\nCafi Cohen&#39;s book &quot;And What About College? : How Homeschooling Can Lead to <br/>\nAdmissions to the Best Colleges & Universities&quot; might be helpful to you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you might be interested in David and Micki Colfax&#39;s books <br/>\n&quot;Homeschooling for Excellence&quot; and &quot;Hard Times in Paradise&quot;.
