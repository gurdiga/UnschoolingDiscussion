They make sure the site is reserved far <br/>\nenough in advance. We try to get a group site because it is more fun to <br/>\nall be together on a group site than all in individual sites, but we <br/>\nhave such an overflow that we have to do a lottery for who gets into <br/>\nthe group site and everybody else gets their own individual sites in <br/>\nthe same general area. The organizers order wood (we can&#39;t collect <br/>\nwood, maybe you can). The organizers bring a big white board for people <br/>\nto write what they plan to offer for workshops - so I might put, for <br/>\nexample, &quot;Pam Sorooshian - Candlemaking - 3 pm on Wednesday at the fire <br/>\npit.&quot; Every morning there is a circle - announcements, problems (the <br/>\nteens who dyed their hair purple in the bathroom, see the organizers <br/>\nfor supplies to clean it up with &lt;G&gt;). The potluck isn&#39;t organized <br/>\nexcept that they announce the starting time and somebody brings <br/>\nclothespins to clip onto all the dishes that are vegetarian, so people <br/>\nwill know.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople use tents - but a few have RV&#39;s - depends on the campground/site <br/>\nregulations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur group has everyone sign a release of liability form for all the <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the people in the group site - they pay X dollars per person for <br/>\nthe whole week - we generally don&#39;t have people paying by the day <br/>\nbecause it gets too complicated to keep track. The money pays for the <br/>\nsite and for the wood and we ask for a little extra from those who are <br/>\ngoing to kayak, because we pay the guy who brings the kayaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s about it. The organizers sometimes will make <br/>\narrangements for something special - but usually that is left to the <br/>\nattendees - a docent-led hike or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - at the group site everybody kind of puts their cooking setup in a <br/>\nbig circle - tables end to end, with stoves, etc. It is friendly that <br/>\nway - since when you&#39;re camping you can spend a fair amount of time <br/>\nhovering around your cooking area.  And somebody sets up one big <br/>\ndishwashing area and different people sign up to be in charge of that <br/>\nfor each meal - that means they get it ready before the meal, keep the <br/>\nhot water coming while people are washing their dishes, and clean it <br/>\nall up when people are done.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou never know what is going to go on at a campout - all depends on who <br/>\nshows up. Some have lots of teenagers and some have mostly little kids. <br/>\nSo at some campouts everybody stays up half the night singing around <br/>\nthe campfire or telling scary stories while at other campouts everybody <br/>\nis off sleeping in their tents very early.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is often a talent show one night.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 16, 2004, at 11:50 AM, Jill Parmer wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; pam wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Having said that, these campouts fill up - campgrounds always have<br/>\n&gt; limited space and the HSC campouts are extremely popular - and more<br/>\n&gt; campouts would be very very welcome.
