Kirby (19) is <br/>\nteaching karate four hours a week now (up from one), and supposed to be going to <br/>\nadult classes twice a week.   &quot;Supposed to&quot; means is invited and encouraged.  <br/>\n He went Monday for two and a half hours and Wednesday opted out to go to a <br/>\ngaming night.   He worked every day this week at Dion&#39;s pizza, at least three <br/>\nhours a day too.   Last night he was part of the volunteer set-up crew for a <br/>\nHalo tournament at a hotel in town, and was there most of the day.   He didn&#39;t <br/>\ncome home last night (I didn&#39;t really expect him to), and there was e-mail this <br/>\nmorning letting me know where he had stayed and that the tournament was <br/>\nstarting at 10:00 a.m.    He called late afternoon to tell me he was out, one <br/>\nfriend was still in, and he would pick up the equipment he had loaned when the <br/>\ntournament ended or his friend was out, if they didn&#39;t still need it.   I think he <br/>\ntook one XBox, two TVs and a power strip.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty (16) got more computer memory and so his City of Heroes game is working <br/>\nbetter, and he&#39;s been doing that a lot, and working on some leather armor.   <br/>\nHis part involves sewing.   Keith did some leather tooling on part of it.   <br/>\nPeople at next fall&#39;s conference might get to see it finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly (14) has been doing some art with new gel pens she got for her birthday <br/>\nlast week, watching the first season of Third Rock from the Sun (also a <br/>\nbirthday gift), and chatting with friends online.    She would like to be playing <br/>\nHalo2 tonight she said, but Kirby&#39;s XBox is gone.   Twice this week she&#39;s said <br/>\n&quot;I really miss Kirby when he&#39;s gone.&quot;   She has started making him food and <br/>\ntaking it to him.   He doesn&#39;t ask her to, she just notices that he might be <br/>\nhungry and makes something they both like.

I&#39;ve not <br/>\nmet unschoolers who want minions, mindless souls in need of a spoon-fed <br/>\nlife (if you&#39;re hiding out there, stay hidden!) the most of us (and all <br/>\nI&#39;ve met in real life) want the opposite -- real people who think for <br/>\nthemselves and have a joyful, whole, existence (one they&#39;d gladly repeat <br/>\nover and over for all time). <br/>\n    I&#39;ve joked about this, even called Sandra *the Doddess* -- but my <br/>\nworship of Sandra is for reasons that I doubt this person can <br/>\nunderstand... like the fact that she&#39;s a *real* person who had *real* <br/>\nlife experiences that sucked (and almost sucked the capacity for joy <br/>\nright out of her) and yet she knew/knows that the world can be a better <br/>\nplace for little humans, so she works (not tries, WORKS) every day to <br/>\nensure her children & *OURS* don&#39;t suffer the consequences of our <br/>\nchoiceless childhoods. <br/>\n    Kelly, this is why Live & Learn is the most amazing conference in <br/>\nexistence -- it is REAL time with REAL people living REAL lives sharing <br/>\nREAL joy -- it is Unschooling in Action.  It is where we can come to <br/>\nmeet people (of all sizes shapes and ages) and be inspired by their <br/>\nreality of unschooling.  I would love for all of the Michaels in the <br/>\nworld to come along to Albuquerque, put the notepad aside and just *BE* <br/>\nthere, soaking in the incredible vibes.  THEN, ask about our choices and <br/>\nwhy they matter -- see the proof in the joyous faces of our families, in <br/>\nthe support we give to one another (even when Sandra isn&#39;t looking &lt;g&gt;), <br/>\nthe inspiration our children are to one another...<br/>\n    To inspire and be inspired (freely exchange the word &quot;challenge&quot;), I <br/>\nimagine that is why most of us are here, sharing our lives and our <br/>\nthoughts -- with each other and with our families.  I am a better person <br/>\nbecause of this list, I&#39;m even better than that because I&#39;ve reached out <br/>\nIRL to people this list and the conference have led me to.  My children <br/>\nare happier and healthier than I can imagine I *ever* was (before age 35 <br/>\nanyway ;) all because I have the *freedom* to *choose* this lifestyle. <br/>\n    The whole wide world is about what unschooling isn&#39;t.  Michael <br/>\ndidn&#39;t come here and shine a light onto anything new and exciting.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nlived the world outside of unschooling and I will carry those scars with <br/>\nme forever.  I&#39;m so thankful that unschooling is so very unlike school <br/>\nand our school-centric society, I&#39;m glad to be here by choice (and my <br/>\nchildren are, too!). <br/>\n    So now that I&#39;ve had done to me whatever it is Michael thinks Sandra <br/>\nis capable of doing, I say Thanks, my children say Thanks, and my unborn <br/>\ngrandchildren say Thanks :) <br/>\n<br/>\n:) diana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240085865,"authorName":"NANCY OWENS","from":"NANCY OWENS &lt;nancy-owens@...&gt;","profile":"nancyeddsowens","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] children are people","postDate":"1131832367","msgId":109718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTEyMjE1MjQ3LjExMzgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTEyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzNy4xMDg1MTExLjMwYTZhZTI5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109695,"nextInTopic":109721,"prevInTime":109717,"nextInTime":109719,"topicId":109668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m still 50 some messages behind, but I m sitting here reading the subject line and message, thinking about the past few hours I ve spent catching up, and I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-192942039\">I&#39;m still 50 some messages behind, but I&#39;m sitting here reading the subject line and message, thinking about the past few hours I&#39;ve spent catching up, and I realize how mesmerized I can become. &lt;g&gt; But the funny *I think, but not ha ha funny,* thing is, someone is watching an episode of Family Guy in the other room.
