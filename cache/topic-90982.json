I just waited to see what he&#39;d do. He said &quot;Oops&quot; then picked up the ashtray and asked me to hold it. He picked up the butts and dropped them into the ashtray, then got a wet-wipe and wiped up the ashes from the desktop. Then he said &quot;Thanks&quot; and took the ashtray from me and put it back down where it&#39;d been. <br/>\n <br/>\nI kinda wish Paul had been awake to see it...he can over-react to messes and thinks my non-reacting &quot;well, let&#39;s clean this up&quot; and &quot;making messes on purpose isn&#39;t a good idea because then someone else has to stop what they&#39;re doing to clean it up, or some one could get hurt from the spill or stepping on the toy&quot; kind of attitude is wrong and letting them be irresponsible, etc. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut judging by that...I don&#39;t think so....and overall, here lately Logan is starting to take more care of his things on his own like taking his plate to the sink after eating or offering to help me if I&#39;m doing something.
