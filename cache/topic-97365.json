I have no recollection of that event, but I do recall having<br/>\nthe pervasive feeling all through my childhood that I had no privacy, no<br/>\nright to personal space, that even my clothes and hair were controlled by my<br/>\nmother. I remember begging my mother to leave my laundry on my bed instead<br/>\nof put it away in my drawers when I was 15 years old, just so I could feel<br/>\nlike they were my drawers.

We have now been here for 7 years!<br/>\nAmazing to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t want Bekka to blame Jason for the change in relationship with<br/>\nmy mom (for I believe after a conversation I had with my sister last night<br/>\nthat this is the &quot;idea&quot; my mom is planting in my daughter&#39;s head.)

Spend your afternoons holding up objects for your Mom to say &quot;sell&quot;, <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;give to so-and-so&quot;, etc.  Maybe a live auction if you don&#39;t want to sort it  yourself?  If your Mom understands the financial situation properly, she might be game for something like this (and she would feel <br/>\n<br/>\nlike she is contributing!).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ*******<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL!  I have considered this...  I need to get mom to agree :-)  She&#39;d probably make a killing if she would.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*****Well this is clearly a more complex situation than I understood ****<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn - yes, I know! That&#39;s why I tried to explain a little more without bogging down in all the &quot;details&quot;.  It&#39;s such a mess right now!  <br/>\n<br/>\n****What is magic about January to move, instead of, say, tomorrow. *****<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it is the guilt of leaving my mom with the mess she&#39;s in.  I figure if I give her a date that I&#39;m moving then at least she can&#39;t say that I sprung it on her or didn&#39;t give her time to get organized and ready to sell, etc...  (she can still say that, but at least I won&#39;t believe it) I guess I&#39;ll feel less guilty in leaving her like that.  Also, I am trying to &quot;prepare&quot; my daughter, as she does not handle change terribly well - I repainted her room 3 1/2 years ago to a lovely pink (from a hideous neon green) and she STILL brings up the fact that she wasn&#39;t asked and doesn&#39;t like it... (I won&#39;t make that mistake again - lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if she&#39;d read anything on unschooling, etc.  She needs glasses so I suspect that will be her reason not to read at this point.  I&#39;m sure some of her problems are with the programming she&#39;s been through for 50 some years...  It (unschooling, etc) has been an adjustment for me, even though it all makes sense and has been my &quot;thinking&quot; for a long time before I discovered it was something people actually did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t mind getting married tomorrow, and neither would Jason.  Part of waiting is letting him finish his flight training without the distraction of a new wife.  He will go through 3 months of intense training from March to June.  I think he fears that he will be neglectful of his wife, or that I may not deal well with his &quot;inattention&quot; - lol.  It will be hard enough afterwards being a new commercial pilot and having to move and deal with schedules, etc...  The other part of it is not wanting to freak out our families in what they would think as too soon - not that they rule that decision ultimately, but we want it to be a joyus occasion with our families or at least as guilt free on our parts as possible.  While right now we are planning on next year this time, I suspect we will move the date up.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I thought the transition from my mother&#39;s place to a place for just me and Bekka and later to our new place as a new &quot;family&quot; would be smoother than the transition straight to a new home and mom&#39;s new hubby...  I don&#39;t want Bekka to blame Jason for the change in relationship with my mom (for I believe after a conversation I had with my sister last night that this is the &quot;idea&quot; my mom is planting in my daughter&#39;s head.)  I know there will be problems as it is, but the influence of my mother on my daughter will be lessened if I am not living with her for a time.  That&#39;s my thought anyways (if anyone has a similar experience I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing your story...)  Also, I&#39;m trying to save up and pack without rushing around like a mad woman.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy ex husband and I separated when Bekka was 2 1/2 mos. old - he disappeared out of state and we divorced 2 years later.  He has refused to be invovled in her life for a myriad of &quot;reasons&quot; (which is ultimately better for her as he is NOT healthy), so I am not worried about the issue of dealing with her father since Bekka has never had a father to &quot;miss&quot; or think that Mamma will remarry...  The issues I worry about is the whole getting used to living with someone new thing and the eventual &quot;authority figure&quot; Jason will represent...  Though I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best term to use, but I hope you know what I mean.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
