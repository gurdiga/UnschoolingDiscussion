My<br/>\nson, now 11, has known about menstrual periods as long as I can remember.<br/>\nIt was just part of the bathroom thing like peeing and pooping.  He knew I<br/>\nhad periods before it ever occured to him to be embarassed about it, so, it<br/>\nis quite a natural process for him now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that although I am a rather prudish person in my way<br/>\nof dressing, I have felt quite comfortable talking to my son about sexual<br/>\ntopic as he brought them up.  Answering only what he asked has always<br/>\nworked for us. As he is a question asker, we have covered just about<br/>\neverything in this way (but not wet dreams yet, as I don&#39;t really<br/>\nunderstand them and I&#39;ve asked my husband to talk about it, and I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink he has yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnita<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 05:49 PM 4/11/2000 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    Intellectually, I knew my son was growing up.

Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>\nare put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>\nchemical free.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, who will stop ranting now %-}<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tamilooch@...\">Tamilooch@...</a><br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Parental Crisis <br/>\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, April 11, 2000 12:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello, <br/>\n&gt; This board has been quiet for a while.

This spotting may or may not be the<br/>\nbegining of her periods and I think it might be a little premature to be<br/>\ntalking about GYN visits and tampon use. First of all, if it is her periods<br/>\nstarting her pediatritian can help, I know I sarted my periods 3 years<br/>\nbefore my first GYN visit and you probably don&#39;t need a doctor at all. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure about tampon use in 8 year olds, but I would imagine if you&#39;ve got<br/>\nyour periods it&#39;s o.k. to use them. They do make a junior size. Also<br/>\nremember that the spotting could be from something else. I remember when my<br/>\ncousin was young she fell onto the cross bar of her bike and bled vaginally<br/>\nfor a few days. And, barring any injuries ( which I&#39;m sure she would have<br/>\ntold you about) there can be other physical contidions (such as uti&#39;s and<br/>\nrectal fisures) that could have produced the bleeding. That&#39;s where the<br/>\npedi. would come into play. My 7yo. dd had acouple of days of spotting a few<br/>\nmonths back. Nothing ever came of it and she did not start her periods. I<br/>\nhope I&#39;m not going on too much here. What ever the situation turns out to be<br/>\nI wish you and your daughter luck.

I read somewhere that girls are starting periods at an <br/>\nearlier age than when their mothers did, and that we, as daughters, may have <br/>\nstarted a little earlier than our mothers.  My mom is in her late 50&#39;s, and <br/>\nstarted at about 16.  I am in my mid 30&#39;s and started at 13.  You said you <br/>\nstarted I believe at 11, so maybe at almost 9, your daughter&#39;s system has <br/>\n&quot;kicked in&quot;.  She does seem uneasy talking about it, so giving her some books <br/>\nis probably a good idea, however, I would suggest these books were not too <br/>\ngraphic and intended for older readers-- maturing physically does not always <br/>\nequal maturing mentally.  I was uneasy talking openly about it with my mom, <br/>\ntoo, so looking at books helped me understand in a way that was comfortable <br/>\nto me.  She, too, was always there for me; she gave me the birds and bees <br/>\ntalk, and then gave my bro and me a 4pc set of books on how the body <br/>\nchanges--both boys and girls.  My bro dove right into them... I would look at <br/>\nthem by myself in my room...he would ask a thousand questions... I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember asking any!  I&#39;m not really sure how old we were, but I know we were <br/>\nin the middle-upper elem grades.  I think you are thinking this out, and <br/>\nhandling it just fine!  There are probably lots of moms who  feel they are  <br/>\nnot exactly ready for their daughter&#39;s puberty, especially when it seems to <br/>\ncome on early... trust yourself to handle it in a comfortable way for your <br/>\ndaughter and yourself, I know you will do fine!                                 <br/>\n                                                                                <br/>\n            Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lisa Bugg","from":"&quot;Lisa Bugg&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kt5yFnA2vRxC2EkQk-XkwKs_4u1HQFwWn5UWledeKKk1qrvtgHjS4TujaVr1lIRcPgQW93Cm5cev_sJXE23Hi96D-zvwd2EDCArdcfM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Parental Crisis","postDate":"955481724","msgId":8016,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWJmYTNlZCQxNWU1Nzg4MCQxYjY2YzFhOEBlZHVjYXRlPg==","referencesHeader":"PDMzLjM5ODk5YWUuMjYyNGQxYWNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8017,"prevInTime":8015,"nextInTime":8017,"topicId":8016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"?

She might not spot<br/>\nagain for a year or more.  9-10 is not too young for the first signs of<br/>\npuberty.  At early 10 my first daughter put on a layer of fat all along her<br/>\ntorso.  This is normal. They use it to in the up and coming hormone<br/>\nproduction and to make breast and hips out of. &lt;G&gt; I would take processed<br/>\nchicken and as much dairy as I could out of her diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have done the important part. You have informed her, provided resources.<br/>\nShe knows she can com to you when the idea has had time to sink in and for<br/>\nother body signs to be noticed.  Now you have to do the hard part and let<br/>\nthings unfold at their own pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8088,"nextTopicId":8019}}
