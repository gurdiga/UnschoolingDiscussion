We have more space than ever, <br/>\nwhich will allow us to  have both an art room and a gaming room in addition to <br/>\nout program space. The  hotel has a full health club with an Olympic size pool. <br/>\nThere are hiking trails  right nearby. We have negotiated with the hotel so <br/>\nthere will be free internet  access in all conference attendee rooms (normally <br/>\n$10/night). It&#39;s very handy to  Boston with a  free shuttle to the commuter <br/>\nrail in case you want to explore without worrying  about parking your car. <br/>\nI urge you to reserve  rooms as soon as you can. We have run out of rooms at <br/>\npast  conferences. <br/>\nI&#39;ll have more details  about presenters and funshops and other things soon, <br/>\nand I&#39;m still taking  proposals.  <br/>\nKathryn Baptista <br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the  Northeast Unschooling Conference August 27-30, 2009 in <br/>\nWakefield, Massachusetts  _www.northeastunschoolingconference.com_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n**************AOL Search: Your one stop for directions, recipes and all other <br/>\nHoliday needs.
