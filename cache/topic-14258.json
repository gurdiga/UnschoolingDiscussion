I wanted to expand on them a <br/>\nlittle. We all choose a path in our life and when someone thinks they have <br/>\nfound a small spark of truth it is very hard not to let everyone know about <br/>\nit. The hard part is to do it in a respectful, loving, caring way. We all <br/>\nput our foot in our mouths to many times. I have personally tried to choose <br/>\na life path of love, compassion, and nonviolence to all. I believe their are <br/>\ndefinite universal rights and wrongs. I try to live a life abiding by those <br/>\ntruths. I don&#39;t feel exceptions can be made for these universal truths. Does <br/>\nthis mean I cannot treat people in a caring, empathetic way? Does this mean <br/>\nI feel I am above everyone else? No Way! For example, if I feel <br/>\nhomosexuality is wrong does that mean I cannot speak to homosexuals and have <br/>\nto shun them? Does that mean if I do talk to them I am not being truthful to <br/>\nmy own beliefs? The answer once again is a big fat no! &quot;All men are created <br/>\nequal.&quot; So if I were to met a homosexual it would be wrong of me to treat <br/>\nhim with any less dignity, empathy or compassion than I would the Pope. We <br/>\nare all one in the same on different life paths. We are created by one <br/>\ncreator, connecting us all together. On the same note, it would also be my <br/>\nresponsibility when a mutual opportunity became available to express my <br/>\nfeelings respectfully and with love on homosexuality. If I did not I would <br/>\nnot be living and abiding by my own truth. This is the only way to make <br/>\nchange in such a chaotic world. Everyone knows the story of the &quot;Good <br/>\nSamaritan&quot;, it is possible to be a caring neighbor to all without giving up <br/>\nany of your own beliefs. Arguing and preaching will never accomplish <br/>\nanything. It is only love, compassion, and truth that will break down these <br/>\nwalls.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] to each his own<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 29 Nov 2000 12:14:37 EST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 00-11-27 16:23:35 EST, you write:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; There&#39;s an auto-faulting mechanism in protesting.<br/>\n&gt;   A public, vocal protester cannot in good faith say &quot;to each his own.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;To each his own&quot; starts at home, and doesn&#39;t make placards.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt;Sandra, sorry, you could say a little more about what you mean here?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When people are strident and inflexible they can&#39;t then say &quot;to each his<br/>\n&gt;own.&quot;  A person can&#39;t really (for example) be a serious fundamentalist<br/>\n&gt;Christian and then say &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t fault you for your religious beliefs&quot;<br/>\n&gt;unless that other person is a born again Christian.
