The situation is a little more complex than my questions in the email I sent but they were the &quot;right&quot; questions. It was my son that I was asking for but he was adopted by and is living with my sister (I was 15 when I had him). Her opinion on hsing, &quot;I could never hs!&quot; My son is getting bored at school, he may be at risk of going in a bad direction if something doesn&#39;t peak his interest soon. He lighted up when I mentioned 14 year olds can take college classes. He wanted me to ask about hsing/unsing to find out what his options are, so that maybe he can work up a proposal that my sister would agree with. The tidbit about Washington state was great, that is where they live. No one is pushing him towards this, it is completely his own and I agree, may change, no biggy. This was a conversation we had recently on that: Me-when did you decide you wanted to be a dr.? Him-I don&#39;t know, when I was a kid. (me snickering, a kid? haha) Me- Oh and people heard and are holding you to it, eh?  Him-No, I&#39;m holding me to it. Any way, for all you who made it this far-lol- my deepest thank you! Oh, I did cross post these two emails, sorry if that bothers anyone, not my intention at all.:) <br/>\nTonia<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mox@...\">mox@...</a><br/>\nHammond, OR<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m a man and I can change, if I have to, I guess.&quot; -Red Green show-PBS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/DeschoolingAdults\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/DeschoolingAdults</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1342,"nextTopicId":1345}}
