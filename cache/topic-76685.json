Kids harvested the lettuce, now <br/>\n2 pumpkins are in the house, picked blackberries and blueberries, <br/>\ninvestigated the brand new sprouts in the cucumbers, tomatoes, and <br/>\nwatermelons.  That is not even touching the flowers that were all <br/>\nplanted with seed.  They made a strawberry pie.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe visited the K-9 training center and had a great FIELD TRIP!!! <br/>\nWatched and learned all about dog grooming, the kennels, cattery, and <br/>\nthe grounds/equipment that is used.  Also, on the front page of one <br/>\nof the local newspapers, unbeknownst to us, was a feature of a family <br/>\nthat is attempting to persuade a neighboring county to invest in a K-<br/>\n9 unit.  AWESOME &quot;reading&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone here in Missouri??<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76664,"nextTopicId":76676}}
