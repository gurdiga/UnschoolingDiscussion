Its always fun to talk about ones kids, especially when they&#39;re called (and by none other than Sandra Dodd!) amazing!   <br/>\n<br/>\nKira, now 21, attended a Waldorf school through the fifth grade, homeschooled the next year, went back to Waldorf for seventh grade, then never went to school again. She was homeschooled at first, then she unschooled (note: she  unschooled, not she was unschooled!)<br/>\n<br/>\nShes had the travel bug for several years and left a couple of years ago to go on an Amtrak adventure by herself (gulp). Within two days she met Anton, a soulmate who was doing a similar trip, and they have been together ever since. Shes leaving soon on another adventure, this time by herself (she loves him, but really feels the need to have a chance to be totally independent while shes young).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started a homeschool theater group several years ago and Kiras directed some of the plays and written music for them. Lately shes been more focused on her own personal writing and on earning money for the trip In a couple weeks shell be on a panel of adult homeschoolers at a homeschool conference and will be the only one whos not in college or. <br/>\n<br/>\nBryn, 18, attended a Waldorf school through the second grade, then homeschooled/unschooled until her senior year (last year), when she made the decision to attend the Waldorf high school for her senior year. She wanted a high school experience before it was too late, and, for her, it was a great decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nBryns an artist and a singer and doesnt plan on going to college this year(shes working). Shes pretty sure shell be going next year, though--either an art school or a regular college with a good art program.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis summer my husband and I suddenly realized we have an all-adult family now, and we took our very first vacation ALL ALONE (since the girls were born, I mean). It was only for four days--sort of a maiden voyage--and it was so weird/wonderful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have older kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23950,"nextTopicId":23774}}
