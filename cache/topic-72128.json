It looks like it will probably be in August, but the exact dates<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;location aren&#39;t final yet. In the meantime, I have a few questions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a question - why is the conference in August? We usually try not to<br/>\n&gt; do any big traveling in the summer when all the people who are slaves to the<br/>\n&gt; school schedule are doing so. Airfare is often more expensive (we&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt; coming from the other side of the country), and to be honest, for people<br/>\n&gt; from a temperate climate, the eastern seaboard heat and humidity and pretty<br/>\n&gt; off-setting at that time of year. Is there any reason the unschooling<br/>\n&gt; conference can&#39;t be in, say, late September? Better weather, less<br/>\n&gt; travelers...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, again, this is not definite, but there are a couple of reasons. One is <br/>\nentirely selfish: I am off from my job in the summer, and we start up the <br/>\nsecond weekend in September. I am expecting there will be a LOT of work right <br/>\nbefore the conference, and it will be a pain in the butt if it&#39;s during the church <br/>\nyear.  I also looked at Spring. Also a pain in the butt time for work, but <br/>\neasier to work around than fall.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, late September starts high season in this area, and I&#39;ve chosen this <br/>\narea because, well...I live here and it will be easier to get volunteers, work <br/>\nwith hotels, etc. The Salem, MA area is VERY congested in late-September <br/>\nthrough October, and all the prices go up. Also, if we want to do Whale Watches, <br/>\netc... Better not to wait too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if someone else wants to take over the major planning in another <br/>\ngeographical area, that&#39;s fine. (I don&#39;t mean this in a snotty, &quot;Well, FINE, you <br/>\ndon&#39;t like my plan, then you do it&quot; sorta way. I am seriously open to someone <br/>\nelse doing this in New England, and would even help, but if I&#39;m doing most of <br/>\nthe work I have this strong preference for making it as easy as possible for <br/>\nmyself.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72107,"nextTopicId":42764}}
