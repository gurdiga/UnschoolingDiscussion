His Dad was very distant and often angry. He remembers being afraid of him. It was very touching to hear him talk about how he has learned to see his Father through more than just the eyes of a child, because it&#39;s helped him heal.<br/>\nHe realized many of the things you listed, his father did so much better than HIS father did by providing for and being there for his family. And Rev. Jamie is SUCH a spiritual, peaceful individual, so it ended with him (unfortunately not his siblings though).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Grandfather was raised by a mean, abusive, alcoholic father and a clueless mother. He went out on his own at 14 and never lived at home again. He struggled in this world and built a good life for himself. My mother remembers him being fairly harsh (but also loving) when they were little, I also remember some of his rougher side.<br/>\nMy mother did a little better, she yelled but was very loving and fun too. I carried some of that anger into my parenting, but it&#39;s going away....so just three generations from the alcoholic, abusive one you have attachment/peaceful parenting.<br/>\nMy Grandpa has urged all of his Grandkids not to spank.
