Her ds was in a living hell while in school, and so much happier now, she&#39;ll do anything to protect him from that. <br/>\nI can&#39;t give her a whole lot of advice,not having been in the situation myself. I only know the laws here, but not how they apply in a case like this. They have shared custody, but she has the bulk of the law on her side, I believe she&#39;s listed as the primary guardian (or however they word it).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, if anyone that has dealt with this type of thing feels inclined to offer some support or advice, I&#39;d really appreciate it.
