Glen, Lane<br/>\nand I regularly attend Kung Fu classes, while Nancy, Lane and I attend Tai<br/>\nChi classes (about 1 year now). We fell in love with the place and went from<br/>\nstruggling to squeeze in classes twice a week to going there almost every<br/>\nday. I was pleasantly surprised that they took to it so well since they had<br/>\nnever been involved in organized sports or strenuous physical activity<br/>\nbefore.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast August, the owner of the studio told us that she had some family health<br/>\nproblems and couldn&#39;t keep running the school. She said that it would close<br/>\non Sept 1st if she didn&#39;t find someone to take it over. We couldn&#39;t imagine<br/>\ntrying to find another place to train, so we gave up replacing our van<br/>\n(after all, it&#39;s only 15 years old and has less than 230,000 miles on it)<br/>\nand instead bought the school. We sometimes jokingly tell people that we<br/>\nliked the classes so much we bought the school for our kids! It&#39;s kind of<br/>\nstrange owning a martial arts school and actually still being a student who<br/>\nisn&#39;t even a black belt yet, but fortunately we had good instructors already<br/>\nin place.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, last weekend, Lane and I competed in the USA National Open Martial<br/>\nArts Tournament. Glen had been planning on competing too, but was sick all<br/>\nweek and didn&#39;t attend any classes. Although he was feeling better on<br/>\nSaturday, he wasn&#39;t feeling ready to compete and decided to be a spectator<br/>\nand part of our cheering section instead. He apparently did a very good job.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the women&#39;s division, Lane (13) competed in tai chi forms and won gold<br/>\nwith her 18 step Essence form, competed in tai chi weapons and won gold with<br/>\nher straight sword form, and competed in sparring and won gold.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the men&#39;s division, I (46) competed in tai chi forms and won gold with my<br/>\n18 step Essence form, competed in empty hand forms and won gold with my<br/>\nShaolin Fist form, and competed in sparring and won gold.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, Lane and I performed together in the two-man fighting set<br/>\ncompetition (like regular forms, but with 2 people in kind of a<br/>\nchoreographed fight sequence) and won gold.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left after our events were over (it was a long day and we were stopping<br/>\nby the grandparents before heading home) and didn&#39;t wait to see the finals<br/>\nor find out who the grand champions were for the tournament (usually a black<br/>\nbelt grand champion is the highest award, then an under belt (non-black<br/>\nbelt) grand champion is also selected). Anyway, I later got a call from the<br/>\ntournament organizer informing me that I was the under belt grand champion<br/>\nof the tournament! He&#39;s even going to come out to deliver the trophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have another big tournament coming up in DC on July 3, then will be<br/>\nmarching in the Severna Park (Maryland) Independence day parade on the 4th<br/>\nand performing demonstration at the Park Plaza shopping center after the<br/>\nparade. Wish us luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find more details on the tournament and some photos of us at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jingying.org/tournament/2005_usa_nomat.htm\">http://www.jingying.org/tournament/2005_usa_nomat.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly Greer<br/>\nwww.FUN-Books.com <br/>\nSpecial sale on Rosetta Stone products<br/>\nnow in progress!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107116,"nextTopicId":50328}}
