There are good ones.  One way to do your homework is to go <br/>\nto your state Ombudsman&#39;s office and ask them for recommendations.  <br/>\nAn Ombudsman&#39;s job is to speak for the residents when the resident <br/>\ncan&#39;t speak for themselves.  They visit the residents of the <br/>\nfacility every week and ask them how things are going.  If things <br/>\nare not going well, they try to mediate between the resident and the <br/>\nfacility (they are always on the resident&#39;s side).  They also send <br/>\nweekly written reports to the state licensing agency which the state <br/>\nuses when they do their annual survey of the facility.  They know <br/>\nwhich ones are good to their residents and which ones are in it for <br/>\nthe cash.  If you go into any nursing home or rest home the <br/>\nOmbudsman&#39;s name and phone number will be posted.

I cook and serve<br/>\nbreakfast and lunch, do light housekeeping such as<br/>\nmaking beds, emptying trash, wiping out sinks, and am<br/>\nalso a back up caregiver.

Perhaps you<br/>\ncan rent out a/another room to another single mother<br/>\nwith a similar aged child (and with similar parenting<br/>\nstyles).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is obvious that your daughter *needs* more<br/>\nattention from you.
