I am constantly vascilating between feeling<br/>\nabsolutely confident in my choice to being petrified that I am somehow<br/>\nfailing my children.  The closer we get to high school (both turning 13 this<br/>\nyear), the more I panic.  I have to bolster myself and remind myself that I<br/>\nmade an educated decision to unschool because I believe in my heart that<br/>\nthis is the best choice for my children.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\nSarah\r<br/>\nHomeschooling mama to Amanda 12 1/2, and Ashleigh 12 1/2\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75937,"nextTopicId":75871}}
