This is my<br/>\npersonal experience.  As an adult, my bowel movements are just fine<br/>\n(LOL).  I have kept my distance from my mother for many years.  I find I<br/>\ndo much better emotionally and physically (in that order!).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note:  In no way would I ever suggest that constipation is only<br/>\ncaused by parental control issues.  I&#39;m sure there are many different<br/>\nmedical reasons that would cause constipation.  One reason, I have<br/>\npersonal experience with.  One of my sons is a Juvenile Diabetic.<br/>\nConstipation is a sign of dehydration which is a sympton of Juvenile<br/>\nDiabetes.  Once the diagnosis was made, on his first birthday, and he<br/>\nstarted his insulin injections, his constipation went away.  So, my<br/>\nadvice to any parent whose child suffers from constipation is to have<br/>\nthat child&#39;s blood sugar tested immediately.  Juvenile Diabetes is a<br/>\nserious hereditary disease which should not be ignored.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; *<br/>\n&gt; ************************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. -<br/>\n&gt; Janice<br/>\n&gt; Levy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                    Yahoo!

Though we have sweets and snacks<br/>\nhere, my son is more likely to eat fruit.   There have been days when he<br/>\nsnarfed a lot of  &quot;junk&quot; foods,  and more days when he turns it down.   <br/>\n<br/>\nExperts have been telling moms for years that kids &quot;need&quot; limits.  They<br/>\nare can only feel truly safe and loved when they have limits.  That can<br/>\nbe hard to get past.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe moms can know their kids very well.  I also have seen plenty of<br/>\nmoms who just think they do.  Maybe a kid gets grumpy if he watches TV<br/>\nall day.  But maybe he&#39;s grumpy because he didn&#39;t get anything to eat. <br/>\nMaybe he didn&#39;t feel good in the first place and that&#39;s why he chose to<br/>\nsit and watch TV.  Maybe he chose TV because he couldn&#39;t think of<br/>\nsomething else and he&#39;s grumpy because he&#39;s frustrated.  Maybe he&#39;s<br/>\ngrumpy because mom keeps saying &quot;are you just going to sit there all<br/>\nday??&quot;    I think it&#39;s easy to assume it&#39;s the TV because after all, we<br/>\nall  *know*  TV is bad for kids!( they need limits!)    On an unschooling<br/>\nlist, I don&#39;t see the harm in asking, - are you sure it was the TV--<br/>\nmaybe you didn&#39;t think of this other reason.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI also know,  when our decisions are questioned all the time, it&#39;s easy<br/>\nto become defensive.  Many of us have friends, family members and even<br/>\npartners who don&#39;t support our choice to unschool.  One more person<br/>\nasking a question can feel like an attack,  when it was really just meant<br/>\nto be a question,  something to consider.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what anyone on this list, or anywhere else,  says or thinks or<br/>\nimplies,  we all still have the ability to make our own decisions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nControlling kids is a huge issue.  Some people use their religion as an<br/>\nexcuse,  some people just like the power, some people just never think<br/>\nabout it.  Telling someone else what to do, what to think, what to eat,<br/>\nwhat to wear, how to behave--these are control issues.  Questioning them<br/>\nseems appropriate on an unschooling list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this one true thing.  My own son is delighted to be alive.  He&#39;s<br/>\nhappy to be a kid. He has no issues, no problems.   He is free to make<br/>\nhis own choices.  <br/>\nWhen someone says their child is unhappy or unhealthy,  I know there<br/>\ncould be a million reasons for it, but I&#39;ve seen so many examples of the<br/>\nreason being control of the child&#39;s life by the parent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Tz5BLm2dnSdzcdiGT6LIBt0MMUzOTkk7U4Ugv07p5L8cYJw0tduz6bBzdpwOfXPeizCUFcxf0OXl4AfhI7APm8BIfkAWXMAtkjRAVLBXyA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Control causing medical conditions","postDate":"1006122109","msgId":27963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCRjgzNDdBLkJBRDYzRDQ2QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDE0ZS40Mzg2MTA0LjI5MjkzZmM5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27950,"nextInTopic":27967,"prevInTime":27962,"nextInTime":27964,"topicId":27934,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And another time, at <br/>\nher house, she told Marty, who was three or four, that since he hadn&#39;t <br/>\nfinished his plate, he couldn&#39;t have the dessert, which was a tiny portion of <br/>\ncarrot pudding, and I said &quot;Marty, you can have mine,&quot; and pushed it right <br/>\nover to him and he ate it.  I never even bothered to look at the mother in <br/>\nlaw who criticizes us for buying whole milk instead of skim, for using butter <br/>\ninstead of margarine, and for not depriving our kids to teach them to endure <br/>\nhardship.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother-in-law&#39;s way did not work.  It didn&#39;t earn her her desired results, <br/>\nand her sons have bad memories of food issues in that house.  They learned to <br/>\nget jobs and eat elsewhere, and be dishonest about that fact, because she <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t feed them between meals, she controlled portions, and shamed people <br/>\nconstantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read, years ago in Mothering Magazine, an article about a family that <br/>\nallowed choices of foods.  It was a more limited situation than mine, but the <br/>\nauthor&#39;s point was that children will come to their own balance.  That has <br/>\nbeen true with my kids, and other families I&#39;ve talked to who have done the <br/>\nsame things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joseph Fuerst","from":"&quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"CAzVdacylrQ_G3CfwgO_BoTdJGaxrW9FXNX8yoF5oyMo8iTFzYJx2DGY4K0K3ru2UnwsCr1FuFM5EMV2ASKYwf4n9AD2UTUW","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Control causing medical conditions","postDate":"1006101263","msgId":27934,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWMxNzA0ZSRlMWRjZjljMCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDYwNjU1NjAuMjUyOC4xNDY0Ny5tNkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27937,"prevInTime":27933,"nextInTime":27935,"topicId":27934,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
