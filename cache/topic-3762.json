I&#39;m American, but Ilive in Japan.  My son gets English<br/>\nfrom me (so your friend could just speak her native language) and<br/>\nJapanese from everybody else - Dad, neighbors, people at the store, at<br/>\nchurch, etc.  He speaks both just fine.  The children&#39;s &quot;instruction&quot;<br/>\ndoes not have to be in English (or the official language of the<br/>\ncountry).  Until recently (just because I&#39;m too pregnant to get around<br/>\nanymore) we participated in an international group around here, and Mook<br/>\n(ds) got his &quot;instruction&quot; in different languages each time we went.  He<br/>\ncertainly doesn&#39;t speak them all, or even understand what they&#39;re<br/>\nsaying.  What he has learned, however, is that not everybody in the<br/>\nworld speaks the same language, has the same skin color (here that would<br/>\nbe black hair, slanted eyes, etc.), or the same culture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3718,"nextTopicId":3763}}
