I recently","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-441601695\">For the most part, I have enjoyed this list.  I have personally benefited<br/>\nfrom the exchange of ideas and have a new respect for differing views.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently read something that made me think of some of the things going on<br/>\nhere on the list recently, and I want to share it.  This quote has helped<br/>\nme, maybe it will help someone else.  Here&#39;s my two cents worth to this<br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaken from Joe Alexander&#39;s book Blatant Raw Foodist Propaganda! (yes, I&#39;m<br/>\nthe one who often comments about the health delights of raw food):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mental prejudice is one such internal restraint.  The mind likes to run in<br/>\nthe groove it is accustomed to; in the ruts it has worn deep.  To be free<br/>\nsometimes requires an effort to pull the mind out of its habitual rut and<br/>\nset it to exploring new territory.  The most common form of mental bondage<br/>\nis the confusion of information with knowledge.  Your knowledge is what you<br/>\nknow is true from your own experience.  Information is hearsay that you have<br/>\npicked up and don&#39;t know if it is true or not.  The fool will say, &#39; If you<br/>\ndon&#39;t accept Jesus you&#39;ll go to hell forever.&#39;  The wise person might say,<br/>\n&#39;I know a preacher who says that if you don&#39;t accept Jesus you&#39;ll go to hell<br/>\nforever.&#39;  A fool will say, &#39;I know that light travels 186,000 miles a<br/>\nsecond.&#39; A wise person might say, &#39;My high school science book says that<br/>\nlight travels 186,000 miles per second.&#39;  A free person will not confuse his<br/>\ninformation with his knowledge.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize for the Biblical reference which may offend some Bible-believing<br/>\nindividuals - this is the author&#39;s statement, not mine.  You or I might word<br/>\nit differently or choose a different example.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, sometimes it is helpful to me in staying emotionally detached when<br/>\nI view a person&#39;s statements on the list as &quot;I know a person who<br/>\nthinks/states/believes  that . . .&quot;  Sometimes, I&#39;m even able to sit back<br/>\nand enjoy the back and forth of others without jumping in even though I do<br/>\nhave a specific, even strong, opinion on the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let&#39;s keep up the dialogue, it really helps to see both or two or three<br/>\nsides of things sometimes.  Even the hardened mind [mine ;-)] sometimes<br/>\nlater changes, and the seed was planted long ago by someone with whom I once<br/>\nvehemently disagreed to the point of making a fool of myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"debbie jones","from":"debbie jones &lt;dljones0@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4RvRkRct0rgUkBP-mPco4WXQAucnykqTb8nYtHKI8a9D87rmCPxClad96kjlXVzl9-jriGxoPnI4yG_76IT_CDJTJHO41zNP","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] offensive/defensive posts","postDate":"990650643","msgId":21851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNTIzMjA0NDAzLjkxNzM4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjExNjA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNmLjZlOWQ1MzUuMjgzZDcwZmVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21844,"nextInTopic":21888,"prevInTime":21850,"nextInTime":21852,"topicId":21832,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" &gt;&gt;&gt; If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then make a change.
