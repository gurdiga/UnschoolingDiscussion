I <br/>\n&gt; may be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re wrong! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron, my fifteen year old, doesn&#39;t need any more direction than my seven <br/>\nyear old. And in three months, he won&#39;t even need me to drive!<br/>\n<br/>\nHis typical day begins after 10:00. He&#39;ll fix himself a bagel or toast or <br/>\ncereal. He usually spends an hour or so at the computer editting the movie <br/>\nhe&#39;s working on. He wrote the screenplay and directed his friends in it. He <br/>\nhas several hours of tape and so far only fifteen minutes of movie---LOTS of <br/>\n&quot;wasted&quot; tape.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he&#39;ll spend an hour or two outside skateboarding. He&#39;s happy to bounce <br/>\n(on the trampoline) whenever his brother asks. He&#39;s also game for any board <br/>\nor imaginary game that Duncan wants to play. As soon as it warms up, they&#39;ll <br/>\nspend a lot of the day in & around the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lunch, he might ask that we go driving---that&#39;s if we don&#39;t have <br/>\nsomewhere to go anyway; then he always drives. He had no problem with the <br/>\nwritten test to get the permit. I can&#39;t forsee any problems with his getting <br/>\nthe restricted license either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe spends two-three hours a day playing the drums. They were a Christmas <br/>\ngift, and he&#39;s amazingly good---without lessons of any kind. He&#39;s going next <br/>\nweek to Spartanburg to spend the evening with the drummer for the Marshall <br/>\nTucker Band.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe usually does little things around the house to help me. He likes to empty <br/>\nthe dishwasher. I hate it---so that&#39;s a big help. He almost always picks up <br/>\nthe den and starts a load of laundry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes his room VERY neat. He recently redesigned & redecorated his room. <br/>\nHe painted the walls and then painted the logos of his favorite group on the <br/>\nwall---shadow images. It is SO cool! He also took photos of the band last <br/>\ntime they were in town, then cropped and enlarged them, and got the band <br/>\nmembers to sign them. They&#39;re also on the wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes to draw and create, so he often has paper nearby for new ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe LOVES his music, and there is hardly a minute that goes by when he&#39;s not <br/>\nlistening to music.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe and I went to see Arlo Guthrie Sunday night. I was totally enthralled. His <br/>\nband consisted of his son, Abe, his daughter, Saralee, and his son-in-law, <br/>\nJohnny. Major cool to see the family up there! Cameron wasn&#39;t <br/>\nimpressed---he&#39;s not into folk music (the weirdo! &lt;g&gt;), but he suffered <br/>\nthrough it for me. I told him that, when he&#39;s 40, he&#39;ll get to brag that he <br/>\nsaw Arlo Guthrie in concert with his kids! &lt;g&gt; Then he had to listen to <br/>\nAlice&#39;s Restaurant Massacree all the way home! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, he and I were down for the entire day---some stomach bug. Thank <br/>\ngoodness Duncan can completely entertain and care for himself. Cam and I <br/>\nslept in my bed the whole day in between runs to the bathroom (I guess I <br/>\ncan&#39;t count Monday as a &quot;school day&quot;! &lt;G&gt;). I&#39;m better today, but haven&#39;t <br/>\nseem Cam yet this morning. I hope he&#39;s feeling better!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe spends evenings talking with his friends and IMing them on the &#39;puter. <br/>\nHe&#39;s usually in bed by 2ish after spending some time on the computer or <br/>\nwatching TV or listening to music.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only &quot;direction&quot; I give is maybe, &quot;Take a right at the next light.&quot; He&#39;s <br/>\nperfectly capable of directing himself!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61967,"nextTopicId":61992}}
