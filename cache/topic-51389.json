Maybe someone else can, or you can check with a group in your state.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m wondering if your elder children are having trouble with the<br/>\nidea that Mom&#39;s changed.  They know what they had to do, and therefore their<br/>\nyounger siblings should have to do that, too.  Parents are supposed to stay<br/>\nthe same, so that they&#39;re predictable and boring.  Unpredictable parents are<br/>\ndisorienting, I think, to people whose lives are going through lots of<br/>\nchanges like your children probably are, growing into adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to talk to them more, read some of the things you read to<br/>\nthem, explain yourself, or maybe it would just be easier to ignore them.<br/>\nUnless they do what you do, it&#39;s pretty hard for them to tell you how to do<br/>\nit.  (People here do what you do and we have a hard enough time taking<br/>\nadvice from each other!)<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51388,"nextTopicId":51375}}
