I&#39;ve never encountered anyone who was offended <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t try everything.  And I&#39;ve been to a LOT of meals provided by <br/>\nother people.  I can&#39;t stand most chinese food, so I load up on rice and a <br/>\nfew (very few) other choice items.  I have had another adult suggest I try <br/>\nsuch-and-such but I reply, OH, this rice and whatnot is SO good I don&#39;t have <br/>\nroom for anything else!  This is so wonderful!  I mean it, too, and I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t offended anyone yet! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you want your children to be respectful, thankful beings, but <br/>\nwhat&#39;s missing is genuine sincerity.  You can&#39;t insist that they be <br/>\nrespectful of others or thankful for their offerings.  That is something <br/>\nearned and your children will give their thanks and respect freely to those <br/>\nwho deserve it.  I mean, if the food and service is horrible but the hostess <br/>\nworked for hours to prepare the meal, I wouldn&#39;t thank her!  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nexpect my kids to either.  That&#39;s kind of extreme but it happens!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s amazing how huge the shift has been for you in the past few <br/>\ndays.  I feel confident that if you ease up and begin to enjoy meals without <br/>\nworrying how much *work* they are for you or what the kids will or won&#39;t <br/>\nlike, or how thankful and proper they are, you will be amazed at what a joy <br/>\nmealtimes can be!  (Yes, even if you thought they *were* joyful to begin <br/>\nwith!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?

I started <br/>\nthinking about shifts we&#39;ve made and why we&#39;ve made them. I <br/>\nhave a couple of points I wanted to share.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I want my home to be reality-based.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I mean by this is that I want kids to respond to reality, not <br/>\nan ideal. If the food isn&#39;t tasty, I don&#39;t want them pretending it is. If <br/>\nthey feel irritated that dinner is taking a long time, I don&#39;t want <br/>\nthem to pretend that they don&#39;t mind just to appease me or avoid <br/>\nbeing in trouble. I would hope that they can express those <br/>\nfeelings with an increasing ability to care about the feelings of <br/>\nothers as they do, but even in an immature form, I&#39;d rather they <br/>\nsay &quot;Dinner is taking too long.

I want the kids to feel they can tell me anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem with authoritarian parenting is that kids know who <br/>\ncalls the shots in their lives so they will lie or hide to protect <br/>\nthemselves from outcomes they don&#39;t want. Example: my <br/>\ndaughter went to a sleep-over with four Christian homeschooled <br/>\ngirls. When I picked her up, I said, &quot;How late did you stay up?&quot; <br/>\nShe said, &quot;4:30&quot; Her best friend said, &quot;I&#39;m not telling my mom <br/>\nthat. I&#39;ll just tell her 2:00 a.m. or she won&#39;t let me do it again.&quot; I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;You&#39;d be lying to your mother.&quot; She replied, &quot;She won&#39;t <br/>\nknow.&quot; Blew me away that she&#39;d admit this to one of her mother&#39;s <br/>\nbest friends! (me)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son returned from an overnight where he and his four friends <br/>\nstreaked at 2:30 a.m. and he shared it with me saying, &quot;Please <br/>\ndon&#39;t tell the other moms. They will say no to future overnights.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m seen as the threatening kill-joy in my kids lives, I&#39;ll lose <br/>\naccess to them and any influence I want to have will be gone.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I want my kids to experience reciprocity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we (the parents) violate a child&#39;s sense of justice, I want <br/>\nthe child to feel free to say so, to expect restitution in the same <br/>\nways we want it from them when they damage or violate <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s space.
