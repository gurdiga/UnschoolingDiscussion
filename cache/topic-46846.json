That you&#39;ve set up your role and<br/>\nit&#39;s up to her to fill her role. And the conflict is arising because you&#39;re<br/>\ngiving what you think is necessary rather than what she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m sensing there&#39;s this knot inside of you that says you&#39;ve given what<br/>\nyou can and you can&#39;t/won&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t have to give more. But the message<br/>\nbehind what people are saying isn&#39;t that it&#39;s necessary to give more but to<br/>\nlisten to what she&#39;s telling you by her actions so you can give her what she<br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like you&#39;re speaking two different languages without realizing it and<br/>\nyou&#39;re each getting frustrated that the other isn&#39;t understanding what<br/>\nyou&#39;re saying. And you feel like you&#39;ve thrown as many words as you can and<br/>\nbeen as clear as you can but she&#39;s just not putting the effort into<br/>\nunderstanding you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as someone said even better in a different context, it isn&#39;t up to her<br/>\nto understand your language. It&#39;s up to you to understand her language. (Did<br/>\nsomeone mention The Explosive Child book?)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read any at the Unschooling.com message boards? I think you could<br/>\nget a lot out of what AnneO has to say about honoring children. Her older<br/>\nson has Aspergers which can make children &quot;difficult&quot; but you&#39;d never know<br/>\nbecause she listens to what his actions say he&#39;s needing rather than what<br/>\nsociety has said that kids need. And she&#39;s there with him to help him figure<br/>\nout ways to handle life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You<br/>\n&gt; said you thought you were most bothered by your daughter not cleaning her<br/>\n&gt; room because you&#39;d just spent $2000 on it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I had this revelation when I first started discussing cleaning and cooking<br/>\nand all the things we need to do for our families. The revelation was that<br/>\nwe *don&#39;t* have to do all those things. We get to choose. We don&#39;t have to<br/>\nmake dinner every night. We don&#39;t have to scrub toilets.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we realize we have a choice, we realize that what we choose to do for<br/>\nour families is either a gift that we know they want to receive or a gift<br/>\nthat we want to give them with no strings attached -- in which case perhaps<br/>\nwe should see it as a gift to ourselves. Often we get those two confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike if we want to give them the gift of dinner, then we shouldn&#39;t knock<br/>\nourselves out for 3 hours preparing a gourmet meal. They won&#39;t appreciate it<br/>\nand we&#39;ll resent that they don&#39;t appreciate it. If we want to give them<br/>\nsomething, then we should give them homemade pizza or a picnic in the<br/>\nbackyard or even McDonalds. Something we know that *they* want, *not*<br/>\nsomething that we think they should want and appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want to prepare a gourmet meal, we need to recognize that we&#39;re doing<br/>\nit for ourselves and not for them. So their appreciation isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>\nOnly our assessment in how well we think we did is what&#39;s important.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you truly wanted to give her the gift of a room, it was a room to do<br/>\nwith as she wished. I think what you unconsciously gave her was something<br/>\nthat you wanted which was a certain image of a child&#39;s room that met your<br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you saying that you never provide consequences or &quot;punishments&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for inappropriate behaviors?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Traditional parenting tells us to mold their behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut traditional parenting is very concerned with how well the children<br/>\nappear to others and how convenient the children are to live with.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me the primary concern should be *why* a child is behaving as she is, not<br/>\n*what* she&#39;s doing. If a child is lying or stealing or hitting, there&#39;s a<br/>\nreason behind it. Stopping the behavior doesn&#39;t stop what&#39;s causing it. Just<br/>\nforces into a new channel.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we see kids as inherently bad who need to be taught to be good, then<br/>\npunishment makes sense, I suppose. It would be like pulling weeds. But I see<br/>\n&quot;bad&quot; behavior as either not understanding how their behavior is affecting<br/>\nsomeone else, or because they aren&#39;t yet able to understand, or as a<br/>\nreaction to how they&#39;re being treated, or personality. (Slamming a door is a<br/>\nlot better than punching someone!) Accepting that their needs are different<br/>\nthan ours -- because they&#39;re kids and because their personalities are<br/>\ndifferent than ours -- is often hard, but it&#39;s a pathway to being their<br/>\npartner rather than their trainer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Attitudes and Consequences","postDate":"1035039645","msgId":46874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRhLjFmOWFmNmI5LjJhZTJjZDlkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46849,"nextInTopic":47020,"prevInTime":46873,"nextInTime":46875,"topicId":46846,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1308993117\">&lt;&lt;  You<br/>\nsaid you thought you were most bothered by your daughter not cleaning her<br/>\nroom because you&#39;d just spent $2000 on it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed that before.<br/>\n<br/>\nA group of women I&#39;d known a long time were talking one day, and I said I <br/>\nused to look in the JC Penney catalogs and dream about the matched furniture <br/>\nsets for little girls&#39; rooms--the matching dressers, bookshelves, corner <br/>\ndesk, bed with drawers...

My husband just asked her to please run<br/>\n&gt; downstairs and turn off the tv, because we were all getting settled<br/>\n&gt; down for bed.

The state might punish them for illegal<br/>\nactivity, I personally would not. Punishment doesn&#39;t work for felons,<br/>\nthere&#39;s no reason to expect it to work for children).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When do you finally step in?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never stepped out.
