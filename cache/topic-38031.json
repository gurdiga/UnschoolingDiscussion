If she should live beyond 3 or 4 <br/>\nthen they should place her in a home. It was so sad, beyond words. I never <br/>\nrealized until a few months ago that what our friend does with her daughter <br/>\nis unschooling. She keeps documents and has a &quot;curriculum&quot; of sorts, ( <br/>\nbasically an outline of what she thinks will be good things to work on over a <br/>\ncertain period of time. Like E. D.  Hersh&#39;s books only for her MR daughter.) <br/>\nbecause she is the type to do so, but IMO what they do is unschooling. <br/>\nThey play all day, they sing songs and do the laundry, they count to 10 while <br/>\nrunning the sweeper. She now knows her alphabet, numbers to 10, she can fold <br/>\nlaundry, and loves to listen to her books on tape. She can also run her tape <br/>\nrecorder and the VCR with help. She can make simple sandwiches and fix <br/>\nherself cold cereal. This girl has never been to a school. She had a woman <br/>\ncome out once who evaluated her, but she also recommended an institution. She <br/>\ndoes go to special therapies several times a week and has a group of other <br/>\nchildren like her that she enjoys going to. She can&#39;t speak very well, but <br/>\ndefinitely knows how to get her point across. She knows her pleases and thank <br/>\nyous, and has wonderful manners. She can&#39;t read, but loves books. She can <br/>\npick out clothes that match, she can&#39;t run the washing machine or dryer, but <br/>\ncan sort laundry, load the washer and take the clothes out of the dryer. She <br/>\nhas learned the importance of good hygiene and does her best to keep herself <br/>\nneat. <br/>\nRecently some issues with their local school district came up and our friends <br/>\nreluctantly allowed their daughter to be tested. The results were that she <br/>\nwas untestable, recommendation: institution. Our friends conclusion? She <br/>\nwould have been a sad, uncared for child forgotten somewhere in an <br/>\ninstitution (probably not even alive) if they had listened to all the people <br/>\nover the years. Instead they have a happy child who contributes to the <br/>\nfamily, is loved and loves. She would have never learned even the basics as <br/>\nshe has if placed somewhere. I firmly believe that unschooling can and does <br/>\nwork for everyone. Even a child who will never progress beyond the mental age <br/>\nof 2 or 3. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Assumptions about Disabilities","postDate":"1022962446","msgId":38032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Zi4zMTZmMzdmLjJhMmE4NTBlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38031,"nextInTopic":38037,"prevInTime":38031,"nextInTime":38033,"topicId":38031,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/1/02 12:54:24 PM, dcannon@nctc.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-635817708\">In a message dated 6/1/02 12:54:24 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dcannon@...\">dcannon@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; IMHO (LOL) a child with significant disabilities has all the more<br/>\nreason to be kept away from the self-esteem destructive world of<br/>\ngovernment schools. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was writing about ADD not being a disability in the way deaf/blind and <br/>\ncerebral palsy was, I was talking about UNschooling very specifically.
