May I <br/>\nsay, one of my favorite authors, Douglas Wilson, who runs a classical <br/>\ncollege, and a day school with classic emphasis for younger students, <br/>\nwho is a strong believer in Classical Education...it was from his <br/>\nwritings that I got this: &quot;Classical isn&#39;t for everyone.&quot; (my <br/>\nparaphrase)<br/>\n<br/>\nwow. Profound. LOL Just as, back in &quot;the day&quot; when education MEANT <br/>\ntraining in Latin and Greek, as well as Logic and Rhetoric...back <br/>\nin &quot;the day&quot; not everyone had that education. Some did. Those who <br/>\nwere suited for such an education, excelled in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read about these mothers whose children balk at their lessons, <br/>\nwhose &quot;doing school&quot; means abandoning life (which I&#39;ve been through <br/>\nrecently with K12), and I want to say &quot;What makes you think your <br/>\nchild is SUITED to such a course?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, I&#39;m going to introduce Latin and Greek to my kids...because <br/>\nI bought a book about the roots of English, and I&#39;m going to read it <br/>\nfor myself (being a wordophile, and very interested in etymology) and <br/>\nleave it available for my kids, and maybe even sit with them on the <br/>\ncouch and explore it together. If a spark ignites, well isn&#39;t that <br/>\nCOOL? We can be etymologists together! L <br/>\n<br/>\nBut first, Robby wanted to study the planets, so we visited the <br/>\nlibrary and have been reading about them. He&#39;s already filled his <br/>\nhead with facts about the solar system, and was quizzing a kid at <br/>\nchurch today. Katie wanted to make smiley face cupcakes, so we did.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you know, that writing frosting/gel you can find in the baking <br/>\nsection of the grocery store, when you lay plastic wrap on it, it <br/>\nlifts right off the frosting? L We had a lot of yellow cupcakes, some <br/>\nWITH black smileys, and some WITHOUT. But it was fun and Katie did it <br/>\nall herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward with great anticipation to TOMORROW.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace, Heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56377,"nextTopicId":55844}}
