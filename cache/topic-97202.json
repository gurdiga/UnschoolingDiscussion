I do think the parents are there but not &quot;there&quot; - they spend a lot of time on the internet.  That could be the key.  Any suggestions on how they can start to change their behavior and hopefully get their child to ask for what they need from Mom & Dad?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I am getting it more.  Thank you for the info on principles vs. rules.  It is a shift in perspective/mentality.  I have been raised in the world of rules and restrictions.  I do have trust issues too, and I see how that has filtered through to my daughter.  I am trying... it seems like such a long process!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I lump &quot;unschooling&quot; principles with parenting because the principles seem to be more natural and more along the lines of the type of parent/child relationship and &quot;stuff&quot; that I want my daughter to grow up with.
