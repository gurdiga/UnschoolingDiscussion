The couple of people I know who lived in a<br/>\ncommune ended up eventually having some sort of revelation, that hey, not<br/>\neveryone has the same communal ideas, and some dictator type eases their way<br/>\ninto control. I am not saying that is happening to the communist on this<br/>\nlist(sorry, I forget you name), just what happened to people that I know.<br/>\nAlso, I am not sure if you live in the US.<br/>\nAs far as the reputation of the forefathers, well, to me who wrote the<br/>\nconstitution has nothing to do with its genius.<br/>\nI am curious about an unschooling communist, because that sounds totally<br/>\ncontradictory to me. I  think of Communists as trying to make everything<br/>\nfair for everyone-not saying that I am accurate-just going by the socialists<br/>\nideas in the US.  I don&#39;t understand the liberal view -of preventing someone<br/>\nnot to have what they want- if they are willing to take risks and live on<br/>\nthe edge and go for it. Who cares, if they want more stuff that equates more<br/>\nheadaches and responsibilities, let them live the way they want as long as<br/>\nthey are not hurting others or abusing the land.<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25269,"nextTopicId":25141}}
