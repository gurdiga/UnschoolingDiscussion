Grades can be affected dramatically if a teacher grades &quot;on a<br/>\ncurve&quot;, gives extra credit that is slanted towards things that the teacher<br/>\nmost likes/enjoys, grades for quantity rather than quality, does not take<br/>\neffort or originality into account, is unaware of things happening at home<br/>\nwhich may affect a student&#39;s grade, any many other factors too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis often happens in IS settings, and the child ends up feeling they have<br/>\nbeen cheated and treated unfairly, while paradoxically also having their<br/>\nself esteem negatively impacted.  Even Good grades can have a devestating<br/>\neffect on a child.  I have a niece who is a straight A+ student from day<br/>\none of her schooling.  However, her self esteem is SO centered on getting<br/>\nA&#39;s (as is everyone else around her) that she is devestated by even an A-,<br/>\nwill spend all summer studying a subject to bring her grade up, and had a<br/>\nbleeding ulcer by age 10.
