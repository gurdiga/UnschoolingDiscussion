It&#39;s as if the code is<br/>\nfinally <br/>\n  broken and you&#39;re seeing the words on the page for what they really are. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Mine came while I was reading a Family Circus comic strip.  Thelma (Mom)<br/>\nis <br/>\n  standing in the bathtub holding a part for the plumber, who is working on<br/>\nthe <br/>\n  faucet.  Dolly comes in and says, &quot;That was [so and so] on the phone.  I<br/>\ntold <br/>\n  her you couldn&#39;t talk right now because you are in the bathtub with the <br/>\n  plumber.&quot;  I sounded it out, then again, and suddenly I could just READ<br/>\nthe <br/>\n  whole thing without sounding it out at all!   I just looked at all the<br/>\nwords <br/>\n  on the page at once, and they stood on their own, as if they had come to <br/>\n  life.  I was 4 at the time, I think.  We were on vacation in Kansas City,<br/>\nat <br/>\n  a hotel with a pool on the roof, and my sister threw up in the hallway on<br/>\nthe <br/>\n  way back to our room after dinner that night.  She&#39;d had fish. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"monkeycoop@aol.com","from":"monkeycoop@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XKC_9KZ5tXt-QI4DBIUgk0K_2HIx4shqIQoyx_sVUXsrGPjw6jKOnN41LcUcPElefUY6rjkFXQ0L","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The light bulb moment","postDate":"955329893","msgId":7950,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4LjQyZDc5NmUuMjYyMjg3NjVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7969,"prevInTime":7949,"nextInTime":7951,"topicId":7950,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/9/00 4:44:53 PM Central Daylight Time, Tracy@oldfield.free-online.co.uk writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-785442202\">In a message dated 4/9/00 4:44:53 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tracy@...\">Tracy@...</a>-online.co.uk writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  it sometimes seems to me as if I was born reading!

I view a good book as a friend.  I think that <br/>\nreading can be carried to excess like anything else, but I guess if I had to <br/>\nchoose a vice for my child (as if they won&#39;t choose their own! LOL) I would <br/>\nchoose too much reading.  I probably read too much as a child and teen.  I <br/>\nalways had my nose in a book.  My parents were wise though.  I can&#39;t remember <br/>\nthem ever once telling me to put the book down and go do something else.  I <br/>\nthink this is a good thing for me to remember as an unschooler.  I have to <br/>\nadmit that when my boys have been on the computer for several hours or have <br/>\nbeen drawing comic books for a whole morning, I usually try to redirect them <br/>\nto something else.  Maybe I should trust them to stop when they need to stop <br/>\nbut it&#39;s tough for me not to step in.
