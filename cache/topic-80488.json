The only consistent thing in my life was that you <br/>\ncould not predict anything.  My grandma had me the most and she was <br/>\nnever consistent - sometimes I got a hug, sometimes she turned into <br/>\nthis enormously wrathful monster like Ursula the sea witch and would <br/>\nslap me and call my a gd little b.  I could be behaving identically in <br/>\nboth instances.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one taught me how to safely express feelings, I was taught to be <br/>\ninvisible and unobtrusive.  This sounds excessive, but gosh I talk to a <br/>\nlot of friends who had another flavor of the same dish.  It is hard to <br/>\nlearn these appropriate behaviors on your own, especially when people <br/>\naround you scoff at you like you are acting like a child( my husband <br/>\nand family).  I *am* acting like a child when I have strong emotions.  <br/>\nI just recently figured that out and I am trying to learn how express <br/>\nemotions in a more constructive way.  My husband&#39;s response to a <br/>\nsimilar upbringing is that he has a totally flat effect unless he is <br/>\nbeing goofy.<br/>\nI&#39;d like to figure out a happy medium in time to pass it on to my <br/>\nchildren, but they see my outbursts often enough to have learned <br/>\ntantruming from a pro.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the book &#39;How to behave so your children will too&#39; by Sal <br/>\nSevere, but he tends to make this sound like a cake walk, and assumes <br/>\nthe parent has limitless patience.  Besides I can&#39;t remember more than <br/>\na few points and that I liked the book.<br/>\nI have shelves full of books and wonder why I can&#39;t figure this stuff <br/>\nout.  As I am sitting here, it is dawning on me that I have unrealistic <br/>\nexpectations of myself with all those books - I never learned a thing <br/>\nin school from a book, how can I expect to suddenly learn well from a <br/>\nbook?<br/>\nI like the sound of the non violent communication book - Is that <br/>\nsomething that would come on tape or in a video presentation?<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHeather, mom to<br/>\nHarriet 12.15.99<br/>\nCrispin 01.25.02<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherette@...\">heatherette@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80455,"nextTopicId":80514}}
