It&#39;s by Trey Parker, who does so many of the <br/>\nvoices on South Park.   It&#39;s ridiculously silly, but for families who don&#39;t mind <br/>\nhumor of a sexual and religious and social nature, it&#39;s entertaining.   <br/>\nProbably not for younger kids.    Most people would hate it for being a bad movie <br/>\nand being &quot;about something nasty&quot; I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrey plays the lead.   He&#39;s a Mormon missionary whose mission is nearly <br/>\nfinished, and he wants to have money to marry his girlfriend back in SLC, and is <br/>\noffered a job in a film.   Turns out it&#39;s a porn film with a superhero named <br/>\n&quot;Orgasmo.&quot;   The movie (both the larger movie and the film-within-a-film) has Ron <br/>\nJeremy.   I had known nothing about Ron Jeremy before, but Kirby told me he <br/>\nwas some actual porn guy who&#39;d been in more movies than anyone including <br/>\nChristopher Lee.   Also at Netflix was a documentary about Ron Jeremy, so we got <br/>\nthat and Keith watched it, and I watched it, and Kirby watched it (none of us at <br/>\nthe same time, which might have made it easier to bear).   I&#39;m not <br/>\nrecommending it as something anyone needs to or should see, just showing another example <br/>\nof how one thing led to another.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107005,"nextTopicId":107030}}
