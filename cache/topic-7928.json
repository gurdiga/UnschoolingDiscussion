AND, it is not uncommon for them to adjust to the idea once the<br/>\nlittle one arrives.  So, his opinion may change once the major disruption<br/>\nand all the changes that a pregnancy brings about are behind you and your<br/>\nlittle bundle is actually here and not just a vision.  The concept is quite<br/>\ndifferent from the reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes and happy parenthood to you both!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Ron and Stephanie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ronandstphanie@...\">ronandstphanie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Breastfeeding & champagne moment...    <br/>\n&gt; Date: Saturday, April 08, 2000 10:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; breastfeeding.

Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>\n&gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>\n&gt; feeding?
