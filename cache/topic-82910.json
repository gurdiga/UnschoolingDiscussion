But<br/>\nteachers must not allow this public vote of confidence to lead to<br/>\ncomplacency.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Scottish Executive is currently inviting feedback on its decision to cave<br/>\nin to the vociferous home education lobby. The proposed new guidelines<br/>\nseem to allow scope for a crank to go undetected. More parents may decide<br/>\nto keep children in the four walls of home.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents have been pupils, ergo they are education experts, in much the<br/>\nsame way that telly addicts of medical soaps can self-diagnose all manner<br/>\nof ailments without recourse to so-called &quot;health professionals&quot;. For this<br/>\nreason, surely it is proper that the Executive hands over educational<br/>\nresponsibility to those mums and dads who believe they could do a better<br/>\njob than overpaid classroom duds such as yours truly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be fair, parents already do a wonderful job when their kids are young.<br/>\nThey encourage literacy skills by reading bedtime stories, albeit abridged<br/>\nversions as they miss out every other page to ensure the bonding<br/>\nexperience ends in time for the start of EastEnders. Other kids have<br/>\nnumeracy skills developed at a very early age, e.g. when dad walks out of<br/>\ntheir life, 2 minus 1 equals single parenthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nMater and pater could theoretically teach certain aspects of the curriculum.<br/>\nI’m certain that some hard-bodied, toned-up pecs parents would be able to<br/>\npass on physical fitness techniques but what about the teenagers of the<br/>\nchocoholic, chain-smoking chumps trudging the shopping malls in search of<br/>\nthe nearest McDonalds? It’s a recipe for an even greater rate of obesity<br/>\namong the young.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory lends itself to parental involvement and we are blessed in Glasgow<br/>\nthat so many dads apparently live and breathe dates and events. Go to<br/>\nGovan on match days and see the proud parent with his &quot;1690 No<br/>\nSurrender&quot; scarf while at Parkhead his counterpart strolls along sporting a<br/>\nnatty &quot;1916 Up The ’Ra&quot; tammy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMum could run in-house drama workshops, having gleaned great acting<br/>\nexperience from those occasions when called to the school to account for<br/>\nher child’s behaviour. Some can do &quot;upset&quot; when the headteacher<br/>\nsensitively informs them they have given birth to the anti-Christ. It is right<br/>\nthat drama teachers should be made redundant because anyone can act -<br/>\ncheck out River City - and there is a close link between the popularity of<br/>\ndrama and levels of academic attainment. It’s not an exact science but<br/>\nshow me a school with a large drama department and I’ll show you a school<br/>\nwith poor SQA results.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere would be far-reaching consequences if almost one-third of mums and<br/>\ndads decided to home educate their offspring. For one thing, financing<br/>\nMcCrone would be easier as a result of the massive downsizing in schools,<br/>\nsaving pots of cash for council taxpayers - except for those living in local<br/>\nauthorities that are tied into PPP contracts for the next 30 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a stroke, the issue of class size would be eliminated as a consequence<br/>\nof the mass exodus. Instead of picking up crisp packets and coke cans<br/>\nfrom the playground, janitors would be brushing up tumbleweed blown into<br/>\nghost schools. Fewer kids means fewer fights, less bullying. Gosh, it might<br/>\nresult in fewer teenage pregnancies given the youngsters would have a<br/>\ndiminished partner pool to choose from. Better still, the number of<br/>\nexclusions would fall, offering the Executive the opportunity to declare its<br/>\nsocial inclusion policy a great success.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe prosaic truth is that sales of Prozac would increase a hundredfold if<br/>\nparents had to spend more time with their issue.

It rellly does not matter which group they<br/>\nfall into because they belong to every group out there. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was how I felt about the subject.  Replace the word &quot;homeschooling&quot;<br/>\nwith &quot;black&quot; or &quot;gay&quot; and now you can see what I felt was wrong with the<br/>\nprogram.  The American public fears homeschoolers the way they feared (and<br/>\nstill fear) people of other races, creeds, religions or sexual orientations.<br/>\nIt is not ok for a respected news show to feed into that fear by making it<br/>\nsound like those kids were abused because they were homeschooled, even if it<br/>\ndoes happen sometimes.   Neighbors will now watch neighbors looking for this<br/>\nnew threat.  &quot;Some of my best friends are homeschoolers.  I have no problem<br/>\nwith people homeschooling, but do they have to talk about it in public.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking for more regulations for Child Protective Services is old news.<br/>\nPeople have been there done that.  Asking for more regulations for<br/>\nhomeschoolers is something new and exciting.  CBS slanted the show and<br/>\nfocused on what would boost their ratings.  And it worked.  They got a whole<br/>\nbunch of people who woudn&#39;t have normally watched the show to watch it last<br/>\nnight and a lot of those people are planning on watching it tomorrow.  They<br/>\ngot probably every homeschooler in America within an earshot of the internet<br/>\ntalking about it.  They&#39;ve been flooded today with emails, letters and phone<br/>\ncalls.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83019,"nextTopicId":83025}}
