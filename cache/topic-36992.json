We just played that today!!!<br/>\nWe used to use it in the grief counseling I did, to get the kids warmed up to <br/>\nthe group or to help break down walls.<br/>\nMy 5y.o. had Pizza in just about every one of her answers today...but the <br/>\ngreat thing is, it doesn&#39;t matter! Everyone can just relax and have fun.<br/>\nI was also going to suggest taking the regular games you play and turning <br/>\nthem into cooperative with just a little creativity.<br/>\nMusical chairs is played at our house by taking away a chair each time the <br/>\nmusic stops, but no one ever gets &quot;out&quot;. Everyone just has to fit on less <br/>\nchairs. By the end of the game, everyone piles onto one chair, laughing and <br/>\ngiggling and falling down...it&#39;s great.<br/>\nIf you have a parachute, you can play &quot;shark and minnows&quot;. One person is the <br/>\nshark, one is a lifegaurd and all the rest are minnows. The minnows sit on <br/>\nthe ground holding the parachute, the shark is under the parachute and the <br/>\nlifegaurd stands behind the minnows. The shark grabs the minnows legs and <br/>\npulls them underneath the parachute with him/her....and the lifegaurd is the <br/>\nonly one that can save them. Once you are pulled under you become a shark and <br/>\n&quot;attack&quot; the other minnows. Eventually everyone becomes a shark and you start <br/>\nall over. People can take turns being the lifegaurd (or more than one person <br/>\ncan play lifegaurd...or no one).<br/>\nWe also loved &quot;Sardines&quot; when we were kids.....<br/>\nIt&#39;s hide and seek but one person hides while everyone else seeks. If you <br/>\nfind the person, you climb into the hiding place WITH them. Eventually <br/>\neveryone is crammed into the one hiding place, the last person to find them <br/>\ncan be the person that hides the next time.<br/>\nWe have a book that I can&#39;t seem to find right now. I think it&#39;s called &quot;We <br/>\nAll Win&quot; or something.<br/>\nAnyway, hope that helps.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36960,"nextTopicId":36962}}
