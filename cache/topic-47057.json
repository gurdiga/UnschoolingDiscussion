Go to a field trial and watch the winning dogs. Go to a<br/>\ndog show and look at Best of Breed. Often, they don&#39;t seem to be the same<br/>\nspecies. There are breeds where the breeders do try to &quot;hold it all<br/>\ntogether&quot; and produce working dogs who can also win in the show ring -- the<br/>\nvast majority are not successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this is a point of irritation to me &lt;g&gt;. I have learned to largely get<br/>\nover it, but still...
