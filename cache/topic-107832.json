We have been<br/>\nunschooling (in the strictly educational sense) and I am trying to<br/>\napply the principles of unschooling to our lifestyle as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday I took the plunge and did away with food controls. And my kids<br/>\npromptly binged on a half a bag of Hershey Miniatures. Of course they<br/>\nalso ate grapes and apples and yogurt and tomatoes and turkey. I&#39;m<br/>\nsure they just don&#39;t think that the limits are *really* gone and at<br/>\nany time I might start restricting them again. I&#39;m sure they just need<br/>\ntime to trust that they are *really* able to make their own choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying not to overreact and revert back to the way things have<br/>\nalways been. This is all normal, right? Will things level out after a<br/>\nwhile?
