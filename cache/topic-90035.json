How<br/>\ndo you see this learning process taking place, if the<br/>\nchild isn&#39;t allowed to be a consumer?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey cannot fail to learn that some things are not as<br/>\nthey seem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;d add to that thorough<br/>\n&gt; researching of the <br/>\n&gt; product and others like it and how those $300+ would<br/>\n&gt; compare to other <br/>\n&gt; things the kids may covet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thorough researching of everything they ask for would<br/>\nget boring and tedious, and turn into &quot;school&quot; every<br/>\ntime they ask for a board game or a baseball bat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand researching something like your son&#39;s new<br/>\nskateboard, to get one that he likes and will serve<br/>\nhim the best, or which wheels will give the best ride,<br/>\nor whether graphite or WD40 is the best lubricant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand having him save his allowance for it, if<br/>\nyou can&#39;t afford it.

Some babies stop crying, and<br/>\nthe parent thinks, &quot;see, they didn&#39;t really want to be<br/>\npicked up&quot;, but in reality the child learned that<br/>\ntheir needs weren&#39;t going to be met, so they gave up. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want my kids to lose interest in something<br/>\nbecause I wasn&#39;t willing to meet that interest.

The tapes went too fast for my child.  It<br/>\nwas a waste of our money, and left my child in tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also tried:  The Phonics Game (also $300, fun at<br/>\nfirst, but repetitious and boring by Game 3), Primary<br/>\nPhonics, McGuffey Readers, 100EZ Lessons (went through<br/>\nit 3 times, so it turned into 300EZ Lessons and still<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work), Reading Reflex, graded readers, reading<br/>\ncomprehension books, and many others.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worked:  Doing nothing.  Supplying books about<br/>\nsubjects Andrew was interested in, and backing<br/>\ncompletely off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe read at age 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n--Susan in VA<br/>\nWifetoVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.
