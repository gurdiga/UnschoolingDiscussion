Many of already believe it&#39;s hard to maintain a little island <br/>\nof control once the controlling starts to relax and the trust and respect <br/>\ncome streaming in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if one family is spanking, it doesn&#39;t matter to me because for one thing, <br/>\nI know millions of families are.   And for a more important thing, every <br/>\nsingle time this discussion comes around, another family stops spanking.  It <br/>\nisn&#39;t always the family engaged in the debate.  Sometimes it&#39;s just a lurking <br/>\nreader, or something is written which a non-spanking lurker prints out and <br/>\npasses to a sister or neighbor or friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t need to beat up a spanker to show that hitting is bad.<br/>\nThat&#39;s back to the original dilemma.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64329,"nextTopicId":64339}}
