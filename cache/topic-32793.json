Mine&#39;s name is Jenni, small world.  Her idea of <br/>\na good day, is one when she can sit in the tree swing and read for <br/>\nseveral hours at a stretch.<br/>\nHere&#39;s my thoughts on your situation:  Pick your battles carefully.  <br/>\nYou are not ever going to be able to change her taste in music.  Aske <br/>\nthat she not make you listen to the ones you absolutely hate, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t try to tell her what to like.  The same goes for books.  What <br/>\nkinds of books do you object to anyway?  My Jenni just read the <br/>\nLKHamilton seriea.  I was a bit taken aback by the fact that she <br/>\nassimmilated it all just fine, because I thought the last two were a <br/>\nlittle intense.  But she&#39;s fine with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the helping around the house thing, my opinion is that they <br/>\nlive here too, they have to help with general household stuff.  If <br/>\nthey don&#39;t, they are much less likely to get me to do something they <br/>\nwant.  It&#39;s actually been a pretty natual process.  The only time <br/>\nwe&#39;ve done anything that looks structured about the housework was when <br/>\nwe created our joblist.   That was more for the benefit of my dh who <br/>\ncould not and can not leave certain jobs alone.  And it has the added <br/>\nbenefit of everyone being able to look and see what still needs done.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the hormones, talk it out with her when she is calm.  Work up a <br/>\nsystem to deal with the not calm times.  In Rachel&#39;s case, it was just <br/>\n a matter of telling her to stay away from everyone on certain days - <br/>\neither be outside or in her room.  It&#39;s not mandated or anything, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s what works for us all.  She&#39;s happier, we&#39;re happier.  Jenni <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t yet have the vast mood swings Rachel does so hopefully it <br/>\nwon&#39;t become an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, I think what you may need to hear right now, is that if you <br/>\njust let go of school and what you think she should be learning, <br/>\nshe&#39;ll be fine.  In fact, I bet there is nothing picked up in High <br/>\nSchool that is necessary to life that can&#39;t be caught up with later.  <br/>\nI believe that even moreso now that I&#39;m watching my senior exchange <br/>\nstudent with his schoolwork!  It&#39;s GARBAGE.  So don&#39;t worry.  Work on <br/>\nbeing happy and on her happiness.

You&#39;re only there to help, and you&#39;re glad to help as much <br/>\nas she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 14 year old son who is still totally uninterested in academics.  I <br/>\nspent a lot of time over the years trying to find ways to get him <br/>\ninterested in academics, including a couple of periods where I gave up on <br/>\nunschooling and forced him to do various kinds and amounts of schoolwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really been since I came onto this list that I&#39;ve been able to relax <br/>\nand really *look* at him.  He&#39;s a very physical kid, always has been.  He <br/>\nlikes to build things and do things.  He learns by watching to some degree, <br/>\nbut mostly by doing.  And I finally realized that He&#39;s doing exactly what <br/>\nhe needs to be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s always been into sports, and good at them.  It&#39;s great for his <br/>\nself-esteem, especially since he knows how far &quot;behind&quot; his peers he is <br/>\nacademically.  (He reads now, but not very well.)  This year he got into <br/>\nmountain biking and is out almost every day either riding or building <br/>\ntrails and jumps.  He has learned a lot about fixing his own bike, and his <br/>\nfriends even bring their bikes over for him to fix.  He&#39;s a valued member <br/>\nof that little biking group, and that&#39;s also great for his self-esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been working with his dad off and on for a year or two now.  He has <br/>\ngreat work habits and attitudes, in many cases better than the adults on <br/>\nthe crew.  He likes making money, but more important, he knows he&#39;s doing <br/>\nsomething useful and valued in the adult world.  (In fact my biggest <br/>\nproblem right now is helping him find that feeling when he *isn&#39;t* <br/>\nworking.  He isn&#39;t as easy to be around him then.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this to say that it was when I relaxed about the academics and looked <br/>\nat the totality of who he is, I was able to relax and know he was going to <br/>\nbe all right.  Right now I can see him maybe owning a bike store some day, <br/>\nor running eco-tours, or any one of a number of things that aren&#39;t going to <br/>\nrequire much in the way of academics.  I also know how smart he is, and am <br/>\nopen to the possibility that he might want to do something requiring <br/>\nacademics.  I have no doubts that he could &quot;catch up&quot; and go on to <br/>\nuniversity at some point, if he found something he wanted to do that <br/>\nrequired it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my suggestion is to have a really good look at your daughter.  Pay <br/>\nattention to what she likes and especially how she learns.  Try to find <br/>\nways to feed that without her feeling like she has to take your <br/>\nsuggestions.  Let her know that you&#39;re there for her when she needs you, <br/>\nbut that it&#39;s her education and her life.  She&#39;s the one who&#39;ll have to <br/>\nlive it, so she might as well be the one who designs it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5493754,"authorName":"lite2yu@aol.com","from":"lite2yu@...","profile":"lite2yu2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I&#39;m new to unschooling...","postDate":"1016587615","msgId":32801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzLjI0MzUwOWFhLjI5YzkzZjVmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32793,"nextInTopic":32815,"prevInTime":32800,"nextInTime":32802,"topicId":32793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/19/02 8:17:55 PM Eastern Standard Time, calicoeyes@charter.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1479552324\">In a message dated 3/19/02 8:17:55 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:calicoeyes@...\">calicoeyes@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I am especially anxious to hear from &quot;unschoolers&quot; of older students, i.e. <br/>\nteens.

If she is <br/>\ninterested in something (for example, animals) I would ask her if she is <br/>\ninterested in working or volunteering at a shelter or vet, or something along <br/>\nthose  lines. If she isn&#39;t, let it be. I would watch movies with her as much <br/>\nas possible if she is interested. I&#39;m sure others will have some more ideas, <br/>\nbut these are a few that came to mind immediately. Unschooling is individual <br/>\nled learning, so curriculumns, unless she is interested in it would be out. <br/>\nAlso, if she decides not to do the curriculmn, that is fine too. Unschooling <br/>\nis letting go of control and allowing life to unfold in all its beauty. My <br/>\ndaughter is 13, and has always been unschooled, so my experiences may not <br/>\nhelp you much, but I will say we have the best time together and enjoy each <br/>\nother so much, even when we annoy each other!!

Hi, my name is jeni and I have homeschooled off and on for years.  My oldest son did wonderfully with the traditional methods and is now working and in college.  Son #2 is more into the vocational ed direction, though we are muddling through his senior year.  My 15 yo daughter is my main concern and why I am checking out the unschooling approach.  While she was in Christian school, we both would hear, &quot;We know you are capible of the work, so we are passing you to the next grade.&quot;  She enjoyed the social and the outlets with music and drama especially, but hated school.  We finally found a school that seemed to be working, they&#39;re major focus was the fine arts, but unfortunately, it closed after her one year there.  We then began homeschooling, trying every curriculum I could find...BJPress, A Beka, last year I tried tailoring her curriculum using Debbie Bell&#39;s book and The Big Book of Home Learning for my selections.  She hated it.  Her best friend, another homeschooler, had started using Switched on Schoolhouse and Anna had seen her use it and like what she saw.  I ordered it for this year, tailoring it to match her abilities as opposed to age/grade, and she hates that.  Anything to do with any kind of education she hates.  I know she is not dyslexic as her older brother is, but she says she can&#39;t retain anything.  Frankly, it seems to me that she just really doesn&#39;t want to retain anything.  She just hates any form of school work.  So, I am now exploring the &quot;unschooling&quot; approach.  I frankly know very little about it and look forward to learning from your experiences and getting insights into what works and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest concern is the fact that she is 15, almost 16, and would be in the 9th grade right now, according to &quot;traditional&quot; education.  I can see how the natural curiosity of younger children brings about learning, but frankly, Anna is like a slug.  She only wants to read novels, some of which I would prefer her not reading, watch t.v., not of the remotely educational variety, or listen to music, and I&#39;m not talking necessarily Mozart or even John Williams, I am talking rock (which brings up a whole &#39;nuther battle).
