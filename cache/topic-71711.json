I think I&#39;ve figured out what is going on with them lately.  A neighbor girl has been coming over a lot for long periods of time for several weeks.  For example, today she came around 9:30 and said she had to be home at 1:30.  Other days she has done this and then come back again for several hours in the afternoon.  They mostly get along with her, but by the time she leaves they are DONE with social interaction and have less patience with each other.  We&#39;ve all agreed that she can come in the morning, but they want me to tell her not to come back in the afternoon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also gone on two camping trips in the last few weeks, so that also messed up our normal routines and activities, plus they were playing with their cousins all day, every day during this last trip and that is overwhelming as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo top it all off, their dad is a wild land firefighter and he has been gone for 2 months, so of course they miss him and that is added stress.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do make a point to stay present with them and was in the same room making them food when the situation in the OP happened, however with all of this other stuff going on, it was good to get the reminder to do even more to be present and involved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: one week, 8 cousins, different ages, not knowing each other, speaking different languages.","postDate":"1373724072","msgId":71720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtycm1qOCszNGZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMTMwNzExMTU0ODQ2LjExMzYzNThvYm1vNWY0NWFAd3d3LndhbnQuY29tLnB0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":71719,"nextInTopic":71721,"prevInTime":71719,"nextInTime":71721,"topicId":71711,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Can you write or email the families and say you&#39;re trying to put together some kid-friendly activities and want suggestions? I wouldn&#39;t expect the older kids to necessarily be interested in painting - especially boys. They&#39;re &quot;too old for that (it&#39;s girly)&quot; in the world of school - the &quot;too old for that (it&#39;s girly)&quot; phenomenon is going to be the biggest challenge to work around with boys so it&#39;s important to get some information about what they actually enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nMinecraft is popular across a wide range of kids in the US, so maybe something Minecraft related would interest several kids, even older kids. And the superhero movie of the summer is about Superman, if you&#39;re sure superheros are an interest ... but for true superhero buffs it&#39;s important to know if they prefer DC superheros or Marvel - here&#39;s a handy reference guide:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ign.com/face-off/marvel-vs-dc/heroes\">http://www.ign.com/face-off/marvel-vs-dc/heroes</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor little girls, My Little Pony is a perennial favorite (and there&#39;s a new category of &quot;bronies&quot; - boys who love the series, too). For young kids in general, Pokemon is a perennial favorite and for slightly older kids (girls and boys) Inuyasha (demons! rending and slaying! but with a girl main character). Pirates tend to be popular with boys, even slightly older boys, so pirate-themed fun could be good and you could combine it with other things. Talking animals tend to be popular with girls - and the Redwall books involve talking animals as knights and pirates and the like, so it could be a good crossover series.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] one week, 8 cousins, different ages, not knowing each other, speaking different languages.","postDate":"1373552688","msgId":71719,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCMDc3NjQ1LTM0MUItNDEzQi1CRTcwLUNDMDA5NTI5QTQwOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMTMwNzExMTU0ODQ2LjExMzYzNThvYm1vNWY0NWFAd3d3LndhbnQuY29tLnB0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGtyazVnMStqdTY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjAxMzA3MTExNTQ4NDYuMTEzNjM1OG9ibW81ZjQ1YUB3d3cud2FudC5jb20ucHQ+"},"prevInTopic":71718,"nextInTopic":71720,"prevInTime":71718,"nextInTime":71720,"topicId":71711,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I would like this to work - with the 8 of them - because it is ver important to my husband and i fell happy to know that my son knows and likes is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-646614825\">-=-I would like this to work - with the 8 of them - because it is ver <br/>\nimportant to my husband and i fell happy to know that my son knows and <br/>\nlikes is family.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYour reaction to yelling and spanking will be different from your son&#39;s.

Inattentive parents believe their kids are working things out if the kids are quieter.

It could be that one child is wanting the attention of the other and is creating conflict as a way of getting attention. It could be one child is more introverted and is fighting as a way to get away from her sister - get her mad and she&#39;ll leave me alone. It could be one of them is bored - nothing like antagonizing a sibling to relieve a little boredom... but frequently boredom is a function of something like loneliness, so more attention helps.

If the second or third, get more of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a baby has a dangerous object, the easiest way to get it away from him is to hold out something more attractive and wiggle it, jingle it, and he will drop what he has and grab the new thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it works with older kids as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have other hair bands, bring them and set them down and say &quot;look.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if there&#39;s a fight going on, you could say &quot;DROP IT.&quot;  and when the thing is dropped, proceed here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting\">http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEverything else you wrote would be handled by that process.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":323618834,"authorName":"Farhana Khimani","from":"Farhana Khimani &lt;fkhimani@...&gt;","profile":"fkhimani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Kids fighting over things","postDate":"1373484609","msgId":71712,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzM0ODQ2MDkuMjgxMTguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNjEwNi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtyazVnMStqdTY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtyazVnMStqdTY3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71711,"nextInTopic":71713,"prevInTime":71711,"nextInTime":71713,"topicId":71711,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Emily Fortunately or unfortunately, these kinds of fights are ignored by parents which certainly give chance to kids to either enhance their decision","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-676894781\">Dear Emily<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately<br/>\nor unfortunately, these kinds of fights are ignored by parents which certainly<br/>\ngive chance to kids to either enhance their decision making or fighting skills. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere I<br/>\nwould suggest you that we should encourage kids to &quot;Share&quot; things by<br/>\nsaying ... yes this band belongs to us and we should share it now it’s your<br/>\nturn to decide who needs this first until you come up with the answer with<br/>\nlogical reason this doesn’t belong to any of you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly,<br/>\nwe can ask the elder one to quit, this will help her to increase her tolerance<br/>\nlevel and letting things go and owning that she makes her younger one happy but<br/>\nyes it will increase the courage of younger one to always fight and get the<br/>\nthing younger one wants. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this<br/>\nhelps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKind<br/>\nRegards, <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFarhana <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: emstrength3 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:emstrength@...\">emstrength@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 10 July 2013 10:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Kids fighting over things<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nThis morning my 7 year old and 5 year old were fighting over a hair band and saying, &quot;I had it first!&quot;  I tried to figure out who really had it first, but wasn&#39;t sure.
