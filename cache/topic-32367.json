Give it lots of time though.  AND my <br/>\nbiggest thing has always been the happiness test.  If my son, or one <br/>\nof my daughters is unhappy, I look at things more seriously.  If they <br/>\nare cruising along contentedly, I try to leave things be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;vivrh&quot; &lt;vivrh@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Well I feel as though he will need more school like activities <br/>\nsomeday because he is not someone who can read something and <br/>\ncomprehend it or be able to write it in his own words. I think he may <br/>\nhave a slight learning disability. Some kind of problem integrating <br/>\nwhat he is seeing and putting it into words. Now what he may or may <br/>\nnot have is irrelevant and that is why we are learning at home. I did <br/>\nNOT want him labeled. Again that is why we brought him home after <br/>\nbeing in PS for Kindergarten and First grade. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!
