Older kids may enjoy going through the various technical books <br/>\nincluding the For Dummies book (ISBN 0764507672), Creative Projects with <br/>\nLego Mindstorms (ISBN 0201708957) or the O&#39;Reilly Unofficial Mindstorm <br/>\nmanual (ISBN 1565926927).<br/>\n<br/>\n         Mindstorms allow you to build all sorts of robots and program them <br/>\ndirectly or using your computer (depending on the set and the complexity of <br/>\nthe program). The key to them is a CPU Brick that can be connected to all <br/>\nsorts of sensors and motors. There is a very simple language for <br/>\nprogramming Mindstorms, but when you get bored of that or reach the limits <br/>\nof that language, you can use various freeware and shareware products to <br/>\ndevelop new programs using C and other common programming languages.<br/>\n<br/>\n- elizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What we need are more people who specialize in the impossible.&quot;<br/>\n                                      -- Theodore Roethke, poet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Saga","from":"&quot;Saga&quot; &lt;mom@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"GWCK8Wu6i74CoEpnGD5T_yEHMand3-2UlMP44DGmfbvNw18kTH-tLeE0uVeOoIqHogJb-9OSYQg0YrXm9kSR3R5vWA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Legos and beyond","postDate":"997768681","msgId":23293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5GQkJLR0dKQUxPTEFDREhITEhEQ0VET0NGQUEubW9tQHBhZ2FucGFyZW50LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDBHSTEwMEdHS0tIWDA4QG10YTUuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":23292,"nextInTopic":23296,"prevInTime":23292,"nextInTime":23294,"topicId":23280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Some homeschooling moms around here are doing some sort of Lego robot thing, not sure what that is about, but you might be able to find some information about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-90097469\">Some homeschooling moms around here are doing some sort of Lego robot thing,<br/>\nnot sure what that is about, but you might be able to find some information<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\nI believe it was a camp they had to go to , and there were some<br/>\ncompetitions... my DH is totally into it, but I don&#39;t have him here to tell<br/>\nme what it is :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a large 55 gallon garbage can full of my husband&#39;s old legos, he<br/>\nalways talks me into buying more for our son (who is 2) and DH will just<br/>\n&quot;keep them safe&quot; until our son is old enough to play with them :)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Kristi<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Pam Hartley [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 13, 2001 9:59 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Legos and beyond<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1364<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, Aug 13, 2001, 7:11 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt; My sons (6 & 8) build some incredible things with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; legos.
