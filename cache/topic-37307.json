I have seen every<br/>\nbloody &quot;spaghetti-western&quot; ever made I think.  I read raunchy &quot;romance&quot;<br/>\nnovels by 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was about 8 my family went to see &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy<br/>\nBean&quot; with Paul Newman.  The prostitutes in the show were kind of dumb and<br/>\nsilly so when the characters used the word &quot;whore&quot; to describe them, I<br/>\nfigured the word meant stupid.  At the end of the movie we were kind of<br/>\nwatching the credits roll by as the theater emptied.  I hollered out in my<br/>\nbest 8yo way &quot;Look Mama, it says whore up there!!!&quot;  Took me the longest to<br/>\nfigure out why my mom was embarrassed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37285,"nextTopicId":37308}}
