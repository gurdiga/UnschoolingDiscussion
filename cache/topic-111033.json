They also love to buy presents.  When they are choosing gifts to take to a friends&#39; birthday party they really try to think of something very special.  I no longer think that lots of presents teaches a lack of appreciation; I believe it models the joy of giving.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sanguinegirl83@...\">Sanguinegirl83@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n  Oooh!
