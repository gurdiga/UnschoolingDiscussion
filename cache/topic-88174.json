We were going on about it as the kids were finishing up. Sam wanted to go watch his Rescue Heroes DVD, but the girls wanted to stay and listen to what we were talking about. I asked Emily (6) what she thought America and freedom meant, and she had some really interesting points to make about why the pilgrims came and what the Revolution was about. It was a really great exchange, and the girls were interested in listening and participating. It lead us into questions of justice and nationality. We were all just enjoying talking about things and trading our ideas.

It has no redeeming value whatsoever.&quot; That would imply a kind of thoughtlessness that doesn&#39;t belong in unschooling OR in a valuable intellectual exchange. As an unschooler, however, I would not &quot;bite my tongue&quot; when watching something with my children. Part of living and learning, as I see it, absolutely includes the exchange of ideas, even if those ideas aren&#39;t always entirely positive or glowing. I think that my opinion matters and is valuable, just as theirs does and is. I see myself learning alongside my kids, which does not mean keeping my ideas and opinions to myself, but rather owning them AS MINE while respecting and encouraging my children to develop their own ideas and opinions as well without denigration or dismissal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the key is to have a true exchange rather than spouting a lecture or initiating a power struggle. A positive exchange would ask for and respect another person&#39;s opinion. It would involve a genuine desire both to understand where the other person was coming from and to share your own thoughts. Dh and I debate and disagree about issues, shows, politics, whatever; that&#39;s part of what we enjoy about each other&#39;s company. But, we always do so with a mutual respect--the same respect that we show our children. I can&#39;t imagine NOT discussing something that we just spent time watching, reading or playing together. To me, that&#39;s part of the joy of watching, reading or playing as a group, rather than engaging in the same activity as an individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of learning and being interested in something involves discussing it with other people who are interested as well and have their own opinions. I honestly can&#39;t imagine watching something with my kids and not talking about it with them, whether it was a Disney film or a Presidential press conference. Sometimes we discuss things in terms of aesthetics, like &quot;weren&#39;t those costumes beautiful?&quot; or &quot;those images were amazing!&quot; Sometimes in terms of appreciation, like &quot;I can&#39;t imagine all the work that went into making this!&quot; or &quot;I wonder how long it took just to put on the makeup.&quot; Sometimes in terms of judgement: &quot;I didn&#39;t like the way he looked at the world because...&quot; or &quot;he had absolutely no grounds for the arguments he was making.&quot; Sometimes in terms of personal application, like &quot;If I were in that situation, I wonder what I would do?&quot; or &quot;that really made me rethink the way I thought about x.&quot; Sometimes in terms of emotion: &quot;I was so sad when x happened&quot; or &quot;I was so mad when so and so did x.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my $.02<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88403,"nextTopicId":88446}}
