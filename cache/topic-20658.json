Find something more fun for the<br/>\ntoddler to do.<br/>\nPick a quiet, slow street, a cul-de-sac, maybe, and explore the street<br/>\ntogether.  Talk a lot about road safety.<br/>\nBuy a book about road safety that toddler might like.<br/>\nTake an object out into the middle of the road, and hold toddler while<br/>\nsomeone else drives over the object.  Show toddler what happens to an<br/>\nobject when it is smashed by a moving car.<br/>\nTake toddler to the amusement park where he or she can ride in a pretend<br/>\ncar.<br/>\nBuy some play cars and pretend people, set up a road, and act out road<br/>\nscenarios.<br/>\nUse a lot of genuine praise.<br/>\nMake a promise to yourself to be honest about road safety (i.e. don&#39;t<br/>\ntell toddler the road is too dangerous when there hasn&#39;t been a car in<br/>\nan hour).  Use that quiet time to experiment with various ways to cross<br/>\nthe street.<br/>\nWhen toddler is near a road, give your full attention to the toddler so<br/>\ntoddler is never in danger.<br/>\nJust to get you started...<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Anderson-Thimmes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Eileen M.&quot; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the case I gave, with a toddler who is pre-verbal,<br/>\n&gt; what is your solution for it when he insists on<br/>\n&gt; running out in front of moving cars?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20644,"nextTopicId":20660}}
