Yes, I intended to use the word anathema. <br/>\n&gt; Corporal meaning<br/>\n&gt; having to do with the body. Did I say spanking? Or physical restraint? <br/>\n&gt; But, oh,<br/>\n&gt; yes, I do believe in spanking. Yes, judiciously applied-but that will <br/>\n&gt; also be<br/>\n&gt; refuted here since none among you (except perhaps those already under<br/>\n&gt; moderation) can consider judicious application of physical <br/>\n&gt; corrections. I also<br/>\n&gt; believe in capital punishment and hope Lacy Peterson&#39;s husband makes <br/>\n&gt; the lights go<br/>\n&gt; out in California.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are several who consider judicious application to be &#39;creepy&#39; <br/>\n&gt; was that<br/>\n&gt; the phrase used? But, conversely then, they must think that hitting is <br/>\n&gt; okay<br/>\n&gt; when enraged because....why again? (said in one post). Raging and loss of<br/>\n&gt; control is acceptable because it wasn&#39;t premeditated (the animal <br/>\n&gt; equivalent to<br/>\n&gt; uncontrolled anger in humans). Really?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would rather apply a thought out punishment for unacceptable <br/>\n&gt; behavior than<br/>\n&gt; be given to flights of animal rage (yes, rage is an animal emotion <br/>\n&gt; which is<br/>\n&gt; usually called uncontrolled anger by humans). Yes, it has worked quite <br/>\n&gt; well for<br/>\n&gt; me. Its called knowing what punishment is to be applied for a given <br/>\n&gt; action in<br/>\n&gt; advance and making that application under those circumstances only. <br/>\n&gt; While you<br/>\n&gt; may not find it acceptable. I call it thinking rather than reacting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many of the compelling arguments against what many of you have called<br/>\n&gt; spanking seem well considered, though mixed into discussions <br/>\n&gt; containing veiled<br/>\n&gt; personal attacks which makes remaining on topic challenging. My <br/>\n&gt; beliefs are simple.<br/>\n&gt; If a my child disregards rules that have been developed for the <br/>\n&gt; protection and<br/>\n&gt; safety of that child, or where the property of others is concerned, <br/>\n&gt; then that<br/>\n&gt; child is given an escalating form of punishment. Physical punishment is<br/>\n&gt; applied rarely but applied when deemed necessary *to me*. You don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; agree that<br/>\n&gt; there is any case where a child could escalate to a point where a <br/>\n&gt; physical<br/>\n&gt; reprimand is in order and I don&#39;t agree. You (meaning those on the <br/>\n&gt; list vociferously<br/>\n&gt; opposed to &#39;spanking&#39;) don&#39;t see where any behavior on the part of a <br/>\n&gt; child<br/>\n&gt; could warrant a physical reprimand. So, we don&#39;t agree. You believe <br/>\n&gt; that it will<br/>\n&gt; lead to long term injury, psychic damage. We don&#39;t agree.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You (again meaning the listers who have responded) don&#39;t seem to <br/>\n&gt; understand<br/>\n&gt; that as adults we have hopefully already been trained and don&#39;t need <br/>\n&gt; physical<br/>\n&gt; reminders ever-well unless you want to get into the aspects of <br/>\n&gt; socially deviant<br/>\n&gt; behavior (i.e., habitual criminals, etc.), which I doubt. Children IMO <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mini adults. There long term consequential thinking isn&#39;t developed until<br/>\n&gt; there late teens and more typically early twenties. So application of <br/>\n&gt; cause and<br/>\n&gt; effect is far more functional until that time when the frontal lobes <br/>\n&gt; of the<br/>\n&gt; brain &#39;close&#39; making long term consequential thinking concrete. Some <br/>\n&gt; actions<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t open for debate. Period.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been called in obtuse language a variety of rather colorfully<br/>\n&gt; descriptive and rather unpleasant things. Many of these directed <br/>\n&gt; simply because of the<br/>\n&gt; verbiage I choose. How sad that you must make personal, though cloaked,<br/>\n&gt; attacks in order to support your self righteousness. English isn&#39;t as <br/>\n&gt; standardized<br/>\n&gt; as you might think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Animal nature is well defined in humans, just denied. Every time a person<br/>\n&gt; reacts to a situation rather than acts on a situation they are dealing <br/>\n&gt; with their<br/>\n&gt; animal nature. Understanding this goes a long way to aiding many in their<br/>\n&gt; change from reaction to action thinking. Exactly what Shan was talking<br/>\n&gt; about-interrupting her reacting (animal) nature for her acting (human) <br/>\n&gt; nature. I am sad<br/>\n&gt; to know that this aspect of the shadow persona so well discussed by <br/>\n&gt; Carl Jung<br/>\n&gt; and others is so easily discounted here. Unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Karma isn&#39;t an excuse. But, when one wishes to embrace a dogma it <br/>\n&gt; should be<br/>\n&gt; fully embraced and not just the cozy parts. Its rather hypocritical to <br/>\n&gt; say that<br/>\n&gt; only the pleasant aspects of karma should be accepted while the shadow <br/>\n&gt; side<br/>\n&gt; is ignored. Shadow has as many lessons as light to offer. That, I <br/>\n&gt; believe, is<br/>\n&gt; why it is manifest still on the Earth. To infer that a soul isn&#39;t part <br/>\n&gt; of their<br/>\n&gt; own contract incarnate is to play God/dess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hitting has come back time and again into the discussion being only <br/>\n&gt; equated<br/>\n&gt; with abuse and lack of restraint. How sad is that? I think that the <br/>\n&gt; difference<br/>\n&gt; is that we can&#39;t ever agree that there would ever be an appropriate <br/>\n&gt; time to<br/>\n&gt; apply physical punishment. I say grey and you say no there is only the <br/>\n&gt; word<br/>\n&gt; &quot;black&quot; there is not another word in the dictionary that could ever be <br/>\n&gt; tolerated<br/>\n&gt; in this discussion. In other words, to be simple for your <br/>\n&gt; understanding, there<br/>\n&gt; is not a single case where you would find &#39;spanking&#39; appropriate. And <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; agree.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although apparently its fine to ignore your child while in the throws <br/>\n&gt; of a<br/>\n&gt; &#39;tantrum.&#39; Its okay, in other words, to withdraw your emotional <br/>\n&gt; support and<br/>\n&gt; caring to indicate your displeasure of the child&#39;s actions? I think I <br/>\n&gt; understood<br/>\n&gt; that correctly. That was suggested several times as an acceptable <br/>\n&gt; course of<br/>\n&gt; action. Sorry, but, I don&#39;t accept that as anything but child abuse. <br/>\n&gt; Setting up a<br/>\n&gt; child to perform because they can only obtain love, acceptance and <br/>\n&gt; communion<br/>\n&gt; because they act within a certain set of accepted behaviors is far to <br/>\n&gt; passive<br/>\n&gt; aggressive for me. I see it as far more damaging than the abrupt here <br/>\n&gt; and done<br/>\n&gt; of a physical spank. It is insidious.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those of you who equate unschooling with no training I think you have<br/>\n&gt; deluded yourselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good-day<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracey<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Apparently you&#39;re trying to dazzle people with<br/>\na lot of intellectual sounding phrases so that it appears that you know a<br/>\nlot more than the person who is reading so they&#39;d be foolish to question<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not what this list is for.

The purpose of the<br/>\nlist is to help people understand and get to unschooling. And, for those<br/>\nparents who want to extend the unschooling philosophy into parenting, it&#39;s<br/>\nfor discussing that too. Here&#39;s the list description. Maybe you missed it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Unschooling is not a homeschool teaching method. It refers to a philosophy of<br/>\n&gt;&gt; natural learning as well as the lifestyle that results from living according<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to the principles of that philosophy.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The most basic principle of unschooling is that children are born with an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; intrinsic urge to explore -- for a moment or a lifetime -- what intrigues<br/>\n&gt;&gt; them, as they seek to join the adult world in a personally satisfying way.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Because of that urge, an unschooling child is free to choose the what, when,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; where and how of his/her own learning from mud puddles to video games and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; SpongeBob Squarepants to Shakespeare! And an unschooling parent sees his/her<br/>\n&gt;&gt; role, not as a teacher, but as a facilitator and companion in a child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; exploration of the world.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Unschooling is a mindful lifestyle which encompasses, at its core, an<br/>\n&gt;&gt; atmosphere of trust, freedom, joy and deep respect for who the child is. This<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cannot be lived on a part-time basis. Unschooling sometimes seems so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; intuitive that people feel they&#39;ve been doing it all along, not realizing it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; has a name. Unschooling sometimes seems so counterintuitive that people<br/>\n&gt;&gt; struggle to understand it, and it can take years to fully accept its worth.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; The purpose of this list is to move out of our own comfort zones as we<br/>\n&gt;&gt; critically examine our beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about learning, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; seek a deeper understanding of unschooling and more respectful relationships<br/>\n&gt;&gt; with our children.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Please read for at least a week or two, before posting, to get a feel for the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; list.

Yes, I intended to use the word anathema. <br/>\nCorporal meaning <br/>\n&gt; having to do with the body. Did I say spanking? Or physical <br/>\nrestraint? But, oh, <br/>\n&gt; yes, I do believe in spanking. Yes, judiciously applied-but that <br/>\nwill also be <br/>\n&gt; refuted here since none among you (except perhaps those already <br/>\nunder <br/>\n&gt; moderation) can consider judicious application of physical <br/>\ncorrections. I also <br/>\n&gt; believe in capital punishment and hope Lacy Peterson&#39;s husband <br/>\nmakes the lights go <br/>\n&gt; out in California.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are several who consider judicious application to be &#39;creepy&#39; <br/>\nwas that <br/>\n&gt; the phrase used? But, conversely then, they must think that hitting <br/>\nis okay <br/>\n&gt; when enraged because....why again? (said in one post). Raging and <br/>\nloss of <br/>\n&gt; control is acceptable because it wasn&#39;t premeditated (the animal <br/>\nequivalent to <br/>\n&gt; uncontrolled anger in humans). Really?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would rather apply a thought out punishment for unacceptable <br/>\nbehavior than <br/>\n&gt; be given to flights of animal rage (yes, rage is an animal emotion <br/>\nwhich is <br/>\n&gt; usually called uncontrolled anger by humans). Yes, it has worked <br/>\nquite well for <br/>\n&gt; me. Its called knowing what punishment is to be applied for a given <br/>\naction in <br/>\n&gt; advance and making that application under those circumstances only. <br/>\nWhile you <br/>\n&gt; may not find it acceptable. I call it thinking rather than reacting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many of the compelling arguments against what many of you have <br/>\ncalled <br/>\n&gt; spanking seem well considered, though mixed into discussions <br/>\ncontaining veiled <br/>\n&gt; personal attacks which makes remaining on topic challenging. My <br/>\nbeliefs are simple. <br/>\n&gt; If a my child disregards rules that have been developed for the <br/>\nprotection and <br/>\n&gt; safety of that child, or where the property of others is concerned, <br/>\nthen that <br/>\n&gt; child is given an escalating form of punishment. Physical <br/>\npunishment is <br/>\n&gt; applied rarely but applied when deemed necessary *to me*. You don&#39;t <br/>\nagree that <br/>\n&gt; there is any case where a child could escalate to a point where a <br/>\nphysical <br/>\n&gt; reprimand is in order and I don&#39;t agree. You (meaning those on the <br/>\nlist vociferously <br/>\n&gt; opposed to &#39;spanking&#39;) don&#39;t see where any behavior on the part of <br/>\na child <br/>\n&gt; could warrant a physical reprimand. So, we don&#39;t agree. You believe <br/>\nthat it will <br/>\n&gt; lead to long term injury, psychic damage. We don&#39;t agree.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You (again meaning the listers who have responded) don&#39;t seem to <br/>\nunderstand <br/>\n&gt; that as adults we have hopefully already been trained and don&#39;t <br/>\nneed physical <br/>\n&gt; reminders ever-well unless you want to get into the aspects of <br/>\nsocially deviant <br/>\n&gt; behavior (i.e., habitual criminals, etc.), which I doubt. Children <br/>\nIMO aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; mini adults. There long term consequential thinking isn&#39;t developed <br/>\nuntil <br/>\n&gt; there late teens and more typically early twenties. So application <br/>\nof cause and <br/>\n&gt; effect is far more functional until that time when the frontal <br/>\nlobes of the <br/>\n&gt; brain &#39;close&#39; making long term consequential thinking concrete. <br/>\nSome actions <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t open for debate. Period. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been called in obtuse language a variety of rather <br/>\ncolorfully <br/>\n&gt; descriptive and rather unpleasant things. Many of these directed <br/>\nsimply because of the <br/>\n&gt; verbiage I choose. How sad that you must make personal, though <br/>\ncloaked, <br/>\n&gt; attacks in order to support your self righteousness. English isn&#39;t <br/>\nas standardized <br/>\n&gt; as you might think. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Animal nature is well defined in humans, just denied. Every time a <br/>\nperson <br/>\n&gt; reacts to a situation rather than acts on a situation they are <br/>\ndealing with their <br/>\n&gt; animal nature. Understanding this goes a long way to aiding many in <br/>\ntheir <br/>\n&gt; change from reaction to action thinking. Exactly what Shan was <br/>\ntalking <br/>\n&gt; about-interrupting her reacting (animal) nature for her acting <br/>\n(human) nature. I am sad <br/>\n&gt; to know that this aspect of the shadow persona so well discussed by <br/>\nCarl Jung <br/>\n&gt; and others is so easily discounted here. Unschooling. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Karma isn&#39;t an excuse. But, when one wishes to embrace a dogma it <br/>\nshould be <br/>\n&gt; fully embraced and not just the cozy parts. Its rather hypocritical <br/>\nto say that <br/>\n&gt; only the pleasant aspects of karma should be accepted while the <br/>\nshadow side <br/>\n&gt; is ignored. Shadow has as many lessons as light to offer. That, I <br/>\nbelieve, is <br/>\n&gt; why it is manifest still on the Earth. To infer that a soul isn&#39;t <br/>\npart of their <br/>\n&gt; own contract incarnate is to play God/dess. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hitting has come back time and again into the discussion being only <br/>\nequated <br/>\n&gt; with abuse and lack of restraint. How sad is that? I think that the <br/>\ndifference <br/>\n&gt; is that we can&#39;t ever agree that there would ever be an appropriate <br/>\ntime to <br/>\n&gt; apply physical punishment. I say grey and you say no there is only <br/>\nthe word <br/>\n&gt; &quot;black&quot; there is not another word in the dictionary that could ever <br/>\nbe tolerated <br/>\n&gt; in this discussion. In other words, to be simple for your <br/>\nunderstanding, there <br/>\n&gt; is not a single case where you would find &#39;spanking&#39; appropriate. <br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; agree. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although apparently its fine to ignore your child while in the <br/>\nthrows of a <br/>\n&gt; &#39;tantrum.&#39; Its okay, in other words, to withdraw your emotional <br/>\nsupport and <br/>\n&gt; caring to indicate your displeasure of the child&#39;s actions? I think <br/>\nI understood <br/>\n&gt; that correctly. That was suggested several times as an acceptable <br/>\ncourse of <br/>\n&gt; action. Sorry, but, I don&#39;t accept that as anything but child <br/>\nabuse. Setting up a <br/>\n&gt; child to perform because they can only obtain love, acceptance and <br/>\ncommunion <br/>\n&gt; because they act within a certain set of accepted behaviors is far <br/>\nto passive <br/>\n&gt; aggressive for me. I see it as far more damaging than the abrupt <br/>\nhere and done <br/>\n&gt; of a physical spank. It is insidious.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For those of you who equate unschooling with no training I think <br/>\nyou have <br/>\n&gt; deluded yourselves. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good-day<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tracey<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling equals no spanking?

It&#39;s not <br/>\nan overnight, magic, perfect kid kind of thing. But it is product of <br/>\nmany years of mindfully connnecting with our children. My kids act as <br/>\na part of our family.

My beliefs are simple. <br/>\nIf a my child disregards rules that have been developed for the protection and <br/>\nsafety of that child, or where the property of others is concerned, then that <br/>\nchild is given an escalating form of punishment. Physical punishment is <br/>\napplied rarely but applied when deemed necessary *to me*. You don&#39;t agree that <br/>\nthere is any case where a child could escalate to a point where a physical <br/>\nreprimand is in order and I don&#39;t agree. You (meaning those on the list vociferously <br/>\nopposed to &#39;spanking&#39;) don&#39;t see where any behavior on the part of a child <br/>\ncould warrant a physical reprimand. So, we don&#39;t agree. You believe that it will <br/>\nlead to long term injury, psychic damage. We don&#39;t agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou (again meaning the listers who have responded) don&#39;t seem to understand <br/>\nthat as adults we have hopefully already been trained and don&#39;t need physical <br/>\nreminders ever-well unless you want to get into the aspects of socially deviant <br/>\nbehavior (i.e., habitual criminals, etc.), which I doubt. Children IMO aren&#39;t <br/>\nmini adults. There long term consequential thinking isn&#39;t developed until <br/>\nthere late teens and more typically early twenties. So application of cause and <br/>\neffect is far more functional until that time when the frontal lobes of the <br/>\nbrain &#39;close&#39; making long term consequential thinking concrete. Some actions <br/>\naren&#39;t open for debate. Period. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been called in obtuse language a variety of rather colorfully <br/>\ndescriptive and rather unpleasant things.

English isn&#39;t as standardized <br/>\nas you might think. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnimal nature is well defined in humans, just denied. Every time a person <br/>\nreacts to a situation rather than acts on a situation they are dealing with their <br/>\nanimal nature. Understanding this goes a long way to aiding many in their <br/>\nchange from reaction to action thinking. Exactly what Shan was talking <br/>\nabout-interrupting her reacting (animal) nature for her acting (human) nature. I am sad <br/>\nto know that this aspect of the shadow persona so well discussed by Carl Jung <br/>\nand others is so easily discounted here. Unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nKarma isn&#39;t an excuse. But, when one wishes to embrace a dogma it should be <br/>\nfully embraced and not just the cozy parts.

One <br/>\ndistrict, Northampton County in North Carolina, is reintroducing the <br/>\npaddle, though only in the elementary grades. More remarkably, corporal <br/>\npunishment returns to Tecumseh, Oklahoma, after over a decade of <br/>\nnon-use there. The new rules will provide for a maximum of two swats <br/>\nper student per day, and only with parental consent. At the same time <br/>\nCP has been entirely abolished in Galveston, Texas and, after much <br/>\ndebate, in Mobile, Alabama. But Dallas, Texas, having considered <br/>\nabolition, has now decided against it. Instead paddling will stay, but <br/>\nonly on parental request - an opt-in rather than opt-out system. <br/>\nElsewhere in Texas, City View High in Wichita Falls meanwhile prides <br/>\nitself on its pro-spanking policy, with a principal who keeps his <br/>\npaddle on display on his desk. A few parents who disagree with the <br/>\npolicy, which even includes swats for such things as shirts not tucked <br/>\nin, have taken umbrage and moved away. A picture shows the unrepentant <br/>\npaddling principal with some of his obese 10th-grade students. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking through the website I came across the minutes of a school board <br/>\nmeeting in Lee County, Florida in which they were debating (in 2000) a <br/>\nproposal to eliminate corporal punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>National Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7143857,"authorName":"jrossedd@aol.com","from":"jrossedd@...","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling equals no spanking?

I think even schooling is <br/>\nincompatible with spanking, much less UNschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I&#39;m new here, an unschooling mom of nearly 15 years, and a public <br/>\nschool professional for many years before that.  I was a public school policy <br/>\nexpert during the 80s, when schools in the South began to seriously debate whether <br/>\npaddling by school deans and principals should continue. (It hasn&#39;t)<br/>\n<br/>\n       I&#39;ve studied the history and politics of it, heard the claims and <br/>\ndefenses, read the research, made some mistakes, and finally lived my own <br/>\nconclusions. I&#39;ve come to see the same root problem with schooling, corporal <br/>\npunishment, censorship,  political correctness, factory sweatshops, apartheid, and <br/>\nfundamentalism, namely the belief that behavior attitudes and performance must be <br/>\ncompelled. <br/>\n<br/>\n       (How someone can justify any form of compulsion or repression with a <br/>\n&quot;free will&quot; argument is completely beyond me!) <br/>\n<br/>\n     Schools, prisons, represssive regimes, mental treatment institutions, <br/>\nreligious cults -- and to Tracey, yes, even animal experts -- have demonstrated <br/>\nthrough horrible experience that no amount of punishment, however brutal, can <br/>\ncreate love, learning, enlightenment, civility, or abundant life. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Therefore, the &quot;intolerable social behavior&quot; that concerns me is <br/>\nfollowing this failed path by responsible adults, not anything done by anyone&#39;s <br/>\nsmall children.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Spanking adults to correct this unacceptable and harmful social <br/>\nbehavior of theirs is not the answer &lt;eg&gt;. Taking the time to explain kindly and <br/>\nrationally at that &quot;teachable moment&quot; (exhausting as it is) seems to be working <br/>\npretty well, and adult attitudes are improving. This method works even better <br/>\nwith impressionable children btw!
