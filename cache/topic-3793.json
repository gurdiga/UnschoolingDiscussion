When your focus has been on school type<br/>\nmathematics/arithmetic it is hard to see the longer range effects of<br/>\nchildren spending their time doing these activities.  You can see what they<br/>\nare doing when it is a sheet of math equations - but when they play<br/>\nstrategy games I sense a void as to what they are accomplishing.  I suppose<br/>\nit is the several year wait that will show what the profit is to their<br/>\nplaying games of this type.  A new hser may not feel they can wait several<br/>\nyears to see what is happening.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn His Service,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaraine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a> <br/>\nSubscribe to Our Prairie Primer Today Community at:<br/>\n             <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Marbleface@xxx.xxx","from":"Marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"OmN9iF_6_5fOTRB_cpdup7hgPOcGgqzVk5CtrU7jz6ixAXFfKrvw7nrXyoRWZYfP-J7vgrR-LaxG","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Math Question","postDate":"939842319","msgId":3802,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNTMuMzgwMi45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3794,"nextInTopic":3900,"prevInTime":3801,"nextInTime":3803,"topicId":3793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/13/99 3:48:52 PM !!!First Boot!!!, praxis@nextek.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1507863906\">In a message dated 10/13/99 3:48:52 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n I told you all I&#39;d end up being a pain!  :o)<br/>\n <br/>\n OK, Math for Smarty Pants - page 8.
