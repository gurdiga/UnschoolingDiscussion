Have done it several<br/>\ntimes since then.  They are now 15 and 19.  Anyway, I used to prepare a<br/>\ngoodie bag for each one.  You know the neat shopping bag type totes.  Well<br/>\nthey come in several sizes -- will accommodate whatever goodies need to fit<br/>\nwithin! Right now I can&#39;t remember the ages of your kidlets.  BUT here are a<br/>\nfew suggestions for filling the bags: Depending upon age-- markers,<br/>\ncrayolas, coloring pencils, etc.  and lots of cool colored paper of various<br/>\ntypes (colored note pads, stationary, coloring pages) sketch books,<br/>\njournals, fill in the blank silly fun books (mad libs, I think they are<br/>\ncalled that),  OR the neat write and erase boards that RoseArt has out under<br/>\n10 bucks at Walmart and well work it).  Next everybody needs a good book!<br/>\nIf you have babies -- the chewable kind will work or hardboard for the<br/>\nsomewhat older babies.  Baby could probably use a new toy--teddy bear so<br/>\nsomething like that.  They also need travel games.  Another fun thing to<br/>\ninclude is the Rand McNally Kid maps with cool activities and facts about<br/>\nthe areas where they will be traveling through and to!  The biggy is treats!<br/>\nInclude fruit, a special treat (candy bar or favorite granola bar), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure everyone gets a separate bag of their own.  They should be<br/>\ndistinctly *Built* for the recipient.  One way to prevent squabbles about<br/>\nwho gets which bag is to pick out bags based upon favorite colors, hobbies,<br/>\nor cartoon type characters.  You might want to tie a cute curly ribbon on<br/>\neach one and make it seem like a really special present for the trip.  You<br/>\ncan even stress that the presents are a reward because you *just know* that<br/>\neveryone is going to be on their best behavior!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wee Sing and Play tapes and the Are We There Yet tapes can be fun for<br/>\nawhile--if you set a limit on the time that they can be played!

So<br/>\n&gt; just as a btw, one does not have to respect the view of others, it isn&#39;t a<br/>\n&gt; given.
