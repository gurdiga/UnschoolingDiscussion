I<br/>\nfind that I spend more time paying attention because I want to and I have<br/>\nthe time!<br/>\nI think my children are more secure in their being because they know I am<br/>\nalways accessible to them.<br/>\nWe spend much of the day each doing our own thing but together. I do find<br/>\nthat I spend some time analyzing <br/>\nevents in the day to be sure they were of some &quot;educational&quot; benefit ---<br/>\nthem I come back and laugh at the <br/>\nabsurdity of that idea. Experience (LIFE) is &quot;educational&quot;(if you choose<br/>\nthat term).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have decided to start documenting (photos,samples, notes) in a<br/>\nscrapbook of sort. For comfort and memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this was of some help to you.<br/>\nKathy in Tx.
