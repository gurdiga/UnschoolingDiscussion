I&#39;ll have to  <br/>\nlook into that William Blake CD Danielle suggested.<br/>\n <br/>\nFans of Blake and other poets might really get into this CD. It&#39;s by The  <br/>\nDead Poets, a local group of three that puts music to the words of  <br/>\n....well...dead poets. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m a huge fan and am eagerly awaiting their  next CD which will <br/>\ninclude a wonderful song of Poe&#39;s &quot;Eldorado&quot;!<br/>\n <br/>\nDescription of them----a bit from their website is below. Go here for a few  <br/>\ntunes, like &quot;The Tyger&quot;, by Blake.<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thedeadpoets.com/music.html_\">http://www.thedeadpoets.com/music.html_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thedeadpoets.com/music.html)\">http://www.thedeadpoets.com/music.html)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nTHE DEAD POETS&quot; RELEASE LONG-AWAITED CD: <br/>\nAsheville, NC, 21 May 2001 --  Long-dead poets are coming back to life with <br/>\nthe release of a unique debut CD by  inimitable poetry band, The Dead Poets. <br/>\nFor the past six years The Dead Poets  Poetry Band have been wowing audiences at <br/>\nthe Lake Eden Arts Festival and the  Asheville Poetry Show with their <br/>\ncombination of familiar classic poetry and  toe-tapping musical arrangements. This <br/>\nmuch-anticipated recording, entitled &quot;The  Dead Poets,&quot; captures all the <br/>\nharmony, humor, and swing of their live shows with  recognizable poetry set to a <br/>\nrange of music, from bluegrass to rockabilly,  a-capella to country, and <br/>\neverything in between.  <br/>\n&quot;The world NEEDS this CD!&quot; says drummer Allan Wolf, himself a published poet  <br/>\nand former English teacher. &quot;Too many people have the wrong impression that  <br/>\npoetry is like a visit to the dentist; uncomfortable but necessary. We call <br/>\nour  approach to verse &#39;musico-poetica.&#39; That&#39;s when the &#39;muse&#39; in music brings <br/>\nout  the &#39;Oh!&#39; in poetry. Even people who feel that poetry is boring or <br/>\nconfusing end  up dancing to Dickinson and bopping to Blake!&quot; The &quot;musico-poetica&quot; <br/>\nfound on the  new CD should be familiar to anyone who has taken a literature <br/>\nclass in school:  &quot;The Tyger&quot; by William Blake; &quot;Trees&quot; by Joyce Kilmer; <br/>\n&quot;Daffodils&quot; by William  Wordsworth, &quot;Because I Could Not Stop for Death&quot; by Emily <br/>\nDickinson. Even Lewis  Carroll and E.E.Cummings, among others, make an <br/>\nappearance.  <br/>\nIf you missed The Dead Poets&#39; CD Release party, you can still see them live  <br/>\nperiodically.

A favorite verse, a  catchy melody, a bit of <br/>\nharmony--put them together and you might hear something  in the poem you hadn’t <br/>\nheard before. The Dead Poets use music to transform  classic poetry into a <br/>\nfresh and exciting experience, accessible to everyone.  From Cummings to <br/>\nDickinson, Wordsworth to Rumi, you’ll love the way the &quot;muse&quot;  in music brings out the <br/>\n&quot;Oh!&quot; in poetry. <br/>\nBio:<br/>\nThe Dead Poets first performed together in 1996 as the One  Night Dog Band. <br/>\nPoet Allan Wolf (drums) gathered a couple of friends, writer Tom  Tracy <br/>\n(guitar) and artist Alex Alford (bass), for an impromptu gig at legendary  poetry <br/>\nvenue, “the green door on carolina lane” in Asheville, NC. They’ve  continued to <br/>\nplay together ever since, delighting audiences with their unique,  <br/>\nfinger-snapping, musico-poetic stylings.  <br/>\nMore than merely presenting poetry in a novel way, The Dead Poets are  <br/>\ncontinuing a long tradition as old as poetry itself. One of the earliest poems  in <br/>\nEnglish, “Beowulf,” describes scenes of Old English bards (called “scops”),  <br/>\nperforming poems about tribal history to harp accompaniment. In modern times,  <br/>\nmusicians have often mined poetic tradition for their lyrics: Simon &  <br/>\nGarfunkel with “Richard Corey” by Edwin Arlington Robinson (1896-1935); Loreena  <br/>\nMcKennitt with “Lady of Shalott” by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892); and so  <br/>\non. The act of putting poetry to music allows both listener and musician to  <br/>\ntranscend the words and the notes. The Dead Poets call this marriage of song <br/>\nand  verse “musico-poetica.” It’s about learning poetry by note, not by  rote.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100835,"nextTopicId":100813}}
