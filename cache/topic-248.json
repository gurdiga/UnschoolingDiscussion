If he is interested in writing at<br/>\nall, you might try to contact some of the authors of the books that he<br/>\nenjoys and see if any of them will write and encourage him.  If he is<br/>\ninterested in Fantasy and SF board or role playing games you can try to<br/>\nfind some of their creators to write to and tell your son about how they<br/>\ngot started and about their jobs.  There are thousands of people who write<br/>\nthese books and make up these games, and they are just ordinary folks who<br/>\nare interested in the genres, just like your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is more interested in the practical applications and possibilities of<br/>\nSF technologies perhaps a Space Camp would be a great way to introduce him<br/>\nto the real world fact behind the fiction.  One of my sisters works as an<br/>\nEngineer in design and management for NASA.  If he has interest in the real<br/>\nlife space program, perhaps I can ask her to send me some information to<br/>\nforward to you, or get you some names for contact in the space program for<br/>\nmentoring.

You can&#39;t imagine how much your post means to me!  I have <br/>\nhad so much negativity from those around me about my son, that it can be very <br/>\ncatching.  When he was little, he unknowingly to us, had a hearing problem.  <br/>\nFor the first four years of his life, he didn&#39;t talk.  I took him to the <br/>\npediatrician constantly, just to be told that he would talk when he wanted to <br/>\nthat his hearing was fine.  Finally, in desperation, I took him to a <br/>\nspecialist.  We found out that he could hear &quot;sounds&quot; but not enough to <br/>\nunderstand them (that is why the little beep in the ear test that the <br/>\npediatrician did, always showed that he had hearing).  The reason that he <br/>\ncould understand us enough to follow instructions was that he had learned to <br/>\nread our lips!  However he couldn&#39;t hear enough to really mimic speech.  <br/>\n     At four, he took speech therapy.  At five, he started kindergarten (at <br/>\nthe request of his therapist and others who thought that he needed to be <br/>\naround other kids).  That did no good at all, as his speech was &quot;baby talk&quot; <br/>\nat that time and just got him ridiculed by other children.  Besides his <br/>\ncharacteristics (from 4 years of not hearing) were very different and <br/>\nimmature compaired to other children.  We ended up having him repeat grades <br/>\nwhile he was still younger, but he still had a &quot;hellish&quot; experience during <br/>\npublic school.  He even had a teacher ridicule him in front of class (which I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t find out about until later---or I would have done something about <br/>\nit!!!  It still makes me furious to think about it all these years later!), <br/>\nwhich caused him to start becoming angry and acting out at home.  Finally in <br/>\ndesperation in his 6th grade year, I began looking for options (private <br/>\nschool, parocial school etc) and a friend mentioned homeschooling.  I was <br/>\nshocked!  &quot;Do you mean that it is LEGAL?&quot;  I asked.  I only thought that <br/>\npeople who lived in the &quot;Arctic&quot; and couldn&#39;t get to a school did that.<br/>\n     Now I wish I had heard of it way before he began his public school &quot;shop <br/>\nof horrors&quot; experience.  I guess that with public school teachers as parents, <br/>\nI shouldn&#39;t be surprised to not hear of homeschooling, but I am.<br/>\n     Anyway, possibly because of his bad experiences, my son seemed to have <br/>\nno interest in anything.  We tried baseball, soccer, music, choir, you name <br/>\nit-we tried it.  It wasn&#39;t until he started playing nintendo, that we could <br/>\nget him interested in anything, and then we were dissapointed that he was <br/>\n&quot;hooked&quot; onto nintendo, as that wasn&#39;t exactly what we had in mind.  Since <br/>\nthen, he has also gotten hooked onto Science Fiction and Fantasy. Hence the <br/>\nStar Trek, Star Wars, and Robert Jordan books, which his dear mother (me), is <br/>\nalso hooked on.  *grin*<br/>\n     Our relatives, however, can&#39;t get by his very immature and troubled <br/>\nnon-hearing childhood.  They are constantly worrying out loud, about what he <br/>\nis going to do for his future.  They are never around at boy scouts or youth <br/>\ngroup to see how much he has blossomed.  (He has tons of friends and is <br/>\nconsidered a leader in boy scouts.)  Instead, they see the bungling, awkward <br/>\nchild that is now homeschooling, won&#39;t finish a math book and is ruining his <br/>\nlife by unschooling, sleeping to 11:00 am, staying up until 2:00 am. being <br/>\nhooked on Science Fiction and Nintendo.<br/>\n     Unfortunately, the more I hear of their doubt and worry, the more I <br/>\nstart doubting and worrying also.  I am constantly rereading GWS and HEM, <br/>\nJohn Holt books, and Llewellyn books but sometimes that makes it worse <br/>\nbecause those kids seem to be taking off and really &quot;doing&quot; something with <br/>\ntheir lives.<br/>\n     Thank you, thank you, thank you for making me stop and see that maybe <br/>\nthere IS a possibility of getting a career out of the things that he likes to <br/>\ndo. I really did need the encouragement.  I am planning on spending this <br/>\nsummer doing alot of thinking and pondering on my children and their &quot;good <br/>\naspects&quot; and how to encourage them to grow.<br/>\nI am also going to try to &quot;deschool&quot; Myself!  It seems like I need it as much <br/>\nas my kids, since I can&#39;t seem to get the &quot;traditional&quot; school views out of <br/>\nmy head.<br/>\n     If you have any suggestions for me, please send them my way.

Try talking to him about that interest, and maybe<br/>\nintroducing him to some new SF books that may broaden his interests.  Maybe<br/>\na trip to the local bookstore (which my family thinks of more as the<br/>\nbrain-candy store!) is in order, to let him pick out some new material.  My<br/>\nbrother devours SF books at the speed of light, as does my husband.  My<br/>\nhusband took his interest in SF and now works as an Engineer, doing product<br/>\ntesting for Waste disposal and cleanup (he calls it playing with toys for a<br/>\nliving!)
