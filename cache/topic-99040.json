I just learned the hard way as a very, young adult.  I don&#39;t blame my parents for things, I just look for cause and effect so that I can learn from my past and do better for my family now.  I do think that &quot;how you are raised&quot; can effect your life.  If not, we all wouldn&#39;t spend so much time learning from each other and from books, how to be good parents.    My parents did what they thought was right at the time, but they told me themselves that they put very little thought into it and never read anything about parenting.  I want to do better.  <br/>\nMy two cents back.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98986,"nextTopicId":99036}}
