Right as I finished the article, the Columbine news exploded into everyone&#39;s world.  Amazing timing.  Kind of sealed the deal for hschooling for me, (though I did subsequently lend my John Holt book away, lose my nerve and send my son to school for a yr! )   I&#39;ll never forget the contrast between what I was reading and the horror of that day&#39;s news.  I can&#39;t imagine how I ever could have been  sucked away from the inner conviction I came to in the sadness of that day.  I need support to stay conscious I guess.

But I know her first year she asked the kids what they wanted to do and supposedly they told her they wanted to read the Little House books and learn all about pioneer living.  Supposedly, they did hands-on, child-led stuff.  Maybe it has all been exaggerated how child-led.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Unschooling is about walking along beside them as they explore the <br/>\n&gt;world. It&#39;s about being there for them and knowing when to be with them and <br/>\n&gt;when to give them their space.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how much of this she did.  She has so much anger about it all that I can&#39;t figure it out.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And I think it helps if the parent is practicing natural learning herself by<br/>\n&gt;being fascinated by the world and exploring it herself.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, now I will say that she does this.  She is always reading...doing new things.  She is an active person.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There&#39;s so little to go on, but his behavior is saying abandonment to <br/>\n&gt;me.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>His mother and father were into drugs and alcohol at the time.  They had this kid and were living with her.  They left and left her with the kid.  Next thing you know the woman is pregnant again...they move back in...leaves  her child #2........same thing for child #3.<br/>\nShe  made them sign custody over to her because she didn&#39;t trust them to care for them.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow the dad lives 2 doors down the street. He seldom interacts with the kids. He gives them $100 for birthdays and Christmas. He comes in and says hello to them when he is there to ask his mother something.  But the hello is more like a hello reserved for a cousin.  He is remarried. He has a stepson who lives with him and his wife.  The wife is afraid to leave her house, so she is home every day.  She won&#39;t leave to go shopping or to the doctor.  She doesn&#39;t particularly care for the 18 year old because of his foul language, smokes cigarettes constantly, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe mother is remarried.  She lives in a very nice house.  She flits in and out with the two younger ones.  But she doesn&#39;t want to deal with any of the 18 year old&#39;s problems.  She wears a necklace that has three children on it...sends out Christmas cards with her husband and 3 children&#39;s photo...like they are all one family.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNeither parent pays support of any kind.  But my friend has never required anything. I think she is afraid the mother will take the kids back...well, she&#39;d never take the 18 yo.  I doubt if she would really take the younger two either. He husband doesn&#39;t seem like he likes kids. Plus they vacation all the time and kids would cut into that.  They left for Disney yesterday, but didn&#39;t take the kids with them.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe there was like a wall around him (from school? which is a big<br/>\n&gt;abandonment for many kids who desperately want to be home). (And sounds <br/>\n&gt;like there still is a wall around him.) What is there on the other side of <br/>\n&gt;the wall for him? Is it criticism or unconditional love? If it&#39;s criticism,<br/>\n&gt;there isn&#39;t a reason to come out from behind it.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think he has a lot of issues about being abandoned. My friend has had him in therapy for years, but it hasn&#39;t helped...probably because the situation never really changed.  My friend said there was nothing she could do to change the parents at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Has she read Parent/Teen Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach by <br/>\n&gt;Mira Kirshenbaum. I think that book would help her see a lot of what went <br/>\n&gt;wrong.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will recommend it to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There&#39;s still time for him!<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is what I told her.  That he is only 18 and she shouldn&#39;t give up on him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How did she learn about unschooling?  Did she keep in contact with <br/>\n&gt;others while she was doing it?  (Like online, or meetings?  Did she read <br/>\n&gt;Growing Without Schooling, while it was published?)<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  I think she just let him do whatever and said this is what unschooling is.  She said she never saw him do anything other than smoke cigarettes (she buys...the psychiatrist told her that she should), listen to rap, and hang out with other delinquents in the neighborhood.  She claims she didn&#39;t coerce him.  He never developed interests.  Just drawing race cars once in awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Perhaps she only had a flirtation with unschooling, instead of loving <br/>\n&gt;it enough to marry it.   I&#39;m serious.  It&#39;s a commitment.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You raise a good point. I don&#39;t think she was committed to it. I think it was convenient for her to say she was unschooling. It was a way of not having to be responsible for what was going on perhaps? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Back to the &quot;how long was he in school&quot; question.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Up until 6th grade, but he was always in trouble in school. He stole her car at 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;That&#39;s what she said HE did.<br/>\n&gt;What did SHE do?<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>She claims she got them resources when they asked. She claims she didn&#39;t go overboard.  But her 15 yo grandson plays mostly computer games and has the Xbox, Nintendo, Game Cube, and GBA.  She thinks she is doing what is right by letting him to what he wants.  Except now she is on the &quot;You are in 10th grade so you have to do Abeka now because we only have 3 years left of hsing.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nHow old were the other kids?<br/>\nThe other kids finished 3rd and 5th and then came home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How did she feel about the boy&#39;s mother?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She doesn&#39;t particularly like her, but she gets along with her.  She isn&#39;t negative. Lets the kids go with the mother whenever she wants them.  Though the kids don&#39;t always want to go, so the choice is theirs when and for how long. The father never comes and gets them. Never.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Were they siblings?  Was she taking each at birth as they popped out?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>YES!  They also have a half-brother, but the boy has a different mother.  The mother has custody of him, but she drops him off at my friend&#39;s every weekend and school vacation. My friend isn&#39;t happy about it  but says if she didn&#39;t then the kid would be home with his 15 yo sister.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Popped out of whom?  WHY was the mother not keeping them?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mother didn&#39;t want them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How did she mother her own children?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the biggest clue to me.  My friend is the nicest person. But if we talk about her mothering skills, well, I think there are problems. She has 3 children.  Son #1 is the one with all these kids who now live with her.  She claims he had ADHD and that he was no academic in school.  But she says he was respectful, didn&#39;t cuss her out like the 18 yo, never got arrested or anything like that.  He has had drug problems in the past, but I think he is clean now. Seems to be anyway. Doesn&#39;t get into trouble.  Has his own small business. But detached from his kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nSon #2 is married with 3 kids. He has had problems with cocaine addictions in the past. Is supposedly clean now. He has a regular job, sings in the church choir.  He and his wife work and leave their kids with her at least 3 days a week.  She takes them because she doesn&#39;t want them to go to daycare. But it seems obvious to me that they are using her for free babysitting because they have no respect for her schedule, don&#39;t pay her, just drops them off and come back whenever, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nOnly daughter-- was married for a short period of time and came home.  She is remarried and has no children. Doesn&#39;t want children. Has a decent job. Likes the grandkids.<br/>\nShe has a panic disorder like her mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What are the genetics?<br/>\n&gt;Did she raise/bear an irresponsible child who became pregnant by <br/>\n&gt;another irresponsible person who didn&#39;t stick around to raise his own children?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>YES.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There are genetic factors to consider, and psychological factors <br/>\n&gt;(attitude of the grandmother in the whole situation which would create the nest in <br/>\n&gt;which the child grew--was it judgmental? resentful? martyrly?), and nurturing <br/>\n&gt;factors.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>The grandmother will not let any of her children or grandchildren take consequences. She bails them out every time. She has an excuse why this time she has to bail them out.  <br/>\nBut now the 18 yo has such a long rap sheet that the day is coming when she won&#39;t be able to do that. She says she doesn&#39;t care what happens to him but she does. She falls apart every time he is arrested or is in an accident due to drunk driving.  The 18 is the teflon kid. He has never had to serve any time.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wanted her to put him in a drug and alcohol rehab program.  But she said that would be not be very unschooling and too coercive. She said she wasn&#39;t making him do anything he didn&#39;t want to do.  Also, she won&#39;t turn him in for drug or probation violations. She said they have to catch him. She isn&#39;t going to be the one to turn him in because he will blame her the rest of his life.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe 18 yo does blame her for everything. When he rages, which is quite frequently, it is against her.  Her husband is quiet. He doesn&#39;t let the 18 take consequences either, but he always tells me that it is because his wife won&#39;t let him do anything.<br/>\n <br/>\nI worry about the 2 younger children who are always having to live amidst this emotionally charged atmosphere. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation is a mess and seems to keep getting worse each year. I get tired of the drama, but I do like my friend. It is just hard now to have unschooling come between us.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, thanks for listening.<br/>\nDeana<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

What was she modeling about<br/>\nlearning? What cool things were going on in the family that he was<br/>\ninvited to participate in? Was he treated as a functioning member of the<br/>\nfamily, as someone who was competent? Was his input valued?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs he happy with his life now? <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t just letting your kids do whatever they want -  kids<br/>\nlive in a family, a community, and a society, and their decisions have<br/>\nrepurcussions in all of these areas. If my kid choses not to shower and<br/>\nreally smells bad, I may chose not to drive her anywhere because I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike being in an enclosed space with that kind of smell. I won&#39;t drive<br/>\nsomeone who smokes, either, because I don&#39;t like the smell. I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nhow this kid is getting money for cigs, pot, alcohol, and all that, but I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be handing out  money for those things.  If he choses to drink<br/>\n(at 18) o smoke pit, he may be arrested and do time. Those are limits,<br/>\nbut they&#39;re not artificial or manipulative, they&#39;re just honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as what to do now, I think she should discuss her further<br/>\nparticipation (on any level, including financial) with these activities<br/>\nfor her grandson, and point out that if he&#39;s living there as a family<br/>\nmember, he should be acting like one. In return, she needs to start<br/>\nacting like an unschooling parent -  watch some tv shows with him, talk<br/>\nabout race cars he traces, invite him to her activities, invite some<br/>\ninteresting people over... open his world up a bit, without pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":134042206,"authorName":"DW","from":"DW &lt;schorsewoman@...&gt;","profile":"schorsewoman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Delinquent grandson","postDate":"1062212186","msgId":79466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODMwMDI1NjI2LjE0NzM1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNjExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNjIxNzA2NTEuNDI0NC42NzM5OS5tMTBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":79470,"prevInTime":79465,"nextInTime":79467,"topicId":79466,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!
