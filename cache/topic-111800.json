It takes my kids about <br/>\nan hour per day to do school. Some days we don&#39;t do school at all if <br/>\nwe are busy with other things, some days it takes a little longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas wondering if someone could adopt an unschooling lifestyle in <br/>\naddition to continuing to do the carters requirements. It leaves 23 <br/>\nhours in a day for more natural learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nWas also wondering how one would do high school transcripts for <br/>\ncollege admission as an unschooler? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, would like to know if any of you have grown kids that are in <br/>\nsuccessful careers (with or without college.) Do they regret <br/>\nunschooling or are they happy with that choice? Are there any gaps <br/>\nin their education? (I think there are many gaps in mine, a public <br/>\nschool education). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI ordered two John Holt books from my local library, and I should <br/>\nget them in a few weeks (They were checked out) Been reading <br/>\nSandra&#39;s website, and thinking... <br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of think it sounds good, but am hesitant for these higher <br/>\ngrades. They seem to be fine even though we did no schoolwork for a <br/>\nfew years. Not sure what I would report to the state (in PA, <br/>\nportfolios with work samples required), and not sure how I would <br/>\nexplain it to others. Also worried that when they grow up they will <br/>\nhate me for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nErin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111795,"nextTopicId":111804}}
