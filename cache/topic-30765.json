I know every marriage is different, but<br/>\nit&#39;s no good to sacrifice the relationship w/each other for the sake of<br/>\nalways meeting the &quot;needs&quot; of the kids. Parents need<br/>\nto keep that bond strong so that they can be there for the kids in the<br/>\nlong run. I know too many people who have split up under the strains of<br/>\ntaking care of the kids only and not each other. (of course, I also live<br/>\nin NYC which is probably divorce central so my sample population is<br/>\nprobably skewed!).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son slept w/us exclusively until he was almost five. Then he started<br/>\nto snore something awful, and my insomnia got really bad for a few weeks<br/>\non top of it, and I had to think of something that would satisfy my need<br/>\nfor sleep and his need for security. We got him a bunk bed and made a big<br/>\ndeal about how special it was. It became a play area as well as a fun<br/>\nplace to sleep, bc we draped a blanket over it and he started calling it<br/>\nhis &quot;clubhouse.&quot; It was a smooth transition, mostly bc he<br/>\nknew he could always get in bed w/us whenever he wanted to, if he awoke in<br/>\nthe middle of the night. Sometimes, when I tuck him in, he asks me if I<br/>\nwill bring him in later. I always say yes, and then hang out w/my husband<br/>\nfor a couple of hours. Round about midnight, when I&#39;m ready to turn in, I<br/>\ngo get him and we all get into bed together. It&#39;s worked prety well for<br/>\nus, and most nights he&#39;s happy to sleep alone, mostly bc he knows he can<br/>\nalways come in if he wants company. The thing that&#39;s really helped is<br/>\nletting him listen to books on tape or music while he drops off to sleep.<br/>\nHe&#39;s listened to everything from Miles Davis, Micheal Jackson, Barney<br/>\nmusic, Roald Dahl novels, Arthur chapter books, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLynn<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************<br/>\nI threw my cup away<br/>\nwhen I saw a child<br/>\ndrinking from his<br/>\nhands at the trough<br/>\n-- Diogenes<br/>\n***********************</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace","postDate":"1010603702","msgId":30883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTgwMWMxOTk0MSRmMTM4MzA4MCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PGExaHVkYStmNTQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":30882,"nextInTopic":30893,"prevInTime":30882,"nextInTime":30884,"topicId":30765,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I would not give up having my daughter sleep with us for anything, that was not my point at all. It was not even really about just sex. I am just trying to keep balance. I would not want to neglect either relationship. Maybe it is of more issue to me than it used to be because my parents were married 30+ years, and are now in the middle of a divorce. I guess what I was wanting was more just some time to talk, if it were purely a sex thing, we could figure that out. Although you all did have some good ideas!  :oP At the same time, I don&#39;t want Courtney to feel like we are excluding her in any way. I can&#39;t sleep when she isn&#39;t with us in bed. My point was more trying to make some time just to talk and cuddle a little.  <br/>\nAnyways, I tried something new last night!! We all got ready for bed, and then we let Courtney pick out one of her Veggie Tales movies (about a half hour) and put that on for her to watch. My husband and I went to our room and just talked about what happened that day, what we needed to do the next day, ect.  It was also nice just to have a few minutes to catch up and have some quiet time. When her movie was over, she turned off her TV, and packed up her blankie, and teddy bear and came into bed with us. <br/>\nI would have to say that is just what I was looking for! Justin and I both focus so much on Courtney, that is was nice to just talk for a few minutes about us! Thanks for some of your ideas,<br/>\n      Candy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Groundhoggirl <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 09, 2002 10:44 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Wednesday, January 9, 2002, at 12:19 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Natrlmama@...\">Natrlmama@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; In a message dated 1/8/02 7:11:36 PM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n  &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leslie@...\">leslie@...</a><br/>\n  &gt; writes:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &lt;&lt; These years of family living have been the best years of my life and <br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n  &gt; not looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house.

We have always had a family bed. I might<br/>\nalso add that they all breast fed until they were around 5.  My partner and<br/>\nI were together for almost 9 years before we had any kids so sex where ever<br/>\nand when ever wasn&#39;t an issue. Our kids are now 18, 12 and 7. The 18 year<br/>\nold slept in our family bed or his bed with dad or little brother or little<br/>\nbrothers bed etc...until he was 13 or 14. He never sleeps with any of us<br/>\nanymore :~( and we miss him.<br/>\n&gt;   We have a king size with a single on the side for the four of us who are<br/>\nleft. Our 12 year old is with us unless he stays out at a friends or has<br/>\nfriends sleep over. Our baby, who&#39;s 7 already, is still always with us. They<br/>\nall have a bedroom complete with a bed and at times, if someone is sick,<br/>\ncan&#39;t sleep, or wants to have sex, we play musical beds and sleep where ever<br/>\nwe&#39;re most comfy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   My oldest was extremely clingy and never slept out, except for at my<br/>\nmoms, until he was well into his teens. I admit I was worried and had many<br/>\nwell meaning people warning me, when he refused to attend sleep overs or<br/>\neven large parties with friends, and we pushed him at times always with<br/>\nnegative results. Anyway, to make a long story short, he just got back from<br/>\na 2 week road trip to Key Largo with his old girl friend and we spent the<br/>\ntime cleaning and decorating his room to keep our loneliness at bay :~).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m<br/>\nnot looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house. Soon I&#39;ll be looking<br/>\nfor a support group for people who didn&#39;t send their kids to their rooms or<br/>\nto school and can&#39;t live with the peace and quiet. Or maybe we&#39;ll open our<br/>\ndoors to some wayward teens or become foster parents or something.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are<br/>\nyour years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know<br/>\nit!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what.

My husband and I agonize over this<br/>\nvery thing. Our daughter is 4 and an only child.  If she can&#39;t sleep with<br/>\nus, she cries,  and after listening to sobbing for a while, it seems to<br/>\nreally put a damper on the mood. :o) We have tried doing a schedule of one<br/>\nnight in our bed, and one night in her&#39;s, but I have to admit that I am so<br/>\nused to her sleeping with us, that if she does not wind up in our bed, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t sleep, I keep checking on her because it is so unusual!! I know it is<br/>\nimportant not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nneed to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of<br/>\nbetter.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would<br/>\nincrease, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely<br/>\nremodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in<br/>\nchoosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like<br/>\na house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does<br/>\nlove her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of<br/>\nwhat to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it<br/>\njust breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on<br/>\nwhat has worked?

All was done out<br/>\nof necessity as another baby arrived and needed the space closest to Mom&#39;s<br/>\nbreast.  We did &quot;encourage&quot; but still left the decision up to them.  My<br/>\nyoungest was actually *eager* to move into her big sister&#39;s bed and there<br/>\nwas no gradual transition.  She just told us one day she was ready to move<br/>\nto her sister&#39;s bed and that was that.  Anyway--I don&#39;t know that it would<br/>\nhelp with your sex life immediately, but it might make for a smoother<br/>\ntransition if you eased up with the encouragement for her own bed/room and<br/>\ntried another in-your-room arrangement for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie Moyer / Oklahoma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace","postDate":"1010552669","msgId":30838,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNjYwMWMxOThjYiQxZWZmMTBhMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PFBpbmUuR1NPLjQuMTAuMTAyMDEwODE4NTcyMjAuMTA2NTctMTAwMDAwQGtvbmljaGl3YS5jYy5jb2x1bWJpYS5lZHU+"},"prevInTopic":30835,"nextInTopic":30839,"prevInTime":30837,"nextInTime":30839,"topicId":30765,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We have always had a family bed. I might also add that they all breast fed until they were around 5.  My partner and I were together for almost 9 years before we had any kids so sex where ever and when ever wasn&#39;t an issue. Our kids are now 18, 12 and 7. The 18 year old slept in our family bed or his bed with dad or little brother or little brothers bed etc...until he was 13 or 14. He never sleeps with any of us anymore :~( and we miss him. <br/>\n    We have a king size with a single on the side for the four of us who are left. Our 12 year old is with us unless he stays out at a friends or has friends sleep over. Our baby, who&#39;s 7 already, is still always with us. They all have a bedroom complete with a bed and at times, if someone is sick, can&#39;t sleep, or wants to have sex, we play musical beds and sleep where ever we&#39;re most comfy.<br/>\n<br/>\n    My oldest was extremely clingy and never slept out, except for at my moms, until he was well into his teens. I admit I was worried and had many well meaning people warning me, when he refused to attend sleep overs or even large parties with friends, and we pushed him at times always with negative results. Anyway, to make a long story short, he just got back from a 2 week road trip to Key Largo with his old girl friend and we spent the time cleaning and decorating his room to keep our loneliness at bay :~). <br/>\n<br/>\n    These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m not looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house. Soon I&#39;ll be looking for a support group for people who didn&#39;t send their kids to their rooms or to school and can&#39;t live with the peace and quiet. Or maybe we&#39;ll open our doors to some wayward teens or become foster parents or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are your years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know it!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what. Just hope your libido doesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Leslie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n      From: Candy <br/>\n      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n      Sent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 8:58 PM<br/>\n      Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      I am so glad I found this group!!! My husband and I agonize over this very thing. Our daughter is 4 and an only child.  If she can&#39;t sleep with us, she cries,  and after listening to sobbing for a while, it seems to really put a damper on the mood. :o) We have tried doing a schedule of one night in our bed, and one night in her&#39;s, but I have to admit that I am so used to her sleeping with us, that if she does not wind up in our bed, I can&#39;t sleep, I keep checking on her because it is so unusual!! I know it is important not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s need to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of better.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would increase, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely remodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in choosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like a house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does love her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of what to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it just breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on what has worked? I just joined the group yesterday, so I may have missed earlier discussions.<br/>\n                     Candy Oliver<br/>\n        ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n        From: Lorraine Goods <br/>\n        To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n        Sent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 5:13 PM<br/>\n        Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        On Tue, 8 Jan 2002 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KingsDaughterThe@...\">KingsDaughterThe@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n        &gt; I could really relate when you say you just can&#39;t relax.

He never sleeps with any of us anymore :~( and we miss him. <br/>\n  We have a king size with a single on the side for the four of us who are left. Our 12 year old is with us unless he stays out at a friends or has friends sleep over. Our baby, who&#39;s 7 already, is still always with us. They all have a bedroom complete with a bed and at times, if someone is sick, can&#39;t sleep, or wants to have sex, we play musical beds and sleep where ever we&#39;re most comfy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My oldest was extremely clingy and never slept out, except for at my moms, until he was well into his teens. I admit I was worried and had many well meaning people warning me, when he refused to attend sleep overs or even large parties with friends, and we pushed him at times always with negative results. Anyway, to make a long story short, he just got back from a 2 week road trip to Key Largo with his old girl friend and we spent the time cleaning and decorating his room to keep our loneliness at bay :~). <br/>\n<br/>\n  These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m not looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house. Soon I&#39;ll be looking for a support group for people who didn&#39;t send their kids to their rooms or to school and can&#39;t live with the peace and quiet. Or maybe we&#39;ll open our doors to some wayward teens or become foster parents or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are your years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know it!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what. Just hope your libido doesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Leslie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: Candy <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, January 08, 2002 8:58 PM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: [a moment&#39;s peace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am so glad I found this group!!!

I know it is important not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s need to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of better.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would increase, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely remodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in choosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like a house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does love her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of what to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it just breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on what has worked?
