We&#39;ve done projects from Math Art (a scholastic book). She want to do arithmetic--says she doesn&#39;t like being &quot;behind&quot; her friends. She was working with the Key To.. series, got stuck, and realized she never really learned the beginning stuff.  But doesn&#39;t like to do it. so we surround ourselves with mathematical thinking--and try again<br/>\n  I hope this makes sense--I&#39;m real tired!<br/>\n  Debra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Thad Martin <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, January 08, 2000 3:18 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] 11 yr old/[Fwd: mathematical thinking- more than just number crunching]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: Thad Martin &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmartin@...\">tmartin@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  hi, <br/>\n  these sites are not about &#39;arithmetic&#39; but they may open up a whole new world of math as more of a science.  this is a forward.   i had sent it originally right before christmas.  i would love start a discussion on this perspective of math if anyone is interested. <br/>\n<br/>\n  -susan <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n    hi, <br/>\n    this year i&#39;ve been focusing on aquiring a more conceptual understanding of mathematic.  i know math is a perennial topic and has been covered at great length in many many homeschool groups, but i want to understand math beyond the popularly accepted notion of number crunching.   so this email is for anyone interested in math as something like a &#39;science of patterns&#39;, where numbers are just one on the many &#39;mathematical objects&#39; used. <br/>\n<br/>\n    i have a long way to go before i have any real grasp on this, but i thought i should pass on what i&#39;ve found to date. <br/>\n<br/>\n    first there are some very good software programs which i found (among the miriade out there) that break away from the traditional approach to math. <br/>\n    Like science, mathematics is taught more as an array of facts and algorithms to memorize than as a habit of inquiry that includes discussion, argument, and exploration. <br/>\n    programs we have and like are: <br/>\n    by lucas learning - pit droids & yoda&#39;s challenge <br/>\n    by broderbund - logical journey of the zoombini <br/>\n    i&#39;m sure there are more but so far this is what we have found. <br/>\n<br/>\n    in the back of the pit droids &#39;owner&#39;s manual&#39;  there are some very interesting web sites and i think that they are all well worth a look (also free stuff available). <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.terc.edu/\">http://www.terc.edu/</a> <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aimsedu.org/\">http://www.aimsedu.org/</a> <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.uidaho.edu/~casey931/mega-math/\">http://www.cs.uidaho.edu/~casey931/mega-math/</a> <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scottkim.com/\">http://www.scottkim.com/</a>   -puzzle master <br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    Perhaps one of the best-kept secrets about mathematics is that it is easy to get a feel for the kinds of questions that are at the wide-open frontiers of knowledge.
