I was almost ready to give up when the anger<br/>\nstarted and I decided to try the creative approach. Honesty and try caring<br/>\nweren&#39;t working so I just made them well aware that I was documenting<br/>\neverything and then the final straw came when a note was sent home about why<br/>\nmy son&#39;s artwork was ripped up by a teacher because he wanted to finish it<br/>\nand the teacher wanted him to move on to something else -well - I saw red<br/>\n(no art pun intended) and decided to send a reply (documented) in which I<br/>\nsought assurance that my families long tradition of creativity was being<br/>\ngiven respect and that the officials of this academic establishment were not<br/>\ntrying to disparage our heritage. And miraculously, my son&#39;s &quot;behavior&quot;<br/>\nimproved - over-night. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater after a move to another district and the threat of having to go<br/>\nthrough it all again I decided to pull them out. But it does work to<br/>\ndocument and let them know you are. When you take the proactive, offensive<br/>\nrole, they can&#39;t get you on the defensive and eventually, they write you off<br/>\nand deal with it the way it is. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSondra<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sara [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cheeps4u@...\">cheeps4u@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 16, 2004 7:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: The Dreaded Phone Call<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;sondracarr@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&quot;Yes - absolutely.
