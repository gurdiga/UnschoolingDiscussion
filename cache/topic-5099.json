I believe that Homeschooling is one of the<br/>\n<br/>\nbest ways to help kids with multiple allergies and/or sensitivities.  In a<br/>\n<br/>\nvery real and important sense we can control their environment much more<br/>\n<br/>\nthan if they were in IS. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really grateful for homeschooling, too.  My son has asthma and pet <br/>\nallergies, plus pretty mild food allergies.  We&#39;ve had the experience of <br/>\ngoing to the emergency room from 2am to 6, and then having James be mostly <br/>\nwell, but exhausted.  If he was enrolled in school, I have to wonder if the <br/>\nschool would hassle me for keeping him home to school to sleep the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames is shy, having to tell the teacher he needs medicine and then go to the <br/>\nschool nurse to get it, when his breathing flares up, would be difficult for <br/>\nhim, especially in front of all the other kids.  I&#39;m happy to skip that.  <br/>\n(Around here schools are so freaked out about drugs I&#39;ve heard that they <br/>\nwon&#39;t let kids carry their own inhalers.  Yuck!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5090,"nextTopicId":5110}}
