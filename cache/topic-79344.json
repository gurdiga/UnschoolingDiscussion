I never touched that pool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty has a cold, since Sunday night, but no ear infections because ne never <br/>\ngets ear infections.  We talked about how people get what they get, when their <br/>\nsystem is down for whatever reasons and lots of factors make &quot;down,&quot; like <br/>\nlack of sleep, not eating well, not resting.  Me, I get fever blisters and <br/>\nsometimes sore throats, when I&#39;m &quot;down&quot; with other factors.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a lot of not sleeping, not resting, not eating well going on at the <br/>\nconference!  I asked Marty to explain it in gamer terms that some of the kids <br/>\nwould understand and so here it is--pass it on to your gamer kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe D&D theory (detailed by Marty) about lack of sleep and getting sick:<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething can give you a cold.  An enemy.<br/>\nWhen your character has a cold, it can&#39;t heal health points.<br/>\nYou can make a DC check of whatever the cold is (germs) vs. your fortitude.<br/>\nSleeping adds plus five to your roll.<br/>\nNot sleeping adds plus five to the DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedicine adds plus two to your fortitude for like six hours or whatever.  <br/>\n(He used &quot;DayQuill.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pool could be a place like a marsh that carries the disease.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who slept who could make the save roll easier than those who didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe the pool was providing germs, but maybe those who were well-fed and <br/>\nwell-rested wouldn&#39;t have gotten sick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79323,"nextTopicId":79358}}
