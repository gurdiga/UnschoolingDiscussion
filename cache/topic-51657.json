They tend to be very strong on<br/>\nrespect of elders and the whole discipline thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you know, if Sandra&#39;s kids speak politely to her because that&#39;s what<br/>\nthey hear, then it makes sense.   Let&#39;s face it, your commander or NCO<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t usually *ask* you to do things, with please neatly tacked onto the<br/>\nend of the request!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s hard for military families to do differently, because it<br/>\nrequires the military member to exist in 2 totally different worlds.  The<br/>\none with strict order and discipline, and the one at home with respect of<br/>\nall ages, flexability and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m married to a truly great guy who&#39;s totally committed to unschooling and<br/>\nchild-led learning, and he sometimes has a hard time making the switch.
