By this time<br/>\nhe had already been working hands on with electronics for a few years, so<br/>\nhad practical experience. Within 1 semester he dropped out because the<br/>\ncurriculum was memorization of facts instead of teaching the students WHERE<br/>\nto find the info when they need it. He found it to be a huge waste of<br/>\ntime...ended up working for IBM for a number of years and had his own<br/>\ncomputer consulting business&#39; on and off over the years. All self taught. He<br/>\nis also a supporter of homeschooling and now after a visit (he and my mother<br/>\nlive in the Gambia) with face to face discussion of unschooling he is a<br/>\nsupporter of this method as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is that although he was proud of me for getting a Masters in<br/>\nsecondary ed/English I think he always had that attitude re: those who can<br/>\ndo; those who can&#39;t, teach.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is about growth and change...and I love my children enough to let them<br/>\ngrow their own way:)<br/>\nBeth-in GA<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Angela&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling@...\">unschooling@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 27, 2003 7:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Classical/ Calvert and the like<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My fil went to college to be an engineer.
