I printed<br/>\nthem out, and plan on leaving them around so DH will find them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, Gabe (almost 9) has been getting angry a lot, mostly at his<br/>\ndad and his friends. Amy&#39;s post is helping me think more carefully<br/>\nabout why. I had some vague ideas before about what was bothering him<br/>\n(in general, rather than the triggers for each specific meltdown), but<br/>\nI know that I need to be much more focused on what&#39;s going on, so that<br/>\nI can be more proactive, and try to help him avoid these episodes as<br/>\nmuch as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one month, we&#39;ll be moving halfway across the country, so, no<br/>\nsurprise, I think that&#39;s a big contributor to the stress that Gabe&#39;s<br/>\nfeeling. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think the things that set him off are also important. With his<br/>\nfriends, he&#39;s been feeling lately that he is much more generous with<br/>\nthem than they are with him. We live in a complex with lots of kids,<br/>\nso he never really has any down time unless I make him come inside. He<br/>\nalways wants to bring popsicles and other food and drinks outside to<br/>\nshare, but rarely would the other kids do so. (I have a feeling that<br/>\nit is partly because their parents can&#39;t or won&#39;t buy them enough, so<br/>\nthey feel like they have to hoard what they have...) Eventually we<br/>\nsuggested that he not offer things, because the lack of reciprocity<br/>\nwas making him feel bad, and none of our compliments about his<br/>\ngenerosity made him feel any better. <br/>\n<br/>\nanother big factor, and the one I have the hardest time with, is his<br/>\ndad&#39;s attitude about respectful parenting. We&#39;ve (I should say &quot;I&#39;ve&quot;)<br/>\nbeen doing this more thoughtfully for less than a year, and DH&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;paradigm shift&quot; regarding parenting is a bit behind mine. He&#39;s still<br/>\ntoo authoritative too often, and DS is not having it. Gabe is very<br/>\nsure of himself, and he fights back. I do intervene, and I&#39;m getting<br/>\nbetter at doing so in a way that defends DS while not pitting me<br/>\nagainst DH. But Gabe still has the cumulative effect of often having<br/>\nto rebel against ridiculous/arbitrary rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, for DH, I can&#39;t wait for the Live and Learn Conference! And<br/>\nfor DS, I hope that understanding his anger better will help me to<br/>\nintervene and advocate better for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139413400,"authorName":"Quinlon&#39;s Mommy","from":"Quinlon&#39;s Mommy &lt;quinlonsma@...&gt;","profile":"quinlonsma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] understanding anger","postDate":"1122845384","msgId":107638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNzMxMjEyOTQ0Ljc5NzUucW1haWxAd2ViNTIwMDgubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGRjZ25laytmbTNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107637,"nextInTopic":107662,"prevInTime":107637,"nextInTime":107639,"topicId":107481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I was in college I learned, when confronted by someone who was angry, to lower my voice, offer them water, and listen as we walked.

If we feel a physical resistance of any kind, that&#39;s a signal<br/>\nto the body that we need *more* adrenaline, and to fight harder.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(As I think about it, that may explain why Sheila had to hold her<br/>\nhands up for 15 minutes -- a really long time -- to protect herself<br/>\nagainst her son.

Sometimes they&#39;re turned inward or turned towards a bed<br/>\nor a pillow -- sometimes they&#39;re turned outward toward another person.<br/>\n Meltdowns tend to be an out-of-control explosion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also the kind of hitting/meanness that seems more calculated<br/>\n-- &quot;I want this and I&#39;m bigger and so I&#39;ll take it.&quot;  Or &quot;You didn&#39;t<br/>\ngive me what I wanted so I&#39;ll hurt you.&quot;  But even in those<br/>\nsituations, in my experience, there is a bit of an explosion, an<br/>\ninability in the moment to think of what *else* to do, or to see<br/>\nanother solution as more beneficial.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original poster said her son punched her for 15 minutes.  The way<br/>\nI saw the interaction taking place, he was<br/>\nout-of-control/meltdown/raging angry.  I think it&#39;s useful to try to<br/>\nunderstand that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, there are only limited differences between having an angry<br/>\nmeltdown and having an angry meltdown where you try to hurt others. <br/>\nThe big difference is that somebody needs to keep the others safe<br/>\nduring this time, and get the angry person to a place where he/she<br/>\ncan&#39;t hurt others.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut past that, there is still the anger to deal with -- that&#39;s the<br/>\nbiggest part of the problem.  So here are some thoughts about anger.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne definition I&#39;ve heard:  anger actually stems from helplessness --<br/>\nit&#39;s a way to feel powerful when one actually feels very<br/>\nout-of-control and powerless under the surface.  Fear and sadness are<br/>\nalso often a big part of anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to think of it -- anger is a way to make yourself big and<br/>\nscary when there&#39;s a dispute over limited resources.  Not usually a<br/>\ngreat solution for living in civilization, but it works very well in<br/>\nnature, and the fact that it remains with us speaks for its<br/>\nevolutionary usefulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else I&#39;ve heard about anger -- when we are infants,<br/>\nscreaming and crying are the main tools we have to get our needs heard<br/>\nand met.  When things go poorly and our brains shut down, that&#39;s what<br/>\nwe revert to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrenaline is a big part of an anger reaction -- the &quot;fight or flight&quot;<br/>\nreaction is a very difficult one to reason ourselves out of once it<br/>\nhits.  In addition to giving us quick reactions and additional<br/>\nstrength, adrenaline gives us &quot;tunnel vision&quot; -- we are only able to<br/>\nthink about, or even see, one or maybe two variables at a moment (as<br/>\nopposed to when our conscious minds function normally, and we can<br/>\njuggle 5-7 variables in a situation).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope it doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m just philosophizing (in a non-helpful<br/>\nway) about anger.  I have collected these tidbits about anger because<br/>\nit has played a big part in my own life.  It is only in the past few<br/>\nyears that I can consistently count on myself to act the way I want<br/>\nto, even when &quot;driven to anger.&quot;  Knowing these things about anger<br/>\nhave helped my own self-awareness, which led to much more peaceful<br/>\nbehavior on my part. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of my own past, my focus with my children has been to address<br/>\nthe underlying issues of anger, and not to focus as much on their<br/>\nbehavior as &quot;inappropriate&quot; or &quot;unacceptable,&quot; or on them as<br/>\n&quot;abusers.&quot;  Anger is a difficult emotion to feel, and then when others<br/>\nthink that one is a freak or an abuser for feeling a lot of anger, or<br/>\nfor feeling it very intensely -- that makes it that much more difficult.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m still not saying that it&#39;s okay for anyone to be abused, and if<br/>\nsomeone does get hurt, that hurt needs to be dealt with just as much<br/>\nas the other person&#39;s anger.  I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s helpful to<br/>\nput the main focus on the hitting or other abuse, at least in my<br/>\nsituation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think that knowing and understanding something about what anger<br/>\nis can be very helpful for a parent&#39;s relationship with their kids and<br/>\nfor helping a child with their own self-awareness.  It&#39;s normal to get<br/>\nangry when you don&#39;t get your way.  Our brains are set up so that we<br/>\nneed to work a little harder at problem-solving and win/win situations<br/>\n-- these aren&#39;t always our first responses.  We can work past that,<br/>\nbut we can also have have some understanding and tenderness toward our<br/>\nkids&#39; anger (and our own).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that knowing how narrowly focused the brain gets when<br/>\nangry does highlight the need for giving information.  People get very<br/>\nself-absorbed when they&#39;re feeling angry and needy.  As well as<br/>\ndealing with the needs themselves, when the child is in a better frame<br/>\nof mind, the parent can point out things that the child may not have<br/>\nconsidered.  &quot;It&#39;s not fun for me when you&#39;re fighting at the grocery<br/>\nstore.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that information often can&#39;t be heard if the a person is still<br/>\nin angry mode or &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode -- adrenaline doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nenough room in the brain for any more information or talking at that<br/>\npoint.  That information tends to be more helpful before a situation<br/>\narises, with some forethought as to what might arise before it does. <br/>\nIt&#39;s also more helpful afterwards, when the child is calm and has a<br/>\nchance to re-think the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Of course, giving information in a direct, condensed form in the<br/>\nmiddle of an angry situation can sometimes help the person re-focus. <br/>\n&quot;That hurts, so stop.&quot;  &quot;Your voice is hurting my ears.&quot;  &quot;If you<br/>\nthrow that it will break, and you won&#39;t have it anymore.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt my house, we do have a word for that before-and-after talking and<br/>\nthinking -- we call that processing.  Or briefing and de-briefing --<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard it called that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was some talk about the word, &quot;processing,&quot; on the list, too,<br/>\nwith some unpleasant examples/associations of the word -- all true.  I<br/>\ndo have another view.  <br/>\n<br/>\nProcessing is also what a computer does to information, breaking it<br/>\ndown into binary information that it can work with.  We process grain<br/>\nin a mill and then in an oven -- breaking it apart, taking out the<br/>\nhard unhelpful parts, and cooking it with other things so that our<br/>\nbodies can swallow and digest it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDigestion itself is a process, and through it our cells get the fuel<br/>\nand nutrients in a form they can use them -- and our bodies get rid of<br/>\nthe crap we don&#39;t need in the same process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want to process people, but I think processing ideas and<br/>\nemotions and one&#39;s understanding of a situation can be pretty useful.<br/>\n I usually need to do it quite a bit, for my own peace and<br/>\nunderstanding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just would never force anyone else to join me in the process or to<br/>\ngo through it themselves if they weren&#39;t ready.  That causes stress,<br/>\nand as we all know, stress doesn&#39;t aid digestion -- of food or ideas<br/>\n-- well at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"Betsy Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Fighting kids","postDate":"1122439399","msgId":107529,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyRTcxMEU3LjIwMDAxMDFAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRjNjlybCtmazM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRjNjlybCtmazM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107527,"nextInTopic":107530,"prevInTime":107528,"nextInTime":107530,"topicId":107481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**I have a hunch we re talking about different situations.

Would a couple of breaths help?&quot; <br/>\n&gt; And so on.  The rest of my family does this as well.  That&#39;s how we<br/>\n&gt; meet the need of each of us to have feedback and information about how<br/>\n&gt; our words and actions are affecting others.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again, the concepts of &quot;abuser&quot; and &quot;victim&quot; just don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; register on my radar.

I split my time between those in<br/>\n&gt; need.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ==That may mean that the one being mean has to listen or stay put long<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enough to hear from the person who was hurt by the one raging.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; His rage and anger is an imposition. Sometimes hearing the person who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was hurt is an imposition on him.==<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think this is where the parent, who is already present, can help<br/>\n&gt; create a safe space for the child who is melting down, so it&#39;s not an<br/>\n&gt; imposition on others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; == Isn&#39;t the goal to learn how to curb that raging and crying so that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t spill over onto others?==<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My goal is not to &quot;curb&quot; it if that means repression or oppression. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean.  My son&#39;s crying doesn&#39;t hurt anyone else<br/>\n&gt; -- if it&#39;s too loud, we leave or he leaves the room, so he can have a<br/>\n&gt; good cry in peace. If he&#39;s throwing himself around, again, I can keep<br/>\n&gt; everyone safe -- some cushions near him and the rest of us in a safe<br/>\n&gt; place. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My goal is to give tools for self-awareness and social awareness, to<br/>\n&gt; accept the need for crying as part of healing and learning, and to<br/>\n&gt; create a peaceful space overall so that there aren&#39;t unnecessary<br/>\n&gt; meltdowns and bickering and fighting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; == Not all kids are hard on themselves after being mean.==<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, but I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that some -- many -- are,<br/>\n&gt; especially after their side of the story has been heard and understood.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; == Sometimes they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cathart by raging and then think others are being unreasonable for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reacting badly.==<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  Yes, kids need to rage sometimes<br/>\n&gt; (otherwise known as a &quot;tantrum&quot; or a meltdown) to release tension.  As<br/>\n&gt; a parent, I can give them a safe space to do so, where it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; affect others.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s human nature to see only your own side of things when you<br/>\n&gt; are upset (&quot;thinking others are being unreasonable&quot;) and that is<br/>\n&gt; coming out of real pain and feeling misunderstood and not heard.  I<br/>\n&gt; prefer to show some understanding while still giving feedback and<br/>\n&gt; information about the effect on others (and this is where some finesse<br/>\n&gt; comes in, giving information when it can best be heard), rather than<br/>\n&gt; blaming the child for feeling his emotions.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a general rule, I think kids who are respected and have access to<br/>\n&gt; good information about self-awareness and social awareness grow out of<br/>\n&gt; the meltdowns and rages -- brain development and emotional maturity<br/>\n&gt; catch up when they&#39;re ready, much like reading and the other things we<br/>\n&gt; talk about in unschooling do.

Not<br/>\njust as follow-up to an argument -- as part of life.  &quot;That was cool<br/>\nto hear about your Pokemon battle.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m glad you can tell me what&#39;s<br/>\nwrong.&quot;  &quot;Your voice is so loud it&#39;s hurting my ears.&quot;  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nlike it if you were holding my hands when I didn&#39;t want them held.&quot; <br/>\n&quot;I can see you getting frustrated.  Would a couple of breaths help?&quot; <br/>\nAnd so on.  The rest of my family does this as well.  That&#39;s how we<br/>\nmeet the need of each of us to have feedback and information about how<br/>\nour words and actions are affecting others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the concepts of &quot;abuser&quot; and &quot;victim&quot; just don&#39;t really<br/>\nregister on my radar.  It&#39;s more about meeting needs and giving<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\n==I find it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just as important to offer support to the child on the receiving end.==<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, and I certainly wasn&#39;t saying that I was taking sides or giving<br/>\nmore attention to one or the other.  I split my time between those in<br/>\nneed.<br/>\n<br/>\n==That may mean that the one being mean has to listen or stay put long<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; enough to hear from the person who was hurt by the one raging.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; His rage and anger is an imposition. Sometimes hearing the person who<br/>\n&gt; was hurt is an imposition on him.==<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is where the parent, who is already present, can help<br/>\ncreate a safe space for the child who is melting down, so it&#39;s not an<br/>\nimposition on others.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Isn&#39;t the goal to learn how to curb that raging and crying so that it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; doesn&#39;t spill over onto others?==<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My goal is not to &quot;curb&quot; it if that means repression or oppression. <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean.  My son&#39;s crying doesn&#39;t hurt anyone else<br/>\n-- if it&#39;s too loud, we leave or he leaves the room, so he can have a<br/>\ngood cry in peace. If he&#39;s throwing himself around, again, I can keep<br/>\neveryone safe -- some cushions near him and the rest of us in a safe<br/>\nplace. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal is to give tools for self-awareness and social awareness, to<br/>\naccept the need for crying as part of healing and learning, and to<br/>\ncreate a peaceful space overall so that there aren&#39;t unnecessary<br/>\nmeltdowns and bickering and fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n== Not all kids are hard on themselves after being mean.==<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, but I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that some -- many -- are,<br/>\nespecially after their side of the story has been heard and understood.<br/>\n<br/>\n== Sometimes they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cathart by raging and then think others are being unreasonable for<br/>\n&gt; reacting badly.==<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  Yes, kids need to rage sometimes<br/>\n(otherwise known as a &quot;tantrum&quot; or a meltdown) to release tension.  As<br/>\na parent, I can give them a safe space to do so, where it doesn&#39;t<br/>\naffect others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s human nature to see only your own side of things when you<br/>\nare upset (&quot;thinking others are being unreasonable&quot;) and that is<br/>\ncoming out of real pain and feeling misunderstood and not heard.  I<br/>\nprefer to show some understanding while still giving feedback and<br/>\ninformation about the effect on others (and this is where some finesse<br/>\ncomes in, giving information when it can best be heard), rather than<br/>\nblaming the child for feeling his emotions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a general rule, I think kids who are respected and have access to<br/>\ngood information about self-awareness and social awareness grow out of<br/>\nthe meltdowns and rages -- brain development and emotional maturity<br/>\ncatch up when they&#39;re ready, much like reading and the other things we<br/>\ntalk about in unschooling do.  I don&#39;t see it as something that needs<br/>\nto be curbed as much as worked with and worked through.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Fighting kids","postDate":"1122408397","msgId":107524,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFjLjc3ZGE4NzM1LjMwMTdmMWNkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107519,"nextInTopic":107525,"prevInTime":107523,"nextInTime":107525,"topicId":107481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That person can take some time to<br/>\nregroup. Then we address it when the victim is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf both are being cruel, we stop the fighting and then help everyone<br/>\nsay what needs to be said in a kinder, more useful manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if the one being cruel powers-over to get the computer or X Box<br/>\nand then doesn&#39;t want to deal with the hurt he or she caused but wants<br/>\nto go right ahead with the X box or whatever, that isn&#39;t okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe couch is just a piece of furniture. It&#39;s not &quot;formalized,&quot; it&#39;s<br/>\njust handy. We have seven people. Sometimes sitting down helps to<br/>\nlower the tone of the arguing. Standing can add to the sense of one<br/>\nbeing bigger than the other. Sitting equalizes. We sometimes suggest<br/>\nbreathing before talking too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that my oldest (18) almost always takes big deep breaths now<br/>\non his own when he and his sister tangle before he addresses what she<br/>\nsaid that hurt/angered him. I find that interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve noticed is that in many families, kids say mean things to<br/>\neach other and the parents just issue a &quot;don&#39;t you dare say that to<br/>\nyour brother&quot; kind of comment. That does nothing to hold the abusive<br/>\nchild accountable nor does it aid the victim in voicing his or her own<br/>\nanger or perspective. Having to stay with the impact of your beahvior<br/>\nis what helps someone to change in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nWalking out on abusive speech is a good way to handle it immediately.<br/>\nBut if you are in the middle of your computer turn, it sure doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork. You lose your turn as you leave and the mean one gets the<br/>\ncontrol he wanted. So it depends on whether or not walking out is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, we just almost never have these issues any more. We&#39;ve been<br/>\nconsistent in stopping cruelty between family members for over fifteen<br/>\nyears. And when something comes up now, I hear the victim say things<br/>\nlike, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ll give you a turn but you don&#39;t have to raise your<br/>\nvoice&quot; or &quot;You can&#39;t talk to me like that. Tell me what you want<br/>\nwithout being mean.&quot; And those things actually work because the kids<br/>\nare used to working their stuff out with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal has been to empower the victim and to hold the abuser<br/>\naccountable.

She says not to yell disapprovingly but<br/>\nto defuse the situation by separating the kids and stopping the action.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorry about the sources of the anger after you&#39;ve stopped the<br/>\npotential for harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the hitting is coming at you, I think you could do something<br/>\nsimilar. Grab the hands of the child and walk that child to another<br/>\npart of the room saying, &quot;Quick. Hands down. Stand here while you get<br/>\ncontrol of your body again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the response is &quot;flat&quot; (without anger or shock), the child will see<br/>\nthat you are taking control of his out of control feelings without<br/>\nshaming him. If you repeat that over and over again, he will slowly<br/>\nget the message that hitting isn&#39;t required to gain control of a<br/>\nsituation. He can turn to you instead and eventually will be able to<br/>\ncontrol himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo deal with the emotions that led to the hitting, we try to get our<br/>\nkids talking to each other with our help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe sit the two kids on the couch opposite each other. Then we ask each<br/>\nkid to express what he or she is feeling to the other child. The other<br/>\nchild is to listen and then say back to the first child what he or she<br/>\nexpressed. We help them to do this as there is usually lots of<br/>\nmiscommunication.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal isn&#39;t to lecture or fix the problem. It is to allow the kids<br/>\nto say what is really going on until there is some mutual<br/>\nunderstanding. We also ask them to think of ways to avoid the problem<br/>\nthat might come up again in the future. If there is a lot of anger and<br/>\nno movement, we sit quietly and wait. It has taken a long time sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis process is one we&#39;ve used for fifteen years. My oldest kids now<br/>\n(18 and 15) used to say how &quot;dumb&quot; it was to talk on the couch... yet<br/>\nnow they are the first to suggest it, even when we are out of sorts<br/>\nwith them or each other. One of the kids will say, &quot;Mom, you can&#39;t<br/>\nkeep going on with the day until you resolve things with X (child).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that it takes loads of hours to patiently model and<br/>\nsupport respectful disagreements. There are probably lots of ways to<br/>\ndo it too. But over time, if you care about it every time, they will<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107661,"nextTopicId":107664}}
