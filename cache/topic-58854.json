My last uncle on my dad&#39;s<br/>\nside used to take us flying as kids and he had horses and a pet pig.   My<br/>\nmom could never stand him but we loved him.

That&#39;s what I<br/>\ndid too for awhile so I guess it&#39;s genetic.   I still have and plant<br/>\nseeds from my dad&#39;s hand collected assortment and their offspring.   He&#39;s<br/>\nstill a big deal around here in spite of being  gone two years.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad served in WWII as a medic.

He was<br/>\nalso in Japan during the occupation and made friends with a Japanese man<br/>\nwho continued to correspond with my dad until he died. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs kids we were mostly afraid of him but in the last years of his life we<br/>\nbecame great friends and healed some and discovered we could understand<br/>\nand love one another.
