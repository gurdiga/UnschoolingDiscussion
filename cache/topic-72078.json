So some days I worry it is enough?  <br/>\n&gt; How is the reading and math going to come in <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My boys are now 6 & 8.  My 8 year old began reading... like more than just <br/>\nsounding out words... just after he turned 6.  Now he reads VERY well.  My six <br/>\nyear old will see the word &quot;van&quot; and say &quot;vacuum&quot;.  To him, every word that <br/>\nbegins with a &quot;v&quot; must be vacuum.  Kind of funny.  Also, he still mixes up his <br/>\n&quot;b&quot;s and &quot;d&quot;s.  I have done my best to convince him that the word &quot;bitch&quot; will <br/>\nnever be found in a Hooked on Phonics book  (ditch is what they are shooting <br/>\nfor    : )    Anyway, it seems that once they can read, we as moms can relax.  I <br/>\nhave a friend with a 15 yr old.  She reads beautifully and reads everything <br/>\n(very mature reader) despite the fact that she didn&#39;t read until she was 10.  <br/>\nMath has been accomplished to this point mostly by $$$$    A trip to the dollar <br/>\nstore... including tax... a gift of $20 from Grandma... what can that buy?  <br/>\nStuff like that.  Then Monopoly Jr.   Math has sort of taken care of itself.  I <br/>\nhave Dillon do workbooks just to have something to show an evaluator.  In <br/>\nFlorida, compulsory school age begins at 6, so I will register Matty this next <br/>\ncoming school year.  When people spend time with my boys, they are very struck <br/>\nby how verbal they are and how much they know about fish and bugs and money and <br/>\nbank proceedures and laundry and... well, the list goes on and on.  But... <br/>\ntelling time to the 5 minute mark and knowing place values to the 100 millions <br/>\nisn&#39;t something that has come up in our everyday life, so my boys don&#39;t know <br/>\nstuff like that.  BUT... they know how credit cards work and why it is better to <br/>\nsave up and then buy something rather than charge it   : )   ~Kris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72011,"nextTopicId":71498}}
