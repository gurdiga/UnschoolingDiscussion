Casey rolled a die and we <br/>\nsubtracted that many pages from the end page and that&#39;s the poem we <br/>\nwould read. Then she rolled 2 dice and would add those together and <br/>\nwe&#39;d subtract that number from the current poem page and read that <br/>\none. Then she rolled 3 dice...and on and on. I think we got up to 8 <br/>\ndice. Sometimes she would just count the dots to add all those <br/>\nnumbers. Sometimes she had some &quot;math facts&quot; that helped her go <br/>\nfaster. Sometimes I would show her how to combine dice to get 10&#39;s, <br/>\nwhich I always find the easiest way to add all those single digit <br/>\nnumbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got back to the beginning of the book I think we started <br/>\nadding the dice number to the pages. It was all very relaxed and the <br/>\nrules of our games were developed and changed on the fly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read all of the poems aloud to Casey, but I later heard her on the <br/>\nphone with a friend (long distance!). They were playing the same game <br/>\nand reading the poetry to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"echomygecko","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] cool poem","postDate":"1067442066","msgId":83395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NC4xYjVlNDNhOC4yY2QxMzk5MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":83392,"nextInTopic":83628,"prevInTime":83394,"nextInTime":83396,"topicId":83386,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/28/03 11:37:33 PM Central Standard Time, CelticFrau@aol.com writes: Listen to the musten ts child, listen to the don ts, listen to the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2020801921\">In a message dated 10/28/03 11:37:33 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CelticFrau@...\">CelticFrau@...</a> writes:<br/>\nListen to the musten&#39;ts child,<br/>\nlisten to the don&#39;ts,<br/>\nlisten to the shouldn&#39;ts,<br/>\nthe impossibles,<br/>\nthe won&#39;ts,<br/>\nListen to the never haves,<br/>\nthen listen close to me,<br/>\nanything can happen child,<br/>\nanything can be.<br/>\nSS<br/>\n#########<br/>\n<br/>\nShel Silverstein *Where the Sidewalk Ends*<br/>\nGood book, good poem.<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] cool poem","postDate":"1067437837","msgId":83392,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3Yy4yMjUwYTdjOS4yY2QxMjkwZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":83386,"nextInTopic":83395,"prevInTime":83391,"nextInTime":83393,"topicId":83386,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/28/2003 11:37:24 PM Central Standard Time, CelticFrau@aol.com writes: I ran across this poem on someone s siggy line on AOL Shel","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1100144092\">In a message dated 10/28/2003 11:37:24 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CelticFrau@...\">CelticFrau@...</a> writes:<br/>\nI ran across this poem on someone&#39;s siggy line on AOL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShel Silverstein.
