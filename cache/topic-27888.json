We have found that some &quot;friends&quot; (using the<br/>\nterm loosely here) are quite willing to lie about food our daughter has<br/>\ningested...and or feel that they are treating her by offering things she<br/>\nlikes,  but is not supposed to eat.

It was a big deal...lawyers and<br/>\neverything...about whether the school has the &#39;right&#39; to restrict what<br/>\nparents can pack in the little ones lunches just to enable TWO students to<br/>\nattend.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe &quot;control&quot; isn&#39;t the best description.  We have always tried to allow<br/>\nfor much choice within what&#39;s allowable.  And parents are the ones<br/>\n*choosing* what foods come into the home...thereby restricting or<br/>\ncontrolling the child&#39;s choices.  Vegetarians may or may not allow their<br/>\nchildren to be carnivores.....but I imagine that since they find it<br/>\nunacceptable,  they&#39;ve only allowed vegan eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am of the thinking that children need to be in charge of their eating as<br/>\nmuch as possible....if they can maintain an awareness of their body&#39;s<br/>\nhunger-satiation signals...as well as an awareness of the feelings they get<br/>\nfrom specific foods,  they&#39;ll most likely end up eating a balanced diet and<br/>\nmeet their unique body&#39;s needs.  With this guiding principle,  we hope the<br/>\nyoungsters will be able to try &#39;new&#39; foods when they have more freedom to<br/>\nchoose and determinr their own way (e.g.,  we have never once served<br/>\nbrussels sprouts here....they&#39;ll need to try those somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s the way this culture has been (and largely still is).
