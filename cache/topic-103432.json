I wasn&#39;t able to get online and respond as much as I&#39;d <br/>\nhave liked to, but just wanted to let you know I was reading.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I told the school today my kids won&#39;t be coming back.  My <br/>\ndd5.5 is not going back at all, and my ds7 will only go back until I <br/>\nget the word from the school district that our paperwork has been <br/>\naccepted (we live in PA and have a few hoops to jump through), but <br/>\nhis last day will be sometime this week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis list (and a couple others) and Sandra&#39;s articles have given me <br/>\nmuch to think about.  We&#39;re even hoping to make it to the conference <br/>\nin October.  I&#39;d especially love for my dh to go, he understands the <br/>\nbenefit of unschooling, but I&#39;d love for him to be as excited as me <br/>\nand the kids are, and I think him getting personal experiences would <br/>\nhelp. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing how when my 2 older kids were little this lifestyle <br/>\ncame so easy for us.  I read lots of Sandra&#39;s articles and related <br/>\nto lots of them, in particular, the one where she drove around going <br/>\nto the a few markets for a plum for Holly reminds me of the time my <br/>\nkids were 2 years and 6 months, it was fall and there were leaves <br/>\nall over.  Nick (2) wanted to jump in them, so we went out to get <br/>\none, and spent all afternoon raking the leaves into a pile and <br/>\nsplashing around in them.  We never actually raked them up, just <br/>\nplayed in them and left them there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen all of a sudden they were in school, I was pregnant with my <br/>\nthird and everything went out of whack.  I can&#39;t believe it took me <br/>\nthis long to realize why!  I&#39;m so excited to get back to the way <br/>\nthings were.  Thanks again for pushing me to do it sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nJill in PA<br/>\nds7, dd5.5, ds2.5, ds3mo</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103452,"nextTopicId":65833}}
