I was the kid <br/>\nwith the five-year plan all through high school and went off to <br/>\ncollege and found I didn&#39;t like what I&#39;d planned...so I transferred, <br/>\nchanged majors, etc. I graduated with a degree in Anthropology with <br/>\nanother 5-year plan in my head...again didn&#39;t happen. I LOVED <br/>\nAnthropology and am honestly very happy that I was able to study it <br/>\nthroughout college, but I doubt very much that anything I do in life <br/>\nwill be directly related to my degree - (although most of life <br/>\nrelates to Anth.).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father never finished college and has owned and successfully run <br/>\nnumerous businesses throughout my life - he found something he <br/>\nenjoyed doing (video and radio production) and figured out a way to <br/>\nmake some money at it (not a lot but enough to live on). He&#39;s <br/>\ncurrently running his own railing installation business and <br/>\ntransitioning back into real estate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is that having a plan at 15 doesn&#39;t necessarily make <br/>\nit any easier to get a job or have a life plan...If she&#39;s got an <br/>\ninterest I&#39;d suggest nurturing that - if she loves to read, maybe <br/>\nexplore careers in editing (there are a lot of freelance positions <br/>\nthat don&#39;t need a degree), write - explore writing or journalism <br/>\n(maybe she can write an article for the local paper - get a teen&#39;s <br/>\nperspective on something going on in your area), watch TV - see what <br/>\nit takes to be a television critic or work with a local theater or at <br/>\nthe tv station. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of colleges have certificate programs - programs meant to be <br/>\ntaken by people working full time so they take place in the evenings <br/>\nand weekends - that tend to be more geared toward real-world <br/>\napplication of interests and skills and not so much academia. (I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to take a Museum Studies one next year).<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it probably won&#39;t mean much to her to say don&#39;t worry about <br/>\nit, but honestly, don&#39;t worry about it. As I&#39;m sure you know she has <br/>\nplenty of time to figure out what she wants to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157311507,"authorName":"Linda","from":"Linda &lt;eaglefalconlark@...&gt;","profile":"eaglefalconlark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Just joined but not new","postDate":"1101162495","msgId":101314,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMTIyMjIyODE1Ljc0NzEyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwMjAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNudG1mNStpMGtwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101311,"nextInTopic":101315,"prevInTime":101313,"nextInTime":101315,"topicId":101310,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... careers that do not require a college degree so she can understand that she has options other than college, and I was hoping some members on this list ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1590481408\">--- myfunny4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Debbies4@...\">Debbies4@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;d like to give my daughter some information about<br/>\n </span></blockquote>careers that do not require a college degree so she<br/>\ncan understand that she has options other than<br/>\ncollege, and I was hoping some members on this list<br/>\ncould suggest a few resources.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an essay on college that might help:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unconventionalideas.com/wizard.html\">http://www.unconventionalideas.com/wizard.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know anyone who has not been to college?
