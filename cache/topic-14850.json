However, the children for whom this is<br/>\n&gt; true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>\n&gt; who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>\n&gt; themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>\n&gt; on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>\n&gt; justify the use of control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Alfie Kohn,  Punished by Rewards, p. 33.<br/>\n&gt; ********** </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14821,"nextTopicId":14840}}
