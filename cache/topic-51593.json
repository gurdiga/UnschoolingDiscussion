Sometimes I wonder if this is really an <br/>\n&gt; &quot;open&quot; list or if it&#39;s &quot;moderated&quot; from within by the *unschooling police*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I had to say this, because I&#39;ve noticed the same trend you have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The really cool thing about e-lists is that you can unsub at any time (check <br/>\nthe bottom of every post---directions!). No one is forcing anyone to remain <br/>\nwhere they are uncomfortable. REALLY!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Frank Smith says, &quot;We learn from the company we keep.&quot; The majority here <br/>\nLIKE the company more than 90% of the time---or we ignore it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this group IS kinda the &quot;Unschooling Police Force&quot;. I LIKE that. If <br/>\nyou&#39;re not sure what IS unschooling---really unschooling---the unschooling <br/>\nthat leaks into parenting and into a lifestyle, you come here. Ask away: free <br/>\nadvice and neat real life stories just for the asking! I&#39;ve found the most <br/>\narticulate, sensitive, and insightful folks I&#39;ve ever met HERE, in this forum <br/>\n(and I&#39;ve even had quite a few of them in my back yard! WOW!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you&#39;re not happy, there are options. Several folks have started their <br/>\nown unschooling lists after leaving Unschoolingdotcom in a huff. Those lists <br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to last long though!  And who wants a watered-down version of <br/>\nunschooling? Well, I guess there ARE a few---and those lists are out there. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd all lists that I&#39;ve found have a handful of &quot;regular&quot; posters and MANY <br/>\nlurkers. What&#39;s this list up to? 8-900? How many post on a regular basis? <br/>\n25-30? with 10 major &quot;leaders&quot;? Just like every other list I&#39;ve been on. The <br/>\n&quot;leaders&quot; are those that have more experience, more knowledge, and better <br/>\nways of explaining things.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompassion? Well, that comes and goes! &lt;G&gt; How many times can one hear the <br/>\nsame lame excuses without getting a bit peeved? Some handle it better than <br/>\nothers, certainly. But newbies are advised from the get-go to sit back and <br/>\nread a while, to comb the archives, and &quot;get the feel&quot; of this list before <br/>\njumping in. There is also the excellent resource of the unschooling.com <br/>\nmessage boards---actually easier to read than the archives (those damned <br/>\npop-ups!) with many of these same posters and others who don&#39;t like e-lists, <br/>\n(like AnneO). It&#39;s often (but not always) gentler there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;tone&quot; of some posts may be bothersome---just as with any large group. <br/>\nBut if you read them with humor and laughter in your &quot;head-voice&quot;, it&#39;ll come <br/>\nout better. I&#39;ve met MANY of these posters---they are VERY funny and maybe a <br/>\nlittle sarcastic (you all know who you are! &lt;BWEG&gt;), but none of it&#39;s meant <br/>\nin a mean way (well, unless they&#39;re attacked; then things can get mean).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the laughter button turned on in you &quot;head-voice&quot;, read/listen sweetly, <br/>\nand keep an open mind--just like with your children!  There&#39;s gobs of info <br/>\nhere if you&#39;re willing to listen. And if not, there are other lists. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81187,"nextTopicId":81245}}
