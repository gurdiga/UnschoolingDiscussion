It seems that some of our government<br/>\nrepresentatives decided at the last minute to add a rider to the<br/>\nAppropriation Bill that would allow livestock growers (Poultry, Beef -- This<br/>\nmeans DAIRY too, Pork ....) to feed their animals &#39;conventional&#39; feed and<br/>\nstill label and sell it as organic.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now as you know, it would be much cheaper to feed your livestock<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&#39;conventional&#39; feed and sell it for top dollar as organic.
