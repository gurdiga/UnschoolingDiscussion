My son has expressed strong interest, but the local groups say that it has to be a family affair...meaning we all have to join. I am not particularly interested, but I am considering it so my son can get involved.  Just wondering if anyone is involved in this type of activity? I wondered about the time commitment that is involved.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThis leads me to another question...how involved do you get in order for your child to pursue their interests? This re-enactment thing is totally my son&#39;s idea, but in order for him to do it I would have to.
