With some members","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1127331687\">Junior State of America - Ages 14-18<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been holding meetings of our Ohio JSA chapter of home<br/>\neducated teens for the past three years. With some members who have<br/>\nmoved or gone on to college, and others who have gone back to high<br/>\nschool, our chapter needs new teen members. And as we enter this<br/>\nexciting presidential election year, here is a great opportunity to<br/>\nparticipate in our government, hands-on. I mean, how can we change<br/>\nanything if we are not willing to participate? As JSA says, democracy<br/>\nis not a spectator sport.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been our chapter advisor and have attended most JSA events in<br/>\nour region. I have to say that from what I have observed this is a <br/>\ngreat group of teens. They cover the entire political gamut, from  <br/>\nanarchists to arch conservatives! For those intending to go to<br/>\ncollege, this is an excellent activity that looks really good on<br/>\ncollege and scholarship applications, too. Plus, it presents an<br/>\nopportunity to meet lots of other teens, to socialize, to meet<br/>\nimportant people in local, state and national government, to practice<br/>\npublic speaking, and to learn hands-on how our government really<br/>\nworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur district holds its spring session in Columbus, OH, right in the<br/>\nState Legislature, for Spring State and part of the Summer Symposia.<br/>\nThe other parts are held at Ohio State and University of Cincinnati.<br/>\nThen our region&#39;s Fall State is held in Cincinnati (will be<br/>\nelsewhere for other parts of the country, of course), and in February<br/>\nwe journey to our U. S. Capitol for Winter Congress in Washington,<br/>\nD. C. These are all such great opportunities for teens to participate<br/>\nin this totally teen-run group and all its great acitivities. I<br/>\nreally want to encourage others to investigate these programs, start<br/>\ntheir own home ed chapters so that home educated teens have a voice<br/>\nin U. S. politics. If you live in our district (Ohio, Tennessee, West<br/>\nVirginia, Kentucky, Indiana) please get in touch with me. And<br/>\neveryone interested can visit the JSA web site to learn more about<br/>\nJSA in their region of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the year local chapters meet for various activities: debates,<br/>\nthought talks, mock trials, caucuses, and lots of fun, the chance to<br/>\nmeet with other teens from all over the region. Founded in the<br/>\n1930s, this is a nationwide non-profit non-partisan high school age<br/>\npolitical group. We are looking forward to a most interesting year<br/>\nleading up to next year&#39;s presidential election. Email me if you have<br/>\nquestions. Next big event in our part of the country is Fall State,<br/>\nthis weekend in Cincinnati, then Winter Congress with a trip to<br/>\nWashington, D.C., in February.

Plenty of hands-<br/>\non opportunities out there, especially this next year.  But this is <br/>\none that I know about that might work for some teens.  I know it <br/>\ncould use far more home educated teen involvement, especially <br/>\nunschoolers, and is very open to us.
