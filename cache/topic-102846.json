It&#39;s definitely more <br/>\ntitle and class oriented, but treating children as &quot;lesser beings&quot; <br/>\nseems rampant in our country.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve managed to surround ourselves with people that really like <br/>\nkids and treat them with respect, so it&#39;s just not part of our daily <br/>\nlives. We hear and see stuff when we&#39;re in public of course, but <br/>\nwe&#39;ve been fortunate to build a wonderful community of respectful <br/>\npeople around us.<br/>\nEven in the classes they&#39;ve chosen, we&#39;ve lucked out for the most <br/>\npart (though Jared&#39;s Karate instructor was BIG into the &quot;sir&quot; thing).<br/>\nHang in there.
