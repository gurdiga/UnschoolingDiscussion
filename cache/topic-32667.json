They only make appropriate noises about women&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; rights when forced to do so. Upon returning to work 5 years ago after<br/>\n&gt; having my first child I was told &quot;Had you not taken maternity leave you<br/>\n&gt; would have gotten a better rating.&#39; I worked through half my maternity<br/>\n&gt; leave, writing and running programs for people and my boss knew about<br/>\n&gt; this but still since I had taken maternity leave I did not deserve to<br/>\n&gt; get a better rating. This was a large company, employing over 45,000<br/>\n&gt; people at the time. My brother and father are still more like Archie<br/>\n&gt; Bunker than anyone else I can think of.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also am a Christian and regularly attend church. There are a number of<br/>\n&gt; men that are totally and completely stuck on themselves and can &#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; have a decent conversation with a woman because they are MEN (beat chest<br/>\n&gt; like ape while saying). I refuse to allow them to dictate to me how I<br/>\n&gt; decide to worship. I know of a few people who have quit going to church<br/>\n&gt; because of this but I am going to stay there in their face and not quit<br/>\n&gt; doing something that I love just because some men are pigheaded. I have<br/>\n&gt; studied women in the Bible and how men really should act if they are<br/>\n&gt; Christians so I know that women really are not to be treated as badly as<br/>\n&gt; most church going men treat them. But back to the original point, many<br/>\n&gt; men in the church environment would be happy if women would be totally<br/>\n&gt; quite little lumps that were only available to do work that was &#39;fit for<br/>\n&gt; a woman&#39; as they see it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another area that is not directly connected to women but discrimination<br/>\n&gt; in general is the fact that there are still a large number of white<br/>\n&gt; people who will say in public that they are not racist but they really<br/>\n&gt; are. They won&#39;t say a word as long as they think a person from another<br/>\n&gt; race can hear them but in &#39;mighty white&#39; circles they make comments that<br/>\n&gt; are racist. I don&#39;t think the women&#39;s movement will get anywhere if the<br/>\n&gt; non-racist movement can&#39;t get anywhere. The people that I associate with<br/>\n&gt; that are more into unschooling aren&#39;t racist but I have met a few<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling families that made comments that were definitely racist. I<br/>\n&gt; think that real progress that can not be changed by voting someone new<br/>\n&gt; into the white house will take centuries not decades because of the<br/>\n&gt; underground current of discrimination that is there but is not voiced<br/>\n&gt; unless in a &#39;safe&#39; environment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sara<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Has anyone taken a good look at the general shift since the current<br/>\n&gt; &gt; occupant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the White House arrived?  If you want a good example, watch some of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; shows like Talk Back where the topic is Andrea Yates, and I quote, &quot;He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing his job by going to work and supporting his family.  Her family<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have been helping her.&quot;  This in response to the question of why he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; notice any problems or help out when he got home from work.

I think it&#39;s like a pendulum.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; women&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; movement is really relatively young in the grand scheme of things.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; They<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pushed until that pendulum swung way far out there.

I wonder at times how much is by design and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manipulation.  In the 80s Betty Friedan wrote another book called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _The Second Stage_ and in it she discussed where the Movement should<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go next.  It was to family rights - parent&#39;s rights - so for example<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all parents could take time off to be with their children, not just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the pregnant parent.

They only make appropriate noises about women&#39;s<br/>\nrights when forced to do so. Upon returning to work 5 years ago after<br/>\nhaving my first child I was told &quot;Had you not taken maternity leave you<br/>\nwould have gotten a better rating.&#39; I worked through half my maternity<br/>\nleave, writing and running programs for people and my boss knew about<br/>\nthis but still since I had taken maternity leave I did not deserve to<br/>\nget a better rating. This was a large company, employing over 45,000<br/>\npeople at the time. My brother and father are still more like Archie<br/>\nBunker than anyone else I can think of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also am a Christian and regularly attend church. There are a number of<br/>\nmen that are totally and completely stuck on themselves and can &#39;t even<br/>\nhave a decent conversation with a woman because they are MEN (beat chest<br/>\nlike ape while saying). I refuse to allow them to dictate to me how I<br/>\ndecide to worship. I know of a few people who have quit going to church<br/>\nbecause of this but I am going to stay there in their face and not quit<br/>\ndoing something that I love just because some men are pigheaded. I have<br/>\nstudied women in the Bible and how men really should act if they are<br/>\nChristians so I know that women really are not to be treated as badly as<br/>\nmost church going men treat them. But back to the original point, many<br/>\nmen in the church environment would be happy if women would be totally<br/>\nquite little lumps that were only available to do work that was &#39;fit for<br/>\na woman&#39; as they see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother area that is not directly connected to women but discrimination<br/>\nin general is the fact that there are still a large number of white<br/>\npeople who will say in public that they are not racist but they really<br/>\nare. They won&#39;t say a word as long as they think a person from another<br/>\nrace can hear them but in &#39;mighty white&#39; circles they make comments that<br/>\nare racist. I don&#39;t think the women&#39;s movement will get anywhere if the<br/>\nnon-racist movement can&#39;t get anywhere. The people that I associate with<br/>\nthat are more into unschooling aren&#39;t racist but I have met a few<br/>\nhomeschooling families that made comments that were definitely racist. I<br/>\nthink that real progress that can not be changed by voting someone new<br/>\ninto the white house will take centuries not decades because of the<br/>\nunderground current of discrimination that is there but is not voiced<br/>\nunless in a &#39;safe&#39; environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Has anyone taken a good look at the general shift since the current<br/>\n&gt; occupant<br/>\n&gt; of the White House arrived?

For those who were old enough to be <br/>\ncognizent (I was a teen) when it was first happening, they were TRULY up <br/>\nagainst the Archie Bunkers of the earth.  &quot;I don&#39;t mind my wife having a job <br/>\nas long as the house is clean and my dinner&#39;s on the table&quot; was not a joke.  <br/>\nIt was real.   And women in the sciences were being treated very badly.  I <br/>\nhave a friend who got a master&#39;s degree in engineering around 1980 and went <br/>\nto work at Sandia National labs.  She was 30is, working with a bunch of 50 <br/>\nand 60 year old men, mostly ex-military, and they ignored her, belittled her, <br/>\nasked her to do girl-jobs (the secretarial end of their project&#39;s work) and <br/>\nto get them food, at first.  When she pointed out &quot;engineer,&quot; they just kind <br/>\nof ignored her for a while.  Forgot to invite her to meetings.  That was just <br/>\n20 years ago.  They would have felt they had &quot;won&quot; if she had gone home to <br/>\nstay with her child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe women&#39;s movement accomplished a LOT, lots more than most people realize.  <br/>\nMany states (most, I think) in the 1970&#39;s didn&#39;t have any provision in law to <br/>\ncharge a married man with raping his wife.  In some places, rape was defined <br/>\nas involving a woman not your spouse (in what exact phrasing in which states <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure anymore, but I used to be able to discuss the local laws because <br/>\nI worked in the rape crisis  center a while in college).   Young women who <br/>\nhear that now find it hard to believe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were women then (one ironically made a good living at it) who said <br/>\nwomen SHOULD stay home and do what their husband said, and just be <br/>\nhousewives.  So the lines were drawn there, with a political movement <br/>\nopposing &#39;women&#39;s lib&#39; and calling for women to be subject to their husbands. <br/>\n That movement, of course, paid little to no attention to single women or <br/>\ndivorced or widowed women.

If other<br/>\nwomen misunderstand why I&#39;m at home when I love to be at home, it is<br/>\nbecause they have a negative image of a woman staying at home.  When they<br/>\nsee me at home even though it causes financial troubles, they think I am<br/>\nlazy and irresponsible.  But I say, &quot;I am me and you are you.&quot;  If they<br/>\nwant to not be home, then God bless &#39;em.  If they work because they feel<br/>\ncoerced to, then God help &#39;em to realize there is another way,<br/>\nindividualized to them.  I know right now that if I want to work, I can<br/>\nwork it into my schedule.  I don&#39;t have to work 9 to 5.  Been there, done<br/>\nthat, hated that.  My determination to do what seems right in my heart<br/>\nfor me and for us as a family has led me to see the options that are<br/>\nthere for me.  I know I could work swing or graveyard part time.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen there done that too.  It was better than 9 to 5, but not best for<br/>\nme.  I have a plan. When my kids go to college, so will I.  My 14 year<br/>\nold is saving his money for college.  He is presently pursuing a job<br/>\nworking 24 hours a week.  He has a state form to give to his employer to<br/>\nsend to the state, saying it is legal for him to work 24 hours a week. <br/>\nHe was working with his Dad, but said he wanted a steady job with steady<br/>\npay.  He wants to be an architectural engineer.  He has plans.  My plan<br/>\nis, once my kids are away from home, I want to go to college, then work<br/>\nin the field of my choice and save all my money, except for a percentage<br/>\nfor spending, on retirement.  That&#39;s because my husband doesn&#39;t think of<br/>\nthe future.  But why should I lose my glorious present to ensure a safe<br/>\nfuture?  I will wait until I am ready, then I will go back to work.  I<br/>\nhave had weekend jobs and part time jobs.  And the truth is, it was never<br/>\nin the field of my choice, because I did what was expected of me instead<br/>\nof following my dreams.  I want to give my children the opportunity to<br/>\nfollow their dreams rather than sit in a rigid school environment<br/>\nlearning to keep status quo and follow the leader.<br/>\nIt&#39;s late and I may be rambling.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Choices ( a little OT-ish)","postDate":"1016509282","msgId":32685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzE5MDM0MC5nMkozZUNiYzAyMTUyN0BueWNzbXRwMW91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32678,"nextInTopic":32705,"prevInTime":32684,"nextInTime":32686,"topicId":32667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She thinks she is protecting me from the mistakes she made.  Excuse me, it&#39;s about choices and doing what I enjoy and find satisfaction in right?  We now have three blessings and a successful work from home business that I love and allows me to support and encourage my kids in their learning endeavors-but in her eyes that doesn&#39;t count.  We have given up on even trying to explain unschooling to her because she just doesn&#39;t get it.  I find it amusing that my husband&#39;s grandmother who was a public school teacher, is the only one in the family that is supportive of our unschooling lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another thing.  In college, staying home and being a full-time mother was never presented as an option and was pretty much looked down upon.  Which was difficult for me, because deep down in my heart I knew that I wanted to be a full-time mother and not an advertising executive.  My major was Communication Studies..Public Relations and Professional Writing...<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay..I am just babbling now..sorry ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving Joyfully,<br/>\nLara .     <br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: katyclark1969 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katyclark1969@...\">katyclark1969@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, March 18, 2002 6:04 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Choices ( a little OT-ish)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does anyone else agree with me that one unforseen consequence of <br/>\n  the &quot;women&#39;s movement&quot; is that a woman who choses to stay home and <br/>\n  raise her children is somehow settling and that she really would like <br/>\n  to be out in the working world?
