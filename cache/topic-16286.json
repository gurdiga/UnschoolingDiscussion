My 8dd listened<br/>\nto the tape and read along in the book.  Her idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, they are not my favorite books.  I think that Harry would be<br/>\na mental wreck if he really had been raised in a closet and so<br/>\nabused/neglected.  I don&#39;t like the way that Hermione is put down for<br/>\nstudying so hard.  I think it&#39;s phony that witches and wizards don&#39;t get<br/>\nto do magic until after they go to Hogwarts.  And why would a magic<br/>\nfamily like the Weasleys be so poor?  Why couldn&#39;t you just magic your<br/>\nkids new school clothes, etc.  But HEY, it is FICTION!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight... Stay Active...
