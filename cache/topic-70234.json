Every once in awhile I get a <br/>\nschooly thought, and try to banish it from my being!<br/>\nMy son(7) has never been to school, I used to try to get him to do work books <br/>\non math , it was met with much resentment and refusal. I tried many things to <br/>\nforce him to do them, I shamed, I jollied, I threatened. It was something I <br/>\nwould pull out sporadically, when I felt anxious about the lack of schooly <br/>\nthings being done. I thought that unschooling was more about having workbooks <br/>\naround, and he would pick them up and do them on his own.LOLOL<br/>\nI have stopped that annoying habit, and have been living life with my son <br/>\nafter reading Sandra&#39;s site and unschooling.com stuff. He is a cool kid, and <br/>\nhas always loved numbers and math concepts. A few weeks ago, he asked what a <br/>\nquarter was worth. I said 25 cents, he said that if a quarter was 25 cents, <br/>\nthen the quarter box of rice crispies that was left must 25percent of the <br/>\nbox. YIKES!!!<br/>\nJust the other day, we are driving to dear Maureen&#39;s house, and Tommy is <br/>\nasking about having his hair colored , and asks how much. I said around 50 <br/>\nbucks.Ds then proceeds to tell me that he will save up his allowance for <br/>\nthat. <br/>\n&quot;If I save my allowance, it will need to be 10 allowances to make 50 <br/>\ndollars(5dollars every 2 weeks) so that would be 20 weeks. There&#39;s 52 weeks <br/>\nin a year, so that would almost 1/2 a year.&quot;<br/>\nOk, now I am really impressed with this. The child just gets stuff!! How <br/>\nwonderful!!<br/>\nNo coercing, shaming forcing to &quot;Do&quot; math . He just gets it.<br/>\nYahoo, it works!!<br/>\nWe will continue to live life, and learn in this house!!<br/>\nNancy, exultant in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70192,"nextTopicId":69912}}
