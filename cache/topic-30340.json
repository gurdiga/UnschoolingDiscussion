After many <br/>\n&gt; (15+)<br/>\n&gt; attempts to get a new 504 meeting, and no one returning my calls, I <br/>\n&gt; finally<br/>\n&gt; left a note for the principal saying that Andrew wasn&#39;t going to school <br/>\n&gt; until<br/>\n&gt; she saw me. It took her 9 school days to call me- then they marked him <br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; truant for those days because I failed to date the note and had no <br/>\n&gt; proof of<br/>\n&gt; when I left it.<br/>\n&gt; ====================<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep. That sounds pretty typical.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; =======================<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, she was a new teacher but I was there every day, trying to talk to <br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt; and get help for whatever she needed.

She obviously didn&#39;t care for her <br/>\nstudents.  I hope you complained to the principal about her.  It&#39;s <br/>\nunfortunate that so many (most) teachers don&#39;t want anyone around in <br/>\ntheir classroom - not even other teachers.  It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to <br/>\nhide something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always welcomed and encouraged parents to visit the classroom.  I <br/>\nfound it helped with classroom management.  The kids always seemed to <br/>\nbehave a little better and were more respectful toward me and each other <br/>\nwhen there was someone else in the classroom.  I always wanted to share <br/>\nwith them what was going on in my classroom.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ==========================<br/>\n&gt; I agree--everyone dropped the ball--but there&#39;s more to this story...<br/>\n&gt; I work in a major grocery chain in our community and on 3 different <br/>\n&gt; occasions<br/>\n&gt; I had kids from his classrom some in the store and tell me that &quot;Mrs. <br/>\n&gt; Brennan<br/>\n&gt; was being mean to Andrew&quot;--lots of verbal abuse--screaming at him and<br/>\n&gt; slamming her hand down on his desk. Of course when I questiond her she <br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; denied it, and Andrew never told me because he was too afraid. I know <br/>\n&gt; that he<br/>\n&gt; was not a behavior problem--he just required too much of her time ......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nancy S<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=========================<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You did the right thing to pull him out.  She sounds like a b_____ and <br/>\n&gt; was responsible for a very unhealthy classroom environment.  Actually, <br/>\n&gt; I think schools, as a whole, are very unhealthy.  They have a culture <br/>\n&gt; all their own that does not resemble real life.  Schools are not good <br/>\n&gt; places for children to be.  Everyone is under such tremendous stress <br/>\n&gt; that too many times they behave in ways that they would never exhibit <br/>\n&gt; in the real world.  I hate to admit it, but I am guilty of it myself.  <br/>\n&gt; But, it didn&#39;t happen too often, and I was aware that the stress and <br/>\n&gt; nature of the environment in the school affected my behavior in a <br/>\n&gt; negative way.  I think perhaps too many teachers don&#39;t realize this and <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t check themselves.  I have a hard time believing that some of the <br/>\n&gt; behaviors I have seen out of teachers in the schools is the same <br/>\n&gt; behavior they exhibit elsewhere.  I believe the same is true for many <br/>\n&gt; children.  It has a lot to do with all the stress present in that <br/>\n&gt; environment.  A school is the last place I would ever want my children <br/>\n&gt; to be in.  These are just my opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mimi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

(it should have taken place no <br/>\n&gt; later<br/>\n&gt; than October). At the meeting I asked the teacher why she had not made <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; accomodations that were outlined in the plan ( I had asked her on an <br/>\n&gt; almost<br/>\n&gt; daily basis up to this point), she replied that she didn&#39;t have a copy <br/>\n&gt; of the<br/>\n&gt; plan. That&#39;s when the special ed director realized that this teacher <br/>\n&gt; was  a<br/>\n&gt; complete idiot, as I had been telling her. (she could&#39;ve gotten a copy <br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; me or the special ed director, but never asked) Anything the teacher <br/>\n&gt; said<br/>\n&gt; after that point in the meeting was looked upon with suspision and I <br/>\n&gt; caught<br/>\n&gt; her in an out-and-out lie  and called her on it. (she responded by <br/>\n&gt; stating<br/>\n&gt; that she &quot;didn&#39;t remember saying that&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m defending the teacher here, I&#39;m sure if <br/>\n&gt;you felt she lied, then she probably did.  But, my question is, HOW COME <br/>\n&gt;THE SPECIAL ED ADMINISTRATORS DIDN&#39;T MAKE SURE SHE WAS GIVEN A &gt;COPY OF <br/>\n&gt;THE MODIFICATIONS TO KEEP IN HER FILES IN HER CLASSROOM?  I feel that <br/>\n&gt;should be part of that administrators job - to make sure all the <br/>\n&gt;teachers have their mods in their classrooms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first day of school I informed the teacher that Andrew has Asperger <br/>\nSyndrome and he had a 504 Accomodation plan-she said that she saw that in his <br/>\nfile, and she never asked for a copy so I assumed that she had one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;  I didn&#39;t feel it was right that it be eaten up by continuous <br/>\n&gt;trips to the Special Ed office, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ADMINISTRATORS &gt;THERE <br/>\n&gt;HAVE SEVERAL SECRETARIES AND STUDENT HELPERS WHO COULD &gt;EASILY <br/>\n&gt;HAND-DELIVER THESE VERY IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS TO THE VERY &gt;BUSY <br/>\n&gt;TEACHERS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand the frustration,but in our case, the teacher never even made <br/>\nany attempt to get his file, and you are right about the admin staff--the <br/>\nprincipal didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s butt about my son&#39;s situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;The administrators should remember that the teachers are very busy <br/>\n&gt;serving their many students.  They should be the ones who put those mods <br/>\n&gt;in the teacher&#39;s box or deliver them to the classroom.  The teachers are <br/>\n&gt;under much more stress and are much busier than those administrators.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case the principal wouldn&#39;t give me the time of day.
