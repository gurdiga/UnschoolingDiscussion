So all day I did nothing. Nothing,<br/>\nthat is, except what I wanted. My house has been in a total disarray<br/>\nsince the holidays, so I decided to start putting away some of the<br/>\npresents and stuff. When I unpacked some mugs I got, 5dd thought that the<br/>\nbubble sacks that they were packed in were pretty cool. She got out her<br/>\nbeads, pompoms, buttons, yarn, etc. and glued faces and hair on them to<br/>\nmake hand puppets that she called &quot;poppets&quot;. As she is doing this, I hear<br/>\nher and 3yo sis talking back and forth in jibberish. I inquired what<br/>\nlanguage she was speaking and she told me &quot;Jennish&quot; (her name is Jenni).<br/>\nI went back to my task at hand, and the three of us continued to only<br/>\ntalk to each other in this newfound language, and could pretty much tell<br/>\nwhat each other was saying. While she was waiting for the glue to dry on<br/>\nher &quot;poppets&quot;, she started writing me little notes written in &quot;Jennish&quot;.<br/>\nWhen I didn&#39;t understand what she was trying to tell me in the notes she<br/>\ngot very frustrated with me. &quot;But Mom, you knew what I meant when I<br/>\ntalked Jennish, how come you don&#39;t when I write Jennish?&quot; Then we got<br/>\ninto a discussion about communication, and how her words were not the<br/>\nonly way I understood what she wanted. I explained that I also watch her<br/>\neyes and her hands, and that you can&#39;t see them when you are reading<br/>\nsomething. Then she asked me if that is why I took so long doing my<br/>\ne-mails. I thought, hmmm.....very observant. I told her yes, I have a<br/>\nhard time because I don&#39;t always know how people intend to mean things,<br/>\nand being fairly new at this whole computer thing, I don&#39;t know how to<br/>\nconvey and decipher <br/>\ne-motions very well. It would be easier if I could see their eyes and<br/>\nhands. She thought about this and went back to her poppets. After a while<br/>\nor so, she came back to me, finding me buried in a load of wash. &quot;Look<br/>\nMom. My poppets have their own language too&quot;, as she proceeded to pop the<br/>\nbubbles to make them talk. I asked her if she knew what they meant. She<br/>\nsaid, &quot;No, but I know they are happy.&quot; &quot;How do you know they are happy?&quot;<br/>\nAnd her reply was this:<br/>\n&quot;Mom, sometimes you have to look at mouths too. See the smile I glued<br/>\non?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a great day!
