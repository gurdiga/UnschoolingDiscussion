I think I answered most of his<br/>\nquestions.  It is LONG.  I think about this issue a<br/>\nlot as there is  occasionally a death I hear of.<br/>\nUsually (it seems to me) there is a MISTAKE made that<br/>\ncould have been avoided with a little thought.  A<br/>\ncouple of years ago a Navy couple (near where I<br/>\nlive)lost a child when the father smothered the baby<br/>\nby sleeping on a sofa with her.  To me that is a<br/>\nspecial circumstance.  Sofa&#39;s are particular dangerous<br/>\nto babies and toddlers, anyway.  All that upholstery<br/>\non three sides, cushions with spaces for little ones<br/>\nto get wedged into. Then a Papa who accidently fell<br/>\nasleep. There is a short on the local news every few<br/>\nmonths telling parents not to seep with children<br/>\n......due to the mistake of this person. As if we<br/>\nshould ALL feel guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI SLEPT WITH MY CHILDREN AS BABIES AND TODDLERS AND<br/>\nEVEN BIGGER<br/>\n<br/>\n....I have four sons, all breast fed, and all slept<br/>\nwith me.  Three are adults now, and the youngest is 7.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest (27)is married (7 years) and cohabitates<br/>\n(ha!) with his wife. Queen size bed. Hand made quilts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond son (25) lives with his girl friend (3 years).<br/>\nQueen size bed.  Hand made quilts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird son (20) lives in his own place and rents out<br/>\ntwo of the bedrooms to his bachelor friends.  It looks<br/>\nlike it too!! They have a band. He sleeps in the<br/>\nsingle bed that his Daddy made for him. Hand made<br/>\nquilts, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe littlest (7) sleeps in his room, usually alone in<br/>\na double bed (the grownups hand-me-down when we got a<br/>\nking size) with lots of stuffed animals and pillows,<br/>\nhand made quilts,after one or both parents read to<br/>\nhim.  Mama (me)lays beside him while he falls asleep .<br/>\nHe chats (sometimes interminably). <br/>\n<br/>\nI did this for the older boys, too. Sometimes, when I<br/>\nam (was)particularly fatigued I fall asleep, too, and<br/>\nawaken 1 to 6 hours later and get up.  Once in a while<br/>\nI sleep all night. Sometimes the 7 year old<br/>\n(now)awakens and comes to climb in (my side of the<br/>\nbed) with his parents in the early morning. The older<br/>\nboys did, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest and youngest have sleep apnea (as do<br/>\nGrandparents and the youngest&#39;s Daddy).  It is my<br/>\nthought that that may be a source of SIDS......but who<br/>\nknows?  Anyway I monitored their sleep and touched<br/>\nthem to restore breathing when it seems too long<br/>\nbetween breaths, to me.  It has been documented that<br/>\nchildren do adopt the sleep patterns of their mother.<br/>\nUnfortunately I am and insomniac. Or perhaps<br/>\nfortunately, as I am always alert to the children. Any<br/>\nchildren in the house!! I had custody of a younger<br/>\nsister.....who lived with me off and on and slept with<br/>\nme from age 6 months. I also have had other children<br/>\nstay with me for extended periods of time.  I read to<br/>\nall of them (or sang) and let them talk, and stayed by<br/>\nthem to go to sleep until they seemed to want to be<br/>\nalone.  About age 6,7, or 10 or off and on.....each<br/>\none slightly different.  More if a crisis was<br/>\nhappening (from their point of view).<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER I did find that neither of my husbands (first<br/>\nhusband is Daddy to the three older boys....second to<br/>\nthe youngest) was alert to a child in the bed!! ELBOWS<br/>\nwere the worst hazard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey were also not concerned about nudity.  I (it is<br/>\njust my opinion as a survivor of sexual abuse) do not<br/>\nfeel (think) that children of any age should sleep<br/>\nwith naked adults.  Cuddling is good, sex or any hint<br/>\nof it with children is not. The children may<br/>\ninstinctively want to pursue those inclinations, but<br/>\nit is up to the care giver to redirect the behaviors.<br/>\nMy husbands did not want to give up sleeping nude due<br/>\nto my concern for the children.  They preferred for<br/>\nthe babies to be elsewhere anyway.  So ate sleeping<br/>\narrangements were up to me to fit around everyone&#39;s<br/>\nelse&#39;s needs.  As it USUALLY is with most things and<br/>\nMamma&#39;s and children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel strongly that little children shouldn&#39;t have to<br/>\nbe lonely, especially if there is a parent or two, or<br/>\ngrandparent or responsible sibling or SOMEBODY<br/>\nanywhere near. That SOMEBODY in my house,is me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo deal with the Daddy problem (problem for me, not<br/>\nfor the Daddy) I stayed awake until EVERYONE was<br/>\nasleep, (still do)or in their own beds asleep.  The<br/>\nparental bed with the older boys was a double bed..not<br/>\nbig enough!! With the babies I often just held them<br/>\nall night, in a rocker or in the crook of my arm while<br/>\nlying down.  But I had to stay awake enough to hold<br/>\nonto them. When they were bigger I ended up balanced<br/>\non the side of the children&#39;s beds (mattresses on the<br/>\nfloor at first) or holding hands with the older and<br/>\nhuggling (cuddling) the youngest or pushing all the<br/>\nbeds together and having my arms around<br/>\neverybody.....If there was a baby, he got a side all<br/>\nto himself as I didn&#39;t trust anyone else to stay alert<br/>\nenough for long enough. Youngest son&#39;s Daddy and I<br/>\nhave a king size bed now......the elbow problem was<br/>\n(is) much easier to deal with and siblings were in<br/>\ntheir own rooms in their own beds indulging in the<br/>\nthings teens like to do. However we had a double bed<br/>\nfor the first couple of years.  I made a pallet on the<br/>\nfloor, for myself and the baby, for safety. I was too<br/>\ntired to stay awake all night watching out for Daddy&#39;s<br/>\nelbow or to keep the baby from falling out of the bed.<br/>\n  When he had his own room, (we moved when he was<br/>\nalmost one) there was matress on the floor (he could<br/>\nclimb out of a crib as soon as he could pull<br/>\nup....about 7 or 8 months...DANGER) The crib was only<br/>\nused when he was tiny for me to go to the bathroom or<br/>\nchange clothes!! With the matress he noticed if he<br/>\nfell out, but he wasn&#39;t hurt. He could get up from a<br/>\nnap safely. <br/>\n<br/>\nI traded the crib to my sister-in-law for a wardrobe. <br/>\nHer child seep all night from about 2 months...and<br/>\nNEVER, even at over 2 years old, climbed out! She had<br/>\nand intercom in his room, which was on a different<br/>\nfloor, even.  Dunno if their power ever went out.<br/>\nMaybe it was battery powered.  He never slept in the<br/>\nparental bed.  She attempted to breastfeed,<br/>\nunsuccessfully.  Perhaps not related to sleeping<br/>\narrangements. They have two older children from my<br/>\nbrother&#39;s first marraige.  One of which stayed with me<br/>\nwhen she was little (1 year old).<br/>\n<br/>\nI either sat up or slept with all of my children when<br/>\nthey were ill.  Each has been ill with respiratory<br/>\nflue, one had pneumonia, all had asthma reactions to<br/>\nflue, third son had an intasaseption, two have sleep<br/>\napnea, then there were the ordinary things....chicken<br/>\npox (yuck) allergies (stuffy heads, can&#39;t breathe)<br/>\nvomiting, fevers, diarrhea etc, etc.  How can a parent<br/>\nkeep track of these things in another room? WHAT IF? <br/>\nA child could easily aspirate regurgitated yuck.  Who<br/>\nknows WHAT would have happened if I wasn&#39;t right<br/>\nthere?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI baby in the bed is sort of like a leaky hot water<br/>\nbottle!! (not my analogy but I like it) Daddy&#39;s seem<br/>\nmore disturbed by the leakiness than I was.  But with<br/>\nthe first three sons, the house was COLD. (the toilet<br/>\nwas frozen.  My fish bowl froze solid).  Even with<br/>\nfooted sleepers and snow suits, I felt that the babies<br/>\nneeded ME to make sure they were warm in the winter (I<br/>\ndid NOT use disposable diapers)....and not too hot in<br/>\nthe HOT summers or with fevers.  Cool cloths, fanning,<br/>\netc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy little sister used to pull the covers over her head<br/>\nto keep warm.  She never did learn to leave a<br/>\nbreathing hole!  I had to do that for her.  As she was<br/>\na BIG girl when I got permanent custody of her I would<br/>\ngo into her room and uncover her face.  As she<br/>\nrealized her face was uncovered she would pull the<br/>\ncovers up some more, exposing her feet.....then get a<br/>\nlittle more chilled and pull them up some more,<br/>\nuncovering her legs!! and get more chilled.....till I<br/>\ncovered her again.  More cover and a night-cap (hat)<br/>\ndidn&#39;t help.  Then she would get too hot and kick<br/>\neverything off and get cold again. She has been<br/>\nmarried (with 3 children) for 20 years now, has a<br/>\nqueen size bed. She slept with me until I had lovers. <br/>\nI did not want to share that aspect of my life with<br/>\nher. (ha!) She did not sleep with my babies.  She was<br/>\none of those all elbow and knee everywhere type of big<br/>\nkids. And she might have suffocated them with the<br/>\ncovers pulled up too high or ?????  She didn&#39;t sleep<br/>\nin the bed with her babies either.  And they all slept<br/>\nthrough the night from about 3 weeks (WOW).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys don&#39;t have children yet.  Dunno if they will.<br/>\nThey older three think it may be more than they want<br/>\nto bother with....it is a lot of that!! And I&#39;m glad<br/>\nthat they acknowledge what they prefer to do with<br/>\ntheir time.  An ignored child is so sad. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has adult adopted kids of his first wife<br/>\n(her natural children).  She NEVER slept with the<br/>\nchildren. Put them in bed, let them cry. Their<br/>\ndaughter, now has two children.  She belongs to the<br/>\nPut Them In Bed And Let Them Cry School, too. The<br/>\nadult son (Air Force) has two children.

The only evidence <br/>\nthat coroners=20\u000f<br/>\nand forensic pathologists come across, of course, <br/>\nfailures of the=20\u000f<br/>\nworst kind, ---which almost always occur in very <br/>\ndangerous urban=20\u000f<br/>\nenvironments environments.\u000e It is easy to understand <br/>\nwhy so many=20\u000f<br/>\nforensic pathologists have such a bad opinion of <br/>\ncosleeping in the=20\u000f<br/>\nform of &quot;bedsharing&quot;.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nOf course, any infant deaths--whether small or large, <br/>\nunder any=20\u000f<br/>\ncircumstance are tragic and impressive. What I am <br/>\nhoping is that we=20\u000f<br/>\nin the lactation/infant sleep research fields can begin <br/>\nto provide a=20\u000f<br/>\ndifferent set of numbers. What\u000e I have in mind as a <br/>\ncounter defense=20\u000f<br/>\nis also anecdotal--but all of the bedsharing death <br/>\nstatistics that=20\u000f<br/>\nare making the news likewise are also anecdotal.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nSo hear is the plan. Any improvements to it--are <br/>\nwelcome but here goes.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nI am interested in hearing and collecting (and <br/>\ncategorizing)\u000e success=20\u000f<br/>\nstories, especially, numbers of parents who <br/>\nsuccessfully co-slept=20\u000f<br/>\nwith any or all of their children, and learning how <br/>\nthey did it, how=20\u000f<br/>\nlong they did it, why they did it, and, in retrospect, <br/>\nwhat they now=20\u000f<br/>\nthink about it.
