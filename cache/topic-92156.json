We are busy again <br/>\ntoday, but tomorrow we&#39;ll be home - and I just know we will all be <br/>\n&#39;bored&#39;, that we will all sit around playing on the computer, watching <br/>\ntv, staying inside most of the time even if it is sunny and we should be <br/>\noutside enjoying the last of summer here in New Zealand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this, because this is how we react to being busy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, the busy-ness is chosen activities rather than ones imposed on <br/>\nus by others, so it will only take us a couple of days to recover (well, <br/>\none day for the kids, 2 or 3 for me!).  When I think back to my school <br/>\ndays, several decades ago, I remeber it took me half the holidays to <br/>\nrecover from school enough to enjoy the second half.  Same when I was <br/>\nworking in jobs that I had because I needed a job, rather than jobs I <br/>\nchose because I wanted to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have watched many kids come out of school, or school-at-home <br/>\nsituations, over the 18 years we been homeschooling.  The ones that fell <br/>\nenthusiastically into a &#39;self-motivated&#39; zest for learning usually <br/>\ncrashed into a pile of resentment and boredom after a few weeks / <br/>\nmonths.  They were, in fact, still operating out of perceived others&#39; <br/>\nexpecation, when they appeared to be doing so &#39;well&#39;.  The ones that <br/>\nstill felt comfortable enough in their Selves, and comfortable enough <br/>\nwith their families, tend to do the bored blahs at the beginning.  I <br/>\nthink it means that, in general, thses kids are less lost that the other <br/>\nkind.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really hard to sit and watch, but though strewing is a great idea, <br/>\nand he will probably eventually pick up on some of the &#39;strewings&#39;, it <br/>\nwill happen a lot quicker if he feels that he is free not to - that he <br/>\nis free to just be blah.  It&#39;s almost like creating a vacuum inside, <br/>\nletting go / getting rid of &#39;stuff&#39; until an invisible point is reached <br/>\nand suddenly the kid is doing all kinds of things. But there&#39;s no <br/>\ntelling when it will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nCally<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;my ds has the blahs and dh is wondering if he will ever be interested in<br/>\n&gt;anything. <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Son has the blahs","postDate":"1079984375","msgId":92178,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE2Mzc0NEFBLTdDMzgtMTFEOC1BQTdDLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PElORU5MQU5QUENKSEFJUE9NRklPR0VJSENFQUEua3Jpc3VsYW1AdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PElORU5MQU5QUENKSEFJUE9NRklPR0VJSENFQUEua3Jpc3VsYW1AdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":92171,"nextInTopic":92183,"prevInTime":92177,"nextInTime":92179,"topicId":92156,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
