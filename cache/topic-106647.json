He is a teacher in elementary/jr.<br/>\nhigh level schools in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were amazed at how the schools operate there.  The<br/>\nstudents have three uniforms - a lighter-weight<br/>\nuniform and a heavy-weight uniform and a &#39;gym<br/>\nclothes&#39;-type uniform.  They change them throughout<br/>\nthe day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe classrooms in this particular town (and Dan told<br/>\nus it is the norm) do not have heat or A/C.  There are<br/>\nno janitors.  The kids are responsible for cleaning<br/>\nthe school every day.  Lunch begins with a ceremony<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t ever comprehend fully but involves two<br/>\nstudents at the front of the room with signs on long<br/>\npoles (so everyone can see) that look like a countdown<br/>\nfrom 10 to 1 before anyone can eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teachers are rather physical with the students,<br/>\npoking them or thumping their heads, etc.  The<br/>\nstudents have their school day followed by clubs of<br/>\nvarious kinds.  Many of them are gone from 6AM to 6PM<br/>\nevery day, including Saturday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a very different experience from any I have had<br/>\nor seen here in the US.  On the one hand, I could see<br/>\nhow their system brought the children into the active<br/>\ncare of the school.  On the other hand,... well there<br/>\nis a LOT of on the other hand!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s Good 2 B Dog Nutz!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.good2bdognutz.com\">http://www.good2bdognutz.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

The<br/>\nteacher kept on telling me about how I needed to get her a tutor because she<br/>\nwasn&#39;t picking things up as quickly as she should. That was not my take on<br/>\nhow she was doing, although I knew she was not responding well to aspects of<br/>\nthe class that had nothing to do with learning the language (I&#39;ve sat in on<br/>\nthe class). But when I told the teacher that my daughter wouldn&#39;t be going<br/>\nto class anymore, the teacher told me, &quot;Oh, she was doing so well!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to a friend who is native-born Chinese about my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nexperience, and she said it was familiar to her from her experiences in<br/>\nChinese schools. She said: Chinese teachers like children and want them to<br/>\ndo well, so they are genuinely sad when a student does not continue in a<br/>\nclass. Chinese teachers will say a child &quot;isn&#39;t doing well&quot; when they are<br/>\nnot happy with something else about the child. Chinese teachers expect the<br/>\nchildren and the parents to make all the effort, to adapt to the teacher and<br/>\nthe system. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chinese class is very regimented: The children sit in order according to<br/>\ntheir birthdays and there are many lectures about how a good Chinese student<br/>\nacts. They do processions like my husband did in Catholic grade school in<br/>\nthe 1950s and early 1960s. We&#39;ve had some interesting values-based<br/>\ndiscussions about it in our family. I&#39;ve asked my son if Chinese class is<br/>\nsomething he wants to do (it frankly is sort of a pain to get him to the<br/>\nclass because of the time and location of it), and he&#39;s adamant that he<br/>\nwants to continue.
