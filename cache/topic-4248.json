I feel that there are elements of racism in the ways the<br/>\n&gt; schools in this town are dealing with certain kids.  Lancaster used to be<br/>\n&gt; kind of a hick town when my parents moved us there back when I was an 8th<br/>\n&gt; grader.  Over the years, it built up.  For a while, many residents were happy<br/>\n&gt; to see the subdivisions going in all over because it meant more jobs.  Also,<br/>\n&gt; they were happy to see restaurants and malls going in so that they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to go &quot;down below&quot; (local term for L.A.) for these things.<br/>\n&gt;     The housing was a lot cheaper than L.A. so that brought a lot of people.<br/>\n&gt; Then the economy started crashing.  They were very dependent on aerospace<br/>\n&gt; jobs so that was one big part of it.  Crime has increased a lot.  There are a<br/>\n&gt; lot more Mexican-Americans and African-Americans.  There are also more gangs.<br/>\n&gt;  Some of them are predominantly Mexican-American or African-American and<br/>\n&gt; there are also a lot of skinheads.  There are a lot of people in the town,<br/>\n&gt; particularly in the schools, who are very angry about this and have<br/>\n&gt; stereotyped every kid in baggy clothes as a gang member if he/she is Mexican<br/>\n&gt; American or African American.<br/>\n&gt;     My nephew is Mexican-American.  They think he&#39;s some kind of gang-banger,<br/>\n&gt; as they thought his sister was a few years back when she was in their school.<br/>\n&gt;  They don&#39;t have any basis for this.  I know quite well what the true gang<br/>\n&gt; style is and my nephew doesn&#39;t even dress that way.  He never goes out, goes<br/>\n&gt; to parties, or anything like that.  He stays home almost all the time.<br/>\n&gt;    I can&#39;t stand the way this town just throws away so many kids.  I watched<br/>\n&gt; it happen to my best friend&#39;s son, who is now 19.  He was an honor student up<br/>\n&gt; through 7th grade.  He found a knife one day at school and went straight to<br/>\n&gt; the office with it.  He turned it in on his own.  He still got in trouble for<br/>\n&gt; it.  My best friend, unlike my nephew&#39;s mom, is quite adept at arguing her<br/>\n&gt; case and did so.  She explained to them that it was absurd for him to be in<br/>\n&gt; trouble, that this would discourage him from going to the school authorities<br/>\n&gt; the next time around.  It was useless.<br/>\n&gt;    I feel like I want to fight against this and yet sometimes it seems like<br/>\n&gt; nothing changes anything.  I also do get frustrated with my cousin (his<br/>\n&gt; mother, but I consider the kids my nieces and nephews) because she can&#39;t seem<br/>\n&gt; to set aside her everyday all day trips to help him or the other kids.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; like he and the other kids have it bad from so many angles.<br/>\n&gt;     One side point I don&#39;t think I mentioned before.  I asked him where he<br/>\n&gt; got the idea of the finger across the throat, if that was a common gesture at<br/>\n&gt; his school or what.  He said no.  I said, &quot;Then how did you think of it?&quot;  He<br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;I don&#39;t know...they do it on wrestling...&quot;  These kids have watched<br/>\n&gt; wrestling for years because their dad loves it.  That even made me believe<br/>\n&gt; more strongly that he was certainly NOT thinking of that as some kind of<br/>\n&gt; death threat.<br/>\n&gt;     I get so sick of all the injustices.  Sometimes it seems like they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; everywhere and just once (or more) you want to actually be able to DO<br/>\n&gt; something instead of just rant and rave about it.
