The most structured thing any  of my <br/>\nkids has done so far was the junior police academy Marty attended when he  was <br/>\n14.  I told the organizers that he doesn&#39;t write very well, and please  to <br/>\ngive him a break on that.  On the videotape they made for the kids  afterwards, <br/>\none of the shots is of Marty taking notes, but I think the deal was  that <br/>\nMarty was popular with them there, and he was INTENTLY taking notes.   He brought <br/>\nthose notes home and re-wrote them, and still to this day could  probably tell <br/>\nyou the rules for safe handling of firearms.  (And btw to  this day he still <br/>\nhasn&#39;t actually handled a real firearm, though he&#39;s had  opportunities and he <br/>\nwas the best marksman of that week-long intensive  academy, with simulators <br/>\nand paintball guns.)<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Holly was doing acting and modelling classes, she was VERY into  <br/>\nfollowing the dress code and was miffed when others failed to do so.  She  studied <br/>\nher scripts HARD before class (partly because she wasn&#39;t reading yet,  and <br/>\npartly because she really liked the classes and wanted to do her  best).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe fact that unschoolers might choose to do a structured activity doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nchange the activity, but it can gradually and slightly (sometimes radically)  <br/>\nchange other parents involved, if the other parents aren&#39;t totally oblivious.  <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  I know that at the dojo where Kirby is still involved, the owner  backed <br/>\noff from the driving emphasis on school and grades, and it had to be  largely <br/>\nbecause of Kirby, who had neither and yet was the most dedicated of the  <br/>\nkid-students.<br/>\n <br/>\nA couple of times I&#39;ve photocopied the interview Emily Subler did with me  in <br/>\nHome Education Magazine years back.
