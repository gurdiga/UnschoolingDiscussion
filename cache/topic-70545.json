Wayne thought the movie was about a queer, a painter, that nasty Van Gough.  Not proper for a real man to portray.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it comes down to symbols to me.  Men have/had John Wayne as a symbol or model for &quot;a life well lived.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBringing it back to Unschooling, while trapped in a two storey brick encampment we call a P.School, image the symbols people (boys watching for their symbols, girls theirs) have presented to them.  Makes us well adjusted for prison and the military.  Do as your told - trust authority - move only when the bell rings.
