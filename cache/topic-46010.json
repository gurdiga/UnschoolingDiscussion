We have our own<br/>\n opinions. If I just disagree that calling a child specifically &quot;lazy&quot; is an<br/>\n okay thing, I am under no obligation to say it is &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Pam, except I didn&#39;t notice where Myranda said she ever called <br/>\nher son lazy,  with the exception of her post, which she apologized for <br/>\nsounding negative in.<br/>\nI do agree that it could come through to the child if we view them as &quot;lazy&quot; <br/>\nor any other number of labels.<br/>\nBut, I didn&#39;t read where she thought calling him lazy was acceptable AND she <br/>\nmentioned that they don&#39;t call him lazybones very often, just a term used in <br/>\nthe family.<br/>\nWe have terms like that.<br/>\nDh and I call each other &quot;goober&quot;.<br/>\nWe get some strange looks, but in our family it&#39;s equal to sweetie or honey.<br/>\n&quot;Hey goober, will you hand me that book?&quot;<br/>\nAnd we aren&#39;t really trying to call each other peanuts!! lol<br/>\nI think that names and labels can be very harmful, and the child can smile <br/>\nand laugh themselves right through some hurtful things. Happened to me. My <br/>\nDad brought home a button once that said &quot;second best, that&#39;s for me&quot; because <br/>\nthey always felt I was a bit &quot;lazy&quot; about schoolwork and such.<br/>\nIt hurt a little. Not too bad, because I was defiant and wore it anyway. But <br/>\nI then knew that my Dad saw me that way, and it bothered me, even though it <br/>\nwas just a joke.<br/>\nSo it&#39;s good to examine the &quot;fun&quot; things in our own families and make sure we <br/>\naren&#39;t acting from only our point of view, but thinking of how the other <br/>\nperson may be taking it.<br/>\nJared got really upset over his nickname &quot;Science&quot;.<br/>\nYep, they nicknamed him science guy because he was smart and curious about <br/>\nscientific type stuff. It bugged the heck out of him. I had to get very mean <br/>\nwith dh and bil over it because they thought it was SO funny. And they <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand why it bugged him because they were paying a compliment <br/>\nin their minds.<br/>\nBut he hated it, and that&#39;s really all that mattered.<br/>\nThey finally let up when I got mad.<br/>\nAnd I tried to help Jared find ways to stand up for himself. Men can be such <br/>\ndunderheads sometimes (not the ones here...just in our family, lol)<br/>\nAnd sometimes Trevor will tell me I&#39;m being a doofbean when I am being <br/>\nforgetfull. Said with fun and lightheartedness it doesn&#39;t bother anyone that <br/>\nI can tell.<br/>\nAnd they aren&#39;t afraid to tell me if it does.<br/>\nSo doofbean or goober are ok with everyone, but don&#39;t dare say &quot;science&quot;!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45996,"nextTopicId":45603}}
