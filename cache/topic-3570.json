I am against the principles that Ezzo work from, as I don&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve that we should have unquestioning obedience to any higher power, and<br/>\nI am against anyone who advises methods of controlling children which do not<br/>\ntake their feelings and thoughts into consideration.  Now, I have to admit<br/>\nthat I talk the talk better than I walk the walk where loving guidance is<br/>\nconcerned, but I do my darndest to let my children know that they have<br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother point to this is that of the sort of people we are trying to raise<br/>\nhere.  Primitive tribes have been studied by antrhopologists and others, and<br/>\nwhile there are many differences, some things are common to varios peoples,<br/>\nwith similar outcomes.  Basically the &#39;successful&#39; warrior tribes have less<br/>\nphysical contact with their babies than more peaceful tribes.  The children<br/>\nwho are raised by &#39;attachment parenting&#39; style methods tend to grow into<br/>\ngroups of people who are happy and comfortable around each other (allowing<br/>\nfor personality, of course), the children who are raised in separation mode,<br/>\nbabies only picked up for feeding and tied to a board for travelling, as<br/>\noppose to a sling, tend to share mistrust of others, among other personality<br/>\ntraits, even within their own clans.  This is not conclusive, of course, and<br/>\nI&#39;m not entirely sure where I read it, even, but nevertheless, I think hard<br/>\nabout what kind of children I want to raise when I decide how to deal with<br/>\nthem.  And I don&#39;t want &#39;Stepford&#39; children, instantly obedient, bent to my<br/>\nwill, however easy it would make my life now, because I don&#39;t want them<br/>\ndependent totally on others their whole life.<br/>\n<br/>\nJMNSHO<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and PS...  A baby can give cues to whether he/she would appreciate<br/>\nfeeding round about now, LONG before they get around to crying!  Crying is a<br/>\ndevice to tell you something is wrong.  If a baby is crying for food, then<br/>\nhe&#39;s had to wait too long for it!  The recommended feeding schedule has been<br/>\nchanged since the increase in &#39;failure-to-thrive&#39; babies from 4hrs to 2&1/2<br/>\nto 3 hours.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re adaptive to your child, and have enough sense<br/>\nto read when the &#39;schedule&#39; isn&#39;t working.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"faith buckley","from":"faith buckley &lt;faithb@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MNuR5t047H3LI2viKgBbTHPxEHoGgWlLsMUATfl0wyj2haEK1ocah9j6EBjh4DBXi_8pXUyB0sYdAjmHeeuM6pVANOJkIQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"&quot;Glad I&#39;m not....&quot;","postDate":"939084184","msgId":3570,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNDAuMzU3MC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3638,"prevInTime":3569,"nextInTime":3571,"topicId":3570,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone wrote in saying that sometimes they are glad they aren t a Christian because of this whole Ezzo thing and being associated with them.
