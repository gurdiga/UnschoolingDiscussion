I think my husband confuses obedience with<br/>\n respect. Just because the kids don&#39;t immediately obey, my husband gets upset<br/>\n because they don&#39;t respect me. I feel they do respect me, just don&#39;t always<br/>\n obey. So, how does one show respect? Is disobedience always a sign of<br/>\n disrespect? I mean the kids do obey, just not right away. I think we have a<br/>\n great amount of respect for one another, but don&#39;t want to be fooling<br/>\n myself. I love the various opinions and advice from all of you and thank you<br/>\n for your help in advance. :)<br/>\n <br/>\n ~Sheri &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   Does your dh like to read? :o)  Kids Are Worth It by Barbara Coloroso<br/>\n<br/>\n   Do we really want our children to &quot;obey&quot; us? Or do we want a working <br/>\nrelationship w/ respect. I try to think before I ask,tel,demand,whatever of <br/>\nmy dd.....would I speak this way if she were a friend or a stranger? <br/>\n<br/>\n   I (being short a fuse today) snapped at dd to quit hitting the roof <br/>\ninterior w/ her stick. If it were a friend of mine doing the same thing how <br/>\nwould I have acted? I would have said &quot;hey Ginger could you please stop using <br/>\nthe stick in my car?&quot; Something like that. If we treat our children w/ <br/>\nrespect they in turn(eventually) will treat us w/ respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24201,"nextTopicId":24206}}
