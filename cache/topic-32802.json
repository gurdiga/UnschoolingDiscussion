I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>\nhow a child would learn grammar on their own.  <br/>\nI sent a post asking and had about 3 mistakes in the<br/>\nsentence. LOL  I was corrected to , but I thought it<br/>\nwas all in good humor.  I think people forget to type<br/>\nLOL or other little notation they use to show it is in<br/>\ngood humor.  When I type I do not alway have my<br/>\nsentence grammatically correct. Geez I have fragments<br/>\nrunons and what else you can get wrong.  When I am in<br/>\ngroups or chats I type the sometimes the way I talk. <br/>\nSometimes I think faster than my fingers can keep up<br/>\nwith. Don&#39;t leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nLilly<br/>\nPS your not old and crochety!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
