You don&#39;t need to do anything to<br/>\nthe tree itself. It already knows how to be and grow into a tree. All it<br/>\nneeds is the environment to do what it know hows to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo unschooling is akin to making sure the tree has access to what that<br/>\nparticular tree needs in order to be that particular tree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Alas one year <br/>\n&gt; of unschooling was frustrating for me because my children did very<br/>\n&gt; little but listen ot tapes, read so so books and argue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Get out and do things. Don&#39;t worry about educational. Do things you think<br/>\nyou&#39;d all enjoy. Have a picnic. Explore a place you&#39;ve never been to. Eat at<br/>\nan ethnic restaurant.<br/>\n<br/>\n(But let them do home things too! Watch TV. Play video games. Bake cookies.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf *you* aren&#39;t learning for pure enjoyment, is it reasonable to expect that<br/>\nthey will? If your purpose of doing a project is to inspire them to do the<br/>\nproject, you&#39;re going to be disappointed. Do things *you* want to do without<br/>\nthe agenda. Go places you want to that you think they might enjoy<br/>\naccompanying you. Offer to take them places to further their own interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you come across something that connects with an interest they have or<br/>\nthat you think is cool and fun to play with bring it home and leave it<br/>\nlaying around.<br/>\n<br/>\nFoster in *yourself* a need to explore, to notice the coolness in things, to<br/>\nbe curious. Do this *for yourself* not as a method to get the kids to be<br/>\nmore the way you&#39;d like them to be. (If you aren&#39;t honestly and sincerely<br/>\ncurious about life and exploring for yourself, then it isn&#39;t fair to expect<br/>\nthem to be.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and argue.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A book that many people have found very helpful is Siblings Without Rivarly<br/>\nby Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380799006/qid=984825970/sr=1-1/ref=s<br/>\nc_b_2/102-3006399-8134511<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a *very* easy read with cartoon and dialog standard scenarios that<br/>\nwe&#39;ve all experienced and how the standard response leads down the path<br/>\nwe&#39;re trying to avoid and a number of ways to approach it differently.
