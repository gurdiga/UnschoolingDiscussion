They unfairly called this <br/>\n&quot;Sandra Dodd Cheats on Tests.&quot; I never did! I&#39;m simply and subversively <br/>\nrecommending that in the absence of the opportunity to avoid them altogether, <br/>\nthe second best option might be invalidating them. (The paragraph beneath <br/>\nappeared in the newsletter too; I&#39;ve added links but not text to it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUNSCHOOLING.COM <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the topic of testing: I have a very serious suggestion which will seem <br/>\nlike a joke, but I&#39;m absolutely soberly recommending this: <br/>\n<br/>\nCheat. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t cheat to get a better score or a worse score. Just invalidate the test <br/>\neither by taking too long, or making a pattern with all the answer marks in <br/>\nodd-numbered sections, or using dice to decide anything for which the answer <br/>\nisn&#39;t absolutely obvious to the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parent and child both know in advance that the scores could not <br/>\nPOSSIBLY actually begin to attempt to reflect the child&#39;s &quot;actual&quot; knowledge <br/>\nor intelligence or aptitude or value, then that number will lose its juju and <br/>\nits ability to harm the child-parent relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf all the things I believe strongly, one which has changed my life as <br/>\nprofoundly as any one other belief is my personal knowledge that test scores <br/>\ncan and do (can&#39;t fail to) affect the treatment a child receives at his <br/>\nparents&#39; hands. High scores, low scores, average scores--no matter. Parents <br/>\ncease to treat the child as his original, known self and color him soul deep <br/>\nwith that number. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy life would have been different. My husband&#39;s life would have been <br/>\ndifferent, without those 5th and 8th grade ITBS scores. I venture to say <br/>\nwithout even knowing who is reading this that your life would have been <br/>\ndifferent, and specifically I believe your life would have been better, had <br/>\nnot you been branded with a number on your &quot;permanent record&quot; (there&#39;s a big <br/>\nmean scary joke, the &quot;permanence&quot; and important parts) as a young innocent <br/>\nten or thirteen year old full of potential, at some unknown point on a <br/>\nlearning curve which might soon be at its settled-out point, or might just be <br/>\nbeginning. <br/>\n                     ~~~ Sandra Dodd <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling.com offers a free monthly newsletter , message boards , <br/>\nweekly essays , an email list and more just for unschoolers.
