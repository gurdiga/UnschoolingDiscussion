I&#39;m not trying to pick fights with<br/>\nanyone or drag anyone down. As Melissa said, this is supposed to be<br/>\nsupportive to all unschoolers. We can disagree and live.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my last remark on spanking (promise)(well, for now anyway)....All I<br/>\ncan figure is some people can&#39;t distinguish between a single swat on the<br/>\nbehind (that only stings for a second and doesn&#39;t leave a mark) and a<br/>\nwhipping, thrashing, or beating. I&#39;m sorry that people have been so abused<br/>\nthat any kind of spanking constitutes violence to them. I mean that....I&#39;m<br/>\nvery sad for their suffering. But that does not make the kind of spanking I<br/>\nam talking about abusive. If it turns their stomach, by all means, they<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t spank. The same doesn&#39;t hold true for me since we are different<br/>\npeople with different children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe logic of comparing an adult paddling another adult or &quot;would you want<br/>\nyour husband to do that to you?&quot; or &quot;if it isn&#39;t okay in public, why is it<br/>\nokay in your home&quot; also doesn&#39;t work for me. The family unit is unique.<br/>\nChildren are not adults. I am not my husband&#39;s child to bring up. We treat<br/>\neach other like a married couple.  It wouldn&#39;t be appropriate to do many<br/>\nthings in a grocery store....change a diaper for instance. Have an intimate<br/>\nconversation. Make love. That doesn&#39;t make those things wrong...they just<br/>\nneed privacy. It also wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for another adult outside our<br/>\nfamily to do many things that we do in our home. I wouldn&#39;t want someone<br/>\nother than my husband to walk up and give me a passionate kiss (okay, unless<br/>\nit was Sean Connery). I wouldn&#39;t anyone else to breastfeed my babies. And I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want anyone else to spank my children...and I don&#39;t spank others&#39;<br/>\nkids either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a comment once that spanking a bare bottom was sexual abuse. I think<br/>\nthat is insulting to anyone who&#39;s really suffered sexual abuse. I wonder<br/>\nwhat that person thinks of wiping a poopy bottom? It&#39;s certainly more<br/>\nintimate. These things are just taken too far. Real abuse is criminal. It<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be muddled and trivialized by lumping ordinary spanking in with<br/>\nit. I hope I am being more understandable this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n----Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12628,"nextTopicId":12635}}
