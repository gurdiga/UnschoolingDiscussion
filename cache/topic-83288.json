I look at an addiction as something someone does repeatedly that is <br/>\nharmful to themselves, such as drugs, over eating, etc.  I read every day, is <br/>\nthat an addiction?  Absolutely  not.  Sometimes I enjoy a book so much that I <br/>\nwill read until I am finished, do nothing else except the <br/>\nnecessaries-bathroom, eating, etc.  Still, not an addiction.  A choice; there&#39;s a difference.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thank you for saying &quot;screw wellroundedness&quot;!!!  I feel the same way.  <br/>\nWhy should I know the price in China when (a) I&#39;m never going there and (b) <br/>\ndon&#39;t eat it anyway.  And there are many other reasons not to know the price of <br/>\nrice in China.  There are many things I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t feel less of a <br/>\nperson for not filling myself up with a bunch of information that I will <br/>\neventually forget and never use anyway.  What I do know, I know well, and what I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know, well, I have the internet and the library for that IF I actually want <br/>\nto learn it!<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I getting the hang of this unschooling or what??<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"intense focus","postDate":"1067266215","msgId":83288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjNi4xMGVhYTljMS4yY2NlOGFhN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":83293,"prevInTime":83287,"nextInTime":83289,"topicId":83288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... unless they somehow got the idea from someone else that they shouldn t be spending so much time on that activity or that that activity is somehow a ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-534382901\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can&#39;t understand why a child would claim to be addicted to something,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>unless they somehow got the idea from someone else that they shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nspending so much time on that activity or that that activity is somehow a<br/>\nnegative thing.

I believe whole-heartedly that intense focus is <br/>\na GOOD thing. And that they can come and go, wax and wane. Addictions aren&#39;t <br/>\nlike that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy focal points have changed over the years---at different points in my life, <br/>\nI&#39;ve been EXTREMELY focused on dogs: their breeding, training, grooming, <br/>\nshowing, judging. Horses: their training, handling, grooming, racing, tack, and <br/>\nshowing. Travel. Food, parties, and entertaining. Remodeling and decorating old <br/>\nhouses. Gardening. Ancient civilizations and sociology. Astronomy.  And land <br/>\nsearching. And beekeeping and alpacas. Unschooling is my main focus now---and I <br/>\nhad to throw myself into conferences for a while. Occasionally to the <br/>\ndetriment of other, more minor, things.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus is HARD for many people. And I think that maybe THEY see focus as an <br/>\naddiction. Could that be possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nBen&#39;s  most recent issue of The Wine Spectator had a full page ad with a hand <br/>\nholding a trout. Underneath was this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;He never learned to fly-fish. Or play a trombone. Or waterski. Or learn <br/>\nGerman.
