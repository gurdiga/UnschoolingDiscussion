They say they believe in Santa, <br/>\nthey tell everyone that they believe in Santa.  Santa comes they have fun.  <br/>\nThey get their picture taken with Santa every year together and apart from a <br/>\ncouple of uncomfortable years when the boys were middle teen agers they enjoy <br/>\nit.  It&#39;s something they look forward too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they say to me there is no Santa, there is no Easter Bunny, stop this <br/>\nnonsense, I don&#39;t believe in it.  I will stop it.  They enjoy it, they look <br/>\nforward to it, it&#39;s a family event.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck my 23 year old even tried to spend the night and put her wisdom teeth <br/>\nunder her pillow for the tooth fairy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLife as an adult can be boring sometimes.  Especially those in between years <br/>\nwhen you feel like you should act all grown up but no children of your own to <br/>\nspend the holidays with so if mine want to be indulged a little longer or <br/>\nforever really, it&#39;s not a problem for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an adventure.  We have LOTS of traditions that we do in the winter <br/>\nleading up to Christmas.  Lots of adult things too, like picking a family <br/>\nfrom the angel tree and shopping for them.  Doing the 12 days of Christmas <br/>\nfor a family we all select.  (if you don&#39;t know what that is, I can explain <br/>\nit but it&#39;s kinda involved but great to do as a family).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a fat man in a furry red suit?  They see him every year, so of course <br/>\nthere is a Santa.  Is this man at the mall the TRUE Santa?  Of course not, <br/>\nhe&#39;s the earth science teacher at the middle school, he wears flippers on his <br/>\nfeet instead of boots, he can&#39;t be the REAL Santa.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe REAL Santa is in your heart where you can carry him for as long as you <br/>\nwant.  It&#39;s the magical spirit of make believe that somehow comes true.

The kids she went to school with that it was<br/>\nhysterical. Needless to say she was disappointed when she found out<br/>\notherwise.

He loved the Santa<br/>\nstory. So when Joseph was old enough to ask, I pretty much left it up to my<br/>\nhusband. And when Joseph got older yet and asked me, I would ask him what he<br/>\nthought. It&#39;s worked that way ever since. Kids are 8,7 and 2. I think they<br/>\nstill believe in Santa and we do have a gift or two from him at Christmas.<br/>\nThe kids won&#39;t go to see him though or put out cookies or anything.
