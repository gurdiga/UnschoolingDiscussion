Their <br/>\nhistory shows (most significantly in the work of AIDs) that they at times <br/>\nhave little say over what is given priority, and politics plays a strong hand <br/>\nin that. I certainly would never trash CDC completely. I believe their work <br/>\nis invaluable, but temper it with the knowledge that they are just people. <br/>\nMuch the same way I feel about the FBI and other governmental bueracracies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Regarding the homeopathic approach of giving a child camomilla??? I agree<br/>\n&gt; with your warning about following that plan...

Where did you get that information? Let&#39;s not forget <br/>\nthat many things are carcinogenic used inappropiately or incorrectly, <br/>\nincluding the petrol derivative that aspirin is made from, and ordinary black <br/>\ntea.<br/>\nAnyone that would give that<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in any substantive dose to a child is misinformed!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, my problem was with the bovine colustrum, as I am a vegetarian.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t seem to be familiar with the principle of homeopathy. Firstly, <br/>\nchamomilla is the botanical name for Chamomile. Secondly, the principles of <br/>\nhomeopathy are such that one never receives a substantial dose of ANYTHING. <br/>\nFrom Dana Ulman, MPH, Homeopathy, A-Z:<br/>\nHomeopathic medicines are made from various plants, minerals, animals, or <br/>\nchemical. Ultimately, every substance on the planet  is a potential medicine, <br/>\nand that&#39;s because every substance on the planet is also potentially toxic.<br/>\nThe way that homeopaths reduce the potential for toxicity and actually <br/>\nincrease the potential for healing is through a specific pharmaceutical <br/>\nprocess that is unique to homepathy call potentization. Potentization refers <br/>\nto a process of sequential dilution with vigorous shaking in between each <br/>\ndilution.<br/>\nMore specifically, the tincture of a plant may be diluted in double distilled <br/>\nwater (usually in a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution). This mixture is vigorously <br/>\nshaken then diluted again 1:10 or 1:100. This process is diluted 3, 6, 12, <br/>\n30, 200, 1000, 10,000, 50,000 or more times.<br/>\nWhen a substance is diluted 1:10 six times it is called &quot;6X&quot; potency. When a <br/>\nsubstance is diluted 1:100 six times, it is called a 6C potency.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23119,"nextTopicId":23128}}
