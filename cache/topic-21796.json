I don&#39;t think that is exactly what God intended. I have known too many women who were abused and didn&#39;t get help because they had to obey their husbands and the church turned their back on them. The other side of this scripture says a husband is to love his wife as the Lord loved the church and gave himself up for her. Most abusers totally omit this half of the scripture. I obey my husband, but my husband is not abusive. He on the other hand will listen to me when I don&#39;t agree and sometimes changes his mind.

Miss <br/>\nFinley bolsters the thought in the reader’s mind that the child should <br/>\ndecide. Now, if an unbelieving parent is commanding a child to commit <br/>\nadultery, murder, incest, or some other serious ill, a child might know to do <br/>\nright. However, in laying down the fine points of Christian practice, young <br/>\nchildren are not likely to be doctrinal experts. In these matters, if the <br/>\nBible teaches women to listen and be under the authority of their <br/>\nhusbands. Certainly children should follow suit. If women are easily <br/>\ndeceiveF䅃䔽≇敮敶愢⁆䅍䥌夽十乓卅剉䘾-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n(That&#39;s the reviewer, about an incident in which Elsie refused to read <br/>\nsecular texts to her dying non-Christian father on the Sabbath; reviewer <br/>\nseems I guess to think she should have, since it was her father.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the insult about women being easily decieved is extra interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-There is a danger for children to have such an independent spirit <br/>\nconcerning spiritual matters. For instance, suppose the parents are against <br/>\nChristian rock music, but the children see nothing wrong with it, and <br/>\ntherefore, according to Elsie, can follow their own spiritual convictions <br/>\nconcerning music. However, it is presumable that eight-year-old children are <br/>\nnot likely to be wiser than their parents in these matters.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess reading Elsie Dinsmore can speak over the years (in her newly edited <br/>\nvoice) to cause children to want Christian rock music.  I guess it&#39;s more <br/>\nabominable than anyone ever thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-There is also a terrible reference to the &quot;rod&quot; on page 94 of book two. It <br/>\nis considered an ignominious and revolting punishment. Also, as we can see, <br/>\nif Elsie had been biblically reprimanded for her disobedience, an <br/>\neight-year-old’s continuing battle of wills with her father would not have <br/>\ndeveloped into a melodrama spanning two entire books, and which the author <br/>\nChristianizes by culminating it with a confession of faith on the father’s <br/>\npart.

Since no one in my family ever<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  threw out a book, I&#39;d read several a good fifty years after they&#39;d gone<br/>\n  out<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  of print.  Curiosity piqued, I went to the Net to find 2,110 entries for<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Elsie. I discovered, to my horror, that Elsie is being pushed by<br/>\n  Christian<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Fundamentalists as achild,<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  exemplifies the idea that character counts in the face of tribulation.<br/>\n  The<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  books accurately picture 19th century life.&quot;  It turns out that the<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Fundamentalist press has even reprinted the first four Elsie books. The<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  first is now titled Elsie, the Endless Wait  (this is when she is<br/>\n  pilloried<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  by her cousins while longing for her absent father). There is even a line<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  of Elsie dolls illustrating pertinent moments in the stories.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  A bit of literary background: The Elsie Dinsmore series, written by<br/>\n  Martha<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Finlay) was quite possibly the first set of &quot;girls&quot; books. The Dodd<br/>\n  Company<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  (before Meade came along) published the first story in 1868. This<br/>\n  antedates<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  even Little Women though Louisa was a far better writer. In their day,<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  which lasted about fifty years, Elsie sold hugely. There were eventually<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  perhaps twenty five or thirty books and the story was  terminated only<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  because Finlay died.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Despite the fact that I dote on Elsie, I am horrified that defenseless<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Christian children are being assigned this book  because---for those of<br/>\n  you<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  that are not Elsie fans---Elsie is NOT Nancy Drew in a hoopskirt . A<br/>\n  brief<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  summary:<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Elsie is a Southern heiress who came to be because her father and mother<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  fell in love and eloped when he was seventeen and she was fifteen.<br/>\n  Elsie&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  mother died in childbirth at 16. Her father Horace, horrified, took off<br/>\n  for<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Europe leaving Elsie to be raised by Mrs. Murray, a Scotch-Presyterian<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  housekeeper and Chloe, Elsie&#39;s beloved black Mammie, who adores all white<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  folk but particularly adores Elsie. When Mrs. Murray kicks the bucket,<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Elsie is sent to live with her paternal Grandfather and his second wife,<br/>\n  a<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  social climber with a passel of awful children, most notably Enna, who<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  abuses Elsie daily. The story opens as Horace arrives home from Europe<br/>\n  when<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Elsie is eight. He cannot stand the sight of her, because she looks<br/>\n  exactly<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  like his dead wife, and he cannot stand listening to her either, because<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  she is a devout Christian who won&#39;t play secular songs on Sunday or wear<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  new clothes to church because they would take her mind off worship in<br/>\n  God&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  house. Elsie falls off piano benches, passes into brain fever and suffers<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  other horrors too numerous to mention until such a time as she convinces<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  her father to be saved too. Now mind you, all of the above is not a world<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  that I embrace but although narrowly righteous, it&#39;s not  deviant. What<br/>\n  IS<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  horrifying about the assignment of these books to unknowing children is<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  that the following elements ALSO figure in Elsie&#39;s perennial saga:<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  1. Elsie owns three hundred slaves in her own name and, in book four,<br/>\n  buys<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  several more. She always calls them &quot;my people&quot; as in,&quot; my possessions.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  2. All the black people in the book (with the exception of Chloe&#39;s<br/>\n  &quot;unruly<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  buck husband&quot; who is sold away from her) love the Massa and give thanks<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  practically daily for their servitude. Chloe&#39;s husband, in his old age,<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  sees the light of God and becomes a willing slave once more.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  3. Elsie&#39;s relationship with her father is most peculiar, involving as it<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  does many mouth-to-mouth kisses and caresses. She strokes him regularly<br/>\n  and<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  speaks of her adoration. He returns it. Every day she sits on his lap as<br/>\n  he<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  instructs her. This goes on until she is fifteen or so. She does nothing<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  without his permission, because to obey one&#39;s parents is absolute filial<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  duty,  even unto her 25th year. <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  4. After a brief interlude with a fortune hunter in Book 3 (a man that<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Horace quickly dispatches to the state pen), Elsie marries her father&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  best friend, who is 20 years older than she is and whom she has known<br/>\n  since<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  she was eight.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  It is for reasons 3 and 4 that I, while in high school, wrote an essay<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  called &quot;Elsie Dinsmore Meets Sigmund Freud.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  5. Elsie is not an inclusive Christian. In books one and two she is<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  threatened with convent school. She knows this is the end for her because<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  what the priests and nuns do in those places is unspeakable. Mrs. Murray,<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  her old housekeeper, told her all about it. At the very least she will be<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  locked away and tortured until she converts. Papists are condemned in<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  several of the following books too.<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  6. Anti-semitism crops up in Book 5, &quot;Elsie&#39;s Children.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  7. The KKK is a force for good, Cousin Enna becomes a Confederate spy and<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  the Dinsmore darkies (all of whom speak perfect Jim Crow and Zip Coon)<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  resist freedom, lingering into the 1890&#39;s as &quot;servants&quot; whose wages are<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  never mentioned. <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  8.Not to misrepresent things: Elsie is a model slaveowner. She forbids<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  flogging, substituting loss of privileges and imprisonment on bread and<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  water as punishments for failure to work. She lectures her New England<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  overseer about how one must allow for the indolent nature of the black<br/>\n  folk<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  and arranges the services of a chaplain for &quot;her people.&quot; Her children<br/>\n  are<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  unfailingly thoughtful to their slave playmates, teaching them that when<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  they go to heaven, they will turn white like their masters.  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  9. Did I mention that Elsie, besides being a bigot, is an insufferable<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  prig?  She  suffers nervous prostrations and is given to dialogue like,<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  &quot;Are you vexed with me, Papa?&quot; Following this line,  she frequently<br/>\n  kneels<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  at his feet.  Later, when she is a woman, Elsie says &quot;Unhand me this<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  instant, sir!&quot; and the like.  Naturally, she is utterly beautiful and<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  worshipped by all. <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  I love Elsie---the way I love to study poisonous reptiles. As a role<br/>\n  model<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  OR as history OR as as example of good English composition, Elsie is a<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  disaster. That she is now being touted as a Christian example to<br/>\n  malleable<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  children indicates what the Fundamentalist Right may be all about, a<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  strange world of racial privilege, religious intolerance and child<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  marriage. <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  Our current president is supported by the religious right who consider<br/>\n  him<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;  one of their own. I worry. sk<br/>\n  &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _______________________________________________________<br/>\n  Send a cool gift with your E-Card<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/\">http://www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I<br/>\n<br/>\n  immediately bought all that weren&#39;t duplicates to mine even though I paid<br/>\n<br/>\n  $1. apiece for the last ones I laid hands on (in Washburn, Wisconsin 15<br/>\n<br/>\n  years ago) and these had escalated to $14.   &quot;You were lucky to get so<br/>\n<br/>\n  many,&quot; the bookstore owner said. &quot; These just came in. They are very<br/>\n<br/>\n  popular. They just fly off the shelves once I put them on my mailing<br/>\n<br/>\n  lists.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was amazed since, for many years, I was the only person I knew who was<br/>\n<br/>\n  intimately acquainted with Elsie---or even acquainted at all. My<br/>\n<br/>\n  grandmother, a huge fan in her youth (we are now back to around 1906)  had<br/>\n<br/>\n  read every single Elsie book as a child. Since no one in my family ever<br/>\n<br/>\n  threw out a book, I&#39;d read several a good fifty years after they&#39;d gone out<br/>\n<br/>\n  of print.  Curiosity piqued, I went to the Net to find 2,110 entries for<br/>\n<br/>\n  Elsie. I discovered, to my horror, that Elsie is being pushed by Christian<br/>\n<br/>\n  Fundamentalists as achild,<br/>\n<br/>\n  exemplifies the idea that character counts in the face of tribulation. The<br/>\n<br/>\n  books accurately picture 19th century life.&quot;  It turns out that the<br/>\n<br/>\n  Fundamentalist press has even reprinted the first four Elsie books. The<br/>\n<br/>\n  first is now titled Elsie, the Endless Wait  (this is when she is pilloried<br/>\n<br/>\n  by her cousins while longing for her absent father). There is even a line<br/>\n<br/>\n  of Elsie dolls illustrating pertinent moments in the stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  A bit of literary background: The Elsie Dinsmore series, written by Martha<br/>\n<br/>\n  Finlay) was quite possibly the first set of &quot;girls&quot; books. The Dodd Company<br/>\n<br/>\n  (before Meade came along) published the first story in 1868. This antedates<br/>\n<br/>\n  even Little Women though Louisa was a far better writer. In their day,<br/>\n<br/>\n  which lasted about fifty years, Elsie sold hugely. There were eventually<br/>\n<br/>\n  perhaps twenty five or thirty books and the story was  terminated only<br/>\n<br/>\n  because Finlay died.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Despite the fact that I dote on Elsie, I am horrified that defenseless<br/>\n<br/>\n  Christian children are being assigned this book  because---for those of you<br/>\n<br/>\n  that are not Elsie fans---Elsie is NOT Nancy Drew in a hoopskirt . A brief<br/>\n<br/>\n  summary:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Elsie is a Southern heiress who came to be because her father and mother<br/>\n<br/>\n  fell in love and eloped when he was seventeen and she was fifteen. Elsie&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n  mother died in childbirth at 16. Her father Horace, horrified, took off for<br/>\n<br/>\n  Europe leaving Elsie to be raised by Mrs. Murray, a Scotch-Presyterian<br/>\n<br/>\n  housekeeper and Chloe, Elsie&#39;s beloved black Mammie, who adores all white<br/>\n<br/>\n  folk but particularly adores Elsie. When Mrs. Murray kicks the bucket,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Elsie is sent to live with her paternal Grandfather and his second wife, a<br/>\n<br/>\n  social climber with a passel of awful children, most notably Enna, who<br/>\n<br/>\n  abuses Elsie daily. The story opens as Horace arrives home from Europe when<br/>\n<br/>\n  Elsie is eight. He cannot stand the sight of her, because she looks exactly<br/>\n<br/>\n  like his dead wife, and he cannot stand listening to her either, because<br/>\n<br/>\n  she is a devout Christian who won&#39;t play secular songs on Sunday or wear<br/>\n<br/>\n  new clothes to church because they would take her mind off worship in God&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n  house. Elsie falls off piano benches, passes into brain fever and suffers<br/>\n<br/>\n  other horrors too numerous to mention until such a time as she convinces<br/>\n<br/>\n  her father to be saved too. Now mind you, all of the above is not a world<br/>\n<br/>\n  that I embrace but although narrowly righteous, it&#39;s not  deviant. What IS<br/>\n<br/>\n  horrifying about the assignment of these books to unknowing children is<br/>\n<br/>\n  that the following elements ALSO figure in Elsie&#39;s perennial saga:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  1. Elsie owns three hundred slaves in her own name and, in book four, buys<br/>\n<br/>\n  several more. She always calls them &quot;my people&quot; as in,&quot; my possessions.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  2. All the black people in the book (with the exception of Chloe&#39;s &quot;unruly<br/>\n<br/>\n  buck husband&quot; who is sold away from her) love the Massa and give thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n  practically daily for their servitude. Chloe&#39;s husband, in his old age,<br/>\n<br/>\n  sees the light of God and becomes a willing slave once more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  3. Elsie&#39;s relationship with her father is most peculiar, involving as it<br/>\n<br/>\n  does many mouth-to-mouth kisses and caresses. She strokes him regularly and<br/>\n<br/>\n  speaks of her adoration. He returns it. Every day she sits on his lap as he<br/>\n<br/>\n  instructs her. This goes on until she is fifteen or so. She does nothing<br/>\n<br/>\n  without his permission, because to obey one&#39;s parents is absolute filial<br/>\n<br/>\n  duty,  even unto her 25th year. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  4. After a brief interlude with a fortune hunter in Book 3 (a man that<br/>\n<br/>\n  Horace quickly dispatches to the state pen), Elsie marries her father&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n  best friend, who is 20 years older than she is and whom she has known since<br/>\n<br/>\n  she was eight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is for reasons 3 and 4 that I, while in high school, wrote an essay<br/>\n<br/>\n  called &quot;Elsie Dinsmore Meets Sigmund Freud.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  5. Elsie is not an inclusive Christian. In books one and two she is<br/>\n<br/>\n  threatened with convent school. She knows this is the end for her because<br/>\n<br/>\n  what the priests and nuns do in those places is unspeakable. Mrs. Murray,<br/>\n<br/>\n  her old housekeeper, told her all about it. At the very least she will be<br/>\n<br/>\n  locked away and tortured until she converts. Papists are condemned in<br/>\n<br/>\n  several of the following books too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  6. Anti-semitism crops up in Book 5, &quot;Elsie&#39;s Children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  7. The KKK is a force for good, Cousin Enna becomes a Confederate spy and<br/>\n<br/>\n  the Dinsmore darkies (all of whom speak perfect Jim Crow and Zip Coon)<br/>\n<br/>\n  resist freedom, lingering into the 1890&#39;s as &quot;servants&quot; whose wages are<br/>\n<br/>\n  never mentioned. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  8.Not to misrepresent things: Elsie is a model slaveowner. She forbids<br/>\n<br/>\n  flogging, substituting loss of privileges and imprisonment on bread and<br/>\n<br/>\n  water as punishments for failure to work. She lectures her New England<br/>\n<br/>\n  overseer about how one must allow for the indolent nature of the black folk<br/>\n<br/>\n  and arranges the services of a chaplain for &quot;her people.&quot; Her children are<br/>\n<br/>\n  unfailingly thoughtful to their slave playmates, teaching them that when<br/>\n<br/>\n  they go to heaven, they will turn white like their masters.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  9. Did I mention that Elsie, besides being a bigot, is an insufferable<br/>\n<br/>\n  prig?  She  suffers nervous prostrations and is given to dialogue like,<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Are you vexed with me, Papa?&quot; Following this line,  she frequently kneels<br/>\n<br/>\n  at his feet.  Later, when she is a woman, Elsie says &quot;Unhand me this<br/>\n<br/>\n  instant, sir!&quot; and the like.  Naturally, she is utterly beautiful and<br/>\n<br/>\n  worshipped by all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love Elsie---the way I love to study poisonous reptiles. As a role model<br/>\n<br/>\n  OR as history OR as as example of good English composition, Elsie is a<br/>\n<br/>\n  disaster. That she is now being touted as a Christian example to malleable<br/>\n<br/>\n  children indicates what the Fundamentalist Right may be all about, a<br/>\n<br/>\n  strange world of racial privilege, religious intolerance and child<br/>\n<br/>\n  marriage. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our current president is supported by the religious right who consider him<br/>\n<br/>\n  one of their own. I worry. sk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Mrs. Murray,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  her old housekeeper, told her all about it. At the very least she will be<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  locked away and tortured until she converts. Papists are condemned in<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  several of the following books too.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  6. Anti-semitism crops up in Book 5, &quot;Elsie&#39;s Children.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  7. The KKK is a force for good, Cousin Enna becomes a Confederate spy and<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  the Dinsmore darkies (all of whom speak perfect Jim Crow and Zip Coon)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  resist freedom, lingering into the 1890&#39;s as &quot;servants&quot; whose wages are<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  never mentioned. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  8.Not to misrepresent things: Elsie is a model slaveowner. She forbids<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  flogging, substituting loss of privileges and imprisonment on bread and<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  water as punishments for failure to work. She lectures her New England<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  overseer about how one must allow for the indolent nature of the black<br/>\nfolk<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  and arranges the services of a chaplain for &quot;her people.&quot; Her children<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  unfailingly thoughtful to their slave playmates, teaching them that when<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  they go to heaven, they will turn white like their masters.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  9. Did I mention that Elsie, besides being a bigot, is an insufferable<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  prig?  She  suffers nervous prostrations and is given to dialogue like,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Are you vexed with me, Papa?&quot; Following this line,  she frequently<br/>\nkneels<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  at his feet.  Later, when she is a woman, Elsie says &quot;Unhand me this<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  instant, sir!&quot; and the like.  Naturally, she is utterly beautiful and<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  worshipped by all. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  I love Elsie---the way I love to study poisonous reptiles. As a role<br/>\nmodel<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  OR as history OR as as example of good English composition, Elsie is a<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  disaster. That she is now being touted as a Christian example to<br/>\nmalleable<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  children indicates what the Fundamentalist Right may be all about, a<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  strange world of racial privilege, religious intolerance and child<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  marriage. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Our current president is supported by the religious right who consider<br/>\nhim<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  one of their own.

Although she lives in <br/>\nAlbuquerque, we&#39;ve never met! &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s close friends with a family I know <br/>\nwell in Bonfield, Ontario.  I find that really amusing, but I&#39;m glad to be <br/>\none of her e-mail pals, and she&#39;s a really great writer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her permission to send this to this list, and she wrote &lt;&lt;Share all <br/>\nyou want. I knew you are a home schooler who doesn&#39;t want to marry off her 12 <br/>\nyear old to a patriarch. That is why I e-mailed you. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll below this line is by Sharon Karpinski, of Albuquerque, who&#39;s not a <br/>\nhomeschooler but who is a fine writer and home-philosopher of the highest <br/>\nnature &lt;bwg&gt;:<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I found six Elsie Dinsmore books at a store off Central Avenue. I<br/>\n<br/>\nimmediately bought all that weren&#39;t duplicates to mine even though I paid<br/>\n<br/>\n$1. apiece for the last ones I laid hands on (in Washburn, Wisconsin 15<br/>\n<br/>\nyears ago) and these had escalated to $14.   &quot;You were lucky to get so<br/>\n<br/>\nmany,&quot; the bookstore owner said. &quot; These just came in. They are very<br/>\n<br/>\npopular. They just fly off the shelves once I put them on my mailing<br/>\n<br/>\nlists.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was amazed since, for many years, I was the only person I knew who was<br/>\n<br/>\nintimately acquainted with Elsie---or even acquainted at all. My<br/>\n<br/>\ngrandmother, a huge fan in her youth (we are now back to around 1906)  had<br/>\n<br/>\nread every single Elsie book as a child. Since no one in my family ever<br/>\n<br/>\nthrew out a book, I&#39;d read several a good fifty years after they&#39;d gone out<br/>\n<br/>\nof print.  Curiosity piqued, I went to the Net to find 2,110 entries for<br/>\n<br/>\nElsie. I discovered, to my horror, that Elsie is being pushed by Christian<br/>\n<br/>\nFundamentalists as achild,<br/>\n<br/>\nexemplifies the idea that character counts in the face of tribulation. The<br/>\n<br/>\nbooks accurately picture 19th century life.&quot;  It turns out that the<br/>\n<br/>\nFundamentalist press has even reprinted the first four Elsie books. The<br/>\n<br/>\nfirst is now titled Elsie, the Endless Wait  (this is when she is pilloried<br/>\n<br/>\nby her cousins while longing for her absent father). There is even a line<br/>\n<br/>\nof Elsie dolls illustrating pertinent moments in the stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit of literary background: The Elsie Dinsmore series, written by Martha<br/>\n<br/>\nFinlay) was quite possibly the first set of &quot;girls&quot; books. The Dodd Company<br/>\n<br/>\n(before Meade came along) published the first story in 1868. This antedates<br/>\n<br/>\neven Little Women though Louisa was a far better writer. In their day,<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich lasted about fifty years, Elsie sold hugely. There were eventually<br/>\n<br/>\nperhaps twenty five or thirty books and the story was  terminated only<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause Finlay died.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the fact that I dote on Elsie, I am horrified that defenseless<br/>\n<br/>\nChristian children are being assigned this book  because---for those of you<br/>\n<br/>\nthat are not Elsie fans---Elsie is NOT Nancy Drew in a hoopskirt . A brief<br/>\n<br/>\nsummary:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElsie is a Southern heiress who came to be because her father and mother<br/>\n<br/>\nfell in love and eloped when he was seventeen and she was fifteen. Elsie&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nmother died in childbirth at 16. Her father Horace, horrified, took off for<br/>\n<br/>\nEurope leaving Elsie to be raised by Mrs. Murray, a Scotch-Presyterian<br/>\n<br/>\nhousekeeper and Chloe, Elsie&#39;s beloved black Mammie, who adores all white<br/>\n<br/>\nfolk but particularly adores Elsie. When Mrs. Murray kicks the bucket,<br/>\n<br/>\nElsie is sent to live with her paternal Grandfather and his second wife, a<br/>\n<br/>\nsocial climber with a passel of awful children, most notably Enna, who<br/>\n<br/>\nabuses Elsie daily. The story opens as Horace arrives home from Europe when<br/>\n<br/>\nElsie is eight. He cannot stand the sight of her, because she looks exactly<br/>\n<br/>\nlike his dead wife, and he cannot stand listening to her either, because<br/>\n<br/>\nshe is a devout Christian who won&#39;t play secular songs on Sunday or wear<br/>\n<br/>\nnew clothes to church because they would take her mind off worship in God&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nhouse. Elsie falls off piano benches, passes into brain fever and suffers<br/>\n<br/>\nother horrors too numerous to mention until such a time as she convinces<br/>\n<br/>\nher father to be saved too. Now mind you, all of the above is not a world<br/>\n<br/>\nthat I embrace but although narrowly righteous, it&#39;s not  deviant. What IS<br/>\n<br/>\nhorrifying about the assignment of these books to unknowing children is<br/>\n<br/>\nthat the following elements ALSO figure in Elsie&#39;s perennial saga:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Elsie owns three hundred slaves in her own name and, in book four, buys<br/>\n<br/>\nseveral more. She always calls them &quot;my people&quot; as in,&quot; my possessions.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. All the black people in the book (with the exception of Chloe&#39;s &quot;unruly<br/>\n<br/>\nbuck husband&quot; who is sold away from her) love the Massa and give thanks<br/>\n<br/>\npractically daily for their servitude. Chloe&#39;s husband, in his old age,<br/>\n<br/>\nsees the light of God and becomes a willing slave once more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Elsie&#39;s relationship with her father is most peculiar, involving as it<br/>\n<br/>\ndoes many mouth-to-mouth kisses and caresses. She strokes him regularly and<br/>\n<br/>\nspeaks of her adoration. He returns it. Every day she sits on his lap as he<br/>\n<br/>\ninstructs her. This goes on until she is fifteen or so. She does nothing<br/>\n<br/>\nwithout his permission, because to obey one&#39;s parents is absolute filial<br/>\n<br/>\nduty,  even unto her 25th year. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4. After a brief interlude with a fortune hunter in Book 3 (a man that<br/>\n<br/>\nHorace quickly dispatches to the state pen), Elsie marries her father&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nbest friend, who is 20 years older than she is and whom she has known since<br/>\n<br/>\nshe was eight.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is for reasons 3 and 4 that I, while in high school, wrote an essay<br/>\n<br/>\ncalled &quot;Elsie Dinsmore Meets Sigmund Freud.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Elsie is not an inclusive Christian. In books one and two she is<br/>\n<br/>\nthreatened with convent school. She knows this is the end for her because<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat the priests and nuns do in those places is unspeakable. Mrs. Murray,<br/>\n<br/>\nher old housekeeper, told her all about it. At the very least she will be<br/>\n<br/>\nlocked away and tortured until she converts. Papists are condemned in<br/>\n<br/>\nseveral of the following books too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6.
