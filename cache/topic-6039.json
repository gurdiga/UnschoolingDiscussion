When I was reading from the list a lot more in Nov and Dec, I <br/>\nthought this list had a predominantly unschooling approach.  I think of <br/>\nunschooling as the child led learning that is written about in The Teenage <br/>\nLiberation Handbook and John Holt&#39;s books, etc.  I think many people come to <br/>\nthis approach over time as their homeschooling evolves.  We started off years <br/>\nago as a school at home approach and gradually lightened up more and more.  <br/>\nNow I strongly believe in the unschooling approach.  I have seen that other <br/>\napproaches lead to threats, blackmail, and various forms of unhealthy <br/>\ncoersion to &quot;make&quot; the child do or learn what we have decided he must at a <br/>\ngiven time.  I wish I had realized all of this a lot sooner but I am glad <br/>\nthat I did at least figure it out while all my kids are still kids.<br/>\n     While we were in Minnesota, I listened to a friend of mine trying to <br/>\nmake her 7 year old son do a stack of worksheets he&#39;d brought home over <br/>\nChristmas vacation.  He had spent 7 hours rewriting some sentences to correct <br/>\nthe mistakes and she was really frustrated with him.  She told him if he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get it done soon, he would be missing the Christmas party at his <br/>\ngrandparents&#39; that his siblings and cousins would be at (a special one for <br/>\njust the kids).  I felt so sorry for him and yet I realized that those kinds <br/>\nof threats are common methods used to make kids do school work.  Worst of <br/>\nall, I remembered using similar tactics when my oldest was little and in <br/>\npublic school.  I thought I HAD to make him do the work and I didn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat else to do when he wouldn&#39;t.  <br/>\n     I believe those kinds of threats are inherrent in forced learning.  That <br/>\nis why I have become such a strong believer in unschooling.  Anyway, just <br/>\nsome thoughts brought on by your question...<br/>\n<br/>\n     Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Marbleface@aol.com","from":"Marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"qlluIVQ2tpiII7uMKClKrM0xSqPIuKexo7iJCwSuHjcMU7bXXXVvfCzjojkJPe-Gp6tgGuiI9dQD","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Definition Please","postDate":"949427216","msgId":6046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOTUuNjA0Ni45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6045,"nextInTopic":6084,"prevInTime":6045,"nextInTime":6047,"topicId":6039,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 02/01/2000 4:28:13 PM !!!First Boot!!!, lurine@softcom.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1526758487\">In a message dated 02/01/2000 4:28:13 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; What do the folks on this list think unschooling is/define<br/>\n unschooling as?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso not trying to offend you Lynda --<br/>\n<br/>\nBut -- what do you want it to mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"FLASNOFLAK@aol.com","from":"FLASNOFLAK@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nbunt4xNzQroYfK0sKg4M-MIQzwyItvgRoMvzF1qtQoRwK_v7qShjJUOiCaPCZzd9Yz0jdUsE8_w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Definition Please","postDate":"949424690","msgId":6045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOTUuNjA0NS45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6043,"nextInTopic":6046,"prevInTime":6044,"nextInTime":6046,"topicId":6039,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 02/01/2000 11:28:12 AM Eastern Standard Time, lurine@softcom.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-412964867\">In a message dated 02/01/2000 11:28:12 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I have a serious question and it is not meant to inflame anyone&#39;s<br/>\n sensibilities.

I have been chastised at a local support group because they <br/>\nfelt that *unschooling* meant that we could not ever use any books or <br/>\nanything even remotely *schoolish*!  Seriously!  The point of <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling to me is that as a parent I believe there is a <br/>\nbetter more individualized way to teach my own children ,(there are also many <br/>\nother reasons why I chose to keep my children home).  My point is, how can <br/>\none definition fit so many different ways of life??  <br/>\n��� Dena���<br/>\nMom to Trenton and Callista<br/>\n|{|{|{</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lisa Bugg","from":"&quot;Lisa Bugg&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MQX44vNrTuTkjeF1GU0NOW-Qbs9YyFOlIUwUbQveGtopxUi4PIcOEOymcRkxjKkM5F-maiMxusmnSVbqpyh9xcjcXW5clz-3bIFx5dA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Definition Please","postDate":"949423540","msgId":6043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOTUuNjA0My45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6039,"nextInTopic":6045,"prevInTime":6042,"nextInTime":6044,"topicId":6039,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some people take years to<br/>\nmove through all their unstated assumptions about learning and school.  We<br/>\nare all at very different places in our own journey, so therefore you&#39;re not<br/>\ngoing to hear a party line answer, not<br/>\neven an unschooling party line answer to most questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know for a fact that trying to define unschooling will bring out a whole<br/>\nhost of folks though. &lt;VBG&gt;  We&#39;re the most vocal  of the *don&#39;t define me<br/>\nfor me * groups that I have ever run across.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one thing that we are not doing on this list, we are not hearing<br/>\nfrom our long-long term unschoolers.  And we aren&#39;t doing much talking about<br/>\nwhat affect our unschooling kids are having out there in the world.. that is<br/>\nif we can tell what might be going on. I suspect that might be because life<br/>\nis so very busy and hectic, at least it is for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some friends here who want to start a group called LLL -The Next<br/>\nGeneration. Our kids are way past the nursing/toddler age, but we find we<br/>\nstill need support as our parenting is oh so very different. And not just<br/>\ndifferent in the educational arena either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Lynda, what do you have on your mind?
