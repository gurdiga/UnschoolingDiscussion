We went to the library and got<br/>\n&gt; books on rats and read alot. We chose a young male rat and for the first<br/>\n&gt; little bit he was pretty sweet. I figured it was his settling in period.<br/>\n&gt; But pretty soon he was nipping us, even when we were careful to wash our<br/>\n&gt; hands so no food smell was on them.<br/>\n&gt;   I can not figure what we did wrong. We bought a really large homemade<br/>\n&gt; wood and wire cage that allowed tons of room and he had lots of climbing<br/>\n&gt; room.<br/>\n&gt;   I found him another home as we had little ones and I was concerned they<br/>\n&gt; would get their fingers nipped. Is it possible he did not have enough<br/>\n&gt; physical attention or are males more aggressive?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sharon,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did a lot of research too. We heard that the boys are actually more <br/>\nsnuggly and quiet---easy-going. We all got females because they were <br/>\nreportedly &quot;zippier&quot; and easier to train. But there are variations in lines <br/>\nand types and colors.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you buy from a breeder? I scream about this all the time with dogs (there <br/>\nI go screaming again! &lt;G&gt;). A reputable breeder will advise all about the <br/>\npositives and negatives--ESPECIALLY the negatives! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problems were probably 1) that you bought a rat that was bred as a feeder <br/>\nrat (petshop purchase?), so he had no socialization at all. {Here we go <br/>\nagain---always that socialization issue! &lt;g&gt;} Reputable breeders gently <br/>\nhandle their babies from day one, so they&#39;re comfortable being handled---even <br/>\nby strangers. Feedera are bred to feed snakes. No one should get too attached <br/>\nto something they&#39;re going to feed to a snake! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 2) you only got one. Rats are EXTREMELY social animals. They can become <br/>\nneurotic if kept as singles. A reputable breeder would NEVER have sold you an <br/>\nonly. They require twos or threes go together---usually same sex unless <br/>\nyou&#39;re buying to breed (then there&#39;s the breeder contract!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d try again, but look up breeders in your area on the rat sites (there are <br/>\na lot of them!). California and Florida are two of the hotbeds of rat shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost breeders will ship or meet you halfway by car (that&#39;s what ours did). <br/>\nYou&#39;ll pay a bit more from a reputable breeder, but the rat will be sweet and <br/>\nclean (they seem not to stink as much as feeder rats).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can give you the names of my breeders in Florida if you&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47730,"nextTopicId":47743}}
