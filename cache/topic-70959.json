Our cat, Molly, is an avid hunter.  <br/>\nShe brought us a prize mouse a few days ago and laid it at my husband&#39;s <br/>\nfeet.  Still alive but shocked beyond belief.  My silly husband recued it <br/>\nand nursed it back to health and set him free.  He&#39;s taken 4 mice from Molly <br/>\nthis week and fixed them all up and sent them on their way.  I keep telling <br/>\nhim she&#39;s just going to get them again.  Don&#39;t most people LIKE that their <br/>\ncats get all the field mice?
