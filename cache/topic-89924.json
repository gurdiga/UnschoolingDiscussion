I checked out the one step ahead &quot;rainy day combo&quot; and the IKEA sets.  <br/>\nWhat a great idea!  When my son was a baby, we had a toddler swing handing <br/>\nfrom beams in the basement.  Then we finished the basement into a playroom and <br/>\ndon&#39;t have the beams anymore, they are above the drop ceiling!<br/>\nBut the swing in the doorway looks great!  I&#39;m wondering... for those of you <br/>\nwho have them... the one step ahead swing doesn&#39;t actually screw into the <br/>\ndoorway, so how is it sturdy enough to stay up holding a larger child (weight <br/>\nrated to 100lbs)?  I don&#39;t want it to come down on my son&#39;s head while swinging.  <br/>\nAlso, I&#39;m not sure our door frame overhead would be sturdy enough to hang <br/>\nhooks into for holding the weight of a swing (the IKEA model hangs from hooks).<br/>\nGee, we have a small slide inside.  When we get that trampoline (which I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen hoping to find at a garage sale in the summer, but want now)....we&#39;ll be a <br/>\nbig indoor playground.  Now, just need a big refrigerator box to make some <br/>\ntunnels/forts!<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89890,"nextTopicId":89845}}
