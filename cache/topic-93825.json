I was a terrible <br/>\n<br/>\nperfectionist - blamed it on my parents who did expect a lot from us <br/>\n<br/>\n(straight A&#39;s and all that). But now I see that my kids are often <br/>\n<br/>\nperfectionists, even though they don&#39;t have any of that pressure from <br/>\n<br/>\nparents or schools. So I&#39;ve come to believe that a lot of <br/>\n<br/>\nperfectionism is just personality. On the other hand, there&#39;s a lot <br/>\n<br/>\nof things that I didn&#39;t know as a perfectionist child that I&#39;ve <br/>\n<br/>\nlearned along the way as an adult. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I was going to speak at a conference (something local to me),  <br/>\nI wanted a handout.

You may step back and view the entire world-not just your <br/>\nhome, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a <br/>\nlaboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, animals, <br/>\nhistory, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a book), music, <br/>\nart , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, and ideas <br/>\nwithout end. Although collections of these treasures have been located in museums <br/>\nfor your convenience, they are to be found everywhere else, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice <br/>\nwhen your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make mistakes, <br/>\nand to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children to <br/>\nexperience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them something to <br/>\ndo. <br/>\nHenceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything <br/>\nyou start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be discontinued as soon as <br/>\nsomething more interesting comes along (or for any other reason) without <br/>\npenalty, and picked up again at any time in the future (or never). <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>\nfeel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>\nharm. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to <br/>\nthink theirs. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>\nprivileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>\ncreating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to obtain <br/>\napproval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do <br/>\nare exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd <br/>\n<br/>\n------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been published in homeschooling newsletters and borrowed and changed a <br/>\nbig on a couple of other websites.  Once, interestingly, all that was added <br/>\nwas &quot;and libraries&quot; after the &quot;in museums&quot; part and I found it really bothered <br/>\nme.  Another time it was quite rewritten for a medical self-help/recovery site.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, even though I have hundreds printed for the upcoming conferences and <br/>\nI can&#39;t change it at this point, I&#39;m willing to discuss that <br/>\nquestion/criticism if the person&#39;s still around.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND, I was wondering if anyone saved a copy of the anti-version that was made <br/>\nup by unschooling detractors years ago on AOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93751,"nextTopicId":93829}}
