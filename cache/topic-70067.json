BUT it kinda bugs me that you<br/>\nasked this question at 8:17 this morning, and plenty of people (myself<br/>\nincluded) took time and effort to post to your questions and concerns. Three<br/>\nhours later, you &quot;have just found out&quot; that the local colleges &quot;encourage<br/>\nstudetns to be 16 or older&quot;, and half a day later, you come back with &quot;since<br/>\nthey don&#39;t accept students under 16, it&#39;s no longer an issue..&quot;<br/>\nThen *why the heck* did you post about it? I have to wonder if this was some<br/>\nkind of troll post, just to see what you would get back from the list. To<br/>\nme, it feels like a waste of everyone&#39;s valuable time (hmmm.... this sounds<br/>\nfamiliar). I somehow can&#39;t totally buy that between 8:17 and 11:45 (or<br/>\nwhatever the equivalents in your local time), you called every one of the<br/>\nlocal colleges (you used the plural there) and found that all of them<br/>\n&quot;encourage&quot; students to be 16. Then by 3:56 *the same day*, none of them are<br/>\nnow &quot;accepting&quot; 16 year old students at all so it&#39;s &quot;no longer an issue&quot;<br/>\nI hate to say it, but I really do wish you would go away and stop wasting<br/>\neveryone&#39;s time here. There are lots of people who post here who are new to<br/>\nunschooling and many have questions I have heard over and over through the<br/>\nyears that I&#39;ve been on this list, but most of them post in good faith. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure that I can say the same for you, and I find that disturbing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, I&#39;m sure they do actually accept students under the age of 16. When I<br/>\nstarted college, &quot;they&quot; (the University) &quot;did not accept&quot; 16 year old<br/>\nstudents, let alone ones without a high school diploma (I rose out of high<br/>\nschool instead of finishing). Fortunately, &quot;they&quot; were convinced otherwise<br/>\nby a persistent kid (me). If it&#39;s actually true that your daughter really<br/>\ndid want to go to college, I&#39;m sure she could get past the 16-year-old<br/>\nthing. Plenty of kids do. Heck, I worked with someone at Microsoft that<br/>\n*graduated* from *MIT* at the age of 16. And MIT is not exactly easy to get<br/>\ninto. I&#39;m willing to bet that a local community college could be persuaded<br/>\nto take a younger kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all things considered, this whole thread smells like a dead herring. Or<br/>\nis that a red herring... either way it stinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70039,"nextTopicId":70069}}
