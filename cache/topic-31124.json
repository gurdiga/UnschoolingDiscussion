If however <br/>\nthere was no health related issue with not brushing their teeth, then <br/>\nthey would remember to brush their teeth on their own once they <br/>\nwanted to.  So how about this for a come back, why do they have to <br/>\nget to the point of being embarrassed in order to start brushing <br/>\ntheir teeth? So now what do you say?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Pat<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is another one of those issues that is different for my son than <br/>\nfor my daughters.  I never had to order the girls to brush their <br/>\nteeth.  They learned HOW from me when they were toddlers and they <br/>\njust did it when they wanted to which was always enough to keep their <br/>\nteeth reasonably healthy.  So, in most cases I think a hands off <br/>\napproach can work for this kind of issue.  (However, do step in when <br/>\nthe gums are receding and the teeth are orange!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think neatness is genetic.  My dad was a pack-rat and so am I <br/>\nand so are my kids.  My dad had no organizational genes though.  I <br/>\nhave a enough to get by and so do my girls.  We still don&#39;t live like <br/>\nmy mother would like, but we aren&#39;t wallowing in stuff either.  Now <br/>\nthat we have a room for everybody, I made it clear that I do not want <br/>\nto be tripping on their stuff in the public areas.  My working <br/>\nprojects are contained to the area around my chair, theirs have to be <br/>\ncontained in an equal fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then you get into the murky issue of handwriting.  My was <br/>\natrocious until I got to college.  My cursive is still atrocious.  I <br/>\nprint, my dad always printed and the brothers that were my dad lost <br/>\ncontact with when they were 4 and 6 print.  When I got in touch with <br/>\nmy half brother as an adult, I was SHOCKED at the similarity in our <br/>\nwriting.  There has to be a genetic link there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think being able to communicate is important but cursive writing <br/>\nisn&#39;t.  Ask yourself if the child in question is capable of leaving <br/>\nyou a note that you can read.  If the answer is yes, the child is  <br/>\nfunctional enough and can make his own decision about how important <br/>\nneatness and practice are.  And it does not matter one bit if the <br/>\nnote is cursive, printed or typed.  As long as the child can <br/>\ncommunicate when he needs to, all is well. (age is a factor here <br/>\ntoo.  I think as teh mom of teens.  If you have toddlers, don&#39;t <br/>\nexpect note writing yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59497572,"authorName":"Sarah Carothers","from":"Sarah Carothers &lt;puddles@...&gt;","profile":"sarahjocarothers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Flight/flying was: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Covering the basics","postDate":"1011578276","msgId":31162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBkZGE5NTM1NTAxMTUxMkZFOEBtYWlsOC50cmlhZC5yci5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0ZGZjMTQ0ODAwMTUxMkZFNkBNYWlsNi50cmlhZC5yci5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PFBHRUZKT0JOTklDRUJKSEpLUEtQTUVOT0NKQUEuTGVzbGllTW95ZXJAZ2VvdGVjLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":31161,"nextInTopic":31163,"prevInTime":31161,"nextInTime":31163,"topicId":31124,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Get well soon, Leslie!

The Young Eagles Program is designed<br/>\nto introduce young people to aviation. The pilot will<br/>\nusually talk to the kids about the plane, aeronautical<br/>\ncharts/reference points, preflight inspections, instrument<br/>\npanels, & the parts of the plane. While the flight is<br/>\nusually a one day event, there are also summer programs<br/>\navailable at their headquarters. The flights can be found<br/>\nall over the country.

My 10 yo played the violin in 3rd and 4th grade ps.  My older dd started in 5th grade and played in 5th and 6th grade ps.  This year, I&#39;ve been paying for private lessons so they could continue their instruments while they homeschool.  My 10 yo dd decided there was no purpose to playing the violin since she didn&#39;t have an orchestra to play with so she dropped it around Christmas.  My 12 yo dd likes her cello, likes going to her lesson but does not practice much.  I don&#39;t know the right way to handle this.  I have a feeling that at some point, she will get more into playing and practicing just because she enjoys it. On the other hand, it seems kind of odd to keep pay for lessons when she doesn&#39;t practice.  I asked her how long she thought I should continue to pay for her lessons if she wasn&#39;t practicing.  She said she planned on practicing more and would not give me an answer.  Any ideas?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 20, 2002 4:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Covering the basics<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, 20 Jan 2002 16:10:37 -0500, Pat Cald... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;Do you ever wonder what you might have done with your<br/>\n&gt;cello playing if you had learned at an earlier age?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Do your children play an instrument?

I so appreciate your directness.  I<br/>\nhate not really knowing what people are thinking because they are concerned<br/>\nabout hurting my feelings.  These discussion are meant to help people sort<br/>\nthings out.  This is good!<br/>\n&gt;  In an earlier post I wrote:<br/>\n&gt; + How can we make it easier for<br/>\n&gt; + our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not<br/>\n&gt; + all that much fun?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Leslies response to my question:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; + Can you give a specific example?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Examples would be handwriting, multiplication and addition facts, grammar,<br/>\nlearning a foreign language and possibly some academics necessary for<br/>\ncollege.  I see that you don&#39;t feel it is our responsibility to &quot;entertain<br/>\nor educate&quot;.  That sure makes my job easy!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So why is learning to brush ones teeth or using good manners more<br/>\nimportant than learning to write legibly?  I could take the same approach<br/>\nwith basic life skills and figure when my kids got embarrassed enough about<br/>\ntheir poor hygene they would do something about it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m<br/>\n99% sold on everything you are saying, but there is still that darned 1%.<br/>\nThis is what is bothering me - I think twice a day teeth brushing is an<br/>\nimportant daily habit. My kids don&#39;t seem to think the same.  I still have<br/>\nto ask my 10 and 12 yos if they brushed their teeth, they don&#39;t always<br/>\nremember.  I don&#39;t make it fun for them, I talk to them about the importance<br/>\nof it, I&#39;ve helped them with a routine so they will always remember,and I<br/>\nmodel good hygene myself, so what&#39;s up with that!!  Do you realize how much<br/>\neasier life is when we learn to clean as we go instead of letting things get<br/>\nway out of hand and then getting mad, frustrated, embarrassed etc. enough to<br/>\ntry to learn to be neat.  It takes years of small incremental training to<br/>\ndevelop good life skills, why not take the same approach to some of the<br/>\nbasic academic skills?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is what I think you will say.  If the kids don&#39;t brush their teeth,<br/>\nthey will develop tooth decay and that is a consequence far different from<br/>\nbeing embarrassed about your spelling.  If however there was no health<br/>\nrelated issue with not brushing their teeth, then they would remember to<br/>\nbrush their teeth on their own once they wanted to.  So how about this for a<br/>\ncome back, why do they have to get to the point of being embarrassed in<br/>\norder to start brushing their teeth?

This occurred after watching Trauma in  the ER . She asked me<br/>\n&gt; what it takes to become a doctor and I, having no clue, went to<br/>\n&gt; Borders and bought a few books on becoming a doctor (written by<br/>\n&gt; doctors.. one female). I read them ( more on why *I* read them rather<br/>\n&gt; than dd reading them to follow) and reported back that it&#39;s a tough<br/>\n&gt; road, full of obstacles and costly and all the negatives plus the<br/>\n&gt; positives. Because it is such a monumental task in my eyes, I<br/>\n&gt; suggested she go to the hospital and follow a doctor around to see if<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what she really liked. I mean, tv is one thing... real life<br/>\n&gt; guts spilled out on a table is another. Well, the arrangements were<br/>\n&gt; made and she *voluntarily* got up and out of the house by 6:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; (this from a child who regularly sleeps till noon or later) and when<br/>\n&gt; she got there, my friend who arranged this got some scrubs for Katie<br/>\n&gt; and they were off.  I was to come back in 5-6 hours. I figured that<br/>\n&gt; when I returned, she&#39;d be sick on her stomach, white as a sheet and<br/>\n&gt; certain that being a doctor was *not* what it&#39;s cracked up to be.<br/>\n&gt; Well sir, Mothers should never think &lt;bwg&gt; because we&#39;re always<br/>\n&gt; wrong! &lt;g&gt;  I have never *seen* her so psyched over something! She<br/>\n&gt; loved this better than anything she&#39;s ever done... including<br/>\n&gt; gymnastics and dance and all the fun stuff she does.<br/>\n&gt; The next step was to tell her what all she needs to study to become a<br/>\n&gt; doctor and how important SAT&#39;s and GPA&#39;s are in this field because of<br/>\n&gt; the difficulty of getting into med school.  After I spread the tough<br/>\n&gt; stuff on thick, her response was &quot;get the books. I&#39;m ready.&quot;  Then<br/>\n&gt; and since then, she&#39;s had me get the following... and I&#39;ll denote the<br/>\n&gt; ones she uses with a &quot; * &quot;<br/>\n&gt; Anatomy and Physiology***(her absolute favorite)<br/>\n&gt; Conceptual Physics*<br/>\n&gt; Harold Jacob&#39;s Elementary Algebra*<br/>\n&gt; Harold Jacobs Geometry... on back order as we speak<br/>\n&gt; College Biology book from Goodwill*<br/>\n&gt; Latin (bummed out)<br/>\n&gt; Spanish (bummed out)<br/>\n&gt; Chemistry book (used from local prep school)*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never, ever have to force or encourage her to &quot;do schoolwork&quot;. She<br/>\n&gt; has set her goal, knows what it takes and *she* is in charge. All I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; doing is guiding her and trying to make it a smooth ride whenever I<br/>\n&gt; can. For example, in 8th grade she took the SAT to see how she&#39;d do<br/>\n&gt; and although for an 8th grader it was good, the results were not what<br/>\n&gt; she expected. That is why I&#39;ve been asking the list for SAT prep<br/>\n&gt; information... to determine what would be the best &#39;next step&#39; for<br/>\n&gt; her. Clearly, she&#39;ll improve because she has studied a lot more stuff<br/>\n&gt; since initially taking the SAT but because this goal is so important<br/>\n&gt; to her and because I see her taking all the other steps to reach this<br/>\n&gt; goal, I&#39;ve taken it upon myself to find out about this SAT deal and<br/>\n&gt; what can be done. I&#39;ll present her with my findings in the end and<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;ll decide what, if anything, she wants to do about it.<br/>\n&gt; .. oh, and by the way, she never sat down and memorized the<br/>\n&gt; multiplication tables :-). That was never isolated out of the bigger<br/>\n&gt; picture.... learning the multiplication tables became necessary to do<br/>\n&gt; the Algebra.  Over time, as she has had to use them, she has learned<br/>\n&gt; them with use of a calculator but there never was a moment when we<br/>\n&gt; used flash cards and drill and kill and so on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, back to the &#39;me researching rather than her&#39; thing.  Katie does<br/>\n&gt; not like to read for pleasure. She will read factual books but even<br/>\n&gt; then, she&#39;d rather glean the information some other way. The other<br/>\n&gt; day she was bugging dh over something from the physics book. They sat<br/>\n&gt; at the table and he was describing what he had read and I interrupted<br/>\n&gt; and said, &quot;Katie, can&#39;t you read that yourself? Do you not understand<br/>\n&gt; it??&quot; She replied... with a grin... &quot;oh, I understand it, Mom. I just<br/>\n&gt; hate to read.

I so appreciate your directness.  I hate not really knowing what people are thinking because they are concerned about hurting my feelings.  These discussion are meant to help people sort things out.  This is good!<br/>\n In an earlier post I wrote:<br/>\n+ How can we make it easier for<br/>\n+ our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not<br/>\n+ all that much fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslies response to my question:<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Can you give a specific example? <br/>\n<br/>\nExamples would be handwriting, multiplication and addition facts, grammar, learning a foreign language and possibly some academics necessary for college.  I see that you don&#39;t feel it is our responsibility to &quot;entertain or educate&quot;.  That sure makes my job easy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why is learning to brush ones teeth or using good manners more important than learning to write legibly?  I could take the same approach with basic life skills and figure when my kids got embarrassed enough about their poor hygene they would do something about it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m 99% sold on everything you are saying, but there is still that darned 1%.  This is what is bothering me - I think twice a day teeth brushing is an important daily habit. My kids don&#39;t seem to think the same.  I still have to ask my 10 and 12 yos if they brushed their teeth, they don&#39;t always remember.  I don&#39;t make it fun for them, I talk to them about the importance of it, I&#39;ve helped them with a routine so they will always remember,and I model good hygene myself, so what&#39;s up with that!!  Do you realize how much easier life is when we learn to clean as we go instead of letting things get way out of hand and then getting mad, frustrated, embarrassed etc. enough to try to learn to be neat.  It takes years of small incremental training to develop good life skills, why not take the same approach to some of the basic academic skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what I think you will say.  If the kids don&#39;t brush their teeth, they will develop tooth decay and that is a consequence far different from being embarrassed about your spelling.  If however there was no health related issue with not brushing their teeth, then they would remember to brush their teeth on their own once they wanted to.  So how about this for a come back, why do they have to get to the point of being embarrassed in order to start brushing their teeth? So now what do you say?<br/>\n <br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59497572,"authorName":"Sarah Carothers","from":"Sarah Carothers &lt;puddles@...&gt;","profile":"sarahjocarothers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Covering the basics","postDate":"1011555313","msgId":31137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBkNDM0MTIzMzE5MTQxMkZFNkBNYWlsNi50cmlhZC5yci5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDA3ZGI2NTc0MDE4MTQxMkZFNkBNYWlsNi50cmlhZC5yci5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTIwMTg1OS5nMEtJd21TcDAxMjY2OEBzbTEzLnRleGFzLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31136,"nextInTopic":31138,"prevInTime":31136,"nextInTime":31138,"topicId":31124,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Because it is such a monumental task in my eyes, I<br/>\n&gt; suggested she go to the hospital and follow a doctor around to see if<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what she really liked. I mean, tv is one thing... real life<br/>\n&gt; guts spilled out on a table is another. Well, the arrangements were<br/>\n&gt; made and she *voluntarily* got up and out of the house by 6:00 AM<br/>\n&gt; (this from a child who regularly sleeps till noon or later) and when<br/>\n&gt; she got there, my friend who arranged this got some scrubs for Katie<br/>\n&gt; and they were off.  I was to come back in 5-6 hours. I figured that<br/>\n&gt; when I returned, she&#39;d be sick on her stomach, white as a sheet and<br/>\n&gt; certain that being a doctor was *not* what it&#39;s cracked up to be.<br/>\n&gt; Well sir, Mothers should never think &lt;bwg&gt; because we&#39;re always<br/>\n&gt; wrong! &lt;g&gt;  I have never *seen* her so psyched over something!

That was never isolated out of the bigger<br/>\n&gt; picture.... learning the multiplication tables became necessary to do<br/>\n&gt; the Algebra.

You don&#39;t know<br/>\nmy son, so I can see how you might think this.  My son just hasn&#39;t learned<br/>\nthem YET.  They haven&#39;t had compelling relevance to him yet.  They will when<br/>\nhe needs them for Algebra or for something else and I&#39;m positive he&#39;ll learn<br/>\nthem in just seconds or minutes.  (Incidentally, even though he hasn&#39;t<br/>\nstarted the American School algebra course yet, he has done lots of algebra<br/>\njust because he found it interesting.)  He learns so effortlessly, it seems<br/>\nto me, and I have no doubt that if/when he chooses to memorize his<br/>\nmultiplication tables, for example, he will do so very quickly.  It isn&#39;t a<br/>\nmotivation problem, though...If I were to look at it as a problem, I would<br/>\nsee it as a timing one.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting back to my story about Matthew learning physics when he &quot;should&quot;<br/>\nhave been learning English the other day.....  Would it have been more<br/>\ndesirable to tell him, &quot;put down that physics book right now and memorize<br/>\nyour multiplication tables&quot;?  He&#39;s read dozens of HTML and JAVA<br/>\nhandbooks...should I tell him to put those aside until he learns Biology?<br/>\nWhy or why not?  How about if he is playing guitar?  Working on his Eagle<br/>\nScout project?  Just what are the &quot;basics&quot; in HIS life?<br/>\n<br/>\n+ There are several things I can think of that I would like to have<br/>\n+ learned or would like to learn that I do not want to put the<br/>\n+ effort into learning *on my own*.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy answer to that would be that you can&#39;t have everything!  We all have 24<br/>\nhours in a day.  We choose how to spend those hours. We are not victims of<br/>\nthe clock....we have choices about the way we spend our time.  You say<br/>\nyou&#39;re not motivated to exercise on your own, so you seek out a situation<br/>\n(companionship, coaching) to motivate you.  That&#39;s what my kids do, too.  In<br/>\nfact, when they had decided to memorize their multiplication tables, they<br/>\ndid seek out my help to assist them and to help them stay focused.  (There<br/>\nwas a point at which they became disinterested, though--for now.)  At other<br/>\ntimes, they have sought out different mentors or teachers or companions or<br/>\nsituations for things they wanted or needed to learn or do that were easier<br/>\nwith another motivator.  My son has taught himself to play the guitar, but<br/>\nnow wants to take lessons for some of those reasons.  He&#39;s taken computer<br/>\nclasses, sailing classes, he&#39;s gone to leadership training schools in other<br/>\nstates (with Scouts), my daughters both take art classes; one takes dance<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Is this because I was taught<br/>\n+ in ps or is it because self-discipline and self-motivation<br/>\n+ require a lot of energy and my desire has not reached that level,<br/>\n+ or is it because I have other responsibilities at this time in my<br/>\n+ life that take priority?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would guess &quot;all of the above&quot;, but primarily the latter (other<br/>\nresponsibilities that take priority).  24 hours in a day....<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Multiplication tables are like exercise<br/>\n+ and for your son, physics is like winning a national medal.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don&#39;t see it like that, nor does he.  He studies physics only because<br/>\nhe enjoys it.  (Go figure!  I HATE IT!!!  His knowledge surpassed mine when<br/>\nhe was about 6 and I&#39;m not exaggerating.)  It is neither an &quot;exercise&quot; nor a<br/>\n&quot;medal&quot;....it is the process he enjoys--he isn&#39;t working toward some end<br/>\ngoal.  Yes, he will need additional math skills to proceed with physics much<br/>\nfurther....but they aren&#39;t *separate* skills to him....they&#39;re all part of<br/>\nthe whole.  He&#39;s not learning math so he can learn physics....he&#39;s just<br/>\nlearning about things he is interested in.  They interweave.<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Buying a curriculum to motivate him to do basic math is not the<br/>\n+ answer because the child still has to *motivate himself* to do<br/>\n+ work he doesn&#39;t really want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t buy him a curriculum to motivate him to do math....I bought him<br/>\nnumerous resources to assist him when he wants to learn more math.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave an assumption that he &quot;doesn&#39;t really want to do&quot; it.  I don&#39;t even<br/>\nthink that, necessarily, he has to &quot;motivate himself&quot;....perhaps there will<br/>\nbe some outside influence that will serve to motivate him.  (It was this way<br/>\nwith his spelling when others began reading his writing in Boy Scouts....his<br/>\nspelling improved dramatically almost overnight.)  Motivation comes from<br/>\nmany places....including his parents at times--directly or indirectly.<br/>\n<br/>\n+ How can we make it easier for<br/>\n+ our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not<br/>\n+ all that much fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you give a specific example?  I still maintain that learning does *not*<br/>\nhave to be &quot;fun&quot; to entice kids to do it.  In fact, I think that is one of<br/>\nthe most severe of the mistakes that mass education makes.  I shy away from<br/>\nthe workbooks with &quot;busy work&quot; to make things &quot;fun&quot;.  (Things like word<br/>\nsearches and crossword puzzles, for example.)  I hate those kinds of things,<br/>\nand they&#39;re almost all you can find at the &quot;educational stores&quot;.  Not that<br/>\nlearning *can&#39;t* be fun....of course it can.....but some of the times that<br/>\nI&#39;ve witnessed my kids taking the greatest strides in their learning was<br/>\nwhen they were MAD or FRUSTRATED or PERPLEXED or BORED or EMBARRASSED.  When<br/>\nthe adult takes responsibility for &quot;making it fun&quot;, the child is<br/>\ndisenfranchised--their right to their own learning is usurped.  Then the<br/>\nchild&#39;s role in their education is once again relegated to the passive<br/>\nrole---&quot;entertain me&quot;/&quot;educate me&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd re: &quot;learning the basics&quot;:  One sentence in that post I wrote suggested<br/>\nasking other homeschooling parents about what they consider to be<br/>\n&quot;necessary&quot;....or a sign of &quot;education&quot;.  I bet you can all think of<br/>\nexamples like this in the homeschooling families you know....  One<br/>\nhomeschooling friend I have is always ranting about how little ps kids know<br/>\nabout world history and then going on and on about all these kings and<br/>\nqueens and wars and ancient history.  I know almost *nothing* about any of<br/>\nthese kinds of things and, other than a most bare outline, I don&#39;t think it<br/>\nis important for my kids to ever know unless they want to.  I&#39;m 38 and have<br/>\nnever needed to know any of that stuff; I don&#39;t consider it &quot;the basics&quot; at<br/>\nall, but my friend does.<br/>\n<br/>\n+ IMO there is a benefit to knowing the basics.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure there is!  And because there *is* a benefit, unschoolers will have no<br/>\nproblems learning them in their own time frame.<br/>\n<br/>\n+ I wish I could<br/>\n+ build furniture but I was never taught the basics and I have<br/>\n+ decided not to pursue this as a hobby because it requires too<br/>\n+ much energy to go back and learn from scratch.  I know some women<br/>\n+ that wish they could cook.  They never learned the basics and<br/>\n+ have decided it is too much trouble to learn now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s lame.....it&#39;s never to late to learn *if* you really want to<br/>\nknow.  There are lots of things I&#39;d *like* to learn, but only a few I have<br/>\ntime for at any given time; therefore, I&#39;m making a choice, right?  Ranking<br/>\nthings in relative importance in my life.  If a woman really wants to learn<br/>\nto cook, how hard would that be to do??  No one ever taught me a thing about<br/>\ncooking...I was self-taught--unschooled.  I have a friend who amazes me with<br/>\nall the things she will tackle on her own.  There are no excuses--if you<br/>\nreally wanted to learn--if it were really a priority for you--you could do<br/>\nit.  We live in the age of the Internet, after all!  Above all, I want my<br/>\nkids to know that it is possible for them to learn *whatever* they want.<br/>\n(Even when there is no one around to make it &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;easier&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Can we get bye<br/>\n+ without these skills?  Yes.  Would there be more possibilities in<br/>\n+ life if we all had the basics covered?  Yes.  It is easier to<br/>\n+ cover the basics when you are young and have a lot of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBull hockey!  (Pardon my French....and nothing personal, Pat!)  We all have<br/>\n24 hours in a day no matter how old we are.  My kids are often busier than I<br/>\nam.  One of the lies that school taught us is that &quot;the basics&quot; take a long<br/>\ntime to learn.  John Taylor Gatto says that we could learn *all* the basics<br/>\nin just 100 hours.  I&#39;ve heard others say the same sort of thing.  In the<br/>\nearly part of this century, people spent FAR FAR less time in school than<br/>\nkids do now and learned much more than we do.<br/>\n<br/>\n+ Institutions cover the basics of many areas.  How do we provide<br/>\n+ this for our unschooled children and still unschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat, this isn&#39;t a rhetorical question:  What do you consider &quot;the basics&quot;<br/>\nand why?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I do for my children in terms of &quot;basics&quot; is to expose them<br/>\nto as much of the &quot;real world&quot; as possible....so that they have a clear<br/>\nunderstanding of what *is* important to learn and why.  I also have regular<br/>\ndiscussions with them about their learning and what they would like to do<br/>\nbetter or learn more about and how I can help.  There have been situations<br/>\nwhere I have pointed out when certain &quot;basics&quot; would come in handy in their<br/>\nown lives.  (Like Matthew&#39;s spelling when he was feeling self-conscious<br/>\nabout it in Scouts.)  I try to nurture their confidence that nothing is<br/>\n&quot;beyond&quot; them--they can learn whatever they choose to learn.  And that they<br/>\nare responsible for seeing that their own lives are successful (or not),<br/>\nthough I love them and am there to help if they desire it.

Since I too someties *wonder* if my child <br/>\nwill or will not learn the basics... then I think... what ARE the basics?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basics I needed to learn as a kid weren&#39;t the ones that the world <br/>\nneeded by the time I was working. I should of been prepared for <br/>\ntechnology as opposed to that &#39;factory&#39; work mentality, or that <br/>\n&#39;housewife&#39; mentality that they used to give us &#39;girls&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess all I worry is if he learns to read. I think that will be a <br/>\ngiven for a long time to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that. I dunno. *shrug*<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the vid games are preparing the next generation, maybe we&#39;ll have <br/>\n&#39;communicators&#39; that will do all my adding/math for me. Instantly. Who <br/>\nknows?? I can&#39;t even imagine. It would be like my grandmother imagining a <br/>\ntelephone before they had them. Yah know?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the basics to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84135975,"authorName":"Pat Cald...","from":"&quot;Pat Cald...&quot; &lt;homeschoolmd@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolmd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Covering the basics","postDate":"1011498364","msgId":31124,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODkwMWMxYTE2NCRmYzk5NmY0MCQwMzAxYThjMEBvZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PFBHRUZKT0JOTklDRUJKSEpLUEtQS0VOQUNKQUEuTGVzbGllTW95ZXJAZ2VvdGVjLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31125,"prevInTime":31123,"nextInTime":31125,"topicId":31124,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well now Leslie, after reading your post on multiplication, you ve just gotten me going again with lots of questions.

Your son&#39;s difficulty motivating himself to learn certain math basics makes me wonder.  Wondering here!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several things I can think of that I would like to have learned or would like to learn that I do not want to put the effort into learning *on my own*.  Is this because I was taught in ps or is it because self-discipline and self-motivation require a lot of energy and my desire has not reached that level, or is it because I have other responsibilities at this time in my life that take priority?<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to race my bicycle and had a goal to win a national medal.  Every year I followed a very grueling training schedule, by myself, without riding partners because I had a goal to win that medal.  After coming in 3rd many years in a row and failing to win gold when I turned 40, I stopped racing.  I no longer have a goal to win a medal or train that hard but I would like to be physically fit.  I now swim on a masters swim team and need the companionship of other people and the help of a coach to motivate me to exercise.  I can no longer do it on my own, even though I have a desire to be fit.  Multiplication tables are like exercise and for your son, physics is like winning a national medal.  Buying a curriculum to motivate him to do basic math is not the answer because the child still has to *motivate himself* to do work he doesn&#39;t really want to do.  How can we make it easier for our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not all that much fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO there is a benefit to knowing the basics.  I wish I could build furniture but I was never taught the basics and I have decided not to pursue this as a hobby because it requires too much energy to go back and learn from scratch.  I know some women that wish they could cook.  They never learned the basics and have decided it is too much trouble to learn now.  Can we get bye without these skills?  Yes.  Would there be more possibilities in life if we all had the basics covered?  Yes.  It is easier to cover the basics when you are young and have a lot of time.  Institutions cover the basics of many areas.  How do we provide this for our unschooled children and still unschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31229,"nextTopicId":7167}}
