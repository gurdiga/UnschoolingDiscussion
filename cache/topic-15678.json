I don&#39;t know his history which has apparently been<br/>\ndiscussed before, but what I did want to say is this:  I was going to a 2 doctor<br/>\npractice seeing one specifically.  In spite of ds being contantly sick with ear<br/>\ninfections and uri, bronchitis, etc. and have deep, dark circles under his eyes,<br/>\nshe urged me to wait a year or so before testing him because of his age.  He was 4<br/>\nat the time.  Well, after a visit w/parents who have 2 cats that rule the house,<br/>\nand taking him to the ER because of difficulty breathing, the other dr finally<br/>\nurged me to have it done immediately.  Well, lo and behold, he was severely (off<br/>\nthe charts) allergic to dust and dust mites among other things.  Other ds ended up<br/>\nhaving the same alleregies too!  I tried many, many changes in our home to<br/>\naccomodate this without having to begin weekly shots.  (My sister had this her<br/>\nwhole childhood, so I knew what to expect).   Anyway, my efforts weren&#39;t enough,<br/>\nand that didn&#39;t even account for when ds&#39;s would be out and about, so we began<br/>\nweekly shots - they each get one in each arm for the dust and I can&#39;t tell you<br/>\nwhat a HUGE improvement there&#39;s been.  It was a year last November, and if they&#39;ve<br/>\nhad antibiotics more than once since we started, I can&#39;t remember!  Younger one<br/>\nhas beautiful coloring again.  In hindsight I realize this was bothering him for a<br/>\nlong time and it kills me that I didn&#39;t do something sooner.  He knew of no other<br/>\nway than being miserable!  He is my &quot;handful&quot; child anyway, but this has made a<br/>\nwonderful differenc.  While they&#39;d just as soon skip shots, they put up no fuss<br/>\nwhen it&#39;s time to go - I think they realize how much it&#39;s helped them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for what it&#39;s worth, that&#39;s my story...

You can say that you are pro-life but agree that our laws<br/>\n&gt; should be pro-choice. I think there are many people out there with this view.<br/>\n&gt; That would mean that you are personally against it but don&#39;t feel it is your<br/>\n&gt; right to make the choice for other woman. If you want abortion banned, then<br/>\n&gt; you obviously trying to push your views on to other women. There is no way<br/>\n&gt; around it. My solution: if you don&#39;t want to have an abortion, don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; one. Why can&#39;t it be that simple?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In addition, you can&#39;t possibly believe that most people with prolife<br/>\n&gt; &gt; philosophy act like the screaming nuts in front of clinics. Bumper stickers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the like are an exercise in free speech, and even so, I&#39;d be willing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bet that most prolife people don&#39;t use them or any other obvious sign of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their stance. It&#39;s like painting all Xians with a Jerry Falwell brush, or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; blacks with a Jesse Jackson brush, because they are the most vocal in those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; groups.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [This message contained attachments]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 31 Jan 2001 18:00:17 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: kalima &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kalima@...\">kalima@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Introduction & Expeditions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/31/01 5:25:11 AM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kkibort@...\">kkibort@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt; 4.  If there are no uns/hs families around your area,<br/>\n&gt;  what types of people do<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; you like to hang out with/seek out?<br/>\n&gt;  Thats a tough one. We&#39;re Pagan, so finding unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;  is hard enough, but ad Pagan to the mix and its nearly<br/>\n&gt;  impossible. Not that we only look for Pagans, but its<br/>\n&gt;  quite hard to sit through scripture quotes and such<br/>\n&gt;  when , to me, its as painful as country music.<br/>\n&gt;  Basically, I look for natural folks, easy going,<br/>\n&gt;  simple livers. The 2001 Ford Expedition is my first<br/>\n&gt;  clue to run home. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am with you! We are pagan as well. I actually was trying to keep it<br/>\n&gt; quite to let people get to know me first but a woman went and told most<br/>\n&gt; everyone in my old town and well it got ugly fast living in  New England<br/>\n&gt; where some towns like to boost where they use to hang and drown the<br/>\n&gt; witches in the old days. My worst expierance which has made me afraid to<br/>\n&gt; go to things was I replied to a letter in Mothering Magazine and asked<br/>\n&gt; if there were any pagan homeschoolers out there. I got some great<br/>\n&gt; letters and have some wonderful penpals from it but...later I got a<br/>\n&gt; phone call from a local homeschooling mom and an invitation to come up<br/>\n&gt; to thier house later that afternoon. Seems it was come see the Pagan day<br/>\n&gt; and try to convert her. I was so hurt from it and my kids were really<br/>\n&gt; upset. I have friends who are christian and we all get along and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; try to convert each other but this just really pushed me back into my<br/>\n&gt; little shell for awhile.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the Expeditions...gees those things are huge and if you can drive<br/>\n&gt; one more power to you. My dh calls me his little tree hugging hindu<br/>\n&gt; kitchen witch. Well he just recently bought a Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer<br/>\n&gt; Edition. I am against things like this but he wanted a truck to tow a<br/>\n&gt; small boat or to go to the home improvement store to pick up his lumber<br/>\n&gt; since he builds furniture in his spare time. I have been giving him such<br/>\n&gt; a time about calling him yuppie and all but well he loves his new (used)<br/>\n&gt; truck and I have to admit...it is fun to drive. I have to say one of the<br/>\n&gt; most wonderful women I have met who was into many of the same things I<br/>\n&gt; am actually lives in this fancy old house and her and her husband have<br/>\n&gt; his and hers Mercedes.

I know I don&#39;t post often. Seems like since I joined the list<br/>\n&gt; my kids have been taking turns with one cold after another. And lately<br/>\n&gt; it has been my turn to sit in the bed with a box of tissues as well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyhow I just need to share. Maybe get something off my chest. I am sure<br/>\n&gt; people have doubts when they are homeschooling if they are doing the<br/>\n&gt; right thing. And sometimes I think the doubts are easier to get into<br/>\n&gt; when we unschool. I recently saw something on tv that had a<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling family in it and the kids were all sitting nicely at the<br/>\n&gt; table doing work out of book. I thought isnt that sweet. Then looked<br/>\n&gt; around at my family and thought gees maybe I should be pushing more for<br/>\n&gt; them to do &quot;real&quot; work. Like books and paper and such. Of course a few<br/>\n&gt; mintues later I was thinking what the heck just got into me. I want my<br/>\n&gt; kids to be individuals and learn at thier own pace and learn what they<br/>\n&gt; want and discover along the way who they are. But sometimes I wonder<br/>\n&gt; about the choices I make as a parent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe it is harder since it seems I find so little in common with<br/>\n&gt; famlies here locally. I don&#39;t know many families that do family bed or<br/>\n&gt; use cloth diapers or breastfeed past a few months. My choices I make<br/>\n&gt; informed and I makes choices that will best suit my family and our<br/>\n&gt; situation but when the rest of the world goes along it is hard to keep<br/>\n&gt; the beat of your own drum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really don&#39;t know what my point is. *L*  Gee maybe that is my problem.<br/>\n&gt; (Or I need some sleep.) I guess I just need to get it off my chest I<br/>\n&gt; sort of feel like  at times I am going against the grain and wonder how<br/>\n&gt; my kids will turn out and if I am doing the right thing. I am glad this<br/>\n&gt; list is here. At least I can read there are really other families out<br/>\n&gt; there with similar ideas and ways of doing things as we do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shelly<br/>\n&gt; mom to 5<br/>\n&gt; Connecticut<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 31 Jan 2001 18:28:07 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: raising dogs & pro-life<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/31/01 12:45:28 PM Mountain Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:squeaksoup@...\">squeaksoup@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Many Catholics (most) use birth control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m guessing when you wrote &quot;(most)&quot; you meant Americans of your<br/>\n&gt; acquaintance.

How bout them Blazers Huh?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Nancy - I have fibromyalgia, and I would say the main symptoms are pain<br/>\n&gt; and insomnia.  There&#39;s also migraines, dropping things, poor memory and word<br/>\n&gt; recall, irritable bowel syndrome, flu-like achiness,  missing your mouth<br/>\n&gt; when you try to drink, swelling in hands, and difficulty shaking a virus.<br/>\n&gt; My favorite book on the subject is &quot;Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain<br/>\n&gt; Syndrome&quot; by Devin Starlanyl and Mary Ellen Copeland.  I know they have a<br/>\n&gt; website too.    There is a LOT of misinformation out there, and I really<br/>\n&gt; think it&#39;s just a word used to describe something that doctors haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; figured out yet.  They do know that I have candida (too much yeast in the<br/>\n&gt; intestines) and some minor food allergies, but that doesn&#39;t really explain<br/>\n&gt; most of the symptoms.   I was diagnosed in 1991, and every doctor I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt; to in the past ten years has heard of it, but not every one has taken it<br/>\n&gt; seriously or known a lot about it.  Unfortunately, I have not found much<br/>\n&gt; relief, and have tried many medications and therapies.  I would recommend<br/>\n&gt; seeing an osteopath, as they seem to be able to feel where your pain is and<br/>\n&gt; provide some massage therapy.   I would also go to as many doctors as it<br/>\n&gt; takes until you are listened too.   My life is profoundly affected, as you<br/>\n&gt; said, but you do learn to deal with it.   If you have any specific questions<br/>\n&gt; about it I&#39;ll be happy to answer them.  I hope you don&#39;t have it! - Rue<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: DiamondAir [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondair@...\">diamondair@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 31, 2001 1:04 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] FMS and multiple allergies, was Say...

I<br/>\n&gt; know this topic has been discussed before, but I need help.  A good friend<br/>\n&gt; is telling me to look into FMS, as she thinks I am a prime candidate for<br/>\n&gt; such a diagnosis.  I really am starting to feel like some kind of<br/>\n&gt; hypochondriac because I always seem to be sick.  So educate me about FMS,<br/>\n&gt; what are key symptoms, and would my family doc even know what it is?  I am<br/>\n&gt; really finding that my life is profoundly affected by my consistently poor<br/>\n&gt; health, even more so that it always was as a child, since I have kids of my<br/>\n&gt; own to care for now and just cannot be sick this much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, my son has multiple allergy issues, as many of you may know, since<br/>\n&gt; we have discussed allergies before too.  He just turned four in December and<br/>\n&gt; I have been avoiding intrusive allergy tests because I did not want to put a<br/>\n&gt; young child through a lot of torture over them.  Now I am thinking, for his<br/>\n&gt; own safety, I need to get in to see an allergist and have some comprehensive<br/>\n&gt; testing done on him, as well as myself.  Any advice from parents of allergic<br/>\n&gt; and special medical needs children?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nanci,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve mentioned it on this list before, but I think it&#39;s important enough to<br/>\n&gt; repeat. I seriously suggest looking into NAET treatments, both for allergies<br/>\n&gt; and FMS. You can read about it at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naet.com\">http://www.naet.com</a> . But keep an open<br/>\n&gt; mind. When I first heard about it, and indeed when I first took my son in to<br/>\n&gt; be treated, it just seemed totally hokey and impossible to me. But it<br/>\n&gt; really, really works! When I took my son in for his first NAET treatment, he<br/>\n&gt; had endured 4 months of hives due to food allergies that we couldn&#39;t pin<br/>\n&gt; down. He had been to pediatricians and allergists, poked with needles for<br/>\n&gt; allergy tests that were inconclusive and told us nothing. The best that the<br/>\n&gt; doctors and allergists could come up with was a prescription for long-term<br/>\n&gt; Claritin use and an Epipen just in case he went in to anaphylactic shock.<br/>\n&gt; That and a diet that avoided just about everything edible on earth. We<br/>\n&gt; existed on Millet bread and rice cheese for months before I found NAET. When<br/>\n&gt; I took him in for his first treatment, I didn&#39;t give him any antihistamines<br/>\n&gt; that morning, because I thought it might interfere. By the time his<br/>\n&gt; appointment rolled around, he was covered in huge welty hives from head to<br/>\n&gt; toe, and his face and hands were swelling up. Within literally minutes of<br/>\n&gt; the start of the NAET treatment, the hives started disappearing before my<br/>\n&gt; very eyes. They came back for about 5 hours after his 2nd NAET treatment and<br/>\n&gt; have not been back since! So far we have had him &quot;cleared&quot; of 5 of his food<br/>\n&gt; allergies and are eating all kinds of things we hadn&#39;t eaten in months. I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t describe how happy I am not to see my little guy swollen up, itching,<br/>\n&gt; and covered in hives. Not to mention eating Quinoa pasta (blech!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A friend of mine&#39;s mother had fibromalgyia and Crohn&#39;s disease, and was<br/>\n&gt; basically debilitated by pain. The doctors kept giving her different kinds<br/>\n&gt; of medications, but nothing worked. She was taking dozens of ibuprofen a<br/>\n&gt; day. Her remission after NAET treatments has left her able to totally enjoy<br/>\n&gt; life. She&#39;s not completely free of all of her symptoms, but enough that she<br/>\n&gt; feels she has &quot;a completely different body&quot;. I can&#39;t say enough about this<br/>\n&gt; amazing treatment. Best of all, for kids, it is completely painless.<br/>\n&gt; Mackenzie actually looks forward to going to see &quot;Doctor Deborah&quot;, the<br/>\n&gt; naturopath who has been doing our NAET treatments. Often chiropractors,<br/>\n&gt; acupuncturists, or naturopaths become NAET specialists, so you might try<br/>\n&gt; looking in the phone book under these professions to see if you can find<br/>\n&gt; someone who does it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this info is helpful. I know I might sound like I&#39;m proselytizing about<br/>\n&gt; it, but if I can help one family avoid the horrible allergy problems we had,<br/>\n&gt; and the lack of useful treatment from allopathic physicians, the elimination<br/>\n&gt; diets and the medications, it is worth it!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, NAET is also used to treat Sensory Integration problems, Autism, and<br/>\n&gt; many other allergy-related illnesses. The woman who created NAET, Dr.<br/>\n&gt; Nambudriped has written a couple of books &quot;Say Goodbye to Illness&quot; and &quot;Say<br/>\n&gt; Goodbye to Allergy-Related Autism&quot; that might be worth checking out for<br/>\n&gt; anyone interested in how it works.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Blue Skies!<br/>\n&gt;    -Robin-<br/>\n&gt; Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I want to grow up to be a nun, because I love to<br/>\n&gt; sing&quot; (can you tell we just watched the &quot;Sound of Music&quot;??)<br/>\n&gt; and Asa (10/5/99) &quot;More get doggies happy be!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 01 Feb 2001 00:18:26<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Bonnie Painter&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonniepainter@...\">bonniepainter@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Sports<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like hockey, but I&#39;m a Philadelphia Flyers fan.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bonnie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: Kerry Kibort &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kkibort@...\">kkibort@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Sports<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 31 Jan 2001 05:29:26 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyone wanna talk sports???<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My family is BIG into hockey.

I think it takes great<br/>\n&gt; courage to go against the grain...most leaders, artists and historical<br/>\n&gt; figures became who they were because they had the courage to stand alone<br/>\n&gt; and be unique.

You can say that you are pro-life but agree that our laws<br/>\n&gt; &gt;should be pro-choice. I think there are many people out there with this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;view.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That would mean that you are personally against it but don&#39;t feel it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;right to make the choice for other woman. If you want abortion banned, then<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you obviously trying to push your views on to other women. There is no way<br/>\n&gt; &gt;around it. My solution: if you don&#39;t want to have an abortion, don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one. Why can&#39;t it be that simple?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In addition, you can&#39;t possibly believe that most people with prolife<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophy act like the screaming nuts in front of clinics.
