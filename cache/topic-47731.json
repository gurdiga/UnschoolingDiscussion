( I am not talking about spanking....I don&#39;t think that is appropriate in ANY situation.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is one of those who has to be more cautious than others.   She has cried numerous times in disgust because she isn&#39;t able to perform some trick or stunt that others can do without getting injured.  She&#39;s not had any broken bones herself thankfully, but many, many scrapes and boo boos.  She doesn&#39;t even want to think about taking off the training wheels on her bike.  She will be 7 in  a few weeks.  My son was 4 and was/is a daredevil of sorts.  Each child is so different.  Thanks for giving me another viewpoint to think about.  It makes it even more difficult to decide when to speak up for a child and when to just keep my trap shut................<br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47564,"nextTopicId":47785}}
