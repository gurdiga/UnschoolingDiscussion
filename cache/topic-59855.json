It&#39;s okay to forgive yourself and move up into this moment, where life <br/>\nis unfolding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am not trying to whine, but being around someone all day long who fights <br/>\n&gt;&gt;me, would disagree the sky was blue just because mom said it...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...is like being around a hormonal teenager, a feisty 3 year old, a PMS mom? <br/>\n;-) I DO understand and am not trying to dismiss your feelings. But you&#39;ve <br/>\ngot to remember that it&#39;s really not so much about you as it is about your <br/>\ndaughter. It&#39;s about where she is and her moods and her natural disposition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;gets emotional and blames me for all her problems,&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would be open to what seem to be reasonable complaints and let the rest <br/>\njust flow on by.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;says she hates homeschooling just to try to hurt me&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nah. Maybe she does hate homeschooling right now, but I&#39;d suspect she&#39;s <br/>\ntrying to get a reaction or venting, not trying to hurt you. It&#39;s not about <br/>\nyou. It&#39;s about your daughter reacting to something new and different. <br/>\nChange is hard, even a change for the better. She sounds like she just needs <br/>\nmore room than most to figure it all out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I subject myself to this daily for a kid who doesn&#39;t appreciate it!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard sometimes, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to expect kids to <br/>\nshow appreciation for our parenting. For them, it&#39;s just life. They don&#39;t <br/>\nhave the awful parenting we know about to compare it to. I think it&#39;s a good <br/>\nthing that they take our goodness for granted sometimes.

Try to focus on the parts of her <br/>\nthat you like right now. Keep that as your focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We have two younger children and I feel guilty that I can&#39;t be more for <br/>\n&gt;&gt;her.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guilt is a useless emotion. It does nothing to move us towards a better <br/>\nlife. Do what you can, live each moment as you are able.
