Confused<br/>\nyet &lt;g&gt;  Well, I am talking about millions of dollars spent each year on<br/>\nNational Genocide Day!  I&#39;m talking about the free use of public buildings<br/>\nfor groups to celebrate National Genocide Day in.  I&#39;m talking about all<br/>\nthose folks who get a paid holiday (most at the tax payers&#39; expense) for<br/>\nNational Genocide Day.  I am talking about folks such as those in Boulder,<br/>\nCO who agreed to change the name of their parade to signify that it was a<br/>\nheritage parade instead of a celebration of a mass murderer and who as of<br/>\nyesterday changed their mind and stated they were proud of their own<br/>\npersonal Hitler.  I leave you to ruminate over the following news release:<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n===============<br/>\n&quot;    Our we as American citizens so blind to the truth of Columbus that we<br/>\nallow our tax dollars to pay for a national holiday for a mass murderer,<br/>\nkidnapper, enslaver and a thief? As a member of the Cherokee Nation of<br/>\nOklahoma, with Italian heritage myself, I take no pride in my Italian<br/>\nheritage in this country. When you look at the millions of tax dollars that<br/>\nhave been spent on fighting organized crime in this country and countless<br/>\ntelevision shows glorifying Italian mobsters and then my tax dollars paying<br/>\nfor<br/>\nColumbus Day, this is a National Sick Joke!<br/>\n<br/>\n    The Italian community in this country needs to wake up to their overall<br/>\ndirt bag, low life image. you can view this image weekly on HBO with your<br/>\nfamily. The Italian community is not protesting the image of them that is<br/>\nbeing portrayed in television and movies. Columbus is the Hitler of<br/>\nAmerica!<br/>\n<br/>\n    It is another National sick joke, that of all the Federal holidays on<br/>\nthe books, not one of them recognize or pay tribute to the American<br/>\nIndians.<br/>\nThe so called founding fathers of this country brought about the Federal<br/>\nGovernment using Indian Government as a guide. Freedom of speech,<br/>\nseparation<br/>\nof Governmental powers and Federalism was achieved by observing Indian<br/>\nGovernments. It did not come from Europe, Africa, Middle east or Asia.<br/>\n<br/>\n    There is not one group of people in this country that have suffered or<br/>\nendured any more hardship than the American Indians, nor any race of people<br/>\non the face of this planet. Slavery around the world and human genocide in<br/>\nworld war two is one thing, but the Indians have endured five centuries of<br/>\ngenocide and wars fighting for their homeland to live in peace. With all<br/>\nthat this great Nation of America has today, came from the American Indians<br/>\nhomeland at the expense of the worlds longest holocaust against the Indian<br/>\nrace.<br/>\n<br/>\n    With all the support that the American Indians have given to the<br/>\nFederal<br/>\nand State Governments in the forming of this Country, we should not have to<br/>\nask for a national holiday. Our ancestors helped the Federal Government<br/>\ncome<br/>\nabout and achieve it&#39;s independence July 4th 1776, we have Thanksgiving Day<br/>\nbecause of the American Indians and countless more contributions.<br/>\n<br/>\n    African Americans have proclaimed the confederate flag raciest and<br/>\nshould be taken out of schools and public buildings. Not one word in the<br/>\nnational news media is said about what the American Indians endured under<br/>\nthe United States flag. My question to America is why is the plight of one<br/>\ngroup of people in this country more important to correct and make amends<br/>\nfor what was done to them and completely ignore what was done to the<br/>\noriginal inhabitants of this land?<br/>\n<br/>\n    United Native America is calling on all Americans to make this country<br/>\nface up to the inhuman acts committed against the American Indian people.<br/>\nIt<br/>\nis time for the genocide of American Indians to stop now, along with the<br/>\nracial exclusion of them in our society today. The Congressional Indian<br/>\nCaucus in Washington DC. is drafting a national holiday bill at this time<br/>\nto<br/>\nbring before Congress after the first of next year, there number is<br/>\n202-225-3611 ask for Kimberly Teehee or contact JD Hayworth of Arizona,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jdhayworth@...\">jdhayworth@...</a>, for holiday information on the Internet go to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mytwobeadsworth.freeservers.com/TurtleIsland3html\">http://mytwobeadsworth.freeservers.com/TurtleIsland3html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.skynet.be/kola/index.htm\">http://users.skynet.be/kola/index.htm</a> email petition, click on holiday<br/>\nbanner<br/>\n<br/>\nFounder United Native America<br/>\nMike L.
