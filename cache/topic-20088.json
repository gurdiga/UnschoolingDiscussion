I find that SO much sexism still exists today <br/>\nwith regard to housework.  No matter who we get together with, it seems like <br/>\nthe women are in the kitchen doing the food preparation and the men are <br/>\nsitting around talking or watching TV.  If it&#39;s a barbecue, then for some <br/>\nreason, the men can stand around it and flip stuff over but the women still <br/>\nhave to bring together the meal as a whole.<br/>\n     My husband is almost always in the kitchen with me helping and my sons <br/>\nare often in there, also.  Many people we know actually feel sort of sorry <br/>\nfor him because he does things like cook or wash dishes (as evidenced by <br/>\ncomments like, poor Matt...).  Or they act like it&#39;s extraordinarily generous <br/>\nof him to help with these things by saying things like, WOW, that&#39;s so great <br/>\nthat he COOKS.  I know it&#39;s supposed to be a compliment to him but sometimes <br/>\nI think, why aren&#39;t they saying to him, WOW, that&#39;s so great that Lucy <br/>\nCOOKS...And women do it as much or more than the men do.  <br/>\n     My kids help with every single aspect of keeping things going in this <br/>\nhouse and the three oldest have all changed diapers quite a lot, too, when <br/>\nthe situation called for it.  I figure maybe their marriages and families <br/>\nwill be a lot healthier because of this.  At least we&#39;re sending out five men <br/>\ninto society who don&#39;t have that form of sexism.<br/>\n<br/>\n         Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20380,"nextTopicId":20203}}
