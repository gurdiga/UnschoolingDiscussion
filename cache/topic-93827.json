We have one main park day that <br/>\nwe absolutely don&#39;t miss!  We&#39;ve added a second one because my son <br/>\nwanted to do more with kids at the park - once a week wasn&#39;t enough <br/>\nfor him.    <br/>\n<br/>\nField trips - animal shelter, museums, auto body shop.  What&#39;s he <br/>\ninto?  There are lots of places that aren&#39;t really seen as field <br/>\ntrip opportunities - auto body shop for example.  :) What kind of <br/>\nplace would he be interested in?  Just call the places.  Somebody <br/>\nwill usually be willing to show you around.  If not, call another.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlan a day trip together.  I don&#39;t know where you are, so can&#39;t come <br/>\nup with specific ideas.  One thing that we liked to do, and havent&#39; <br/>\nin a while (I&#39;ll need to consult with the kids and see if they&#39;re <br/>\ngame) was to get up before sunrise and hit the beach ...then sit <br/>\nthere and watch the sun come up.

We jump in the car and go for a drive.  We make some sandwiches<br/>\nand go for a picnic.  We grab our day packs and go for a hike.  We pick<br/>\nup some corn and go to the park to feed the geese. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a small town that until just recently didn&#39;t even have a<br/>\nbookstore.   Lots of the interesting things we do are in other towns.  <br/>\nSometimes we just drive to an art gallery or museum we&#39;ve never been to,<br/>\nor haven&#39;t been to in a long time.   Sometimes we find a used book store<br/>\nwe&#39;ve never been to.  Sometimes we go to a restaurant we&#39;ve never been to<br/>\nbefore and order the weirdest sounding thing from the menu.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we stopped in place where they make neon signs and asked for a tour.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\nSometimes we go to the greenhouse and play in the earthworm beds. <br/>\nSometimes we go to the cemetery and do gravestone rubbings.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the winter we can go to the sledding hill, just two blocks away.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s snowing here today, that&#39;s what made me think of sledding. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks ago we went to look for sapphires.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think parents need to be open to all the possibilities.  There was<br/>\nrecently a post, asking if the child really understood he could do<br/>\nanything.  That&#39;s important but what&#39;s more important (because often kids<br/>\ncan&#39;t drive themselves to interesting places) is that the parents are<br/>\naware that the world is bigger than their own house or yard or library.  <br/>\nParents need to be imaginative, spontaneous and excitable. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nAsking a kid who&#39;s bored what he wants to do really doesn&#39;t help.   If he<br/>\nknew what he wanted he could do it.  Getting active and doing something<br/>\nnew revives creativity.   I always think of those times as an opportunity<br/>\nfor us to step out of the box and make discoveries.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
