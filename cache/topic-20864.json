The past few days have been one post after another<br/>\n&gt; hammering the same subject.  Most, if not all, of us have thrown in our two<br/>\n&gt; cents.

I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re a newbie to<br/>\nmailing lists in general or just this one, but you&#39;ll start to recognize the<br/>\ncycles that mailing lists MUST go through. People have to keep going until<br/>\nthey&#39;re done. If you or I are done with the topic, we just have to use our<br/>\ndelete key and some patience. :) It would be a real shocker if the spanking<br/>\ndiscussion/debate persisted longer than a week. By then, even the most<br/>\npassionate have had enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathe in. Go plant some flowers. If it&#39;s making you insane, just delete<br/>\nall the mail for 7 days and come back, I guarantee the topic will have moved<br/>\non. Of course, it will come back again, like an annoying relative, at<br/>\nregular intervals. The quicker we accept this is so, the less we have to<br/>\nfuss and stress over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo sarcasm or irritability intended,<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20365,"nextTopicId":20838}}
