","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1791280688\">Hi all,<br/>\n     I was a regular poster a few months back (although I tend to read more <br/>\nthan post, unless I feel like I have something important to contribute).  <br/>\nHowever, life got a little crazy, so I backed off some on all my lists.  I <br/>\njust can&#39;t seem to stay away for long however :-)<br/>\n     Anyway, my name is Tammy, and my family has been unschooling for six <br/>\nyears.<br/>\nI have a 19 year old son (who is planning to go away to college in the fall), <br/>\na 15 year old son, a 12 year old son, and a 9 year old daughter.  <br/>\n     We have really loved unschooling.  Things have changed alot this year <br/>\nthough, as my 19 year old son decided to take some classes at a technical <br/>\nschool before starting college next year, any my 15 year old son decided to <br/>\ngo to public school for his freshman year.  So this was the first year that <br/>\nonly my youngest two were home with me.  I kept begging my 15 year old to <br/>\ncome back home, but he likes all the social aspects of public school (mostly <br/>\nthe girls!).  So, I am trying to back off and not miss him so much, but it <br/>\ncan really be hard.   Next year will be worse, however, since my oldest will <br/>\nbe going to college a few hours drive from home  :-(<br/>\n   It has been interesting to watch my oldest go from unschooling to college. <br/>\n I can&#39;t believe how motivated he can be to get himself up for school <br/>\neveryday.  I used to worry some that he would never get himself up in the <br/>\nmorning.  We are radical unschoolers, so I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; my kids do any type <br/>\nof schoolwork, or stick to a schedule for sleeping or rising either.  Brandon <br/>\n(the 19 year old) used to stay up to about 2 or 3 am every night and sleep <br/>\nuntil 1 or 2in the afternoon.  Usually, that didn&#39;t bother me, but my dh and <br/>\nmy parents were convinced that he would never be able to make himself get up <br/>\nfor his &quot;real life&quot; after school.  It is great to be able to say that they <br/>\nare wrong about that!  I never have to make him or his 15 year old brother <br/>\nget up for school or work.  They do it all on their own!   And I have to <br/>\nadmit that I sure didn&#39;t when I was their age!   After I finally graduated <br/>\nschool and moved out on my own, I was horrible about getting up and going to <br/>\nwork!  They have more discipline and motivation than I did, and my parents <br/>\nwere very, very strict with me!  Anyway, it is great to see unschooling <br/>\nworking!!!!!   <br/>\n    <br/>\nTammy in IN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21780,"nextTopicId":22206}}
