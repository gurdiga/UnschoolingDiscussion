Last year, Rosie went to a 10 week <br/>\nsummer Japanese language and culture activity - once a week for half days. <br/>\nShe LOVED it. Her friends go there every Saturday during the school year, for <br/>\nJapanese language instruction and Rosie would love to go, but she also loves <br/>\nsoccer and her games are always on Saturday mornings, too. During the summer, <br/>\nthey do just a little language instruction and more cultural-awareness <br/>\nactivities. This is run by the Japanese Center - it is really intended for <br/>\nchildren of Japanese families living in the US or Japanese-American kids, but <br/>\nthey fully welcome my daughter even though we aren&#39;t Japanese. She&#39;s planning <br/>\nto go again this year and has had her materials out, going over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie&#39;s sister, Roxana, is 14 and has been learning Norwegian, on her own <br/>\nbecause finding a Norwegian tutor has turned out to be impossible, so far. <br/>\nShe has a very close online friend who is Norwegian - that&#39;s where the <br/>\ninterest started. But she&#39;s ALWAYS loved Norse mythology, too. Roxana has a <br/>\nreal talent for languages and wants to take a foreign language class at the <br/>\ncommunity college in the fall - she wanted German or Italian (she&#39;s an opera <br/>\nbuff), but our little college teaches only French, Spanish, Chinese and <br/>\nJapanese. So I don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll do. If anybody has any ideas about how <br/>\nto find a Norwegian tutor, I&#39;d like to hear them. There are not a lot of <br/>\nNorwegians around in Southern California.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, who is Iranian, is bewildered by the interest in Japanese and <br/>\nNorwegian. He can&#39;t see why the kids aren&#39;t more interested in learning <br/>\neither Spanish (which is the dominant language in our area) or Persian <br/>\n(Farsi), which is his own language.  Any suggestions for how to explain to <br/>\nhim that there is good reason NOT to dissuade the kids from their OWN <br/>\ninterests in choosing to learn a foreign language?<br/>\n<br/>\npamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pokemon & Japanese","postDate":"1022334707","msgId":37424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5MTUwRjMzLjkwRDMlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNi5lNDk1YzZmLjJhMWZmODZmQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37389,"nextInTopic":37431,"prevInTime":37423,"nextInTime":37425,"topicId":37389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s used for foreign words and -- guessing from Pokemon<br/>\nnames! -- made up words too. (Though the Japanese names include lots of<br/>\nforeign references.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, to use the spreadsheet he&#39;d need to know it anyway. The program is more<br/>\nof a way to double check if we&#39;re translating properly and a way to write<br/>\nkana so my daughter can cut and paste it into something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good book that has just the kanas is Kana Pict-o-Graphix<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1880656183/qid=1022332686/sr=1-2/ref=\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1880656183/qid=1022332686/sr=1-2/ref=</a><br/>\nsr_1_2/002-9667572-1150460<br/>\n<br/>\nby Michael Rowley. Each page has one syllable and the corresponding hiragana<br/>\nand katakana. But the best thing is that he turns each symbol into a picture<br/>\nthat relates to the sound it makes. So he&#39;s turned the hiragana symbol for<br/>\n&quot;to&quot; into a toe with a thorn in it and the katakana into a bird&#39;s toe. He&#39;s<br/>\na book designer and illustrator (who studied Japanese in Japan) so his<br/>\nillustrations are just right :-) It&#39;s pricey for such a tiny thing at $6 but<br/>\nwe&#39;ve used it loads. (Of course being tiny it&#39;s easily lost too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHis Kanji Pict-o-Graphix<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962813702/qid=1022332686/sr=1-1/ref=\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962813702/qid=1022332686/sr=1-1/ref=</a><br/>\nsr_1_1/002-9667572-1150460<br/>\n<br/>\ndoes the same for Kanji. He has over 1000 kanji grouped by common graphic<br/>\nelements. So on one page are 7 kanji that include the kanji for sun. Each<br/>\nchanges the kanji into a picture that relates to its meaning. So the kanji<br/>\nthat means clear, bright has a sun and a candle (that looks like the bottom<br/>\npart of the kanji) and a sentence &quot;The sun and candle shine clear and bright<br/>\nlight.&quot; At the beginning of the book he also includes that graphics for the<br/>\nkana. (Some are different than in his Kana Pict-o-Graphix.) You don&#39;t really<br/>\nneed both if you get the Kanji Pict-o-Graphix.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he wanted to go beyond those Kanji, there&#39;s Remembering the Kanji: A<br/>\ncomplete course on how not to forget the meaning and writing of Japanese<br/>\ncharacters by James W. Heisig. It&#39;s a lot more wordy and takes more effort<br/>\nbut the stories and mnemonics can be effective.
