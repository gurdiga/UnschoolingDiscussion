Not sure if that&#39;s exactly what you were looking for, but your post reminded me of the conversations these characters/stories have sparked for us about &quot;good guys,&quot; &quot;bad guys,&quot; and all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Incredible Hulk is the hero character but quite destructive.  The movie may be a bit intense but there are cartoons, books, and comic books geared toward younger kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe two Spiderman movies explore ideas about the choice to be a &quot;good guy&quot; versus to be a &quot;bad guy&quot;.  The dilemnas and choices that the villain has to make parallell those of  Peter Parker/Spiderman throughout the stories, obviously with one ending up the hero and the other the bad guy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot as familiar with X-men, but I think this is true for several of those characters, too -- choosing to do good things vs. harmful things with their powers/questions of what actually is the &quot;good&quot; thing to do versus what actually is the &quot;harmful&quot; choice -- and how that can depend on perspective.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.insightbb.com/~simpson.fam\">http://home.insightbb.com/~simpson.fam</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mfhickman@...\">mfhickman@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 05, 2005 1:47 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the darkside and a strewing story<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Riley wants to know about stories where the &quot;bad guy&quot; wins.
