Okay, I think it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been at least 2 weeks (I hope it&#39;s been that long)that I posted here<br/>\n&gt; and got some great advice - the main thing being to just say school<br/>\n&gt; is done for the year, no more me asking her every day what she wants<br/>\n&gt; to do, filling her backpack with things to do while I work - to just<br/>\n&gt; back off!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Since then, my daughter has LIVED on the computer, she discovered a<br/>\n&gt; new game and the normal routine is for her to stay up until 2am,<br/>\n&gt; watch Roseanne until 3am, read a little bit  and probably fall asleep<br/>\n&gt; by 4am or so.  She&#39;ll sleep in until anywhere between 2-3pm in the<br/>\n&gt; afternoon when all her friends get home from school then she&#39;s on the<br/>\n&gt; phone and playing this new game on the computer.  We are talking 11<br/>\n&gt; hours on the computer most days.  This new schedule has stopped her<br/>\n&gt; going to chorus at school, she missed the last two art classes<br/>\n&gt; through our homeschool co-op which she liked going to but today was<br/>\n&gt; the last one and she didn&#39;t want to get up for it. I&#39;m going to work<br/>\n&gt; for a couple of hours in the morning which is okay I guess although<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s a little nervous about staying home alone so if she was awake<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;d be nervous. I also know this new schedule makes it impossible<br/>\n&gt; for me to keep certain scheduled appointments so I&#39;m having to cancel<br/>\n&gt; appointments and reschedule.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Her cousins are coming to stay with us for 8 weeks this summer and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love to be able to take everyone to the park, beach, library<br/>\n&gt; etc... but I&#39;m afraid that if I don&#39;t limit her computer time, she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; not be starting her day until 3pm in the afternoon and her two<br/>\n&gt; cousins will have been waiting around all day for her - she&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; easy to wake up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This just seems like she&#39;s living a total seperate life than everyone<br/>\n&gt; else.  She expressed an interest in a few 4H projects and earning the<br/>\n&gt; Girl Scout Silver Award so we bought several books etc... for these<br/>\n&gt; two things and she did a little until I backed off and now she&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; on the computer.  I haven&#39;t mentioned them but I&#39;ve got the 4H leader<br/>\n&gt; and people in our girl scout troop wanting her to come work with them<br/>\n&gt; on different things and now she doesn&#39;t seem interested anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess I&#39;m a bad parent, I am just having serious doubts that she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; get tired of the computer and want to do anything else.  We&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; problems for 2 years with her &quot;obsession&quot; with the computer - this<br/>\n&gt; caused a lot of problems when she was in school and had homework to<br/>\n&gt; do.....I&#39;m trying to look at it as the computer is her passion and<br/>\n&gt; who knows where that could lead and she&#39;s been saying she wants to<br/>\n&gt; create computer security systems for banks - that&#39;s great but how is<br/>\n&gt; playing this game related to that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AHHHHHH!!!!<br/>\n&gt; Tracie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2005 20:44:26 -0000<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Are you guys sure this is going to work???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;greencow32766&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;McGeath3@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get tired of the computer and want to do anything else.

Ever had anyone tell you you *can&#39;t* have<br/>\n&gt; something (M&Ms, cookies, a bubble bath, whatever) until...? And you<br/>\n&gt; spent all that time thinking about it most likely and counting<br/>\n&gt; minutes until you could... And you counted and grabbed those M&Ms as<br/>\n&gt; quickly and as many as you could manage before they were again<br/>\n&gt; restricted. Same thing she&#39;s doing right now. And it&#39;s only been a<br/>\n&gt; short time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Flip side is that there may be things that cannot be rescheduled<br/>\n&gt; without cost or pain. That&#39;s when you two sit down and figure out a<br/>\n&gt; compromise - you need her to be able to get up in the morning, she<br/>\n&gt; wants to play this game and whatall, is she willing to be home by<br/>\n&gt; herself (if she&#39;s old enough), all that stuff. Talk it out- LOTS of<br/>\n&gt; talk. If there&#39;s one big common denominator I&#39;ve seen in all<br/>\n&gt; unschooling households is lots of TALK, for fun, for information,<br/>\n&gt; for connection, for arriving at compromise to keep the *family*<br/>\n&gt; running relatively smoothly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As far as the &quot;other people&quot;, again, sit down and discuss with her<br/>\n&gt; freely, not to &#39;get&#39; her to do these things but rather &quot;These people<br/>\n&gt; are waiting on you for this. Do we need to tell them it&#39;s on hold<br/>\n&gt; for now?&quot; (not worded well but you get the gist).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cousin-wise, get her involved in the planning for their visit - she<br/>\n&gt; might use the Internet to find interesting things to do for the time<br/>\n&gt; they are in town, for example. Have her type up and print out a<br/>\n&gt; list. USE her computer skills to make things fun for all. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; possible that by the time they arrive (if they&#39;re in school they<br/>\n&gt; likely won&#39;t be there for at least a month from now or longer), she<br/>\n&gt; might have eaten her fill on this game and be willing to ease back<br/>\n&gt; some.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Deb<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2005 20:50:05 -0000<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: New to List and a question about Arizona<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brenda&quot; &lt;lvmydd@h...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  It&#39;s important for me to live in a &quot;low regualation&quot; state.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, so (1) no tornadoes (2) unschoolers (3) easy legal climate (4)<br/>\n&gt; work at home<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey move to Connecticut!

I guess part of me feels<br/>\n&gt; like I have these two really good friends that I love dearly, but<br/>\n&gt; that don&#39;t get along, LOL.  It isn&#39;t causing a problem for either of<br/>\n&gt; them, but it bugs me! (and, I mean this in a mild and lighthearted<br/>\n&gt; way)  It mystifies me because I see so much good in each of them, and<br/>\n&gt; in my eyes they are so alike and ought to be great friends.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My interest in TCS/NCP is what led me to unschooling.  And, in my<br/>\n&gt; view the discussions I read in radical unschooling forums are quite<br/>\n&gt; simply the practical application of NCP.  Ah well....I don&#39;t know who<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to sell on this, LOL....I&#39;ll just continue to take the<br/>\n&gt; good I get from each and be thankful to all!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carolyn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s.

Because there CAN be unschooling in a family <br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt; kids also have chores and bedtimes and have to clean their plates. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; personally think it will have the depth or benefit, ultimately, as a house <br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt; the children&#39;s preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it could <br/>\n&gt; still<br/>\n&gt; absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; I think this is a good point, and something I had been wondering  about. <br/>\n&gt; We<br/>\n&gt; have unschooled for the past five years. My children had no assigned <br/>\n&gt; academic<br/>\n&gt; work; no TV, computer, or video game rules; and in general did what  they<br/>\n&gt; wanted to when they wanted to. But they did have chores, and they did <br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; regular meal and snack times and no food in between, and they did have <br/>\n&gt; bedtimes.<br/>\n&gt; On the other hand, after being on this list for only a few days, I started<br/>\n&gt; to get the point of doing away with bedtimes, food control, and chores. I <br/>\n&gt; saw<br/>\n&gt; the whole picture and respect my children a lot more because of it. We no<br/>\n&gt; longer have assigned chores and surprise, surprise, my children often are<br/>\n&gt; willing to help out anyways. We no longer have any food controls, and I <br/>\n&gt; ask my<br/>\n&gt; children what they would like before I go to the grocery store, and <br/>\n&gt; believe it  or<br/>\n&gt; not, I think they eat healthier than before. We no longer have bedtimes, <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; the kids do stay up a lot later than they used to, and they&#39;re sometimes <br/>\n&gt; too<br/>\n&gt; noisy even when I tell them that I&#39;m trying to rest, but this is still new<br/>\n&gt; to them, and I think they&#39;ll settle down after a while when they trust the<br/>\n&gt; situation more.<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s great that all these topics were discussed on this list. This<br/>\n&gt; is a great place for other unschoolers like myself to see that there can <br/>\n&gt; be so<br/>\n&gt; much more to unschooling than just not doing formal academics.<br/>\n&gt; Jacqueline (Ivorygrace7...)  ========<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 11<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2005 19:43:06 EDT<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Not really unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/27/2005 11:47:11 AM Mountain Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey - maybe that&#39;s the term we need - &quot;Whole Life  Unschooling.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How about just Whole Unschooling<br/>\n&gt; Whole Unschoolers<br/>\n&gt; Wholly Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Version of whole.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or Really Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Real Unschoolers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2005 19:51:30 -0400<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Jason & Stephanie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thesixofus@...\">thesixofus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Not really unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  How about just Whole Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;  Whole Unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;  Wholly Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Version of whole.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Or Really Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Real Unschoolers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ****I&#39;ve used the terms whole life unschoolers, complete unschoolers  and <br/>\n&gt; total unschoolers  recently, I also say *real* :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Stephanie in PA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2005 19:53:12 -0400<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Jason & Stephanie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thesixofus@...\">thesixofus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Not really unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;I like Pam&#39;s &quot;Whole Life Unschoolers.&quot;  Earlier today I was writing <br/>\n&gt; and used<br/>\n&gt;  the words &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;total&quot; unschoolers to try and get the same <br/>\n&gt; meaning.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  ****I just realized I said the same thing you did in my last post &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I can see how &quot;radical&quot; was used in the past to differentiate from <br/>\n&gt; &quot;partial<br/>\n&gt;  unschoolers,&quot; but I think of &quot;radical unschooling&quot; as being inclusive of <br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt;  aspects of life.

We<br/>\n&gt; fought over time and continuously had to compromise.  Someone was on<br/>\n&gt; the computer at every moment with sleep schedules staggered to squeeze<br/>\n&gt; out every second of computer time.  No one thought they had enough.<br/>\n&gt; Were we exploring all the wonderful information available here?  Not<br/>\n&gt; really, the kids mostly played Neopets, and I mostly read email lists<br/>\n&gt; especially this one.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do we still do that?  No.  Eventually our interests moved on and now<br/>\n&gt; my 7 and 11 yo dd&#39;s rarely use the computer.  I could just see a more<br/>\n&gt; traditionally inclined parent trying to limit them back then and now<br/>\n&gt; forcing them, lol!  I still use the computer about 8 hours a day, but<br/>\n&gt; for a wide variety of things.  My 11 yo ds and 8 yo dd use it<br/>\n&gt; regularly for email, a few games, writing, and occasionally looking<br/>\n&gt; things up.  My 16 yo dd progressed from a few months of nothing but<br/>\n&gt; Neopets to managing several websites, doing paid graphic design work,<br/>\n&gt; writing award winning fan-fic, and keeping the entire family up on<br/>\n&gt; current events.  She also currently spends around 8 hours a day on the<br/>\n&gt; computer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t worry.  If you don&#39;t restrict her, she will find the path<br/>\n&gt; that is best for her.  Of course, if her activities are seriously<br/>\n&gt; affecting other family members in a negative way some compromise might<br/>\n&gt; be in order, not just by her but by others too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Jacqueline<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 18<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2005 21:25:30 EDT<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: a defense of the Rethinking Education conference<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This was sent directly to the people to whom it is addressed, with a copy <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; this list.<br/>\n&gt; The author joined the list specifically to send this, and so asking her to<br/>\n&gt; read for a week or two seems inappropriate, but approving a post does too. <br/>\n&gt; So<br/>\n&gt; in a compromise move, I have stripped off the quoted posts and am  sending<br/>\n&gt; the text of the message.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t need to discuss the particulars of a conference here.

First, to address <br/>\n&gt; Chris&#39;<br/>\n&gt; memory of a few years back in  which a child at the conference called 911<br/>\n&gt; (not once but twice!).  At no  point did I or other conference organizers<br/>\n&gt; explain away the seriousness of  the incident as &quot;kids will be kids&quot;.  In<br/>\n&gt; fact, as soon as police showed  up in response to the 911 call, the <br/>\n&gt; organizer<br/>\n&gt; at the microphone (we were in  the middle of our Talent Show) asked for<br/>\n&gt; parents&#39; help in finding the culprit  and resolving the problem.  Many<br/>\n&gt; parents left the room immediately to  check on their children and a young <br/>\n&gt; boy<br/>\n&gt; admitted to his father that he had  dialed 911, not having any idea that<br/>\n&gt; police would show up, much less that it  was a felony to commit this act.<br/>\n&gt; The father and mother both pulled the boy  aside and then addressed the<br/>\n&gt; audience with an apology.  After a  discussion with the police, it was<br/>\n&gt; determined that the act was not  malevolent, but innocent.  No charges <br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; filed and no further  incidents occurred.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Further, I don&#39;t have any reason to believe that a  TCS audience, child or<br/>\n&gt; family would permit a criminal, dangerous or felonious  act to be <br/>\n&gt; committed<br/>\n&gt; by their child.  Tuckerville in my estimation  misunderstands TCS <br/>\n&gt; philosophy<br/>\n&gt; when stating &quot;the child can flat out refuse to  consider anyone else&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; feelings,  needs and desires, and the parent  would be philosophy-bound <br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; to coerce them  in any way, regardless of  the direness of the situation.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; My experience and study of TCS tells me that  while it is never <br/>\n&gt; appropriate<br/>\n&gt; to coerce a child to right action, a TCS parent  would never stand by to<br/>\n&gt; witness a child engaged in activity dangerous to  himself or another.  The<br/>\n&gt; parent would be compelled to remove the child  from the situation, e.g., <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; classic argument of the child running into a  busy highway.   This is a<br/>\n&gt; crucial element of the philosophy not  often discussed, and in my personal<br/>\n&gt; experience not an issue where TCS is the  standard, consistent parenting<br/>\n&gt; model.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my experience and  study of TCS, in families where the authoritarian <br/>\n&gt; model<br/>\n&gt; of parenting is being  replaced with a TCS model, there can be quite a lot <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; fluctuation in  behavior, both from the children and the parents, as <br/>\n&gt; everyone<br/>\n&gt; struggles to  establish solidarity and reliability in communication style.<br/>\n&gt; As a parent who  has raised three children, now grown, with a TCS approach<br/>\n&gt; (although frankly I  never knew there was a label for it, now known as <br/>\n&gt; TCS),<br/>\n&gt; I can attest to the  complete lack of motive a child has to rebel or act <br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; dangerous behavior  when raised in an environment where his parents can<br/>\n&gt; ALWAYS be trusted to give  their honest opinions,  give reliable <br/>\n&gt; information<br/>\n&gt; on all subjects the  child is curious about, and both respected and <br/>\n&gt; trusted<br/>\n&gt; to make the best  decisions for both himself and others affected by his<br/>\n&gt; decisions (all TCS  tenets).  A child raised in such an atmosphere seeks <br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; parents&#39;  opinions and counsel and while he might not always follow the<br/>\n&gt; advice, he  knows his decision will be respected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been a part of discussions  and debate on TCS for years, and I<br/>\n&gt; sympathize with the difficulty in  understanding it and putting it into <br/>\n&gt; play<br/>\n&gt; - it certainly is a radical  alternative from the traditional parenting <br/>\n&gt; model<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;do what I say because I  said so&quot;.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, TCS is a<br/>\n&gt; revolutionary approach with  great promise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Thu, 28 Apr 2005 00:12:01 -0000<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;wifetovegman2002&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wifetovegman2002@...\">wifetovegman2002@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Not really unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; In a message dated 4/27/2005 11:47:11 AM Mountain Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; freeform@j... writes:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Hey - maybe that&#39;s the term we need - &quot;Whole Life  Unschooling.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ------------------<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; How about just Whole Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Whole Unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Wholly Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Version of whole.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Or Really Unschooling<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Real Unschoolers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How about Unconditional Unschooling?  ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan M (VA)<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://radicalchristianunschool.homestead.com/index.html\">http://radicalchristianunschool.homestead.com/index.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Isn&#39;t it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out<br/>\n&gt; about?

Not to mention childrenstory <br/>\n&gt; and indigentpeoplestory, or at least a mention of the last two.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What made the show especially fascinating to me was the sharing of the <br/>\n&gt; 21st century participant&#39;s views of living four months in the physical <br/>\n&gt; space of 1628. At first glance, it may seem that people wanting to break <br/>\n&gt; free from the bonds of indentured servant or women&#39;s subservience to men <br/>\n&gt; is a modern thing. However, I think that these desires have always been <br/>\n&gt; so, and it is only minor variances in society that promote big steps in <br/>\n&gt; behavioral changes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other point is that any time we consider something that can be <br/>\n&gt; categorized (this is history!), we actually experience a far greater range <br/>\n&gt; of ideas. History just means it happened previous to now. Just because it <br/>\n&gt; happened in the past doesn&#39;t mean it is limited to *history*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Serendipity comes into play as well, with this particular show leading us <br/>\n&gt; to a discussion of homosexuality, followed by Lisa&#39;s magazine subscription <br/>\n&gt; coming in the mail and containing information on the same topic. (Jonathon <br/>\n&gt; came out in episode 4 of Colonial House, and the Governor hoped his <br/>\n&gt; confession was the first step towards changing his evil ways. This led to <br/>\n&gt; a discussion about being gay and people&#39;s beliefs on homosexuality being <br/>\n&gt; something you are born with or something you choose. Later, Lisa was <br/>\n&gt; reading one of her magazines and shared the letters to the editor. <br/>\n&gt; Apparently the last issue had a quiz to help people know if they are gay <br/>\n&gt; or not. Two of the letters criticized the magazine editors for printing <br/>\n&gt; such a quiz, suggesting that young people will only become gay if they <br/>\n&gt; know it&#39;s an option. One of the letters was from a girl who had thought <br/>\n&gt; she might be gay, but after taking the quiz decided she wasn&#39;t.)  Today <br/>\n&gt; Lisa told me that she is going to attempt to create gay SIMs characters. I <br/>\n&gt; asked her how one programs their romance aspects and she explained that <br/>\n&gt; you create the family tree, so she is going to make male/male or <br/>\n&gt; female/female spouses and see what happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pat and I had also been discussing homosexuality recently because it has <br/>\n&gt; been in the national news headlines. Pat&#39;s cousin died from AIDs <br/>\n&gt; complications in the 80&#39;s. I never met him, but I&#39;ve asked Pat questions <br/>\n&gt; about his childhood memories of Terry. When did he realize his cousin was <br/>\n&gt; gay? What led him to realize it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jackie was not as interested in the Colonial House program, though she did <br/>\n&gt; watch about half of it. She was interested in their clothing. While we <br/>\n&gt; watched, she spent some time playing with Barbies and Digi-draw, and drew <br/>\n&gt; a number of portraits. In one Colonial House episode, one of the colonists <br/>\n&gt; drew a charcoal portrait of the lay preacher/governor. Other colonists <br/>\n&gt; were envious of the *leisure time* afforded to the artist (who was <br/>\n&gt; commanded to make the portrait) while the rest of them were processing <br/>\n&gt; lumber or preparing meals. Jackie asked me if I would borrow Colonial <br/>\n&gt; House from the library another time, and watch with her.  I said yes, then <br/>\n&gt; she went off to play something else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mary Ellen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
