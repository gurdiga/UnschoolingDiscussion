Then they open the pods and shake<br/>\nthe seeds out.  They leave them in the trays to dry for about a month and<br/>\nthen put them in seal-a-meal bags and seal them (zip locks would work or<br/>\neven waxed paper folded up and then sealed).  then stick them in a paper bag<br/>\nor under the cupboard away from light or even in the back of your fridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nOops, youngest is reading over my shoulder.  If they are for plants you want<br/>\nto bloom early, they stick them in the freezer for about a month and then<br/>\nplant them.

Even when I don&#39;t like what someone else says I try to learn something from it.  While I started out seeing your point of view Bridget I think you may be on the defense so much after feeling like you were being attacked that now all comments are coming across that way.  That happens to me.......I get my feelings hurt and then I can&#39;t see past that to see some constructive comments being made........I just see it as another attack.  I hope you can stop and look at each post for what its worth.  Some won&#39;t be worth anything, but others are worth their weight in gold if they make us really think about our decisions.<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Janet <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 7:53 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Labels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Bridget E Coffman <br/>\n  &lt;rumpleteasermom@j...&gt; wrote: <br/>\n  &gt; So . . . you are likening any form of structure in education <br/>\n  (anything<br/>\n  &gt; that even hints of parental control) to Satan and you wonder why I <br/>\n  feel<br/>\n  &gt; that you are doing more harm than good to your own cause?<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I like most about this list is the wide variety of people here.  <br/>\n  Christians and non-Christians, relaxed (or not so relaxed) <br/>\n  homeschoolers to the absolutely radical unschoolers.

I <br/>\njust like what he had to say.&quot;  You could see this would be a problem <br/>\nwith most christians.  To me it&#39;s the same as saying, &quot;we&#39;re <br/>\nunschoolers, but I have them do some writing and math to cover the <br/>\nbasics&quot;.   You&#39;re not accepting and trusting in the ideal.  That&#39;s <br/>\nfine.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not unschooling though.  You don&#39;t have to define yourself as an <br/>\nunschooler, or anything else.  I didn&#39;t for a long time and was fine <br/>\nwith that.  I kept striving for the ideal of unschooling, which <br/>\nbecame apparent to me by reading discussions like this.  I had a <br/>\nhuge &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment, and took the leap of faith.  The difference <br/>\nfrom then to now is so immense, that I now understand why unschoolers <br/>\nwant to make it clear, just what unschooling is.  Everytime you &quot;slip <br/>\nback&quot; and require learning from you children, you destroy the trust <br/>\nthat was building up in them.  The trust that you believe in them.  <br/>\nThe trust that they are smart enough to figure it out on their own.  <br/>\nThe trust that you belive that their interests and ideas are whats <br/>\nright for them.  When I relized that simple truth, I decided never <br/>\nto &quot;slip&quot; again, no matter how fearful I became.  I haven&#39;t.  I now <br/>\nsee the tremendous difference it has made in all our lives.  What the <br/>\ntrust really does for my children.  It&#39;s a lot of work, this letting <br/>\ngo of old mentalities.  I&#39;m still working.  <br/>\nI&#39;m writing this to try to help explain the difference in attitude, <br/>\nand why so many say, &quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot;.  I hope I made a <br/>\nlittle sense.<br/>\nJoanna (who doesn&#39;t really post here, but loves to read here)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Janet","from":"&quot;Janet&quot; &lt;jefhdvm@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"s-wn-SGRFdzpE_Hy6Dm6VNnNJGcB21e0DC0L-KUYnDL_yO4udH8rRBUvEZK9RgXXM-uElJ1L0LVEFpE4JMSnLV0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Labels","postDate":"1000133606","msgId":24995,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDluaWs1NisyN3BpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTEwLjEwMzIyMy4tNzk1MzMzLjE1LnJ1bXBsZXRlYXNlcm1vbUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24993,"nextInTopic":24997,"prevInTime":24994,"nextInTime":24996,"topicId":24983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
