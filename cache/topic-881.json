It makes me sound<br/>\ngrouchy, I know, but there is just too much to wade through when people are<br/>\ngenerally chatting back and forth and sharing it with everyone. All of our<br/>\nemail addresses appear on each email, so we could probably cut the number<br/>\nof emails by 25% (at least) if people would do a little more private<br/>\nemailing. If it&#39;s not related to UNschooling or if it&#39;s more of a personal<br/>\nnature or not that important that EVERYONE see it, please reply to the<br/>\nperson&#39;s email address privately. Then maybe I can change back from the<br/>\ndigest version to the regular version!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I will mind my own business.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n- - - - - - - -<br/>\nRobin Stark</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":873,"nextTopicId":886}}
