Fisher had a <br/>\ngame out (I think it&#39;s called a skoelje board, an old Frisian game that this <br/>\ngrandpa had made for him one Christmas) and was enjoying playing and keeping <br/>\ntracking of his points.  Then Grandpa stepped in and started directing the <br/>\nfocus toward the addition and counting -- not very subtly, either.  (Grandpa is a <br/>\nretired math teacher.)  While Fisher was excited because he liked how well he <br/>\nwas doing, after several minutes of having the numbers side of it drilled into <br/>\nhim, he was ready to be done.  As we were picking up the pucks, Grandpa <br/>\nstarted counting them, and Fisher told him firmly, &quot;No more counting!&quot;  I supported <br/>\nFisher by just making sure he was heard (&quot;No more counting -- okay.&quot;) but <br/>\notherwise let him speak for himself.  I don&#39;t know if I should speak to Grandpa <br/>\nabout it more, but I was proud of Fisher.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe seems to really get that we&#39;re unschooling and that means nobody gets to <br/>\ntell him what to do.
