She also wrote _The Homeschooling <br/>\nHandbook_ which has a section detailing different styles of <br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as what unschooling is - this is something I wrote awhile back <br/>\nto answer just that question.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about contining to do the things with your children<br/>\nthat you have done since birth.  Read to them, play with them, sing<br/>\nwith them, go on walks, visit the zoo and hands on museums where they<br/>\ncan experience things they can&#39;t at home.  Let them help you cook,<br/>\nshop, clean, etc.  Continue to live your lives the way you always have<br/>\nwithout the interruption of school.  Unschooling isn&#39;t about trying to<br/>\nteach your children something - it&#39;s about helping them to learn.  You<br/>\nread to them, and then one day they begin to read on their own.  They<br/>\nbegin to be able to seek out information on their own.  They ask a lot<br/>\nof questions about space so you help them search the net, look at the<br/>\nNASA sights, get out the telescope.  They ask about dinosaurs so you<br/>\ngo to the library and help them find the section with the dinosaur<br/>\nbooks.  You help them write letters to Grandma and when she writes<br/>\nback you help them to read them. As they get older, we expect it to<br/>\nchange, but it really doesn&#39;t.  They ask more complicated questions,<br/>\nbut you still help them find the answers.  You might need more help<br/>\nfinding answers, even a mentor, or a teacher here and there.  You talk<br/>\nabout the future and what paths their lives might take.  Sometimes<br/>\nthat means that they&#39;ll tackle some formal training or education.  You<br/>\nhelp them investigate this.  What&#39;s the ACT or SAT?  How do you<br/>\nprepare?  What do I have to do to get into this college or technical<br/>\nschool. How do I start my own business?   How do I become a nurse? <br/>\nHow do I know if I want to become a nurse ( excellent opportunity for<br/>\na volunteer project).  You encourage and facilitate.  You provide<br/>\ntools, books, tapes, software, but most of all support.  You<br/>\ncontinually remind yourself that this will work and seek out other<br/>\nunschoolers for support.  You trust, trust, and trust some more that<br/>\nyour child was born with all the curiousity they need to lead them<br/>\nthrough their education.  Most of all you enjoy the path you&#39;ve<br/>\nchosen. Celebrate everyday that you don&#39;t have to follow the crowd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Marbleface@xxx.xxx","from":"Marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"T59M5ecOD90PlypB52-pKtzxaEzL7ch9jzMK6sJTzosMN4Zv7FML0TULSlHQNxsIMAJHyaMuq-Oe","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Information Please","postDate":"938800571","msgId":3500,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzYuMzUwMC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3484,"nextInTopic":3508,"prevInTime":3499,"nextInTime":3501,"topicId":3484,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/1/99 4:21:16 AM !!!First Boot!!!, macer@wvadventures.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-956141559\">In a message dated 10/1/99 4:21:16 AM !!!First Boot!!!, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:macer@...\">macer@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; g is any one that can let me know I would really appreciate it.

Some will tell you there <br/>\nare rules; others will say do what works for you and yours.  We fall in that <br/>\nsecond category.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Fla and have to show a daily log/journal of activites and a <br/>\nportfolio that shows &quot;appropriate progress.&quot;  So I keep the juornal and stick <br/>\nwhatever product is produced in the portfolio and end up with a chrono pile <br/>\nof stuff we did.  It&#39;s not tooooo neat because some of it is photos and some <br/>\nis art work and some is math work and some is from the Internet.  We do what <br/>\nworks and what is fun and what comes up and (this is the not-so-unschooling <br/>\npart) we do what mom thinks we should be doing some time this year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"macer@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx","from":"macer@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xd5wPEgjy_RavopEmC-M92cCK6GNlSCZrJqV88Ws0d7vVAdivKcv4v5yu8EgIjgD8cpXV_1kC7orooCjBw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Information Please","postDate":"938751544","msgId":3484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzQuMzQ4NC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3500,"prevInTime":3483,"nextInTime":3485,"topicId":3484,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I homeschool my two children, but really interested in what unschooling is.
