He just doesn&#39;t want to have to go back to regular school.  There was a suggestion that I go with him or be around for support reasons but, unfortunately, even if I were there, ds would not be permitted to spend any of their visit around me - this is one of the few power issues I have chosen not to argue as his visits only occur a couple times a year and are usually in another part of the country.  I call him every other day or so to check on him - it used to be every day but this past summer he told me that he was big enough that every other day was fine...  (oh, my baby&#39;s growing up... :~)<br/>\n <br/>\nDad is coming on the plane to get him, then they are flying back for a week, then they bring him back.  Grandma has asked several times if I will allow ds to fly alone but I have refused each time due to ds&#39; age (7) - they are not happy because it increases their costs (3 round trip tickets instead of 1) but I quietly explained that either he would be picked up and brought back or he wouldn&#39;t go.<br/>\n <br/>\nDad and Grandma won&#39;t put him in school during the week he is there - Grandma is a teacher/principal and will &quot;assess&quot; ds, then use her results to nag Dad into doing what Grandma wants done.  (My opinion based on past experience - It is basically more time/trouble for Dad to bother with during the 11 months he doesn&#39;t see him, but Grandma is very much the ruler in that family.  If I can keep Grandma placated, nothing will come of this.<br/>\n <br/>\n         &lt;snip&gt;  ...Is there a pattern here of an overbearing, overly controlling matriarch<br/>\n         seeking to recreate the negative patterns of her own mothering with her grandchildren????<br/>\n          I mean if her son can&#39;t even stand up to her in advocating for his son.......   <br/>\n <br/>\nABSOLUTELY!  This control-attitude has been an issue since the day he told her we were getting married so I don&#39;t see much hope of him standing up to her.  He won&#39;t do anything that is more trouble for him, though, if he can help it.<br/>\n <br/>\nDs lives with me, but Dad shares legal custody, meaning that he gets a say in major decisions.  Changing this would turn into a *HUGE* fight, but Dad doesn&#39;t usually show much interest in being involved (not a problem as far as I see it!) so I think just getting him to not fuss is the easiest and fastest course.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor *their* peace of mind, I am not completely refusing to consider their concerns - I *am* open to schooling (sort of - it&#39;s based on ds and his wishes) and I told Dad (and Grandma) that in the past.  Both agreed that ds was not to go back to his previous school, both strongly agreed that the local Montessori school would be great, however...  When they found out they would be expected to pay his tuition (more than my rent each month) I didn&#39;t hear too much for a while...  LOL!

He never had any problems and loved school until first grade when a number of issues left me feeling that his remaining there was not a possibility.  I was always *extremely* involved with his education and was welcomed by the teachers and staff until first grade (new school and a long, not-nice story) and strongly felt that there was no reason I couldn&#39;t be what he needed, especially since he was so young.  This is our first year without any &quot;real school&quot; but both he and I are pleased with our progress thus far.  We are pretty easy-going about things, *lots* of flexibility, which seems to really do the trick.  He is doing very well at home and the behavior and emotional issues are leveling out. <br/>\n <br/>\nDad and I are divorced, Dad is remarried and lives out of state.  He is pretty uninvolved and blames it on being busy with work.  He *is* busy and physical visits are difficult for him to schedule (I know from previous experience) but phone calls are few and far between.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat having been said, Dad is not the problem (yet.)  Grandma is.  Dad&#39;s mother is a teacher of 20+ years and a principal in California (which, as I understand it, has a lot of regulations for this, unlike Indiana where ds and I are.)  She tests ds every time she is able to visit with him and has already stated she wants ds back in school due to socialization reasons (*NOT* academic reasons.)<br/>\n <br/>\nShe says her concerns are due to his visit out there last summer when, she says, he didn&#39;t know how to approach children (total strangers) to make friends and play.  I honestly don&#39;t know what the situation was since I wasn&#39;t there, but he has no problems with that here, as demonstrated by the sheer number of kids he plays with when we go to the playgrounds or parks.  (He has several structured classes/practices, etc.,  including choir, BMX, Cub Scouts, 4H and play dates, all of which are activities of *his* choice, as well as &quot;helping&quot; with the younger kids at the day care while I attend my own classes.  In my opinion, his social skills are fairly well-rounded and not an issue.)<br/>\n <br/>\nNow to the problem...<br/>\n <br/>\nDs is going to visit his dad over Thanksgiving.  Grandma will, of course, be there.  There have been recent phone conversations with both Grandma and Dad in which I have gotten the impression that there may be some &quot;trouble&quot; coming.  Grandma is pretty serious, Dad seems to be trying to stay out of it but still keep Grandma happy (that family is *EXTREMELY* matriarchial.)<br/>\n <br/>\nDs and I have discussed the possible options and he strongly wants to remain at home.  We have also discussed the probability of testing by Grandma (we just deal with this and go on since we can&#39;t do anything about it.)<br/>\n <br/>\nDoes *anyone* have any suggestions on how we can &quot;bullet-proof&quot; ds for his trip in a few weeks?  He wants very much to make Grandma and Dad happy but *really* doesn&#39;t want to go back to regular school.<br/>\n__________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLook What The New Netscape.com Can Do!<br/>\nNow you can preview dozens of stories and have the ones you select delivered to you without ever leaving the Top Home Page.
