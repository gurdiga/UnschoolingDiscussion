The strange thing is that I never <br/>\nhad pain until a few months before I conceived my first son!  I started <br/>\nhaving moderate pain at that point, but it went away as soon as I became <br/>\npregnant.  I think the relaxing of my joints and the hormones makes the pain <br/>\ngo away, because the same thing happened during my second pregnancy.  <br/>\nAnyway, five months after the birth of my first son (the traumatic birth) I <br/>\nwas in so much pain that I couldn&#39;t lay on that side and it hurt when I did <br/>\nvery much walking, moving around etc.  I was in tears often.  I saw several <br/>\nphysical therapists and it didn&#39;t help one bit.  Yes, it still pops out of <br/>\nplace from time to time, but visiting my chiro helps immensely.  She has the <br/>\nhip moved enough that it seldom pops out of place and I am no longer in <br/>\npain.  It did take over a year to get to that point though!  It might go <br/>\nquicker for a young child, I don&#39;t know.  It just takes awhile to get the <br/>\nmuscles used to the idea of having the bone in a new spot (the correct <br/>\nspot!).  My chiropractor told me from the start that she couldn&#39;t promise me <br/>\nthat I wouldn&#39;t need a hip replacement, but she would do everything possible <br/>\nto help!  And she has!  So, look for a chiropractor that you feel will be <br/>\nupfront with you and explain everything that she/he is doing.  She has kept <br/>\nour whole family very health!  Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had say I loved your story and my son&#39;s name is Colton too!  I had <br/>\nnever heard the name before he was born!  He will be one on Easter!  I <br/>\ntreasure each moment that I get to hold my babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8082,"nextTopicId":8094}}
