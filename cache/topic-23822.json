Then came mister superpersistant, the magical constructo boy who <br/>\ncan and did turn literally anything into a gun. So the rule was, don&#39;t point <br/>\nyour knex or toast or origami gun at me or anyone else who hasn&#39;t agreed to <br/>\nplay. Then came the day two years ago, on a shopping trip to spend his <br/>\nbirthday money from grandma, that he stood sighing in front of the cap gun <br/>\ndisplay saying &quot;I don&#39;t suppose there&#39;s any chance you&#39;re going to let me <br/>\nspend my money on one of these, is there?&quot; He came home with a bright red cap <br/>\npistol. No pointing or firing at anyone without their current permission, and <br/>\nclean up after yourself. Not so surprisingly, his gun play decreased <br/>\ndramatically after the first month and has never returned to it&#39;s former <br/>\nobsession.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;d had a kid who desired it that much earlier, I wouldn&#39;t have held out <br/>\nso long I&#39;m sure.
