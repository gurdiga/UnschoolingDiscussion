If I&#39;m counting right I saw two  &quot;non-manipulative<br/>\nmethod of persuasion&quot; and no &quot;manipulation&quot; votes, and I  was a bit<br/>\nsurprised.  Was it primarily the happy ending, or do people  just not<br/>\nfind the series of events  manipulative?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\nI thought it was a giant power struggle that happened to have a happy  <br/>\nending.  The mother threw down the guantlet over and over--she was just  lucky he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t pick it up as many times as she threw it down.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to force children to do what you want them to  do.  <br/>\nPicking him up and carrying him in the house could have gone really  badly.  <br/>\nWhat if he had chosen to fight or resist?  What good would  that have done?  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, he sat there in the car and then finally gave up and came in.   So he <br/>\nhad a good time.  But while he was out in the car, was he thinking  that no one <br/>\ncared how he felt?  It&#39;s almost as if, given the mom&#39;s actions,  he had no <br/>\nchoice but to engage in the struggle.  Ultimately, he lost.   He had to forfeit. <br/>\n Mom&#39;s stronger and bigger and can&#39;t wait it out  longer.  I&#39;m 5 and can&#39;t <br/>\nsit out in the car alone.  It&#39;s scary, and I  can see my mom in the window and <br/>\nshe won&#39;t come out to me.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s not something I want my child to feel.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103811,"nextTopicId":103824}}
