(The way we saw it back then, if the kids did<br/>\nnothing the entire year, we&#39;d only be behind one year<br/>\nand that didn&#39;t seem so horrible.

We let the kids do as<br/>\nthey pleased day in and day out (except the expected<br/>\nhelp around the house). Academically <br/>\nspeaking, it was open to whatever they dreamed up. My<br/>\ndd watched tv for six solid months. I thought I&#39;d<br/>\ncroak.

It wasn&#39;t until six months later<br/>\nthat our kids *finally* decided that there was more to<br/>\nlife than television. Each one in each family took a<br/>\ndifferent path. My dd asked for her old Miquan Math<br/>\nbooks to do on her own. Her dd started writing<br/>\nstories.  Her son learned to read by asking for comic<br/>\nbooks. More and more, the tv was left off. And things<br/>\ntook off from there.
