They are generally filled with tremendous <br/>\nPOSITIVE energy. Email is difficult - people come across different AND people <br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to let things just slide by, always want to comment on HOW other <br/>\npeople come across. In real life people just stop listening to someone if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t like the way they express themselves - but on email lists they <br/>\nfeel compelled to comment on it and that leads to long contentious negative <br/>\nthreads which are about the people on the list instead of about the subject <br/>\nmatter. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut - the unschooling conferences are so WONDERFUL.... the warm energy <br/>\nbetween the kids and their parents supports it and the joy of having several <br/>\nhundred or a thousand or more unschoolish people all in one place at the same <br/>\ntime is so relaxing and energizing at the same time. Lots and lots and lots <br/>\nof smiling and laughing and good humor!!! The speakers can challenge our <br/>\nthinking and offer information and ideas - it is different than an email list <br/>\nwhere they are sort of restricted to writing in fairly short email-length <br/>\nspurts. It is really a joy!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n---pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109120623,"authorName":"Camille Bauer","from":"&quot;Camille Bauer&quot; &lt;goddessofwisdom2@...&gt;","profile":"granolamomi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kate","postDate":"1019491555","msgId":35604,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBVjE4anJmSGswa3IzcWozMUQwMDAwYjBhMUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35589,"nextInTopic":35614,"prevInTime":35603,"nextInTime":35605,"topicId":35567,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would like to meet other USers IRL but if this is what they  will be like then maybe I should stick with standard homeschooling.

I discovered this group about 2 <br/>\nweeks ago and have been going back and forth about leaving it for <br/>\nabout a week and a half. It&#39;s not so much the bickering that makes me <br/>\nwant to leave. One problem is that I don&#39;t have the time to sift <br/>\nthrough the bickering posts to get to the &quot;meat&quot; of the information <br/>\non unschooling. The other reason is that I am trying very hard not to <br/>\nbe turned off to unschooling overall. This is my first exposure to <br/>\nunschoolers and so far I haven&#39;t liked what I&#39;ve seen. I am intrigued-<br/>\nno, enthralled-at the whole USing concept and am coming to understand <br/>\nthat it appears to be the right direction to go with my children. <br/>\nHowever I am left wondering if the preponderence of USers are like <br/>\nthose on this list. I would like to meet other USers IRL but if this <br/>\nis what they  will be like then maybe I should stick with &quot;standard&quot; <br/>\nhomeschooling. I like a good debate as much as anyone else but not at <br/>\nthe expense of exposure to all the negative energy. I am not a <br/>\nPollyanna who thinks the world is all rosy. To the contrary. I am <br/>\nvery much a realist and know that difference of opinion can lead to <br/>\nbickering. I just really don&#39;t need to be constantly exposed to it <br/>\nand would never stick around in a real life USing support group if <br/>\nthis was all I ever heard when we got together. So, in a roundabout <br/>\nway, what I am trying to tell you is that your post really spoke to <br/>\nme. It helped me to remember why I am in this group in the first <br/>\nplace. It helped to remember that I CAN pull out the good information <br/>\nand disregard the rest. I&#39;ll try to stick it out a little longer and <br/>\nI credit you with helping me make that decision. Thanks a bunch!<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35611,"nextTopicId":35606}}
