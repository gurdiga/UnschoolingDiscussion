Our family philosophy is that we learn what we need to <br/>\nlearn to do what we are doing right now, and what interests us right now.  <br/>\nWhen we renovated our bathroom we read and talked with people about how to do <br/>\nthis and we, even as adults, were unschoolers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, I do not have children in public or private school so have <br/>\nno experience with that scenario, but if I did I would still consider us an <br/>\nunschooling family that happened to have a &quot;schooling&quot; (for lack of a better <br/>\nword) child.  The family as a whole still holds to the same philosophy, that <br/>\nwe trust our children as we trust each other to make the right choices for <br/>\nthemselves at any given moment.  If our child felt that there was something <br/>\nin &quot;school&quot; that he needed (what I can&#39;t imagine, LOL) I would still consider <br/>\nus an unschooling family and that the child had made the choice to be a <br/>\n&quot;schooler&quot;.  This would be just a part of his lifelong journey.  I certainly <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t call him an unschooler as an individual at that particular moment <br/>\nthough.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: unschool math","postDate":"1046352606","msgId":59714,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBODM3QkQxLjE0ODgxJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFNUQzNjk3LjUwMzA4MDVAc3ltcGF0aWNvLmNhPg=="},"prevInTopic":59711,"nextInTopic":59718,"prevInTime":59713,"nextInTime":59715,"topicId":59642,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She had been out of school for almost 2 years. She said she wanted to go back for the &quot;socialization&quot;. On what would have been her fourth day back, she said, &quot;Mom, do I have to go back?&quot; I said &quot;No.&quot; She said &quot;Good, because school is so stupid.&quot; She told me later that there really is no socialization because the teachers won&#39;t let you talk to your friends in class, you can&#39;t talk to your friends in between classes because you&#39;re too busy rushing to your locker and you can&#39;t talk to your friends at lunch because you only get a few minutes to eat. She said it was pointless. And she said that &quot;home ec&quot; in particular was a &quot;joke&quot;. She said they had a quiz to name kitchen utensils (spatula, wooden spoon, whisk, etc.) She said &quot;Didn&#39;t we learn this stuff like when we were 3?&quot; lol. She never went back. She met a nice guy, got married and is having a baby any day now. She plans on homeschooling her kids. I don&#39;t know about unschooling. After I took her out of school (she was in 7th grade), she kept asking me when I was going to give her schoolwork to do. I tried to explain about decompressing, but she would say, &quot;Mom!

She has the option for all the rules that go along <br/>\n    with the school. She bends them, believe me, but knows the consequences are <br/>\n    her own to handle. She doesn&#39;t get any hassle from me. I really don&#39;t mind <br/>\n    if she pushes the limit of her uniforms. I don&#39;t mind if she doesn&#39;t do all <br/>\n    the homework. I don&#39;t mind if she skips a day or is late. It&#39;s all her <br/>\n    choice and she decides if the consequences are worth the bending of the <br/>\n    rules or not. She knows she isn&#39;t going to get in trouble here.<br/>\n<br/>\n    She&#39;s a great kid. Never in trouble. She&#39;s trustworthy and lets me know what <br/>\n    she&#39;s doing. She misses a day of school here and there. She makes it up in <br/>\n    her work because she likes seeing her do good by school standards.

That is why I think that even if a child <br/>\nopts to go to school for their own reasons, that they are still unschooling. <br/>\n  Its about choice.  Going to school is just one more choice in the buffet <br/>\nof an unschooling lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as the child has the choice to leave anytime they wish, they are <br/>\nstill unschooling in my humble opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know not everyone agrees with that, and thats ok.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually do agree with this. At least so far. &lt;bg&gt; Some others may come up <br/>\nwith something to have me change my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe woman who got me into unschooling, in my opinion at the time was very <br/>\nradical. This was years ago before I realized there were others out there! <br/>\nShe was totally trusting and respectful of her children. She unschooled them <br/>\nall their lives in a few different states. Her oldest, when she was about 16 <br/>\nwanted to enroll in Clon Lara. Now what I understand about it is they send <br/>\nyou work that has to be finished. Kind of like a mail order school program. <br/>\nMaybe less restrictive. Anyway, with the way her mom handled it all, I saw <br/>\nit as unschooling too. It was something her daughter wanted to do and <br/>\nactually found the school herself. It was handled the same way they handled <br/>\neverything else. It was all child decided. The daughter wanted the diploma <br/>\nshe got at the end and I think she just wanted to see if she could do it. I <br/>\nthink she was enrolled for 2 years until she finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also consider Tara now as being unschooled. It&#39;s not just the fact that <br/>\nshe has the option to quit school anytime she wants. She also has the option <br/>\nwhen to go or not and whether she wants to follow the rules or not. Now if <br/>\nshe decided she wanted all this and I made her be on time, go every day, do <br/>\nthe work, wear the uniform all because she&#39;s the one that &quot;wanted&quot; this, it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be the same. She has the option for all the rules that go along <br/>\nwith the school. She bends them, believe me, but knows the consequences are <br/>\nher own to handle. She doesn&#39;t get any hassle from me. I really don&#39;t mind <br/>\nif she pushes the limit of her uniforms. I don&#39;t mind if she doesn&#39;t do all <br/>\nthe homework. I don&#39;t mind if she skips a day or is late. It&#39;s all her <br/>\nchoice and she decides if the consequences are worth the bending of the <br/>\nrules or not. She knows she isn&#39;t going to get in trouble here.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a great kid. Never in trouble. She&#39;s trustworthy and lets me know what <br/>\nshe&#39;s doing. She misses a day of school here and there. She makes it up in <br/>\nher work because she likes seeing her do good by school standards. She&#39;s had <br/>\ndetention once for smacking some kid. I offered to go to school in her <br/>\nbehalf because I thought they were wrong and she asked me not to. She <br/>\nhandles this all with her own agenda. She does well as far as grades. She <br/>\nworks 5 days a week at Old Navy. She saves money, she spends money. She&#39;s <br/>\nrarely home later than 1:00 a.m. even though she has no curfew. Since I&#39;ve <br/>\nlooked at her differently, in an unschooling way, if you will, things in her <br/>\nlife have been better than ever. For her and for us because of her <br/>\nhappiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

I remember thinking : &quot; This is impossible.  You live you <br/>\nlearn.  Unless you&#39;re dead you can&#39;t help learning.  May be you even <br/>\nlearn after death too, I just don&#39;t have experience on that.&quot;  Later I <br/>\nrealized they meant that so-and-so didn&#39;t learned what they  wanted them <br/>\nto learn.  Well, that&#39;s different.  They wanted to control the 5 W&#39;s <br/>\nconcerning some informations they were passing to us.  And so-and-so <br/>\nwasn&#39;t re-acting, as they wanted, at that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me the difference between &quot;Schooling &quot; and &quot;Unschooling&quot; is a mind <br/>\nset, an attitude, a life style approach to learning.  Schooling happened <br/>\nin institution, where a person (the teacher) decide how you get access <br/>\nto information.  Schools depend on a system of punishments and rewards, <br/>\non conformity and lack of personal choices.    Unschooling is using the <br/>\nwhole world  (very inclusive, less segregated)  to learn what ever, when <br/>\never, how ever, why ever, with who ever you chose.  Choices are involve. <br/>\nChildren are born unschoolers.   I found this list useful to remind ME <br/>\nto return to the unschooling child I was, and trust my sons to blossom <br/>\nfreely .<br/>\n<br/>\nThere also seemed to be confusion between controlling and influencing ? <br/>\n  Take reading for instance, for years I would find books I thought <br/>\nmight interest them ( so did the 11 grand-parents and grand- relatives <br/>\nin my sons&#39; lives... ).  Sometimes they would get into one or another. <br/>\n Sometimes it didn&#39;t catch any of them, only me, or not even me.  Now, <br/>\n They read books and say: &quot; Momm , you should read this... (or)  You <br/>\nshould propose it to your reading club.&quot;    I could not make them read <br/>\nsomething, or learn something.  Learning is something you do personally. <br/>\n But when I sit back, I can see how our own personal learning have been <br/>\nintertwined over the years.  Yet, to take the weaver analogy, today all <br/>\nfive of us are a different weaving.  I don&#39;t want to control what they <br/>\nlearn, but we can&#39;t help influence each others learning.   We live <br/>\ntogether after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, enough coals in the fire for one day.<br/>\nFriendship<br/>\nLucie, in snowy Ottawa with twins sons 16 and son 10 and DH  almost 50<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: unschool math","postDate":"1046281689","msgId":59664,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyLjM2ZTg3MzUzLjJiOGU1N2Q5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59663,"nextInTopic":59675,"prevInTime":59663,"nextInTime":59665,"topicId":59642,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/26/03 9:56:51 AM, genant2@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-281028666\">In a message dated 2/26/03 9:56:51 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:genant2@...\">genant2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I guess if I really wanted <br/>\nto take that &quot;right&quot; away from them I could.

LOL.  Sometimes I say, in jest, to my husband <br/>\n&quot;I wish we had never made the choice to let them choose&quot; then we laugh and go <br/>\nback to it.  Giving your children the right to make choices for themselves is <br/>\nsomething you can never take back.  You give them a &quot;right&quot; and they know <br/>\nthey will always have this.  My sons would never take chocolate if that is <br/>\nnot what they want.  They would let me know what they really want then insist <br/>\non looking at the ice cream list at the shop and deciding for themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that wasn&#39;t&#39; the best way to put it because I guess if I really wanted <br/>\nto take that &quot;right&quot; away from them I could.  There would be repercussions <br/>\nand it would have a horrible effect on our family but I guess I technically <br/>\ncould take their choices away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes outsiders think that the way I parent is &quot;the easy way out&quot; <br/>\nbut I really think it is the harder road.  I force myself (and they force me) <br/>\nto treat my children like any other person... if I want my way it is about <br/>\ncompromise.  I can&#39;t just say &quot;do it because I say so.&quot;  That is not good <br/>\nenough.  I have to talk with them, discuss the whys and make compromises so <br/>\neveryone is happy.  It is about dialogue and takes a lot of effort.  I think <br/>\nthat society has programmed us that children do what parents want them to.  <br/>\nAnd if you start out from when they are infants maybe that works.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway my brain is foggy this morning.  Yes, morning, we just got out of bed. <br/>\n (ahh one of the joys of unschooling) Not sure how I got out on this tangent <br/>\nso far.  LOL.  But I was thinking about this last night when my youngest (5) <br/>\nsaid he was hungry and I said &quot;do you want popcorn or graham crackers&quot; he <br/>\nsaid &quot;neither, I am going to go look in the kitchen.&quot;  I looked at Jackson <br/>\nand said &quot; I should learn not to make those kinds of suggestions because he <br/>\nalways wants &#39;something else&#39;&quot;.  LOL Then I followed him upstairs and helped <br/>\nhim get out a bowl of cereal.
