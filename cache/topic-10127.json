Even pro-choice<br/>\nchristian ministers.  Not all christians agree that a<br/>\nzygote, for instance, has a soul...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd certainly many christians feel justified in<br/>\ncommitting violence, even doing so supposedly in the<br/>\nname of God.  The examples are numerous and obvious. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you can&#39;t make the *assumption* that the two<br/>\nautomatically go together. Which doesn&#39;t mean that you<br/>\ncan&#39;t make a logical argument that they *should*.  I<br/>\ncan, of course, understand perfectly if you are<br/>\nassuming a more &#39;in a perfect world, following the<br/>\nteachings of Christ, respect for all life should be<br/>\nstrictly adhered to, and I and the Pope agree that<br/>\nthis includes non-born life, and that is why I am a<br/>\nfruitarian&#39; point of view.  And of course an<br/>\nanti-spanking philosophy would be in keeping with that<br/>\nphilosophy... <br/>\n<br/>\nMost Jewish people I know are both pro-choice and<br/>\nextremely respectful of life... their definition of<br/>\n&#39;life&#39; as being &#39;born&#39; has to do with their<br/>\ninterpretation of sacred text, having to do with the<br/>\nmoment the soul enters the body.  I think<br/>\nScientologists have a belief on this score, and I&#39;m<br/>\nsure other religions (and cultures) have their various<br/>\ninterpretations of when a person is a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is my common annoying practice, I tend to get<br/>\nfrustrated with the black and white, winner take all<br/>\nattitude that so frequently dominates nearly all<br/>\ndiscussions on the subject of abortion.  I understand<br/>\nthat there is an inherent dichotomy between the belief<br/>\nthat *all* life (or perhaps all human life, includint<br/>\nthe unborn) is sacred and therefore deserving of<br/>\nprotected status, and the belief that human life does<br/>\nnot start until a certain point of gestation and that<br/>\nup until that point it is *not* protected.  What<br/>\nfrustrates me is the disrespectful attitudes that each<br/>\nside takes towards the other, as though there is no<br/>\nway in which the other side could possibly *sincerely*<br/>\nhold their opinion and so all discussion tends to<br/>\ndevolve to name calling and snorting and rolling of<br/>\neyes at best, and projectiles at worst.  I think that<br/>\nit should be at least possible to come to some sort of<br/>\ncompromise legislatively, such as is often hammered<br/>\nout in custody cases, in which nobody is happy but<br/>\nnobody is totally miserable either... but I<br/>\nunfortunately think it&#39;s unlikely that will happen. <br/>\n--- Annette Yunker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amyunker@...\">amyunker@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &quot;I&#39;m curious to find out how many of those who are<br/>\n&gt; so opposed to <br/>\n&gt;   spanking also call themselves &quot;pro-choice&quot;.  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; wondering where is <br/>\n&gt;   the line between respecting all life (born or<br/>\n&gt; unborn) and using or <br/>\n&gt;   not using corporal punishment on our children. <br/>\n&gt; Can you be both?  Pro-<br/>\n&gt;   choice and anti-spanking?  Or pro-life and<br/>\n&gt; spanking?  What do we use <br/>\n&gt;   to determine which violent acts are acceptable and<br/>\n&gt; which ones are not?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   For those who are Christians, the answers would<br/>\n&gt; seem pretty easy; all <br/>\n&gt;   life is to be respected and violent acts of any<br/>\n&gt; kind are <br/>\n&gt;   unacceptable.  For non-Christians, I&#39;m not quite<br/>\n&gt; sure what <br/>\n&gt;   the &quot;guidelines&quot; may be.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m hoping that many of you will continue to<br/>\n&gt; enlighten me with a <br/>\n&gt;   bigger picture of what you find acceptable and<br/>\n&gt; why.  I know that <br/>\n&gt;   curiosity killed the cat - I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; find <br/>\n&gt;   myself &quot;meowing&quot; after this one!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Chris<br/>\n&gt;   Chris, <br/>\n&gt;   I consider myself pro-life, but wrestle with the<br/>\n&gt; spanking issue.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   As I understand those who espouse what they<br/>\n&gt; believe to be &quot;Biblical&quot; spanking, it resembles<br/>\n&gt; NOTHING of the spanking I&#39;ve heard described on this<br/>\n&gt; list.  It is not used carte blanche for any<br/>\n&gt; perceived transgression or innocent childhood mishap<br/>\n&gt; such as spilling milk.  For those who practice<br/>\n&gt; Biblical spanking as I&#39;ve heard described, the<br/>\n&gt; result is not the same as for those who spank in<br/>\n&gt; anger (which seems to be the common experience of<br/>\n&gt; those on the list who were spanked).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Back to your comments.  Although I consider myself<br/>\n&gt; pro-life, I respect that the laws in the U.S. allow<br/>\n&gt; choice to others. It would be my sincere hope that<br/>\n&gt; others would choose life for the unborn, vice<br/>\n&gt; termination of life.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I hope we can have meaningful and respectful<br/>\n&gt; dialoge on this topic as I have the same curiosity<br/>\n&gt; as you.

It is not used carte blanche for any perceived transgression or innocent childhood mishap such as spilling milk.  For those who practice Biblical spanking as I&#39;ve heard described, the result is not the same as for those who spank in anger (which seems to be the common experience of those on the list who were spanked).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Back to your comments.  Although I consider myself pro-life, I respect that the laws in the U.S. allow choice to others. It would be my sincere hope that others would choose life for the unborn, vice termination of life.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope we can have meaningful and respectful dialoge on this topic as I have the same curiosity as you.

Usually when one wants something better it is because the<br/>\nold method doesn&#39;t work.  Spanking does work when it is applied with love.<br/>\nSpanking because the parent is angry and it is the last resort does not<br/>\nwork.
