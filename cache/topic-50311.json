There&#39;s also a part II and III, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently rented a movie from Blockbuster called &quot;Rose Red&quot; written by<br/>\nStephen King that was pretty good. It&#39;s specifically about a huge haunted<br/>\nhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Others&quot; with Nicole Kidman is a great movie to rent and watch with kids<br/>\nif they can tolerate a little scariness. It&#39;s not even violent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; with Bruce Willis? My kids loved that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever it&#39;s on, we like to watch &quot;World&#39;s Scariest Places&quot; on the Family<br/>\nChannel, although the scenarios are getting a little typical and fake to us<br/>\nnow. There were just a bunch on right before Halloween.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest son had wanted to watch the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; for the<br/>\nlongest time and we held back because it was rated R and because of all the<br/>\nprevalent cussing throughout the movie. It was recently on TV though (FX<br/>\nmaybe?) and it went through the editing process and had all the cussing<br/>\ntaken out. So we finally let our kids watch the movie that way - they were<br/>\nthrilled. At the end, they said it wasn&#39;t a scary movie at all and didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what the big deal about it was. But I think they&#39;ll think twice about<br/>\nit whenever we go camping. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also suggest movies like &quot;Creepshow&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;-the<br/>\nmovie, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and even &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; the movie and also<br/>\nthe old shows are great too.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, so many ghost and haunted house movies are rated R and you<br/>\nmay have to just let that slide a little bit, with your best judgement and<br/>\nmaybe previewing them. Also, take advantage of those scary movies that are<br/>\nedited for TV which may take the edge off a rated R movie.
