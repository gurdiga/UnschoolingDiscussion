We had a special time together and she got some treats. My<br/>\nhusband watched the movie with my son (Dillon). Dillon kept the remote in<br/>\nhis hand with his thumb on the fast forward button. (He did FF though some<br/>\nparts.)  We came home about 10 minutes before it was over. It was the ending<br/>\nscene with the big fight between Freddie and Jason. My daughter sat down on<br/>\nmy lap and watched the ending.  When it was over she turned to me and said,<br/>\n&quot;I must have missed the scary part.&quot; I said, &quot;You didn&#39;t think that was<br/>\nscary?&quot; She said, as if I was a total idiot, &quot;It&#39;s only a movie!&quot;  Smarter<br/>\nthan I gave her credit for apparently.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son wasn&#39;t terribly impressed with it. He said that he thought it was a<br/>\n&quot;trashy money maker&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally LOVE horror movies. I saw Amityville Horror when I was 6 and<br/>\nslept on my mom&#39;s floor for about 2 months. Now I can&#39;t seem to find one<br/>\nthat scares me at all and believe me I&#39;ve tried. I guess I never will since<br/>\nI think like my daughter. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son did sleep with me last night but he always does so that didn&#39;t mean<br/>\nanything. What surprised me was that Emma opted to sleep in her own room<br/>\nlast night. Go figure kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the wonderful and thoughtful advise.

I mean, think about it - this is a bad guy who either can&#39;t be killed or resurrects himself if the kids do manage to kill him.  He feeds off your fear and gets stronger every second.  He plays mind games with the kids in the movie and no one is *EVER* safe, even when the movie is over.  In at least one of the movies, Freddy actually kills the girl&#39;s parents and poses as the dad&#39;s ghost who has come to tell her he loves her before going to heaven.  She hugs him and tells him goodbye and that she loves him and then he kills her!!!  Can you imagine your **own father*** stabbing you in the guts with a hand full of knives???  This is ***not*** something I want my kids to worry about!!!  I would probably (definitely?) err on the side of caution when it comes to terror!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I was about 12 the first time I saw a Freddy movie - I was spending the night at my cousin&#39;s house and there were a bunch of us kids and my aunt.  She sat in the kitchen area with the light on and laughed at us!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nWe, in our infinite wisdom, turned off all the lights, pulled our blankets around and settled in.  Oh, did I mention it was storming horribly that night???  I don&#39;t know how many times we &quot;lucked out&quot; with huge lightning flashes or thunder rolls just at a horribly scary moment in the movie...<br/>\n <br/>\nSeveral times something happened in the movie and all us kids dove underneath whatever furniture we could reach, sometimes shoving someone else out the other side!!!  My aunt almost fell off the chair laughing so hard, but I can assure you I woke up in tears screaming for a long time thereafter.  To be fair, I don&#39;t think the other kids dreamed about it like I did, at least I didn&#39;t hear about it, but I thought it was awful to be so afraid!<br/>\n <br/>\nI did watch a few more Freddy movies as I got older but always with all the lights on, a bunch of people talking and distracting me and I paused the movies a LOT!  I never even got through all of them and I skipped the Jason movies almost altogether.  I saw the H20 movie finally, but I was in my late 20&#39;s at least!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd to make it worse, a few years ago when they remade the movie about the guy with the chainsaw, the boyfriend wanted to go with a bunch of our friends.  I was dubious, but I agreed.<br/>\n <br/>\nBIG MISTAKE!!!  I absolutely HATED the movie, got so scared that I nearly vomited right in the theater and literally had nightmares almost every single night for 2 months!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nI may be more reactive to these kinds of things than others since I have an extremely VIVID imagination, but my point is that once you are exposed to that, you can&#39;t sweep it up and put it back in its box.  It&#39;s there and you either deal with it or suffer like I do.  (Yes, I really do consider this suffering - nightmares and uncontrollable nausea can be very hard things to live with.)<br/>\n <br/>\nYou have to be the one to decide if your son and daughter are ready for these movies since you know them better than anyone, and truthfully, you are the one who will have to deal with any fallout.  I hope that whatever decision you come to, it works out for everyone!<br/>\n <br/>\n(I guess it&#39;s pretty obvious whether my kids (age 7, 3 and 1) would be allowed to see these anytime soon!  &lt;laugh!&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n--- Aubrey Lane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:a-lane@...\">a-lane@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son is 9 years old.
