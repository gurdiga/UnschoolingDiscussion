There <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;people who say &quot;I respect my children so much I will force them to go to<br/>\n&gt;school, play soccer and learn piano whether they want to or not.&quot; Or &quot;I<br/>\n&gt;respect my children so I spank them if they&#39;re bad.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Behaviors are easier to discuss than thought and intent are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38613,"nextTopicId":38622}}
