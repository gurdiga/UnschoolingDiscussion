When I took my computer out of <br/>\nmy bedroom, not only I could sleep better but I started to write more. <br/>\nThe energy in the room felt better. We put my old computer in the kids <br/>\nbedroom and now they rarely use it (we have to rearrange the old dining <br/>\nroom area once again to make space for it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, even if we moved to a house (which wont be happening anytime <br/>\nsoon) I think I would still keep the overall arrangement we have here: <br/>\nA room full of gadgetry (computers and TV included), a play room and <br/>\nthen the rest. I feel that each room or section of the living space <br/>\nshould be assigned to certain activities so that you can have high and <br/>\nlow energy spaces to go to. And make it a point to take a few moments <br/>\nduring the day to stop, breathe, do a little relaxation and if possible <br/>\nmeditation. Even if it happens once a week. My kids take breaks when <br/>\nthey see me take a break. When I stretch and do a little of yoga in <br/>\nfront of them (can&#39;t do a whole routine around my little one for fear <br/>\nof him inuring me!) they want to stretch and relax. The point is that, <br/>\nif I do it, they do as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the issue of emotional spaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father was a man of extremes who, unfortunately, gave in to the ones <br/>\nthat shortened his life. He knew how to exercise, eat well and relax <br/>\n(he had been an Olympic athlete) and he was a man of many skills that <br/>\ncould have kept himself busy after retiring. His depression exacerbated <br/>\npersonality traits that made it difficult for anybody to help him. The <br/>\nbottom line is that, as a man who had lived a full life he made his <br/>\nchoices. We as parents can only hope to create an environment in which <br/>\nour kids get the best of what they need to reach old age. For all my <br/>\nfather&#39;s shortcomings, I learned a lot about the mind and body <br/>\nconnection from him. He taught my brother and I a lot about how he as <br/>\nan athlete &#39;read&#39; his body and how he learned how to translate athletic <br/>\nendurance into other aspects of life. That&#39;s why seeing crippled by <br/>\naneurisms and dementia was more painful than the knowledge that his <br/>\nspirit is free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a lot of battles with him because I felt that with some of his <br/>\nactions he was walking away from a  home built with love and trust not <br/>\nonly for but with my mother, my brother and I. It took me years to <br/>\nunderstand that as he aged and made one choice after another, a lot of <br/>\nit was influenced by his dramatically deteriorating mental health. It <br/>\ntook some heavy dose of medical inquiry, personal growth and compassion <br/>\nfrom my part to understand all of that. I just wished I had a better <br/>\nunderstanding of all of this 7 years ago. Unfortunately, not even his <br/>\ndoctors understood what was going on. My a-ha! moment came after <br/>\nreading AGING WITH GRACE, which came out in 2000.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I have kids and think of motherhood as a creative process and <br/>\nnot just a survival instinct, I cannot help but believe that my kids <br/>\nwill too have their battles with me one day. What I hope to have that <br/>\nis different from my parents is a personal, emotional and spiritual <br/>\nplace that my children and I can recognize as a common ground for love. <br/>\nThat, regardless of our physical, emotional or psychological state, <br/>\nthere is a place where we can all meet and bask in the glow.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV, treats (we have no junk food at home, just treats), computers, <br/>\ngames, they are all really inconsequential. The question is, what are <br/>\nwe all doing now to blaze a path of love with our parenting? How are we <br/>\nliving the future now?<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TV and junk food","postDate":"1045183473","msgId":58640,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEtRjgzRndyQ0JGNXdoczYwMDAwYTRkNEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58740,"prevInTime":58639,"nextInTime":58641,"topicId":58640,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This means they can choose <br/>\nfrom what&#39;s available at the moment, and also that I&#39;ll try to keep their <br/>\nfavorites on hand. This doesn&#39;t mean that they spend 24/7 eating Ho-Ho&#39;s in <br/>\nfront of Sponge Bob though. They have complete access and therefore have the <br/>\nchoice to take it or leave it. And quite over they do leave it for other <br/>\nactivities and different food choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep the pantry and fridge stocked with a wide variety of breads, meats <br/>\n(sorry you veg-heads ;-)), fruits, veggies, treats, drinks etc. We own 2 <br/>\nTV&#39;s and have a DISH system that shows an amazingly wide array of <br/>\nprogramming from Shakespeare and opera to CatDog and Looney Toons. I believe <br/>\nthey all have merit if chosen freely by my kids. I even wrote something <br/>\nrecently about my dd Casey, then 8, and her comment about cartoon physics. <br/>\nThe kids kids are always thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal experience has been that limiting something makes it very <br/>\nspecial and desired. My kids have unlimited access and it&#39;s no big deal. <br/>\nThere&#39;s no sneaking or bingeing and they don&#39;t take advantage. They make <br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
