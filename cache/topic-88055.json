He spent years FIGHTING with his son every night at <br/>\nthe table where everyone had to eat together.  His son was a very <br/>\npicky eater, which I can understand as I have one.  He would force <br/>\nhim to eat or go to bed with nothing.  My SIL told me she wanted to <br/>\nhide in the bathroom, it was such a stressful time.

However, it is never worth the arguement.  <br/>\nHe is happy, he eats and if he wants to try things one day, he has a <br/>\nlong life to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople like him (and I love my BIL) love to gloat that their methods <br/>\nworked.

My little one would wake up first and *forage* &lt;g&gt; for chips <br/>\nand such in the cupboards.  Recently, I realized that none of us <br/>\nreally needed that junk around the house.  I would buy Doritos in <br/>\nthe store because my little one would ask and then we would both eat <br/>\nhalf the bag.  Not good on either end.  I stopped buying junk except <br/>\nfor a few favorite things like fruit snacks and brownies they eat <br/>\nfor dessert.  Just by having less junk around, Pierce is eating a <br/>\nlarger lunch and dinner.  I have also been making better choices and <br/>\nhe joins me while I am eating a peach or grapes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never restrict my kids when things are available.  At a New Years <br/>\nparty my 5yo ate one piece of chicken and my 2yo none and lord knows <br/>\nhow many cookies.  My SIL kept asking if I wanted something for them <br/>\nto eat.    They eat pretty well at home so when we go out or are at <br/>\na party, I let them enjoy whatever they want.  Also, if there is <br/>\nsomething very tempting at home, I let them have a good bit.  Not <br/>\nevery popsicle or bag of fruit snack but plenty to feel satisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also do not have a dinner time.  My kids eat when they are <br/>\nhungry, so do I.  My 5yo is still caught in some of our older <br/>\nrules.  He will eat dinner and than dessert.  Sometimes, he only <br/>\neats a little and asks for dessert.  I let him have it.  He may come <br/>\nback an hour later and ask me to heat up his mac and cheese.  That&#39;s <br/>\nfine.  He is very rule oriented so it should be interesting when he <br/>\nrealizes he can ask for a brownie before a meal.  My 2yo suffers <br/>\nfrom no such flaws&lt;g&gt; and pretty much grabs what he wants.  Many <br/>\ntimes leaving the brownie and choosing grapes.  I have never placed <br/>\nany restrcitions or food demands on him.

Food was always a forced issue in my house growing up. And at babysitter&#39;s. I once didn&#39;t eat except for school lunches when we spent a week at a sitter&#39;s. She made Ramen Noodles for dinner, and I can NOT eat them. She served it to me, cold, the next morning for breakfast (after I&#39;d sat at the table til time for bath/bed while everyone else was excused). I didn&#39;t eat. At dinner, it reappeared. The ONLY reason I think that she gave up at the end of the week was because my mother was coming in the morning. But I won..I didn&#39;t have to eat it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also swore I&#39;d NEVER do that to one of my children, nor would I not send them to bed hungry or otherwise use or withold food as punishment. It doesn&#39;t take any more effort for me to throw together a PBJ and slice an apple than to thaw out and cook another chicken breast. And sometimes..it&#39;s EASIER to let them have what they want than stand there at the stove frying up another drumstick! Two minutes to put together the sandwich versus however long it takes to fry the stick...!!! <br/>\n <br/>\nOnce, when Sarah was 3 1/2 we were visiting my mother. Knowing how she is about food, I stopped and bought a gallon of milk and box of Froot Loops for Sarah. Sure enough, later on, Sarah only picked at her dinner. She wasn&#39;t hungry or she didn&#39;t like it, but either way she didn&#39;t eat. My mom kept trying to make an issue of it, and I told Sarah she could be excused if she wanted to but that Grandma liked to have everyone still at the table even if they aren&#39;t eating. Sarah asked to stay. I cleared her plate, got her crayons and paper out, and let her sit. <br/>\n <br/>\nLater, while my mother was upstairs in her office, and after her bath Sarah decided she was hungry. I made her a bowl of the cereal with the stuff I&#39;d brought...and my mother had a FIT. Yelling at me that I have to send her to bed hungry if she doesn&#39;t eat rather than being a slave to my child, that I&#39;m too attached to her, and on and on. Sarah couldn&#39;t eat. She asked to be excused, we took care of her dishes and I took her on up to bed. At 1830!! She normally didn&#39;t go to bed until 2300, but this was my mother&#39;s house and her rules. I stayed with her as she cried. She couldn&#39;t understand why Grandma was so mean and why she wanted her to not eat when she was hungry, and eat when she wasn&#39;t hungry. All I could do was tell her I&#39;d watch out for her, and hold her. <br/>\nEvery night that visit, Sarah was asleep by 1900 because she was scared of her Grandmother. Over FOOD (although there were a couple other issues). <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not?!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Especially with young kids. Mine are 6, 5 and 3.5, but they are perfectly capable of deciding what they would like to do. Of course, I will often discuss the options with them first, help them to see the pros and cons of each side, but I respect their final decision. The grandparents (and even dh is guilty of this) will always talk about them to me--sometimes I think they&#39;re genuinely running it by me to make sure I&#39;m okay with it, which I appreciate. But I always say, &quot;Ask them.&quot; Half the time they look at me like I&#39;m crazy, or dh will be like, &quot;oh, yeah, okay.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDh&#39;s grandmother died last week, and my mother in law (fil&#39;s mother, not hers) decided she didn&#39;t want the kids there, so we stayed home. We had already asked them if they wanted to go before we knew mil would make an issue of it, and the girls did want to go. They had gone to my grandfather&#39;s funeral, and my oldest is rather fascinated by the concept of death and burial. But there was no way we were going to drive 5 hours one way so the kids could stay with a baby sitter! Dh went up by himself.

It was never really a battle, just never had the &quot;good stuff&quot; in the house.  As we are slowly making the change to an Unschooling lifestyle, I am letting go little by little.  My son had cereal, yogurt, and gummies for breakfast.  That would NEVER have happened before.  He did not eat till 10:30, and breakfast time is usually around 8:00.  Now he is at the table eating peanuts dipped in apple sauce, yuck!!!  This is lunch for him, again, never before.  It is what he wants, so I am letting him have it.  I feel, now, that he is making some healthy choices, and that is enough for me.  He is happy and that is what really matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I appoligize. <br/>\nI have asked that they clear there stuff up and put it away.. <br/>\nBecause I know that is my problem.I own that with them. There are <br/>\nsix kids and when we stagger our eating the chaos become a lot for <br/>\nme. <br/>\nI know how I want to feel about them eating when they want.. but it <br/>\nis myself getting in the way of always being able to let go and let <br/>\nthem..

That meant that sometimes, I&#39;d have them <br/>\ndangling from my breasts every 20-30 minutes.  Other times, 1 1/2 would <br/>\ngo buy and not even a look at my boobies. That&#39;s basically the rule of <br/>\nthumb here with food. We make 3 meals but we have no unbreakable <br/>\nschedules. If they want snacks, they&#39;ll have them. For every cookie I <br/>\nlay out, I also put on the table a fruit alternative like grapes or <br/>\nraisins or bananas. Always some cheese, maybe some baby carrots and cut <br/>\npeppers. Here, I do the &#39;spread&#39; either during breakfast, lunch or <br/>\ndinner. I just put out food, like on a buffet, and leave it there. My <br/>\nhusband works at home too, so it saves me asking all the time who&#39;s <br/>\nhungry. My little one is 3.5 and the big one is 6.5. They go through <br/>\nreally whacked growth spurts with growing pains and eating huge amounts <br/>\nof food --like 2 adult size plates filled with tofu and rice for the <br/>\nlittle one! They want their cookies and candy and what not and they get <br/>\nit. I joke that I make sure they have a balanced in-take of sugar and <br/>\nfat so they can wash out the tofu, sushi, fruit and vegetables they <br/>\nlike to eat. Does it drive me crazy that after making a nice meal all <br/>\nthey want is cereal? Yeah, to put it into perspective, we have food <br/>\nallergies and we can&#39;t eat anything with wheat. So we get these full of <br/>\nfiber Amaranth, Spelt, Oat, Millet cereals that they wash down with soy <br/>\nand/or rice milk because we&#39;re allergic to cow-milk as well. Their <br/>\ncereal intake is more a blow to my pride.

If not, what do you do?  I think you <br/>\nare all getting my point here, so I will just stop now...  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nErika<br/>\n <br/>\n*******************************************************************<br/>\nYes, if you let them control what they eat, they will eat what they need.   If you feel worried about it - offer them a kids-multi-vitamin every day.  Probably good advice anyway.  We all take multivitamins here (except the baby!) <br/>\n<br/>\nRemember how little a kid&#39;s stomach holds -- a sensible child may well figure out that if she wants to be able to eat enough ice-cream after dinner, she should skip dinner to leave some room.   Have ice-cream available whenever she wants it and she will stop skipping dinner to have room for the ice-cream during its limited availability. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there may be days when they eat nothing but goldfish and you have to be prepared for that.  In my experience, the balance happens over weeks, not days and certainly not meals. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never restricted Lydia&#39;s food, so I have no experience with how long the de-food-controlling stage might last.   While they are figuring out if you are serious, there may be weeks where they eat nothing but goldfish - and you need to be prepared for that.  But eventually if goldfish or candy or whatever are just another food in the house, they should stop having an artificial attraction for your children.  This whole paragraph about what happens if you control food and then stop  is just theory for me, though, so you should pay more attention to anyone who has actually controlled food and then stopped.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to stuff I have personal experience with: <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have an candy shelf filled with whatever Lydia (6) wants to request from the grocery store -- sometimes she eats candy for breakfast and sometimes she doesn&#39;t eat any at all for a week or more.  We keep the shelf locked so her 1 yo brother doesn&#39;t get into the chokeable stuff, but she can work the key and gets what she wants when she wants it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome &quot;what we do&quot; advice:  <br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid feeling like a short-order cook (this is for your own sanity):  Lydia has 2 things that she will always eat - plain pasta with olive oil and soy sauce, and peas and corn mixed with nutritional yeast (yes, she invented both &quot;recipes&quot; lol).  I make sure we always have those available -- if she doesn&#39;t like what we are having for dinner, she can always have one of those.  She doens&#39;t have to eat dinner with us -- but she almost always chooses to. Also, this isn&#39;t to say that I won&#39;t fix her something other than these if she requests it.  But she chooses these often enough and they are easy enough to fix  that I don&#39;t feel like I am running a restaurant when I want to eat my dinner. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids generally come to eat what you eat:  My husband and I both eat a lot of fruit -- Lydia has always wanted to share what we are eating.  She frequently requests fruit when she wants a snack.  Snack on baby carrots or cut-up broccoli yourself -- not making a big deal out of it -- just having a snack for yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTry vegetables that kids often like:  baked sweet potatoes, oven-baked french fries, corn on the cob, frozen peas (lydia used to like them still frozen!), snow peas, baby corn, <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than trying to make food &quot;fun&quot;, try to make it tasty:  I&#39;ve never done the playing with food thing (although I know lots of people who do) -- I do try to make it taste the way she wants it too.  Catsup, dips of various kinds (we love cashew butter mixed with honey as a dip for tart granny smith apples), my nieces like ranch dressing with their vegetable (although Lydia doesnt),  bean dips? not-very-spicy guacamole?   We drink a lot of smoothies and experiment with the different fruit/nut/combinations that we like.  In the summer we freeze the smoothies into popsicles with popsicle molds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep/Make  stuff available for snacking/grazing throughout the day: <br/>\nWe keep car snacks in a tupperware in the car -- cheerios, pretzels, dried fruit, nuts and raisin, and a cereal she really likes called &quot;puffins.&quot;   When Lydia is playing I often bring her a small plate of cut-up apples or pears or kiwi or mango, etc., a bowl of nuts and raisins, a bag of baby carrots, a plate of cheese cubes, to be there if she is hungry.  Now (at 6) I usually ask what/if she wants something, but at 3 or 4, I just put some stuff out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t make food artificially unpleasant:  I have NEVER forced Lydia to try anything.  I know there is tons of advice out there about how children have to try something 50 times to like it (or soemthing like that).  That hasn&#39;t been our experience.  From 0 - 2 1/2, she ate everything,  from 2 1/2 to 5 1/12 she ate almost no variety and didn&#39;t seek to try anything new (although she did have some non-mainstream favorites, like Nori (the seaweed wrapping around sushi) and chard cooked in tomato sauce and garlic).  Now at 6, she generally wants to smell and (if it smells good) try anything that her father or I am eating.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"Wife2Vegman","from":"Wife2Vegman &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Food-related question","postDate":"1073488208","msgId":88067,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTA3MTUxMDA4Ljg0MTc0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTctRjUxQW8yb2RZNHE2R0kwMDA1YmM5NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":88066,"nextInTopic":88068,"prevInTime":88066,"nextInTime":88068,"topicId":88055,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What would grow where you live? How much <br/>\nof the year could you get it?  There are few natural environments in which <br/>\npeople will have fruit and vegetables every day all year unless they&#39;re wealthy, <br/>\nand if they were wealthy enough to have them, their servants and farm workers <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t always have them.

That&#39;s pretty remarkable.   I <br/>\nbet it didn&#39;t look so good even when it was new, and there was no proof <br/>\nanyone ate it. &lt;g&gt;  Four months on a ship, at least?

It doesn&#39;t sound like it from your account.  If you <br/>\nlet her choose her own food, I can&#39;t imagine that she would want just one <br/>\nthing all day, unless it was in response to months or years of frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What if my son refuses to eat dinner, but then wants ice cream. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you gave him the ice cream first?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What if my son refuses to eat dinner&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would you give him food he didn&#39;t want?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Or what if <br/>\nhe refuses dinner but then gets hungry two hours later? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he isn&#39;t hungry and you try to feed him, and then when he&#39;s hungry you <br/>\nrefuse, it seems you care more about the clock than the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My instinct tells <br/>\nme to just forget worrying about any of it and just let them eat whatever <br/>\nthey want (just keep the options healthy) and after a few weeks they will <br/>\njust kind of regain their personal control over eating.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood instincts, in my opinion and experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;SO, I guess my <br/>\nquestion is, when letting your kids have full control over the food, do they <br/>\neat enough vegetables and the such?

We do try to eat healthy, although I am <br/>\nfine with sugar or junk foods at times.  The problem with me is that I worry <br/>\nabout their health, and want to make sure that they eat enough vegetables <br/>\nand fruit (no issues with any other foods).  I started out fine with making <br/>\nbroccoli into trees or playing silly games so they will eat fruit, and it <br/>\nwas all fun.

Now though <br/>\nthey are into icecream sometimes for dessert (a good non-sugary kind), so I <br/>\nwill say that they cannot have any until they eat all their vegetables, or <br/>\nfood.
