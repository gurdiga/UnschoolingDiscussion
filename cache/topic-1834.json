(I only make a little $ from it, but of course you could make more by <br/>\nputting more effort into the marketing and sales.)  Feel free to email me if <br/>\nyou want info on becoming a distributor or just checking out their excellent <br/>\nbooks, CD-ROMs, activity packs, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also do medical transcription from home, and anything else people will pay <br/>\nme to type at home in my jammies (data entry, architect and engineer specs, <br/>\ndesktop publishing, etc.).  There&#39;s an enormous demand for skilled medical <br/>\ntranscriptionists and I frequently have to turn work down because my workload <br/>\ncould easily become overwhelming.  I know there are college courses and <br/>\ncertified medical transcriptionist accreditations, but I dove right into the <br/>\nfield when I was 18 when I found a doc who was willing to train, and here I <br/>\nam almost 15 years later with a wonderful career that&#39;s PERFECTLY suited to <br/>\nmy current life with two Littles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace -- Debbie in CT, mom to Jesse since 11/94 and Leah since 5/98</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1832,"nextTopicId":1689}}
