It <br/>\ntakes different &quot;things&quot; and just explains how they work.  Really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then we ran across a REALLY good documentary on the Discovery Channel <br/>\nabout cavemen, narrated by Alec Baldwin.  It was so cool because he started at <br/>\nthe species furthest from us and proceeded up the line, showing each skull, the <br/>\ndifferences from ours and from the species before it and after it (in the <br/>\nscheme of evolution) then there&#39;d be a reinactment of what scientists believe each <br/>\ngroup looked like, acted, what they ate, relationships, etc.  Only bad thing <br/>\nabout the whole show was the commercials!
