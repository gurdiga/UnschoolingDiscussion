Is our motive to impress others?  If so,<br/>\nthen perhaps we shouldn&#39;t act.  Is our motive to make someone else look bad?<br/>\nIf so, then we shouldn&#39;t act.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if building up another is our immediate motive, then we<br/>\nshould act.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who follow the Categorial Imperative do good for the right reasons;<br/>\nnot because of a promised reward, or fear of punishment, but rather because<br/>\ndoing good is it&#39;s own reward.  Admittedly, sometimes to reach that state of<br/>\nconsciousness, we school ourselves with systems of reward and punishment.<br/>\nHowever, we mustn&#39;t forget that in human development, such systems are only<br/>\nscaffolding.  At some point, we must remove the scaffolding in order to<br/>\nreveal the true edifice: a mature human being whose actions stem from<br/>\nrational and pure motives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUncoventional Ideas at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unconventional.go.to\">http://unconventional.go.to</a><br/>\nThemestream Articles<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_by_tag.gsp?auth_id=34436\">http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_by_tag.gsp?auth_id=34436</a><br/>\nRead about the Andersen family travels:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen/travel.html\">http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen/travel.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13802,"nextTopicId":13806}}
