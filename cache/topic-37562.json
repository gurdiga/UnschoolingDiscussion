Hirsch says<br/>\nit&#39;s part of required &quot;cultural literacy&quot; is not so cool. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people hate those Hirsch books, or have said they did, and it seems <br/>\nto boil down to the title of &quot;needs&quot; to know.  Joyce pointed out that he did <br/>\nrecommend using better materials than his own in some (or all) cases.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he means by &quot;needs to know&quot; is bigger than that set of books.   As he <br/>\nwas the main proponent of &quot;Cultural Literacy&quot; as a basis for schools&#39; <br/>\ncurriculae, and he WAS starting to be listened to, he wrote that series as a <br/>\nway to create a path to the theoretical goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat his overall system involves is everyone in the culture having common <br/>\nterminology and a common historical knowledge base so that when something&#39;s <br/>\nbeing discussed among educated adults, few to none of them are standing there <br/>\nbaffled as to what the others are talking about.  And a big part of the <br/>\ncommonality he&#39;s promoting is linguistic and literary.  That&#39;s why the books <br/>\nhave the common phrases, idioms, homilies--&quot;don&#39;t let the cat out of the bag&quot; <br/>\nand things like that.  And that&#39;s why the folktales and mythology.  If <br/>\nsomeone says &quot;the patience of Job&quot; it might be useful for others to know who <br/>\nthe heck Job was and what the overall context of that statement is because <br/>\nit&#39;s not just &quot;patience,&quot; it&#39;s much larger.  &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot; is <br/>\n(I think) the only simple reference in our culture to the idea that people <br/>\nare so easily led as to say they see something they don&#39;t, if they fear for <br/>\ntheir own self-image in the presence of those they perceive to be wiser or <br/>\nbetter.  That&#39;s a lot of words to say &quot;the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.&quot;  So people <br/>\nwho know those stories can communicate better with one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, which is an odd little <br/>\ntown filled with intellectuals of geeky breeding, in HUGE part, and when <br/>\nphysicists marry physicists and live among physicists, some weird things do <br/>\nhappen.  (The&#39;re starting to intermarry nowadays &lt;bwg&gt;.)   He only knew what <br/>\nhe knew, and what he knew he had pretty much learned on his own.  What his <br/>\nparents had valued was satire from before 1950 (what THEIR parents had <br/>\nvalued, and nothing new), math and science.  Engineering.  He learned to fix <br/>\ncars a bit, from his dad, and to tie lots of knots, from boy scouting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were English majors.  I was out before he got to UNM, and knew him while <br/>\nhe was in college.  He was having a TERRIBLE horrible time in Shakespeare and <br/>\nMilton and some other literature  classes because he knew not ONE Bible story <br/>\nbut the nativity and knew vaguely about what Easter was about.  He knew no <br/>\nGarden of Eden, Noah, Tower of Babel--none of those things which others are <br/>\nexpected to know.  So he didn&#39;t want to go to church to learn them (they <br/>\ndon&#39;t teach those to adults so much as kids anyway), and so I was telling him <br/>\nthe stories and finding the passages to give him to read.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that they didn&#39;t go to church at all ever.  His mother was an <br/>\numpty-generation Unitarian from New Hampshire or somewhere.  He just didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any Bible basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s the sort of situation Hirsch&#39;s stuff is designed to address.  If <br/>\nyou want to read Shakespeare it helps to know English history and the Bible <br/>\n(at least the highlights) first.  It helps to know the cultural situations at <br/>\nthe time the things were written. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Derek was fascinated most by the story of Jacob and Esau, and Jacob <br/>\nfooling their father into blessing him instead of his hairy brother.  It&#39;s <br/>\nGenesis 27, and sets a weird light on the whole business of Jacob and the <br/>\ntribes of Israel.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t &quot;use&quot; the Hirsh books in order, but I do look in there once in a <br/>\nwhile and do a mental checklist, and I wouldn&#39;t feel bad if given a straight <br/>\nchoice between something the kids already know, and something that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t, directing their attention toward the new piece of information.  But I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t press it if they passed it by.  Any information worth having is out <br/>\nthere in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: a rich environment","postDate":"1022546081","msgId":37562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDRjJEMDk3Ljg3Q0UyRUU3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37615,"prevInTime":37561,"nextInTime":37563,"topicId":37562,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**At libraries they put the new books out on open shelves, so you can see the covers.
