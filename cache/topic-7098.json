My oldest daughter is 4<br/>\n&gt; 1/2 years old.  We (my hubby and I) know that we want to do homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt; I am just not sure what avenue to take.  Unschooling philosophies are<br/>\n&gt; appealing to me and make sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question is, what do you do?  I got a pretty good idea of what<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is not.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Currently my daughter loves the time that her sister takes a nap and we do<br/>\n&gt; &quot;homeschooling.&quot;  This is more a term than an actuality.  But a couple<br/>\n&gt; times a week, we do practice writing letters and spelling her name.  On<br/>\n&gt; occassion I have been teaching her the names of different coins and<br/>\n&gt; teaching her how to classify fruits and vegetables.  These are both done<br/>\n&gt; through game like activities.  I chose these 2 areas, because she seems to<br/>\n&gt; have been picking up on it on her own and I wanted to strengthen her<br/>\n&gt; knowledge.  Anyway, the time we do spend is usually focused time.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; easiest to do when her 2 year old sister is napping.  Oh, and we always do<br/>\n&gt; some craft or cooking activity too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Like I said, she absolutely loves this time, and begs for it everyday.  I<br/>\n&gt; get the feeling that unschooling would be much less casual than this<br/>\n&gt; focused time I have been spending.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In your opinion, what are some things I should be doing.  And should I<br/>\n&gt; continue what I am doing, since she enjoys it so much?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carli<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
