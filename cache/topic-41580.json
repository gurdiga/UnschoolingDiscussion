There is the health issue of carrying a lot<br/>\nmore weight than a particular body should be carrying.  This amount<br/>\nvaries from person to person, but in general most people have health<br/>\nissues if they are 20+ pounds over their healthy body weight range.  I<br/>\nview it as one of my responsibilites as a parent to model healthy eating<br/>\nand exercising habits.  We are neglecting our children if we &quot;allow&quot;<br/>\nthem to get 100 pounds overweight by eating Ho-Hos all day long.  I am<br/>\nnot implying that any of you are doing this, but I do see it often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother that said her son was &quot;overweight&quot; never said how much<br/>\noverweight he was.  Maybe it is just who he is, and maybe he has a real<br/>\nhealth problem.  If the later, it would be easier for him to start<br/>\naddressing a healthy lifestyle as a young man, rather than have a heart<br/>\nattack at age 30!  I don&#39;t know his particulars, of course, but we can&#39;t<br/>\nlive in ignorance of obesity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly believe that a lot of women can be 100% healthy at size 16.  I<br/>\nwas one of them for a while.  However, when I got into the size 20+s, I<br/>\nwas NOT healthy.  My body ached and wouldn&#39;t let me do anything fun.  It<br/>\nwas a wake up call for me and I looked at what I was showing my children<br/>\nby being unhealthy, overweight (for me), and not able to run around and<br/>\nplay with them.  I was not being a good role model.  I started eating<br/>\nhealthier (and less quantity) and exercising more and I&#39;ve lost 80ish<br/>\npounds.  I am proud of what that is showing my girls and they&#39;ve learned<br/>\na lot about nutrition along the way.  It is not good to obsess, it is<br/>\nnot good to be overweight, it is not good to be underweight.  This, my<br/>\ngirls learned while watching me take care of myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely be happy with who you are, but always strive to be the best<br/>\nyou can be (physically, emotionally, and intellectually, just to name a<br/>\nfew ways).
