I had to be on bed rest with one of my kids......<br/>\nMy 9 year old at the time (he&#39;s 18 now) had to learn to cook since hubby <br/>\ntraveled alot. I kept things simple for him.<br/>\nThen my oldest daughter started fixing simple meals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings have still remained that way....... They will kick me out of the <br/>\nkitchen. The 4 older ones do most of the cooking. I fix hubby his grits cause <br/>\nno one in the house can fix them like I do adn occassionally breakfast for <br/>\nthe 1, 3 and 6 yr olds if my 14 & 17 yr old are not up yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWait...let me clear something up first...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kiddies....<br/>\n18 (ds, who will be 19 march 5th) He does his own laundry and  hubby & mine <br/>\ntoo when it is full. He fixes most of his own meals since he is a night owl <br/>\nand doing his thing...<br/>\n17 yr old (dd).......who does the main laundry detail and well as her own and <br/>\ncooks dinner everynight with the 11(dd) & 14(dd) yr olds assistance. Of <br/>\ncourse the  11 & 14 yrs better have their lanudry downstairs own schedule are <br/>\nit will not be washed including the 3(dd) & 6 (dd)yr olds. The 1yr(dd) olds <br/>\nstuff is usually in my laundry, but it can make and apperance in all of <br/>\nthem....<br/>\nThey are responsible for keeping their rooms clean and well as their chores <br/>\nwhich are on a 2 week rotation which includes , dishes, mopping, vaccuming, <br/>\nbasement, sweeping, etc....<br/>\nThey get money for extra jobs......Like if my hubby is too busy to do the <br/>\nironing for me and him (he loves to iron...go figure) he will pay our 11 yr <br/>\nold per basket or load.<br/>\nMy son gets paid for being our handy man (minor plumbing or electric work, <br/>\netc).......he got paid for putting up the lights for kwanzaa, tilling my big <br/>\ngarden and planting the veggies and mowing it. In fact any planting and yard <br/>\nwork that has to be done, he is in charge of it and we pay him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me........currently nursing a 18 month old which I am weaning <br/>\nalittle...just down to  2-3 nursings aday because I am <br/>\nexpecting......computer work, inventory, shopping and errands when hubby is <br/>\nout of town,unschooling stuff and getting their worksheets or what have <br/>\nyou,running a homeschool support group, and doing ALL of the sewing in the <br/>\nhouse. Which means I hardly ever buy clothes. and never buy  diapers ( all <br/>\nbaby items are made, including nursing pads and nursing clothing). All our <br/>\nclothes and coats I make unless I can get some things on clearance and it is <br/>\nno higher than $3. <br/>\nMy 11 year old is learning how to sew...so soon she will probably be doing <br/>\nher own stuff.<br/>\nI&#39;ll put it this way....I make everything except socks and shoes. I make my <br/>\nown curtains and other home dec stuff.<br/>\nThere is no way that I can do all the things that I do and do all the other <br/>\nstuff too and I will not try.<br/>\nOccasionally I will treat myself to a  venti vanilla latte at starbucks (it&#39;s <br/>\ndecaf now since I&#39;m preggie).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust in case you all got confused with the kid count...<br/>\n<br/>\n18 (young man)<br/>\n17 , 14, 11, 6, 3 (will be 4 next month) and 18 month old are all girls....<br/>\nNewbie do in August and we will not know until birth since we are <br/>\ndoing/planning another unassisted birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111436570,"authorName":"lurningathome@aol.com","from":"lurningathome@...","profile":"tolearnwithfreedom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2830","postDate":"1042246248","msgId":54252,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwZS4xY2U1NjBkNi4yYjUwYzQ2OEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54133,"nextInTopic":54261,"prevInTime":54251,"nextInTime":54253,"topicId":54125,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/9/2003 1:25:48 PM Central Standard Time, ...
