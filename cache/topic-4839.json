I apologize in advance for this appeal but, as I hope you<br/>\nwill see, it is heartfelt and much needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father is now 89, mother 73 � they have worked uninterruptedly as<br/>\nGandhian land reform organizers, trying to bring land to the landless<br/>\npoor, for some 50 years.  And after about 30 years, their work began to<br/>\nbear fruit. Through an inventive combination of loans, nonviolent action<br/>\n(to get government land ceiling laws enforced), friendly persuasion, and<br/>\njust plain hard work, through their organization Land for the Tillers<br/>\nFreedom, they have helped 11,000 agricultural families come to own their<br/>\nown land � most of whom had been landless for more than 40 generations.<br/>\nThe land is held either in cooperatives, or by women (the men have been<br/>\nknown to sell it to pay for drink), provides for the basic needs of<br/>\ntheir families, with enough left over to support small cottage<br/>\nindustries.  I have visited regularly since 1977 and, quite frankly, it<br/>\nis a miracle!  They have been nominated for the International Right<br/>\nLivelihood Award, and Women�s World Summit Foundation in Switzerland<br/>\njust gave my mother their prize for �Women�s Creativity in Rural Life�,<br/>\ncalling her �a Gandhian Joan of Arc�.  Whenever I am there, I get<br/>\nintroduced to all my �relatives�, as she is considered mother by all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last 3 years, they have had to fight another battle (their lives<br/>\nalmost sound Biblical in proportion!) � against multinational<br/>\ncorporations who had set up prawn farms that were destroying the coastal<br/>\necology, salinating and polluting the soil, destroying the mangroves<br/>\nprotecting against the cyclone winds.  My father�s case ended up in the<br/>\nIndian Supreme Court � he and his one lawyer against 116 lawyers<br/>\nrepresenting the multinationals.  He won � the Supreme Court ordered all<br/>\nthe prawn farms in fragile coastal areas closed -- but quite literally<br/>\nlost his eyes in the process.  The government threatened to pass a law<br/>\noverturning the Supreme Court order, while he was having an eye<br/>\noperation.  He signed himself out of post-operative recovery 10 days<br/>\nearly, traveled 2,000 miles via train in 110 degree summer heat, and set<br/>\nup a fast at the Gandhi Memorial in New Delhi.  The government backed<br/>\ndown, but his eyes never recovered.  And this year, after a series of<br/>\nnonviolent actions and fasts involving thousands of people, he got the<br/>\norder enforced, at least in the district where their land reform<br/>\nactivities havetaken place.  I have come to learn that when my father<br/>\nacts as Don Quixote going up against the windmill, I wouldn�t bet on the<br/>\nwindmill!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the middle of all of this, my mother also collects stray children.<br/>\nLiterally.  She picks them off garbage heaps, roaming the streets,<br/>\nbegging in bus stations.  (A boy I personally  support was found hanging<br/>\nfrom a tree by one foot, placed there by an abusive father.) She now has<br/>\n120 of them, (46 at my �home�) who she feeds, clothes, houses, sends to<br/>\nschool, and finds what love she can for them.  We�ve managed to find<br/>\nfamilies in Italy to �adopt� them and pay for their expenses. Last year<br/>\nwhen I was in India, I raised money (my own and some friends) to deepen<br/>\nthe well next to the house, so the kids could plant 200 new coconut and<br/>\npapaya trees � they help plant and harvest rice, care for six<br/>\nmilk-giving cows and water buffaloes, and grow vegetables (all in<br/>\naddition to their school work), so they can help feed themselves.  My<br/>\nmother and father live simply (on around $70 a month) � since 1939, my<br/>\nfather has spun the cotton for every article of clothing he has worn<br/>\n(luckily, he doesn�t need much clothing). So their own needs are<br/>\nminimal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we have a need, and that�s why I am appealing for help.  The 11,000<br/>\nfamilies now have land, but their houses are made of mud and straw, and<br/>\nwhen the cyclones come (as they did north of them this year), the houses<br/>\nare virtually all destroyed.  They leak during the monsoon rains (which<br/>\nhappen twice year), and the kids end up sleeping on the wet ground. My<br/>\nmother�s dream is to house them all decently, or more correctly, have<br/>\nthem house themselves.  She has a well-developed plan whereby she can<br/>\nstart a cottage industry making cinder blocks, sell enough of the blocks<br/>\non the open market to cover raw material costs, and have the people<br/>\nbuild their own homes with the bricks they make themselves.  But she<br/>\n(we!) need just under $5,500 for a brickmaking machine (and the people�s<br/>\nability to access loans is already too stretched by payments on the<br/>\nland.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have received sponsorship from the Gandhian Foundation, a 501(c)(3)<br/>\ncharitable organization based in New Jersey to receive funds for the<br/>\nproject (which I desperately want to get started after this year�s rice<br/>\nharvest festival � the South Indian equivalent of Thanksgiving, around<br/>\nJanuary 20 � after the harvest, people are free to pursue cottage<br/>\nindustries, and build homes.  I plan to contribute significantly from<br/>\nwhat income I make from my book (And the Skylark Sings with Me), and my<br/>\nkids are counting their pennies, too.  THERE ARE NO ADMINISTRATIVE<br/>\nEXPENSES RELATED TO THIS PROJECT.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, tax deductible donations (large and small) will be deeply, deeply<br/>\nappreciated.  They should be made out to the Gandhian Foundation, and<br/>\nmailed to me:<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\nSkylark Sings<br/>\n1717 18th Court NE<br/>\nOlympia, WA 98506<br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope you will seriously consider this appeal. Thanks very much<br/>\nindeed, and have a joyful, prayerful, truly meaningful thanksgiving and<br/>\nremembrance of what it means to live in a land where there truly is<br/>\nenough for us all.<br/>\n<br/>\n(P.S.  If there are homeschoolers who want to know more about India,<br/>\netc. � we�d be happy to help � we might also be able to arrange for<br/>\nIndian penpals -- though I can�t promise this for sure � you have to<br/>\nremember, the kids we are supporting are just becoming literate in their<br/>\nown languages, and most struggle with their English.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-------<br/>\n<br/>\nAnthony Manousos calls &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in<br/>\nHomeschooling and Community-Based Education&quot; &quot;a joyous celebration of<br/>\nthe creative potential in every child.&quot; To read a sample chapter,<br/>\nreviewers&#39; comments, or the foreword, and for ordering info., visit my<br/>\nwebsite at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skylarksings.com\">http://www.skylarksings.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4816,"nextTopicId":4840}}
