Since <br/>\nJon works in a mall, there&#39;s no lack of opportunity for people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe showed me a picture of a group of teenagers, and the one holding Mr. T was <br/>\nwearing a skullcap with that red anarchy symbol on it.  But below the neck he <br/>\nwas wearing the same sweatshirt every other kid in the group was wearing!  It <br/>\nwas quite humorous and informative.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other pictures of Mr. T are funny, too.  Maybe we&#39;ll put them on a <br/>\nwebsite somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJon was just like the 14 yo girls that have been posted about.  He was in <br/>\npublic school for a year when he was about 15-16.  He organized a walk-out of <br/>\na school play that was about Christianity.  He got in trouble for challenging <br/>\nthe English teacher when she talked about Christianity.  (This was a rural <br/>\nhigh school in Arkansas, where Christianity dominates.)  He also got in <br/>\ntrouble for challenging the teacher about his right to use the restrooms at <br/>\nwill.  Some of the teachers came to agreements with him.  Others are probably <br/>\nSTILL glad he left!   I know his guidance counselor is!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI handled it by encouraging him to push the limits that he felt necessary, <br/>\nwhile also making clear that any consequences were his to own.  I also <br/>\ninsisted that he strive at all times not to do anything that was actually <br/>\nillegal (vandalism, violence, etc.).  We talked about what some of those <br/>\nthings might be, and the repercussions if he did them and got caught.  We <br/>\ntalked about the worth of the action versus the consequences.  He knew he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to stay there if he didn&#39;t want to, and that I would drive the <br/>\n150 miles to come and sign him out if I needed to.  (He was living with his <br/>\nfather at the time.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say that I was always proud of what he did.  He seemed to cause <br/>\nunnecessary struggles for the teachers sometimes.  But I figured he couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe any worse than the kids who were challenges who DIDN&#39;T have a parent <br/>\nsupporting and trusting them.  My father labelled Jon a &quot;contrarian&quot; at an <br/>\nearly age (before he could walk, even).  I don&#39;t know if it was correlation <br/>\nor causation.  &lt;g&gt;  But that label still defines him in a lot of ways.  He <br/>\nand his girlfriend both have bright pink hair currently, yet they have <br/>\nstarted to attend and perform dramas at an apparently (very) liberal <br/>\nChristian church.  Even I&#39;m surprised, given his reaction when he took <br/>\ncollege philosophy at age 14.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think listening to kids is what gets you through.  Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if <br/>\nin 20 years your teenager said, &quot;My mother always listened to me&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"bry2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kids and Trouble","postDate":"1041719263","msgId":53099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWEwMWMyYjQ0MCQ4MDI1MjVlMCRiNTU3NTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+","referencesHeader":"PDE3Ni4xNDE5MjAwOC4yYjQ4NGFiZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53091,"nextInTopic":53102,"prevInTime":53098,"nextInTime":53100,"topicId":52956,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Where is Woodard?

He has always had this anti authorrity streak - now he is older he exerts some of this angst by being a member of a political party. I don&#39;t feel that had/has a behaviour problem - now or when he was younger. It is just him, and he has learned to see where he can make a difference.

Even though I didn&#39;t inquire <br/>\nfurther what that meant, I assumed there was a problem being expressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that rebelling is necessarily a behavioral problems either <br/>\nas a definition (I am a rebel at heart myself and married one as well), <br/>\nand rebelliousness during adolescence is quite normal and healthy in <br/>\ngeneral, but there are many different ways of rebelling, and some can be <br/>\nvery self-destructive. They come in all shapes, shades and forms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was referring to those who do have a problem, not because they don&#39;t <br/>\naccept the mainstream *box* and hypocritical masquerade of politicians <br/>\nand such, but because they can make their lives (and those around them) <br/>\nmiserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other side of the spectrum, just as a quick example: a teenager <br/>\nwho is *too* proper and does not rebel at all (is subservient to his or <br/>\nher parents), also has a behavioral problem from a homeopathic <br/>\nviewpoint. Why? Because - to say it lightly- s/he is not looking for <br/>\nhis/her own identity as an individual and cannot embrace life completely <br/>\nwithout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to try to keep things in perspective. What we consider *health* in <br/>\nhomeopathy is the *freedom* to fulfill our dreams and live a rich and <br/>\ncreative life, in the pursuit of our higher purpose. This means freedom <br/>\nfrom disease, from fear, from traumatic experiences, from fixed ideas <br/>\nand rigid conceptions, from desructive relationships, and so on... In <br/>\nhomeopathy, health stops (and the disease process starts) when the flow <br/>\nof life, which is flexible, creative and loving gets stuck somewhere. In <br/>\nother words, when an individual is not in harmony inside and out.<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

I edited the school newspaper and frequently snuck in scathing editorials about the school&#39;s principal after the advisor had already signed off on the content.  Suspensions were frequently threatened.  I loved every minute of it-- partly for the drama, partly because there was nothing I liked more than seeing adults that I saw as being &quot;stupid&quot; getting all lathered up by something I&#39;d done.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Part of the learning to focus energy and *work* for change over *time* just comes from maturity-- I don&#39;t think that I really saw that change is a *process* and not an event until I had my own children.<br/>\n<br/>\n    What is he really interested in?  Is there some type of social change/ public awareness/ community activism project that he might become involved in?  Is there a group that he might join to pursue his agenda?  Could he start such a group?  Set up a website?  Start an underground newspaper?<br/>\n<br/>\n    I think that the most detrimental thing my parents did in dealing with me was trying to make me stop-- that just translated in my mind to more buttons that I was pushing... which was partially my aim anyway.  Not that I didn&#39;t feel strongly about the various issues-- but the button pushing was a nice added bonus for me. ;)  I think that if they had helped me find some way that I could express my dissatisfaction and exercise my need to be an activist, it would have been FAR more constructive... and I might have actually gotten into less trouble over the long haul.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I don&#39;t know if any of the above makes sense in the context of your family... I hope it does. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n    Teresa G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!

Us homeopaths think it&#39;s an imbalance. We all have <br/>\ndifferent temperaments, for sure, but clinical experience has shown us <br/>\nthat the aim of the vital force is to keep the body alive and motivate <br/>\nus to fulfill our dreams and higher purposes, along with a sense of <br/>\npeace and well being. So when the behavior is not aimed at that, we <br/>\nsuspect something triggered a reaction that is contrary to personal <br/>\nfulfillment and a positive, creative attitude in life.<br/>\nA behavioral problem in young people is just a sign of a greater, deeper <br/>\nimbalance that will usually show its ugly face time and again in the <br/>\nform of physical symptoms or more serious mental stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I insist so much on treating people homeopathically, and <br/>\nespecially kids. That way you are preventing other possible problems <br/>\nlater in life. Not to mention that the quality of life of anybody under <br/>\nhomeopathic treatment gets greatly improved.

I have learned<br/>\n&gt; to not panic, to get the facts, to listen a lot, to<br/>\n&gt; think before I speak, and to direct her toward ways to<br/>\n&gt; affect change in her world. To empower her to stand up<br/>\n&gt; and make her voice heard. I also accompany her to a<br/>\n&gt; lot of places that she goes. If she goes to any punk<br/>\n&gt; shows, I go too, carrying my nursing toddler in the<br/>\n&gt; sling. I stay in the background or outside (to protect<br/>\n&gt; my little one&#39;s hearing) but she knows I am nearby if<br/>\n&gt; she or her friends needs me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess we have had to let go of a lot. We never ever<br/>\n&gt; dreamed that one of our kids would go in this<br/>\n&gt; direction...but since it happened, we have decided to<br/>\n&gt; go with it. We provide a circle so to speak in which<br/>\n&gt; she can explore. Anything outside the circle has to be<br/>\n&gt; talked over with us and decisions made on a case by<br/>\n&gt; case basis....all to keep her safe and out of trouble.<br/>\n&gt; So far it has worked well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you mind me saying what kind of trouble your boy is<br/>\n&gt; interested in getting into? We have had to deal with a<br/>\n&gt; lot of attitude and emotional upheavel. I think though<br/>\n&gt; that some of that is the age. From about 12 - 17 is<br/>\n&gt; hard on them.

She<br/>\nhasn&#39;t gotten into any trouble but it is always<br/>\nlurking around in the back of my mind that those days<br/>\ncould be coming. She has many questions about<br/>\nanarchism, she is oppossed to racism, smoking, drugs,<br/>\nmaterialism, corporate America and she is vocal about<br/>\nthese convictions. She sets herself apart by her<br/>\nappearance also. She is a non-conformist all of the<br/>\nway. She doesn&#39;t have the maturity or life expereince<br/>\nto always be tactful or to really know how to put to<br/>\nuse al of her big ideas....which is where we come in. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times she has done things that we<br/>\nquestion....but we talk to her a lot. I have learned<br/>\nto not panic, to get the facts, to listen a lot, to<br/>\nthink before I speak, and to direct her toward ways to<br/>\naffect change in her world. To empower her to stand up<br/>\nand make her voice heard. I also accompany her to a<br/>\nlot of places that she goes. If she goes to any punk<br/>\nshows, I go too, carrying my nursing toddler in the<br/>\nsling. I stay in the background or outside (to protect<br/>\nmy little one&#39;s hearing) but she knows I am nearby if<br/>\nshe or her friends needs me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we have had to let go of a lot. We never ever<br/>\ndreamed that one of our kids would go in this<br/>\ndirection...but since it happened, we have decided to<br/>\ngo with it. We provide a circle so to speak in which<br/>\nshe can explore. Anything outside the circle has to be<br/>\ntalked over with us and decisions made on a case by<br/>\ncase basis....all to keep her safe and out of trouble.<br/>\nSo far it has worked well. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mind me saying what kind of trouble your boy is<br/>\ninterested in getting into? We have had to deal with a<br/>\nlot of attitude and emotional upheavel. I think though<br/>\nthat some of that is the age. From about 12 - 17 is<br/>\nhard on them. My daughter has grown 6 inches and<br/>\ngained 30 lbs....she went from a little girl to a<br/>\nyoung woman in the span of about 6 months. That alone<br/>\nis hard on a kid!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, keep listening and letting them talk.<br/>\nInterject when you can. Even when they don&#39;t seem to<br/>\nbe listening I think they are.
