Something that <br/>\nI have been doing since starting with unschooling in November is to <br/>\nlog the number of hours that my kids socialize. Amazingly, I see the <br/>\ntime going up, compared to when they were in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nA parent of a ps student told me flat out that I was exaggerating <br/>\nbecause &quot;all the time in school the kids are socializing&quot; I wonder if <br/>\nthis parent spends much time in the classroom and sees what happens <br/>\nwhen children try to socialize in class ... they get ridiculed or <br/>\nworse, put in the hallway. I will grant that they do get to freely <br/>\nsocialize on the playground for about 1 1/2 hour during the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I feel less stressed with the kids being at home and because <br/>\nthey don&#39;t have homework at night, I allow their friends to come over <br/>\nalmost every night. They socialize between 3 and 5 hours a day during <br/>\nthe week and as many as 12 hours per day on the weekends, not <br/>\nincluding the nights they have sleepovers. How much more social do <br/>\nthey need to be???<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also been fed the argument that my kids won&#39;t be able to <br/>\nidentify with their ps buddies as they won&#39;t have the same <br/>\nexperiences and won&#39;t have any reason to maintain their relationships <br/>\n(eg. school dances, field trips etc.) To this I respond, that I have <br/>\nkept in contact with a grand total of 1 (one) friend from my <br/>\njunior/senior high school years out of the 600 people I graduated <br/>\nwith. The school environment did not help me foster life-long <br/>\nfriendships.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids didn&#39;t play with kids from their ps school anyway.
