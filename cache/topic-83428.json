I have a letter he wrote me when I was a teenager, and he signed <br/>\nit &quot;Dady.&quot;  (There being no long-a word, he figured once there are enough <br/>\nletters to pronounce it correctly, he&#39;d done his job.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Keith and my dad were lefties.

His handwriting is <br/>\njerky lefthanded small writing.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome words he&#39;s learned because he uses them a lot.  &quot;Committee&quot; finally <br/>\nsettled for him.

I wasn&#39;t five years ago or any time before that. I have <br/>\nbecome a better speller with the help of spell check! There are common <br/>\nmisspelled words and words that I commonly misspell. With spell check I have learned <br/>\nwhat those words are and when I come across them now, I can spell them. Five <br/>\nyears ago, or even fewer, I couldn&#39;t do that. The constant review, for me, was <br/>\nwhat did it. Someone would then ask if this worked, then why didn&#39;t the <br/>\nconstant review in school work? I have an answer for that! In school the review of <br/>\nspelling is done in lists. Ten new words a week with a test on Friday. <br/>\nAbsolutely no use of the words in everyday application. Here, I use a word, I always <br/>\nmisspell it, spell checker catches it, after a few times I see that word <br/>\nspelled correctly and I begin to spell it correctly. After a few more times, I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee that word on the spell checker again. If I were the school at home type, <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t use spelling programs. I would take words from the books my kids <br/>\nwere reading and words from their journals from other subjects and have them <br/>\nkeep a common place book just like people used to do hundreds of years ago.
