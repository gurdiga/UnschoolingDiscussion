If DS doesn&#39;t like it then he can have<br/>\nmore of what he does like (I always make sure part of it is a favorite, as<br/>\nlong as its still nutritious).  But he&#39;s getting good at just eating what I<br/>\nmake because he doesn&#39;t like being hungry, and after several attempts he<br/>\nends up liking the stuff.  Of course, he&#39;s not quite 3 yet and we&#39;ve been<br/>\nvery careful with what he eats so far so he&#39;s pretty good about what he<br/>\nlikes.<br/>\nWe&#39;re trying to increase the amount of raw foods in our diet, right now<br/>\nwe&#39;re at about 25% raw foods.  We probably won&#39;t ever go completely<br/>\nvegetarian, but we eat little meat, but we try to get in a lot of protein<br/>\nand not so much of the filler carbs (potatos, rice, breads, etc) though we<br/>\nstill eat some ... we&#39;ve noticed marked difference in our energy levels and<br/>\nDS&#39;s behavior.  Now that we&#39;re in the middle of moving I haven&#39;t been able<br/>\nto do much cooking or anything and our diet, well, sucks :)  And I&#39;ve<br/>\nalready gained back weight I had lost and am back to feeling sluggish and my<br/>\nskin problems are getting worse (acne & severe dry skin).
