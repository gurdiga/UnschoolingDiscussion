How much does the quality of your handwriting really affect<br/>\nyour life? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to my addiction to the internet &lt;g&gt;, I was a doodler.  I would practice different styles of print and cursive.  I had many beautiful styles of writing.  Did this matter in my life, not one iota.   Never was my handwriting praised in one of my performance evaluations.  However, the doodling did allow me to center myself (meditation?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho, since I have become a puter junkie, my writing has gone down the toilet.  However, my typing skills have increased exponentially.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Mowery<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MI-unschoolers@onelist.com\">MI-unschoolers@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1914,"nextTopicId":1953}}
