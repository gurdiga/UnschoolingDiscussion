We are about 2/3rds of our way toward the goal,<br/>\nand with three more weeks until South India&#39;s Thanksgiving (Pongal), I<br/>\nam confident we will reach it. (for those of you who wish to learn more<br/>\nabout Pongal, here&#39;s a link --<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/9542/pongal.html\">http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/9542/pongal.html</a>  )<br/>\n<br/>\nI have spoken with my family in South India, and they are excited!  They<br/>\nand the villagers are quite aware of the cyclone devastation to the<br/>\nnorth of them which occurred this year, and know that it is only a<br/>\nmatter of time before the cyclones return to the South.  To be able to<br/>\nbuild their own houses now will be like providing emergency assistance<br/>\nBEFORE it happens -- and with a bonus of a clean, dry home in addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nTax deductible contributions are still being accepted -- for this year,<br/>\ndate the check before the turn of the millenium; for next year, practice<br/>\nyour zeros.  You are all welcome to copy the original appeal, which I&#39;ve<br/>\nattached below, and send it on to friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all best wishes for peace, in this, the Season of Peace,<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid H. Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\n                         A THANKSGIVING APPEAL<br/>\n                            November 25, 1999<br/>\n<br/>\nDear friends �<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of you who know me from homeschooling circles, Quaker or<br/>\ninterreligious service work, or are just plain ol� friends, have heard<br/>\nme wax eloquent about the work of my adopted Indian parents in far south<br/>\nof India in the state of Tamil Nadu � S. and Krishnamal Jaganathan. I<br/>\napologize in advance for this appeal but, as I hope you will see, it is<br/>\nheartfelt and much needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father is now 89, mother 73 � they have worked uninterruptedly as<br/>\nGandhian land reform organizers, trying to bring land to the landless<br/>\npoor, for some 50 years.  And after about 30 years, their work began to<br/>\nbear fruit. Through an inventive combination of loans, nonviolent action<br/>\n(to get government land ceiling laws enforced), friendly persuasion, and<br/>\njust plain hard work, through their organization Land for the Tillers<br/>\nFreedom, they have helped 11,000 agricultural families come to own their<br/>\nown land � most of whom had been landless for more than 40 generations.<br/>\nThe land is held either in cooperatives, or by women (the men have been<br/>\nknown to sell it to pay for drink), provides for the basic needs of the<br/>\nfamily, with enough left over to support small cottage industries.  I<br/>\nhave visited regularly since 1977 and, quite frankly, it is a miracle!<br/>\nThey have been nominated for the International Right Livelihood Award,<br/>\nand Women�s World Summit Foundation in Switzerland just gave my mother<br/>\ntheir prize for �Women�s Creativity in Rural Life�, calling her �a<br/>\nGandhian Joan of Arc�.  Whenever I am there, I get introduced to all my<br/>\n�relatives�, as she is considered mother by all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last 3 years, they have had to fight another battle � against<br/>\nmultinational corporations who had set up prawn farms that were<br/>\ndestroying the coastal ecology, salinating and polluting the soil,<br/>\ndestroying the mangroves protecting against the cyclone winds.  My<br/>\nfather�s case ended up in the Indian Supreme Court � he and his one<br/>\nlawyer against 116 lawyers representing the multinationals.  He won �<br/>\nthe Supreme Court ordered all the prawn farms in fragile coastal areas<br/>\nclosed -- but quite literally lost his eyes in the process.  The<br/>\ngovernment threatened to pass a law overturning the Supreme Court order,<br/>\nwhile he was having an eye operation.  He signed himself out of<br/>\npost-operative recovery 10 days early, traveled 2,000 miles via train in<br/>\n110 degree summer heat, and set up a fast at the Gandhi Memorial in New<br/>\nDelhi.  The government backed down, but his eyes never recovered.  And<br/>\nthis year, after a series of nonviolent actions and fasts involving<br/>\nthousands of people, he got the order enforced, at least in the district<br/>\nwhere their land reform activities have taken place.  I have come to<br/>\nlearn that when my father acts as Don Quixote going up against the<br/>\nwindmill, I wouldn�t bet on the windmill!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the middle of all of this, my mother also collects stray children.<br/>\nLiterally.  She picks them off garbage heaps, roaming the streets,<br/>\nbegging in bus stations.  (A boy I personally  support was found hanging<br/>\nfrom a tree by one foot, placed there by an abusive father.) She now has<br/>\n120 of them, (46 at my �home�) who she feeds, clothes, houses, sends to<br/>\nschool, and finds what love she can for them.  We�ve managed to find<br/>\nfamilies in Italy to �adopt� them and pay for their expenses. Last year<br/>\nwhen I was in India, I raised money (my own and some friends) to deepen<br/>\nthe well next to the house, so the kids could plant 200 new coconut and<br/>\npapaya trees � they help plant and harvest rice, care for six<br/>\nmilk-giving cows and water buffaloes, and grow vegetables (all in<br/>\naddition to their school work), so they can help feed themselves.  My<br/>\nmother and father live simply (on around $70 a month) � since 1939, my<br/>\nfather has spun the cotton for every article of clothing he has worn<br/>\n(luckily, he doesn�t need much clothing). So their own needs are<br/>\nminimal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we have a need, and that�s why I am appealing for help.  The 11,000<br/>\nfamilies now have land, but their houses are made of mud and straw, and<br/>\nwhen the cyclones come (as they did north of them this year), the houses<br/>\nare virtually all destroyed.  They leak during the monsoon rains (which<br/>\nhappen twice year), and the kids end up sleeping on the wet ground. My<br/>\nmother�s dream is to house them all decently, or more correctly, have<br/>\nthem house themselves.  She has a well-developed plan whereby she can<br/>\nstart a cottage industry making cinder blocks, sell enough of the blocks<br/>\non the open market to cover raw material costs, and have the people<br/>\nbuild their own homes with the bricks they make themselves.  But she<br/>\n(we!) need just under $5,500 for a brickmaking machine (and the people�s<br/>\nability to access loans is already too stretched by payments on the<br/>\nland.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have received sponsorship from the Gandhian Foundation, a 501(c)(3)<br/>\ncharitable organization based in New Jersey to receive funds for the<br/>\nproject (which I desperately want to get started after this year�s rice<br/>\nharvest festival � the South Indian equivalent of Thanksgiving, around<br/>\nJanuary 20 � after the harvest, people are free to pursue cottage<br/>\nindustries, and build homes.  I plan to contribute significantly from<br/>\nwhat income I make from my book (And the Skylark Sings with Me), and my<br/>\nkids are counting their pennies, too.  THERE ARE NO ADMINISTRATIVE<br/>\nEXPENSES RELATED TO THIS PROJECT.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, tax deductible donations (large and small) will be deeply, deeply<br/>\nappreciated.  They should be made out to the Gandhian Foundation, and<br/>\nmailed to me:<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\nSkylark Sings<br/>\n1717 18th Court NE<br/>\nOlympia, WA 98506<br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope you will seriously consider this appeal. Thanks very much<br/>\nindeed, and have a joyful, prayerful, truly meaningful thanksgiving and<br/>\nwhat it means to live in a land where there truly is enough for us all.<br/>\nIf you require more info., e-mail me at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shantinik@...\">shantinik@...</a>  Please<br/>\nfeel free to share this appeal with others as you think appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n(P.S.  If there are homeschoolers who want to know more about India,<br/>\netc. � we�d be happy to help � we might also be able to arrange for<br/>\nIndian penpals -- though I can�t promise this for sure � you have to<br/>\nremember, the kids we are supporting are just becoming literate in their<br/>\nown languages, and most struggle with their English.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nGreg Bates says &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me is to homeschooling what<br/>\nTom Paine&#39;s Common Sense was to the American Revolution.&quot; To read a<br/>\nsample chapter, reviewers&#39; comments, or the foreword, and to order<br/>\n(cheaper than Amazon, and I&#39;ll sign it for you too!), visit my website<br/>\nat <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skylarksings.com\">http://www.skylarksings.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5404,"nextTopicId":5413}}
