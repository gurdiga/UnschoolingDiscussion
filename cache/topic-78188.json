(no caffeine, <br/>\nthough.) eat more fresh fruits & vegetables, less simple carbs.<br/>\n<br/>\n-hatha yoga classes. (emphasis on *class*, not just a video, <br/>\nespecially for beginners. i&#39;m a former iyengar yoga teacher and feel <br/>\nit&#39;s very important to have proper personalized guidance to attain <br/>\nmaximum benefit from yogasana and to avoid strain or injury.) <br/>\n<br/>\n-acupuncture. i can&#39;t tell you what a difference this makes for me! <br/>\nit lifts my mood, keeps my head clearer and gives me more energy. my <br/>\nhealth insurance actually covers a huge chunk of the cost, too! <br/>\nduring the 8 weeks that i was neither pregnant nor breastfeeding in <br/>\nthe last 5 years, my L.Ac. put me on adrenal-supportive herbs that <br/>\nhelped me tremendously. (massage is also fantastic, and some health <br/>\ninsurance plans cover that too! boy, would i love to start one day <br/>\neach week with a massage!)<br/>\n<br/>\n-sharing the weight. my mother-in-law just moved in with us 3 weeks <br/>\nago. before then, we had no family locally, and all of our friends <br/>\nwere moving out-of-state one after another. i&#39;d spent the better part <br/>\nof 5 years with no babysitter, no &quot;dates&quot; with hubby, no helping hand <br/>\naround the house unless hubby was available and little social <br/>\ninteraction. (we&#39;re a one-vehicle family and it for the last year <br/>\nhasn&#39;t been practical for me to take hubby to work so i can have the <br/>\nvan. it&#39;s been a rough year!) MIL&#39;s living with us is a temporary <br/>\narrangement, just until she gets her own place in this area (which is <br/>\nwell in the works). so she won&#39;t always be here to wash my dishes <br/>\nevery night, but she will be just across town when i need an extra <br/>\nhand or a little &quot;me time&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat *didn&#39;t* help me, oddly enough, is counseling. maybe i had a bad <br/>\ncounselor or just didn&#39;t really need it, but it was such a huge waste <br/>\nof my time and money.<br/>\n<br/>\nif you can give your depression a name that will allow the energy to <br/>\nmove outward (eg, &quot;anger&quot;), that can help tremendously too. i&#39;ve <br/>\ndecided to face the fact that i&#39;m absolutely furious about a lot of <br/>\nthings in my past and present situations. my acupuncturist (who is a <br/>\ntrained jungian analyst) said i should wear a lot of red. well, i had <br/>\nalmost no red whatsoever in my wardrobe so i did some shopping, and i <br/>\nmust say i&#39;m very glad i did! it&#39;s subtle, but color therapy does <br/>\nmake a noticeable difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nit also helps me to get creative. make stuff. draw, paint, write, <br/>\nmake origami mobiles, whatever. this can be interesting with the kids <br/>\naround, as i really prefer to have my own creative space. so i either <br/>\ngive them a project or their own, or wait until they are busy or <br/>\nasleep to dive into my creative work.<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, i hope some of that inspires you. and if not, just know that <br/>\nsomeone else out there understands the sort of thing you&#39;re going <br/>\nthrough, and is sending pleasant thoughts & &quot;vibes&quot; your way. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nyou mentioned hormones needing tweaking. are you estrogen dominant? <br/>\ni&#39;ve been meaning to get to a local ND recommended by my L.Ac. to get <br/>\nmy hormone levels tested and see about getting myself on a good <br/>\nprogesterone cream. i get the impression that&#39;s the sort of thing you <br/>\nwere referring to. if you try it, would you let me know your <br/>\nexperience? i&#39;ve heard a lot of praises about natural progesterone <br/>\ncream and am really intrigued.<br/>\n<br/>\ntake care!<br/>\n--<br/>\nstacie<br/>\nwiped-out, frazzled, but loving mama to:<br/>\nzoÃ« - 5 yrs<br/>\nmadilyn - almost 4 yrs<br/>\ngavin - 13 mos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Heather Hall <br/>\n&lt;Heatherette@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wow, way ahead of you there!

My adrenals are <br/>\nshot, my liver is trying to play catch up, had surgery while I was <br/>\npregnant with Crispin, had to quit nursing at 8 weeks, been driving to <br/>\nthe farm every week for over a year to get raw milk to make his formula <br/>\nfrom scratch so I don&#39;t have to feed him Nastie.  I still consider it <br/>\nwhining, but I do come from a fair amount of crap to whine about.  <br/>\nMostly got it resolved now - I mean I feel close to normal.  It&#39;s <br/>\nmostly tweaking the hormones at this point and I think I found the <br/>\nright person to help me with that finally.  I knew it was that from the <br/>\nvery beginning, but the stupid docs kept telling me I was bi-polar and <br/>\nmy thyroid was fine!  I never asked *once* about my stupid thyroid!  <br/>\nThey just listened with closed ears, cost me my nursing relationship <br/>\nand a year of parenting.<br/>\nWow!
