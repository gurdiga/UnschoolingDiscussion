As wonderful as they may be, my sibs and parents are not as family oriented as *i* would like them to be, thus I am the one reaching out to maintain relationships between kids and grandparents, aunts and uncles, and cousins.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me living in an area with many homeschoolers, a good number of unschooling families and many relaxed homeschoolers is paramount.  When we talk about possible moves to new locations, my first priority is being part of a larger and eclectic homeschooling community.  My kids are very social as I am, and we need to be around others who do like us so as not to feel crazy and weird, etc.  Not to say we don&#39;t engage with our local nonhomeschooling community - we most definately do.  And as much as i like time to myself or being with just my family, we crave socialization and socialization where we feel accepted and comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s my 2cents.  I know your concern was more about in town or out of town, but other comments you made raised flags.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166215589,"authorName":"Mattamandab@aol.com","from":"Mattamandab@...","profile":"amandabokus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"rural areas/ small towns/ friends (long)","postDate":"1083715635","msgId":93467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NC4yODc4ODg4NC4yZGM5OGEzM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93564,"prevInTime":93466,"nextInTime":93468,"topicId":93467,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi again!
