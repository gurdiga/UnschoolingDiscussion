See our Pain in the\nGas page.\n<p>here&#39;s an excerpt from their &#39;Pain in the Gas page&#39;:\n<p>Origins:&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s time for the second annual &quot;gas out,&quot; the\nsame non-event that was staged last year, though this time\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stretched out to cover a three-day\nperiod instead of just the one day (April 30) in 1999.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even those who are usually level-headed\nand have little problem waving off the emotions of the moment to see through\nto\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the logical inconsistencies of\nwhatever the latest bit of rabble-rousing is pushing are having a hard\ntime with this one. Gas\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prices are much higher than we&#39;re\nused to seeing them, and perhaps this triggers horrible memories left over\nfrom the oil\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embargo of the 1970s. Whatever\nthe reason, those whose blood is boiling over current gas prices are determined\nto see as\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a legitimate boycott what&#39;s nothing\nmore than a misdirected expression of anger.\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By definition, a boycott involves\nthe doing without of something, with the swearing off of the boycotted\nproduct held up as\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tangible proof to those who usually\nsupply the commodity that consumers are prepared to do without unless changes\nare\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made. What the gas-out calls for\nisn&#39;t a swearing off of gasoline, but of buying gasoline, and that&#39;s a\nkey difference. The\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same amount of gas will be run\nthrough the cars of the &quot;boycotters&quot; during the gas-out even if the gas\nisn&#39;t purchased on\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those days. Because consumers\naren&#39;t planning to do without gas, the threat is empty, and those who control\nthe taps will\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know that. ...\n<p>you can find the rest of the article @ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/gasout.htm\">http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/gasout.htm</a>\n<p>-susan\n<br>austin,tx\n<br>&#39;unity through diversity&#39;\n<p>&nbsp;Ron and Stephanie wrote:\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\">From: &quot;Ron and Stephanie&quot; &lt;ronandstphanie@...&gt;\n<p>Just buy gas on Tuesdays, and it appears that you will be fine.
