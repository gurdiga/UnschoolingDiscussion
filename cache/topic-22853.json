Zoe quit camp on her own on Monday. I kept <br/>\ntelling dh I wasn&#39;t real thrilled w/ what was coming home. <br/>\nTeasing,taunting,treating us like 5 yr olds basically. Zoe is very reserved <br/>\nso she watched everything then brought it home to try it out. We eventually <br/>\nresorted to threats about the pool but soon gave that up b/c as we all know <br/>\nthis doesn&#39;t work. the kid behaves to get what they want not b/c they respect <br/>\nyou any more than before.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Also dh witnessed unattentive counselors and this sold him on quitting.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I agree socialization is really out in the world and it works better. i <br/>\nplan to try and find others to get together w/ and we can supervise <br/>\nbehaviors. Also we may try the private school camp. I watched these children <br/>\nat the library one day and there was no back biting and stealing and <br/>\nsuch.Adults are the counselors there.<br/>\n<br/>\n   i do blame myself alot b/c I signed her up for this camp b/c it started <br/>\nearlier and I needed the time to train for a goal. Selfish I know but she <br/>\nalso was dieing to play w/ others then again when ever I picked her up she <br/>\nwas playing alone. Most of the kids new eachother from daycare and preschool. <br/>\nAt 5 they tend to stick together and like only one other playpal. 3 is <br/>\ndefinitely a crowd at this age.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Oh and while I was away dh took her to a friends house to play w/ her 2 <br/>\nyounger brothers 4 and 6 and he said they had an absolute blast and never got <br/>\nnasty or rude. Unfortunately these boys live here and in another state so it <br/>\nis sporadic.:o(<br/>\n<br/>\n   OK enough of my 2 cents. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22846,"nextTopicId":22867}}
