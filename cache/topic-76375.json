The &quot;unschooling&quot; aspect of education is identical, really, to <br/>\nUnschooling at Home. The big difference is Family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSudbury Schools downplay family (specifically parents).  That&#39;s noty to <br/>\nsuggest that they incite rebellion, but more that during the school day, parents <br/>\nare not really a factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Nick, being a round a bunch of like-minded kids is important, and he is <br/>\nvery happy there. He has no interest in homeschooling. I asked Julian if he <br/>\nthought that, if we lived in CT, he would want to attend the Sudbury School, if <br/>\nonly to be with Nick.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said that if for some reason he had to go to school, he&#39;d want it to be a <br/>\nSudbury School, but that being with his parents was most important to him. <br/>\nJulian&#39;s not a terribly social kid (not anti-social in any way, and meeting him, <br/>\nyou&#39;d probably be surprised to hear he wasn&#39;t very social), and he likes being <br/>\nwith his mama. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...a plug...we adore Nick, and like most Sudbury schools his is struggling. <br/>\nIf you know people in the Greater Hartford area who might be interested, give <br/>\nme a howl. It&#39;s really important his school survives!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76225,"nextTopicId":76390}}
