I live <br/>\nin Japan - I&#39;m American, dh is Japanese, and ds (2yr - his real name is <br/>\nMichael, but we call him Mook) is both.  At first, about three months <br/>\nago, I started looking online for homeschooling resources because I was <br/>\nplanning to teach my son English and stuff after school.  The more I <br/>\nresearched, the more interested I became until I decided to try to teach <br/>\nmy son at home (which is basically illegal here, but a very few do it <br/>\nanyway, and are constantly hounded by child abuse and neglect <br/>\n&quot;authorities.&quot;).  Now, I&#39;m convinced I can not teach, but just help <br/>\nlearn, and I have never enjoyed being a mother more.  These have been <br/>\nthe best three months of our lives.  Mook is only two, but we&#39;ve <br/>\npursued HIS interests, and his knowledge of bulldozers and other power <br/>\nmachines is incredible.  I think he must know everything there is to <br/>\nknow about them (except how to operate one, of course, though he did ask <br/>\nme to let him learn), and my own knowledge has grown.  I never thought <br/>\nlearning anything was worthwhile, and hated school.  But I went to <br/>\npublic schools from pre-school to college, and, well, I still have not <br/>\ncompletely detoxed yet...:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to the park and collect leaves and watch the moon rise - just <br/>\nenjoy life as it comes.  While other mothers take their two year olds to <br/>\ncram schools to learn to read and write and do math (as most mothers do <br/>\nin Japan), Mook and I go outside and play soccer.  While the other kids <br/>\nare watching tv, Mook and I are reading about power shovels or airplanes <br/>\ntogether.  While other kids go to day care, Mook and I go for walks.  We <br/>\nreally enjoy our life together - even more so because I&#39;m not just <br/>\nwaiting &#39;til he&#39;s old enough to send him to school and get him out of <br/>\nthe house.  I&#39;m not trying to make him smarter than the kid next door.  <br/>\nBut he does seem a lot happier.  That&#39;s what&#39;s important to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re saving up to move to the States, but don&#39;t know where or when.  I <br/>\nlooked up homeschooling laws on the internet, and Idaho seems to have <br/>\nthe best - just do it - no papers or authorities - don&#39;t even have to <br/>\ntell anyone.  So we&#39;re thinking about there.  Somewhere away from the <br/>\ncity - a place where we can go exploring, climb trees, go camping, etc. <br/>\nin our own backyard.  We&#39;ve got to find a job first, and internet <br/>\nsearches and job services have not turned up anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pregnant due in early November, and Mook is learning a little about <br/>\npregnancy and likes to go with me to the doctor and see the baby on the <br/>\nultrasound.  He learns about whatever he likes - today he taught his <br/>\nstuffed animals how to play soccer.  Mook won...:-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is very supportive of my homeschooling, but not sure about <br/>\nunschooling - not that I have to tell him.  When he asks what we learned <br/>\ntoday, I just tell him what we did in eduspeak, and he never knows any <br/>\ndifferent.  He thinks learning can only take place in front of a text <br/>\nbook (never mind that I learned to speak and read Japanese by being <br/>\nhere and reading the back of the shampoo bottle - not from a text book).  <br/>\nWe often take &quot;field trips&quot; to the store, or to an appointment, or <br/>\nwhatever.  One day on the way home from the park, Mook stopped me so we <br/>\ncould watch power shovels at a nearby construction site for two hours.  <br/>\n(Another field trip.)  He kept telling me what the machines were doing, <br/>\nand the names of the parts of them - how they were being used, that kind <br/>\nof thing.  I never knew a two year old could be so smart.  But I guess <br/>\nthey don&#39;t teach about bulldozers at cram school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to get past the &quot;authorities,&quot; we&#39;ve established our own <br/>\n&quot;school.&quot;  We&#39;re working on it - getting a website, printing special <br/>\nschool letterhead stationary - selecting an official name.  We&#39;re <br/>\nthinking about &quot;St. Michael&#39;s American Academy.&quot;  hehe  It&#39;s working so <br/>\nfar.  But the law doesn&#39;t require him to be in school until he&#39;s six, so <br/>\nwe&#39;ll see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, time for our &quot;cooking class.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80,"nextTopicId":260}}
