My 7 yr old, 8 in Feb.  is not reading.  Can sound out a few 3<br/>\nletter<br/>\nwords, but that&#39;s it.  While all the other kids his age in our group are<br/>\nreading chapter books.  Ugh!  I&#39;m just trying to be quite, and not think<br/>\nabout<br/>\nit if he is fine with it.<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, your son sounds perfectly normal to me. Isn&#39;t 8-12 the average for<br/>\nboys to start reading if left to do it naturally?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2nd daughter is 8-1/2 and is reading only haltingly. She is absolutely<br/>\ndetermined to read Harry Potter (which we already read aloud...we are really<br/>\nbehind the times...we&#39;re only on the 2nd book now). She sits there every day<br/>\nand slowly but surely reads that book. She&#39;s so proud when she finishes a<br/>\nchapter. Must be a pain to be the younger sister of a book devourer. But I<br/>\nknow she&#39;s going at her natural pace so I try to tell her not to worry about<br/>\nit that she isn&#39;t as fast as others her age. At least she won&#39;t develop a<br/>\nfear or hatred of reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Valerie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n I am new to this list and had to jump in here. I am<br/>\nSO glad to know that I am not the only one with a late<br/>\nreader. My middle son will be 8 in Dec. and is still<br/>\nstruggling to read. He can read the first couple Bob<br/>\nbooks and that is about it.<br/>\n Today he knows his alphabet and sounds, tomorrow he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. It is so fustrating because he is so advanced<br/>\nin just about everything he does except reading.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13756,"nextTopicId":13760}}
