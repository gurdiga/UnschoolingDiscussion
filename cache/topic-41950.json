You<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a child in school. You don&#39;t even have a child at home. You are<br/>\nnot struggling with the decision on whether to take your child out of school<br/>\nor not or what method to use to homeschool them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only conceivable reason I can think for your asking is that your trying<br/>\nto bring &quot;testimonials&quot; to the list so the rest of us will finally &quot;get&quot;<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not an &quot;us&quot; that needs someone whose been there and done that to ask<br/>\nour questions for us. (That&#39;s feeling awfully schoolish to me.) Those of<br/>\n&quot;us&quot; who want to know will ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&quot; are also not an &quot;us&quot; because you are not currently unschooling a child.<br/>\nIt&#39;s unfortunate to point that out since it could make others who aren&#39;t<br/>\nunschooling a child feel uncomfomtable about being here or posting, but<br/>\nsince you repeatedly insist that your concerns must be our concerns, it<br/>\napparently needs to be pointed out. Someone who is not of (or not<br/>\nconsidering becoming part of) the demographic a list is set up for should<br/>\npolitely sit back and respect the natural flow of the conversation of those<br/>\nwho are of the demographic. People have said your experiences as an<br/>\nunschooling father that are relevant to questions asked are more than<br/>\nwelcome. They do address the concerns of the demographic.
