Videos, much better, because you can rewind and watch again and <br/>\npause to discuss.  Someone can watch it all again after the group is done.  <br/>\nConversations and comparisons will come up for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been watching all Sam Rockwell&#39;s movies.  I&#39;m not in a big hurry, but <br/>\nit&#39;s a project.  Some I&#39;m getting on DVD from Netflix.  They&#39;re not all <br/>\nthings I&#39;m keen to share with kids, but I do show them some good parts.  <br/>\nJerry and Tom is about violence and stupidity, but the scene changes are <br/>\nreally artsy, and some of the scenes (although violent and stupid) are <br/>\ninteresting, and funny.  And the acting is good.  So that&#39;s just for me, not <br/>\nfor me-and-kids.  But I did show my husband one scene in which Ted Danson has <br/>\na dramatic monolog, and there&#39;s a movie showing (made as part of the <br/>\nproduction, so that the scenes fit in with the dialog) and that was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther ways to get kids relaxed and talking are just games, toys, puzzles you <br/>\ncan work with them.  Riding in a car.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an essay I wrote a few years ago which was lost (sort of) for a while, <br/>\nbut it on line now.
