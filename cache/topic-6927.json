I like the idea of making it into an<br/>\n<br/>\nengrossing tale I can share with them.  It just seems to me this is one area<br/>\n<br/>\nwhere natural learning might require a lot of &quot;homework&quot; on my part!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat a great concept!  i like this approach!  and storytelling can be so <br/>\ncompelling.  it wouldnt hurt me much to go this route since there is so much <br/>\ni&#39;d like to learn that i missed or that wasnt presented...  i remember a <br/>\nsubstitute teacher in highschool that was such a mess she would regularly be <br/>\nin tears instead of teaching class... what a joke-- sad, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, i have been thinking that just to continue to collect resources that <br/>\nare of interest to us in this area as in others, and read and share as it <br/>\nhappens.  you hear of the &quot;chronological approach&quot; etc, but it is all too <br/>\ncontrived and i am not yet convinced of the value of presenting it in a <br/>\nparticular order just for the benefit of learning it better.  it seems to me <br/>\nwe would do just as well to read what we like and then try to place it in <br/>\ncontext (with a timeline or similar discussion..)  <br/>\n<br/>\ni end up feeling, like with other areas, that there is just so much to <br/>\ncover/learn about content wise...  but collecting good resources so that our <br/>\nenvironment has the tools that we need when something comes up has always <br/>\nworked so far, so at this point that is where i am headed.<br/>\n<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6821,"nextTopicId":6928}}
