These are things that<br/>\nthey may or may not be able to participate in outside of school.  If you<br/>\nlive in a smaller population base, like we do, than you have less access to<br/>\nalternative activities outside of ps.  Also, if the child has a strong ego<br/>\nand enjoys being in the spotlight, they may benefit greatly from the large<br/>\naudience in ps.  These are the kind of kids who are really into student<br/>\ngovernment, cheerleading, dance committees, and other organizational and<br/>\nhighly public endeavors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLet us not forget that there are also good teachers out there.
