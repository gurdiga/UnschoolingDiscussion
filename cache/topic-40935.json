I thought <br/>\nsome of you might have a message for this person.....I did respond <br/>\nand would be happy to pass her email only to those interested in <br/>\nletting her know the truth about HSLDA. All I can think is GAG!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Gruvystarchild, Greetings, I read your letter and when my <br/>\nchildren were younger I was greatful to have someone out there <br/>\nwatching out for my interest re: home schooling, because like you I <br/>\ncould not put the time forward. Now my children are much older and I <br/>\nstill feel blessed to have HSLDA watching my back along with every <br/>\nother homeschool family, yet now I am able to also help advocate <br/>\nalong side them and other groups who believe in our rights to home <br/>\nschool.Here in the US states HSLDA fights hard to preserve our right <br/>\nto homeschool. I know personally families that they helped when being <br/>\nharrassed by school officials. Without them one of these families <br/>\nwould have complied and sent thier son back to public school.  HSLDA <br/>\nis in Washington DC fighting to preserve our rights as home schoolers <br/>\nand continually monitoring the laws that affect home schoolers. With <br/>\nall due respect, I am an advocate for HSLDA because without them many <br/>\npeople would just sit back and let the goverment, state and city <br/>\nofficials tell us what we can and cannot do when it come to educating <br/>\nour children at home.  A perfect example is prayer taken out of <br/>\nschool, no one stood up and wham, it was accomplished and the same <br/>\nwith the Pledge Allegiance, thank God though we have people fighting <br/>\nfor this one. Take care and God bless, Mary W.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40905,"nextTopicId":40936}}
