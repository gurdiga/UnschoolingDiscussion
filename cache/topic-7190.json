I either come up with <br/>\n14 million matches, or 2-3 matches that have nothing to do with what I was <br/>\nlooking for.  Sounds like I need to work on that.  Anyhoo, in the meantime, <br/>\ncan anyone point me to some good sites about geometry for beginners?  My 8 yo <br/>\nhas discovered that he LOOOOVES geometry and would like to do more.  He&#39;s <br/>\nalready found and completed all the geometry pages in every workbook in the <br/>\nhouse, and is looking for more.   He&#39;s a geometry junkie!  When I look back <br/>\non my godawful geometry experience in PS, I am so happy for him that he can <br/>\nenjoy it happily.  Thanks in advance for any pointers you may have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPax et bonum, <br/>\nKIM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7189,"nextTopicId":7188}}
