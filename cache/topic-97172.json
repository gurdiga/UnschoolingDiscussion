In<br/>\n&gt; their work with hundreds of children and adults, the Piepers discovered that<br/>\n&gt; when discipline and excessive expectations are imposed on young children, they<br/>\n&gt; learn to equate feelings of unhappiness with loving relationships. This<br/>\n&gt; misidentification persists into adulthood and explains why so many adults<br/>\n&gt; create unhappiness in the process of seeking happiness and love. This<br/>\n&gt; unrecognized self-sabotage is the explanation for diverse yet common problems<br/>\n&gt; such as overspending, fear of new situations, romantic choices that break<br/>\n&gt; hearts, and career mishaps. Addicted to Unhappiness offers a plan for life<br/>\n&gt; that helps readers understand their secret need to be unhappy, overcome it,<br/>\n&gt; and reclaim the happiness that is their true birthright. In the process, they<br/>\n&gt; will learn to conquer health problems including destructive moods, overeating<br/>\n&gt; and lack of exercise; build strong, lasting relationships; and achieve career<br/>\n&gt; satisfaction and success.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Heather wanting specifics","postDate":"1091409413","msgId":97172,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYy40N2U2NDViOS4yZTNlZjAwNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":97176,"prevInTime":97171,"nextInTime":97173,"topicId":97172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/1/04 6:47:48 PM, Heatherette@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-966333683\">In a message dated 8/1/04 6:47:48 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Heatherette@...\">Heatherette@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  What do I do in the<br/>\nmeantime to cope?
