A spelling different from the one in current use.<br/>\n<br/>\n   2. Use of the same letter(s) to convey different sounds,<br/>\n      for example, gh in rough and ghost.<br/>\n<br/>\n[From Greek hetero (different) + -graphy (writing).]<br/>\n<br/>\n   The idea of heterography is a recent phenomenon, relatively speaking.<br/>\n   Earlier, when English was mainly a spoken language, it was a free-for-all,<br/>\n   spelling-wise. Any spelling was good as long as you could make yourself<br/>\n   understood. Each writer spelled words in his own way, trying to spell<br/>\n   them phonetically. Shakespeare spelled his own name in various ways<br/>\n   (Shaxspear, Shakespear, and so on).<br/>\n<br/>\n   If you read old manuscripts, you can find different spellings of a word<br/>\n   on the same page, and sometimes even in the same sentence. Spelling wasn&#39;t<br/>\n   something sacrosanct: if a line was too long to fit, a typesetter might<br/>\n   simply squeeze or expand the word by altering the spelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n   If the idea of to-each-one&#39;s-own spelling for the same word sounds bizarre,<br/>\n   consider how we practice it even today, in the only place we can: in our<br/>\n   names. Look around you and you might find a Christina and a Cristina and<br/>\n   a Kristina and many other permutations and combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\n   With the advent of printing in the 15th century, spelling began to become<br/>\n   standardized. By the 19th century, most words had a single &quot;official&quot;<br/>\n   spelling, as a consensus, not by the diktat of a committee.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Today if you write &quot;definately&quot; and someone points out that you&#39;ve misspelled<br/>\n   the word, just tell them you&#39;re a practitioner of heterography.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Anu Garg (gargATwordsmith.org)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;A lengthy discourse on several levels of Arabic heterography leads,<br/>\n   however, to an assertion that the manuscript&#39;s African-Arabic script<br/>\n   is ... the opposite of a self-conscious European autobiography or<br/>\n   slave narrative.&quot;<br/>\n   Allan D.
