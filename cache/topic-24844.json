And what if this <br/>\nchild wants a more directed education? Here is an imaginary example..... a 14 <br/>\nyr. old unschooled boy decides that he wants to be a doctor. He is very <br/>\nmotivated and sincere. His parents totally support their son and have helped <br/>\nout by paying for some items he wanted and helping find information he wanted <br/>\nat the library and on the net. But the son wants a more traditional approach <br/>\nto education so that he will be ready for college. He even wants tests so <br/>\nthat he will know how to take them. He dreams of being the best in his class. <br/>\nHe dreams of healing the sick. If this was your family how would you approach <br/>\nthis situation and still be an unschooled family. <br/>\n <br/>\nThis is not my son (as he wants to be the 2nd Tony Hawke) but I am just <br/>\ncurious and want to better understand the unschooling philosophy.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nCandace</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25066,"nextTopicId":24905}}
