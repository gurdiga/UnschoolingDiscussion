BrickFest will be August 13-15 in <br/>\nWashington DC. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve got some more great prizes for this contest, with another copy <br/>\nStop Motion Pro animation software being graciously provided by the <br/>\nfolks over at Stop Motion Pro. The Sisters are also giving away <br/>\nanother camera. Scroll down for more details.<br/>\nThe theme of this contest will be High Adventure Theatre . This is <br/>\nnot as specific as it might seem. The only requirement is that a <br/>\ncharacter or characters must partake in some sort of adventure in <br/>\nyour film. After that, it&#39;s totally up to your imagination. Any <br/>\ngenre is fair game, whether it be space, cliffhangers, cavemen, <br/>\nhitmen, airplanes, boatplanes, pirates, gangsters, or brickfilm <br/>\nnoir. <br/>\nThere will be two sections of the competition, the on-line portion <br/>\nand the BrickFest portion. Each will have its own set of prizes and <br/>\nsystem of judging. The same films will be in both sections, you need <br/>\nnot submit separate films. <br/>\nThe films will be compiled onto an official Brickfilms/BrickFest DVD <br/>\nwhich will be sold at the festival and afterwards from the <br/>\nBrickfilms website. The price will be relatively low, with the aim <br/>\nof recovering the costs of production and contest prizes. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Amie&quot; &lt;amiersa2@c...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it was on this list that someone mentioned a program that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>helps kids<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; make the freeze frame type movie.
