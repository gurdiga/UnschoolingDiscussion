We ended up buying a Game Cube in the post-Christmas  <br/>\nglut of old video game systems on eBay. Eric&#39;s skill with the  <br/>\ncontroller improved immensely in one morning with his Daddy and a kid- <br/>\nappropriate game. Now he&#39;s really into Animal Crossing and plays  <br/>\nseveral sessions a day. I think it&#39;s great because:<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s wanting to be a homebody lately and this is one more option for  <br/>\nthe days we&#39;re spending at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe and his dad are having sweet times together. My partner is so  <br/>\npatient with Eric when he just wants to wander around digging holes,  <br/>\nor go in and out of his house, or try on all  his outfits one after  <br/>\nanother. I need to work on gaining more patience with this kind of  <br/>\nstuff myself. But we&#39;ve all been enjoying our time together playing  <br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also using the game to gain all kinds of skills, including:<br/>\n<br/>\nmap reading<br/>\n<br/>\nreading (already he can recognize some of the repetitive words and  <br/>\nphrases that show up in the dialogues. We read the rest to him.)<br/>\n<br/>\nproblem-solving<br/>\n<br/>\nmaking plans and strategizing (the other day he said to me as I was  <br/>\nplaying, &quot;If you go over the bridge instead, you can drop the comic  <br/>\nbook off at Candi&#39;s on your way to Doc&#39;s,&quot; or some such)<br/>\n<br/>\nfinances (he&#39;s got a mortgage to pay off on his little house!)<br/>\n<br/>\nnumber recognition; dealing with different magnitudes of numbers (in  <br/>\nthe hundreds and thousands)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conventions of video games<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has also brought from the game into the real world:<br/>\n<br/>\nA complex game with his little brother of delivering things to  <br/>\nimaginary friends all over the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWanting to write and receive notes (characters in the game write  <br/>\nletters to each other)<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interest in going to a real museum like the one in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I can tell, it&#39;s all good.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re not blinded--you&#39;ve managed to let go of ideas that aren&#39;t  <br/>\nuseful for you. You can see what is right in front of you--that your  <br/>\nkids are having a great time and doing great.
