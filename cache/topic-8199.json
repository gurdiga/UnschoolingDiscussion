It&#39;s unbelievable to me how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many of my cohorts - many of them past 40 yr.- who are still holding out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for another baby.  (I&#39;m not yet there but give me a moment...)  I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of us are just &quot;baby machines&quot; and it&#39;s what makes us happiest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Even as a child I used to love everyone else&#39;s babies.  Being only 7 or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 8 myself I&#39;d ring the neighbours&#39; doorbells asking if I could take their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; babies on walks.  And I&#39;d just want to sit and cuddle those babies and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very young children.  It was such fun!  I&#39;ve travelled, have almost 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; degrees, have various talents/abilities/social connections and have had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all kinds of &quot;worldly experiences&quot;, yet babies are still my number one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interest.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; BTW, I&#39;m Sonia Ulan (my maiden name)...S.Ulan...SULAN!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think Sulan must be a real name on it&#39;s own as I&#39;ve tried using it as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a password or user name on some sites and get refused that it&#39;s already<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taken.  Our family has traced back our family tree to Gengis Khan, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other &quot;royal ties&quot; to Mongolia.  (Capital city:  Ulan-Bator)  For<br/>\n&gt; &gt; centuries though, our ancestry has been of Ukrainian descent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; You didn&#39;t ask for all that but I thought I&#39;d pass on some history.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (Turns out Princess Diana was a descendent of Gengis Khan too!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sonia<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bctswim@...\">bctswim@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sonia,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I always think of you as being named sulan b/c of your e-mail.!
