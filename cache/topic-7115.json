I have met mothers<br/>\n&gt; of big babies who said their children were &quot;too&quot; big and must need<br/>\n&gt; solids. I&#39;ve met mothers of small babies who said their babies were<br/>\n&gt; &quot;too&quot; small and must need solids. Then the mothers of medium babies<br/>\n&gt; start them on solids because everyone else is, so it must be necessary,<br/>\n&gt; lol! Seriously, if your child is thriving, healthy, meeting milestones,<br/>\n&gt; bright and active and gaining weight then she is fine. I would not start<br/>\n&gt; a child on solids this early simply because they are big and they watch<br/>\n&gt; you eat. But this is totally your decision! That&#39;s just my fanatical<br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding mom opinion :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Like, I&#39;ve heard (T or F?)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that a one year old needs different nutrients than a newborn, so I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wondreing if that&#39;s because of size. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean? Your breastmilk at one year post partum has<br/>\n&gt; less fat in it (not NO fat, just LESS fat then in the beginning). Some<br/>\n&gt; solid and formula pushers will tell you that this is because it is<br/>\n&gt; inferior and you should supplement, but really it&#39;s because a one year<br/>\n&gt; old does not need to grow as quickly as a newborn and nature knows what<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s doing. But otherwise, breastmilk has the same vitamins and minerals<br/>\n&gt; it always did (and antibodies). It does not change due to the size of<br/>\n&gt; the baby, but due to the length of time post partum. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here are some LLL links if you are interested.

If you start your child early there may indeed be no<br/>\n&gt; repercussions. But you won&#39;t know that until you do. And many food<br/>\n&gt; allergies do not get diagnosed as such. Often moms start the young baby<br/>\n&gt; on solids and then do not connect this to certain problems that crop up<br/>\n&gt; (fussiness, asthma, etc.). However, there are many babies who start<br/>\n&gt; solids as early as a few weeks old with no side effects! I would<br/>\n&gt; definitely NOT recommend this tho. But starting the child when she is<br/>\n&gt; truely ready is the best bet. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This one <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBMayJun99p86.html\">http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBMayJun99p86.html</a> talks about<br/>\n&gt; readiness for solids. Different children are ready for solids at<br/>\n&gt; different times so yes, your child may indeed be ready. Obviously, we<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t see her in action, but from what you&#39;ve written, it sounds to me<br/>\n&gt; like she is not ready (JMO of course!). You can always try if you really<br/>\n&gt; believe she is ready and if she spits it out, back off and stop giving<br/>\n&gt; her the solids.
