(if you really are uncomfortable w/her <br/>\ncurrent answer.)  like how you mentioned to her that people dont always <br/>\nunderstand, so how bout we use this answer when people ask (if you can find a <br/>\nsuitable answer.)  for eg., i have a friend who had named their school so <br/>\nthat when people at the grocery store asked what school they went to they <br/>\nwould just say, &quot;oak tree academy&quot; or whatever and the conversation would <br/>\nend.  rather than saying &quot;oh, we homeschool&quot; and be willing to go where that <br/>\ntakes you.<br/>\n<br/>\nit is a personal thing!  i would rather (most days) invite the homeschooling <br/>\nconversation, but i definitely could see that there is sometimes reason NOT <br/>\nto invite it.<br/>\n<br/>\ni would tend to want to follow up on a comment like &quot;i dont see how it works, <br/>\neither&quot; from my daughter!  just because it would make me feel better to <br/>\nconvince her that she does really know that she is learning and progressing <br/>\nbeautifully!  i would want her to have that confidence.  but maybe this isnt <br/>\nwhat she meant.  i can understand this bugging you, though.  did you just let <br/>\nit lie when she said that?<br/>\n<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7718,"nextTopicId":8118}}
