I find the cheapest paper possible and we <br/>\nhave stacks and stacks of it accessible and my children go wild with <br/>\nit sometimes but produce some wonderful drawings and paintings, <br/>\ntoo.  When I was in the hospital giving birth two years ago, my 4 <br/>\nyear-old was doing her thing, drawing a bit, throwing the paper down <br/>\nbecause she was not satisfied, and my mother was just shocked and <br/>\ninsisted Emily draw on both sides of the paper and fill the paper <br/>\nbefore she took another paper!  Needless to say, Emily burst into <br/>\ntears and would not be consoled.  I had a real hard time explaining <br/>\nto my mother that we never limited paper in our house!  (I grew up <br/>\ndrawing on brown paper sacks from the grocery store and newspapers <br/>\nwhen we ran out of the brown sacks!)<br/>\nMary, IA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41301,"nextTopicId":41305}}
