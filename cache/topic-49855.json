I made each of them a little<br/>\n  book with pictures of us waiting for them, their birth families, etc. and<br/>\n  the story of them coming to our home.  I read it to them from when they were<br/>\n  babies.  We have an open relationship with their birth families and try to<br/>\n  visit.  Some of the families have been more involved than others.  Adriane<br/>\n  just saw her birthmom and step-birthdad (at least thats what we call him) in<br/>\n  September when we were in Dallas for a stock show.  We went out to dinner<br/>\n  and the birthparents came out to the stock show.  Adriane spent several<br/>\n  hours hanging out with them while I was busy with the goats.  Adriane is<br/>\n  excited that her birthmom is expecting a baby in the Spring.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It was harder when the kids were smaller.  The hurt of not being able to<br/>\n  raise this child was still fresh and birthfamily visits often ended in<br/>\n  gentle tears, not tears of regret but tears of sadness and long, deep hugs.<br/>\n  The kids would pick up on the sadness but not understand.  When Adriane<br/>\n  turned 6, she asked her birthmom to her birthday party.  Kristy came and<br/>\n  spent the weekend with us, camping out in Adriane&#39;s room.  The tears stopped<br/>\n  after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Zach used to wonder why his birthfamily didn&#39;t keep him to raise, but later<br/>\n  had 2 boys that they did keep.  We talked a lot about differences in<br/>\n  circumstances and how babies can&#39;t always wait until we get it together.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Having been adopted has never seemed like a major issue around here, it is<br/>\n  talked about but not dwelt upon nor avoided.  I have a memory box for each<br/>\n  of the kids with stuff from their birthfamilies, as well as baptisms, etc..<br/>\n  The kids love getting out the boxes and hearing the stories about the first<br/>\n  time I saw them or ways they are like their birthparents.
