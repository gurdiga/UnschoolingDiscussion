I think lots<br/>\n  of 11 year olds have trouble expressing their feelings.  It sucks that you<br/>\n  landed in Stickuptheirbutts USA.**<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have to agree with Rue,  Shyrley.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I saw you with your kids, both at the conference and at your home.  You are not a crappy mother.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  It does take time for all of us to learn how to live peacefully.  Especially when we weren&#39;t raised that way.   On bad days I tell myself, &quot;one day at a time&quot;.   Then we talk and talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You are doing a good job, but its hard to realize that in &quot;Stickuptheirbutts USA&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  **Ever since the conference we&#39;ve all been feeling more<br/>\n  lonely, because we know you all are out there.**<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ah,  yes,  its the same here  :(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38060,"nextTopicId":80383}}
