My in laws use to tell me what I should and shouldn&#39;t do all the <br/>\ntime. It&#39;s a major sore spot with me. I don&#39;t see them anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo right off the bat, the mom who said I should make my kids clean up would <br/>\nhear from me. I would try and be nice. It doesn&#39;t always work. I can <br/>\nhonestly say that whenever my kids have gone to anyone else&#39;s house, they <br/>\nnever have made a major mess. I have pitched in and started to pick up a few <br/>\nstragglers laying around, but the kids are usually pretty good about picking <br/>\nup. Then to, the homes they have been in are relatively neat and they follow <br/>\nsuit of the family that lives there. Most times the mom will say to leave <br/>\nthe stuff as there isn&#39;t much anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children come here, which is more often than the other way around, my <br/>\nkids know they can have house rules as to how they want their things played <br/>\nwith. Not how to play exactly but how to handle things. It&#39;s their <br/>\nbelongings and they are entitled to not share if they don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike when parents make their children share everything they have. My kids <br/>\nwant kids to have fun and come over, so they naturally want them to play <br/>\nwith stuff. If there are a few things they are hesitent about, we put them <br/>\naway before the other children come over. If a child was doing something to <br/>\none of my chldrens toys that made them uncomfortable, I would have no <br/>\nproblem saying that so and so doesn&#39;t like when someone does that. Never had <br/>\nit happen though. But when they were younger, we did put things away ahead <br/>\nof time. Now the children don&#39;t mind. Of course their friends are respectful <br/>\nof their things too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far my children and those visiting have played equally with the toys. <br/>\nWhen they are finished, my kids start to clean up and usually the other <br/>\nchild will too. Sometimes the other mom will mention for the child to help <br/>\nclean up. If it seems overwhelming and they want to move on to other things, <br/>\nI will step in and take over. So far it&#39;s never been a major deal. If a <br/>\nchild came here and randomly took things apart without even being involved <br/>\nwith my children, I would step in and say something to the child. In a very <br/>\nnice here&#39;s what we do here kind of way. So far I haven&#39;t run into any <br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

If the mom or whoever says &quot;just leave<br/>\nit - you guys don&#39;t need to clean this up&quot; then that&#39;s another matter. But<br/>\nwe always offer to clean up what the kids have all played with - and I will<br/>\nget right in there (especially when they were younger) and help clean up,<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as for what to do if the adult in charge at your house just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a clue of offering to help clean up (or keep toys in order, as you<br/>\npointed out was another problem).<br/>\nI would have no problem in voicing my concerns next time they come over<br/>\n*before* the play session begins. I would say something like &quot;if you are all<br/>\ngoing to play with those toys, then you all must agree to help clean them up<br/>\nwhen you are done.&quot; I would include my kids in on &quot;the one&#39;s who will help<br/>\nclean up&quot;, just so that it is everyone cleaning up together and so noone is<br/>\nbeing singled out. I would also say all this in front of the mom (or adult<br/>\nin charge) to let them know that this has been a problem in the past and<br/>\nhopefully she will be sensitive to helping out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf none of this works and kids coming over still make and leave a mess and<br/>\ndisregard you and your children&#39;s feelings, I wouldn&#39;t invite them over<br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88778760,"authorName":"Debi Watson","from":"Debi Watson &lt;debiwatson@...&gt;","profile":"sheplusthree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: clean up","postDate":"1046823788","msgId":60065,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWMyZTJhZCQ2NWUzMjYwMCQxYWE0NTYxOEBlZC5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMyZTJhMSQ5MWM5MGU4MCQ3NjNlNjA0NEBrZXZpbnR1Y2tlcj4gPDAwYWUwMWMyZTJhNCQxODg2ZGE0MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60066,"prevInTime":60064,"nextInTime":60066,"topicId":60065,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have come a long way from where I was last spring when I first joined, but I am having lots of trouble with this one.

I am *not* stamping my feet and<br/>\nsaying that you all are wrong: I am saying that I need help seeing it the<br/>\nway you do.<br/>\n    While I don&#39;t consciously expect my adult company to help tidy up after<br/>\ndinner or tea or whatever, I really appreciate the company and the help and<br/>\nit&#39;s a time to chat more with your hands in warm dishwater or leaning<br/>\nagainst the counter or whatever.  It&#39;s a comfortable time.  And we have<br/>\nfound that with our abundant supply of &quot;strew-ables&quot; that many kids will<br/>\nsimply pick them up, dissemble them, and move on like mini tornadoes,<br/>\nleaving wreckage and mayhem in their path. For example, the kids have a<br/>\nlarge bin of Playmobil that they play exclusively Lord of the Rings with,<br/>\nand another bin of just assorted Playmobil.  We have kids come over who dump<br/>\nout both sets on the floor, pull all the hair off the characters, tear off<br/>\ntheir costumes, and then leave them mixed in a heap.  My kids hate sorting<br/>\nout that kind of a mess, and so do I.  They have them sorted the way they<br/>\nwant them, and want to act things out with them -- not waste hours finding<br/>\nthe right hair for the characters and all their little props.  Why should<br/>\nthe visiting kids not be expected to leave things the way they were when<br/>\nthey are finished?  My kids do when they are out -- I help them, and we<br/>\nnever leave a disaster for our hosts.  That&#39;s just being a good guest.  If<br/>\nmy friends came to my house and pulled out all my clean laundry from my<br/>\ndrawers and mixed them with the towels and dishes, and then left me with the<br/>\nresulting heap, *I* would be a trifle resentful.  The attitude here is, if<br/>\nit is important to you that the characters be put back ready for another<br/>\ninstallment, then put them in the box.  If you *don&#39;t* care, shove them<br/>\nwherever, except in the oven because then they melt when I am pre-heating.<br/>\nI think that if my friends&#39; kids consistently made a huge mess for me and<br/>\n*my* kids, we would either only visit there, or meet some place neutral.<br/>\nWhat am I missing here?
