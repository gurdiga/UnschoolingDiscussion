So she&#39;s learned a lot about what school looks like from <br/>\nthe outside. When she occasionally decided to put herself on a &quot;school <br/>\nschedule&quot;, something resembling SSR was usually included, and was often the <br/>\nreason she decided to drop her schedule - because she started to hate picking <br/>\nup a good book knowing she was going to have to put it down again in half an <br/>\nhour and go on to something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years too she took notice of the attitudes her friends developed <br/>\ntoward books and reading. At 16 she recommended a novel to a friend, to be <br/>\ntold &quot;I don&#39;t have to read that, so I won&#39;t&quot;. At 17 another friend, a <br/>\nNational Honor Society member, asked her to go to the library to help pick <br/>\nout a book. The friend said she hadn&#39;t read anything all summer and so wanted <br/>\nto assign herself something to get back into reading. When asked what authors <br/>\nshe&#39;d enjoyed before, what types of stories she might like, her friend <br/>\nreplied &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. Just make sure it&#39;s at least 700 pages.&quot; Melissa <br/>\nwas absolutely astonished that anyone would pick a book by weight. These were <br/>\njust a few of the most memorable examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nSSR isn&#39;t a particularly new concept. It was popular in my oldest son&#39;s <br/>\nschools in the 80&#39;s. At least there the teachers really did work at making <br/>\nsure the kids had things to read of their own choice, without restrictions. <br/>\nThey could bring in magazines, comics, books, whatever they wanted, as long <br/>\nas they had something to read. And everybody read. When the bell went off, <br/>\nevery single person in the school picked up something and sat down to read <br/>\nit. The principal read, the janitors read, the teachers read. It wasn&#39;t just <br/>\nsomething being done to the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"required reading","postDate":"1046317994","msgId":59701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4ZS4xNmM3NjNhOS4yYjhlZTVhYUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59706,"prevInTime":59700,"nextInTime":59702,"topicId":59701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/26/03 3:51:43 PM Central Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-259082565\">In a message dated 2/26/03 3:51:43 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   (And now I<br/>\n finally remember that Florida is the sunshine state  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reminding me...it&#39;s raining cats and dogs right now.
