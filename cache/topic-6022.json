Your experience sounds similar to mine in some ways.  I was in<br/>\nthe GATE program from 3rd grade on, but always got reports that said I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t do assignments, didn&#39;t finish work, that kind of thing.  I frankly,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t care.  I was so disillusioned and disgusted with the IS&#39;s offerings<br/>\nand their entire system, that I was already unschooling myself as much as<br/>\npossible as early as I could.  I had access to great museums, libraries,<br/>\nand cultural things in the city, as well as learning opportunites presented<br/>\nby peers and other factors.  I got failing grades in most things and often<br/>\nended up in summer school (which was a waste of time and rediculously easy<br/>\nwork, not to mention getting beat up every summer!)  but I really did not<br/>\ncare a whit about any of it.  If it were not for the terrible blows my self<br/>\nesteem were taking in the IS system, I might have largely ignored it<br/>\nalltogether.  I ALWAYS, from day one, hated, HATED school.  I used to hide<br/>\nunder my bed when I was little or feign illness to avoid going.  When I got<br/>\nolder, I just began to cut school as often as possible.  My parents never<br/>\ndid anythig to try and improve my schooling, change my evnironment,<br/>\ninterest me in school, etc.  They just trusted the system to &quot;educate&quot; me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Beth Burnham","from":"&quot;Beth Burnham&quot; &lt;beth2002@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UB5_9HClkngdxRfdOU6IQG_zVV4hAcElwKl14fVDCcmk6P12c_mIk6NaLKfQJDT5KiXSwqNfgoxnTrw4C3vCVO5kN3GfzoUD5A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: report card","postDate":"949378409","msgId":6025,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOTQuNjAyNS45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6022,"nextInTopic":6051,"prevInTime":6024,"nextInTime":6026,"topicId":6022,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Heather glad you survived the ps to live to tell about it here!
