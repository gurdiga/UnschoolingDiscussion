I have found my own<br/>\nlife changing in a similar way since unschooling.  I am learning to be<br/>\nrespectful of myself and others without being either controlling or<br/>\npassive.  <br/>\nI noticed your opinions caused a lot of sparks, but very interesting<br/>\nones.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32368,"nextTopicId":32398}}
