Every once in a while we forget that no one else can replace our efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n I got a magazine in the mail the other day (a promotional copy), glanced through it and threw it away.  Every woman in there appeared so self absorbed and pathetic.  Most of them fit the working mom stereotype and appeared to &quot;have it all&quot;.  To me the pictures and articles were shallow and repulsive, but I know a few years ago I would have thought it was a glamorous, even enviable lifestyle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSociety tells us that we&#39;re successful if we have a great job, send our kids to the best schools, exercise ourselves skinny, take classes at night and fake everything we possibly can about our looks.  If you can manage this (which only takes about 20 hours a day), then you&#39;ve made it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad that I am not chained to those ideas anymore.  I think it&#39;s so cool that I am getting to know people like you who enjoy being REAL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess on those days when I think it would be great to have a paycheck again I&#39;ll just remember that my number one job is raising REAL kids.

I agree that finances are extremely<br/>\nimportant, but earning the salary is not the only way to contribute<br/>\nfinancially to your family.  Consider the skill and care you invest in<br/>\nmanaging your money -- creating a budget, paying bills on time, managing<br/>\nyour savings, and purchasing the necessities and the occasional luxuries.<br/>\n When the paycheck is deposited in the bank, the work doesn&#39;t end, it is<br/>\njust beginning!  No matter how much the wage earner brings in, if the<br/>\nspouse at home isn&#39;t working with him/her to manage it well, the finances<br/>\nwill be in shambles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember an interview with Barbara Bush inwhich she prefaced an answer<br/>\nwith, &quot;when we were vice president.&quot;  I was single at the time and my<br/>\nfriends and I had a good laugh over that part of her response,  but now<br/>\nthat I am married I understand where she&#39;s coming from.  True, DHs<br/>\npaycheck is made out to him alone, but I know that it is for me and my<br/>\nchildren too.  Marriage is a union, and whatever is done is done for the<br/>\nbenefit of that union.    <br/>\n<br/>\nCourtney in AZ, USA<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:---Cubessence@...\">---Cubessence@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTHE RULES HAVE CHANGED!

We took our son out of ps about a year and a half ago, did &quot;school at home&quot; until last week, when we realized our son was equally as miserable, and that we needed to change.  So....we just let him go.  He&#39;s still in shock, I think.  So are we.  He spends all day on the computer playing games, and I am trying very hard to re-work my thinking each and every hour.  It&#39;s so scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s a bit of our schooling history, but your comment above really caught my eye.  I, too, have been in the exact same position for most of my married life.  I did work and put my dh through med school, then had a baby and quit to raise them. The dependence issue seems to be coming up more and more as my boys need me less and less.  What am I contributing compared to dh?  What I&#39;ve realized this past year is that I&#39;ve unconsciously created a life for myself where I &quot;get to feel guilty&quot; whichever way I seem to turn.  If I spend &quot;his&quot; money, if I&#39;m not here at home with the kids every minute, if I don&#39;t have nicely kept home, if I enjoy myself too much.....blah, blah, blah.  I&#39;m working deeply on seeing my own self denial.....or better said.....denial of self.  It&#39;s all been about what others need and want that seems to make me whole.  Caring for &quot;just me&quot; at a deep level seems somehow selfish.  Should that be?<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go into a whole religious thing here....afterall, most religions are really pushing the denial of self.  Here&#39;s the way most go.......first God, then everyone else, then self.  My point isn&#39;t about religion, though.....it&#39;s about how most of us are raised to put ourselves last for everything.....especially us moms. I&#39;m trying very hard to stop and ask myself what would make ME happy these days.  Guess what I&#39;m finding my answer is?  Making &quot;the other person&quot; happy (the kids, hubby friends, strangers!).  This has been quite illuminating for me, to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is, guilt is really a poisonous thing.  It may get us to do tons of things for everyone, but it rarely allows us to care for ourselves.  My husband is deeply into alternative medicine and therapies, and we often discuss dis-ease......meaning &quot;not at ease with ourselves&quot;.  We think guilt is a major producer of certain illnesses.  Who needs it?  Apparently, a good many of us, unfortunately. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest reasons we decided to just let go of the whole schooling thing is because we could see the stress it was putting on our son, and even more on the ps kids.  They&#39;re all pushing and struggling and killing themselves for the right grades for the right college.....and at what cost?  They&#39;re all losing themselves.  We didn&#39;t want our boys to lose themselves in some schooling process.  My husband likes to say......&quot;Where are we all going?&quot;.....meaning, &quot;What are all these kids struggling TO?&quot;  Certainly not peace and contentment.  What we see is that more and more, the kids are struggling mercilessly to six figures!  <br/>\n<br/>\nGolly, I&#39;ve run on way too long.  I just wanted to respond to your dependence thought and I got carried away.  Nice to find this list.  Thanks for listening.

Here&#39;s the lineup:<br/>\n  1.  I put God first in my life, because he&#39;s where my strength comes from.  If I keep my relationship with him fresh everyday (through prayer or meditation,  Bible reading and/or music), then I am constantly renewed.<br/>\n  2.  I am married, so my marriage comes next, but not to deny myself (I am half of the marriage) or the children.  <br/>\n  3.  My children are my next priority and all the things that my life has to offer fall in after these 3 main things.<br/>\n  Now, I can honestly say that I don&#39;t do these in this order every day, but when I do, things run a lot smoother.  If my relationship with God is current, then I can be effective in my marriage.  If my marriage is strong, then I can take the best care of my kids.  When all those things are satisfied, then, I can be available and useful to everyone else.<br/>\n  Did you see where I fit in?  Right at the top in my relationship with God.  Not that I put myself on the same level with him by any means, but I have to take care of myself before I can take care of anyone else and that&#39;s not self denial.<br/>\n  I know there are religions out there, or more aptly people, who enjoy denying themselves, but I think a lot of them enjoy being martyrs.(I know a few personally)  They aren&#39;t doing anyone any good though.  God certainly can&#39;t use someone who denies themself just for the sake of being a martyr.  <br/>\n  I also loved how you said that making the other person happy, makes you happy.  You&#39;re right - it&#39;s not denial of self - it&#39;s focusing on others.  When we think of others we don&#39;t even have time to concentrate on those little daily bothers.<br/>\n  Now I&#39;ve rambled on, but I guess this struck a chord with me because I have probably been feeling kind of like a martyr myself lately.  I told David:  &quot;Since we&#39;ve been homeschooling I feel like I do for everyone and I don&#39;t have anything for myself - Oh and I went on and on - you may have had these little closed door meetings too.  He went to the store and bought me a candle - he&#39;s really trying :)  Anyway, I decided yesterday that I wasn&#39;t going to let everyone else&#39;s mood determine my mood and what kind of day I have.<br/>\n  Does any of this make sense?

He does have strong feelings about such things, even clothes, I am often wary of buying stuff for the kids if I think he won&#39;t like it (there&#39;s no point spending money on stuff he wouldn&#39;t want them to wear, what a snob!!!)  Recently I have felt more restricted by this, but since I don&#39;t want my children to go to school, or spend any more time away from me than they already do, I can&#39;t go out and earn a living, or take time away from them at home (although I do have a couple of little projects, anyone here write for a living???) so I&#39;m deaing with it as I go.  Even though I hate the car I drive most, it&#39;s my mother&#39;s and is currently residing on the drive, broken again!!!  If I want a new one, I&#39;d have to earn the pennies for it, so it&#39;ll have to wait!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what I&#39;m trying to say is that even though I&#39;ve never independently financed my life, I still feel restriced by being dependent on another.
