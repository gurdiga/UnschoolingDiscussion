Nobody has told me that I can&#39;t bring<br/>\nthem in.  ONe year, a voting officient even offered a stool to my ds<br/>\nso he could see what I was doing!

(in the 1970&#39;s)   My parents<br/>\ntook us with them into the voting booth.  Voting was an important part<br/>\nof the adult world, so I felt really important being in there with<br/>\nthem, and very curious, too.  (I really remember feeling this way.)  I<br/>\nthink  I went with them till I was about 10 or so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI find it very sad that kids are being kept out of voting places.  I<br/>\nthink this restriction does us a disserviice, as generating interest<br/>\nin voting when kids are curious about it will increase the number of<br/>\nvoting adults later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the common argument for not allowing kids in with their<br/>\nparents is that they are disruptive.  But I tell ya, <br/>\nwhen I go to vote, the man who comes in and jaws with the officient<br/>\nwhile waiting his turn (booming, &quot;Howdy , Fred!

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2051393832\">I&#39;m not a big follower of the California Recall going on right now, but I was <br/>\nreading a teaser on AOL&#39;s welcome page and clicked to read the whole article. <br/>\nThis one small paragraph stood out and as it represents part of a strong <br/>\nopinion I have I thought I would pass it on. FWIW<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Thousand Oaks, McClintock voted and urged citizens to &quot;simply vote your <br/>\nconscience... If everybody who believes I am the best qualified votes for me, we <br/>\nwill have an upset tonight.&quot; Things had begun quietly at that polling place, <br/>\nbut soon people began arriving in large numbers, some with children in tow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat last line; *some with children in tow.* got me. I am one of those who <br/>\nstill want to believe that every vote counts and I take my kids everywhere, even <br/>\nwhen I vote. I want them to see what I do, I like to explain my choices and <br/>\nlike it when they ask about the process. Every time though, I am told that <br/>\nchildren are not allowed in the voting areas, but I take them anyway. I think it <br/>\nis important. I wonder by that statement in the article if children in the <br/>\nvoting area is frowned upon in other areas as well? Do any of you take your kids <br/>\nwith?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople always call it luck when you&#39;ve acted more sensibly than they have. <br/>\nAnne Tyler <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82102,"nextTopicId":82558}}
