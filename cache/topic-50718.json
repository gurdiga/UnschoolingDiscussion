That isn&#39;t necessary, but in our case things had gone too far.<br/>\nDon&#39;t wait.<br/>\nIt&#39;s so very difficult to see any hope when you&#39;re on that side of things, <br/>\nbut it really is possible to completely change the entire relationship.<br/>\nDh and I are truly best friends now, I never thought we could have the <br/>\nrelationship we do now.  Bickering and anger were so common before we split <br/>\nup.<br/>\nWe hardly EVER have disagreements now. And if we do, we know how to talk and <br/>\ncome to solutions.<br/>\nA huge part of the healing was learning to accept the other person just the <br/>\nway they are. Sounds so simple, but it was huge for us. I think we spent <br/>\nyears trying to  change each other. Crazy.<br/>\nAnyway, counseling can be a wonderful catalyst for change. It&#39;s a safe ground <br/>\nto vent, to analyze and to figure out where to go. I hope you don&#39;t just <br/>\naccept the relationship the way it is today, but realize that this could be a <br/>\nchance for huge change and be willing to take on the struggle and work it <br/>\ntakes to take a few steps in that direction.
