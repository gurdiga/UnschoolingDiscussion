I picture it more as a<br/>\nconversation at the start at least, with more and more of the conversation<br/>\ngiven over to the child until the time they could write an essay about the<br/>\ntopic. (The end goal was writing an essay.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, in effect, at least from my understanding, if you read a book to your<br/>\nchild an asked what they thought and then added some of your own questions<br/>\nand understandings, you would be having your child narrate.  If your child<br/>\nbounced in the room excitedly telling you about the birds in the nest and<br/>\nthat they were born, and they are so funny looking, that would be narration.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI think most of us do this to some extent, it seemed to me she was<br/>\nencouraging it as more normative practice.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, March 11, 2003 18:01:30\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Charlotte Mason\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI also think part of the purpose for narration was to help you remember what\r<br/>\nyou read.
