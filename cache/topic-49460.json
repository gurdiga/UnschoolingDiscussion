We have a tv and vcr in <br/>\neach bedroom, a big tv w/ vcr and dvd in the living room, a little tv <br/>\n(for the car - we recently did a 1500 mile trip, each way.. got the tv <br/>\nfor the ride home) with built in vcr which is now in the family room for <br/>\nwatching tapes, and hubby has another one in his office. But the kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t watch tv all day long, and we tape all of the shows we watch. We <br/>\nsometimes won&#39;t actually watch a show until months after it aired. We <br/>\nhave homeschooling friends who greatly restrict tv watching, and if the <br/>\ntv is on when these kids come over, they don&#39;t want to do anything else, <br/>\nwhereas my kids see the tv as one more option but it isn&#39;t a magnet for <br/>\nthem. The girls will often get in discussions about whether  a show is <br/>\nworthwhile or not and why, and have sometimes decided to stop watching a <br/>\nshow because of one of these discussions. They&#39;re more likely to be up <br/>\nlate reading than watching tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was harder for me to let go of the food thing, but I am doing my <br/>\nbest. When they come ask if they can have something, I tell them they <br/>\nknow about healthy eating, decide for themselves. Hubby likes to check <br/>\nup on their eating, so this may take a while, but he does leave them <br/>\nalone once he sees that they are doing stuff on their own. He comes from <br/>\na very controlling family, so it&#39;s a little tough for him to let go <br/>\nsometimes, but he is great with the kids, and since nearly everytime he <br/>\nasks them &quot;did you have fruit today&quot; or something like that, and the <br/>\nanswer is always &quot;yes&quot;, he doesn&#39;t ask nearly as often. (who&#39;s teaching <br/>\nwho? :-)  My kids are always amazed when they go over a friend&#39;s house <br/>\nand people don&#39;t have any fresh fruit in the house. If we don&#39;t have at <br/>\nleast three or four different kinds, it&#39;s time to go shopping.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I&#39;m rambling. When I step back and watch, and stay out of the way, <br/>\nI&#39;m always, always amazed at how much kids really do &quot;get it&quot; and how <br/>\noften adults (not just parents) can get in the way of what they want to <br/>\nlearn, do, accomplish.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Friday, November 8, 2002, at 11:27  PM, Stephanie Elms wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Color TVs are REALLY cheap these days, and VCRs too!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yeah...I have been thinking about this lately.

The interesting thing is that <br/>\nI have some wonderful attachment parenting friends who think that I am a little <br/>\nnuts for letting go of the restrictions that I have. I had an interesting <br/>\ndiscussion on an ap email list I have been on for over 3 years...basically the<br/>\nmajority of the AP moms there felt that trusting your child to know how often<br/>\nto nurse or when to move into their own bed was different then trusting them<br/>\nto know what to eat (not that they advocated forcing kids to eat, but rather<br/>\njust limit access to junk food) or how much tv to watch. They considered one <br/>\ndevelopmental and the latter more of a learned response. It seems to me that<br/>\nmany AP moms get more mainstream in their practices as their kids got older. <br/>\n*Much* more attached and sensitive to their child&#39;s point of view then most <br/>\nparents I know, but still feeling it necessary to control certain aspects of<br/>\ntheir children&#39;s lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-If Kyle was watching tv and Jason wanted to watch <br/>\n&gt; something, I used to <br/>\n&gt; say, well<br/>\n&gt; it is his turn you have to wait.

It seems like<br/>\nall our routines are up in the air and I am finding that I am having a harder time <br/>\nadjusting myself to then I thought I would. I have always been a very relaxed mom<br/>\nespecially when compared to my mom and to most of my friends and it is throwing me<br/>\nto really look at myself and seeing how much I really do control my kids. And now<br/>\nseeing their reactions (especially Jason&#39;s) as I try to change this is hard. Realizing<br/>\nthat they did feel controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see how giving up control will make things better all around. I honestly thought that <br/>\nI would have an easier time adjusting to this. The funny thing is that I have found <br/>\ngiving up the &quot;schooling&quot; mindset the easiest! Probably because we never really started<br/>\nschool. It is giving up the food controls and other controls that I implemented in their<br/>\nlives that seem to be the most difficult. I feel like right now the pendulum is over<br/>\ncorrecting and I am hoping that we will be able to get into balance soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of things that I read on unschooling.com that have definitely improved<br/>\nhow I interact with my kids...one is coming from an attitude of helping the boys get what<br/>\nthey need/want rather then being the one to stand in their way. I have been pleasantly<br/>\nsurprised how just this change in thought has helped me change the way that I deal with <br/>\nthings. If Kyle was watching tv and Jason wanted to watch something, I used to say, well<br/>\nit is his turn you have to wait. Now I say, let&#39;s go ask him. I try to help them talk it<br/>\nout a bit and if Kyle&#39;s answer is still no, I try to find something to do with Jason. Just<br/>\nthe fact that I tried seems to go a long way. And sometimes Kyle says yes! I have noticed<br/>\nthat they are both doing much better with sharing the tv even without me getting involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that I have been trying to do is to let Jason &quot;shine&quot; in my eyes. He really<br/>\nis such a wonderful little boy. I think the hardest thing for me to realize is that I tend <br/>\nto correct and criticize more then I used to think I did. It gets worse when I get tired<br/>\nor frustrated, so unfortunately now is not my best time...Kyle (2.5) is giving up his <br/>\nnaps which makes for a very cranky baby in the evening and all 4 of us are coming down <br/>\nwith colds which means that Kyle is up a lot at night. And since he decided that he had <br/>\nto sleep with his brother several months ago (instead of with us) that means that I get <br/>\nto haul my butt upstairs in the middle of the night to get him and bring him down with <br/>\nus. Then he is still up several times for the rest of the night. Which means that I am <br/>\nmore cranky then normal. Oh yeah and I am also PMSing...not a great combination. Any <br/>\nsuggestions for seeing the good in your 5 yo when he has just hit his brother right after  <br/>\nyou told him to stop it? I know that if I can get myself past the behavior and see him <br/>\nas the great kid he is it will help to stop the behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK. I guess that I just had to whine a little...and I am hoping that someone will say that<br/>\nyes it is normal for the mom to go through an adjustment period and that things will<br/>\nsettle down again. I just feel like I need to be so *on* for my kids especially now since<br/>\nI am really looking at the way that I interact with them. And it can be exhausting, especially<br/>\nwhen I am exhausted...it does get easier doesn&#39;t it? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to those of you who have been posting about wishing that they had a toddler again, keep <br/>\nthem coming! It really has helped remind me to put things in perspective. I know that this<br/>\nwill pass, but it sure helps to be reminded that I will miss this age...and I know that I <br/>\nwill, but it is still exhausting!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49612,"nextTopicId":49534}}
