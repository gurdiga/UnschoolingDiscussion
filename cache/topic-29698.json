Look for at least a year before he settles into<br/>\nmaturity instead of the 6 month range of some breeds.    Lots of chewing, a<br/>\nseeming lack of self control............maybe like what some might view as a<br/>\nhyperactive kid.     But it DOES get better.   Mature huskies are actually<br/>\npretty laid back (towards people at least.......they ARE predators and I doubt<br/>\nchickens are even sheep or goats would ever be completely safe without a<br/>\nbarrier).<br/>\nI find Huskies to actually be very good as &quot;inside&quot; dogs once grown.   They bond<br/>\nwith the &quot;alpha wolf&quot;  in the household and, as I said, as adults they spend<br/>\nLOTS of time just denning up  or being the equivalent of a wolfskin rug.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are incredibly strong as well as intelligent.  And patient if trying to<br/>\ndetermine a way out of unwanted confinement.   Best to make them WANT to be with<br/>\nyou or to WANT to stay in a fenced yard.<br/>\nOh yes...........they are generally not vicious dogs and their only usefulness<br/>\nas a &quot;guard dog&quot;  or &quot;watch dog&quot;  is visually!    Also, huskies don&#39;t generally<br/>\nbark.   They may howl  or sing (I have one who speaks a few words in English!)<br/>\nbut not the woof-woof or yapping one associates with other breeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a part Husky, particularly if Rottweiler is in the mix................I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nvicki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Dog training","postDate":"1007859632","msgId":29698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBHTzEwMEZLWVhHVzZBQG10YTYuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29702,"prevInTime":29697,"nextInTime":29699,"topicId":29698,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... 7 months is adolescence.

BK (Before Kids &lt;g&gt;) it was<br/>\n&gt; dog<br/>\n&gt;&gt; training.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perfect timing . . .<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a question for you.  My sil just dumped her 7 month old dog on<br/>\n&gt; us.  (Okay, we did agree.)  Anyway, she says he is part Lab and part<br/>\n&gt; Husky and I suspect part Rottweiler from his coloring.  They got him<br/>\n&gt; at 8 weeks or so and kept him in a cage most of the time.  Needless<br/>\n&gt; to say, he is a behavioural nightmare.  He is very strong and very<br/>\n&gt; exuberant.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question, will it be possible to get him calmed down and trained?<br/>\n&gt; My thought is that he is still pretty young and he is not mean just<br/>\n&gt; boisterous, so he is probably not a lost cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>7 months is adolescence. If he isn&#39;t neutered, that&#39;s the first thing (at<br/>\nhome with a pair of pliers if necessary. NO, just kidding. Mostly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he isn&#39;t biting people, there&#39;s hope (sometimes there&#39;s hope if they are<br/>\nbiting people, but frankly I wouldn&#39;t waste time with a biting dog in a<br/>\nhouse with kids and their friends when there are so many non-biting dogs<br/>\nkilled in shelters).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite training book is Good Owners, Great Dogs by Brian Kilcommons<br/>\n(available through Amazon.com and elsewhere). If you can find a dog training<br/>\nclass near you and keep taking him through 8-week courses until people are<br/>\nstopping you on the street to ask how you got your dog to behave so well,<br/>\nthat&#39;s good, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of it is owner training.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalm is relative. You can train him to be calm on command (stay commands,<br/>\nbed commands, etc.) but the rest is his personality. Young male dogs of<br/>\nworking breeds tend to have a lot of energy. He needs to get out and RUN<br/>\n(flat out run, not just a nice walk for a few miles) for an hour or so every<br/>\nday if you can manage it (fenced yard if he&#39;ll play hard chasing a ball or a<br/>\nlure on a stick, or doing consecutive low hurdles for treats, or a dog park,<br/>\netc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29457,"nextTopicId":29732}}
