My two girls often come and say they are bored. It usually  <br/>\nresults in them sitting on my lap for a one on one chat about  <br/>\nsomething then by us tickling each other relentlessly and having fun  <br/>\nlaughing together. Then after a while they usually skip off saying  <br/>\nthey had remembered about something they wanted to do earlier and  <br/>\noff  they go to another part of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes worry about my children in that I may not be providing  <br/>\nthem with enough of myself if my energy tanks are low and I am  <br/>\nexhausted some evenings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Sandra, your article made me not feel like I am doing anything  <br/>\nnegative and strengthened my belief in what I am doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen J.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108786,"nextTopicId":108962}}
