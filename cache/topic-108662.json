I don&#39;t know where it originally was, but pobably <br/>\nat unschooling.com (for having my whole name):<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Sandra Lynn Dodd (Sandradodd) on Friday, January 18, 2002 - 12:24 pm:<br/>\n<br/>\n[quoting someone, doesn&#39;t matter who, I don&#39;t remember]<br/>\n-=-My fear (well one of them) is the example of a <br/>\nclose friend of mine. She unschooled all four of <br/>\nher kids although the oldest girl did go to p.s. <br/>\nstarting in 8th grade through 12. But, out of all <br/>\nfour of her kids, three are depressed, no job, or <br/>\na low paying job, and the 20 yr old is pregnant by <br/>\na deadbeat who is on drugs, sleeping around with a <br/>\n17 year old, already fathered another child <br/>\npreviously, etc, etc. -=- <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s better, still, than if they had gone <br/>\nto school! (I&#39;m serious. It sounds stupid, but <br/>\nsome kids at school get dead, or in trouble with <br/>\nthe law, and school is certainly no charm against <br/>\npregnancy, and by 20 school wouldn&#39;t have been a <br/>\nfactor. Fourteen year olds get pregnant from kids <br/>\nthey meet at school. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My friend was/is the most layed back mom <br/>\naround. Never (I mean never) hit her kids, <br/>\nattachment parenting, extended breastfeeding, <br/>\nfamily bed, very few rules . . . and they are <br/>\ndepressed kids. So, that&#39;s my fear. -=- <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that lists what she didn&#39;t do (hit, make a <br/>\nbunch of rules) but what DID she do to make their <br/>\nlives richer and full of ideas and exposure to <br/>\neverything in the whole wide world? Maybe the <br/>\nmom&#39;s depressed too. Maybe it&#39;s genetic. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow, but if you want unschooling to work just <br/>\nbecause you stick the curriculum under the couch, <br/>\nit won&#39;t! Get the world swirling around you <br/>\n(first) and your children (second) so there are <br/>\nsounds, sights, smells, tastes and textures for <br/>\nthem to process and build their internal model of <br/>\nthe universe from. GET MOVING, mentally and <br/>\nphysically. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra <br/>\n====================================<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it seemed someone was blaming unschooling for depressing, and for <br/>\npregnancy (but in a 20 year old!)    When kids are in school, is school often blamed <br/>\nfor depression or pregnancy?   I don&#39;t think so.   Parents are blamed.   LACK <br/>\nof attention to school is blamed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s interesting and worth a look.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108589,"nextTopicId":108672}}
