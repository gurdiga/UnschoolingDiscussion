I did NOT go back in the fall, because I started doing something else that summer and it was of much more interest to me.  I did go back to college many years later.

I was getting ready to pass this link <br/>\non to my mom, who is pressuring us (esp. my 15 year old) to get her <br/>\ninto algebra NOW, so she can get into college. Thinking &quot;Okay, this <br/>\nwould answer a lot of her questions&quot;...and then came to the one about <br/>\nalgebra. From there on, it&#39;s ME!<br/>\n<br/>\nI still might do it. &quot;Here, mom. This is our philosophy, these are <br/>\nthe questions I was asking at the turn of the year, and the answers.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;flavor&quot; of this list was too &quot;spicy&quot; for me at that time, so I <br/>\nunsubbed for a little while, but didn&#39;t go back to &quot;making&quot; my kids <br/>\ndo academics. Just watched. It was during that time that Katie, age <br/>\n8, took her math workbook into a little tent she had made for <br/>\nherself. She wanted to work some problems. I was folding laundry, and <br/>\nshe called me to come help her with something. &quot;Just a sec.&quot; I was in <br/>\nthe middle of a bed sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Never mind,&quot; came her soon reply. When I did get in there, two <br/>\nminutes later, she said &quot;Mom, is this right? 6 minus 4 equals 2, <br/>\nright?&quot; &quot;yep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand she explained to me, how she did it. &quot;I knew it! because, 4 plus <br/>\n2 equals 6, and I just reversed it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is when I was convinced that I never need &quot;make&quot; my kids &quot;do <br/>\nmath&quot; EVER again. Now, with all this external pressure about algebra <br/>\nand my teenaged daughter, I&#39;m more than tempted to send that article <br/>\nmy mom&#39;s way.

I pulled out a piece of paper and told him he was free <br/>\nto do the same problems if he wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he wrote down the first problem... wrote three of the numbers <br/>\nbackwards, he put a line between the two numbers being <br/>\nsubtracted (instead of one line under them both) and never did <br/>\nany borrowing...<br/>\n<br/>\nand got the right answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did the next two problems almost entirely in his head (one of <br/>\nthem involved subtracting the same number 7 times (what an <br/>\nidiotic problem! Can you imagine a page of problems like that? <br/>\nIsn&#39;t that what a calculator or the power of division is for?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing was that at one point, the other little boy finished <br/>\na problem really quickly while I was momentarily out of the room. <br/>\nMy son came dejectedly to me saying he wasn&#39;t getting it. I <br/>\nfollowed them back to the papers and as it turned out, the first <br/>\nboy didn&#39;t understand the problem... had not finished it at all. In <br/>\nthe meantime, my son had gotten most of the way through it and <br/>\nmostly correctly. He didn&#39;t know there would be anything left over <br/>\nat the end. That was it!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son used all kinds of strategies for subtracting I had never <br/>\ntaught him:<br/>\n<br/>\n110-34=?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, mom, first you take 30 from 100 and get 70. Then you add <br/>\n10 and get 80 then subtract 4 and get 76. <br/>\n<br/>\nHuh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not done math with this kid. But he gets it. :) In fact, it&#39;s me <br/>\nwho doesn&#39;t really have a clue what we&#39;re doing. I had to check <br/>\nhis sound answer with paper and borrowing because I didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand what he did.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82103,"nextTopicId":82178}}
