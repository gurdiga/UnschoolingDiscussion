That&#39;s my<br/>\nsuspicion.  I wonder if we should start warning potential unschoolers<br/>\nthat<br/>\nthey might lose some friends over giving their kids so much freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you didn&#39;t lose your friendship over parking OR unschooling,<br/>\nsorry for<br/>\nguessing wrong.<br/>\nSandra****<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL, I wish it was because I could park better.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually it had had very little to do with unschooling and a lot to do<br/>\nwith watching a family spiral out of control with lying, drug use and<br/>\nmaybe (I can&#39;t prove this part) abuse.  I couldn&#39;t stand by and watch<br/>\nanymore.  I spent the past 6-7 months trying to be there to help, but<br/>\nthere was always a new drama - one included my sweet 8 yos.  So I said<br/>\nenough and backed out of the friendship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did lose one friendship over unschooling, that was sad.  We had known<br/>\neach other for over 23 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I still park pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69895,"nextTopicId":69828}}
