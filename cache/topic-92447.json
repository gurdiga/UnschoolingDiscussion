She is gorgeous and I think when <br/>\nparents act like their kids shouldn&#39;t notice, it sends a message to their <br/>\nkids and to Shelly that something is wrong with her<br/>\nbeing in our family.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me of when I was in college at The Evergreen State College <br/>\n(btw, it is a great liberal arts school with no grades.  Today I realize it <br/>\nis pretty much an unschooling college.  It has programs where you can <br/>\ndevelop independent contracts to set up your own project and grade yourself <br/>\n- I set up an independent contract to go to Thailand for six months to study <br/>\nThai language, teach ESL, and study women&#39;s roles in Buddhism)...oops, went <br/>\noff on a tangent there...anyway, there was a girl who wrote into the school <br/>\nnewspaper.  What I remember is that she explained how people would try to <br/>\ndescribe her out of a crowd of white people.  They would say the &quot;girl with <br/>\nthe long black hair,&quot; or anything else that wouldn&#39;t actually point out her <br/>\nheritage.  She was Asian (I can&#39;t remember from where exactly), but she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand why people wouldn&#39;t just describe her as being Asian.  <br/>\nShe explained that she was proud of her heritage and knew that people were <br/>\ntrying to be PC by not singling her out, but she also knew that it was <br/>\nrather false as it would be the most obvious to describe her as being Asian.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also traveled a lot, to places like Jamaica and Thailand where I <br/>\nstuck out like a sore thumb.  All the people there always called me the <br/>\n&quot;white girl&quot; or &quot;falang&quot; (which means fat, white guava in Thai - that is <br/>\nwhat they call all white people - heh).  There wasn&#39;t this hush-hush about <br/>\nthe fact that I was different.  In a way I felt like they were saying, &quot;we <br/>\nknow you are different, but that&#39;s okay.&quot;  It just felt more straightforward <br/>\nand real.  Obviously we have different race issues here, but it&#39;s just <br/>\nsomething to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really sure if that was about unschooling, but the college part is!  <br/>\nIf any of you are looking for a great college for your kids, I would check <br/>\nit out.  Located in Olympia, Washington.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLimited-time offer: Fast, reliable MSN 9 Dial-up Internet access FREE for 2 <br/>\nmonths! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\">http://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92400,"nextTopicId":92459}}
