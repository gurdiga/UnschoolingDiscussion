Holyer<br/>\nDean of the Faculty<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One can know honor without defining it.&quot; At least, this is what one of our<br/>\nsister institutions assures its students. And there is, no doubt, something<br/>\nto it. There are many concepts of which we have a working knowledge for<br/>\nwhich we cannot give a precise definition. And honor may be one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be an honorable person, then, is not just to do the right thing, nor<br/>\nsimply to give moral considerations a central place in our lives. It is also<br/>\nto want to be known and trusted by others -- especially by other honorable<br/>\npeople -- as this sort of person. And honorable people will go to great<br/>\nlengths to maintain these bonds of trust or to re-establish them when they<br/>\nare broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again, if we were to stop here we would miss the most difficult and<br/>\nchallenging dimension of honor. To belong to a community of honor is to take<br/>\na special interest in the moral health of that community and its members<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra,<br/>\nI found the above quote through a google search.  I tried to look it up in<br/>\nthe dictionary....but I can&#39;t seem to find mine since our crazy move to the<br/>\nnew house!  I think your article explored the issue from the angle I tried<br/>\nto get at.  The original post was something about how someone didn&#39;t think<br/>\nanyone should need to follow the commandment to honor you father and mother<br/>\nsince many mothers and father are abusive to children.<br/>\n    I responded with some of my experience in choosing to honor my mother<br/>\nand father (who had been abusive....especially dad).  I would think truly<br/>\n&#39;honoring&#39; could only come from one&#39;s personal decision and<br/>\ncommitment.....*not*  becuse one has been told to by God or a a minister.<br/>\n    It will take me some time to sort out all that this experience meant to<br/>\nme.  I think I decided to &#39;honor&#39; my parents years ago (when I became a<br/>\nmature adult)....meaning to look at them more in terms of your<br/>\ndescription....to see them and grow in understanding of their wonderfulness.<br/>\nYet,  it has changed me ....though I don&#39;t yet fully know or realize the<br/>\nchanges.  After dad&#39;s funeral 10/5....it was as if I went into a cocoon for<br/>\na week - 10 days.  Right now I&#39;m slowly emerging from that cocoon.  We&#39;ll<br/>\nsee what the results are with time!<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 17, 2002 6:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Honor (was re: bible questions)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 10/15/02 4:19:30 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patti.schmidt2@...\">patti.schmidt2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; ***I don&#39;t know how you can deem who is worthy of honor and not<br/>\n&gt; worthy......isn&#39;t that being self righteous and judgemental?***<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know this thread back to the beginning, but any of the emotions<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; accompanying behaviors such as respect, honor, devotion, love, etc.<br/>\ninvolve<br/>\n&gt; the mindset and judgment of the person who is going to respect, honor,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Someone can tell me to worship God, honor my parents and respect my<br/>\nelders,<br/>\n&gt; and if I deem that to be God telling me that, I will try to do it if my<br/>\n&gt; primary philosophical consideration is to obey God.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did God love Jesus and Judas equally?<br/>\n&gt; Do we respect a serial killer lying on the witness stand as much as we<br/>\n&gt; respect an ultra-patient and wise judge?<br/>\n&gt; Do I respect a neighbor whose kids are happy and attached to their parents<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; much as one who screams insults frequently, and whose children are already<br/>\n&gt; sneaky and lying?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you only &quot;honor&quot; someone or something because you were told to there<br/>\n&gt; really is not any &quot;honor&quot; involved, but only some surface etiquette.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did someone already put up a definition of &quot;honor&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; Lots of everyday words are used by people who have never spent half a<br/>\nminute<br/>\n&gt; pondering what that really means, what that would really feel like.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is in SCA terms, but it was written by me a few years ago, and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; applicable:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/humility/formality7\">http://sandradodd.com/humility/formality7</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
