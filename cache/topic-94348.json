There are a couple of different brands on the market, I think.  It can be used with either formula or expressed breast milk.  The idea is that it stimulates milk production and keeps baby at the breast, which also helps prevent nipple confusion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNursing an adopted baby is a lot of work at first, especially if a woman&#39;s never had a child before.  I  read once that even men can lactate, under the right circumstances.  Something about tribal men in Brazil (I think) whose wives have died either during or shortly after childbirth, being able to induce lactation.  It&#39;s not like they can run down to Safeway for a can of Similac!<br/>\n<br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nthey have a device that will nourish the baby and at the same time, encourage lactation from the baby nursing on the mother. It&#39;s a little tube thing that hooks up to the breast so they baby gets nourished even if the mom doesn&#39;t have any milk or enough yet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It fascinated me and I looked<br/>\ninto it quite a bit. They actually say that it doesn&#39;t matter if you have<br/>\nhad children before or not. Most women can lactate and nurse an adoptive<br/>\nbaby. Yes I would imagine it is rare as most people probably think it&#39;s<br/>\nimpossible to do. Plus it does take time and patience. But I have read where<br/>\nwomen have done it without any kind of hormones or drugs too. You have to<br/>\nstart out with a really good breast pump and when the baby arrives, they<br/>\nhave a device that will nourish the baby and at the same time, encourage<br/>\nlactation from the baby nursing on the mother. It&#39;s a little tube thing that<br/>\nhooks up to the breast so they baby gets nourished even if the mom doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave any milk or enough yet.

You&#39;re contradicting yourself.<br/>\nI have four birth children and love every one of them differently, but with equal intensity. My dh comes from a home where he and his sister came from different birth parents, and were both adopted.<br/>\nTheir parents loved them as their own children...they WERE.<br/>\nThey also loved them differently, as they were different people. My dh has a very close relationship with his Dad, did with his Mom until she died, his sister does not. That wasn&#39;t because they loved her differently, that&#39;s just genetics and how willing people are to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWishing for all children to be loved equally means you&#39;re placing some value on &quot;different&quot; that you claim NOT to be.
