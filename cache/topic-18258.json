We also try to have a wide web of people we designate<br/>\nas &quot;safe&quot; people...that is people we can trust to keep our children&#39;s best<br/>\ninterest in mind if the need ever arose and to whom my kids could turn if<br/>\nthey felt threatened in any way.

I want to give them the autonomy to go off on their own,<br/>\nbut also the skills to maintain a level of comfort and safety.  They are<br/>\nquite discerning, too, when it comes to people...and avoid some of the<br/>\npeople that other kids find &quot;OK&quot;--rather trecely (is that how that is<br/>\nspelled) people and maintain their distance.

He had been exposed to such play by <br/>\n(possibly among others) a slightly-older neighbor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had been warned vaguely by the mom to have him keep his pants on.

The talks with her have been more along the lines of <br/>\nquestioning whether various friends (in particular, not a sweep) are nice to <br/>\nher, whether she trusts them or thinks they&#39;re nice.  Because of older <br/>\nbrothers, there are lots of older boys around, and it&#39;s worth consciously <br/>\nkeeping communication actively open with her because of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis probably sounds totally la-la and wimpy to any of you who have <br/>\nexperienced REAL bigtime sexual abuse yourself, or in cases of your kids.  <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry to be that way.
