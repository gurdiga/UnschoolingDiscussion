Two, we have to move and I won&#39;t be right next door <br/>\nto them anymore.  I love being *right there*.  I mow their yard, clean their <br/>\nhouse, take out their trash, make sure they take their meds.  I like knowing <br/>\nthat while I&#39;m here, they can still have the most independant life possible. <br/>\n  Now that we are moving, my family is talking about hiring someone to come <br/>\nin.  I know I can still help even when we move, but it&#39;s not the same as <br/>\nbeing here, in this house, right next door.  Reality is slamming me in the <br/>\nhead and I just don&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust too much crap to deal with all in one week.  I feel much better today, <br/>\nthough.  I&#39;m going to clean my house, top to bottom and get ready to start <br/>\npacking.  At least that will keep me busy and give me a good excuse to NOT <br/>\npush my silly desires of teaching onto my kids.  Well, I may teach them some <br/>\norganizational skills and packing abilities. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks, you and Sandra made me feel MUCH better.  That means a lot!  <br/>\nIt really gave me the oobie goobies (our slang for butterfly lovie feelings) <br/>\nto hear you call me Jen.  I haven&#39;t heard anyone do that since my brother <br/>\ndied.

I&#39;m missing those days of homeSCHOOLING. <br/>\n  I miss the schedule of it all.  Knowing what the majority of my day will <br/>\nbe like.  Playing &#39;teacher&#39; and making lesson plans.  For some reason, I got <br/>\na lot of *oomph* out of that.  Some feeling that I was &#39;doing the right <br/>\nthing&#39; or something.  I can&#39;t really verbalize it.  I think I&#39;m even <br/>\noverexaggerating.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur van has been down for a looong time.  It won&#39;t be ready for at least two <br/>\nmore weeks, so we are very house-bound.  We are antsy.  Full of cabin fever. <br/>\n  Needing to get out.  It&#39;s hot and humid.  Dang humid.  We have some <br/>\natmospheric smoke thing going on and two of the kids have asthma, which has <br/>\nbeen terrible this week, so even getting outside has been near impossible.  <br/>\nAs a result, my kids are doing things they normally wouldn&#39;t dream of doing. <br/>\n  Getting into the fridge and spilling an entire gallon of milk on the <br/>\nfloor.  Pulling all the books and videos off the shelves.  Ethan figured out <br/>\nhow to unlock the door today and ran next door to my great grandparents <br/>\nhouse!  I was sitting in the living room nursing Chloe.  Didn&#39;t even hear <br/>\nthe door open.  It was terrifying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s just stress, really.  My husband has been gone for weeks and <br/>\nwon&#39;t be home until next weekend.  I lost $300 in my house, somehow, and <br/>\ncan&#39;t find it anywhere.  I even dug through the trash, which had been at the <br/>\ncurb for at least two days.  It was full of maggots.  I stupidly made RICE <br/>\nfor dinner and when I sat down to eat, I immediatly envisioned a plate full <br/>\nof maggots and felt an instant wave of nausea and ran for the bathroom.  <br/>\nWhat was I thinking???<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t shake this feeling that if I were playing school, that my days <br/>\nwould have a lot more structure and the kids would be more occupied, <br/>\ndeterred from getting into everything but the attic, which they&#39;d probably <br/>\ndo right now if the string hadn&#39;t been stuck inside last time we opened it.  <br/>\nLOL<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so tell me I&#39;m being dumb.  Tell me this too shall pass.  Give me some <br/>\nwonderful bit of wisdom to carry me through the next two weeks before I go <br/>\ncurriculum hunting in my garage!  I *know* you can do it! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
