I thought one had passed away but it was just delayed in <br/>\nthe canal. I was just getting ready to reach up and pull it out thinking it <br/>\nwas gone and stuck. But a minute later she pushed him out.<br/>\nI video taped most of it, sounds gross but it was just amazing!<br/>\nMy older two children watched a few being born. It was a long night as it all <br/>\nbegan at 2am and ended at 5:38 am. I stayed up until 11am and took a short <br/>\nnap. Hard to sleep listening to them im so afraid she will lay on them but so <br/>\nfar so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had 4 boys and 1 girl. The girl was the smallest and the most white. I <br/>\nhave three &quot;girl&quot; wants on my list so im going in order of who requested first. <br/>\nWe already have one we have temp named tank as he was the first pup, fast to <br/>\nlatch and the biggest.<br/>\nMy son is asking to keep him..... <br/>\n<br/>\nSo its been a long exciting day and my body aches from sitting in the <br/>\nwhelping box with her for hours. <br/>\nThanks for reading I am soo excited. BUT glad I only have one as it was a <br/>\nlong night for her also.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87920,"nextTopicId":87772}}
