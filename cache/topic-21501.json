My son just turned 5 in April, and can&#39;t do half the stuff in the 4 year old section! He doesn&#39;t care about writing or reading or math. Yes, he knows his numbers up to 10, but to count to 100? Sheesh! And he could care less about coloring. He&#39;s working now on copying things that I write for him, like his name or I love you. He does pretty good with that. If I&#39;m not mistaken, when I was in PS, we didn&#39;t do half that stuff till 1st grade! What is this woman thinking? Some people are going to read this list and freak out because their child isn&#39;t doing that stuff. And that is just sad. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21499,"nextTopicId":21422}}
