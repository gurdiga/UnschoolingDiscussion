We use a<br/>\nWord template that is easy to lay out, is free and looks like a<br/>\nnewsletter.We have to print them and mail them. We print 5 for family and<br/>\none for us. It&#39;s fun to do and the boys have learned a ton over the years<br/>\ndoing it. They also love the attention. Like if I write and article about<br/>\none or both of them. I add pictures and examples of their work from time to<br/>\ntime. When they were young I wrote it all or typed for them while they told<br/>\nme a story or memory. Now they are 12 and 15 and they write a lot of it on<br/>\ntheir own. We usually keep it to four pages. They have become treasured<br/>\nitems. :) Have fun with it! I love the idea of having them subscribe and<br/>\ndonate postage. :) Jane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamaaj2000@...\">mamaaj2000@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, April 23, 2004 10:21 AM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Newletters was re: gifts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Most of our family is on the net, so that makes it easy to put<br/>\n&gt; something out there (mostly pictures) and let them come look when<br/>\n&gt; they want to.

I <br/>\nhope you don&#39;t complain about the gifts in front of your kids, but keep <br/>\nit to yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe told them that they&#39;re welcome to buy them all that stuff and keep it<br/>\nat their houses.  We have a space issue. I don&#39;t have a basement to<br/>\nstore unused toys.  The kids&#39; room is already full.  The corners and<br/>\nend-table cabinets in the living room are full.  The top bunk of the<br/>\nbunkbed is full.  The closet shelves are full.  Under the beds - mine<br/>\nand the kids&#39; - are full.  So when I say I&#39;m controlling the quality and<br/>\nquantity of stff, I mean stuff per square inch that my kids enjoy.<br/>\nMorgaine loves the &quot;throwaway&quot; party favors she gets at birthday<br/>\nparties.  So we still have almost all of them.  When we purge, which we<br/>\nhave to do often, I give Morgaine a small box or bag to fill - her<br/>\nchoice.  Orion is just learning to talk in sentences.  I make decisions<br/>\nabout what to get rid of for him.  He turned 2 last week.  The<br/>\nconversations I had this winter with mom and MIL were indeed private.<br/>\nThey are welcome to get the kids whatever they want, but the get very<br/>\nupset when we get rid of their gifts.  My mother gave my children,<br/>\nbetween the two of them, 5 new stuffed rabbits for Easter.  There is one<br/>\nthey like and play with, the rest are ignored.  It is likely we will get<br/>\nrid of them at the next purge.  I&#39;ll first offer them to my mom for her<br/>\nhouse.  Because she gets very upset when I give things away.  I&#39;m no<br/>\ndifferent with toys I give them that flop.  I get rid of them knowing<br/>\nany space it makes will be filled at the next holiday or event.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou said they only see them a few hours a month. So pull out the walker <br/>\nwhen they are RIGHT there and let them use it in front of them while <br/>\nyou keep a super close watch. Bring the toys THEY gave them out when <br/>\nthey are there. It&#39;ll give them joy to see them playing with things <br/>\nTHEY gave them. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey only come to our house for parties or once or twice when each baby<br/>\nis born, seldom otherwise and usually for less than an hour.  We go to<br/>\ntheir house.  The walker was a push-walker, and after he bloodied his<br/>\nnose the second time I decided the wooden walker we had gooten at a yard<br/>\nsale was just fine.  He was 10 months old; I didn&#39;t ask his permission<br/>\nto get rid of it.  When MIL asked us how he liked the walker, Morgaine<br/>\nsaid &quot;we don&#39;t have that anymore; he has a different one.&quot;  I don&#39;t lie<br/>\nwell, so when she asked what happened to it I told her.  Could I have<br/>\nthrown it in the basement?  Sure, if I had one.  But for what purpose?<br/>\nIt might be played with later, but if they want one later they will ask<br/>\nfor it.  I can&#39;t cram every toy in the whole wide world into the house<br/>\njust in case they want it one day.  So we keep what they enjoy and purge<br/>\nwhat they don&#39;t.  Morgaine doesn&#39;t wake up one day and find her dolls or<br/>\nbarbies are gone; I say, &quot;Look; the Barbie box is too full to fit under<br/>\nyour bed.  How are we going to make it fit? &quot;  &quot;There&#39;s nowhere to put<br/>\nthis toy in your room.  What can we get rid of to make a place for it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Just use it once at a family party and then <br/>\nsend it off to the Goodwill Store.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she asks about it, will you tell her you got rid of it, tell her it<br/>\nbroke, or tell her you still have it?  I just can&#39;t lie, and I&#39;m not<br/>\nvery good with fudging the truth either.  <br/>\nI have a friend who keeps everything.  When she tries to have a yard<br/>\nsale and her kids don&#39;t want to get rid of anything, she says &quot;OK.&quot;  You<br/>\ncan&#39;t walk through her house.  Most of the stuff sits untouched.  The<br/>\nstairs are full, the living room is full, the bedroom is full.  The<br/>\nbasement has just enough space for a laundry basket.  The kids have a<br/>\nfew favorite toys they play with but mostly ignore the other stuff.  I<br/>\ncan&#39;t live like that, neither can my husband, and my kids aren&#39;t happy<br/>\nlike that either.  When Morgaine was a baby I kept everything &quot;just in<br/>\ncase.&quot;  I finally realized she didn&#39;t play with anything because there<br/>\nwas just too much.  When she was about three (a few months after we<br/>\nmoved into our trailer, and before she was even sharing a room with her<br/>\nbrother) I decided to take everything out of her room that was lying in<br/>\npieces or usually not played with.  I put them into five large garbage<br/>\nbags in the shed.  I told her she had more stuff than she could take<br/>\ncare of, and we were going to put it away for a while.  She helped me<br/>\nfill the bags.  Since that day she has asked for three things out of<br/>\nthose bags.  She knows the bags are still there in the shed, because I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t gotten around to hauling them out and going through them.<br/>\n(Incidentally my shed has about 4 square feet of empty floorspace in<br/>\nfront of the door.  The rest is crammed full.)  That was very freeing to<br/>\nme - she was much happier and played more with her things and was less<br/>\nbored all the time.  She watched less TV.  She could find the things she<br/>\nwanted.  It was a joy.  It&#39;s no different than getting rid of clothes<br/>\nwhen her dresser is too full to close the drawers; she chooses the<br/>\nclothes she wants to get rid of, and usually finds clothes she&#39;d<br/>\nforgotten she had.  We do the same.  I can&#39;t count the loads I have<br/>\ntaken to the goodwill.  Now I can walk into the little storage porch we<br/>\nhave and see what I have for food.  I don&#39;t end up tossing stuff in<br/>\nthere.  If there was an emergency I could even walk through there to get<br/>\nout of the house.  We keep our small appliances out there and our<br/>\ncanning supplies, a little freezer, and some gardening tools.  Square<br/>\nfootwise, the kids have as much space as the adults do.  Control is<br/>\nnecessary sometimes; it is not always a bad thing.  I could have a house<br/>\nfull of toys people have bought them and they don&#39;t play with.  I<br/>\nsuppose I could replace their beds with shelves and they could sleep on<br/>\nour couches.  I could even replace my bed with shelves and sleep on the<br/>\ncouch with them, or on the floor since the couches don&#39;t pull out.<br/>\nAnything can be taken to an extreme, both too much control as well as<br/>\ntoo little.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKristi <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Gifts other than toys","postDate":"1082396932","msgId":92883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2MTNlNCtiZGM4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWM0MjYzMyQxNTRlZjQ2MCQ4ZTRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":92882,"nextInTopic":92887,"prevInTime":92882,"nextInTime":92884,"topicId":92836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... are dangerous in my books.

I saw her eyes light <br/>\nUP and heard her say to her daughter, &quot;Look, Aunt Pam is wearing the <br/>\noutfit we picked out for her.&quot; And her daughter (16 yo) also looked <br/>\nreally pleased. I don&#39;t have to wear the clothes again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the same thing with another gift. My daughter is a ceramicist and <br/>\nour house is overflowing with her creations - it is a problem that we <br/>\ndeal with - it is like having a cat that keeps having kittens - <br/>\neverybody we know has cupboard filled with my daughter&#39;s wonderful <br/>\ndishes and yet they keep coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that same sister, unthinkingly, BOUGHT me a lovely, but machine <br/>\nmade, ceramic tray and matching &quot;dip bowl.&quot;  There is just nowhere for <br/>\nme to keep this and it is entirely out of place with all my <br/>\none-of-a-kind handmade ceramics. So, my OTHER sister, who has more <br/>\nsense, told me quietly, &quot;Just use it once at a family party and then <br/>\nsend it off to the Goodwill Store.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Gifts other than toys","postDate":"1082378540","msgId":92863,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0LjI3M2U1MjNmLjJkYjUyMzJjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":92857,"nextInTopic":92871,"prevInTime":92862,"nextInTime":92864,"topicId":92836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/19/04 5:12:53 AM, hayes@metrocast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1805025559\">In a message dated 4/19/04 5:12:53 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hayes@...\">hayes@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I&#39;m just trying to control the quality and quantity of<br/>\nstuff - both families spend easily $50-$100 per kid, on junk, because<br/>\nthey like them to have lots of things to open.
