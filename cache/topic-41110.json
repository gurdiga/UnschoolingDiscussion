That makes it easier to do the indoctrination about how they<br/>\nshould all become &quot;employees&quot; and &quot;economic resources&quot; and consumers. Thus,<br/>\nthe estrangement you speak of is INTENTIONAL.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomework makes the parents work for the school -- and against their child.<br/>\nResult: Resentment; estrangement, a conflict of loyalty...Schools call a<br/>\nsubject, Values Clarification, when the course is intended to challenge the<br/>\nmoral views that parents teach their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools make fun of parents, even while the schools claim to want to<br/>\n&quot;involve&quot; them. But schools never allow parents to have a say in school<br/>\npolicies that affect their children or anything else that&#39;s important. (the<br/>\nPTA / PTO  is controlled by the teacher unions)  Schools want parents to do<br/>\ntheir bidding. For example: make sure the kids go door to door collecting<br/>\nmoney for the band uniforms (or whatever -- it&#39;s always something) , get the<br/>\nparents to come to school and paint the teachers&#39; lounge.....use them,<br/>\ncontrol them, make them pass the next budget with its raises for all the<br/>\nteachers (good and bad teachers), but never let them control the school --<br/>\neven though we tell the world there is this wonderful thing, Local Control<br/>\nof public schools...it&#39;s all a big lie, there is no such thing. The teacher<br/>\nunion runs the school and the school system controls the town, today.<br/>\nElected school boards are puppets (rubber stamps) of the administrators.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomework is one of the mechanisms that the public school use in order to<br/>\ncontrol, not just the children when they&#39;re not in the school building, but<br/>\nalso the parents -- their time and energies must be directed toward the<br/>\nchild and the school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen schools say they want &quot;parent involvement&quot; this is what they mean --<br/>\nhelping the school control the children, even if it means giving the family<br/>\nNO time to do things on their own, no time to take walks, etc. Time is taken<br/>\nup with school demands.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, homework makes parents part of the school program, and makes<br/>\nthem feel partly responsible for how their child does. It also allows the<br/>\nschool to blame the parents when IT is found to be failing to educate<br/>\nchildren. Public schools often blame parents and society for the schools&#39;<br/>\nfailure. Blame the victims. How convenient, but totally dishonest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s another reversal...When schools fail, they blame parents, and raise<br/>\ntheir own budgets.  The truly weird part is that no one complains.  What a<br/>\ncountry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools know that if they can make everyone preoccupied with demands, then<br/>\nparents and the public will come to believe that the school is doing<br/>\nsomething that &quot;must&quot; be important, and therefore worth all that money it<br/>\ncosts everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we know, it&#39;s not. But until that ship sinks, it is getting bigger and<br/>\nmore expensive and more consuming every day.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41109,"nextTopicId":41111}}
