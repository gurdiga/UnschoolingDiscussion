One way to  learn about the dangers<br/>\nof busy streets is being hit by a car, true. Another way is to talk about<br/>\nthe dangers of fast cars. Another is to intentionally leave something<br/>\nlike a melon in the driveway and then run over it with our car. Another<br/>\nis to crouch down in between two cars parallel-parked along a busy road<br/>\nand watch the cars zipping by at eye level, so fast they blow your hair<br/>\nback. Another is to watch how people you trust always act carefully and<br/>\ncautiously around cars and roads. <br/>\n<br/>\nPunishing a child for running in a road doesn&#39;t lead to any sort of<br/>\nlearning, IMO. That&#39;s training, or operant conditioning. The child is<br/>\nlearning a behavior, not understanding a possible risk. Training doesn&#39;t<br/>\nenable kids to make good decisions on their own, it just trains them to<br/>\nmake certain reponses to a small set of stimuli. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour posts sound like you&#39;re really frustrated with your husband and wish<br/>\nhe would help you out more. That&#39;s a valid issue. However, I think the<br/>\nway you&#39;re raising your children is more likely to result in adults like<br/>\nyour husband than in responsible, self-motivated adults, based on the<br/>\nexamples I&#39;ve seen posted to this list. <br/>\n<br/>\ndar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My children will probably never do laundry as<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; long as they live at home  but I do think they should<br/>\n&gt; be able to put the dirty clothes in the laundry room  <br/>\n&gt; they should be able to pick up their own trash  and<br/>\n&gt; put dirty dishes in the sink.

I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember now.  With<br/>\n&gt; younger kids I might remind if I noticed.<br/>\n&gt; Tia<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s &quot;learning&quot; to take responsibility for something<br/>\nsomeone else thinks is important on their timetable.  Maybe<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to take responsibility for clean clothes.<br/>\nMaybe I will want to next year (when I&#39;m 16).  Maybe it will<br/>\nnever be important to me to learn.  Isn&#39;t this analogous to<br/>\nrespecting a persons timetable for  learning to read?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you wanted or needed to be reminded, couldn&#39;t you<br/>\narrange to have someone remind you?  I subscribe to<br/>\nFlylady.net and she reminds me every day to do lots of<br/>\nthings which I then either do or don&#39;t.  But as in my late<br/>\nfor school example, it&#39;s just not true that &quot;no one reminds<br/>\nme to do laundry.&quot;  By that I mean, it is possible to find a<br/>\nway to be reminded or to have someone else do the task, or<br/>\nmany other solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I think unschooling includes not feeling that it&#39;s<br/>\nnecessary  to teach someone how to take responsibility for<br/>\noneself.   It&#39;s like everything else, if it&#39;s important to a<br/>\nperson, they will learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38546,"nextTopicId":38414}}
