Our boys have LOVED making weapons of all<br/>\nsorts, I got books like &quot;The American Boys Hand Book&quot;  and &quot;Camping and<br/>\nWilderness Survival&quot;... they spent hours drooling over stick guns, fling<br/>\nsticks and animal traps.  It&#39;s like it was bringing out some necessary<br/>\nprimitive male hunting skill in them.  We got our older boy a BB gun when he<br/>\nwas about 9 or 10 and he was fascinated with that for a few months.  I think<br/>\nit fills a great need in role playing these type of things.  I had a<br/>\npediatrician who told me &quot;If they don&#39;t play with it now, they will when<br/>\nthey&#39;re older&quot;.    Now they are a bit older, and the thrill has lost  its<br/>\nappeal... the BB gun hasn&#39;t been used for months, and the sling shot hasn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen fired for an even longer period of time.  They watch some violent<br/>\nmovies, but they opt for sci-fi or a reality based theme.  They know full<br/>\nwell the difference between a movie and real life, and have known this for<br/>\nyears.  I grew up with the cutest little silver cap gun that advanced the<br/>\nroll of caps as it shot.... I loved that thing, more for the way it<br/>\nfunctioned than that it made a bang noise I think. (And I grew up not ever<br/>\nshooting anyone!).  I suspect that was a big part of the draw of their<br/>\nweapons, some were intricately decorated and meticulously researched before<br/>\nthey were made.  I have many happy memories of those days.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle H<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Date: Fri, 24 May 2002 09:41:40 -0600<br/>\n   From: &quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: guns was Just my thought on boredom<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI have always tried to support his interest at whatever level was<br/>\nappropriate at the time. I let him play with toy guns, found books in the<br/>\nlibrary, rented him movies if he asked. We made bows and arrows, rubberband<br/>\nguns and hundreds of different swords. We played castles, Robin Hood, Peter<br/>\nPan conquers Captain Hook, Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, GI Joe and on and<br/>\non. All the while I talked and observed and listened to where he was. (Oh<br/>\nand blew away a few bad guys in the process. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMovies like Star Wars were good sources of shooting without any blood. He&#39;s<br/>\nwatched more realistic ones as he&#39;s gotten older and we&#39;ve talked, talked,<br/>\ntalked. I&#39;ve talked a lot about the difference between real guns and toy<br/>\nguns and what to do if you come across a real one. He has a cousin who<br/>\naccidentally shot himself, so that story came out when it was appropriate. I<br/>\ntried not to lecture, or sound dissapproving of his interests. But I am his<br/>\nMom and I&#39;m concerned for his safety. I like the idea of going to talk to a<br/>\npolice officer. I want to take him to a shooting range to get a gunsafety<br/>\ncourse. He&#39;s also going to be doing paintball guns.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s still sweet and gentle and cries at sad stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"TCS and Trolls","postDate":"1022273439","msgId":37391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5MTQxRkRFLjkwOTElZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0Ny5lZjAwMmU0LjJhMWZmM2E2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37387,"nextInTopic":37394,"prevInTime":37390,"nextInTime":37392,"topicId":37385,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
