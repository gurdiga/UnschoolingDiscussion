And I<br/>\nsuspect, considering where this leads, that it won&#39;t be the last scary story<br/>\nthey publish.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to About World Net Daily<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://WorldNetDaily.com/resources/about_WND.asp\">http://WorldNetDaily.com/resources/about_WND.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nyou find:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; WorldNetDaily.com is a fiercely independent newssite committed to hard-hitting<br/>\n&gt; investigative reporting of government waste, fraud and abuse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Founded by Joseph and Elizabeth Farah in May 1997 as an Internet project of<br/>\n&gt; the non-profit Western Journalism Center, WorldNetDaily.com, Inc. began<br/>\n&gt; operating as a for-profit corporation Oct. 1, 1999. Now a leading Internet<br/>\n&gt; news site in both traffic and influence, WorldNetDaily.com has broken some of<br/>\n&gt; the biggest, most significant and most notable investigative and enterprising<br/>\n&gt; stories in recent years:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; WorldNetDaily.com&#39;s editorial policy reflects the old-fashioned notion that<br/>\n&gt; the principal role of the free press in a free society is to serve as a<br/>\n&gt; watchdog on government -- to expose corruption, fraud, waste and abuse<br/>\n&gt; wherever and whenever it is found.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which makes it sound pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you Google Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center, you&#39;ll<br/>\nfind the Western Journalism Center was founded by Joseph Farah and James H.<br/>\nSmith, the former publisher of the Sacramento Union.<br/>\n<br/>\nand under the WJC FAQs it says:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.) Is the WJC conservative, liberal or what?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We subscribe to neither, nor are we the captive of any political party. We<br/>\n&gt; pursue the traditional newspaper objective:  We are a &quot;watchdog&quot; on<br/>\n&gt; government. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And yet, if you go to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/clinton/Clintonculwar8-06.htm\">http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/clinton/Clintonculwar8-06.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Western Journalism Center, (WSJ) is a project of Joseph Farah, former<br/>\npublisher of the ultra-conservative Sacramento Union-once owned by Scaife.<br/>\nThe Carthage Foundation, controlled by Scaife, is one of the largest funders<br/>\nof the WSJ.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Scaife, from some reports in the Washington Post:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife</a><br/>\n050299.htm<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Funding Father of Right<br/>\n&gt; Part One: May 2, 1999<br/>\n&gt; Richard Mellon Scaife, the Pittsburgh billionaire who has financed numerous<br/>\n&gt; anti-Clinton activities, helped fund the creation of the modern conservative<br/>\n&gt; movement in America. By compiling a computerized record of nearly all his<br/>\n&gt; contributions over four decades, The Washington Post found that Scaife and his<br/>\n&gt; family&#39;s charitable entities played a central role in the rise of the right,<br/>\n&gt; giving at least $340 million to conservative causes and institutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah. WorldNetDaily may not be &quot;captive of any political party&quot; but they&#39;ve<br/>\ngot directors and big bucks tied to a *huge* conservative agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to Conservative Web Watch<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://conwebwatch.tripod.com/stories/primer.html\">http://conwebwatch.tripod.com/stories/primer.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 3 people profiled: L.
