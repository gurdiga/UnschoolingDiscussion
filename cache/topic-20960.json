Alka Green is also sold under another name through what may be a multilevel marketing label.  I also have a line on a distributor/manufacturer of AlkaGreen that will sell it wholesale in any quantity desired - the man said, &quot;well, if you want it in a 55 gallon drum, we can do it, or if you want it in the same size jar as the store, you can have that.&quot;  I never delved further into the pricing this way as the children balk at the taste/texture after having had the Just Barley.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is even cheaper to grow at home either in dirt or hydroponically, but I&#39;m not organized enough and have enough monkeys on my back that I cannot take on the extra labor at this point, not to mention the juicing of it!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Annette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Demetria","from":"&quot;Demetria&quot; &lt;demetria@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"VEk97B6NMdHHDpVUIch93F8-a3IlX5r9Nks2KOSf-_4wez0KnqUcSeU7VvzPkLOrA7mjoerUAqc7ZtbFQHO9EucYOGPH80QSPZ0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: Barley and protein","postDate":"989442314","msgId":20961,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjMwMWMwZDhjYiRiZTY3NWU2MCQwMTAwYThjMEB1c2JsdWVzLnVzYmx1ZXMub3JnPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMwZDhjYiQ4YTQ2NTY0MCRiYjNmMmM0MkA3aGp0ODAxPg=="},"prevInTopic":20960,"nextInTopic":20966,"prevInTime":20960,"nextInTime":20962,"topicId":20960,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rachael Jeans Green Drink is the best.

I was not aware<br/>\n  that the green barley juice would alleviate the<br/>\n  problem.  What brands do you use, and how much?<br/>\n  We use either Just Barley or Alka Green.  For healing purposes, those<br/>\nwithout the fiber, just the juice are best.  AlkaGreen has more texture<br/>\nand is not as palatable.  Just Barley is a finer powder and is sweeter<br/>\ntasting, although it tastes like grass.  The Barley Green by AIM and<br/>\nother Dr. Hagiwara formulations contain maltodextrin, often derived from<br/>\ncorn.  We have severe hypoglycemic reactions to those ones, and the<br/>\npaying the barley price for the percent of maltodextrin and rice powder<br/>\nin it did not make sense either.  Initially people tend to feel sick to<br/>\ntheir stomachs when taking it.  We started out with 1/4 teaspon and<br/>\nworked up to 1-1/2 teaspoon at a time.  We take it first thing in the a.<br/>\nm. and we get along much better now, mood-wise.  We take it 2-3 times<br/>\nthroughout the day, depending on our foods, but the juice along is not<br/>\nenough as the stomach seems to need solid food too.  We try not to<br/>\ndilute our foods with liquids, to aid the digestive process and<br/>\nfacilitate healing.  The impaired digestion played into our fatigue and<br/>\nallergies and lowered immunity as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We have great success using Food for Life&#39;s Ezekiel Bread and a bagel<br/>\nby another company.  They are made from the sprouted grain only, no<br/>\nground flour.  This makes them high in amino acids, and the benefit to<br/>\nthe blood sugar is noticeable - we go much longer without eating or<br/>\ntaking the barley juice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have improved so much that I can make a blender juice out of<br/>\noranges, ice, water, and flax oil. (I add barley powder for safe<br/>\nmeasure).  Keeping the fiber of the whole fruit and using flax oil help<br/>\nthe sugars release slowly over time. I do not suffer from acidic<br/>\nreactions at all any more with this drink!<br/>\n<br/>\n  We also have seen measurable improvement by eliminating dairy and<br/>\ngluten for several months.  We also benefit from a diet high in raw<br/>\nfoods.  The nutrients are intact as well as then enzymes.  Taking<br/>\nprotein in as amino acids (as in plant foods) in better than taking in<br/>\nprotein which then needs to be broken down into aminos and then built<br/>\ninto protein again for the body&#39;s use.  Protein foods are rough on the<br/>\nkidneys over time as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a very close friend whose autistic daughter will enter school<br/>\nthis year after a miraculous recovery on a similar diet and chelation<br/>\nand enzyme and vitamin supplementation.  I suppose you are well aware of<br/>\nthese approaches.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  We have come a long way in our healing, and have a long way to go. I<br/>\ndo not have your exact circumstances, but I relate to you in so many<br/>\nways.  The life of the caregiver and the family with special dietary<br/>\nneeds is so different than the norm.  It takes so much time and energy<br/>\nto research, shop, and prepare these foods.  We do not go anywhere<br/>\nwithout a supply of food just in case something happens to delay us and<br/>\nwe need to eat.  All three girls take a full lunch box to Sunday School<br/>\n- some for snack, some just in case anything happens to them or me and<br/>\nthey need the food.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, time to go eat!
