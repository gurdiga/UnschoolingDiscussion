Whatever we read or hear,we need to think about<br/>\nhow it aplies to our own circumstances and leave the rest behind.  I also<br/>\napreciate your willingness to discuss this issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nPunished By Rewards, by Alfie Kohn, addresses the issue of how to get<br/>\nchildren to obey.  He questions that very assumption, that children<br/>\nshould &quot;obey&quot; their parents.  He suggests that a more useful long term<br/>\ngoal is to help children learn to make choices that lead to a moral <br/>\nlifestyle.  A child who learns only to do what he is told will be lost<br/>\nwhen no one is there to tell him what to do.  I recommend this book for<br/>\nanyone who lives with children and has the long term goal of raising a<br/>\nperson who will someday take care of themselves and be a productive and<br/>\nmoral member of society.  It also has good advice for those who supervise<br/>\nothers in the workforce.  No, he does not recommend a chaotic household<br/>\nwhere everyone does whatever they want -- he stresses cooperation and<br/>\nconsidering a child&#39;s developmental level and most important, for the<br/>\nparent to live a life of example.  No matter what we say, kids learn by<br/>\nwhat we do.  And hitting a child is hitting, no matter what we call it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nWe are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for ten or fifteen<br/>\nyears,<br/>\nand come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.<br/>\nRalph Waldo Emerson<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.<br/>\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!<br/>\nTry Juno Web: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.\">http://dl.www.juno.com/dynoget/tagj.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3582,"nextTopicId":3587}}
