The funny thing is, my<br/>\n&gt; children (and I) are perfectly happy this way, playing with cousins<br/>\n&gt; once or twice a month, and that&#39;s it....   However, *everyone* keeps<br/>\n&gt; telling me, and I have even seen it here on this list, that I should<br/>\n&gt; make sure my children have plently of contact with other kids.  So,<br/>\n&gt; of course, I start to wonder if I am harming my children in some<br/>\n&gt; way!  They have each other and thier pen-pals and e-mail pals and<br/>\n&gt; they read and play for hours on end with each other, wander through<br/>\n&gt; the fields, play with animals, etc.<br/>\n&gt; I, personally, don&#39;t see close friends or even family even once a<br/>\n&gt; week but have pen-pals and e-mail friends and love getting together<br/>\n&gt; with my sisters and mom once or twice a month.  In general, we are<br/>\n&gt; homebodies, and happiest at home.<br/>\n&gt; Mary from IA<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mary, Your thing sounds fine to me. I didn&#39;t mean to imply otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy posts about a kid needing a friend, a peer, is intended for kids who are<br/>\nisolated from others their age. I believe it is important for children to<br/>\nrelate to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41354,"nextTopicId":41356}}
