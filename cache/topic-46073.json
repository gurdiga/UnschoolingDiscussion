I have<br/>\nto comment on the &quot;lazybones&quot;, nicknames issue.  My MIL says everything with a<br/>\nsmile, no matter how negative. The last time she visited she talked about how<br/>\nlazy my husband was as a child, she laughed and talked about it in a<br/>\ngood-natured way.  I watched my husband smile and wince the whole time.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nlived with him for 12 years I know it hurt him, she doesn&#39;t acknowledge it or<br/>\nknow it.  My husband tends to excuse everything she says even if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike it, because she says everything so &quot;lovingly&quot;.  If he calls her on it,<br/>\nwho looks like the spoilsport? She&#39;s just being affectionate, right?  The<br/>\nmother who calls her son lazybones writes in one of her posts that the son<br/>\nenjoys the nickname.  Well maybe he sees that you enjoy it and approve of it,<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t mean he enjoys it.  It may take him years to admit that he hates<br/>\nit, just like it has my husband.  Children usually can&#39;t sort out complex<br/>\nemotions and feelings until much later.  Right now all he knows is Mommy finds<br/>\n&quot;lazybones&quot; cute, later on he may realize that Mommy was comparing him to his<br/>\nmore active sibling, negatively.  You may say it&#39;s not a negative comparison<br/>\nbut the first post on this &quot;lazy&quot; issue spoke volumns, every post after that<br/>\nis just defensiveness.  I&#39;m not trying to be mean, just truthful.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nunconsciously done the labeling thing to my own son.  Fortunately I&#39;ve had<br/>\nfriends and family call me on it and I&#39;ve taken into account what they have to<br/>\nsay.  Other people are not always right in their opinion but I figure if the<br/>\nissue is presenting itself to me there is a damn good reason and I better look<br/>\nat it closely before I dismiss it.  I&#39;d urge you to do the same.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45814,"nextTopicId":46077}}
