He seemed surprised that that could  happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him that some of those who are filmed are not<br/>\nquite  volunteers <br/>\nand<br/>\ntold him two stories, one of the mom of girls his age<br/>\nhe&#39;s  known his <br/>\nwhole<br/>\nlife,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son first got Vice City, (he was 9?) from his<br/>\nDad, and I saw it, the first scene I saw was a guy,<br/>\nthe hero, walking along the beach, punching out women<br/>\nin bikinis who kept walking up to him.<br/>\nI told him the following: many women who might<br/>\napproach a man in public with the intention of<br/>\nproposing a trade of sex for money are probably single<br/>\nmoms trying to feed their kids. If you&#39;re not<br/>\ninterested, an appropriate response might be no thank<br/>\nyou, not punching them out. (I didn&#39;t go into all the<br/>\npermutations and exceptions) This seemed to work. He<br/>\ndidn&#39;t develop a habit of punching out naked women in<br/>\nvideogames.<br/>\nAnna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
