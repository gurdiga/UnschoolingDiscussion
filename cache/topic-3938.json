Your story is very <br/>\ninteresting and I agree strongly with your message.  I don&#39;t know if my dad <br/>\nhas reached a level of confidence yet where he values himself for who he is <br/>\ncompletely but I would like to print up your essay and have him read it.<br/>\n     One side thing I thought about while reading this: with a passion for <br/>\nGerman Literature, you must have read Goethe.  I am just starting to read <br/>\nhim, having read some of his quotes in other books.  Are there any of his <br/>\nwritings that you would recommend in particular?  I am totally new to it.  <br/>\nThe book I bought is Goethe The Collected Works Volume 4,  From My Life  <br/>\nPoetry and Truth (Parts One to Three).  I know I will probably lose some of <br/>\nthe flavor of it reading it in English but I&#39;m afraid my German is limited to <br/>\nthings like, &quot;How much does that cost?&quot; and &quot;Where is the bathroom?&quot; from the <br/>\nthree years we lived in Germany.  <br/>\n     As always, thanks for sharing your thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\n      Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"John O.

In many cases, getting a degree is more an indicator of how good a<br/>\nteamplayer one is rather than how much one actually learned.  I have no<br/>\ndoubts that your dad is a better historian than your degreed sister.  He<br/>\nprobably learns history for more authentic, long-range, and significant<br/>\nreasons than just to get certified and qualify for a job.  Also, his many<br/>\nadditional years of life give him the basis to understand history in a way<br/>\nthat young worldly inexperienced college students could never grasp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He feels embarrassed at times about his job because it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not prestigious and he has friends who are making a lot more money but I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>am<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; always telling him that what he&#39;s doing is really important for those<br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd someday he may be remembered fondly by many of them.
