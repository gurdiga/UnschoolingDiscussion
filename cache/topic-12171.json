Anyway, I will try <br/>\nto e-mail you privately -- thanks for the offer and advice!.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie -- thanks for the book suggestions regarding 3yo dd -- I find reading <br/>\nhas helped me better understand that, well, she is 3 and that is what 3 year <br/>\nolds do!  Reading always seems to keep my attitude in check so I will &quot;check&quot; <br/>\nout your suggestions!
