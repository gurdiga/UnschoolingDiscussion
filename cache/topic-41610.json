Keep<br/>\nyour grass clippings right on your lawn. As for leaves, simply run over them<br/>\nwhen they fall and they fertilize the grass too. No waste. no trucks. If you<br/>\nhave vegetable gardens, make a compost pile using the leaves and grass<br/>\nclippings of your yard and collect your neighbors&#39; also. Pile it together<br/>\nand mix it up. In a few months, you have the best plant food there is. Just<br/>\nspread it on any garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeen doin&#39; that for years and have the finest gardens possible.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41624,"nextTopicId":41504}}
