He must be a very passionate person about his <br/>\nbeliefs, and that is a wonderful thing.  And those who have taken <br/>\noffense must be very passionate as well.  I love that high interest <br/>\nand intelligence in people and hope to continue to see it on this <br/>\nlist.  But I truly hope one person will not be kicked off the list <br/>\nfor a bad choice of words or an all-consuming passion, or I might be <br/>\nnext for not vaccinating my children!  :o)   (or, at least, in <br/>\nchoosing *fighting words* to villify my beliefs!)<br/>\nBy the way, I&#39;m 42, and I kind of thought &quot;wussy&quot; just meant someone <br/>\nnot real brave, or that wouldn&#39;t stand up for what they believe!<br/>\nThanks to all of you for your stimulating conversations lately. <br/>\nMary from IA (to distinguish myself from the other Mary that posts <br/>\nregularly on here)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this post Mary.  It said exactly what I&#39;ve been thinking.  I must<br/>\nsay that I&#39;m a little offended by the posters who claim to be protecting my<br/>\ndelicate newbie sensibilities.  I think that anyone who chooses to unschool is<br/>\nmost likely a brave sort, who makes up their own mind.  If I decided not to<br/>\nunschool based on a disagreement on this list than I wasn&#39;t committed to it<br/>\nanyway.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought unschooling was about learning by simply living, so I&#39;ve never<br/>\nthought this list was about someone telling me HOW to unschool.  If it is,<br/>\nthan I don&#39;t need it.  But if it&#39;s about learning something new from different<br/>\npeople, with different perspectives and philosophies than I&#39;ll take it.
