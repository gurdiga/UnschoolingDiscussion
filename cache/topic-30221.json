The medical issues have to be dealt with first.<br/>\nLet&#39;s take another example. Let&#39;s say I have a child who can&#39;t read because she says the pages are blurry. One could assume she needs her eyes checked and perhaps needs glasses.  It would be my responsibility to look into that with a professional medical person. But if I *didn&#39;t* yet I responded to every poster who wrote in saying they were having trouble with their kid reading by suggesting that unschooling might not work because it&#39;s not working for my dd, then I can see why everybody on the list would be defensive and counter my posts with strong rebuttals. It&#39;s not working for *me* because *I&#39;m* not addressing the underlying issue first!<br/>\nIf there&#39;s another list out there that would fill my needs better than this one, I&#39;d want somebody to point me in that direction.

Telling them that they are just not unschooling right <br/>\n&gt; and that is where all the problems come from is just plain <br/>\n&gt; insensitive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll even begin by agreeing with you - yes, there are other parents out<br/>\nthere struggling with issues of TV, and reading, and all sorts of of<br/>\nthings. That&#39;s why this list is here - because people do struggle with<br/>\nthese issues. It is difficult to relinquish control, to give your<br/>\nchildren the freedom to develop at their own pace and find their own<br/>\nlimits. Mainstreamia is out there saying, &quot;If you don&#39;t force your kids<br/>\nto do X and Y, they&#39;ll never learn and grow up to be Bad People.&quot; That&#39;s<br/>\nhard to buck...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure there is a such thing as unschooling &quot;right&quot;. There&#39;s<br/>\nunschooling and there&#39;s not unschooling, and calling one the other<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t change anything. I&#39;ll fall back on my vegetarianism example - if<br/>\nyou want to only eat meat when you&#39;re over at grandma&#39;s house every<br/>\nmorning, it&#39;s not that you&#39;re doing vegetarianism &quot;wrong&quot;, you&#39;re just<br/>\nnot a vegetarian. Which is fine - hell, I&#39;m not a vegetarian - but if<br/>\nyou&#39;re on a vegetarian list and someone posts about problems with, say, <br/>\nlow iron, suggesting that the person eat meat every morning at grandma&#39;s<br/>\nis not going to be a welcome suggestion, nor should it be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, sinec this is a list for supporting people in their unschooling<br/>\nendeavors, if you (or anyone else) decide you want to unschool your son,<br/>\nand you want to share your struggles and ask for help and support, we<br/>\nwill all be here to help you make it work. If you (or anyone) decide you<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to unschool your son, I&#39;m happy to send people subbing info<br/>\nfor other homeschooling lists, or schooling lists, where there are people<br/>\nto support and help those making that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

So I went to get the maple<br/>\nsyrup, and my dad (her son) came out to the kitchen with me and whispered<br/>\n&quot;If I ask for maple syrup in my wine when I&#39;m 88, please just shoot me&quot;,<br/>\nbut she apparently liked it...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story she tells almost every time we see her is about how when she<br/>\nstarted first grade, she didn&#39;t speak English very well (she emigrated<br/>\nfrom Germany as an infant) and the kids would all tease her by singing<br/>\n&quot;Irene Bauer, sitting in a tower, eating sauerkraut by the hour!&quot; And she<br/>\nalways laughs at this story... and I keep thinking how incredibly hurtful<br/>\nit must have been at the time, to be 6 years old and heading off alone to<br/>\na place where you didn&#39;t really know the language, and where people<br/>\nlaughed at you because you were German-American. She doesn&#39;t remember it<br/>\nas hurtful at all, she lauhs and laughs... which to me just points out<br/>\nhow dissociated she really is from her feelings...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve rambled a lot, but my original point was that *I* do think<br/>\nunschooling &quot;works&quot; for all kids, and since this is an unschooling list,<br/>\nI figured someone ought to say that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
