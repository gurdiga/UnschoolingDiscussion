If this was a once and awhile meeting--- family thanksgiving and everyone wanted to go to grandmas, or the other mom was taken ill and this was the quickest place to leave the child...then I would feel okay telling the child X is going to be there and we&#39;ll just have to deal with it.   Here are my ideas.  If they came up with their own, that is great.  For a 3 year old it really would have to be a rare occasion...I&#39;m speaking of a couple of times a month.  For an older child...say at about 6, it could be more frequently, especially since they have more options on where they could choose to go and what they could choose to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in this situation, what is being talked about with the two three year olds, is frequent, unwanted (at least by one party) forced contact.  And that to me isn&#39;t okay.  I know of a particular person my dh likes, and frankly I don&#39;t want him near me!  He may be perfectly harmless, but something about him makes me uncomfortable.  My dh is always trying to tell me it is because he is slow or this or that.  Not true. I can deal with people who are slow, I have before.  I just have this visceral, don&#39;t come near feeling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have to like everyone? Does my dh have the right to make me have him for dinner frequently?  Stay and talk with him?  How absurd.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize the child is a cousin, but there are alternatives.  The original reason for the child saying *I don&#39;t like him* may be gone, and it may just be a game.  But till it is all worked it is unfair to both children to force them to be together.   Even if the child retains a antipathy toward her cousin she can learn to express her desire to be left alone in a more socially acceptable way, and learn to tolerate an occasional time together.  But not at age 3 when her options to stay away and not play with him are so limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nJMHO<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; When I wrote &quot;live with it&quot; I was addressing the child who was <br/>\n  &gt; expressing<br/>\n  &gt; the anger towards the other children.
