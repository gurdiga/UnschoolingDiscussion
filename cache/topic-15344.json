It did take me days to get <br/>\nready for company because our house is always an obvious testimony to <br/>\nthe fact the we have 3 children who are home most of the time and who <br/>\nhave the freedom to explore our world!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big question last night to my 8yo was, &quot;What did you do in school <br/>\ntoday?&quot;.  I was a little surprised when he responded, &quot;I took the day <br/>\noff.&quot;  That must have meant that he was busy helping Mom clean and <br/>\nhelp get meals ready for the younger two.  Or it may have meant that <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t know quite how to respond!?  The funny part, to me, is that <br/>\nI didn&#39;t hear anyone ask the ps children what THEY did in school that <br/>\nday!  I think that when people come here they expect to find a <br/>\nclassroom in one of our rooms.  I think that they have a hard time <br/>\nseeing our whole house as the &quot;classroom&quot;, but each room reflects <br/>\nexactly that.  My s-i-l (with no children) told my son that she felt <br/>\nbad for him that he didn&#39;t get to play games at school for his <br/>\nbirthday!  Do ps children really have all day long to play and <br/>\ncelebrate their birthdays?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s family doesn&#39;t ask me about homeschooling or <br/>\nunschooling, and I know that they themselves really don&#39;t know <br/>\nanything about either except that it&#39;s different or weird to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home, since the day my first was born, I&#39;ve shared a bed with <br/>\nmy children.  I could never imagine it any other way.  There were <br/>\nmany times over the years that I&#39;ve felt like they &quot;should&quot; be <br/>\nsleeping in their own beds since that&#39;s the way everyone does it.  My <br/>\n6yo daughter does sleep in her own bed every night and has for years <br/>\n(does not like sleeping in our bed at all, but occassionally likes me <br/>\nto sleep in her bed).  Whenever I &quot;should&quot; on myself, I normally <br/>\nregret it because what my heart says and what &quot;should&quot; says are <br/>\nnormally polar opposites!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother-in-law took the opportunity last night to talk to my sons <br/>\nto try to convince them that they should be sleeping in their own <br/>\nbeds, starting last night!!  My 3yo told grandma that Jason the 8yo <br/>\nwas going to sleep in my bed forever and take it with him when he <br/>\nmoves out!!!  I loved it, especially because that&#39;s exactly what <br/>\nJason says.  We do have a baby due in March and Jason is talking a <br/>\nlot about sleeping in his own bed.  We&#39;ll have to see how that goes <br/>\nwhen the baby comes home.  With this fourth child, I see little point <br/>\nin even bringing the crib out because I know that he&#39;ll sleep in my <br/>\nbed at home, just like he&#39;ll sleep in my arms at the hospital, much <br/>\nto the nurses&#39; dismay!<br/>\n<br/>\nI whole-heartedly support &quot;shared sleep&quot;, if that&#39;s what&#39;s right for <br/>\nyour family and only you know that.  Just like all of the other <br/>\ndifferent or weird decision we&#39;ve made with raising our children!<br/>\n<br/>\nA normal morning in our house would be my children doing their own <br/>\nthing up until about lunchtime.  I think that they felt that their <br/>\nfamily is expecting them to be &quot;schooling&quot; all day so this morning <br/>\nthey got out magnets and we played, discussed and experimented.  Then <br/>\nout came the clock and I was asked for a &quot;lesson&quot; in time by my <br/>\ndaughter.  By lunchtime, I was schooled-out and escaped to these <br/>\nmessage boards to hear from so many like-minded people!<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my 2 cents on some recent topics!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\nMommy to Jason (8), Angela (6-1/2), Daniel (3-1/2) and baby due in <br/>\nMarch!!<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  2000 years doesn&#39;t really change things much, individuals will <br/>\nalways have their belief or disbelief in who Jesus is (or was, for <br/>\nsome).  I agree with keeping this particular message board to <br/>\nunschooling.  Maybe there is a place out in egroups that is both <br/>\nunschooling and religious, or maybe someone can start one for a place <br/>\nto share ideas...another$.02</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15289,"nextTopicId":15384}}
