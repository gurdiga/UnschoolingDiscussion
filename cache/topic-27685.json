I think. At least I can find<br/>\nresearch that supports my feeling that tv does have an<br/>\nimpact on children, both positive and negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it is anything less than obvious that<br/>\nwoman are not depicted as positive role models all<br/>\nthat often on tv. Especially in cartoons. There are<br/>\nmany out there that do make attempts to do better, but<br/>\nlets face it. It is quite clear that how women are<br/>\ndepicted on tv and the media adversely affects a teens<br/>\nself image. How many near anorexic models do that have<br/>\nto look at before they feel they are not attractive? <br/>\nDid you ever take a look at home much sex and alcohol<br/>\nare in tv shows? MTV is littered with it, about 1/4 of<br/>\ntheir programming has alcohol abuse in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly two-thirds of all television programming<br/>\ncontains violence, and children&#39;s shows contain the<br/>\nmost violence, according to a recent study.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeuroscientists have shown that environmental<br/>\nexperiences significantly shape the developing brain<br/>\nbecause of the plasticity of its neuronal<br/>\nconnectivity. Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus<br/>\nin a child&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental<br/>\nand emotional growth, either by setting up particular<br/>\ncircuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by depriving the brain<br/>\nof other experiences. While appropriate stimuli �<br/>\nclose interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>\ninteractive, human language environment; engrossing<br/>\nhands-on play opportunities; and age-appropriate<br/>\nacademic stimulation � enhance the brain&#39;s<br/>\ndevelopment, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>\npassivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity,<br/>\nviolence), or deprive the brain of important chances<br/>\nto participate actively in social relationships,<br/>\ncreative play, reflection and complex problem-solving<br/>\nmay have deleterious and irrevocable consequences. In<br/>\naddition, trying to plunge youngsters into academic<br/>\nlearning, when they should be personally investigating<br/>\nthe three-dimensional world, risks bypassing important<br/>\naspects of development.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, limiting what they see, or if I am<br/>\navailable, watching it with them, is the only way to<br/>\naddress it. By watching it with them, I can help them<br/>\ndevelop media literacy. With those skills, than yes, I<br/>\nagree, much of what&#39;s on television can be positive<br/>\nviewing experiences. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching media literacy skills to a very young child<br/>\nis difficult. As is sitting with them all day and<br/>\nwatching tv, if that&#39;s what they are choosing to do. I<br/>\nwould hesitate to let the tv remain on, without being<br/>\nable to point out the indiscrepancies between reality<br/>\nand tv. The road runner only goes from being flattened<br/>\nto a healthy road runner on tv. Doesn&#39;t happen in<br/>\nreality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nI have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a <br/>\nburden to bear.--<br/>\nMartin Luther King, Jr.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind the one for you at Yahoo!
