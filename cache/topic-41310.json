Thus, those of us following Him should try <br/>\nto exemplify this same pattern, is my thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully you will recover soon.<br/>\nAgain, I am sorry.  We aren&#39;t all like your relatives.<br/>\nBj<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  There is no saracasm or cynicism in this note so please don&#39;t read into <br/>\nit as being of that nature.<br/>\nI am sincere in my empathy!  (In other words, I am not wanting a bunch of <br/>\nslams in return, for those of you who read into this, perhaps, as being <br/>\nsarcastic or such.. thanks!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41308,"nextTopicId":41311}}
