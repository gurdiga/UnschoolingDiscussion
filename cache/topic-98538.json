I see so many kids who <br/>\ndon&#39;t *seem* that way-but I also don&#39;t see them at home in a relaxed, un-public <br/>\natmosphere.<br/>\nI think a lot of my little brother being born trauma is part of my worry, <br/>\nhere, too. I was also 3 (and 3 weeks), and my brother was born with Spina <br/>\nBiffida, which most people hadn&#39;t heard of to that point (late 60s), and up until the <br/>\nmid 60&#39;s, was pretty much fatal. My parents changed (which never really <br/>\noccurred to me until I was married many years) into quite different, somber, <br/>\nworried, fretful, fearful people-so not only did I get a &quot;someone&quot; to share my <br/>\nparents attention, I got a &quot;different set &quot;of parents along with it. I think <br/>\nrealising this has helped ease that concern for him, but he&#39;s also been the only <br/>\nchild for 2 1/2 years longer than I was. BUT, he&#39;s also more mature because of <br/>\nit...<br/>\nI think we&#39;re doing okay in the &quot;don&#39;t  present the bad stuff&quot; area... He&#39;s <br/>\nvery excited about changing diapers, holding, carrying, teaching, etc.-even <br/>\nwanted the baby to sleep in his room, until I explained about the crying babies <br/>\nsometimes do in the middle of the night, and napping he would have to play <br/>\nalmost silently through... so now he&#39;s happy to have the baby in the room next to <br/>\nhis. He DID surprise me one day by referring to the baby as &quot;your&quot; baby-but I <br/>\nwas quick to let him know it was ALL our baby-Daddy, Wyl and Mama&#39;s. People <br/>\noutside of the three of us don&#39;t help, though-they think they are, but my Dad is <br/>\nespecially ... severe-telling him very somberly that he will have lots of <br/>\nRESPONSIBILITY when the baby comes, and &quot;you know, you won&#39;t be able to ____ <br/>\n(shout, run recklessly through the house, whatever) when the baby comes, and stuff <br/>\nlike that. He *thinks* he&#39;s helping, but it worries me...<br/>\nMaybe its all just pre-new baby jitters...? I don&#39;t know-last time, all I <br/>\ncould focus on was the delivery and the *pain* that no one would tell me anything <br/>\nabout-except &quot;its the easiest pain to forget&quot;. ::eyeroll:: not helpfull. But, <br/>\nnow I know what to expect at labor time, so maybe my focus is moving to the <br/>\nunknown step beyond that?

We do often (now) discuss things that might <br/>\ncome up on a show, such as hitting or meanness, but it rarely comes up, now. <br/>\nI&#39;m kind of looking to the future more when his interests expand and as my <br/>\nparents are buying more &quot;non name brand&quot; videos that have some scary ideas in them <br/>\n(such as a group of 5 very young bunnies running off into the forest to find <br/>\ntheir baby brother who was kidnapped by foxes without telling police or <br/>\nparents, etc.). Oddly enough, I find the &quot;adult&quot; stuff with much less controversial <br/>\nsubjects than the kiddie stuff! LOL He loves Guys and Dolls and other <br/>\nmusical/stage stuff, and we really don&#39;t try to &quot;ban&quot; anything, but he has a very low <br/>\nscare factor, so he can&#39;t sit through much of anything (Nemo-the sharks scare <br/>\nhim, Shrek 2, the Fiona kissing Prince Charming scared/upset him, etc.)., but <br/>\nwe let him try and either turn it off or fast forward through the scary parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to being afraid of the dark, perhaps he was just trying out<br/>\nwhat he saw on TV to see how you would react.<br/>\nThat&#39;s a possibility. I hadn&#39;t thought of that... though it has been going on <br/>\nfor several years, now, so I&#39;m *thinking* that probably isn&#39;t it... but I&#39;ll <br/>\nbe more observant on that front to see.

But, now I see how the swordplay, video games, and other <br/>\nideas don&#39;t quash his imagination-they stimulate it quite a lot! He makes up <br/>\nhis own &quot;video games&quot; with wooden blocks and action figures on his floor, makes <br/>\nup wonderful stories with the characters from games and stuff he&#39;s watched, <br/>\ndraws intricate pictures and puts them with stories from the same sources.

It gives us the opportunity<br/>\nto talk about how we treat each other.  Which type of family would you<br/>\nrather live in, one where you talk about differences and work things out, or<br/>\none where they scream at each other and treat each other hatefully?  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my kids were toddlers I felt similar to you in that I didn&#39;t want them<br/>\nexposed to nasty behavior before they&#39;d have thought of it themselves.  I<br/>\nwas concerned that they would imitate the mean behavior they saw on TV.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t go to all the trouble that you do to keep it from them, though, and<br/>\ngradually, as they saw more of that type of show, I realized that my fears<br/>\nwere unfounded because they didn&#39;t automatically start acting like the kids<br/>\non TV.  That sounds like a lot of work to tape everything before you watch<br/>\nit.  What happens when you want to watch something *now* instead of after<br/>\nit&#39;s taped?  <br/>\n <br/>\nWith regards to being afraid of the dark, perhaps he was just trying out<br/>\nwhat he saw on TV to see how you would react.  My kids have never been<br/>\nafraid of the dark or had nightmares despite the fact that they&#39;ve watched<br/>\nsome pretty scary stuff.  They like me to lie down with them while they go<br/>\nto sleep and I still do.  I enjoy the snuggle time and the talking that<br/>\nhappens at the end of the day.  They don&#39;t lie there with their imaginations<br/>\nrunning wild with no one to talk to.  &lt;reminds me of a Junie B. Jones book<br/>\nwe just read where her parents make her go to bed alone and scared even<br/>\nthough she is afraid of the monster under her bed.  The kids wanted to know<br/>\nwhy she just couldn&#39;t sleep with her parents.  It seemed so mean.&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s always a good idea to be there with your son when he watches a show so<br/>\nyou can answer any questions he might have or talk about what you see.<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\ngame-enthusiast@...<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Sanguinegirl83@...
