Here’s a <br/>\ncouple of examples:<br/>\n J Dr. Gaesser documents more than 20 studies over the last 20 years that <br/>\nshow weight loss (either intentional or unintentional) actually increases the <br/>\nrisk of premature death. Of the few studies finding longer life with weight loss, <br/>\none documents an 11-hour increase in longevity per pound of weight lost. <br/>\nGaesser observes that results from this study suggest a person would have to lose <br/>\n796 pounds to gain an additional year of life.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.uwyo.edu/winwyoming/bullets/2002/bullets11-02.htm\">http://www.uwyo.edu/winwyoming/bullets/2002/bullets11-02.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194965079,"authorName":"Pam Tellew","from":"Pam Tellew &lt;pamtellew@...&gt;","profile":"warblwarbl2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Food issues, unschooling","postDate":"1128224844","msgId":108686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMi4xLjEuMC4yMDA1MTAwMTIwMzMyOS4wMmYxYWUwOEBtYWlsLmludGVyZ2F0ZS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMjgyMjE5NjYuMjE0NS40ODk2MC5tMzVAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108692,"prevInTime":108685,"nextInTime":108687,"topicId":108686,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
