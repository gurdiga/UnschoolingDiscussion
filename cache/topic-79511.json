Between ages 5 and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-681176339\">I posted some of this elsewhere last week, but now Rain wants to share<br/>\nher writing with this group, so the background seemed appropriate..<br/>\n<br/>\n Between ages 5 and her 10th birthday last January, I&#39;d estimate Rain<br/>\ncreated maybe 20 pieces of writing, total. I&#39;m not including things like<br/>\nsigning in at dance class or adding an item to the shopping list, but<br/>\nanything with more than 2 or 3 words. Most were notes and letters, a few<br/>\nwere poems, a few were comic strips, one or two were political<br/>\nstatements... but none were longer than a few sentences, except maybe the<br/>\ncharacter bio she had to write last summer. They were spread pretty<br/>\nevenly over those 5 years, too. Her mechanical skills improved some over<br/>\nthat time, slowly (although the &quot;gap&quot; between her skills and the<br/>\nexpected-for-grade-level skills continued to grow), but there was very<br/>\nlittle substance to what she wrote. The average schooled kid probably<br/>\nwrites much more in a month than she wrote in 5 years.<br/>\n <br/>\nLast Spring she started to write a little more . She discovered the Bio<br/>\nfeature on The Sims and created bios for a couple dozen Sims, all<br/>\nhumorous in a 10 year old way, none more than 3 or 4 sentences long. She<br/>\nstarted passing notes during some of the shows she was doing, sometimes<br/>\nin character. She also made some friends who were into email, and got her<br/>\nown email address and started sending and receiving emails. In the<br/>\nbeginning she asked me questions, mostly about spelling, but she figured<br/>\nout how to set up her account so spellcheck would run automatically<br/>\nwhenever she sent something, and 99% of the time her spelling is close<br/>\nenough for spellcheck to fix. One of her best friends spent a month in<br/>\nEurope this summer, so they sent quite a few emails. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I wasn&#39;t seeing much of what she was writing, buhe quantity seemed to<br/>\nbe picking up a bit. The things I did see were very preteen-note style -<br/>\n&quot;Arrrghhhhh! I am soooooo frustrated!!!!!&quot;  - and so on. Then a week or<br/>\nso ago, while we were walking our dogs, she was telling me about an idea<br/>\nshe had for a series of books. Ideas for books are nothing new for Rain;<br/>\nshe has lots of ideas and stories in her head, she just never wants to<br/>\nwrite them down, or dictate them to me. I listened and said something<br/>\nabout how she had such interesting ideas and good descriptive skills, and<br/>\nI was really looking forward to reading her stories some day. I&#39;ve<br/>\noccasionally said similar things to her before, for years, so it was just<br/>\nsort of conversation... but then that evening she sat down and started<br/>\nwriting, and filled almost a page in a spiral notebook. I aksed to see it<br/>\nbut she wasn&#39;t ready yet, but after writing a little more the next day<br/>\nshe let me read it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was, and am, impressed. I had expected writing to be a process that<br/>\nstarted with simple sentences and pieces and then slowly became more<br/>\ncomplex and detailed. I didn&#39;t expect her to go from never writing a<br/>\npiece of fiction to creating the piece below. I guess this was another of<br/>\nmy blind spots, since reading happened much the same way - a few years of<br/>\nplaying with words and letters and books, then a 6 month period of<br/>\nslightly more intense reading experiences, then she could read almost<br/>\nanything fluently and competently.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Rain wanted me to share the beginning of the first chapter of her<br/>\nfirst story with an unschooling list, so people could see that &quot;when kids<br/>\ndecide they want to write they can&quot;. She&#39;s written a little more but<br/>\nisn&#39;t sure if she&#39;s keeping it, so she didn&#39;t want anyone to read it<br/>\n(including me). I did correct the spelling and punctuation, at her<br/>\nrequest, although there weren&#39;t a lot of errors (which also surprised<br/>\nme).<br/>\n<br/>\nHer next plan is for an unschooling kids zine... stay tuned!<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                                                                Hank<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a cold November morning, the wind was blowing, snow was falling, and a<br/>\nkindly old man was standing on the sidewalk, selling newspapers from a<br/>\nstand he had built himself.
