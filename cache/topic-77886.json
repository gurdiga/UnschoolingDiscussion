I know I&#39;ve promised and promised to <br/>\nwrite this, but, due to some crazy circumstances, I just haven&#39;t been able to.  <br/>\nFirst the computer &quot;blew up,&quot; then my cable modem went out (as it would be, <br/>\nright in the middle of trying to write this letter the last time, and before I <br/>\ncould hit send).  But, OH well, that&#39;s life, and now I FINALLY HAVE THE CHANCE <br/>\nTO SHARE ABOUT MY DAUGHTER&#39;S AWESOME FORTUNE!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo begin with, tomorrow she gets to leave for an AWESOME, probably once in a <br/>\nlifetime trip.  Before I say just where, I do want to extend my thanks (not <br/>\nbecause I am sending this to anyone there, but because I hope you will all find <br/>\nnew found respect for them) to the Cincinnati Museum Center and their Youth <br/>\nVolunteer Program.  If it weren&#39;t for them, this trip wouldn&#39;t even be possible <br/>\nfor my daughter.  I hope if you live in & around Cincinnati, you will visit <br/>\ntheir wonderful Museums & look into the program for your own teens (13 years and <br/>\nup).  If you don&#39;t live here, I hope if you come &quot;passing thru&quot; you&#39;ll decide <br/>\nto stop for a while (if you do, let me know, my DD, may be able to help you <br/>\nout with some free tickets).  Mostly, I thank Don Whittrock & assistant Arden; <br/>\nthey are the ones who chose my daughter for this.  I also thank our anonymous d<br/>\nonors!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, DO I HAVE YA WONDERING YET, LOL?<br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow afternoon (Saturday), she&#39;s living for Red Lodge, Montana near <br/>\nBillings, Montana (think Yellowstone, National Park).  While she&#39;ll get to visit <br/>\nYellowstone, her main reason for being there is to go on a REAL DINOSAUR DIG <br/>\n(LOL, Cheryl, & you didn&#39;t even realize this when you sent the e-mail today about <br/>\n&quot;never being on a REAL Dinosaur Dig).  All of this was made possible by an <br/>\nanonymous donor to the Museum Center, who donated ENOUGH MONEY to send 8 of the <br/>\nyouths from the youth program.  <br/>\n<br/>\n12 were asked to write 4 essays & 1 THANK YOU letter to the Anonymous Donor.  <br/>\n(The kids did have to be at least 16 to do this.)  They (Don and Arden) ONLY <br/>\nchose those who they thought would be best suited for the trip.  Of the 12, <br/>\nthey had to narrow it down (through the essays & thank you letter) to the 8 who <br/>\nare going.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is SOOOOO PSYCHED!  They fly out tomorrow afternoon!  ALL IS PAID <br/>\nFOR; FLIGHT, FOOD, LODGING, THE DIG, EVERY ASPECT!<br/>\n<br/>\nMe?  Well, LOL, I&#39;m so happy for her, but at the same time a bit freaked out <br/>\nby the fact that she&#39;ll be flying AGAIN w/out me (then, LOL, you DON&#39;T want to <br/>\nbe on a plane w/me, either...unless you have me heavily drugged).  Plus, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t like when she went to Washington, DC this past winter (though I was <br/>\nfreaked out about that too); at least I could have gotten there in under 12 hours <br/>\ndrive time, and who knows, an hour, maybe 1 1/2 tops by plane).  This is A LOT <br/>\nFARTHER away from me than DC!  But, I&#39;d never even try to stop her from this <br/>\ntrip.  This is a once in a life timer for most of us!  I&#39;d never be able to <br/>\nafford this trip, so she is one lucky kid, and a great essay writer!<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, WAIT:  OH YEA, THERE&#39;S MORE!<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of you know my daughter wanted to work at Paramount Kings Island <br/>\nAmusement Park (PKI) last year (she was only 15 then, and I told her I really wanted <br/>\nher to be a &quot;kid&quot; for one more summer; she listened and did).  She came to me <br/>\nin early spring, before PKI opened and asked me to take her to the park to <br/>\nfill out the application.  Beings that she WAS 16 by then AND it was the 2nd year <br/>\nin a row she asked, I knew she was serious.  (My one and only &quot;requirement&quot; <br/>\nwas that she had to stick w/it since it was just a seasonal job; that&#39;s our <br/>\nrule, you start something, you finish it.)  Well, she&#39;s absolutely LOVED the job <br/>\nand the job absolutely LOVES her!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll summer, they were giving her responsibilities above and beyond what they <br/>\ngive &quot;most&quot; associates; especially her age.  A few weekends ago, she was told <br/>\nby another supervisor, that the following day, they were going to put Kaycee <br/>\nwith one  Supervisors in Charge of one of the mid to large sized picnics (1000 <br/>\n- 2000 people).  She was required to pre train those who volunteer there, <br/>\n&quot;place people&quot; in positions she thought would suit them best, schedule breaks, <br/>\nlunches, & suppers, and write end of picnic reports (all the while, watching, <br/>\nsupervising, etc., & helping the workers).  She MUST HAVE DONE WELL!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the night, her supervisor (the MAIN ONE) HANDED HER an <br/>\napplication for a Forman position for next year (they&#39;d start training her this year). <br/>\n IT&#39;S REALLY GOOD NEWS when the Supervisor HANDS YOU that application.  <br/>\nAnyone who&#39;s been there once season can apply, but to have it handed to you, <br/>\nwithout going to the office yourself, says a lot!  And, I must say, PKI does pay <br/>\nwell.  She doesn&#39;t make minimum wage (but, I think it&#39;s good even when kids do <br/>\nmake Minimum wage; they still learn to work).  On top of the great pay (for a <br/>\nkid), she gets a free membership to the park, free food while working, 1/2 off <br/>\nfood when not, free tickets for friends, (I&#39;d say family, but we always buy <br/>\nseason passes, well except for my brother & his family).  PLUS, she gets a 40% <br/>\ndiscount on ALL PKI Merchandise.  She also gets other perks like discounts at <br/>\nother local amusements, like canoeing, dining out, etc.  They also have &quot;after <br/>\nhours PKI ASSOCIATES ONLY&quot; work parties where the supervisors run the rides, <br/>\nand they get to ride and eat all the junk food they can.  That lasted until 1 or <br/>\n2 am, late, but in a &quot;safe place.&quot;  I can&#39;t say they don&#39;t work those who <br/>\nwill hard.  They do, but it is GREAT practice for the future, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ll keep you posted on that one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do need to hit the bed, there are a few more things for us to do BEFORE she <br/>\nleaves early afternoon.  Please say your prayers for a safe return, and a <br/>\nfun, educational trip!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, LOL, THANKS for listening to me go on and on about my daughter, but, <br/>\ngeezsh, who just couldn&#39;t w/all this news?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care, & I&#39;ll keep ya&#39; all posted!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\nPS:  IF SOME OF YOU GOT DOUBLE.
