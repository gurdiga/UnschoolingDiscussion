The September <br/>\nafter she turned 8, I filed for her. Another dd has a birthday AFTER the <br/>\nSchool admittance deadline. (IE she must be 5 by Sept 1 to enter <br/>\nKindergarten)  Her birthday is the end of September, so would miss the 5yo <br/>\ndate - and, going by that logic, she would not be entering school until she <br/>\nwas actually near 9.  Does that make sense?  I am following the &quot;school <br/>\nlogic&quot; on this one, and so far it has served us well.
