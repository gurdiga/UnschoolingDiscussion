Hepatitis B is exceedingly difficult to contract and is contracted<br/>\nonly by unsafe lifestyle practices: IV drug use, unprotected sex or sex<br/>\nwith a partner you probably shouldn&#39;t be doing it with anyway.  It is<br/>\ncontracted much like AIDS.  Vaccinating newborns for this is nearly<br/>\ncriminal in my opinion.  We should educate our children instead of<br/>\nvaccinating them against such an easily preventable disease.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, children who suffer sexual abuse are at risk and don&#39;t have<br/>\nmuch of a say, unfortunately.  I think this factors into the decisions of<br/>\nwhich vaccines, when, and why, even though the risks don&#39;t apply to a lot of<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have vaccinated my children, except chicken pox, and now that I have done<br/>\nmore research I probably would not have had some of the other ones, either,<br/>\nand had partially vaccinated children.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my son has had to have numerous blood and platelet transfusions<br/>\nrecently, and while our blood supply  is screened, is it truly 100% safe?<br/>\nOf course not.  While I would forgo the Hep B shot if I had another child,<br/>\nin retrospect I&#39;m kind of glad he had it, just in case.  Now I&#39;m hoping he<br/>\navoids the chicken pox (whose vaccine is a vaccine in search of a disease),<br/>\nbecause he is at risk now for the complications.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of information out there.

If you nurse<br/>\nyour baby that is all the immunization it needs for at least the first<br/>\ntwo years anyway.<br/>\nThere is growing evidence that the growing rates of crib death can be<br/>\nattributed to vaccinations.  Vaccinations change babies&#39; breathing<br/>\npatterns for weeks after receiving a shot. In countries where<br/>\nvaccinations are delayed until 2 years of age (Sweden, Japan etc.), the<br/>\nrate of crib death has dropped to nearly nil.<br/>\nThe only documented cases of polio in North America in recent years have<br/>\nbeen from patients who have received the polio vaccine.<br/>\nI chose to vaccinate my first two children but as I read and learned<br/>\nmore I did not vaccinate baby #3.  My kids have been exposed to<br/>\neverything...whooping cough, you name it, and my 2 year old baby has<br/>\ndone just fine.  If you have a strong immune system these illnesses are<br/>\noften tough to catch (I exposed my children to chicken pox 3 times and<br/>\nthey still did not contract the illness), and even if you do get it they<br/>\nare not as threatening or &quot;deadly&quot; in developed countries with clean<br/>\nwater supply, good diet and proper sanitary conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to ask questions and do your own research.

I have been hearing a lot of mixed information on them and<br/>\nam<br/>\n&gt; beginning to think that all of the shots are not necessary for my<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n&gt; So, my question to you all is how many of you have made the decision to<br/>\n&gt; withhold certain shots and how has it affected your children?  I know that<br/>\n&gt; they cannot enter public school or daycare (which is obviously not a<br/>\nproblem)<br/>\n&gt;  but I have also heard that colleges will refuse entrance as well as<br/>\ncertain<br/>\n&gt; jobs (probably mostly govt., I am guessing).

When I was pregnant with dd (3)<br/>\nI read up on it alot cuz I was trying to the most<br/>\nnatural route with her birth and everything<br/>\nthereafter, and found out alot of things that led me<br/>\nto believe that yes, they do accomplish some good in<br/>\nsome kids and in some countries, but in my kids, who<br/>\naren&#39;t exposed to all the germs in school or daycare,<br/>\netc, in a fairly (bite my tongue) clean country, etc,<br/>\nthey would do more harm than good. dd hasn&#39;t had any<br/>\nshots ever in her life and is perfectly fine, other<br/>\nthan being a bit tempestuous at times. :) A good book<br/>\nthat talks about it a bit is &quot;Raising a Healthy Child<br/>\n- In Spite of Your Doctor&quot; by....hm... ?John?<br/>\nMendelsohn? I think. <br/>\nAlso if you go to Mothering.com they have alot of<br/>\nresources and articles about it, from both viewpoints,<br/>\nin what seems to be a very unbiased way. <br/>\nAnd depending on what state you live in, most of them,<br/>\nas far as I know just leave out the part of the law<br/>\nthat says &quot;...without certificate of exemption.&quot;<br/>\nas in you cannot enter school, etc, without signing a<br/>\npaper that says you as thier parent choose for them to<br/>\nbe exempt and the one I had to sign (to go in thier<br/>\nmedical records) had a place to check off if it was<br/>\nfor medical reasons, religious beliefs or personal<br/>\nbeliefs. How easy is that? I &quot;personally believe&quot; it<br/>\nisn&#39;t neccesary. A friend of mine gave none of her<br/>\nthree kids the shots and they went to school, but it<br/>\nwas just required that when there was an outbreak of<br/>\nanything at school, that they took thier work home for<br/>\nthe week, til it passed. Was very easy for her.<br/>\nThough I did have to fight with this one doctor who<br/>\nwas there cuz the kids regular doctor was out the day<br/>\nof dd checkup...he ranted and raved (and I do mean<br/>\nRANTED and RAVED and was very MAD) about how I was too<br/>\nyoung to know what I was talking about (I was 21 at<br/>\nthe time, and he was in his late 40&#39;s/early 50&#39;s) and<br/>\nI was harming my child and on and on and on and if I<br/>\nhad seen first hand a child die from complications of<br/>\nmeasles (both kids have since had measles and got thru<br/>\nit like it was a cold) and from polio etc, etc then I<br/>\nwould realize what a mistake I was making. It&#39;s<br/>\ndefinitely a tough decision --(becuz there is alot of<br/>\nfear put in you about the well-being of your child,<br/>\nand even about them DYING, and at times I was very<br/>\ntempted to just do it &quot;just to be safe&quot;, but otoh I<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel it IS safe) --and one that you may get a<br/>\nlot of grief from others about, but if you have a good<br/>\nsupport system and you&#39;re already used to getting<br/>\ngrief from people for unschooling and such then it&#39;s<br/>\nalot easier. :)<br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fmrduranie@...\">fmrduranie@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can&#39;t remember if I brought this to the list yet, or<br/>\n&gt; not, but, I am going to <br/>\n&gt; have our third baby in about five weeks and am<br/>\n&gt; considering my options on <br/>\n&gt; immunizations.
