The gal<br/>\nthat ran the front desk&#39;s daughter was hurt at school and she had to leave.<br/>\nI had run a switchboard back in the darkages, so I volunteered to fill in<br/>\nuntil they could call in the swing shift person.  Old habits die hard, so I<br/>\nused the chair to scoot back in forth in.  Ya know, 8 wheeled chair and you<br/>\npush off and slide from one side of the space to the other.  Well, seems the<br/>\nchair had been half-a** repaired and with one push off, two wheels fell off<br/>\nand I went over backwards striking my head on the switchboard console and<br/>\nthe side of my neck on the sharp formica edge of the counter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMild concussion and major headaches.  However, the headaches stayed way<br/>\nbeyond when the concussion was healed.  It seems if you bruise the spine and<br/>\nsurrounding muscles they somehow trigger headaches.  16 years later I still<br/>\nget the same headaches if I sleep wrong and put too much stress on those<br/>\nmuscles.  The doc explained that you do permanent damage to the &quot;wiring&quot; of<br/>\nyour nerves and that by pulling or pushing in a certain way you can again<br/>\nset off the headaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter bruised the spine and probably did some nerve damage.  While<br/>\nit takes awhile for everything to heal, she may still get the headaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think I told you about son #3&#39;s football injury (spinal) and hockey<br/>\ninjury (concussion).  The doc&#39;s explained that both of those injuries<br/>\ncreated a sort of whiplash and caused nerve damage.  He still gets headaches<br/>\nfrom those injuries and they occured 6 and 11 years ago respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 04, 2001 6:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Fibro, was:Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Holt and LD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Tia asked why/how the headaches went away:<br/>\n&gt; I have *no* idea.

(The majority of women get <br/>\nit during their perimenopausal years.)  It seems I&#39;ve read about other <br/>\nreasons, but I&#39;m tired and fogging.  My fibro came on quite gradually.  I <br/>\nstarted to get really tired a year or two after Lars was born.  I was <br/>\nfinally diagnosed hypothyroid and put on medication for that (after trying <br/>\nall kinds of natural methods to deal with it).  It helped, but I never did <br/>\nget back to &quot;normal&quot; in terms of energy.  I even went with a doctor who <br/>\nwould treat hypothyroid by the symptoms rather than the blood tests, but I <br/>\nstill had fatigue, even though he took my dose way too high.  (He even <br/>\nignored an obvious symptom of too much thyroid.  After that, I went back to <br/>\nmy regular doc.)  It was only after the pain gradually began that I started <br/>\npushing for another diagnosis.  I was really scared I might have rhuematoid <br/>\narthritis like my mother in law.
