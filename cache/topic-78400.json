This includes feminist groups, churches, lists, etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s hard to plunge into a new place, and that it&#39;s easy to feel like <br/>\nan outsider. Similarly, when you&#39;ve been around a place a while, it&#39;s easy to <br/>\nget caught up with people who have become friends, sometimes accidentally <br/>\nexcluding new people. New people in any group don&#39;t know the old stories or the <br/>\nold jokes or acroynms. <br/>\n<br/>\nI often feel like an outsider because some of the demographics of my life are <br/>\nvery different from others on this list. Probably everyone else feels that <br/>\nway too. Doesn&#39;t mean that I &gt;am&lt; an outsider, or that anyone here has ever <br/>\ntried in any way to exclude me. <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy, what I hear you saying is that some responses to people feel harsh. <br/>\nSometimes (but I think very rarely) that might be true. Remember...ain&#39;t no <br/>\nperfect people here. Mostly what I think really happens, though, is that <br/>\nparticularly people who&#39;ve been unschooling for a while feel VERY protective of it, and <br/>\nare very directive in their responses to people who question it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if not here, where? This list is for unschooling. For me, if someone came <br/>\nin and said &quot;We&#39;re unschooling except for math,&quot; but got it when we explained <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t work that way I&#39;d feel much more patient. We might be able to <br/>\npoint out all the learning their kids do and help them, if they wanted to, to <br/>\nbecome real unschoolers. If they didn&#39;t want to, but still were interested in <br/>\nhanging out to learn how to be a gentler parent, or how to support learning in <br/>\ngeneral, they&#39;d probably get a lot out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if they keep arguing that using math books is the only way, then <br/>\ncontinued to insist that they&#39;re still unschoolers, then people will get annoyed, and <br/>\nwill stop being patient. Intentions mean a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Nancy, I want to ask you: can you think of ways that we can make people <br/>\nwho are new who genuinely want to talk and learn about unschooling feel <br/>\nwelcome? Not by watering down the philosophy of the list, which is a given, but <br/>\nsomething else?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can always do better. But the point of the list has to be respected.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78776,"nextTopicId":78785}}
