Aside from dropping her wallet in a toilet at an Amtrak station (gag), she had a great trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Does she know/ and will call you if she feels like she is  in trouble?  Does she follow personal safety advice and practices?  Do you trust her instincts? Will she check in every week...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes to all this, too. I guess when I read your questions it helped me realize she&#39;s pretty well armed for the trip just based on who she is. It&#39;s still hard to watch your &quot;child&quot; march off &quot;unprotected&quot;, especially when, as I mentioned before, she needed SO much protecting when she was little. We parented in the attachment way back before we realized it had a name, and it certainly paid off.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If so, then I know she will have a great safe adventure.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love how you said &quot;I know&quot; rather than &quot;I think&quot;. &lt;G&gt; Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8789,"nextTopicId":8886}}
