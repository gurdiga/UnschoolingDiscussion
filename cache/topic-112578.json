It&#39;s out now, everyone is fine, but we had to stay at my  <br/>\naunts house last night, and probably will be staying in a hotel for a  <br/>\nwhile, dunno how long.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wondered why Pam hadn&#39;t responded to any of today&#39;s messages, but I  <br/>\nfigured she was just busy.  I realize this is off topic, but as Pam&#39;s  <br/>\na list owner, and some of you saw her last week at Legoland, and  <br/>\nMarty stayed at their house half of last week, I thought it worth  <br/>\nmentioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe garage is attached, with rooms on one side and to the back.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you were expecting e-mail from Pam... this could explain  <br/>\nthe wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  I can topicize it.  Isn&#39;t it good that they didn&#39;t to ask  <br/>\npermission to miss school today?  A couple of the girls do have  <br/>\nMonday classes, I think, but it&#39;s still not the same pressure as if  <br/>\nthey had to spend the whole day in class and get in trouble if they  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have their homework and all that.  I remember kids coming to  <br/>\nschool after all kinds of trauma, and just being there, distracted  <br/>\nand wounded and afraid.  It&#39;s SO much better for kids to get to be  <br/>\nwith their parents when there are problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112545,"nextTopicId":112585}}
