He doesn&#39;t go to Sunday<br/>\nschool, because it&#39;s just like that.  I spent a lot of time worrying about<br/>\nsome of those questions a couple months ago, and then I decided that he is<br/>\nwho he is, he&#39;s growing up to be a perfectly fine kid, and I&#39;m ok with who<br/>\nhe is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that unschooled kids ARE different than other kids, and we helped<br/>\nmake them that way, by choosing to unschool, so we shouldn&#39;t be vastly<br/>\nsurprised!  I also think that just like we have people we do and don&#39;t like,<br/>\nso do kids.  I can easily see where a giggly group of girls wouldn&#39;t be your<br/>\nson&#39;s style!  I disagree with the teacher, fail to see the problem and think<br/>\nthat your son is probably just fine as he is. (Although sitting in the<br/>\nclassroom once, just to be sure, might not be a bad idea),<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have concerns about a child who couldn&#39;t make any friends, couldn&#39;t<br/>\nplay in any group, or work with other kids on anything.  There would be real<br/>\nissues there.  But that&#39;s not how you describe you son.  He has friends,<br/>\ngroups, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to also disagree with the teacher that he needs to have do things he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to do, and have to go along with a group.  People design theirv<br/>\nlives based on their own needs.  Some people specifically choose jobs where<br/>\nthey don&#39;t work with other people, and most people try to do things they are<br/>\ninterested in, so they aren&#39;t stuck doing things they don&#39;t want to.  On the<br/>\nother hand, your son isn&#39;t going to be 9 forever, either!  He will grow and<br/>\nchange a lot before he ever gets to choosing a job or profession.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it depends on how many waves you&#39;re willing to make, but in the<br/>\nend, this is about what you believe vs. what the teacher believes.  You<br/>\ncould challenge the teacher and his &quot;supervisor&quot;, if your Sunday school has<br/>\none, or just let it pass.  I doubt that you&#39;ll change his mind, though,<br/>\neither way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39066,"nextTopicId":39063}}
