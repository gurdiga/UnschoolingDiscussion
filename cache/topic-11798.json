We just feel <br/>\ncomfortable enough finding our own resources that we don&#39;t worry about a (or <br/>\nwhich) text book and don&#39;t feel the need to ask others for verification of <br/>\nour decisions!<br/>\n<br/>\nI use textbook for math (Saxon).  It&#39;s not stressful for us.  We don&#39;t use it <br/>\nat the prescribed pace.  We might ignore it for a while and then do a bunch.  <br/>\nI use it to help me explore/explain math and science concepts ds will see <br/>\nonce he gets to college.  The math textbook is often a jumping off place for <br/>\nother subjects, just like anything else we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I use a math textbook?  Because I want to be confident we&#39;ll cover <br/>\nthis material.  Many times we get to a concept and ds already understands it <br/>\nquite nicely.  That is great!  Those lessons we skim over and I let him tell <br/>\nme what the point is.  Then move on to the next.  We might go through several <br/>\nlessons in this fashion.  No problem.  It is great confidence builder for <br/>\nboth of us.  DS recognizes he has been learning something and I&#39;ve just <br/>\naccomplished an &#39;assessment&#39; of his progress pretty painlessly.  This helps <br/>\nme have no hesitation to the nosey mother when she asks how ds is <br/>\ndoing...after all, we are constantly assessing him and I can respond that his <br/>\nlatest &#39;assessment&#39; shows marked improvement!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving ds explain the concept to me is always great way to see inside this <br/>\nkid&#39;s head and figure out how he&#39;s thinking.  I generally learn something <br/>\nfrom him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 2 offspring...can&#39;t call them both boys since one is 22, married and a <br/>\ndaddy!  The other boy is 11.  I used to think that using a text for language <br/>\narts/english was important.  Especially things like spelling.  I&#39;ve decided <br/>\nthe heck with that!  Now ds asks about a word he needs to spell, I ask him <br/>\nhow he thinks it&#39;s spelled and help him correct any error.  He sees that his <br/>\nspelling is improving dramatically and is gaining confidence that he can <br/>\nspell/write well enough to communicate whatever he wants.  (isn&#39;t that the <br/>\nwhole goal/reason to learn to write/spell?  To communicate something?)  He <br/>\nreads a LOT and I&#39;m certain that the process of reading reinforces <br/>\ngrammar/spelling concepts without any extra effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpelling and grammar were pretty hard for me to let go.  But I look at DH <br/>\n(and many others) with high school graduation, military tech school, a bach <br/>\nof science degree and  he can&#39;t spell worth beans and has me edit any formal <br/>\ncorrespondence he is sending out.  Whereas I have no degrees and dropped out <br/>\nof school at 17 (boredom and ready to get on with life).  Once I realized <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve done okay with myself, I felt much better about not formally <br/>\naddressing many subjects.  I still feel the need for reference points from <br/>\nmath.  It may even be my need rather than my son&#39;s need.  But, it certainly <br/>\nis not hurting him any!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSure there are lots of other things that he picks on his own.  But, I figure <br/>\nit&#39;s my responsibility to introduce some things in his life.  IMO, it&#39;s on a <br/>\nlevel similar to teaching him to brush his teeth or wash his hands after <br/>\nusing the bathroom.  Those are not things he&#39;s likely to learn with no input <br/>\nfrom his parents, and it&#39;s my responsibility to help him learn those good <br/>\nhabits.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a question:  Is using a computer program really any different than <br/>\nusing a textbook or classroom?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll go first...yes and no.  I use them and ds and I both love them.  There <br/>\nis no resistance, he&#39;s playing a game.  He recognizes it&#39;s a &#39;school&#39; game, <br/>\nbut it doesn&#39;t put him off any.  He learns the material at a rapid pace in a <br/>\nfun manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH there is less interaction between the two of us when he&#39;s using the <br/>\n&#39;puter to learn something.  I like the interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I use computer programs/games (or piano lessons, for that matter) <br/>\nare pretty similar.  I want to be confident that the subject is presented to <br/>\nds in a way that encourages him to learn something that I think is important <br/>\nfor him to have in his life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t use them (computer programs, textbooks, tutors, classes, etc.,) <br/>\nexclusively, by any means!  They are launching places.  More like supplements <br/>\nto the rest of our lives.  Something we do in between exploring other parts <br/>\nof our world.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11778,"nextTopicId":11803}}
