Perhaps it is our hard water or that <br/>\nI should try the powder instead of the gel. I wonder if there is something <br/>\n(like vinegar or baking soda) that would boost the cleaning power of their <br/>\nsoap for hard water? I read that a company called Bio-Kleen has a good <br/>\ndishwasher soap. Otherwise we do use the Seventh Generation toilet paper <br/>\nand unbleached paper towels. When we recently switched to the brown paper <br/>\ntowels, my son said that his grandmother (my mom) would think the paper <br/>\ntowels were dirty! LOL  My mother is a white paper, Lysol and bleach <br/>\nfanatic. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s going to change after 65 years. BTW, She <br/>\nhasn&#39;t seen the brown paper towels yet!    :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHealthy New Years,<br/>\nOlivia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: Fri, 29 Dec 2000 20:32:07 -0800<br/>\n&gt;We use &quot;Seventh Generation&quot; automatic Dishwashing detergent.
