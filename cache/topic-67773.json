They were created for<br/>\n&gt; windows 95. Do win 95 things work w/win ME? because, when we try to<br/>\n&gt; load Reader Rabbit for win 95 to our computer (with ME) we have<br/>\n&gt; troubles.

Kid&#39;s software is notoriously buggy and<br/>\ncompatability problems abound. They are heavily video-intensive so video<br/>\ndriver conflicts and screen resolution conflicts can also cause problems.<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had a problem with the Magic Schoolbus software, I&#39;ve run it on<br/>\nWin98, WinME and WinXP. Then again, the Magic Schoolbus stuff was done by<br/>\nMicrosoft, so maybe it&#39;s a bit more likely to be compatible. We did huge<br/>\namounts of system and video driver compatability testing when I worked there<br/>\non the CD-ROMs, so I know what a big nightmare it is for manufacturers of<br/>\nthese types of programs. It&#39;s a cost issue too. If you&#39;re a small game<br/>\nmanufacturer, it&#39;s harder to afford to set up a huge compatability lab with<br/>\nall sorts of computers, monitors, video cards, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is if your kids use the computer alot is to either give them<br/>\nan old computer when you upgrade or go buy them an old computer. The price<br/>\nfor a one or two year old computer is incredibly low because upgrades have<br/>\nhappened so fast that stuff is outdated quickly. But that doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>\ncan&#39;t run a lot of stuff. My kids are using my 5 year old computer running<br/>\nWin 98. Once they&#39;re older and they get into more video intensive games, I<br/>\nwill probably need to upgrade them, but right now with the stuff they&#39;re<br/>\ninto, it works fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"Tim and Maureen","from":"Tim and Maureen &lt;tmthomas@...&gt;","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: kids computer games","postDate":"1052289229","msgId":67891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDgwMWMzMTQ2MiQ5ZWZkZjVhMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwNTA2MTY1MjI4LjYxMTM1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwMDAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67866,"nextInTopic":67917,"prevInTime":67890,"nextInTime":67892,"topicId":67773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
