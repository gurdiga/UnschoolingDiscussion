This is Skyra from hs-ca.  I just joined Unschooling-dotcom a<br/>\ncouple of days ago, but after watching/listening for the last 2 days, wonder<br/>\nif I really want to be there at all!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that list always so aggressive/sarcastic/antagonistic???  Or is there<br/>\nactually some good information shared once and awhile?  Perhaps I am just<br/>\nspoiled with being on hs-ca!!!   LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI almost wrote a post to U.com but decided that it would probably be<br/>\nresponded to in the same disrespectful manner that seems so prevelant there<br/>\nat the moment!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I am only asking because I am trying to decide whether to stay or<br/>\nunsub.  It is such a high volume list, and if it is always so full of<br/>\nbickering, I can&#39;t be bothered!!!  I came to hs-ca at the peak of a conflict<br/>\nas well, and am thrilled to have stayed....I wonder if this would be the<br/>\ncase with this list as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n(please excuse the choppiness of this...as I am sick as a dog with the flu!!<br/>\n:(  )<br/>\n<br/>\nSkyra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5374,"nextTopicId":28297}}
