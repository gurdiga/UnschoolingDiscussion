They <br/>\nhad it !!! <br/>\nWe didn&#39;t run to the movies for this one but I keep a list of <br/>\nthings I do want to see so I have an idea of what I want when I go <br/>\nshopping @ the library :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to say I don&#39;t ever go to the movies - the other day my <br/>\nson said on a whim that he wanted to go to the movies.  So we did - <br/>\nand we saw the movie Brother Bear.  I loved it and as always it <br/>\nbrought tears to my eyes.
