I can see I really need to talk to some<br/>\nbreeders.<br/>\n You are right...we got him at a pet shop. we were told they were no<br/>\ndifferent than breeders just less expensive.hmmmm!  I can see that we<br/>\nwill want to pay for quality.<br/>\n  Now I feel kind of bad knowing that if we got him a friend it might<br/>\nhave helped. Oh well...next time I will go to a breeder. We are in TN. I<br/>\nwill need to serf the net awhile and see if there is anyone. Everyone is<br/>\ntoo far to get their extras.*grin* but I am sure we will make out.<br/>\n  Do any breeders ship? and is it an arm and a leg? what price might we<br/>\nbe talking for two rats? I don&#39;t know the different breeds so I can&#39;t say<br/>\nI am particular. I go more for the personality......I guess except when I<br/>\ngo to the pet store huh?

There <br/>\nare many sites. Look around &#39;til you find the one you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used the shelving you can find at Lowe&#39;s or Home Depot. It&#39;s not &quot;wire&quot; <br/>\nexactly, but it&#39;s often used in closets, mostly white---I don&#39;t think I saw <br/>\nany colors. You must cut ut with a handsaw, or maybe a dremel would work. The <br/>\nshelves are 6&#39; long. We cut them in half. Do all your measuring in the store! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI got one of those under-the-bed storage boxes for the base---throw the top <br/>\naway. Make sure the shelving fits side-by-side and in the corners of the <br/>\nbase. <br/>\n<br/>\nFour 6&#39; shelves will make two double sides (Length), two single sides <br/>\n(Width), and a top with a lip that measures 32&quot; X 16&quot; X 35&quot; (they overlap in <br/>\nthe corners) with one extra piece that can be cut up and used for ramps and <br/>\nperches if you&#39;re clever and handy (we didn&#39;t!&lt;G&gt;). We attached everything <br/>\nwith some neat fasteners from the hardware department. The lid is attached <br/>\nwith those plastic things men love to connect stuff with (I don&#39;t know what <br/>\nthey&#39;re called: you thread one end into the other which has a hole, and pull <br/>\ntight?)). You can add &quot;stories&quot; by attaching more shelving. We also have a <br/>\nrope and a hammock. Some families cut doors into the sides for easy access; <br/>\nwe just lift the top and they scurry up.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47743,"nextTopicId":47747}}
