You couldn&#39;t pay me to watch<br/>\nprofessional baseball, but I love watching my son&#39;s team.  He seems to need<br/>\nthat same mix of moving and working outside interspersed with TV and<br/>\ncomputer.  He paid for his bikes by working for his dad too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he has also taught me a lot about trusting.  I haven&#39;t succeeded in<br/>\ntrusting him all through his growing up, but I&#39;m getting better at it all<br/>\nthe time.

He is unlike his siblings in that they both (at now 16dd<br/>\nNell & 19ds Sky) get involved in things I find interesting . . . languages,<br/>\ndrama, reading, writing, etc. Bay wants and needs to be moving and working<br/>\noutside and when he is not, he is likely to be wanting computer or TV. Now<br/>\nI view this as a healthy balance, but it took me a while to get there<br/>\n(another story on a parent deschooling in a different way!) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Bay, quite on his own, discovered the wild, noisy, exciting world<br/>\nof dirtbiking. And, over the course of time, decided that he wanted to do<br/>\nthis more than anything. He started to express interest in owning his own<br/>\nbike. Now, dirtbikes are expensive and I could not plop down $2000+ for one<br/>\nfor him, nor did I want another line of credit. Did Bay let this stand in<br/>\nhis way? Nope. He started saving his money - from his mowing jobs here on<br/>\nour farm and our neighbors place. When that was not enough, he got his dad<br/>\nto hire him to work on the house his dad was building for himself. Lo and<br/>\nbehold, it took Bay over a year to save up and buy his very own shiny,<br/>\nspiffy new red 100cc dirtbike. Now, along the way in this process I had<br/>\nchoices . . . I could rain on his parade and say that it was too expensive,<br/>\ntoo dangerous, I wasn&#39;t taking him to the track, too noisy to ride here,<br/>\nblahblahblah. But, I did not. I saw the light in his eyes. I saw him devour<br/>\ndirtbike magazines when we would go to Borders. I saw his enthusiasm. It<br/>\nwas a very beautiful thing. People ask me how I could support this - it&#39;s<br/>\ndangerous, it&#39;s so noisy and dirty there, how can I stand to go - etc. I<br/>\ncan only answer that in a million years it isn&#39;t where I thought I would be<br/>\nat 53 years old . . . spending my Saturday or Sunday at the dirtbike track<br/>\nwatching my 12 year old zoom at excessive speeds around a track, jumping<br/>\nwith wild abandon. Nor did I think that I would be called from the gardens<br/>\nwhile planting vegetable starts to crawl under the dirtbike and help him<br/>\nfind the gasoline line to drain the tank, or hold wrenches for him while he<br/>\ntightens spokes. For me, helping Sky edit a mythical fantasy story he is<br/>\nwriting or helping Nell learn her lines for her latest dramatic endeavors -<br/>\nthat was &#39;easy&#39;. This adventure with Bay has been a stretch for me. And,<br/>\nyou know what? - it is good for me to stretch. This young man has taught me<br/>\nmore about unschooling than anyone on the planet. . . and more about<br/>\ntrusting than anyone, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAloha, Lee<br/>\n<br/>\nNORTH COUNTRY FARMS<br/>\nAn Organic Family Farm & Tropical B&B Cottages<br/>\nAn Eco-Tourism Destination<br/>\nP.O.
