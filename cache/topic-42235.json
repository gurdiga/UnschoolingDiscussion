While <br/>\nthis isn&#39;t necessarily bad, it does open doors for inquiry that aren&#39;t part <br/>\nof the law. Here in Kansas, I fill out a (one time) statement of intent. <br/>\n(there is no official homeschooling in Kansas, we register as nonaccredited <br/>\nprivate schools) They ask for the *name* of the school. I could have put <br/>\n*unschoolers* and risked needless questions. Instead, I put Meadowlark <br/>\nSchool. Simple, easy and no one bothers me. &lt;g&gt; If you need help interpreting <br/>\nyour specific law, ask! There are many here who can direct you to local <br/>\nsupport groups. And there are others, like me who enjoy reading and <br/>\ninterpreting law. My point is too much information can be just that, too <br/>\nmuch! <br/>\n~Nancy <br/>\n<br/>\nPS. I strongly feel that a period of cooling off from school would greatly <br/>\nhelp both your boys. Give them time to relax, let them play and just be for <br/>\nsome time. Your kids won&#39;t *fall behind* as it is just them. There is no one <br/>\nto fall behind from.
