I&#39;ve been <br/>\non other lists that weren&#39;t even a quarter as active as this one.  I want you <br/>\nknow that over the last few days reading all your posts - I sense a certain <br/>\n&#39;freedom&#39; here and I like it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI take a snip of Sarah&#39;s post because I could relate to her experience.  When <br/>\nmy kids were more restricted to tv, they wanted it all the more.  It drove me <br/>\nnuts!  Now, (mostly, except for my six yos) it&#39;s no big deal...  A little <br/>\nreverse psychology in action.  It&#39;s working.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, our family lives in MA, USA.  We have six children ages 12, 9, 6, 4, <br/>\n2.5, and 6 mos.  We have always home schooled.  Our modes and methods have <br/>\nchanged over the years but our overall mission remains the same.  That is, to <br/>\nbe out of the systems and to be &#39;free&#39; as God should lead us.  It&#39;s been <br/>\nquite a trip!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n~ Lisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30747,"nextTopicId":30767}}
