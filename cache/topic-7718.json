I have one that \n  I know from personal experience, where the 3 kids have turned out variously \n  illiterate, totally lacking in self esteem, a bully and a thief. Their mother \n  was into John Holt and unschooling from the time the eldest was a baby. \n  <p>But you see it&#39;s all a matter of definition, and IMO she didn&#39;t understand \n  what unschooling was all about. For example, when her daughter wanted to \n  attend a gym class instead of just the play-around-with-the-equipment session, \n  because she wanted to learn how to do things properly, she was told no. When \n  one wanted to learn to read it was told no. And so on. This woman thought \n  unschooling was taking your kids to lots of places, having lots of toys, \n  books, etc - offering an enriched environment - but NEVER teaching them \n  anything, because teaching is the root of all evil. And to her, responding to \n  a child asking &#39;what does this word say?&#39;, was teaching, so she wouldn&#39;t do \n  it. IMO this was neglect, not unschooling. \n  <p>In my experience, some kids thrive on structure - I have one like that. I \n  am trying to help him find his own ways of structuring his life. He loves \n  workbooks - discovered them through another homeschooler and begged for them \n  for his birthday! He likes to have a schedule printed up of all our \n  commitments, so he can work out times to do his maths, music practise etc. My \n  husband taught him to use MS Projects or some such thing so he could timetable \n  his day! But this isn&#39;t forcing anything on him, it&#39;s enabling him to live how \n  he likes, within a disorganised family &lt;g&gt; Others thrive on serendipity, \n  and going with the flow. \n  <p>On a more subtle level, and this is the level I&#39;m still at :-(&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  if you don&#39;t believe in unschooling in your gut and in your head and in your \n  whole being you will run into some problems.

If \n  you can&#39;t trust totally, then I think that the next best thing is to be honest \n  with your kids about what is happening - at the same time as striving towards \n  fixing up your own head!

They know when they are being watched and even evaluated (even <br/>\nif we&#39;re only doing it subconsciously).  If we don&#39;t trust them it just won&#39;t <br/>\nwork.  It seems to be the hardest thing for us to do.  Isn&#39;t it sad that the <br/>\nbiggest, most long-lasting lesson so many of us learned in school is that <br/>\n&quot;Children Are Not To Be Trusted&quot;.  That one goes along with &quot;Give Them An <br/>\nInch And They&#39;ll Take A Mile&quot;.  It is engrained in us.  Our culture says it&#39;s <br/>\nokay for adults to have choices, but not kids.  Why is that?  I admit to some <br/>\nguilt in this - it&#39;s okay if I choose to have more cookies than are good for <br/>\nme with my morning coffee, but I don&#39;t let the kids make the same choice.  I <br/>\nguess we have some responsibility to shelter them by guiding their choices.  <br/>\nI KNOW how many cookies it takes to give me a stomachache ( a LOT!  LOL) but <br/>\nthe kids don&#39;t.  Where do we draw the line between completely trusting them <br/>\nand protecting them because we&#39;re the parents?  It&#39;s a tough call.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** KiM ***<br/>\nruns with scissors</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"HPaulson5@aol.com","from":"HPaulson5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4uJ5LUMawm-5Yb_mWNC1r-MAHP8gugturK6HotI1lQnliOyQzvoFhRtoQ3dLj_ViauVAtZn4Ig4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New to the list","postDate":"954880681","msgId":7723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEyLjI5NjFmNjYuMjYxYmFjYTlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7718,"nextInTopic":7725,"prevInTime":7722,"nextInTime":7724,"topicId":7718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Carol, Your post on unschooling is excellent!

You put &quot;unschooling&quot; into <br/>\nwords so easy for others to understand.  I felt a sense of confirmation that <br/>\nwhat we are doing is right, as every once in a while, I need to hear it.  <br/>\nThanks!
