The person posting the complaint simply forgot what she&#39;d <br/>\nput in as her userid and was trying to use the wrong one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, sometimes technical problems DO happen and I&#39;m sure some <br/>\nwill happen to us at some time. I hope people will understand that the <br/>\nmessage boards, like this list, are a cooperative project of a group of <br/>\nunschooling moms and that we&#39;re doing this as a public service, not <br/>\nbeing paid.  Even creating the message boards was quite a challenge, <br/>\nnone of us had ever done it before and had to learn a lot to accomplish <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, support our efforts by joining the message boards and <br/>\nparticipating. As great as this list is, message boards have some real <br/>\nadvantages over lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of all messages coming into your mailbox, in the order posted, <br/>\nthey are all nice and organized for you, by topic. Since all posts on a <br/>\ntopic are together, it makes for far more coherent reading. The message <br/>\nboards are also far more easily searchable (have you tried to use the <br/>\nsearch function in yahoogroups to find some old post from this list?).  <br/>\nYou can go back and edit your own posts, after you&#39;ve posted them. You <br/>\ncan start your own topics.  You can even &quot;subscribe&quot; to be notified <br/>\nwhen there are new posts on the message boards, either any posts at <br/>\nall, or posts in particular topics of your choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - come and join us at &lt;www.unschooling.info/forum&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":178172004,"authorName":"LadyWolf/Teresa","from":"&quot;LadyWolf/Teresa&quot; &lt;ladywolf55@...&gt;","profile":"ladywolf1955","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Fw: Since this list is not meant for politics...","postDate":"1099570916","msgId":100942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBNRUxMSkVPSk1JSUVQQkVPSUlQT0VOTUNQQUEubGFkeXdvbGY1NUB3dGsub3JnPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ1MUFBN0EwLTJFMkQtMTFEOS05QjhBLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100940,"nextInTopic":100944,"prevInTime":100941,"nextInTime":100943,"topicId":100933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry, Pam, I was not in a good mood yesterday, and had a severe headache to go with it.
