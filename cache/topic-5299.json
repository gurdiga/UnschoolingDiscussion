Since a full moon on the winter solstice occurs in conjunction with<br/>\na lunar perigee (point in the moon&#39;s orbit that is closest to Earth), the<br/>\nmoon will appear about 14% larger than it does at apogee (the point in it&#39;s<br/>\nelliptical orbit that is farthest from the Earth).<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the Earth is also several million miles closer to the sun at this time<br/>\nof the year than in the summer, sunlight striking the moon is about 7%<br/>\nstronger making it brighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, this will be the closest perigee of the Moon of the year since the<br/>\nmoon&#39;s orbit is constantly deforming. If the weather is clear and there is a<br/>\nsnow cover where you live, it is believed that even car headlights will be<br/>\nsuperfluous.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn December 21st. 1866 the Lakota Sioux took advantage of this combination<br/>\nof occurrences and staged a devastating retaliatory ambush on soldiers in<br/>\nthe Wyoming Territory.<br/>\n<br/>\n ::::::::In laymen&#39;s terms it will be a super bright full moon, much more<br/>\nthan the usual AND it hasn&#39;t happened this way for 133 years!&lt;&lt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5414,"nextTopicId":5402}}
