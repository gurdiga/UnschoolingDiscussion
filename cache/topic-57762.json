He really doesn&#39;t lay in a <br/>\nsling anymore...when he is in it he is upright, either on my hip or facing me <br/>\nsleeping on my chest or facing out as I watch tv or work on the computer.  <br/>\nBut that is getting to be a challenge since now he wants to type with mommy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have wanted to try another type of sling though because right now I am <br/>\nusing the NoJo which I love but it has no tail to help with nursing.

It&#39;s not like your mooning<br/>\nsomeone or flipping them off. even if your whole boob<br/>\nis out, the baby&#39;s head covers it from view. Unless<br/>\nsomeone is being really nosy, they won&#39;t see much<br/>\nmore.The only reason I feel it may be percieved as<br/>\nrude is that it is no longer common in our culture.<br/>\nWhen/if it becomes a mainsteam practice once again, I<br/>\ndoubt it will be considered rude. Bottle feeding in<br/>\npublic certainly isn&#39;t rude.People who find it<br/>\noffensive have the power to turn their eyes somewhere<br/>\nelse.If you are feeling uncomfortable nursing an older<br/>\nbaby in public,that&#39;s a differrent story. If your<br/>\nchild is not nursing just for nutrion alone and is<br/>\nolder, you can always just tell them to wait,or that<br/>\nyou will nurse them in the car or at home.
