It&#39;s caled   _The Speed of Dark_ by Elizabeth Moon.  It&#39;s<br/>\nabout a man in the future that&#39;s high-functioning autustic.  They develop a<br/>\nexperimental &quot;cure&quot; for autism and he has to decide if he wants to stay the<br/>\nway he is, or change himself to be &quot;normal&quot;.  One of the things I liked most<br/>\nabout the book was getting into his mind and how it works.  The author&#39;s son<br/>\nis autistic, so I think it&#39;s probably a good representation of autism, at<br/>\nleast as good as it can be by an outside source.  The book gave me some new<br/>\ninsights into certain behaviors my &quot;out of sync&quot; child exhibits.  I think a<br/>\nfew friends of mine are going to have a discussion of the book.
