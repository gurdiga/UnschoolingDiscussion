My 22 yod lives about ten miles","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-999860831\">Suzanne,<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though two of my kids are married and the third is away at college, so<br/>\nfar no one has gone &quot;really far away.&quot;  My 22 yod lives about ten miles from<br/>\nus.  My 24 yos was away at college (4 hour drive) for one year, then came<br/>\nback home.  When he got married he lived 20 miles, then 50 miles, and, as of<br/>\nlast April, now 200 miles away.  What is neat is that he is going to grad<br/>\nschool in the same town his 20yos is at college, so even tho she is in a<br/>\ndorm, they are there for each other.  And she will get to play with the baby<br/>\na lot more than I will when it comes (due in Feb.).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my kids are close, and there is great excitement when one of the big<br/>\nones calls or comes home.  The 20yo just went back to school yesterday.  We<br/>\nalready miss her!  But I think it helps that the 3 boys have each other to<br/>\nplay with ( and fight with) so at least they don&#39;t feel alone.  Also, even<br/>\nthough their big brother is far (we see him about every 2 months or more)<br/>\nthey like their BIL just about as much.  He plays with them and they model<br/>\nafter him (wear caps the same way, etc.).  They see him every 1-2 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all stay in touch, but are also very independent.  We&#39;ve never called or<br/>\nvisited daily like some families.  When the two got married, we wanted to<br/>\ngive them their space.  We only go over to visit when invited, no drop ins.<br/>\nBoth my DIL and my dd have told me they appreciate that.  The other mothers<br/>\nare a bit different - there more often, not always invited, and not always<br/>\nappreciated when they just &quot;stop by.&quot;  But if any of us needs anything - to<br/>\ntalk, money, a favor, whatever - we&#39;re all there for each other and we all<br/>\nknow it.  The younger boys see that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long will son #1 be gone?  That might make a difference in how they feel<br/>\nabout it.  Will he be able to come home for visits, like on holidays?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen mine have just gone on trips (2-3weeks) they have always sent<br/>\npostcards, brought back souvenirs, and called and talked with everyone.<br/>\nMaybe your family can do things to try and *be* together - like have same<br/>\nmeals, try out some of the customs, share as much as you can long-distance.<br/>\nAlso, let son #2 express his feelings, then do constructive things to try to<br/>\nfeel better - write, e-mail, make a gift, anything that connects him with<br/>\nhis brother (watch *their* favorite movie, play a game, etc.).  These are<br/>\nsome of the things we did when the baby died - we let the boys play with the<br/>\nbaby&#39;s toys, gave them their own framed and wallet pictures of Joel, let<br/>\nthem buy him things.  This lasted for about the first year, then tapered<br/>\noff.  If your son has strong feelings of loss, there are books that will<br/>\ngive more ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, help them enjoy their time together now!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54418,"nextTopicId":54336}}
