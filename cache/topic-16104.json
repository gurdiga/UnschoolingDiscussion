There are tactful ways to take part in <br/>\nopposing discussions. Your posts that I have read often come off as <br/>\nblunt, rude, or down right condecending.  Or another option is  just <br/>\nnot take part! Just because you happen to have an opinion on <br/>\nEVERYTHING does not mean you always have to share. I kept my opinions <br/>\non AP parenting to myself when that was going on.  I am not a fan of <br/>\nit myself, but I am not going to step in and come down on someone <br/>\nthat really believes in it.  Just because it is NOT FOR MY FAMILY <br/>\ndoes not make it wrong or evil for someone elses. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this is beside the point.  The fact of the matter still <br/>\nremains that in the opinion of some  you were totally in the <br/>\nwrong and dishonest about what you did with Christina.   And since <br/>\nhonesty is of the utmost importance for you, I thought I should share <br/>\nthat.  And since you INSISTED it all be done on the list, that is <br/>\nwhat I have done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a good evening, <br/>\n<br/>\nSandi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"louisaem@cs.com","from":"louisaem@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"54kLEfxnroAJ9nVBCFAAbkugDtTS3MpjLl3CB3y7zlIOvcfv1OQq-oHS9sKY6WKA5EohBrCQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] There are lies and there are lies, was guns","postDate":"981768079","msgId":16183,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVkLjcwOGE3OWIuMjdiNWYxOGZAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16182,"nextInTopic":16184,"prevInTime":16182,"nextInTime":16184,"topicId":16104,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-736826087\">&lt;&lt; To have my awareness, honest and motherhood questioned in public should <br/>\nhurt <br/>\n me, and twenty years ago would have, but now I&#39;m used to it.

I&#39;ve already said that in my own set of <br/>\npriorities truth is #1.  Others have other priorities.  I was talking all <br/>\nalong here about what I would do.  For some people it&#39;s guns, or choice, or <br/>\nbeing a good Christian, or a Republican, or a Pagan, or having kids who win <br/>\ncontests or clean their rooms or whatever.  Everybody has their top five <br/>\n(ten, whatever) sacred obligations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo again, for explaining and defending what I believe, people are insulting <br/>\nme very directly and personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one&#39;s truth is no more than opinion, that&#39;s what discussions are made <br/>\nof.  When a person makes a statement she knows to be false, she judges <br/>\nherself and others judge who know of it.  It kinda depends who you want to <br/>\nplease and what you believe about what God knows and cares about, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of preventing a rape or harboring Jews in WWII, those are BIG <br/>\nexceptions which are justifiable.   Some here considered the presence of a <br/>\ngun to be a similar life and death situation.  I didn&#39;t.  That doesn&#39;t make <br/>\nme a criminal.  That makes me a person who believes that teaching children to <br/>\nlie is worse than having children see/touch guns.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people feel that strongly about sending their kids to school, or <br/>\nvaccinating, or feel that strongly that natural childbirth is stupid and <br/>\nbreastfeeding is disgusting and all KINDS of things.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Honesty is not always about truth telling.

Personally, <br/>\nin *MY* opinion, the way that you, Sandra, handled things with Christina <br/>\nover her personal email to you was VERY, VERY dishonest.  You might not <br/>\nhave flat out lied about anything, but you were dishonest in your handling <br/>\nof the situation none the less.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that email had bothered you that badly, you should have brought it to <br/>\nthe list right away, or at least to the moderators.  But instead, you kept <br/>\nit, THOUGHT you saw an opportunity to use it against her, and forwarded a <br/>\nPERSONAL email to a list of over 450 people. Not because it bothered you, <br/>\nbut because YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD CAUGHT HER IN A LIE.   THEN, when you <br/>\n*should* have realized you were wrong, you instead made a big deal about <br/>\npeople sending personal emails off the list, which was NOT what the issue <br/>\nwas about even!!  You jumped on the chance to embarrass someone and prove <br/>\nthem wrong, and that is worse than any little white lie a child has ever told.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, a personal email should remain that way, PERSONAL.  On just <br/>\nabout every list I have ever been on in the six years I have been using the <br/>\ninternet, the policy has always been to take personal emails OFF the list. <br/>\nOn my own list we often request that people take PERSONAL thing to PERSONAL <br/>\nemails, so that the rest of us do not have to be in it.  Most of the time <br/>\npeople have enough sense to do it on their own. Christina did not threaten <br/>\nyou, and though her email may have been rude and possibly off the mark, it <br/>\nwas still made in *private*.  If I were to come to you with a private <br/>\nproblem and asked you for help, would you forward THAT to the list as <br/>\nwell?  You know, when Chris said that she could not access the vaccine info <br/>\npage, I emailed her OFF LIST and told her I would get the info she needed <br/>\nfor her.  We then emailed each other a few times, should we make those <br/>\nemails public too?    Does everyone out there wish to be bored with every <br/>\nlittle personal exchange?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, you waited until you THOUGHT she was trying to pull something over <br/>\non the group (ie lying about her identity) which, if you had read the <br/>\nemail, she was not.  Whereas I do not agree with Chris&#39;s position on the <br/>\ntopic of abortion, I did not see her post, using the name Tina instead of <br/>\nher own, as dishonest.  I could have easily done the same thing in my own <br/>\npost.  It is a way to make an anecdotal story MORE dramatic. People use <br/>\nthat tactic often, there is nothing at all dishonest about the technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you get all high and mighty and decide you are going to put this girl <br/>\nin her place!  You call her on her so called bluff, only to realize that <br/>\nYOU WERE IN THE WRONG (which maybe you never realized seeing as that you <br/>\nare never wrong).  But, instead of being honest and admitting this mistake, <br/>\nyou turn it into some thing about not sending private emails, when that was <br/>\nnot even what the issue was about.  You thought you had caught this person <br/>\nthat pissed you off in some kind of lie, but you had not.  And instead of <br/>\nsaying OOPS, which would have been the HONEST thing to do, it turned into <br/>\nsome whole other monster.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you can justify this out and rationalize it any way you wish IN YOUR <br/>\nMIND, but the fact remains, that there are plenty of us out here, on this <br/>\nlist, that found your sending that email when you did and your further <br/>\nreaction to it to be totally dishonest.  So are you wrong because some of <br/>\nus feel that you are wrong and dishonest, or are you totally ok because <br/>\n*you* feel rationalized in what you did?  And if you do feel that you were <br/>\nin the right with what you did in regards to that email, isn&#39;t the child <br/>\nthat tells a white lie to get out of a bad situation just as right? In <br/>\ncertain grey areas, doesn&#39;t the truth become just a little more subjective <br/>\nthan a clear cut case of right or wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nHonesty is not always about truth telling.  It is also how you handle <br/>\nsituations and info.  If I tell you a secret in confidence, and then I piss <br/>\nyou off, do you have the right to go and tell that secret?  Do I tell my <br/>\nfriend with the ugly baby and PPD that her kid is uglier than my dog?  Do I <br/>\ntell my landlord that the second cat (which was my daughters bday gift) he <br/>\nsees really is ours when I know he will make us get rid of it?  Do I tell <br/>\nmy sister when she ask, every little thing her kid has done wrong while she <br/>\nwas out with her husband for their anniversary date?  Do I tell you that <br/>\nyou really do come off as a snotty, holier than thou, Ms Know-It-All over <br/>\nemail?<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the truth is nothing more than our OPINIONS, and more times than <br/>\nnot, they really should be kept to ourselves anyway.  Opinions are <br/>\nsubjective, and therefore, so can be the truth.  Marrying a *friend* so he <br/>\ncould retain custody of his siblings might not have been an HONEST thing to <br/>\ndo, and to many it might have even been a LIE, but it was probably the <br/>\nRIGHT thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no blanket policy of truth.

Nobody&#39;s proven it yet, and <br/>\nI&#39;m 47.  If it makes you feel better about your own practices and theories to <br/>\nbelieve strongly that it&#39;s not possible, then you&#39;re doing something with <br/>\nyourself, and not to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at this point in the discussion it does seem pretty personal.  Like this, <br/>\nfor example:  -=-Gee, how soon we forget!  Either that or you have no kids. <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-And what an adult may get away with and what a child will encounter or two<br/>\nseperate animals.__<br/>\n<br/>\nThen perhaps it is my children&#39;s luxury of never having been to school, and <br/>\nhanging out with families either they have chosen or we their parents have <br/>\nchosen because of philosophical similarities (La Leche League, Society for <br/>\nCreative Anachronism, homeschooling), or intelligence or SOMETHING somehow <br/>\nselective, and my kids&#39; self confidence or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one boy they hang around with who has gotten Marty in minor trouble <br/>\na couple of times.  Once the police stopped and talked to them because they <br/>\nwere out walking around at night and had made too much noise.  But right in <br/>\nfront of the other kid I told Marty (and so him along with it) that Marty <br/>\nneeded to agree with or veto all actions, and he couldn&#39;t blame kidx, and <br/>\nthat kidx needed to NOT push Marty, or he wasn&#39;t coming over anymore.  But <br/>\nthey came right in reporting that the police had talked to them and told them <br/>\nto &quot;run home&quot; (from  half a mile and some) and that the policeman was going <br/>\nto come and talk to me and they better be home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe lied.  And that half mile was too far and too dangerous to run, in the <br/>\ndark, next to a major road.  And I tried hard not to say &quot;Well he lied,&quot; but <br/>\nI really did not appreciate a law officer lying to my son.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish he HAD come and talked to me and to them.  It would have been more <br/>\neffective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut they&#39;ve not yet since been in trouble and they hang around much in groups <br/>\nof four or six and the other kids would tell me or hint if those two had been <br/>\ndifficult.  They&#39;re 12 and 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not only the three children I have now (9, 12, 14), but had custody of <br/>\nmy accidental half-brother for a few years, in the early/mid 1980&#39;s (a <br/>\nhabitual liar, fetal alcohol syndrome, raised in very sad situation, which is <br/>\nwhy my mother relinquished parental rights.  And that was after I had married <br/>\na friend in 1975 because his parents both died in very short time and his 10 <br/>\nand 12 year old siblings were going to be taken away (a long story).  With <br/>\nthem, lying was not common, but was done sneakily to &quot;keep peace,&quot; but it <br/>\nonly kept peace for that moment, until the truth was found out and there were <br/>\nten units of work/talk to make up for that one unit of peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving grown up carefully honest, this confirmed my theories.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have known one another since 1977, and I know of no lies <br/>\nwhich have passed between us.  Is it genetic?  Are we naturally brave and <br/>\nconfident?  That could be, as there seem some people who are naturally timid <br/>\nand easily led.  Maybe what we believe is training and values passed down is <br/>\nmore genetic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo have my awareness, honest and motherhood questioned in public should hurt <br/>\nme, and twenty years ago would have, but now I&#39;m used to it.
