And","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1405453323\">Wellllll, I don&#39;t think anyone needs automatic weapons or handguns.  It is<br/>\ninteresting that folk who own guns are 22% more likely to injuried with a<br/>\ngun.  And folks that have guns for &quot;protection&quot; are 75% more likely to be<br/>\ninjured by their own gun than by the supposed bad guys they are protecting<br/>\nthemselves from.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the problems with guns is that we don&#39;t enforce the laws we have AND<br/>\nwe don&#39;t put rules on the books that will make a difference.  Folks who sell<br/>\nguns illegally get a slap on the wrist, so why should they care if they are<br/>\nproviding guns to gang members and bad guys.  The number of illegal guns<br/>\ncoming over the borders is enormous!  Deal with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND, I won&#39;t shout but really want to, what about IDIOT police departments<br/>\nthat take the guns they have confiscated and then turn around and sell them!<br/>\nSome of those guns have been traced through 3 or 4 criminal acts after being<br/>\nsold by police departments!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the real origin of lots of guns used by the bad guys is the same folks<br/>\nthat bought them to protect themselves and then they were stolen.  Folks<br/>\ndon&#39;t do enough to keep guns safe and that includes safe from theft.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Russ Anderson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anderclan@...\">anderclan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, February 07, 2001 4:21 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Guns - People with Rage<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;  Guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people; rage kills people. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, but if people with rage can&#39;t get guns they can&#39;t kill with them.<br/>\nIt<br/>\n&gt; takes a lot more energy to kill some other. more physical way. -Amalia-&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But where do these people with rage get their guns?
