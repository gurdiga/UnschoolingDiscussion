She had her own apartment at school and had &quot;been on her own&quot; for <br/>\nfour years.  Breaks were spent at home for the most part or some part anyway.  <br/>\nShe did take summer school course for a couple summers so she was away a large <br/>\nportion of that time too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer college was out of State, so I don&#39;t know if that makes any difference.  <br/>\nAt one point she had thought of settling down in her college town, but a <br/>\nbroken heart and a low paying job brought her home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI welcomed her home with open arms, glad to have her back around the house.  <br/>\nWe nursed the broken heart and celebrated the &quot;healing&quot; of it as time passed.  <br/>\nShe did work, she did contribute to the household, but she also drove my car <br/>\nthat we paid for and the insurance that we paid (same as college).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I asked her to pick up something for dinner she did, very willingly.  If <br/>\none of her siblings needed something, she helped out, often times even buying <br/>\ntheir clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad, ever the one who can&#39;t wait for an &quot;empty nest&quot; (claims he wants to <br/>\nbe able to chase me around the house naked, uh, yeah...) would ask her too <br/>\noften too suit me, when she was moving out.<br/>\n<br/>\nRents are very high here and she was substitute teaching looking for a <br/>\npermanent position, waitressing at night.  Sometimes a big week, sometimes not.  <br/>\nSchools here also pay only once a month, that takes some getting used to and <br/>\nlearning to budget to be able to make it thirty days between paydays.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did move out, less than a year after she came home.  It saddened me that <br/>\nshe left home, although not as bad as when I dropped her off at college (she <br/>\nis about three miles from me).  I know she wanted me to be excited and help her <br/>\nfind furniture and curtains and paint and decorate her new apartment but I <br/>\nwas a foot dragger in that dept.  I didn&#39;t like the guy she was dating (he was <br/>\nphysically abusive) and I didn&#39;t want to feel like I contributed to her being <br/>\nable to be abused out on her own out of site.  I even feared he might kill her. <br/>\n So I hated that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward to her being rid of abusive boyfriend, him finally out of her <br/>\nlife and in prison where he belongs and I AM happy for her and DO enjoy helping <br/>\nher decorate and I do buy her things for her apartment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while I often doubted I was a very good mother at letting my children <br/>\n&quot;go&quot;, I found out there were reasons for that and good ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould I feel like a failure if she were living at home?  I don&#39;t think so, I <br/>\nenjoy my children so very much, but I know it makes them proud to be on their <br/>\nown, paying their own bills and doing things on their own.  Not many of my <br/>\ndaughters friends live alone without roommates, heck most do still live at home, <br/>\nall with college degrees or about to have them.  I think she likes that she&#39;s <br/>\nable to do something others see as a goal somewhere in the future but without <br/>\nany distinct time frame in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see her every single day, well there are times when she goes to visit <br/>\nfriends or whatever that I don&#39;t see her every day but if she&#39;s home, she comes by, <br/>\nusually for dinner and I very much enjoy her.  I guess the feeling is mutual <br/>\nor she wouldn&#39;t be here so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son moved out at 18 because his girlfriend said he should or she <br/>\nwould leave him.  She&#39;d been out of school longer and her mother wanted her OUT <br/>\nASAP.  So while he&#39;s been on his own longer, he didn&#39;t go to college but <br/>\nstraight into a fifty hour or more work week.  He needs much more help from us with <br/>\nmoney, etc., even though he makes more than my daughter.  I think her being <br/>\n&quot;on her own&quot; at college but with a budget from us helped her learn that if she <br/>\nwants to pay the electric, then maybe that little outfit from the Gap will have <br/>\nto wait.  She came home until she was ready to leave, he left sort of against <br/>\nhis better judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had time to ease into adulthood and all the huge responsibilities that go <br/>\nwith it.  It was thrust upon him.  He knew he could come back home at any <br/>\ntime (still can) but he&#39;s manly pride wouldn&#39;t let him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience it&#39;s much better for them to stay home with a loving family <br/>\nlonger than shorter and learn life&#39;s lessons before you find yourself on the <br/>\nstreets so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might be wrong in thinking this but I enjoy the fact that my children <br/>\nCHOOSE to be around me.  I see so many kids in and out my door that will do <br/>\nANYTHING to avoid their parents and never do anything with them.  I think that&#39;s sad <br/>\nthat a child would grow up and look for ways to see their parents as little as <br/>\npossible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it normal to be on your own at a young age?  I was married at 17 but I <br/>\nfelt old already from so many life experiences and it was a relief to leave them <br/>\nbehind.  I&#39;m glad my children don&#39;t have to run from their home to find love <br/>\nor validation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if there were living here at thirty-five, I might respond entirely <br/>\ndifferently, especially if it was because they didn&#39;t know how to be responsible <br/>\nfor themselves or their families.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] rite of passage and adulthood was Re graduations","postDate":"1053716896","msgId":70521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0ODMwMWMzMjE1ZSRiNmQxZWZjMCQwNTAwMDAwYUBtYWJiLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDExOS4yM2U4Njk3MS4yYmZmYzIzZEBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70515,"nextInTopic":70525,"prevInTime":70520,"nextInTime":70522,"topicId":70511,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... unrealistic ...

But not some stiff ceremonial thing.  I <br/>\ndunno.  Everyone&#39;s posts about puberty has made me think yet again about it.  <br/>\nSomething to help them accept the stage of development and the changes of their <br/>\nbodies seems vitally important. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I do think that graduation can be a teenager to adult rite of passage ( <br/>\n*singing* school&#39;s out for summer, school&#39;s out forever!) , but we can screw <br/>\nthat up quite a bit by sending them off to college right afterwards.  *sigh* I <br/>\ndunno, the accomplishments are commonplace, therefore not as useful as <br/>\nindividuals?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been thinking about maturity, when is a child an adult, and society <br/>\nseems to be constantly pushing it back.  Read an article the other day that <br/>\npsychologists are exploring the idea of a post-adolescent, pre-adult stage of <br/>\ndevelopment, that can continue into the 30&#39;s!!!  Ya know, those people who <br/>\nwork, but still live at home, those who can afford to buy nice cars and clothes, <br/>\nbut somehow can&#39;t afford rent or a mortgage or their own food? <br/>\n<br/>\n The two women interviewed for the article say that because they aren&#39;t <br/>\nmarried, don&#39;t have kids, or haven&#39;t bought a house, they don&#39;t consider themselves <br/>\nadults.  I think some kind of rite of passage is becoming necessary, and that <br/>\ngraduations aren&#39;t doing it anymore, not from high school, and not from <br/>\ncollege, either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething bothers me about parents who don&#39;t think anything&#39;s wrong with <br/>\ntheir kids  coming home to live after college.
