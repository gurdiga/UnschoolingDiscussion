He&#39;s always been a huge challenge for me.  He&#39;s in first grade <br/>\nright now after unschooling before that & after this year he&#39;ll be home <br/>\nagain.  I was trying to give him something all his own hoping I&#39;d see <br/>\nimprovement in his behavior.  Behavior is no better from it but it&#39;s opened <br/>\nso many doors in his mind that I only hope I can find ways to fill.  There&#39;s <br/>\nmore I want to say but since I&#39;m overwhelmed & hormonal I&#39;ll skip the verbal <br/>\ndiarrhea.  My point is that suggestions & support for unschooling my <br/>\nchallenging boy is exactly what I am looking for on these lists, along with <br/>\njuggling 3 kids when I&#39;m chained to a breast pump.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nSara<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32313,"nextTopicId":32319}}
