For my short lived career I worked with <br/>\npreschool accredidation and such.  However, in college we had a class <br/>\nthat touched on each &quot;subject&quot;, how to teach math, reading, language <br/>\narts, etc.  One class for special needs, ONE!  All those disorders in <br/>\none short semester with maybe 10-20 hours visitation in schools.  <br/>\nSpecial needs meaning gifted to extremely mentally retarded.  Yeah, I <br/>\nam sure I absorbed all that to be a great help to my future students. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were no classes in learning styles.  I rememeber hearing it, I <br/>\nam sure I read it.  In no way, not in one class, not in one <br/>\ninterneship did we ever discuss how to cover all the diverse learning <br/>\nstyles. We never had to come up with one lesson plan that could cover <br/>\neven half.  It was part of the rhetoric in your history of education <br/>\nand that was that.  Certainly, school has done a slightly better job <br/>\nof including some of the different learning styles in the primary <br/>\ngrades (if you have the right teacher &lt;I am rolling my eyes here, <br/>\nbecause you know what the chances are&gt;)  Certainly, primary grades <br/>\nwere more slightly fun than I had, with learning centers and such <br/>\nalthough it gets worse the older you get.  However, I would like to <br/>\nglimpse at this particular teacher&#39;s lesson plans and see her using <br/>\nall the styles &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I mention I plan to homeschool (most people I speak to would <br/>\nnot know the difference between unschool and homeschool) they tell me <br/>\nhow *easy* it will be for me as I am a teacher.  They are just set on <br/>\nthis.  It is difficult for anyone I know to think they can do this <br/>\nsimply because I have a degree which says I am a teacher.  You know <br/>\nwhat, maybe I am a little more aware of some questions to ask or <br/>\nwhere resources are or some good children&#39;s literature than a brand <br/>\nnew PARENT.  Maybe, I had a little less research to read in some <br/>\nareas.  Who knows.   But beyond that, it is of little help.  In fact, <br/>\nit just mean more deschooling for me &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for those of you who ever feel that maybe some teacher out there <br/>\ncould do it better or provide more diverse experiences or use all <br/>\nthose varying learning styles, let me set the record straight.  NO <br/>\nWAY!  They were not trained to do it, it is as simple as that.  And <br/>\nif you have a special needs child than there is not even need for a <br/>\ndiscussion!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mina@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;One of the most provocative claims that she made was that she had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;training&quot; to teach to different learning styles while us <br/>\n </span></blockquote>homeschooling<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;moms don&#39;t.

Let me quote it: &quot; Unschooling allows free<br/>\nuse of any and all bits of information, not just school&#39;s small set. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if this is true, than it should be reasonable to use school&#39;s set so long<br/>\nas it is helpful and not restrictive.  So long as you don&#39;t put the learning<br/>\nin a box, but apply it to real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s what I was doing.

If teachers are set <br/>\non read the chapter and answer the questions, and education professors can <br/>\nconvince them some kids don&#39;t learn well that way, maybe those teachers will <br/>\nthrow in some songs and games and something to touch and smell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming that unschooling families have never deprived any child of the <br/>\nfreedom and opportunity to use all their senses, to move or to sit, to talk <br/>\nto themselves while they work or to look out the window, to work in short <br/>\nbursts or to sit at one project for four hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF those opportunities are all present, it doesn&#39;t matter if a parent knows <br/>\nwhat his child&#39;s learning style might be deemed to be by a professional <br/>\neducator.  They&#39;ll learn more than one way anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68379,"nextTopicId":68268}}
