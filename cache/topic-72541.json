Everyone was <br/>\ndownstairs playing and watching tv, and trash and dishes and clothes <br/>\nwere everywhere. So i got up mad and put the knee of the bad ankle on <br/>\nthe seat of my computer chair, and scooted all over picking stuff up <br/>\nand cleaning. I was so mad that no one was taking initiative when mom <br/>\nwas down. I was mad that I even had to ask, so I didn&#39;t. Dh came up <br/>\nand got mad at me for not asking.

I&#39;m married to someone who likes clean but<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t at all see mess, clutter, piles and what have you. He&#39;ll actually<br/>\nstep over stuff instead of picking it up. I knew that when I married him and<br/>\nhe knew I was a nut about organization but still married me anyway too. He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hassle me about being anal and I don&#39;t hassle him about his clutter<br/>\nof &quot;stuff.&quot; He has places where he can do as he pleases and I do too. Out of<br/>\nrespect to me in how I feel, he tries (he really does!) to organize things<br/>\nin the family living space. Aside from that, I do it all. He has his things<br/>\nto do around here and at the office all day and I have my things that I do<br/>\nbest. I don&#39;t nag at him to make things neat when he could care less. Why<br/>\nshould I?? So take everything I said and just apply kids to it too. I didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave them to be little maids and I knew darn well that kids make clutter.<br/>\nIt, for the most part, isn&#39;t important to them so why should I try and<br/>\n&quot;make&quot; it be important?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certain parts of the house that I ask to be kept a certain way.<br/>\nThat&#39;s for me. The kids don&#39;t play in the living room. When they do, they<br/>\nknow to take everything back out with them and put it away. Usually the only<br/>\nthings that end up in there are hula hoops, jump ropes, balls, etc. Once in<br/>\nawhile they are left there and I just put them away. Most of the time, the<br/>\nkids do it. The playroom is theirs and so are their bedrooms. When someone<br/>\nis coming over to play with them for the day, they try and neaten (is that a<br/>\nword?) things up a bit. Sometimes when their rooms get overwhelming, I&#39;ll go<br/>\nand clean up or ask them if they want help or just want to do it themselves.<br/>\nThe dining room table of lately looks like it&#39;s going to walk away. Unless<br/>\nI&#39;m having company for dinner, I let that go. If I want to sit at a table, I<br/>\ncan do that in the kitchen. Joseph is our big artist and really needs his<br/>\nspace. Most times his computer desk is way too small for his projects.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in awhile the floor of the playroom is scattered with small things that<br/>\nI can&#39;t vacuum around or push. I&#39;ll ask for some help in cleaning it up, and<br/>\n9 chances out of 10, I get that help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll 4 kids were parented the same way with this and my 17 year old is very<br/>\nconsiderate and also very neat and clean herself. The 7 and 8 year olds have<br/>\ntheir moments and the 2 year old is a walking tornado!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I ask them not to do, and see to it is that they don&#39;t eat in<br/>\ntheir bedrooms. Takes only one crumb to bring ants. The playroom has the<br/>\ngames and TV and they can eat in there with no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t have chores or help with anything that is done around the<br/>\nhouse like cleaning the yard and things unless they ask to help. They put<br/>\ntheir dirty clothes in a basket and when laundry is done, I will ask them to<br/>\nput away their folded clothes. They hang up towels after their showers and<br/>\nthat&#39;s about the only things I ask for. I know this was very long but I hope<br/>\nit helps you somewhat understand what we do here. As far as commitments that<br/>\naffect the children I&#39;m not sure what you mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10110095,"authorName":"Mattydill@aol.com","from":"Mattydill@...","profile":"momofpickle2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Children&#39;s participation in family responsibilities","postDate":"1054928960","msgId":72616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE1LjNhZjZiZmE0LjJjMTI0YTQwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72612,"nextInTopic":72642,"prevInTime":72615,"nextInTime":72617,"topicId":72541,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/6/03 3:38:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time, genant2@aol.com ...

If it is something we &quot;have&quot; to do, can&#39;t get out of, and they <br/>\nreally don&#39;t want to do it we try to compromise, maybe we can go and stay for a <br/>\nshort time, or dad can go and I will stay home or we can go and then do <br/>\nsomething that they do want to do after. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the cleaning, whoever feels that any place is dirty beyond their <br/>\ncomfort level cleans.  Usually I will be the first as I am usually the first one <br/>\nuncomfortable.  But if the boys see me cleaning the living room they may join in <br/>\nand help.  I try not to disturb things they are working on etc.  Sometimes I <br/>\nwill hear Dallen say &quot;I can&#39;t find a place to set up my LEGOs&quot; and he will <br/>\nstart cleaning, I will join in and help until it is clean enough for him.  I do <br/>\npick up here and there so it isn&#39;t a total disaster and the boys are pretty <br/>\ngood about picking things up when they are done, may be a week or two before they <br/>\nare done but they don&#39;t want them lost or broken.  I feel if I want the house <br/>\na certain way it is my decision to keep it that way or reevaluate my <br/>\nexpectations.  And I have reevaluated many times.
