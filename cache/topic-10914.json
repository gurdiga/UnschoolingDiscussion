I would feel somewhat violated if people could access totally personal \nfeelingsa such as these , on a search engine...after all this is somewhat of a \nsupport group, and in these type sof groups it is in the spirit of the groups to \nassume soem degree of confidentiality.&nbsp; wouldn&#39;t you think?&nbsp; Not that \nit matters what someone might think that reads this, but it is rather \npersonal..I should be able to choose to whom, I &#39;d like to share it \nwith.</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10911,"nextTopicId":10916}}
