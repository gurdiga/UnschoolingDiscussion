Then again just knowing there are other unschoolers is helping me.  My 9 yo son is also very anti school structure and has been since the start.  His little brother, 5, has caught on.  I tried to school at home but from the beginning could not come to terms with &quot;teaching&quot; spelling, science, PE, and social sciences.  The rest started falling by the wayside bit by bit.  Math was the last to go and now I only want to do enough to make us look schooly to the powers that be.  That only consist of 3-4 written items and some math problems on paper.  I figure that will meet the &quot;samples&quot; requirement of our state unless they just do things on their own that I can copy.  I don&#39;t want to push too much, but I also don&#39;t want flak from the county schoolies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried to hook up with some Catholic Homeschoolers but found out quick that their study program took a full week to keep up with and most were reluctant to add anything to their schedule.  Hope they enjoy it, we have a life.<br/>\n<br/>\nambersand</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19399,"nextTopicId":19403}}
