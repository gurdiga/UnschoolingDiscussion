It took everything she had just to get out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bed, she was in so much pain. By March 2002, she had undergone<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;biopsies, and was on 24 various prescription medications. The<br/>\n </span></blockquote>doctors<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;could not figure out what was wrong with her. She was in so much<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pain, and so sick, she knew she was dying. She put her house, bank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;accounts, life insurance etc. in her oldest daughters name, and made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sure her younger children were to be with her oldest daughter. She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wanted her last hooray, so she planned a trip to FL (basically in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wheelchair) for March 22nd.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;On March 19th I called her to ask her how one of her tests went, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;she said they didn&#39;t find anything on the test, but they believe she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;had MS. I thought, oh, my....then I recalled an article a friend of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;mine emailed to me...and I asked her....Do you drink Diet pop? She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;told me yes, as a matter of fact she was getting ready to crack one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;open that moment, I told her not to open it, and stop drinking the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;diet pop....and I emailed her the following article. She called me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;within 32 hours after our phone conversation and told me she stopped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;drinking the diet pop, and she can walk...she went up the stairs,!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the muscle spasms went away. She said she didn&#39;t feel 100% but sure<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;felt a lot better. She told me she was going to her doctors with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;article and would call me back when she got home. She called me, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;her doctor was amazed, he is going to call all of his MS patients to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;find out if they consumed artificial sweetener. In a nutshell, she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;was being poisoned by the aspartame in the diet soda, dying a slow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;death.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;When she got to FL March 22nd, all she had to take was one pill, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that was a pill for poisoning....she is well on her way to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;recovery.....and she is walking!!!!! No wheelchair!!!! This article<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;saved her life!!!! Here is that life saving article:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If it says &quot;SUGAR FREE,&quot; on the label, DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT! I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;CONFERENCE on &quot;ASPARTAME&quot; marketed as &#39;NutraSweet&#39;, &#39;Equal&#39;, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&#39;Spoonful&#39;. In the keynote address by the EPA, it was announced that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in the United States in 2001 there is an epidemic of multiple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sclerosis and systemic lupus, that it was hard to understand what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;toxin was causing this to be rampant. I stood up and said that I was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there to lecture on exactly that subject.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I will explain why Aspartame is so dangerous: When the temperature<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;this sweetener exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol in ASPARTAME<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;converts to Eformaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;causes metabolic acidosis. (Formic aci! d is the poison found in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sting of fire ants.) The methanol toxicity mimics among other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;conditions multiple sclerosis. People were being diagnosed with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;having multiple sclerosis in error. The multiple sclerosis is not a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;death sentence, whereas methanol toxicity is! Systemic lupus has<br/>\n </span></blockquote>become<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis,especially with Diet Coke<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Diet Pepsi drinkers. The victim usually does not know that the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;aspartame is the culprit. He or she continues its use, aggravating<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the lupus to such a degree that it may become life-threatening. We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have seen patients with systemic lupus become asymptomatic once<br/>\n </span></blockquote>taken off diet sodas.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;In the case of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reality, the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;disappear. We&#39;ve seen many cases where vision returned and hearing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;improved markedly. This also applies to cases of tinnitus.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;During a lecture I said &quot;If you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;spasms, shooting pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss-you probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have ASPARTAME DISEASE!&quot; People were jumping up during the lecture<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;saying, &quot;I&#39;ve got some of these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;symptoms: Is it reversible?&quot; Yes! Not drinking diet sodas and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>keeping an eye out for aspartame on food labels, yes!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;! ; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have a very serious problem. A stranger came up to Dr. Espisto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(one of my speakers) and me and said: &quot;Could you tell me why so many<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people seem to be coming down with MS?&quot; During a visit to a hospice,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a nurse said that six of her friends, who were heavy Diet Coke<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi etc. IS NOT A DIET PRODUCT! The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Congressional Record states that it makes you crave carbohydrates<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;will make you FAT. The formaldehyde stores in the fat cells,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;particularly in the hips and thighs. Once off these products with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;significant increase in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;exercise, etc., Dr. Roberts in his lecture stated that he had<br/>\n </span></blockquote>patients who lost an average of 19 pounds over a trial period.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Aspartame is especially dangerous for diabetics. We found that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;physicians would believe that they have a patient with retinopathy,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;when in fact the symptoms are caused by aspartame. The aspartame<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;drives the blood sugar out of control. Thus diabetics may suffer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;acute memory loss due to the fact that aspartic acid and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;phenylalanine are neurotoxic without the other amino acids found in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;protein. Thus it passes the blood brain barrier and deteriorates the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;neurons of the brain, causing in diabetics (as well as in patients<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not suffering from diabetes) various kinds of brain damage,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>seizures,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;depression, manic depression, panic attacks, rage, violence. (The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Aspartame in thousands of pallets of diet Coke ! and diet Pepsi<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consumed by men and women fighting in the Gulf War, may be partially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to blame for the well-known Gulf War Syndrome.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Dr. Roberts warns that it can cause birth defects i.e. mental<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;retardation if taken at the time of conception and early pregnancy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Children are especially at risk for neurological disorders and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>should<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;NOT be given NutraSweet.

Unfortunately it is not always easy to convince a mother<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that aspartame is to blame for her child&#39;s illness. Only by trial<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;success will she be able to warn other mothers to take their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;children&#39;s health in their own hands.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Stevia, a sweet herb, NOT A MANUFACTURED ADDITIVE, which helps in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;metabolism of sugar (which would be ideal for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;diabetics) has now been approved as a dietary supplement by the FDA.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For years the FDA has outlawed this sweet food because of their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;loyalty to MONSANTO.
