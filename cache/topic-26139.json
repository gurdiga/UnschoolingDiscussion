Ds loves to cook. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Beware:  All crockpots are different.  I never give definite times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBarbeque Beef or Pork<br/>\nGet three or four pounds of roast.  Cut it into chunks and throw it in<br/>\nthe crockpot with a bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce.  Add a little bit<br/>\nof water (1/4 of a bottle while I rinse the bottle is what I do.)  Turn<br/>\non High if you want it in 4 or 5 hours or low for all day.  When cooked<br/>\nthrough and the pieces are falling apart, pull them out of the liquid and<br/>\npull them apart on a plate.  Discard any fatty or grisly bits and throw<br/>\nit back into the sauce.  Stir well.  Serve on buns or over toast.<br/>\n<br/>\nItalian Sausage Sandwiches<br/>\nPour one can of diced tomatoes into crock.  Add enough sausages till<br/>\nabout  2/3&#39;s full.  Cover that with slices of onion and red and green<br/>\npeppers.  Add another can of tomatoes and enough water to almost cover<br/>\nthe veggies.  Cook for several hours WITHOUT PEEKING!  Lifting the lid<br/>\nmesses with this one.  After three or four hours stir the veggies into<br/>\nthe juice if needed and finish cooking.  Serve with Hoagie rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nPork and Sauerkraut<br/>\nThree pound pork roast OR three pounds of western style ribs, two or<br/>\nthree pounds of Kraut, a sprinkling of caraway seeds if you like.  Dump<br/>\nall in and cook.  Serve with mashed potatoes.  (I make Bisquik dumplings<br/>\nnow that I have a pot that stays hot enough to do it.  My old one<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t keep the temp high enough with the lid off.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nFUN THINGS TO DO WITH FROZEN BREAD DOUGH!!!!  <br/>\n(or bread machine dough)<br/>\nWARNING - all cooking times are approximate.<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Make pizza.<br/>\n2.  Monkey Bread - thaw bread and cut each loaf in to 32 pieces.  Roll<br/>\neach piece in melted butter then in cinnamon sugar.  Drop into greased<br/>\nBundt pan or Angel Cake pan.  Drizzle top with a little extra butter and<br/>\nsugar.  Let rise.  Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes - check frequently -<br/>\nyour time may vary.  Turn onto a plate immediately but wait to remove the<br/>\npan.  Let the goo drip down for a while first!<br/>\n3. Pepperoni Rolls - thaw bread.  Cut each loaf into 12 pieces.  Flatten<br/>\neach piece, top with a slice of sandwich pepperoni or salami and roll<br/>\njelly roll style.  Seal the seams.  Let rise (pinch any seams that pop). <br/>\nBake at 350 for 20 minutes or so.  Optional - add slice of provolne or<br/>\nmozzarella with the meat.<br/>\n4.  Chopped Bread - Thaw bread.  Flatten loaf slightly and throw in some<br/>\nstuff (cheese, pepperoni, veggies, spices, whatever)  With a LARGE knife<br/>\nstart hacking at it.  When it is all a big pile of blocks of stuff, pile<br/>\nit about 1&quot; high on a greased cookie sheet and bake at 350 till done<br/>\n5.  Cinnamon Rolls - Thaw bread, roll one loaf out as thin as you can. <br/>\nSpread thickly with butter and sprinkle on cinnamon and sugar (I like<br/>\nbrown sugar but your choice).  Roll as tightly as you can.  Slice about<br/>\n2&quot; thick and place in greased pan.  (I make lots at a time but you need<br/>\nto choose a pan that just fits the rolls you are making.  One loaf is<br/>\nabout a 9x9 pan for me I think.  Let rise and bake at 350 for about 30<br/>\nminutes.  Turn onto a plate immediately but wait to remove the pan.  Let<br/>\nthe goo drip down for a while first!  Frost if you want but we don&#39;t.  <br/>\nOptional - sprinkle pecans into the pan before placing the rolls in, or<br/>\nsprinkle pecans on with the sugar and roll them in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND ONE LAST RECIPE - Feel free to think up a name for these!<br/>\nBTW - these look really gross bet they are delicious!<br/>\n<br/>\n2 lbs chip chop ham (Isaly&#39;s if you can get it) ground up or chopped fine<br/>\n1 lb shredded cheese (cheddar or swiss or whatever)<br/>\n1 med onion chopped very fine<br/>\n9 hard boiled eggs shredded<br/>\nmayonaise (the real kind)<br/>\nyellow mustard<br/>\n30 or so hot dog buns<br/>\nAluminum foil<br/>\n<br/>\nMix the first four ingredients.  Add enough mayo and mustard to bind.<br/>\n(you can adjust till you like the mustardy-ness - I like lots!)  Spoon<br/>\ninto hot dog buns.  Wrap each sandwich with foil (shiny side in) and<br/>\nfreeze till needed.  To eat - put frozen sandwich in toaster oven or oven<br/>\nand bake at 325 for at least 1/2 hour - until center is warm.<br/>\nIf you wish to eat them the day you are making them, you can just line<br/>\nthem up in a baking pan and cover the pan with foil - no need to wrap<br/>\neach one.  Baking times vary.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~ ~&#92;/~<br/>\nThink like a man of action, act like a man of thought<br/>\n<br/>\n                     - Henri Bergson</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26165,"nextTopicId":26179}}
