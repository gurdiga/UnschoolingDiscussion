We got Mathquest with <br/>\nAladdin by Disney a couple days ago, and my 7yo boy really seems to enjoy <br/>\nit. It&#39;s giving him good practice in adding and subtracting and has a lot of <br/>\nlittle logic games. Nice calm music too.<br/>\n<br/>\nChumbo.com was out of stock on many of the titles that interested me, <br/>\nthough. Several of the titles were by a publisher called Broderbund, but <br/>\nwhen I tried to get to their web site, I was directed to Mattel instead. I <br/>\nsuppose there&#39;s been a buyout or something. Even there many of the title <br/>\nwere out of stock.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has any other good sources for educational CD-roms, I&#39;d be <br/>\ninterested!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11059,"nextTopicId":11045}}
