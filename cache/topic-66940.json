This is where I learned <br/>\nhow to read music and do scales. I NEVER practiced during this time. <br/>\nWell, I didn&#39;t practice my scales or things like that. But I <br/>\nmemorized, and made it completely and fully my own, the opening <br/>\nmeasures of Mozart&#39;s Piano Sonata(?) in Cmaj. because I LIKED IT. It <br/>\nwas INTERESTING TO ME and I WANTED TO LEARN IT. So, I practiced THAT <br/>\nevery single solitary day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, I went through a 10 year period where I was hardly ever near a <br/>\npiano. Finally settled down, and we moved my piano from my mom&#39;s <br/>\nhouse to my newly established, married household. I bought a book of <br/>\npiano classics. One of the pieces in that music book was &quot;Maple Leaf <br/>\nRag&quot; a VERY complex work, with rapid chord changes and a ragtime <br/>\nrhythm. I taught myself to play the first movement. How? My, was I <br/>\nfocused! L My poor family must have gone nuts, as I practiced the <br/>\nsame chords over and over and over and over for hours. Literally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we moved. It would have cost more to move that old piano than <br/>\nit was worth, so we sold it. Another ten years passed. And just a <br/>\nyear or so ago, we bought a Clavinova. I LOVE IT. It came with a book <br/>\nof songs, and one of those was!!! Maple Leaf Rag! LOL I sat down with <br/>\nthat music and in five minutes, was playing that first movement as if <br/>\nI&#39;d never gone away from it. It just took looking again at the music, <br/>\nand putting my fingers in their proper places...and they flew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI now have the whole piece down pat, and have memorized the first two <br/>\nmovements. it is so much fun to play, but getting it down meant hours <br/>\nand hours of practice. Drove the poor fam nuts, again. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now that I &quot;own&quot; that song...I haven&#39;t sat down to the piano <br/>\nagain with such intense focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;d like to say was happening is this: when I was interested in <br/>\nlearning it, the knowledge soaked in like a sponge. I tend to focus <br/>\non one thing at a time, so the intensity of learning a complex piece <br/>\nof music isn&#39;t something I can do every day, or want to do every day. <br/>\nWhen I&#39;d gotten Maple Leaf Rag down, I walked away. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son is most likely doing the same thing: getting lots and lots <br/>\nof info into his brain and his fingers during times of &quot;soaking it <br/>\nup&quot; i.e. high interest in the project. When he isn&#39;t interested, his <br/>\nbrain isn&#39;t &quot;on&quot; so he doesn&#39;t as readily soak it up. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense? If someone had told me &quot;Learn this song&quot; I&#39;d <br/>\nNEVER have done it. Because of picking it up on my own, out of <br/>\nintense interest and desire to conquer it, it came to me. It&#39;s like <br/>\nhaving the desire and the interest opens up the brain to taking in <br/>\nthe thing you&#39;re learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it still took HOURS. I&#39;m an adult. Kids are quicker. Promise. <br/>\nMyelin sheathing on the brain cells. <br/>\n<br/>\nOOH! something else to add to my &quot;everything I ever learned&quot; List!
