But my kids know how<br/>\nto use them safely and correctly. So, with that context in mind, they <br/>\nhave &quot;played&quot; in ways that most young toddlers don&#39;t. Now five years<br/>\nlater, they are still playing that way, and I wonder sometimes why they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t moved onto &quot;grander&quot; things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *think* it was Sandra that answered early on that her 11 year old<br/>\ndaughter was thought of as mature by others but to her still showed many<br/>\nsigns of being a young girl. I think that&#39;s kind of where I was picking.<br/>\nMy kids are not exposed to alot of the older-kid stuff that ps kids<br/>\nare... yet those ps kids are who I often compare them too by virtue of<br/>\nthe fact that they are here every day.It&#39;s wrong, but I fall prey to it.<br/>\nThey often use grown up activities, like cooking and building and<br/>\ncreating as their &quot;play&quot; but also play with blocks and dolls...something<br/>\nthe ps kids no longer do. I hear alot of non-public schooled kids at home<br/>\n(no matter the method) reading by now or doing complicated science<br/>\nprojects. Mine do neither of that. They also, for a large part, turn to<br/>\nme for thier entertainment, maybe even increasingly so. I don&#39;t see the<br/>\nlevel of self-motivation that I seem to hear others talk about so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, both because they started playing with &quot;real&quot; things young and<br/>\nbecause they are allowed to still be kids and play with what they want,<br/>\ntheir days look almost exactly like they did 2-3 years ago. Why am I<br/>\nworried? Oh who knows? They are fine I guess. I think I just need to be<br/>\nassured of that sometimes. I&#39;m surrounded by voices of &quot;they are not&quot;<br/>\nmuch more.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that explain it better?
