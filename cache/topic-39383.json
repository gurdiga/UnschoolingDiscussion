Jean studied the<br/>\nYequana indians in the Amazon jungle, and saw how they<br/>\nraised their children. They were never &quot;coerced&quot; to do<br/>\nanything, but trusted that their innate natures would<br/>\nguide them into participation into the workings of the<br/>\ntribe. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I view unschooling.

(Remember how our toddlers would<br/>\npick up a broom and try to help?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can go on about that forever, but I&#39;ll just say<br/>\nhere, in my own experience, I would often find myself<br/>\nputting pressure on the boys to &quot;do&quot; school<br/>\nstuff...and it occured to me last year that I think<br/>\nwas envious of their opportunity to pursue whatever<br/>\ntheir interests were. SO, (duh) why don&#39;t I pursue my<br/>\nown interests, and lay off them? I started some<br/>\nprojects of own, making sure I was very conspicuous<br/>\nabout it! LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nJean Liedloff explains that it is far more natural and<br/>\ninteresting to a child to be in the presence of an<br/>\nadult who is involved in his/her own activites, and<br/>\nwelcomed to join in if desired, than to be the center<br/>\nof attention and focused upon exclusively. So, I&#39;ll<br/>\nspread my stuff all over the table, or exclaim loudly<br/>\nwhen I&#39;ve discovered something cool..and sometimes<br/>\nthey&#39;ll be curious about what I&#39;m doing, and ask to<br/>\nhelp. (Or not..but it&#39;s okay).

It depends on how<br/>\nimportant I believe it is that a child gain a certain type of knowledge.  If<br/>\nI consider it vital I will insist the child learn it while being mindful of<br/>\nmaturity and readiness to learn. If I think it is really useful for the<br/>\nchild to know about something I would try to ignite interest in a variety of<br/>\nways.  However, I would hesitate to push the child to learn where there is<br/>\nno interest when the subject is broached and back off rapidly if there is<br/>\nresistance.  I then try and work out why there is resistance/lack of<br/>\ninterest and find a way around it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you think it is detrimental, for instance, that a child totally<br/>\n&gt; uninterested in math not learn any math?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It would be extremely difficult for anyone to function effectively in our<br/>\nsociety with no mathematical knowledge.  In the adult world we rarely need<br/>\nmore than basic calculating skills.  Just about everything we need to know<br/>\nmathematically can be learned from real world activities such as price<br/>\ncomparisons when grocery shopping, working out what time to leave home to<br/>\nget to an appointment on the other side of town.  I have always encouraged<br/>\nchildren to try to figure out the answer to their own questions or if I<br/>\nprovide the answer I talk them through how I worked it out.  This does not<br/>\nhave to come across as teaching it is more about sharing information.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And is it necessary for a child uninterested in certain subjects to learn<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about those subjects<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; anyway?

In other words, &gt;IS there a certain &#39;core&#39; knowledge that they<br/>\n&#39;need&#39; to know and understand??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I can think off that a child should learn &quot;subjects&quot; that have<br/>\nno interest for them is if it is part of achieving a bigger goal.  With this<br/>\nin mind,  a child who wants to go to college would be sensible to approach<br/>\nprospective colleges a year or two in advance of applying for entry to find<br/>\nout what each requires to be considered for eligibilty.  That allows plenty<br/>\nof time to ensure any gaps are filled so the child can demonstrate their<br/>\nknowledge.  If college entry is the goal the motivation to study the<br/>\nrequired subjects, no matter how &quot;boring&quot;, should be high.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for &quot;core knowledge&quot; I think things such as inter-personal skills and<br/>\ngeneral life skills are probably more important than the academic ones as<br/>\nintellectual learning can occur at any age where emotional learning is much<br/>\nharder to change once past childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m sure my questions may sound terribly naive to most of you<br/>\n&gt; veterans...but please, be kind :)  I admit I know very little about all<br/>\n&gt; this...really, only that I love my daughter more than life itself, and<br/>\n&gt; want with all my heart for her to love learning and have a wonderful<br/>\n&gt; childhood and life!

The author conducted a systematic<br/>\nenquiry into how a hundred families educate their children at home.  His<br/>\npurpose was to examine whether individualized learning works as well in<br/>\npractice as predicted in theory.  Homeschooling families were the only place<br/>\nwhere this type of learning is the norm rather than contrived as in<br/>\nexperiments in schools.

My dh<br/>\nand I have a three year old little girl and I&#39;ve come to understand that<br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39; is what we&#39;ve been doing ever since she was born!  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that she&#39;s getting older, and I&#39;m getting more involved w/our local<br/>\nhomeschoolers and field trips, etc., I just need to build up my own<br/>\nconfidence that &#39;I&#39; can deschool MYSELF.  It&#39;s hard, you know?  My<br/>\nidealist side knows this is exactly how we want our Emma to<br/>\nlearn....with us acting more as facilitators, definitely not as her<br/>\nteachers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there&#39;s that old &#39;schooled&#39; side of me who worries that if we do,<br/>\nwill Em learn all the things she might &#39;need&#39; to know, say, to enter<br/>\ncollege.  I think, &quot;What about memorizing her multiplication tables?&quot;.<br/>\nI never did learn half of mine and still find myself counting sometimes<br/>\non my fingers (and that really embarrasses and aggravates me and only<br/>\nmakes me wish I&#39;d been &#39;taught&#39; better....even though I always hated<br/>\nmath).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen adding to my worries... I heard several unschoolers at my local<br/>\nhomeschoolers group say that in hindsight they wished they had &#39;taught&#39;<br/>\ntheir children the &#39;3 R&#39;s&#39;....They suggested unschooling for &#39;most of<br/>\nthe child&#39;s time&#39;, but also doing &#39;some&#39; teaching that you come up with<br/>\n(making it fun but still &#39;you&#39;re&#39; the one instigating it).  What are<br/>\nyour feelings on this, and what has been your experience?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think it is detrimental, for instance, that a child totally<br/>\nuninterested in math not learn any math?  And is it necessary for a<br/>\nchild uninterested in certain subjects to learn about those subjects<br/>\nanyway?  If not, how would this affect them if they chose to go to<br/>\ncollege later?  In other words, IS there a certain &#39;core&#39; knowledge that<br/>\nthey &#39;need&#39; to know and understand??<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure my questions may sound terribly naive to most of you<br/>\nveterans...but please, be kind :)  I admit I know very little about all<br/>\nthis...really, only that I love my daughter more than life itself, and<br/>\nwant with all my heart for her to love learning and have a wonderful<br/>\nchildhood and life!
