He&#39;s willing to sacrifice you<br/>\n&gt; baby&#39;s/child&#39;s/future<br/>\n&gt; adult&#39;s health?  I firmly believe that if someone is<br/>\n&gt; educated in the<br/>\n&gt; true merits of breastfeeding there would be no<br/>\n&gt; &quot;choice&quot; in infant<br/>\n&gt; nutrition.  It is absolutely the most superior<br/>\n&gt; wonder food in existence<br/>\n&gt; on the planet and no informed person could possibly<br/>\n&gt; deny that for their<br/>\n&gt; child.  It&#39;s like choosing to eat scraps from the<br/>\n&gt; dumpster instead of<br/>\n&gt; opting for tasty, delicious and healthy food in your<br/>\n&gt; own well-stocked<br/>\n&gt; kitchen.  No one who has the choice chooses dumpster<br/>\n&gt; food!  Not only<br/>\n&gt; will nursing supply your baby with an immune system<br/>\n&gt; and sustain your<br/>\n&gt; child even through illness (it&#39;s the perfect<br/>\n&gt; medicinal food when your<br/>\n&gt; baby has a cold or diarrhea or is vomiting) but the<br/>\n&gt; health benefits last<br/>\n&gt; well into adulthood.  Lower rates of allergies,<br/>\n&gt; sensitivities, diabetes,<br/>\n&gt; even cancers.  This is all well documented.  Babies<br/>\n&gt; fed ARTIFICIAL food<br/>\n&gt; such as formula, or worse, COW&#39;S MILK have higher<br/>\n&gt; statistics on<br/>\n&gt; everything negative except maybe brain development. <br/>\n&gt; Which has been<br/>\n&gt; well-documented for breast-fed babies:  higher<br/>\n&gt; intelligence for the<br/>\n&gt; amino acids present in breast milk.  No formula can<br/>\n&gt; replicate that!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry to be on this tirade but I positively see<br/>\n&gt; red when I see<br/>\n&gt; people think there is a &quot;choice&quot; and usually for the<br/>\n&gt; sake of unimportant<br/>\n&gt; and temporary situations such as convenience or<br/>\n&gt; lifestyle.  How can any<br/>\n&gt; loving parent deny their child what is clearly<br/>\n&gt; theirs?  Boy, have the<br/>\n&gt; formula companies or, dare I say it, the radical<br/>\n&gt; feminists, really<br/>\n&gt; snowed us that much, all these years?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure I&#39;m making a few enemies tonight with these<br/>\n&gt; views but 10 solid<br/>\n&gt; years of research into the subject have brought me<br/>\n&gt; to these conclusions.<br/>\n&gt; Yes, most babies will grow according to the growth<br/>\n&gt; charts<br/>\n&gt; (interestingly-enough supplied by the formula<br/>\n&gt; companies) when fed by<br/>\n&gt; artificial means, but most of the time we are<br/>\n&gt; forfeiting quality for<br/>\n&gt; quantity (the pounds babies gain).  People can seem<br/>\n&gt; to grow and gain<br/>\n&gt; weight eating dumpster food too...Formula is made of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Scraps&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; by-products:  leftover and sour milk processed into<br/>\n&gt; powders, the lowest<br/>\n&gt; grades of corn syrup, coconut and palm oils<br/>\n&gt; (recognized poison for the<br/>\n&gt; heart) and a few fake versions of vitamins. <br/>\n&gt; Mechanically-produced and<br/>\n&gt; rarely efficiently absorbed by the system. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I say, there is no true choice.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sign me,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a radical-baby&#39;s-rights-defender<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ron and Stephanie wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Karen-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yep, you got it!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; here I am asking you another question about abb.<br/>\n&gt; words:  is LLL Le Leche<br/>\n&gt; &gt; League?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am very interested in LLL.
