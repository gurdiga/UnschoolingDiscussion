It&#39;s one of the authors she <br/>\n  &gt; always recommends to parents when they come into the bookstore <br/>\n  &gt; looking for books their kids might enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And that got my kids interested in E. Nesbitt books (because Edward Eager <br/>\n  mentions them in his books) and then PBS showed the WONDERFUL movie of &quot;The <br/>\n  Railway Children&quot; -- it was lovely.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My oldest daughter was in school until 4th grade. Yet ANOTHER reason I <br/>\n  started giving up on school was that her teacher couldn&#39;t get permission to <br/>\n  have &quot;Half Magic&quot; be used in their supposedly &quot;Literature-Based Mathematics&quot; <br/>\n  program. Half-Magic was not on the approved literature list for the State of <br/>\n  California -- so she applied to have it added and it was turned down. The <br/>\n  only explanation was that it was &quot;too old and outdated.&quot; She and I were both <br/>\n  disgusted -- what kind of reason is THAT? Are they going to use that reason <br/>\n  for eliminating all the great literature of the past? Yeah, right.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --pam<br/>\n<br/>\n  National Home Education Network<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\n  Changing the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
