I just have to share a vaguely <br/>\nunschooling/unfooding kind of story from this morning about the Wiggles.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan (4.5) came downstairs to say goodbye to his father at 8:30 this <br/>\nmorning to show him a book of Leonard Bernsteins he had taped together from <br/>\nhis Dad&#39;s discarded homemade cd covers.

And we could watch - (here he <br/>\ncarefully placed on the floor in front of him his comfort toys from sleeping: <br/>\ntwo finger puppet ballerinas, the Leonard Bernstein book, two gingersnaps has <br/>\nasked for before bed last night, his teddy and his well-worn, hole-y blue <br/>\nblankie) - THE WIGGLES.&quot;  He did the butt wiggling dance with the arms <br/>\njogging in front as he said Wiggles, then picked up all his stuff and dashed <br/>\noff to the sun room to find the tape.  They watched the tape once at <br/>\nChristmas when they got it, this is their second time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe just cracks me up sometimes.  He can identify many conductors and <br/>\ncomposers from pictures, knows more about classical music at his age than I <br/>\ndid at 20, enjoys snuggling with gingersnaps on his bedside and then eats <br/>\nthem for breakfast (with Cheerios and milk) in front of the Wiggles!
