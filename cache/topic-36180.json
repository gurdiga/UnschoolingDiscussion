For <br/>\nthose of you who think you&#39;ve heard it all already feel free to delete <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWyndham is a child with many problems.  He has lots of <br/>\nallergies/sensitivities.  He hasn&#39;t been diagnosed by a pro yet, but <br/>\nwe suspect Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  The therapist he is seeing <br/>\ntoday (who has seen me alone once) thinks he may have Anxiety Disorder <br/>\ntoo.  We are also going to try to rule out Tourette.  There are enough <br/>\nsymtomps to make us take a closer look.<br/>\n<br/>\nA year and a half ago, Wyndham was a mess.  Always unhappy, always <br/>\nfrustrated because he couldn&#39;t do the thing he wanted to be able to <br/>\ndo and couldn&#39;t learn how.  I was not able to help him with some of <br/>\nthe things he wanted either.  The things I did with the girls that <br/>\nworked so well for them, seemed to make him worse.  Things like <br/>\nletting them be.  Letting them choose their own everything from food <br/>\n(except corn in Rachel&#39;s case) to books to sleep times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my mom moved into the other house on our property.  She started <br/>\ncoming over in the morning and getting him.  She would make him <br/>\nbreakfast, and then &#39;teach&#39; him the things he wanted to learn.  In the <br/>\nbeginning, he was just going for the food.  But within six months he <br/>\nhad structured his entire day around his time with her and his <br/>\nfavorite TV shows.  That&#39;s when I realized that what he had needed all <br/>\nalong was the one thing I am simply not capable of giving - structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she does over there with him now during his so called &#39;school <br/>\ntime&#39; varies.  She has textbooks and workbooks and such but they skip <br/>\nover the parts he isn&#39;t really interested in and focus more an the <br/>\nstuff he is.  He went from not being able to read anything at 9, to <br/>\nbeing an above his age-level reader at 10.  Part of that had to do <br/>\nwith being more ready, but part of being more ready had to do with <br/>\nfinding his structure.  That plays into the Anxiety Disorder suspicion <br/>\nthat the therapist has a lot I think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, they go for walks, they do experiments, they read his train <br/>\nbooks (although as I said before, she threw that one back to dh and I <br/>\n- can&#39;t blame her, I&#39;m sick of trains too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I still consider him an unschooler is because I think he is <br/>\nstill doing exactly what he wants to be doing and I KNOW he is loads <br/>\nhappier now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., PSoroosh@a... wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bridget -- just because you use Wyndham as an example fairly <br/>\nfrequently, it <br/>\n&gt; might help to explain further what happens at your mom&#39;s.

How the parent<br/>\nthen facilitates the child exploring that interest will be different for<br/>\neach child and each parent. It may at times resemble something kids would do<br/>\nin school. Most times it won&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, as a beginning point, look at it as how you&#39;d like your husband to<br/>\nhelp you explore an interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;d probably appreciate it if he happened to notice a book or video or<br/>\narticle or event that might interest you and point them out to you or buy<br/>\nthem for you. You wouldn&#39;t want him to take over the interest and feel your<br/>\nlearning was his responsibility and how much you learned depended entirely<br/>\non how well he performed for you. You wouldn&#39;t want him to overwhelm you<br/>\nwith an itinerary of things to do. You wouldn&#39;t want him hovering over you<br/>\nto see how much and how well you were learning. I think you&#39;d appreciate<br/>\nbeing left alone to explore at your own pace, to delve as deeply or<br/>\nshallowly as whimsy strikes you. Any help he gave you would be a gift with<br/>\nno strings attached.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course kids are different. Younger kids generally aren&#39;t scanning the<br/>\nlist of week&#39;s activities in the newspaper and may not even care to look up<br/>\nbooks at the library. (The process of finding the information and sorting<br/>\nout the useful from the not useful can be overwhelming.) So we need to be<br/>\nmore active, but still recognize that the child owns the interest and should<br/>\nhave the freedom to explore as deeply or shallowly as he or she wishes.  We<br/>\njust make sure the resources are available. (And if we get frustrated with<br/>\nthem not digging deep enough, then *we* should dig deeper for *ourselves*<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that doesn&#39;t rule out something that resembles a unit study. Some kids<br/>\nlike to live and breathe something for a while. (Where our husbands would<br/>\nassume we&#39;d be able to set up our own &quot;unit study&quot; to pursue our own<br/>\ninterests, our kids would proabably appreciate some help.) It doesn&#39;t rule<br/>\nout mom coming up with some nifty &quot;learning activities&quot;. But we shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nfeel their learning depends on it. Their learning depends entirely on them<br/>\nand the quality of the environment they have to explore in. (And the<br/>\nenvironment includes parents who are actively learning and interested in<br/>\nlife -- and interested in their kids too. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t not do some parent-directed activity that my daughter would enjoy<br/>\nbut I&#39;d be aware of how she&#39;s learning about learning. If she&#39;s getting the<br/>\nidea that in order to learn, she needs mom to put on a performance for her,<br/>\nthen I&#39;d make sure she had more access to child-directed resources too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course another part of unschooling is strewing their paths. We don&#39;t need<br/>\nour husbands to run the world past us to help us discover new interests<br/>\nbecause we&#39;re pretty capable of exploring the world on our own. But we do<br/>\nneed to filter and direct some of the world into our kids&#39; lives so they<br/>\nhave access to new interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2003","postDate":"1019969184","msgId":36216,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4RjBFODg1LkE0MSVhYnRsZW9AZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTk5MDcxNDcuNDM2LjQ2NDgubTEyQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36180,"nextInTopic":36224,"prevInTime":36215,"nextInTime":36217,"topicId":36180,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
