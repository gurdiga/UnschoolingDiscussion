I&#39;m not <br/>\ndisagreeing <br/>\n-- just want to make sure I understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy, sorry, I got confused there, so also sorry to Tia!  To answer your <br/>\nquestion, yes, I think their reasons should be respected as much as ours, but also <br/>\nI think we need to actually take the TIME to find out what their reasons are.  <br/>\nAnd when they don&#39;t know, I try to help my children think a little further, <br/>\nbut if they can&#39;t figure it out, well, heck, sometimes I can&#39;t figure out why I <br/>\ndo things either.  But I think it all comes down to what was said <br/>\nearlier-parents (from what I&#39;ve seen) use spanking because they either don&#39; t know or <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to take the time to figure out another solution.  How easy would it be <br/>\nto explain to Rupert (tired of Johnny) that running out in front of a car <br/>\ncould kill you?  Why not tell him his body could be come mangled, etc.-why not <br/>\ngive him age/maturity appropriate information?  And if you have to do it more <br/>\nthan once, well, there are things that have had to be explained to me more than <br/>\nonce!  I just think if we respect our children like we do complete strangers <br/>\nmaybe -well, you get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  Amy, if you are ever in the Orlando area, I&#39;ll take you up on that <br/>\ndrink.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83547,"nextTopicId":83561}}
