Two or three years later, when she<br/>\nwas playing games with scores that were 4 digits long or more and doing<br/>\nthem in her head her way became too laborious for her, she asked me about<br/>\nhow I was adding my score. I was using that same traditional algorithm,<br/>\nadding the ones, carrying the tens, all that.
