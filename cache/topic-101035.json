He does not communicate his feelings very<br/>\n  &gt; well yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d second the book recommendations and the NoMoreSpanking list.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the meantime, I think it will help you look at his behavior differently<br/>\n  if you see that he&#39;s reacting out of supreme frustration. It&#39;s not that he<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t know better but that when he&#39;s in a situation where he wants things<br/>\n  to happen differently he doesn&#39;t know how to make that happen. He only knows<br/>\n  he&#39;s not supposed to hit. So he gets frustrated and he hits.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But understanding why isn&#39;t the same as condoning, of course. You need to<br/>\n  stop him each time he&#39;s hitting and yelling at your daughter. (Even keep him<br/>\n  occupied by your side if it&#39;s happening too often and getting her stresed<br/>\n  out.) She needs to feel safe in her own home and needs to feel that someone<br/>\n  will come running if there&#39;s someone trying to hurt her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But treat him hitting her separate from helping him learn better ways. He<br/>\n  can&#39;t stop being frustrated (and therefore hitting) unitl he has and can use<br/>\n  in high emotional times better tools to deal with the sitaution.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Stopping your daughter from being hurt is one issue. Tell him that&#39;s not an<br/>\n  acceptable way to let people know his feelings. You may have to do that a<br/>\n  fair number of times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But then as a separate issue, help him figure out better ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra had a three step process for kids to go through. (I was going to try<br/>\n  to paraphrase but I found a quote :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; When they were little the I&#39;d tell them they couldn&#39;t hit unless they had<br/>\n  &gt; first tried to talk about it, THEN get an adult to help them solve their<br/>\n  &gt; problem, and if that didn&#39;t help then they could hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n  Yahoo!
