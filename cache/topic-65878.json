Peter Magrath, president of the National<br/>\nAssociation of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, is<br/>\nrecommending that the amount of time students<br/>\nspend on writing be doubled, that writing be taught in all subjects and<br/>\nat all grade levels and that every school district adopt a writing plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If students are to make knowledge their own, they must struggle with<br/>\nthe details, wrestle with the facts and rework raw information and dimly<br/>\nunderstood concepts into<br/>\nlanguage they can communicate to someone else,&quot; the report said. &quot;In<br/>\nshort, if students are to learn, they must write.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn two decades of education reform, the teaching of reading and<br/>\narithmetic has come under intense scrutiny, with increased state<br/>\nregulation and a host of new assessment<br/>\ntests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut until recently the teaching of writing has been largely overlooked.<br/>\nThat seems to be changing now. With everyone from employers to college<br/>\nprofessors expressing alarm<br/>\nabout the dismal writing skills of most American students, there is a<br/>\nnew urgency, and new energy, to upgrade the teaching of writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of the major college-entrance exams, the SAT and the ACT, are being<br/>\nrevised to include writing tests, and last year the College Board, which<br/>\nadministers the SAT,<br/>\ncreated the National Commission on Writing to study the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe panel found that only about half of the nation&#39;s 12th graders report<br/>\nbeing regularly assigned papers of three or more pages in English class;<br/>\nabout 4 in 10 say they never,<br/>\nor hardly ever, get such assignments. Part of the problem is that many<br/>\nhigh school teachers have 120 to 200 students, and so reading and<br/>\ngrading even a weekly one-page<br/>\npaper per student would be a substantial task.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the National Assessment of Educational Progress exam, only about one<br/>\nin four students in Grades 4, 8 or 12 scored at the proficient level in<br/>\nwriting in 1998, the most<br/>\nrecent such results available. And only one in a hundred was graded<br/>\n&quot;advanced.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, a 2002 study of California college students found that most<br/>\nfreshmen could not analyze arguments, synthesize information or write<br/>\npapers that were reasonably free<br/>\nof language errors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some encouraging signs, though, among them the growth of the<br/>\nNational Writing Project, a professional-development effort that began<br/>\nat the University of<br/>\nCalifornia at Berkeley almost 30 years ago and has expanded to 175 sites<br/>\nnationwide, where teacher networks are fostered at five-week summer<br/>\nsessions on writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe commission&#39;s report is to be followed by a five-year campaign to<br/>\nfulfill its recommendations. That campaign, called &quot;A Writing Challenge<br/>\nto the Nation,&quot; will be led by<br/>\nformer Senator Bob Kerrey, president of the New School University.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our spiritual lives, our economic success and our social networks,&quot; Mr.<br/>\nKerrey said, &quot;are all directly affected by our willingness to do the<br/>\nwork necessary to acquire the<br/>\nskill of writing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust how much national will exists to do that work remains the crucial<br/>\nquestion, educators and policy experts agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This report is a great beginning,&quot; said the executive director of the<br/>\nNational Writing Project, Richard Sterling, chairman of the commission&#39;s<br/>\nadvisory board. &quot;If this is the<br/>\ntrigger that allows us to step up to the kind of interest there has been<br/>\naround reading and math, it will make a big difference in children&#39;s<br/>\neducation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But the commission could sink without a trace unless we go forth and<br/>\nsay: How does it actually happen? How do we get the recommendations into<br/>\npolicy? How do we get<br/>\nenough professional development for teachers? How do we recognize the<br/>\nexcellent work that&#39;s going on?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                            Copyright 2003 The New York Times Company</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65906,"nextTopicId":65910}}
