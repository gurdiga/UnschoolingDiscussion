We have an attached apartment<br/>\nthat my mom lives in. Eventually it will be empty and someone will be able<br/>\nto use it. Depending on how long it takes and how old any of the kids are.<br/>\nTara knows it&#39;s there for her if she wants it. Maybe for free, maybe for<br/>\nrent, depending on the situation. I have often thought of what I would do or<br/>\nhow we would work that if it came about. As in if she wanted someone in<br/>\nthere with her. I think if she were paying rent herself, then she can do<br/>\nwhat she decides as far as where the money comes from. Her staying there for<br/>\nfree with someone else wouldn&#39;t work for me. I think you made the best<br/>\ndecision.
