I understand and agree with <br/>\nthe opinions expressed by list members that the child&#39;s desire for a <br/>\ncurriculum should be tested, whether such testing is by way of time, money, <br/>\nintellect, or some other way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER, and again in my opinion, it is hypocritical and prejudicial of us to <br/>\nbelieve that it is unschooling when a child chooses to cook, play with sticks <br/>\nin the dirt, or milk the cows, but that it is anti-unschooling for a child to <br/>\nchoose to self-impose a curriculum.  The distinction between subject matters, <br/>\nin my opinion, is artificial.  As someone (I believe it was you, Sandra) <br/>\nproperly (I think) pointed out, unschooling is not about the subjects, it is <br/>\nabout the method.  Thus, if this child wishes to use a curriculum then I <br/>\nwould not squelch that desire merely because of some fear that the act of <br/>\nstudying a curriculum might somehow interfere with one&#39;s concept of <br/>\nunschooling.  If the child chose it, then it is unschooling.  That&#39;s my <br/>\nunderstanding of unschooling, anyway, even though it may not be yours or <br/>\nanyone else&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, then, the presence or absence of a curriculum does not <br/>\ncorrelate with the presence or absence of unschooling.  Whether the child <br/>\ncaused the presence or absence of a curriculum, however, does correlate with <br/>\nthe presence of absence of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate Davis<br/>\n<br/>\nKate Davis  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschooling-dotcom] Forced Unschooling","postDate":"1020007985","msgId":36273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNi5kMDRkODU2LjI5ZmQ3MDMxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36270,"nextInTopic":36277,"prevInTime":36272,"nextInTime":36274,"topicId":36196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/28/02 9:22:58 AM, Katedavislawfirm@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1023243356\">In a message dated 4/28/02 9:22:58 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Katedavislawfirm@...\">Katedavislawfirm@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Saying one cannot afford curricula is not the same thing as saying one <br/>\ndisapproves of or discourages it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the context of this discussion, a mother who no longer wants to use a <br/>\ncurriculum felt obligated to buy an expensive one because her son wanted it.  <br/>\nSomeone suggested a cheaper one.

He likes <br/>\ndoing unit studies and going on fieldtrips and such and he knows that he <br/>\nlearns things outside of &quot;work time&quot;. Though, I don&#39;t think he understands <br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t *need* all this &quot;stuff&quot; imposed on him to learn &quot;properly&quot;, <br/>\nwhich is something that&#39;s hard to get through to anyone, let alone a stubborn <br/>\nten year old, especially when you still have some doubts yourself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\nHomeschooling Mom to Five<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Forced Unschooling","postDate":"1019947735","msgId":36205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxOU1Wd1ZuMjBsYmhzS2Q2UVIwMDAwMjNiYUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36196,"nextInTopic":36207,"prevInTime":36204,"nextInTime":36206,"topicId":36196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He has <br/>\nbeen told all his life that *this* (meaning schooly stuff) is how you learn. <br/>\nIn fact, it&#39;s the ONLY way you learn. And if you don&#39;t do it, and do it <br/>\n&quot;right&quot;, you&#39;ll fail to learn anything. He&#39;s scared. That&#39;s not the best <br/>\npoint from which to make the best decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is not a criticism of his parents, or saying that his mom has told <br/>\nhim all this. This message is everywhere. He&#39;s probably truly afraid that <br/>\nhe&#39;ll amount to nothing and be ignorant his whole life. He needs to <br/>\nexperience another way in order to get comfortable with it. It&#39;s why we all <br/>\nfeel the need to find support. We&#39;re going against the accepted norm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, even though he&#39;s asking for curriculum, and I wouldn&#39;t force him to shun <br/>\nit exactly, I would do my best to point out and share all the other millions <br/>\nof real-world opportunities for learning out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy newest thought on the matter is to just keep telling him &quot;next week&quot;. <br/>\nWe&#39;ll get that curriculum next week. Spelling tests? Oh yeah, I&#39;ll have <br/>\ngreat words for you next week. If he goes along with the game of never <br/>\ngetting to the curriculum then great. If he gets upset and wants next week <br/>\n&quot;right now&quot;, then go to plan B and bring out the eclectic low-cost, no <br/>\npressure stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":97649338,"authorName":"Katedavislawfirm@aol.com","from":"Katedavislawfirm@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[unschooling-dotcom] Forced Unschooling","postDate":"1019935882","msgId":36196,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNiLjI1ZTBjYTI2LjI5ZmM1NjhhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36205,"prevInTime":36195,"nextInTime":36197,"topicId":36196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/27/2002 3:24:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
