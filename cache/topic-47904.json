That<br/>\nwas really all... they even make corner-shaped little boxes for ferrets<br/>\nnow. My ferret was an abused and abandoned ferret (a recurrent theme for<br/>\nmy pets), and she was very small for a ferret, she weighed just under a<br/>\npound. I used plastic tupperware containers as litterboxes, they were<br/>\nabout 8&quot; x 8&quot;. My parents had cages for their ferrets, very large ones<br/>\nand they ran around a lot, but they never did end up reliably litterbox<br/>\ntrained - I think their house was too big and they needed to have a<br/>\ncouple boxes at least. They had, at one time, 4 ferrets, 3 dogs, 2 pygmy<br/>\nhedgehogs (mean little buggers, although other people have told me<br/>\nthey&#39;ve had nice ones) and a chinchilla. The very, very sad day was when<br/>\nsomeone left the chinchilla and the ferrets running around together :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had someone tell me that ferrets needed to be watched all of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>time<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (no free roaming) because they will try to get out any hole they <br/>\n&gt; could find. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They can go through very small holes, about the size of a quarter is what<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard. I wouldn&#39;t want holes that size leading out of my house,<br/>\nthough... and Maia never tried to sneak out or anything. They&#39;re curious,<br/>\nbut they&#39;re a domesticated animal - Maia never wanted to leave, she came<br/>\nwhen I called her (I gave her nutrimalt as a reward when training her).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Do they become gentle and wanting affection like a cat or dog? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maia definitely did, and so did my parents&#39; four, although to varying<br/>\ndegrees. Part of that may be because there were 4 of them - the rat we<br/>\nhad as an only rat is definitely the most affectionate, because she&#39;s had<br/>\nthe most attention. Buddy was the albino ferret who loved Spike the blue<br/>\nheeler, he was quite snuggly. They sleep a lot but when they&#39;re up, they<br/>\ntend to be more playful than cuddly. Maia would play for a while, then<br/>\ncrawl around and then curl up next to me and fall asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe died when Rain was a year and a half old, and she was around 8 years<br/>\nold then. All of our ferrets have been fine with kids except one of my<br/>\nparent&#39;s females, who was the least affectionate and occasionally nipped.<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t great pets for little kids, although Rain loved Maia - I<br/>\npersonally think guinea pigs are the perfect &quot;small&quot; pets for toddlers,<br/>\nbecause they&#39;re big enough that they can&#39;t be easily squeezed and they&#39;re<br/>\nplacid enough to not run away. But it&#39;s hard for a real little kid to<br/>\nplay with a wriggly ferret. My sister was around 6 when my parents&#39; got<br/>\ntheir first one, though, and she was the one who convinced them to<br/>\nacquire 3 more over the next couple of years...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47880,"nextTopicId":47875}}
