I have 3 kids, all who have been home<br/>\nwith me living and learning. We had a tough year last year, with my oldest<br/>\nalmost 8 year old being fussy and her brother bugging her. She asked and asked<br/>\nto go to school. So I signed her up. Off she goes every day with her dad and<br/>\nthe neighborhood kids. She likes the structure her teacher provides. She is<br/>\nobserving everything. We pick her up at 2:30. Such a radical scedule change<br/>\nfor me. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday after school she decided to make a grid and chart all the kids in her<br/>\nclass. She made categories . Super nice, nice, kinda nice, kinda mean, really<br/>\nmean. She wants to see how the kids in her class do for several days. She aked<br/>\nfor 50 copies of her chart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting to understand what she needs from school. I see her as an<br/>\nunschooled schoolgirl. Being a schoolgirl is her passion right now. She is<br/>\nliving, breathing school. She is finding out what she likes and does not like.<br/>\nI still cringe when I hear some of the playground attitudes. She is expanding.<br/>\nShe is learning how to be alive and in the world without me and she enjoys the<br/>\nchallenge. Where she would whine with me for being hot, she now is hot,<br/>\nuncomfortable, and gets through it. I&#39;m sad still she not with us, and glad<br/>\ntoo she fledging a bit. I see her coming home so glad to be able to strip into<br/>\nnothing, curl up in her bed and read, her style. She thinks it&#39;s funny that<br/>\npeople are asked to read at least 20 minutes each day. Her friends translate<br/>\nthat to only 20 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ll go now. I&#39;ve been expanding and growing and surrendering these<br/>\nfirst few school weeks and now I get to panic a bit about 5.5 son and his<br/>\nwilds and potty talk and throwing balls at people and grabbing his sisters<br/>\ndoll. O.K. I know why he does this, I&#39;m talking on the phone. I need to go<br/>\nshoot baskets with him, again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44511,"nextTopicId":44518}}
