Aiee.)  Now I <br/>\nlive about 20 minutes north.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Sunnyvale is a very nice town for raising kids.  They have a great <br/>\nparks and rec department, youth theatre, etc, etc.  It&#39;s a very kid and <br/>\nfamily-focused town.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last few years, a large influx of Asian families (lots of High Tech <br/>\nin the area) have moved in, so it&#39;s easy to find really authentic asian <br/>\nfood and grocery items.  Delicious eating!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe library&#39;s pretty good and the kids section is larger than most in the <br/>\narea.  Their mall is awful.  They have a great cheap-grocery place near the <br/>\nmiddle of town, which I kind of miss.  I also miss the slightly loopy woman <br/>\nwho runs a plant nursery out of her home on Mathilda Rd.  You can&#39;t even <br/>\nsee the terrific old (falling apart) house because of all the plants in <br/>\nfront of it.  She&#39;s open when she feels like it, and closed the rest of the <br/>\ntime.  Her prices are pretty low but I shop there because it makes me <br/>\nchuckle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s a Teacher Resource place in the area where you (as a private <br/>\nschool proprietor) can go to get odds and ends of this and that for <br/>\nfree/low cost/etc.  They even have a laminator (for making those School <br/>\nID&#39;s.)  It&#39;s called RAFT... resource &#39;something&#39; for teachers, I <br/>\nthink.  They&#39;re pretty nice and will let you tour the place before you <br/>\ndecide to join.  One of my kids was always gluing something to something <br/>\nelse, so I&#39;d go there to get bits and pieces of this and that for them to <br/>\nglue up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunnyvale&#39;s pretty nice.<br/>\nHeidiWD</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Sunnyvale?","postDate":"1055047967","msgId":72840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzIwMWMzMmQ3OSRjZWZlNzA2MCQwNTAwMDAwYUBtYWJiLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE1LjEyZGRjOWJmLjJjMTNlZDIzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72763,"nextInTopic":73935,"prevInTime":72839,"nextInTime":72841,"topicId":72763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
