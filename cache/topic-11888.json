We have been taught<br/>\nthat tobacco(plain tobacco)  is sacred, and carries  prayers to the<br/>\ncreator.  We do not smoke mainstream brand cigerettes, only 100%<br/>\ntobacco.....we think that the chemicals that are added to the tobacco, are<br/>\nwhat are most addicting & harmful.  And we choose not to give money to the<br/>\ncigerette compnaies that put chemicals in their tobacco.  But I&#39;ve thought<br/>\nalot on this topic, and I tend to think also that there are many other<br/>\nfactors contributing to lunge cancer, which are purposefully not being<br/>\nlooked at close enough.  The pollution that cars & trucks make in our<br/>\ncities everyday, must have an effect on the lungs, and no-one is about to<br/>\nsay quit driving..they aren&#39;t even going to suggest that this may CAUSE<br/>\nlung cancer.  How about the pollutants of many businesses.and products.you<br/>\nsee the the clouds of chemical smoke going into the air, but are we<br/>\nstopping it?? People use paints, and cleaning supplies that have harmful<br/>\nchemicals to the lungs, everyday. The war on tobacco companies is all about<br/>\nmoney...the facts, and tests are propaganda for one side or the other in my<br/>\nopinion...if.you inflict any extreme ammount of any constituant on any<br/>\nthing for a duration of time, and it will become toxic...High levels , and<br/>\nextremes are toxic of any one thing..vitamins, Minerals nutrients, Our<br/>\nbodies are made as such we need a variety of different things at different<br/>\nstages and times(in my opinion)  Everything in Moderation.... It is not the<br/>\ntobacco itself that is the culprit of lung cancer, in my opinion. I am not<br/>\nsaying that high levels of nicotine on an already weak lung will not affect<br/>\nit, surely it will. I think if one leads an overall healthy life, that this<br/>\nis very important & this demonstrates respect for oneself, and the<br/>\nenvironment, but when it comes down to it, when the time comes , the time<br/>\ncomes, whether you&#39;ve been a smoker or not.  I do not think, personally<br/>\nthat any death is before it&#39;s time, whatever the cause, and I&#39;am not<br/>\ndismmissing the pain caused by losing  a loved one.... , and mean deeply<br/>\nnot to offend anyone who has lost a family member whose autopsy stated lung<br/>\ncancer as the cause, Many Blessings to you, and may they be in<br/>\npeace.....but I think the best thing to suggest if you want to quit smoking<br/>\nis to either just STOP...or at least switch to an all organic tobacco, with<br/>\nno chemicals or additives, at least you will be more likely to quit when<br/>\nyou are ready, and won&#39;t be contributing hard earned dollars to a company<br/>\nyou do not believe or trust in.  Just my 2 cents.......Totally NOT<br/>\nintending to make anyone mad, or insult anyone else&#39;s beliefs on this one. <br/>\nI also believe we all have a right to our place in the mind, meaning, I<br/>\nrespect others to have the beliefs they have, and to be at the stage in<br/>\nlife they are in.  Everything is in it&#39;s place, and everything is in<br/>\ntransition.  But lastly, I do believe all plants, including tobacco to be<br/>\nSacred, a gift from the Earth MOther..and Tobacco particularly to be a<br/>\nSacred plant , whose smoke carries our prayers to the Spirit world......I<br/>\ndo not support BIg Tobacco COmpanies, or any other Large Corporate Entity. <br/>\nMany Blessings in fullfilling that which you want for yourself.
