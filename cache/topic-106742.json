I have an 11yo son and 2yo daughter. This past year, we<br/>\ntried homeschooling and have never looked back. As the year went on, I<br/>\nbecame drawn to unschooling. The more I have read and discussed, the<br/>\nmore I know that this is a philosophy that makes sense in my heart. I<br/>\nknow that since my ds has been in school for some time, there will be<br/>\nadjustments, and I&#39;m glad that my dd will never have to go to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest issue I&#39;m having right now is that every person in my home<br/>\nis a right-brained thinker, and I&#39;m the sole left-brained thinker. Why<br/>\nshould that matter when you&#39;re unschooling? Well, I have been doing my<br/>\nbest to follow their interests and really stretching myself to try<br/>\nthings I never would have. I have enjoyed it very much and am glad<br/>\nthat we&#39;re on this adventure together. I guess that I sometimes feel<br/>\ndrained when most of our activities are centered around activities<br/>\nthat right-brained thinkers enjoy, like playing in the mud and<br/>\nbuilding. Like I said, I&#39;ve enjoyed things like this, but I feel that<br/>\nthings can be out of balance because I would love spending the day<br/>\nreading or doing quieter activities. I&#39;m not saying that I want things<br/>\nmy way, but rather I&#39;m wondering if someone can help me see how<br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs get met when our interests are all over the board. I<br/>\nalso want to avoid all of us leading a solitary existence under the<br/>\nsame roof.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease be easy on me...I&#39;m new to all of this and maybe I&#39;m missing<br/>\nsomething fundamental to the homeschooling philosophy. I really want<br/>\nto make this work. Friends have told me to just let go, but<br/>\nleft-brainers and right-brainers go about this in completely different<br/>\nways ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all of your input and understanding. I&#39;m glad I found such<br/>\na thoughtful group of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106741,"nextTopicId":106696}}
