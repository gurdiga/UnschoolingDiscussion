I think I also have a slightly different point of <br/>\nview than most others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always considered whatever animals I allow in (or around) the house <br/>\nto be my responsibility. To me, the dividend for the kids is not the daily <br/>\ndrudgery of cleaning cages and taking dogs for walks, but the enjoyment of <br/>\ncuddling a cat or guinea pig and the love they give you back, or the <br/>\nscientific interest in watching an aquarium environment or a hermit crab. I <br/>\ntry to model loving and responsible care of the creatures and I think I have <br/>\nsucceeded in setting a good example, because the kids are kind to them and <br/>\nrespectful of all animals. I can say from the kids&#39; point of view, the <br/>\nanimals have all been a 100 percent positive and enjoyable experience -- no <br/>\ndrudgery. They usually do feed or water the animals on the occasions when I <br/>\nask (sometimes they say they&#39;re busy with something else, and I don&#39;t force <br/>\nit) and they always are eager to cuddle and feed a guinea pig during story <br/>\ntime or while watching TV. (I think guinea pigs are the ideal pet for this <br/>\nage group -- domesticated, cuddly, not nocturnal, hardy and, well, darn cute <br/>\nin their beady-eyed way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a young teen-ager we got a dog (at my request) and it was my <br/>\nresponsibility to walk it and feed it. After a few years, I really  dreaded <br/>\nthe chores and was thoroughly tired of the dog. I am not crazy about dogs to <br/>\nthis day. I am hoping to spare my kids this type of negative experience. <br/>\n(Another good thing about guinea pigs -- they usually only live about four <br/>\nor five years.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past the guys have asked for a dog, and I always say no because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to take care of one, listen to it bark in the yard, clean up <br/>\nafter it, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bronwen","from":"&quot;Bronwen&quot; &lt;felesina@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"X7g8BSI_GuQydhGvaH_CS1a6sD9vKf4rMGRyAhRZ3CcOdq_lWA04ecHsmYNUGmDe8x60e8d4ZMOfJFuvp9iGAbkFXijy","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets!","postDate":"995388052","msgId":22902,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMTkwMWMxMGVkZiQ0NGVmMTZhMCQ4MTE0MTVkMUB1c2VyPg==","referencesHeader":"PDlhLjE3MDY3MWQ0LjI4ODJlZmI3QGFvbC5jb20+IDwzQjUyMkRDQy4wMDAwMDkuOTU0NzdAYnJvb2tlPg=="},"prevInTopic":22898,"nextInTopic":22906,"prevInTime":22901,"nextInTime":22903,"topicId":22874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Brooke :-) ...

In high school I had a<br/>\n&gt; rat named Spike, who came to school with me. Our latest rat was Harry<br/>\n&gt; Potter (a hooded rat with a white line of fur on his forehead). He was a<br/>\n&gt; domestic rat but we got him from the animal shelter where he had been<br/>\n&gt; turned in as a stray... before that my daughter was briefly in the<br/>\n&gt; mouse-breeding business, and before that we had a hamster who would run<br/>\n&gt; around loose and sleep with the cats (we have oh-so-wimpy cats), and<br/>\n&gt; before that we had a ferret, who would also run around loose but would<br/>\n&gt; chase the cats.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I actually like ferrets best, but now we&#39;re in California where they have<br/>\n&gt; misguidedly made them illegal... so we&#39;re thinking of a chinchilla next,<br/>\n&gt; although my daughter really would prefer to have a rabbit again, I<br/>\n&gt; think...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve never really had pets that ended up being hers or mine, they&#39;ve all<br/>\n&gt; sort of ended up being family pets... like, Harry was mine, but she would<br/>\n&gt; play with him and hold him while I cleaned the cage and stuff (in his<br/>\n&gt; dottage, Harry bit her friend&#39;s finger and blood spurted everywhere, that<br/>\n&gt; was exciting) and I helped with her mice, and she feeds the cats<br/>\n&gt; sometimes which have got to be techinically my pets because they&#39;re older<br/>\n&gt; than she is. I guess it just seems easier to me for each of us to do<br/>\n&gt; stuff as it needs to be done... I mean, if she was around and I was<br/>\n&gt; zipping past the mouse cage and noticed that the water was low, I would<br/>\n&gt; mention it to her in passing and expect that when she came to a good<br/>\n&gt; stopping place in what she was doing, she&#39;d take care of it... which<br/>\n&gt; worked often enough to keep me from feeling put-upon, most of the time<br/>\n&gt; anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Daron<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

In high school I had a<br/>\nrat named Spike, who came to school with me. Our latest rat was Harry<br/>\nPotter (a hooded rat with a white line of fur on his forehead). He was a<br/>\ndomestic rat but we got him from the animal shelter where he had been<br/>\nturned in as a stray... before that my daughter was briefly in the<br/>\nmouse-breeding business, and before that we had a hamster who would run<br/>\naround loose and sleep with the cats (we have oh-so-wimpy cats), and<br/>\nbefore that we had a ferret, who would also run around loose but would<br/>\nchase the cats. <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually like ferrets best, but now we&#39;re in California where they have<br/>\nmisguidedly made them illegal... so we&#39;re thinking of a chinchilla next,<br/>\nalthough my daughter really would prefer to have a rabbit again, I<br/>\nthink...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never really had pets that ended up being hers or mine, they&#39;ve all<br/>\nsort of ended up being family pets... like, Harry was mine, but she would<br/>\nplay with him and hold him while I cleaned the cage and stuff (in his<br/>\ndottage, Harry bit her friend&#39;s finger and blood spurted everywhere, that<br/>\nwas exciting) and I helped with her mice, and she feeds the cats<br/>\nsometimes which have got to be techinically my pets because they&#39;re older<br/>\nthan she is. I guess it just seems easier to me for each of us to do<br/>\nstuff as it needs to be done... I mean, if she was around and I was<br/>\nzipping past the mouse cage and noticed that the water was low, I would<br/>\nmention it to her in passing and expect that when she came to a good<br/>\nstopping place in what she was doing, she&#39;d take care of it... which<br/>\nworked often enough to keep me from feeling put-upon, most of the time<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"HVgi3qNVWqzm-73r4NlucNB_raBHSZuIiA-9V8eesfCaUuPMmDvlrQ6k9d6yb8dE4WvzZZH0Cmz0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets!","postDate":"995243638","msgId":22891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxLjE3YTYwZWMyLjI4ODM5MDc2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22890,"nextInTopic":22892,"prevInTime":22890,"nextInTime":22892,"topicId":22874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry about the premature send before.

We live in the country and I guess the <br/>\nkids figure we have the room. I guess it is a good thing that I like having <br/>\nanimals around too. We have never had rats though I hear they make great <br/>\npets. In the past we have had guinea pigs and gerbils. We loved the guinea <br/>\npigs but not so much the gerbils because they seemed intent on biting us. Now <br/>\nour main pets are Siberean Huskies. It started with my 11 yr old wanting one <br/>\nso he could start a dog team and has grown to all the kids (ages 13, 15, 17) <br/>\njoining in. Now we have 7 huskies. The kids have them pull carts in parades <br/>\nand pull them on scooters for fun. And if we have snow then we have them pull <br/>\na sled too. But there is definitely a lot of chores that go with that many <br/>\ndogs. I just have a rule, chores first. When the kids get up in the morning <br/>\nthe dogs have to be feed and watered. After the kids have breakfast the dog <br/>\npens must be cleaned. In the summer the dogs need to be put in their <br/>\nplay/execise pen early before it gets hot. At first the kids would forget. <br/>\nThey would want to get on the pc or playstation, so I would remind them. I <br/>\ndid not order them to get out there, I would just remind them and off they <br/>\nwould go. Now it has become habit. Of course I am not so stern that there are <br/>\nnot exceptions to the rule. Last night the kids got a call to see if they <br/>\nwould like to help buck bales for a few hours. That meant money so of course <br/>\nthey wanted to go. Since it was spur of the moment and evening chores had not <br/>\nbeen done I said I would do them. To me they are not really chores anyway, I <br/>\nlike to spend time with the dogs too, they are so sweet and each is unique. <br/>\nThe kids were gone till 11:00 last night and anyone who has lifted a hay bale <br/>\nknows how heavy they are and what a job it would be to buck them for 4 hours. <br/>\nSo I took care of chores this morning too so the kids can sleep in. Everyone <br/>\nis different on how they raise their kids and that is great. But here if the <br/>\nkids get a pet then they have to take care of it. I have had good luck with <br/>\nthem doing so with only an occasional reminding. But if they just refused to <br/>\ndo it then I would say no psx, pc, karate classes, etc. I am not going to let <br/>\nanimals suffer because the kids decided they are tired of them. And I am not <br/>\ngoing to take over for them all the time. I do not have that much free time. <br/>\nAnyway, that is what I do here. I am sure that you will find a solution that <br/>\nfits your family. <br/>\nHave a lovely day<br/>\nCandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"LisaBugg","from":"&quot;LisaBugg&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bN1YZo1p2QHseq0w3s2oJjwB5hRuC3E1_VkDEjb-XjtLsZ4vWv6pDeVFb3bM0TKhuJXsn44J18XVzil2gsQll4mSTOQFOp8ZbexcOQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets!","postDate":"995172551","msgId":22876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDUwMWMxMGNlOSQ3ZTc5YTg2MCQ0NjFjOTNhOEBpZm5ldC5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PDNCNTExODZDLjAwMDAwRC41MTAxNUBicm9va2U+"},"prevInTopic":22875,"nextInTopic":22878,"prevInTime":22875,"nextInTime":22877,"topicId":22874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... to ... her ...

You might explain<br/>\nto her that she is their &quot;mommy&quot;.  They will get to know her voice and her<br/>\ntouch and will get to be loyal to her.  Personally, if it were one of my<br/>\nchildren begging for a pet, with a history as you explained, I still<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have let her buy one, even with her own money.  Animals are<br/>\nliving creatures and don&#39;t deserve to be neglected just because their 11<br/>\nyr. old. owner doesn&#39;t feel like dealing with the responsibility anymore. <br/>\nYou may explain to her that neglecting the animals she promised to care<br/>\nfor is just like you neglecting to feed and care for her.  It is your<br/>\nresponsiblity as her mom to care for her.  She knowingly took on these<br/>\nanimals and they are her responsiblity.<br/>\nButtons<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Brooke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BrookeNZ@...\">BrookeNZ@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I need suggestions!
