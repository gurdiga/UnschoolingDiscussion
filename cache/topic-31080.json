This is what I believe it is:  It is a test young <br/>\nadults take if, for one reason or another, they do not attend or finish  <br/>\nhigh school and &quot;earn&quot; a high school diploma.  There are many different <br/>\nreasons for doing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, many people still believe that the only reason a person <br/>\nchooses to take the GED instead of going through high school is because <br/>\nthat kid got kicked out of school, dropped out, or some other &quot;bad&quot; <br/>\nreasons like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the high school I used to work at, there was a GED program.  Most of <br/>\nthe kids in the program were considered to have behavioral problems.  <br/>\nMany had been suspended multiple times from school.  This program was <br/>\nrun like a Boot Camp.  These poor kids had to wear uniforms, were yelled <br/>\nat by teachers, and had to follow much stricter rules than the regular <br/>\nstudent population.  There was even a faculty  meeting held where we <br/>\nwere assured that this group of GED kids would be kept as  separate from <br/>\nthe regular kids and teachers as much as possible.  Their classes were <br/>\nheld in temporary buildings on campus and not in the  main building.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pretty disgusted by the  whole thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it&#39;s programs like this that help keep the negative stigma <br/>\nof the GED going.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the growth of unschooling and homeschooling, however, I really do <br/>\nbelieve this will change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sincerely hope that my boys will be able to stay out of school and <br/>\ntake their GED when, and if, they choose to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
