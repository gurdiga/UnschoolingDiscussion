But it will likely be pretty expensive too. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Regardless, this is a great time to purchase new last generation consoles. We&#39;re in the perfect time where most of the consoles are just about obsolete and makers are clearing them out in anticipation of the next version and people who own the older ones will be selling the consoles and games to make money to buy them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn<br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":172750465,"authorName":"b229d655@cs.com","from":"b229d655@...","profile":"robeyboyz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Choosing Gameboys ?","postDate":"1137086412","msgId":111159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0NC41NDkyZDJmYi4zMGY3ZTljY0Bjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":111155,"nextInTopic":111160,"prevInTime":111158,"nextInTime":111160,"topicId":111155,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/12/2006 11:43:35 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

My 8 year old still <br/>\nhas an SP and loves it, easy to use, etc.  BUT if I were to buy again it would <br/>\nbe the DS as it will allow them to grow into as well.  It has a lot of <br/>\ncapabilities that can be used later.  And all the previous games can be used on it <br/>\ntoo.  So if you have some Gameboy Color games you can use those on the SP or DS.  <br/>\nIf you want fewer bells and whistles, get the SP.  What does your child want <br/>\nit for?  Let them choose.  If they want to have the touch screen cuz they want <br/>\nto interact with say, the Nintendogs, then get that.  The stylus feature is <br/>\ncool too.  But the SP is great for gamers who just want simple and fun games <br/>\nwithout a stylus and all that.  Pop it in your pocket and go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a console, what is your family into?  If your child(ren) enjoy playing <br/>\ntogether and you like bright and fun games-the Gamecube has a better library <br/>\nfor that.  Darker,  more adult type games-Xbox, something that does it all and <br/>\nis backward compatible-meaning it can play games from older <br/>\nsystems-Playstation 2.  They all have great games but some games are exclusive to each system.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family has just begun to get into games (Daddy and I have always played <br/>\nbut now our 4.5 and 8 year old are getting into it too) so it has been a fun, <br/>\nfamily time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227139139,"authorName":"elizabeth roberts","from":"elizabeth roberts &lt;joyfullzoo@...&gt;","profile":"joyfullzoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Choosing Gameboys ?","postDate":"1137078334","msgId":111155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTEyMTUwNTM0LjMxMDU0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111159,"prevInTime":111154,"nextInTime":111156,"topicId":111155,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sarah is wanting a Gameboy.

Her only experience with them is an older Gameboy Color that someone gave her. She&#39;d been asking for the SP I think it is..the game opens like a laptop, only much smaller? But I&#39;m hearing alot of talk about the DS. I&#39;ve been looking online at them, and I&#39;m wondering how difficult the DS might be to learn to play. Is there a way to only use one screen at a time rather than both or is it not quite as difficult to get used to as it seems to me? I myself haven&#39;t had a Gameboy since the Colors came out either. (been awhile, we&#39;re a little behind the times)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We&#39;re also considering purchasing a console. What would be recommended? The GameCube or whatever the latest one is? Is the new one able to play the Game Cube games? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Help!! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks!<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSing, Dance, Laugh...LOVE!<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
