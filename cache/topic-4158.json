I will also be sending it<br/>\nto Walmart<br/>\n&gt; and over time, any other store I learn of that is carrying this<br/>\nso-called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;toy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I learned of this product, (I refuse to call it a toy) from<br/>\nyesterday&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; editorial section of the Atlanta paper, p. G5.  Words simply<br/>\ncannot express<br/>\n&gt; the turmoil I feel after reading it.  The authors make a point<br/>\nabout the<br/>\n&gt; connections between the toy and abuse of women, but it really<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; matter &quot;what kind&quot; of head it is--it&#39;s violence against *people*<br/>\nin the<br/>\n&gt; guise of a plaything.  Playing with heads ripped off bodies just<br/>\nisn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; right.  I could go on and on but at this point would rather keep<br/>\nit short.<br/>\n&gt; Please read the article, carry copies with you to the stores<br/>\nwhen you shop,<br/>\n&gt; speak to managers, email corporates, do what you feel led to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Corporate Officers of Toys R Us:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am writing in response to the article printed in the ATLANTA<br/>\n&gt; JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION of Oct. 31, 1999, p. G5 concerning the WWF<br/>\ntoy &quot;Summer<br/>\n&gt; Slam 99.&quot;  This is a product sold by your stores, and marketed<br/>\nfor children<br/>\n&gt; ages 4 and up.  This &quot;toy&quot; includes, along with the two<br/>\nwrestlers, a<br/>\n&gt; disembodied woman&#39;s head with the words &quot;help me&quot; written on her<br/>\nforehead.<br/>\n&gt;    Simply put, I am appalled and outraged that anyone would<br/>\ndistribute such<br/>\n&gt; a product in a children&#39;s toy store.  I realize the toy is<br/>\ndesigned to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;follow along&quot; with the &quot;story line&quot; of the TV show.  But<br/>\npulling people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; heads off is not children&#39;s play.  As the authors so succintly<br/>\nput it,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What meaning are they (the children) supposed to derive from<br/>\nthis toy?<br/>\n&gt; The most obvious conclusion is that the package contains a<br/>\nfemale victim<br/>\n&gt; who did not survive her encounter with the muscled figures who<br/>\nsurround<br/>\n&gt; her.&quot;  (I do not even care what kind of victim the head is; be<br/>\nwhatever<br/>\n&gt; sex, gender, race, it is wrong).<br/>\n&gt;    I could say more, but words almost fail me.  In the meantime,<br/>\nI will no<br/>\n&gt; longer shop at Toys R Us until this toy is pulled from your<br/>\nshelves.  I<br/>\n&gt; will also be forwarding this letter to every friend and email<br/>\nlist.  We<br/>\n&gt; cannot continue to abide by such irresponsible actions for the<br/>\nsake of<br/>\n&gt; making a dollar.  My children will never see such a toy (or such<br/>\na TV show)<br/>\n&gt; much less play with such, but they are harmed as well by having<br/>\nto grow up<br/>\n&gt; in and live in a world that supports such.  The dollars made<br/>\nfrom such<br/>\n&gt; products are at the expense of all our children.<br/>\n&gt;    I would appreciate a response.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; If you wish to escape RU, send email to<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:majordomo@...\">majordomo@...</a> and in the first line of<br/>\n&gt; the note put: unsubscribe ru<br/>\n&gt; Write to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eric@...\">eric@...</a> if you run into trouble<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2528,"nextTopicId":4174}}
