Any thoughts? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Stephanie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Welcome to posting Stephanie!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rarely encounter arguments about our decisions regarding how Kass & Kree <br/>\n(22 days until they are 12) learn/live. However, just yesterday, while at my <br/>\nMIL&#39;s house for her birthday, Phil&#39;s (DH) cousin went off on some extrordinary <br/>\ntangent about how brainwashed we are to be keeping them out of the system. What <br/>\nwas initiated as a question as to &quot;when&quot; they were going to go to school, <br/>\nfrom the second I said never unless they choose to, the battle began. Luckily, he <br/>\nis one of my favorite relatives, for if he weren&#39;t I am sure my patience <br/>\nwould have worn thin. Instead the dabate lasted a good 4 hours. His issue: the <br/>\ntwins are missing out on experiences!!!??? <br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the four hours, every which way the conversation went, it fell <br/>\nback to experiences. Problem for cousin was, he never did come up with an <br/>\nexperience they were missing, that didn&#39;t equate to a negative. I however, came up <br/>\nwith more than a handful, and at one point when Kass came in and heard the <br/>\ndiscussion, she gave several of her own. Each one we gave was an experience we <br/>\nwould rather not have to deal with, i.e. when to eat, when to go to the bathroom, <br/>\nwhen to talk, when to rest, when to play, when to learn. This unfortunately <br/>\nled the cousin to only get more dispaired in that our kids will never know how <br/>\nto &quot;handle&quot; these situations. As Kass ate chips and dip, before returning to <br/>\nthe pool, Richard said,  &quot;Well you are all brain-washed.&quot; The conversation only <br/>\ngot deeper when Kass exclaimed, &quot;That will be a cold day in hell Uncle <br/>\nRichard! We think for ourselves, that&#39;s the difference.&quot; She was by no means rude or <br/>\ndisrespectful, even though she was offended by a blanket statement about <br/>\nbrainwashing, from a loved one who doesn&#39;t even have children. Richard did ask if <br/>\nwe always &quot;let&quot; them talk that way. He was not pleased when we announced they <br/>\nare &quot;allowed&quot; to say whatever they please, provided they use the words in the <br/>\nproper context. If they use a word improperly, we may give other options and <br/>\nsome may be considered &quot;bad&quot; words. But irregardless, they are still just words.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe evening ended with my MIL, BIL, 2 SIL&#39;s, another CIL and a couple friends <br/>\nall telling Richard, he had no idea what he was talking about and that he is <br/>\nworrying about issues that don&#39;t even exist and may never exist for our <br/>\nfamily. So the argument became mute quite quickly when all my in-laws took our side. <br/>\nIt was almost all I could do not to cry. Not because the argument was heated, <br/>\nbut because Phil&#39;s family &quot;get&#39;s it.&quot; Every one of them gave examples of how <br/>\nmy kids differ from &quot;schooled&quot; kids in all positive ways and one even told <br/>\nRichard, the problem lies in his fears and his own disappointment, that he never <br/>\nhad choices. One friend said what we are doing is nothing short of courageous <br/>\nin a world that tells us we cannot make decisions unless someone else tell us <br/>\nwhat to do or think. The other cousin closed with the argument, that our kids <br/>\nobviously come before everything else, not to mention that we actually like <br/>\neach other. He brought up how anxious his fiance is to send the kids back to <br/>\nschool, because being with them all day is way too hard. He also mentioned that <br/>\nhe only realizes what an odd thing that is when he sees us. <br/>\n<br/>\nRichard went home mad and still not getting it, but it was really wonderful <br/>\nto know that my in-laws back us up. Perhaps because the twins are the only <br/>\ngrandchildren, they see what they wish they had done, but didn&#39;t know was <br/>\navailable to them. I don&#39;t know what will happen when other grandchildren are born, <br/>\nbut the seeds of unschooling have definately been planted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so I went way off about me and mine, but the answer to your question is, <br/>\nfor US, unschooling is perfect. We can&#39;t imagine living any other way and <br/>\nwould never go back to a school mentality. We trust each other & our kids and our <br/>\nfamily trusts us. So we would call that perfect all by itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78000,"nextTopicId":77979}}
