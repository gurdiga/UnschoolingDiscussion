How much research, in reastic settings,<br/>\n&gt; supported the newer approach to math?  (I&#39;m guessing that the NCASM<br/>\n&gt; wrote volumes about this, I&#39;m just looking for something brief and <br/>\n&gt; superficial.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the impetus was that kids weren&#39;t learning under the old traditional <br/>\nmethods.<br/>\nThe NCTM standards involve much high expectations of conceptual understanding <br/>\nand skill development in many more areas than had been previously expected in <br/>\nschools. And it was based on research that had shown that children don&#39;t <br/>\nlearn best by being &quot;taught&quot; or by rote drill - but learn best by <br/>\nconstructing their own understanding through investigation and invention and <br/>\ncollaboration and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a ton of research - Constance Kamii is one of the leading <br/>\nresearchers in this area - look under &quot;constructivist mathematics.&quot; A lot of <br/>\nresearch is probably published in: Journal for Research in Mathematics <br/>\nEducation which is the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) <br/>\nresearch journal. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry this article - it is in pdf and takes a while to load, longer than you <br/>\nprobably wanted, but is readable and very informative about research and the <br/>\nNCTM standards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.nctm.org/eresources/view_media.asp?article_id=68\">http://my.nctm.org/eresources/view_media.asp?article_id=68</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39383,"nextTopicId":39558}}
