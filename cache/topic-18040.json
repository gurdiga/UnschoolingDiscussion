Is she \nwithdrawn? Have you reassured her of your love? She may feel like she betrayed \nyou. Does your son realize how unfair his question was? Why did he ask her that \nin the first place? Do you still notice the mood swing periods since you have \nbeen homeschooling? Does she communicate her feelings&nbsp;much when she seems \ndown? Maybe you could keep a mood journal of sorts and see&nbsp;if you notice a \npattern or&nbsp;possibly something that triggers her moods. What you have \ndescribed reminds me of my sister growing up. She had her teddy bear, which she \nstill has. I can understand being anxious about the medical community. I think \nthey used my sister like a guinea pig, trying different things to see what \nworked. Many caused more damage than good. Learn all you can before you let any \ndoctor medicate her. I wish I had some easy answers, but all I can offer is the \nsympathy of a mother who understands how much this situation must make you hurt. \nI&#39;m sure you&nbsp;will pursue whatever you find that will help your \ndaughter.&nbsp;My prayers will go with you.</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Johanna&nbsp; </font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17946,"nextTopicId":18029}}
