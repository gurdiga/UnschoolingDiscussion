There was no<br/>\n&gt;blaming - just figuring out what was happening and  what to do about it. I<br/>\n&gt;remember, once, my mom just totally lost her temper with my youngest sister<br/>\n&gt;(who was about 5 or so) and she grabbed her by the arm and started to swing<br/>\n&gt;one hand like she was going to swat her bottom. Totally freaked my sisters<br/>\n&gt;and me out to see her do that. But at the last minute she didn&#39;t do it -<br/>\n&gt;she avoided actually hitting her - and she hit her hand on the underside of<br/>\n&gt;our couch and broke a bone in a finger. She always said that she&#39;d deserved<br/>\n&gt;it, to lose her temper like that and ever think of striking a child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So - what happens to kids who are never spanked, shamed, punished?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We&#39;re all fine, happily married with great children of our own and not one<br/>\n&gt;of us ever ever has spanked any of our children and none of us &quot;punish&quot; our<br/>\n&gt;children either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My mother died this week.
