It took us<br/>\n<br/>\nan hour by plane. It takes us 11 hours by car. We had 5 more hours to get to<br/>\n<br/>\nCalifornia. Kathryn, who was 10 at the time, said &quot;Do you know how long it<br/>\n<br/>\nwould take to drive to California? It would take 66 hours.&quot; *That&#39;s*<br/>\n<br/>\nalgebraic thinking. (Which someone neatly described as using what you know<br/>\n<br/>\nto figure out what you don&#39;t know.) The context of the problem supplied the<br/>\n<br/>\nsense of how the numbers needed to be manipulated. Her curiosity supplied<br/>\n<br/>\nthe desire to manipulate them. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCREEPY CREEPY!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly was asking how long it would take to drive to Florida.  I <br/>\nsaid four days (taking into consideration stopping and sleeping, and not <br/>\ndriving like a truckdriver).  How long would it take to drive to California <br/>\n(by which she meant &quot;Disneyland&quot;).  I said &quot;two drivers, not stopping? one <br/>\nday&quot;  meaning there within 24 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yesterday I was thinking (without mentioning it to Holly) of Boston.  She <br/>\nhad said &quot;We should go on a road trip,&quot; and I was doing something else and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say anything but said &quot;Boston.&quot;  And she saw a panel van with a little <br/>\nwindow in the back, on the side (like a full-size Chevy without side windows) <br/>\nand said &quot;We should get one of those for trips!&quot;  I said it&#39;s not fun, I had <br/>\nridden to Pennsylvania and back in the back of a windowless van.  Hot and <br/>\nboring.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my most obvious algebra story has to do with allowance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid my allowance was 35 cents for a while.  The paperback books <br/>\nI was reading that season cost 50 cents.  (Doc Savage books.  Weird.)  So my <br/>\nmath had to do with two weeks, one book, four candy bars.  Boring and <br/>\ninsufficient for my needs.  But I still to this day know with no thought that <br/>\n70 cents is divisible by 35 and that $1.05 is three weeks&#39; allowance at that <br/>\nlong-ago rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are aware of the others&#39; allowance rates.  It&#39;s 75 cents per year of <br/>\nage per week.  A ten year old gets $7.50, and there was a second wave <br/>\nSchoolhouse Rock video about &quot;$7.50 once a week&quot; that Holly saw when she was <br/>\nten.  That was cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they have over the years calmly, efficiently and correctly calculated how <br/>\nlong it would take any one of them, or two or three of them together, to buy <br/>\nthis or that.  And how much more quickly they could save a given amount if <br/>\nthey were a year older.  Marty is especially quick at it.  We&#39;ve never <br/>\nstopped them and shown them any algebraic notation to go with it.  Someday <br/>\nwhen someone does, they will get it immediately, without any hesitition or <br/>\nbafflement, because it will be the writing system of a language with which <br/>\nthey are already familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby doesn&#39;t claim his allowance regularly because he has a job.  It goes on <br/>\nthe calendar each Sunday like an oldtime passbook.  When he needs a lump of <br/>\nmoney he &quot;withdraws allowance,&quot; but the goal is to save for the anime <br/>\nconvention in Denver in fall.  This will be the third year that is his method <br/>\nof savings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly sometimes goes to calendar, but often takes it and keeps it herself.   <br/>\nShe is the person most likely in this family to be able to change a $20 or to <br/>\nlend someone $10.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen Kirby&#39;s wallet, and Marty&#39;s.  They usually have a little money, <br/>\nand their wallets are immaculately organized.  I&#39;m impressed.   Their dad&#39;s <br/>\nis too.  I guess it&#39;s genetic.  I would use a wallet if I didn&#39;t lose them  <br/>\nso easily.  I use little manila envelopes that fit into a jeans pocket, and I <br/>\ncan write on the outside when I use the debit card and for how much, and I <br/>\ncan note appointments and phone numbers, and then get a new envelope when <br/>\nit&#39;s full or I&#39;ve spent $200.  That&#39;s a kind of algebra problem too, mixed <br/>\nwith other matters.  But the best parts of life are mixed matters!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53549,"nextTopicId":54463}}
