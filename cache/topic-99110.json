They <br/>\nlooked so cute and I was so sad to see them go then came Nicholas....and Cameron&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past week after the convention I was on my Holt kick again. I bought <br/>\n&quot;What Do I Do Monday&quot; and a 1964 &quot;How Children Fail&quot; for 7.00 on Ebay. I dont <br/>\nneed them but I wanted to have them to read and thought how cool to have some of <br/>\nhis older books/versions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also was moving books and stumbled upon a 1938 &quot;The Little American Girl&quot; <br/>\nbook that I may not need but thought again gee this is a very old book I think <br/>\nI&#39;ll hold this for a while. Maybe its the old version of the American Girl <br/>\nbooks and some family may think its pretty neat someday. Then there is the <br/>\nGymdandy that I found last week (3 seat seesaw from the 70&#39;s) that I plan to <br/>\nrefinish for the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have many, many toys in every room. Having four kids I dont want them <br/>\nto feel they didn&#39;t have things of their own. For example we have 3 pedal <br/>\ncars, 2 cozy coups, 3 scooters, 3 wagons, 2 swing sets (outside thank goodness) <br/>\nand boxes and boxes of trucks,dolls,blocks and more blocks and bigger blocks. <br/>\nBarbies, houses, people, a large box of fast food toys and a lot of VCR <br/>\ntapes..... My home is much too full and i would be happier with less stuff (I think) <br/>\nbut they wouldn&#39;t be. (most of the above items were given to us)<br/>\n<br/>\nIts nearly impossible to keep this place uncluttered and Ive pretty much <br/>\ngiven up on worrying what my mother would say (she moved to SC anyway). As a child <br/>\nmy Mom was a neat freak and still is. She has wasted years cleaning to the <br/>\npoint of madness and misery. I think I went the other way just because it made <br/>\nme so sad that cleaning was more important than playing with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are my (4) kids going to say as adults? Mom I hate you because you <br/>\nplayed with me and didn&#39;t spend hours picking up the same stuff over and over <br/>\nagain.. I dont think so. They know I pick up I just dont say im sorry I cant <br/>\nplay/go/do because you/I made this mess and I need to pick it up. Ive been known to <br/>\nleave the house and a trail behind me it will be there when we get back. Shut <br/>\nthe door and enter sunshine :)<br/>\nSo that said, if any who live near me come to visit my home is not free from <br/>\nblocks, cars and toys in every room.

A friend of my mine had a whole box of toys to give to her son when he was born that she had played with. Some were from her mom and dad when they were kids.  It made me sad that I don&#39;t have hardly anything left from my childhood because my mom would throw or give everything away, not one blanket, toy, art project, card I made, nothing I would of like to have.  I got one box when they sold their house.  It had some meaningless twirling trophies and a couple of ribbons and crowns from pageants that I did when I was little.  Nothing that meant a thing to me, but clearly these were important to my mom, so she kept them.  She did save a box of books for us and I have enjoyed reading those to my son.  He can keep whatever he wants.  Periodically, we go through his stuff looking for items he doesn&#39;t want anymore.  He has a roomful of toys, but still plays with some of his baby things.  I have also saved some of his clothes and toys for him (and me).  I think my mom is understanding now a little bit.  When my grandmother died recently, she called me and asked what would I like to have as a keepsake.  She picked out quite a few things and brought them to me.  Things that really remind me of my grandmother.  My mom just really hates clutter and her stepmom kept everything.  So, I think it must skip a generation or something. Probably from a need created by the prior generation.

For me, in that situation, it was so much easier <br/>\nto be focused on checking items off than feeling overwhelmed, being <br/>\nmad (at whom?) for having to do it by myself, etc. Now it&#39;s...not a <br/>\nroutine, but a rhythm that works for me.

I am the only one who enjoys getting rid<br/>\nof stuff and living with minimal stuff.  (And I&#39;ve rarely ever wanted<br/>\nanything back that I threw out.) What I have done is to have two smaller<br/>\ncontainers upstairs for paper stuff that is saved.  (one for each kid) and<br/>\nwhen it is full, I move it to plastic bags, date it, and put it in those big<br/>\nRubbermaid buckets and date them and when they are full, put them in the<br/>\nbasement closet.  We are going to build shelves, some day, to stack those<br/>\nbuckets on so we can fit them floor to ceiling in the basement closet, which<br/>\nis quite large.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf something is debatable when it comes to throwing it out.  Like a gum<br/>\nwrapper that is really a horse leg wrap, or something.  I put it in the<br/>\npantry on a shelf and if someone asks for it, I find it.  If no one asks for<br/>\nit in a couple of days, then I throw it out.  My kids even save cereal<br/>\nboxes.  I let them play with them until they are bored with them, they move<br/>\nto the shelf and if no one asks for it in a few days, I throw it out.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI feel like I am meeting my needs to not live in a house filled with trash<br/>\nand I am meeting their needs to allow them to play with stuff till they&#39;ve<br/>\nhad their fill.  It is a compromise because they wouldn&#39;t actually choose to<br/>\nthrow away the cereal boxes ever and I would choose to throw them out<br/>\nimmediately. When they ask if they can have a cereal box when it&#39;s empty, I<br/>\nmake sure I say, you can have it to play with for a while.  It&#39;s so hard<br/>\nhaving kids who don&#39;t want to part with anything.

THAT is my big<br/>\nproblem way of seeing things - I see it all as one HUGE big mess to<br/>\nclean up and I&#39;m not satisfied if I get a bit done.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought maybe that might be part of it.  Earlier you were writing <br/>\nabout 3 scenarios of being busy --  being late for a scheduled event, <br/>\nrunning out the door for park day, and having your husband waiting for <br/>\nyou to join him to watch a movie on TV.  When I read the post, I was <br/>\nthinking that in case (b) and case (c) it was theoretically possible to <br/>\nspend 5 or 8 minutes cleaning before starting the next activity.  <br/>\nBecause I still believe (down deep in my heart, somewhere) that <br/>\nincremental activity can make a difference.  But if incremental activity <br/>\nis unsatisfying for you, then that&#39;s not the way to go.  (I do a lot of <br/>\nthings incrementally because I have a very short attention span and I <br/>\nfind it a huge struggle to try and stick with something until it is <br/>\ncompletly done.  And I mean often I start unloading the dishwasher and <br/>\ndon&#39;t finish.)<br/>\n<br/>\n**And I&#39;m ONLY going to do it when I feel like it**<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is good.  And like any unhappy thing that we might tend to <br/>\ndwell on, you could maybe use the technique of scheduling your negative <br/>\nthoughts.  When you catch yourself thinking unhappy thoughts about the <br/>\nhousework, you might try telling yourself (firmly) that noon on Monday <br/>\nis your scheduled time for thinking about how to clean or how to <br/>\ndeclutter and that thoughts on the subject can darn well come back at <br/>\nthat time for you to address them constructively.  (I&#39;m stealing a <br/>\ntechnique that I used for awhile for scheduling worrying about money.  <br/>\nThere are some problems that we can&#39;t completely ignore or minimize, but <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean we should consent to let them drape themselves around <br/>\nour necks and oppress us all the time.)  (If you need to physically get <br/>\naway from the clutter, you might try just spiffing up a bathroom or <br/>\npatio and hide out there when you need respite from the irritations of <br/>\nclutter.  Or start a list of enjoyable passtimes that you can do with <br/>\nyour eyes closed &lt;eg&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDid anyone talk much yet about hiring help?  Is that financially or <br/>\nemotionally unappealing?<br/>\n<br/>\n**I totally see how the<br/>\nkids doing what they are interested in works, I see that doing<br/>\nsomething resentfully is a TERRIBLE disincentive for children, and I<br/>\nknow for sure how feeling like they &quot;should&quot; do something, and then<br/>\nshirking on doing it, builds up a vicious circle of guilt and<br/>\nresentment.**<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  Even possibly when pay is involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep thinking there is some way to make some kind of economic game out <br/>\nof divvying up housework.  Because clearly people vary in which tasks <br/>\nthey dislike most.  There&#39;s got to be some optimum way to get tasks done <br/>\nwhile minimizing human inconvenience.  I also think that the idea of <br/>\npaper snippets on the floor and pollution tax credits are somehow <br/>\nlinked.

I&#39;ve learned to circumvent<br/>\nfrustration on my part and obligation/embarassment/shame/hiding/sneaky<br/>\nbehavior on my 6yo childs part by reminding her when she brings messy food<br/>\ninto a room other than the kitchen the following...&quot;if it spills call me<br/>\nquickly and i&#39;ll help clean it up so that it doesn&#39;t leave a sticky mess.&quot;<br/>\nAnd I DO this with smile on my face, just as I did when she learned to walk<br/>\nor when she was trying to understand a new word or if she needed help<br/>\nreading a new word or wiping her butt. I will help her carry something into<br/>\nanother room if i think she&#39;ll have trouble carrying it without spilling.<br/>\nAnd when she eats in another room, if i am concerned about the carpet or<br/>\nfurniture,  i lay down a drop cloth (old towel) under her plate or bowl<br/>\nfirst.   If my older dd leaves something behind or clothes on floor I&#39;ll ask<br/>\nher when she&#39;s leaving the room if she would bring it into the other room.<br/>\nShe seems to easily recognize the choice in my request and will do it if she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s taken me a while to find joy in cleaning. I&#39;ve never been a neat/clean<br/>\nperson and am not a natural &#39;homemaker&#39; type.  Like Pam, I qualify as the<br/>\nartist/organizer/social type of person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to hate/resent washing dishes (we don&#39;t have dishwasher). Why was it<br/>\nmy job when everyone ate? (Specifically my dh)  I&#39;ve learned to only wash<br/>\nwhen i feel like it.  Gee he&#39;s not percieved as a slob (as i&#39;ve felt like i<br/>\nam) and he doesn&#39;t seem to do it unless he wants to.  Yes that means that<br/>\nthere may be dishes in the sink in the morning when i get up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf i begin to feel the slightest resentment in washing a dish or picking up<br/>\ntoys or putting away crafts, books, clothes, garbage, etc.  I stop.  If I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do it now i won&#39;t.  Once i really gave myself permission to<br/>\nNOT HAVE to clean cleaning became a helluva lot easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to put on some really good music.  I will clean to the drum<br/>\nbeat of Gabrielle Roth or the jam of some good old fashion rock n<br/>\nroll...punk rock can get me rockin as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Be facinated by your hand, if you&#39;re not who will be &quot; was a statement made<br/>\nby Gabrielle Roth.  This has allowed me to really enjoy washing dishes and<br/>\nfind the meditative peacefulness in the activity.  How can I not enjoy an<br/>\nactivity that allows me the opportunity to appreciate myself/mybody?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the greatest freedoms i&#39;ve felt in my life was when I realized i<br/>\nwasn&#39;t cleaning for my mother.

I think I will have a &quot;family meeting&quot; and ask the<br/>\n&gt; kids what they think we could do to make cleaning fun.  If we all<br/>\n&gt; come up with some fun and silly ideas, I think that would really help<br/>\n&gt; to change everyone&#39;s attitude toward cleaning in general, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d get my own needs met too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve given up the idea of making cleaning &quot;fun&quot;.

I much prefer that my house be<br/>\na mess and my children be in order, than the other way around.  So I look at<br/>\nmy family&#39;s attitude toward cleaning ~ NONE of the adults in my local family<br/>\nclean, ALL require it of their children and/or cleaning lady.  My house is<br/>\nactually on the clean side of the scale and it&#39;s sometimes a harrowing trip<br/>\nthru the living room ~ past the happy laughing children, the lego<br/>\nsculptures, drawings and newspapers (and now compounded by vacation schtuff<br/>\nthat has yet to find a home).  What does cleaning look like in my house?  A<br/>\npissy, grumpy, grumbling mommy from whom the children scatter like<br/>\nchickens... who&#39;d wanna help me?  who&#39;d want THAT job?  If picking up the<br/>\nhouse means a bad attitude, my children (and me for that matter) would<br/>\nrather take their happy attitude right out of the house, as far from me as<br/>\npossible.
