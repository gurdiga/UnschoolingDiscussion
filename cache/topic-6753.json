I was taling with a friend about this yesterday (it really got under my skin and I&#39;ve been ranting to anyone who&#39;ll listen (including this captive audience :-) ) and she said that she turns into a teenager when she goes to her mother&#39;s and I suppose it&#39;s a bit the same, that I sit back because she&#39;s my mum.  I have an awful feeling that if I said anything it would turn into a slanging match (like the merits of taking dietary advice from someone who&#39;s a size 32 (different in the US, but you get the idea...) and she spends enought time with us to know what behaviour I expect, I don&#39;t think she can believe that someone raised the way I was can think that there is a minimum standard of behaviour.  But anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I suppose I need to try, it&#39;s hard going up against your own though, don&#39;t you think?
