As I said, we attend a Mennonite church,<br/>\nwhich we started going to about five years ago.  One thing I thought was<br/>\nvery interesting about them is they only school their children to the 8th or<br/>\n10th grades, depending on the families, then they apprentence them.  The<br/>\nboys go to work with their fathers, or another man in the church who does<br/>\nsomething they are interested in.  The girls go home and are taught by their<br/>\nmothers how to run a home (I know, I know some of you won&#39;t agree with that,<br/>\nlet&#39;s just agree to disagree!!).  So after my son had completed the 8th<br/>\ngrade, I left him on his own to learn, esp. to work on his art, since he<br/>\nhopes he will be able to make a living with that.  (unschooling?)  He has<br/>\nlearned so much more in this time than what we had done before.  I came in<br/>\none day and he was laying on his bed reading an economics book left over<br/>\nfrom when his sisters were schooling.<br/>\nOne thing I will say about the books you have bought, Tami, keep buying<br/>\nthem.  There have been books I bought that weren&#39;t touched for years, then<br/>\nanother child found them on the bookshelf and got them out to read.  I don&#39;t<br/>\never get rid of  any kind of school books.<br/>\n Also have you seen the &quot;Keepers At Home&quot;  unit study ?  Your daughter might<br/>\nbe interested in that.  It teaches all kinds of old fashioned skills, like<br/>\nknitting, crocheting, candle making, sewing, care of the elderly, herbs,<br/>\ncomforting the greiving, giving birth...  It&#39;s an amazing book.  My little<br/>\ngirl, the only one at home, will only be four this week, but I bought it<br/>\nbecause there were so many things I wanted to learn.<br/>\nCarla Raley<br/>\nJacksboro, Texas<br/>\nAs for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

After removing my then 11yr old from school we did<br/>\n&gt; school at home and moved onto unschooling because it didnt work.<br/>\n&gt; For 4 months my dd has been deschooling - I waited and waited and<br/>\n&gt; waited for something to happen....becoming more and more desperate.<br/>\n&gt; Suggesting things - starting things - but all she wanted to do was<br/>\n&gt; watch TV.  I bought a mathwork book. (This is the only structured<br/>\n&gt; thing I insisted she do)......and waited.<br/>\n&gt; Toni is a night owl and a late riser. I am the opposite and I found<br/>\n&gt; this hard to handle - but I allowed her body clock to take over.  I<br/>\n&gt; learned not to nag.  I also learned that Toni is at her best late<br/>\n&gt; afternoon and early evening - I also found that she works better with<br/>\n&gt; noise.......<br/>\n&gt; Toni did 5 pages of math yesterday while watching TV and got most of<br/>\n&gt; them right!! This is happening more and more.  She has several e-pals<br/>\n&gt; who she now correspondces with several times a week - before i used<br/>\n&gt; to TELL her to answere these emails and she would leave them - Now<br/>\n&gt; that i leave her to her own device as far as *school* goes, we get<br/>\n&gt; much more done.<br/>\n&gt; So dont give up.  These lovely people on these message boards kept<br/>\n&gt; telling me it *would happen* - I didnt believe them!!!!
