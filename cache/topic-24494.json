(However, if people hate the type<br/>\nof advice dished out here, I think they should *consider* leaving, instead of<br/>\ntrying to reshape the list to give them the advice they prefer.  This list<br/>\nalready exists and satisfies the needs of scores of people.  There are hundreds<br/>\nof homeschooling lists out there.  This one doesn&#39;t need to contort itself into<br/>\ndifferent shapes to please every potential list member.  I&#39;m not trying to<br/>\nforce anyone to leave.  It&#39;s up to every individual to decide if it&#39;s worth<br/>\nher/his time to be on this list.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all unschool differently, but if people want to be really different about<br/>\nit, and unschool in a way that has some similarities to school at home, then<br/>\nI&#39;d like to ask for one thing.  That is, IF you have an unsuccessful<br/>\nexperience, please don&#39;t say that you tried unschooling and it didn&#39;t work.  If<br/>\nyou want the right to homeschool in your own unique way, please say &quot;we tried<br/>\nhomeschooling in our own unique way and it didn&#39;t work&quot;.  (Again, this is only<br/>\nIF you run into problems.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I think there might be problems?  Because I believe it is the freedom<br/>\nfrom compulsion that allows unschooled kids to really excell in their chosen<br/>\nareas.  Compulsion, in public school, produces a strong aversion for learning.<br/>\nThere are a lot of kids that come out of school HATING math, or poetry or<br/>\nhistory.  I&#39;m not sure that even tiny bits of compulsion are desirable when it<br/>\ncomes to promoting learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FTEj47H8puS_LIopQQvpWA7lYZUubGyUTnz840i4BWkRpLSOeVEq7FDliDsMi9s2VGScxoxcEpfl","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1419","postDate":"999954716","msgId":24532,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MC44NmI2MWIuMjhjYjczMWNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24524,"nextInTopic":24713,"prevInTime":24531,"nextInTime":24533,"topicId":24494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 09/08/2001 4:49:26 AM !!!First Boot!!!, ...
