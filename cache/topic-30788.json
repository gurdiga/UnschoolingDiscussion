Admittedly, my own needs oft times do <br/>\nget placed on the back burner.  It is a good thing I am not an overly needy <br/>\nperson!  As someone else mentioned elsewhere on this list, the kids stay <br/>\nsmall for such a short  season.  I am willing to roll with it - but then, <br/>\ntoday is a GOOD day!  lol<br/>\n<br/>\nBy nature, I am a meticulous person.  I like things &#39;in order&#39; and done &#39;my <br/>\nway&#39;, in the home.  Out of necessity however, the Lord has made some changes <br/>\nin me as the demands (with a capital &#39;d&#39;) of our household have increased.  <br/>\nNow, while I still like things in order around here, I have become more <br/>\n&#39;relaxed&#39; and more willing to be attentive and open to the &#39;eb and flow&#39; of <br/>\nour household.  This applies to home learning, too.  If something important <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get done, we&#39;ll try again tomorrow.  Thank heaven for - TOMORROWS!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also fortunately, the high energy type.  There is NEVER a dull moment <br/>\naround here.  However, I know what it is to be sleep depraved, too.  No <br/>\nlaughing matter.  I say, just hang in there and this season shall pass, too.  <br/>\nPerhaps even as soon as in just a few days...  My suggestion when you have <br/>\nbeen so ill as of late would be - put all else aside and just get some rest.  <br/>\nThere is no need afterall to fully sap yourself over school and house <br/>\ncleaning or anything else.  Just take a deep breath and relax.  Sounds like <br/>\nyou need an in-home vacation - some R & R.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, are you blessed to have any older children who could help with simple <br/>\nneeds around the house, especially in this hard time of yours?  This to me is <br/>\nto be termed &#39;basic life training&#39; in our home.  The kids here mean ALOT when <br/>\nit comes to the little details around the house - especially when mom is out <br/>\nof commission for what ever reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the sake of encouragement...<br/>\n~ Lisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30782,"nextTopicId":30791}}
