We used a room in the library once a week for about 2 hours.

My opinion was that if the daughter knew that stuff, then why did she have to keep doing it?  I tried to figure out why the mom would bring math to a game group.

I was uneasy about possible reactions to my decision to<br/>\nunschool as most of families are fundamental Christians. I have been so<br/>\namazed at the  positive response. We have had a couple of meetings (we all<br/>\ngo out to dinner) and everyone has been really interested and asked lots of<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince February, one family has begun unschooling and another has thrown out<br/>\nher timetable and is trying really hard to give her kids more freedom. My<br/>\nnewsletter has much more of an unschooling feel to it (obviously) and<br/>\neveryone has been enjoying that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess just being positive and excited about what you&#39;re doing does have an<br/>\nimpact on people. It is interesting though, out of 15 or so families I can<br/>\nonly think of one that is a strict school at home type who can&#39;t do anything<br/>\ntill after 1pm. Maybe it&#39;s an Australian thing. The &#39;she&#39;ll be right mate&#39;<br/>\ntype attitude that makes for a pretty laid back life.

Unfortunately, there is not an unschooling group in our area.   <br/>\nJust Pam G and I.. and one other mother.. We&#39;ve met a few other unschoolers <br/>\nthat live within an hour or so of us..  Anyway, most of the hs&#39;ers in our group <br/>\nare strict school at homers.   They can&#39;t do anything til after 1:00..  Can&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;miss&quot; too many school days.. They have to make everything a lesson, quiz <br/>\nthier kids on it.. ughghghg.. BUT, we are planning on trying to make the best of <br/>\nit and come up with some fun ideas for clubs, outings,  whatever. .. Any ideas <br/>\nfor what has worked well in your local groups?<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77764,"nextTopicId":77784}}
