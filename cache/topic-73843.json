If you can t find any, or if","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-829792322\">&lt;&lt;Like the mini desks<br/>\nidea..&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy,<br/>\n<br/>\nI found my lap desks at a resale shop.  They were a hard top with a bean bag <br/>\ntype bottom.  If you can&#39;t find any, or if they are too expensive, here are <br/>\nsome other ideas:<br/>\n<br/>\nA small dry-erase board or chalkboard.  Gives them something to do as well <br/>\nas a hard surface for other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomemade lap desks are easy with a few tools, I&#39;ve made these for my kids.  <br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to make them for anyone who wants one, too! (Shameless plug!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy a piece of wood, cheap particle board works fine.  With spray adhesive, <br/>\ncover it on one side with wallpaper, wrapping paper, contact paper, fabric, <br/>\nanything you have will work.  If you want a soft side, cut out a piece or <br/>\npieces, depending on how thick you want it, of batting to cover the back, <br/>\ncut a piece of fabric large enough to cover the batting and sides.  Staple <br/>\nthe fabric in place around the baord edges and cover with trim.  You can <br/>\neither staple or glue the trim on, depending on how clean you want the edges <br/>\nto look.  For the hard side, you can also spray it with chalkboard paint if <br/>\nyou&#39;d like.  I&#39;ve done this, too and it works out great!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideas are endless!  We&#39;ve used felt on one side for felt play....great <br/>\nfor car rides...and made homemade felt people and such before going out of <br/>\ntown.  I&#39;ve made them in secret and broken them out on the car ride for a <br/>\nfun, new surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I did on some of my boards was use an old tin can, veggie, <br/>\netc., and covered it in fabric to make it pretty.  I cut out a hole in the <br/>\nlap desks for a tight fit and stuck it in the hole, sunk in only about an <br/>\ninch or two, depending on the back surface of my board, and glued it in <br/>\nplace.  Usually you can get a tight fit without needing glue.  In this we <br/>\nplaced their drawing supplies, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tape recorder can be fun if you don&#39;t mind the noise.  My kids love taping <br/>\nsilly sounds and playing them back.  Once, we sang songs onto the tape and <br/>\nplayed it back to sing to ourselves in rounds.  THAT was a LOT of fun!  We <br/>\nalso sang silly made-up songs about things we saw on the way.  It is fun to <br/>\ngo back and listen to those tapes of our trip to AK.  Many of them have <br/>\nrunning commentary of what we were seeing which is really neat.  I secretly <br/>\ntaped a lot of our conversations and love going back and listening to <br/>\nthem...and how tiny they all sound!!!  The kids think those tapes are really <br/>\nneat!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe bought some Colorforms and I found some window decals on clearance and <br/>\nthe kids liked sticking those to the car windows and making scenes and such. <br/>\n  With so many kids, of course we had to stop and seat swap so everyone got <br/>\na turn but it worked out really well for us.  Try the dollar stores as they <br/>\ntend to have out of date things for really cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent nearly an entire day before our trip cutting out pictures from <br/>\nmagazines and such and placed them in a recipe box.  Obviously you would <br/>\nhave to find small pictures or cut larger ones up into small pieces.  On the <br/>\ntrip, I gave the kids glue sticks and construction paper and they had a ball <br/>\npasting their pictures onto paper.  By cutting out ahead of time, we <br/>\neliminated the need for scissors in the car.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did bark and leaf rubbings in the car too.  On our pitstops, we grabbed <br/>\nvarious flowers, leaves, bark, etc and once back on the road, the kids did <br/>\nrubbings with crayons.  Haleigh, the only one really old enough at that <br/>\ntime, used a field guide to locate what she had found in nature and gave <br/>\neach item a name in pretty letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere, I have a running list of great ideas we have tried and come up <br/>\nwith for things to do in the car.  If I can find it, or if I come up with <br/>\nanything else, I&#39;ll let you know!<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  One last thing.  Give everyone a backpack or something similar to store <br/>\ntheir own things in.  It&#39;s so much better for them each to have their own <br/>\nthings and a safe place to keep them!  If each child has a seat in front of <br/>\nthem, you can hang a simple bag on the back of the seat in front of them or <br/>\neven make a flat piece of canvas with various pockets to store things in.  <br/>\nIf you can swing it in your behicle, this is the way to go!  I&#39;ve made <br/>\nseveral of these and my kids adore them!
