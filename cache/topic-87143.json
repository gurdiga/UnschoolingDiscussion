I did have some beef fat just the other day and was holding on to it for something similar then someone chucked it. I used...black sunflower seeds and niger seed. I&#39;ve heard most of the mixed feed you buy is usless filler for the birds. I did not know what you mentioned about the Xmas tree however and I think we&#39;ll change our plans. I do have a commercial suet thingee out front and of course, if the seed mixes are mostly filler, my suet thingee likely will be too. <br/>\n      Anyhow...mostly you&#39;ve made me realize I should read up a little more. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n      Thank you for the info- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1160699,"authorName":"Penn Acres","from":"&quot;Penn Acres&quot; &lt;pennacres@...&gt;","profile":"mtnsky2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Christmas Tree idea--LONG","postDate":"1072816649","msgId":87143,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWMzY2YxNCRkYWYzOWQ0MCQzZWUwYjVkMEBHcmFjZVBlbm4+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWMzY2VlMCQyYmE2ZTU2MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBuZXc+IDwwMDgyMDFjM2NlZjEkZTI1ZDQ3NzAkZmE4MGVlNDBAeW91cm8wa3drdzlqd2M+IDwwMDJkMDFjM2NlZmUkY2YxNmQxNjAkN2Y0Y2RlMThAYW9sZHNsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":87150,"prevInTime":87142,"nextInTime":87144,"topicId":87143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Using your own real tree as a birdfeeder sounds and looks pretty. You might want to consider the following. Using straight peanut butter with the seeds","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-511001620\">Using your own real tree as a birdfeeder sounds and looks pretty. You might want to consider the following.<br/>\nUsing straight peanut butter with the seeds  apparently can   cause problems with small birds being unable to swallow it or get it off of their beaks . I f it is used really thinly it is probably  fine.  Using  melted  beef suet  and adding  a few spoonfuls of peanut butter and then adding or sprinkling on the seeds has been advised.<br/>\nBags of ground suet (ground beef fat) is often obtainable at this time of year in the meat case  of your grocery store as it is a main ingredient in christmas steamed puddings. It melts easily in the microwave as you would melt margarine.<br/>\nI have not been able to find it at other times of the season any more. <br/>\nWe also  have used the commercial suet cakes-I am mistrustful of them a bit. If I lived closer to a &quot;wild bird store&quot; i would have a look at theirs.<br/>\nOccasionally we are able to get chunks of animal fat and nail it to a board or  hang in a mesh onion bag.<br/>\nWe also use large cones and pour on the suet mix and pour on seeds right away.<br/>\nI really hope your tree attracts some birds, it is so neat. I think- &quot;i am sort of a &quot;bird nut&quot; The binoculars and bird books sit on  the window sill by my chair all year round and  a pair and books in the van. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany commercial trees are sprayed with a &quot;dessicant&quot; to prevent some drying out. also many are sprayed with fungisides  and pest sprays. Presumably all are  &quot;safe&#39;. We have notices that even the  trees we have purchased from a very small christmas tree-u-cut  farm down  the road a few miles seemed  to have  a powdery substance that made my husband cough while he was crawling around in it last year. this year I forgot to phone and ask before they went for the tree and only thought about it when  we took it down yesterday. My husband said it didnt bother him at all and he didnt see or smell anything. Perhaps it was  an actual powdery mildew last year. <br/>\nI worry about  any extra tinsel on the tree-getting wrapped around their legs. we used to put  our &quot;bush cut  trees&quot; out with bird seed cones  on  years ago and I was  really careful about getting it all off but now I am not so we throw it onto the &quot;burning pile&quot;  until spring<br/>\n.We often have chickens and they are notorious for getting pieces of bag string  tangled on  their  feet when they scratch around.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur hanging cones attract chickadees-(black capped and mountain )  nuthatches, and downy woodpeckers.<br/>\nthey are in a large bush pussy willow outside my kitchen windows.<br/>\nWe have four other bird feeders that we use black oil sunflower seed in  daily that always have the above birds<br/>\nplus flocks of evening grosbeaks (smaller group this year) sometimes there  are 20 or more-the &quot;piggys&quot; of the bird feeder world. We have gorgeous raspberry pink (the males)  pine grosbeaks more abundantly this year . juncos-who actually usually show up more towards the end of spring  but I think got &quot;trapped&quot; here with the early heavy snow -they scrabble around in the feeders looking for  broken bits of sunflower kernals. Being  &quot;ground feeders:. I did buy a big bag of mixed small seed this year , more for them but they will have to eat it in the feeders as it is too dangerous for them to feed on it  on  the ground  under the spruce  trees  with our cats.  We go through about 4 -40  lb bags of sunflower seed a year.<br/>\nWe also get  a  few Hairy woodpeckers -quite scarce now,  although we did see two pair  lst spring about a mile from our house. they  seem to prefer thicker forest  and quieter, they used to come in all the time We get regular visits from the huge Pileated Woodpeckers  -noisy flocks  of birds at the feeders-especially just before a snow storm seem to bring them and the flickers in to investigate the commotion abut our feeders dont work for them. Occasionally if we get some chunks of fat and Allan is ambitious he will get a ladder and nail chunks of it to a tree agout 12 + feet up  and they will hammer away at that.<br/>\nAgain the girls  take it all for granted having grown up with  it but we  draw attention to them  and they always run and call me if they see the Pileated woodpeckers  come in-they have a huge spruce tree  two  feet  outside their bedroom window and were delighted last year when one would come and  poke around under the bark They are  well aware of the birds;  for all of their seeming indifference; and  point out geese and ducks feeding etc  more than  many of the other kids we have had travel with us.<br/>\nWe feed the ravens on the compost pile-all of the household scraps-we bang the dish a couple of times and hear an answering &quot;Klonk&quot; from nearby. It is neat to notice that if there is a small amount; the two &quot;tree owner&quot; ravens and their last year offspring come in and quietly feed but if on occasion I have cleaned out the frig and there is huge amounts they will call and &quot;invite&quot; some of the others over. Had to quit that the last two summers because of the prevelance of visiting bears but  all is quiet now.<br/>\ngrace-where it is snowing again- and i am reminded to go and get some of the small seed for the juncos  from the feed room. The girls have settled their differences  for  the moment and are playing -quad racing-split screen on the playstation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87024,"nextTopicId":87026}}
