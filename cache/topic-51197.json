If you missed an exam<br/>\nbecause of an unexcused absence (not ill or anything) they could fail you on<br/>\nthat test.  I had a chance to take an extra week at spring break to meet my<br/>\nfather in Germany.  He was travelling for work in the Persian Gulf and had<br/>\nnever been back to Germany since he left at age 13.  None of the teachers<br/>\ngave me any static about it or failed me on any tests . . . except my<br/>\n*German* teacher.  She had never liked my free spirit, and she scheduled an<br/>\nexam that week on purpose, so she could fail me on it . . . sigh.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: college courses RE Pams Daughter","postDate":"1039614820","msgId":51197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4NC4xMzRhNGU3MS4yYjI4OWQ2NEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51362,"prevInTime":51196,"nextInTime":51198,"topicId":51197,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeah.. attendance policies were a very sore spot with me too.
