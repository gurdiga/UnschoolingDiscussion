I&#39;m also in Missouri, nice to see another on here!  <br/>\n My oldest dd is also a fluent reader(middle school level), and she will be 10 in October.  Madison(one with vision trouble), will be a total different type to help learn to read--she&#39;s 6 1/2.  I know that it is VERY frustrating when it comes down to insisting on her doing this or doing that on reading(for the past year).  But if I am really easy going and not caring about it, she is actually wanting to do more.   I have alot to learn I know.  We start homeschooling in a week, I&#39;m going to feel really guilty when I let our oldest do most of the stuff on her own, so that I can focus on Madison and such.   I would be interested to see how unschooling has on record keeping.<br/>\nVanessa<br/>\nOur lil&#39; sweeties:<br/>\n   Victoria Rose, Madison Grace, and<br/>\n              David Kent<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39390,"nextTopicId":39437}}
