When I first got on line, I was a <br/>\nnew mom who, as a former teacher who knew EVERYTHING about kids before <br/>\nbecoming a mom, had very different ideas about life and parenting and <br/>\nkids than I do now.  I was sometimes on the receiving end of some very <br/>\nharsh but valuable words which challenged my thinking and my actions. <br/>\n When I got on line I was going to nurse for one year, but not a day <br/>\nlonger and by god I would not ever nurse a walking talking toddler or, <br/>\noh my the horror, and OLDER child.  Yep, I ended up eating those words, <br/>\nas my oldest nursed until almost six and my five year old, whom I made <br/>\nthe mistake of calling weaned last year at 4 1/2 still a few times a <br/>\nweek asks to nurse.  I would never have had an open mind to even <br/>\nconsider nursing an older child if a few very strong minded and open <br/>\nmouthed women (and a few men) had not opened their mouth and sometimes <br/>\nstrongly helped me to reconsider my ideas and parenting philosophies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTen years ago the idea of unschooling would have been a horrible one for <br/>\nme, near child abuse.  Yes, small children can learn their letters and <br/>\nsuch with a hands on gentle approach, but reading needed a direct <br/>\napproach, math needed to be taught, year by year, with different skills <br/>\nbeing taught, and then retaught, each year.  I did know one family who <br/>\nhomeschooled, a very interesting person who had a large number of kids <br/>\nin Alb. New Mexico, and she was completely blind.  I really don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow she homeschooled, but I know I was impressed with her and probably <br/>\njust assumed that she schooled at home.  Sandra, wonder if this person <br/>\nsounds familiar to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n10 years ago I would have thought that homeschooling was something only <br/>\na very few could do, probably those with a background in education or a <br/>\nmasters degree or better, those with very smart children who have no <br/>\ndifficulties learning--hardly something the average mother or father <br/>\ncould do.  And I certainly could not have thought, ever, that <br/>\nhomeschooling might not take place at odd hours, as it does in our <br/>\nhousehold--9-3:15, that&#39;s when kids learn!  With a planned scheduled <br/>\nlunch and two breaks, morning and afternoon, but the rest of the time <br/>\nshould be at the kitchen table learning with books and curriculum and <br/>\nstuff planned out in advance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure glad Bonnie was on Parent-L and introduced me to another type <br/>\nof learning.  I&#39;m sure glad that Parent-L was around and that I had an <br/>\nopen mind and that instead of getting all defensive I was able to open <br/>\nmy mind and think--hey, there is a different way!  Oh wait, I better say <br/>\nthis or Dar will say it for me, I&#39;m sure--sometimes I did get defensive, <br/>\nsometimes I was called on the carpet, sometimes people were, gasp, rough <br/>\nwith me, a lot straight forward and laying it on the line and <br/>\nchallenging my beliefs and opinions and ideas and make me think again <br/>\nand change those opinions and beliefs and ideas.  All those strong <br/>\nParent-L women, I&#39;m sure they sometimes felt like I would never change <br/>\nmy ways, but I was open minded enough to think about stuff and figure <br/>\nout what was best for my family.  And I have to say that sometimes I <br/>\nlearned the most during threads where I contributed little or nothing <br/>\nbut just listened and thought.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is my hope here.  If there is just one one parent out there who <br/>\nhas been reading this thread and is thinking... then to me it&#39;s worth <br/>\nit.  This isn&#39;t about me, it isn&#39;t about Oom or whatever her name is, to <br/>\nme part of it is the augumentation skills involved in forming coherent <br/>\nthoughts and auguments; and the rest of it is simply an outlet to <br/>\nexpress my belief, but if one person gets something from this, then <br/>\nthat&#39;s even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut I do love a good debate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn, whose 8 year old was watching Peter Pan II yesterday and said, <br/>\nto my amusement, &quot;MOM, that is SO TOTALLY Historically Inaccurate!&quot;  No <br/>\ndoubt, but still, child, it&#39;s a CARTOON!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77545,"nextTopicId":77520}}
