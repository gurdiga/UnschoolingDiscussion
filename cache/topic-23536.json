I never used the word unschooling but he totally got what I was <br/>\ntalking about. Unreal. Had another great conversation about the HSC conference<br/>\nin CA with mymom the other day, again talking about unschooling without<br/>\nusing the word. She totally was into what I was saying. Very cool. You just<br/>\nnever know.

I don&#39;t offer much about the way we don&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; unless pressed.  Usually, I just say we learn from life, and use things all around us, and I don&#39;t buy a certain packaged curriculum.  Call me paranoid, but I just don&#39;t see why it is anybody&#39;s business, unless they are trying to find a better fit for their own family.  I don&#39;t want to volunteer anything that could come back and bite me later.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople might guess....I am always telling other homeschoolers that they should relax a bit and not be so rigid in keeping schedules, and look for opportunities to insert a bit of knowledge.  The best advice I try to give is to really REALLY answer the kids&#39; questions instead of giving them the &quot;not now, dear&quot; line.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, we found some gecko eggs, which the youngest kids wanted to keep and hatch.  They asked me what kind of food they&#39;d need to provide, and decided to go look it up when I said I didn&#39;t know.  First, they had to figure out how to spell the word &quot;gecko&quot;.  It was great.  I did read the paragraph to them, to speed things along a bit, but made them find the article to begin with.<br/>\nLaurie<br/>\nMom to Kelly-17, Kerry-15, Katie-12, Korey-10, and Kacie-8<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Gb5edSH9IMUQftGK5Qjz8L6tHQ3qirCN_jPYqSw3kHU8-Y6AX38vZYSWWD5Jzc20pyIzJ6nKL6iv","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1377","postDate":"998611276","msgId":23543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZjLmYwNDFjZjkuMjhiNmYzNGNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23536,"nextInTopic":23544,"prevInTime":23542,"nextInTime":23544,"topicId":23536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 08/23/2001 10:48:08 PM !!!First Boot!!!, ...

(an over bearing woman, who only sees black<br/>\nand white, I love her and know she means well, but I shake at the thought of<br/>\nher anger).
