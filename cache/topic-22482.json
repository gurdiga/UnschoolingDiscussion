In this case,<br/>\nthe old advertising saying, &quot;location, location, location&quot; makes it &quot;prime.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo, no one except the woman and her children know how many dogs there are.<br/>\nThe papers have reported 27, then 15 and now they are saying they removed<br/>\nFOUR dogs.  Amazing how the number shrinks when they got what they wanted,<br/>\nwhich was the woman out of her home!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stereotyping going on with this thread is really something else.  A<br/>\nchild<br/>\nis informed that his mother has been snatched by the police.  The cops come<br/>\nand want to remove him and his siblings from their home.  He runs back in<br/>\nthe<br/>\nhouse and SUPPOSEDLY says something about guns.  Not one gun has been seen,<br/>\nno shots have been fired.  His mother was worried about loosing her home,<br/>\nwhich indeed happend but that makes her paranoid.  Based on this slim<br/>\ninformation people have LABELED then &quot;not normal,&quot; &quot;paranoid,&quot; and implied<br/>\nthey had survivalist mentality.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese people don&#39;t live the way I live or the way I would want to.  They<br/>\ndon&#39;t live in an area I would want to live in.  They have made choices I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have made.  However, I respect their RIGHT to make their own<br/>\npersonal choices and I&#39;m not going to start throwing out paranoia (all the<br/>\nimplied survivalist boogy man stuff) and judgemental labels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this labeling and judging simply amazes me on an unschooling list!  Of<br/>\nall the people to be doing it, seems that those who are part of a group that<br/>\nhas been given the worst public image in the homeschooling community would<br/>\nbe a little more open to allowing others to make &quot;different&quot; choices and not<br/>\nbe so quick to rush to judgement with little or nothing in the line of facts<br/>\nto base that judgement on!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes I have been biten.  No, I haven&#39;t been chased because I know better<br/>\nthan to run.  As to dogs chasing folks on bicycles, well we know where<br/>\n&quot;those&quot; kinds of dogs live and we&#39;ve cured them with a little amonia and<br/>\nwater in a squirt bottle.  It&#39;s never taken more than two &quot;lessons.&quot;  And if<br/>\nwe are bicycling in an area that we aren&#39;t familiar with, we take along our<br/>\nsquirt bottles.  And, before the question is asked, yes, the kidlets are<br/>\nvery familiar with the concept and able to employee it even under duress.<br/>\nNo. 3 son used his quite successfully when he was under 3 yo.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RValvo7626@...\">RValvo7626@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;     From what I read the person wasn&#39;t ON the &quot;prime&quot; property.

I have been<br/>\n&gt; chased,bit at and hit  by dogs while cycling. It is in no way OK w/ me. It<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; a mazing to me that people do not take responsibility for their dogs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    This is not &quot;normal&quot; to have 20 some dogs that run wild and hunt their<br/>\nown<br/>\n&gt; food. let alone some one was injured by one of them or more (don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; many she encountered).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     I just think it is uncalled for to pick apart the word severe in this<br/>\n&gt; case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Have you ever been bit or even chased by a dog intent on harming you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     NICKI~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22405,"nextTopicId":22507}}
