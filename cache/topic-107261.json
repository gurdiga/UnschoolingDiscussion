That MIGHT have a lot to do with how he turned  out......<br/>\n <br/>\nI know that I made some poor choices with my two oldest daughters (who are  <br/>\non their own now).  I didn&#39;t teach them better about the dangers of getting  <br/>\ntoo deep in debt....I didn&#39;t teach them how to budget better.  I have tried  <br/>\nsince they moved out to talk with them about it, and they are doing better, but  <br/>\nI have one daughter who probably has about 10 credit cards maxed out.  I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t help but think if I had talked more with her about it when they were  <br/>\nyounger, or set a better example (we&#39;ve been up to our eyeballs in bills a few  <br/>\ntimes) they&#39;d have some money in savings, and not having a harder time with  <br/>\nbills.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son (17) just won the county 4H &quot;Hands&quot; award...the award for always  <br/>\npitching in, helping out without being asked, working hard.  He helped  build our <br/>\nhouse (started when he was about 12) side by side with my  husband.  At times, <br/>\nyeah, he HAD to help, but I can&#39;t begin to count the  times I looked outside <br/>\nand they&#39;d be working together laughing about this or  that,...I KNOW that the <br/>\nwork he&#39;s done around here, mostly always with a good  attitude, has formed <br/>\nhim into who he is now.  Just like my daughters do  very well at their jobs and <br/>\ncollege...probably because of not being burnt out in  public school.<br/>\n <br/>\nI know that when I was working full time, trying to school them, stressing  <br/>\nout, life was really hard and I wasn&#39;t a very nice person.  I know those  few <br/>\nyears have probably affected my kids, and I regret being in that  situation.  <br/>\nIt was more than I could handle.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201436708,"authorName":"arcarpenter2003","from":"&quot;arcarpenter2003&quot; &lt;arcarpenter@...&gt;","profile":"arcarpenter2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Re: Leo; was effects of how children are raised","postDate":"1121451312","msgId":107297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRiOHVmZytlcGpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNzU3NzlBQzIyMzc4NS0zNjAtMjA1Q0ZATUJMSy1NMzYuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107296,"nextInTopic":107313,"prevInTime":107296,"nextInTime":107298,"topicId":107261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... == ...

My sister and I have discussed this.   My dad died in the <br/>\nlate 70&#39;s.   He had been way nicer to me than to my sister.   She ended up <br/>\nliving with him after my parents divorced and he had remarried a woman not at ALL <br/>\nlike us, and she was always telling my sister to tie her hair back and dress <br/>\ndifferent, be/walk/eat/sit differently, and my dad backed the &quot;new mom&quot; up.   <br/>\nThen they divorced, so my sister was totally torqued (she was 14/15 at the time <br/>\nof all this) because my dad had been strict with her for nothing, for no one, <br/>\nshe felt.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile my mom had always favored my sister, from the time she was born, it <br/>\nseemed to me.   She took her side over me consistently.   She called me &quot;a <br/>\ndaddy&#39;s girl,&quot; and not in a nice tone of voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we had some discussion here about how very much Marty is like <br/>\nKeith.   &quot;Kirby has always    looked more like you,&quot; Keith&#39;s mom said.    Well, he <br/>\nlooks like Keith too, until Marty shows up and REALLY looks like Keith.   But <br/>\nit&#39;s more than looks, it&#39;s temperament, biological conditions (similar skin, <br/>\nbedwetting later than others which Keith also did, similar aches, both get <br/>\nathlete&#39;s foot and the other kids never have, both introverts, both left <br/>\nhanded...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a non-related friend who&#39;s mostly friends with me, and one day when <br/>\nwe were talking about my kids I told him I couldn&#39;t help but like Marty a lot <br/>\nbecause he was so much like a cute young Keith, and the friend   said he&#39;d <br/>\nalwas liked Kirby because Kirby was so much like me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sort of business probably has an effect even when the parent can&#39;t see <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend whose parents divorced bitterly, and the mom actively hated <br/>\nthe father.   Poor Kid was (as Marty is to Keith) nearly a clone, and as he got <br/>\nolder and his beard came in like his dads and his voice came to sound like <br/>\nhis dad&#39;s, his mom started treating him worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was briefly married into a family with six kids.   I married #2, because <br/>\nthe parents died and his youngest brother and sister were young, 10 and 12 and <br/>\nwere going to be taken away from him because though he had already been their <br/>\ncaretaker for a while, but he was 23 and not married and the judge was going to <br/>\ndeny custody.     The two oldest had been born while the parents were college <br/>\nstudents in Albuquerque in the 50s&#39;.   The second two had been born when the <br/>\nparents were living in Las Vegas and working not-so-great jobs.   The dad was <br/>\nfixing vending machines and pinball machines and the mom was home with the <br/>\nkids.    Then the mom started teaching, the dad went back to school and got an <br/>\nengineering degree, got a good job at Los Alamos National Laboratories, they had <br/>\ntwo more kids, bought a cool old six acre farm with a funky-cool house and <br/>\nstarted living like moneyed liberals (&quot;rich hippies,&quot; basically).   By then the <br/>\ndad was drinking quite a bit.   Too much.   The mom was rarely home, as she <br/>\ntaught at some distance, and the older boys took care of the younger kids, more <br/>\nor less.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the most extreme &quot;the same family&quot; I&#39;ve ever seen.

One is a 47 year old  delinquent, one is a middle <br/>\nmanager making lots of money, and I&#39;m a person who  pays her bills and does <br/>\nkind things for people.  How should my mother feel  about that?  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I don&#39;t know the definitive answer to nature vs. nurture, but I did want to comment about being raised in the same household.  My sister and brother are 13 and 10 years older than I am.  We are VERY different.  We were all raised in the same household, but circumstances changed with each of us, as I think they always do.  My sister and brother were born when my parents were young and didn&#39;t have much money.  My dad was a teacher and my mom worked part time in childcare but mostly stayed at home.  My dad adored my sister, he really put her on a pedestal   He and my brother really clashed.  By the time I came along their marriage was failing and I didn&#39;t really see him much, though we did take trips all around New Mexico that I remember and cherish.  My mom adored all of her kids.  <br/>\nWhen I was young my mom&#39;s views on children had changed lots, she became much more open minded.  She was probably a better mom to me than she was to my brother and sister.  She is MUCH better with my son than she was with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister married young, became an optometrist, and moved far away.  She was distant and selfish.  She never had kids.  She is now divorced, remarried, and is working on reconnecting with her family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother married fairly young too, and stayed in Alamogordo, he is a mechanic.  He has 2 kids, a wife that I love like a sister (and get along with better than my sister), and though I disagree with some of his parenting philosophies, he is probably the best, most moral, most well-meaning, thoughtful man I know.  In many ways I strive to be more like him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was leading a fairly dangerous lifestyle in high school and college, got pregnant at 20, and realized what I was doing.  My son saved my life, really.  I have always been a single parent.  I tend to rebel, to always go against the grain.  I also tend to be overly sensitive (in the feelings get hurt easily sort of way, so is my son).  My son is the most important thing in the world to me, and I often end up pushing friends away because either I would rather be with him, or because I don&#39;t like their influence on him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy long rambling point is that we all grew up in the same household, with the same parents, but were all raised very differently.  And we are all very different people.  Yes genetics had a lot to do with it, but so did our parents.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion is that nature and nurture both play a part, but giving your children a warm, peaceful, loving household goes a long way towards creating warm, peaceful, loving adults.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] effects of how children are raised (was about a b...","postDate":"1121379027","msgId":107273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlLjQ5NDUxOWMzLjMwMDgzY2QzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107272,"nextInTopic":107274,"prevInTime":107272,"nextInTime":107274,"topicId":107261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/14/2005 5:07:55 PM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: So are  we all saying that unschooling just ain t all  that? ~~~ It s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-519701934\">In a message dated 7/14/2005 5:07:55 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nSo are  we all saying that unschooling just ain&#39;t all  that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s all that, but it&#39;s not the only thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] effects of how children are raised (was about a b...","postDate":"1121378944","msgId":107272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyLjU4ZTNlM2VjLjMwMDgzYzgwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107271,"nextInTopic":107273,"prevInTime":107271,"nextInTime":107273,"topicId":107261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/14/2005 4:56:01 PM Central Standard Time, mjcmbrwn@ihug.co.nz writes: One of  my sons said to me once, When you blame yourself for my ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1649443369\">In a message dated 7/14/2005 4:56:01 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjcmbrwn@...\">mjcmbrwn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of  my sons said to me once, &quot;When you blame yourself for my <br/>\nmistakes, I feel  like you are claiming all my good stuff too, and that <br/>\nleaves me feeling  like I&#39;m not a real person&quot; or words to that effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nYES!

There&#39;s not even any reason to  unschool.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAt no point does a parent get the opportunity to  &quot;recognize&quot; that nothing <br/>\nthey did while their children were growing up  affected what they did as <br/>\nadults or <br/>\nhow they did it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would one  even want that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is the deal.  It&#39;s an issue that confuses me. I don&#39;t really  think that <br/>\nparenting is not a factor at all.  It&#39;s just one of many.<br/>\n <br/>\nJohn Hinkley&#39;s mother can&#39;t take any responsiblity for what her crazy son  <br/>\ndid.  There may have been things she could have done to mitigate his  craziness. <br/>\n But she can&#39;t predict the future.  Who can?  What  good does it do for her <br/>\nto sit around and say, &quot;If only I&#39;d done x...&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I hear about my son saving the life of a man whose horse and  carriage <br/>\nran under the path of a streetcar in Memphis a few weeks ago, do I get  to pat <br/>\nmyself on the back because I raised him well?  No.  I didn&#39;t do  anything to <br/>\nmake him like that or that would predict that he would be able to  act swiftly <br/>\nand surely in an emergency situation.  It&#39;s all on him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to take credit for the way my children turned out.   Although I <br/>\nwould feel guilty if my son did something like John Hinkley, I can&#39;t  be <br/>\nblamed.  It&#39;s a dichotomy that I can&#39;t reconcile in my mind.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI give my kids a happy and peaceful home.  I can&#39;t predict the  outcome.  So, <br/>\nthe day to day, the now, is what matters.  Unschooling  doesn&#39;t guarantee any <br/>\nsort of result, except peace and happiness today.   Unschooling did not mold <br/>\nmy son into a lifesaver.  Not unschooling did not  mold John Hinkley into a <br/>\ncrazy person.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo what does?  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107283,"nextTopicId":107310}}
