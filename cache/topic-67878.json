My sister in law is a special education<br/>\nteacher and very into her career!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cousin is a special ed teacher.  Fifteen years ago, when I was<br/>\nhomeschooling my older son, she was very much against it.  Now, she says she<br/>\nwishes she had homeschooled her kids.  In fact she was the one that more or<br/>\nless convinced my son not to try school a couple of years ago.  We were<br/>\nhaving dinner with her, and she kept going on and on about this kid or that<br/>\nkid she wanted to help but couldn&#39;t because of bureaucracy or power-tripping<br/>\nteachers or principals.  At the end of the meal, she said to Lars, &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember what your mother told me.  Are you going to school this year?&quot;  He<br/>\nhesitated for only a second and then said no.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67788,"nextTopicId":67874}}
