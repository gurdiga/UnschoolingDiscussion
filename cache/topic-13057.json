She is really great with them and they all play together wonderfully.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout two weeks ago a couple of girls who were visiting their grandfather across the street and were a bit older than our neighbor, came over to our driveway while the three kids were playing.  I don&#39;t think that they even knew our neighbor.  They did not see hubby and I sitting on the porch watching the kids.  They asked her &quot;Are you playing with THEM?!&quot;  as though it was something they could hardly believe.  Then they proceeded to ask my boys (shouting into their faces, as though they were hearing impaired, of just stupid) &quot;HOW OLD ARE YOU?  ARE YOU FIVE?

The visitors looked surprised and embarrassed, muttered some comment to our neighbor and went back across the street.  She was apparently embarrassed by what they said, as she took off and rode her bike around for a few minutes.  But she eventually came back and resumed her games with my boys.  I know that those two brats from across the street were PS kids, because they come over to their grnadfather&#39;s house after school.

Those who seem to be more socially capable and healthy are the ones with just a few good friends and plenty of time to spend with themselves.  Look at the lives in ages past of children who went on to become great leaders, heros and inventors in our own country (for the Americans here, I mean) and compare the amount of social interaction they got to what kids get today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids today are overloaded, overworked, overburdened, undertrusted, and irresponsible.  They are buried under mountains of schoolwork and given very little real work and roles in the family to fulfill.  They are treated as sub-human and not trusted to be intelligent, thinking and feeling beings.

We also live<br/>\nin a neighborhood filled with psed kids, and I, too, am amazed at the lack<br/>\nof real life social skills the average school child appears to have.  Here&#39;s<br/>\nan example from just last week-my son and the next door neighbor are pretty<br/>\ngood friends, except for when other public school kids come to play.  This<br/>\nfriend is 2 years older than my ds.  In public school it&#39;s pretty<br/>\nunacceptable for a 9 year old to play with a 7 year old, so when other psed<br/>\nkids come around, as happened the other day, suddenly my son is a &quot;baby&quot; and<br/>\nonly wants to play &quot;stupid girly baby games&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, last week ds and his friend are playing together and having lots of fun.<br/>\nI looked out the window and noticed a couple kids had joined them-they<br/>\nlooked okay so I went on with my work.  A few minutes later ds comes into<br/>\nthe house visibly upset.  He said to me &quot;Mom, the new kid said he hated me!&quot;<br/>\nWe talked about that for a minute (me: well who is that kid? ds: I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow him.  me: then he doesn&#39;t know you either, right? ds: no. me: so how<br/>\ncan he hate you? he doesn&#39;t even know you. he&#39;s just being a silly kid.)<br/>\nthen I thought to ask-well did your friend stick up for you?  Ds said no.<br/>\nWell that didn&#39;t surprize me, but I also asked ds-Did your friend say<br/>\n*anything*? Ds answered-I asked him if he hated me, too, and he said<br/>\n&#39;maybe&#39;.  Ugh!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell-then we ended up talking about peer pressure (again).  Later that day<br/>\nthe neighbor psed boys wanted to play bike tag and ds didn&#39;t want to.  He<br/>\ncame home upset again and said they called him a baby.  I asked why.  He<br/>\nsaid it was because he didn&#39;t want to play bike tag.  Weeeelll! I was proud<br/>\nof him and told him so.  Dh was right there, and he expressed how glad he<br/>\nwas that ds did what he wanted to do no matter what the other kids said.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeer pressure is insidious-it can involve itself in nearly every interaction<br/>\nbetween psed children.  What&#39;s so great about being a homeschooling family<br/>\nis that the triumphs and losses of my children&#39;s socialization experiences<br/>\nare witnessed by me and dh.  We were there for him when he needed us to<br/>\nconfirm his decisions, to support him when he was feeling unhappy.  I feel<br/>\nsorry for the psed kids who have to face learning socialization at school on<br/>\ntheir own with no loving adult or family member to support and confirm them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you stop to consider the type of socialization the institutional school<br/>\nsetting provides, it&#39;s really no wonder things like cliques and &quot;trenchcoat<br/>\nmafia&quot; kids exist.  They feel the need to protect themselves somehow-so they<br/>\ntry to mimic the institution of the family outside of the home. Without the<br/>\nwisdom of adult guidance and family tradition, their groups end up<br/>\nresembling gangs (groups assembling based on fear) rather than clubs<br/>\n(friends gathering based on mutual affection and interests).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo its good to know I&#39;m not alone-that there are other hs families who have<br/>\nto deal with psed kids and the institutionalized discrimination they learn<br/>\nat school.  What&#39;s so funny about all this (not ha ha, but funny ironic) is<br/>\nthat those who think homeschooling is wrong often state that children who<br/>\nare homeschooled learn to discriminate because they are not exposed to<br/>\npeople of differing backgrounds.  What a bunch of hooey.  If they would just<br/>\ntake one minute to really examine the ps system, and reflect on their own<br/>\ninstitutional school experience, then maybe they&#39;d realise there&#39;s *more*<br/>\ndiscrimination and bigotry inherent in the institutional schooling<br/>\nexperience than in nearly any private family tradition or practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nLee</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Sj4UW1rMmgPwIAojQHl5rAKh0SaPuYe70aY0HbIfCUDOobdPFlB9IStuDNASlj7ohOFXaib-DeVzbMQ9xOpM_5k9","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Friends in the neighborhood","postDate":"968664829","msgId":13070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5QkNBNkZELjRCQUUzM0MxQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDc3Ljk1YWMxMmQuMjZlYzU1MThAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13060,"nextInTopic":13072,"prevInTime":13069,"nextInTime":13071,"topicId":13057,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am forever disgusted with the lack of socialization and certainly social graces of public-schooled children.

No<br/>\nwonder so many individuals have social interaction challenges on the job<br/>\ntoo!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me spew...<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"dawn","from":"dawn &lt;dawn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YDbI6cgoCZmXCoYjcN4DCd2-DGzkz7VwU6pzl_bNyDmsa89D3eLKNQPkTDB5wGnjEMR8GJ9wLA3cAkg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Friends in the neighborhood","postDate":"968594881","msgId":13060,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBpbmUuQlNGLjQuMDUuMTAwMDkxMDA3MDEwNjAuMjAyMjktMTAwMDAwQG1hdGUua2pzbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM0LjhmNGU3ODguMjZlYzU4YWFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":13057,"nextInTopic":13070,"prevInTime":13059,"nextInTime":13061,"topicId":13057,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"we live in an apartment complex and have way more yard space than most people in houses (although absolutely NO privacy).

We just got back from <br/>\nvisiting with my SIL and her family because they just bought a new house.  <br/>\nThe house of course is beautiful, but when we went outside I just got the <br/>\nmost strange feeling.  Either way I looked up or down the street, it seemed <br/>\nendless.  Endless rows of cookie cutter houses and I could just imagine <br/>\nMonday morning when all the cars pull out of the driveways and then the buses <br/>\ncome to pick up all the kids and no one will be home until 7 or so that night <br/>\nbecause of after care or after school activities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I went to ps the neighborhood I grew up in seems so different <br/>\nfrom what I see today.  All the neighborhood kids (and there were a lot) were <br/>\nout and about after school and we played (kids of all ages) until dark.  We <br/>\nlive in an older neighborhood and the only kids my kids ages are in day care <br/>\nand school.  But our neighbor is a grandma and she is very active in her <br/>\ngarden so we hang out with her and the kids love getting fresh stuff from her <br/>\ngarden.  SHe also has grandkids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that once I start getting active with the h/s group in my area my <br/>\nkids will find playmates among those kids.  From their newsletter the group <br/>\nseems very active with lots planned.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13107,"nextTopicId":13109}}
