Deaf/Blind do communicate and do receive input. In fact<br/>\none of the noisiest places I have ever been was a deaf blind<br/>\nparty.<br/>\n<br/>\nCP can restrict vocalization - but in and of itself in no way<br/>\nrestricts the ability to receive input.  A good chunk of<br/>\nassistive technology will solve the vocalization problem.  I have<br/>\na friend who unschooled her daughter with spastic quadriplegia CP<br/>\nto age 16 - at that point the child was ready for college - but<br/>\ndecided instead to attend ps for 2 years to try out some<br/>\ntransition plan services.  Nothing the school had to offer in<br/>\nthat area was as good as what she had learned, which further<br/>\nbuilt her confidence.  Even when talking about profound MR, there<br/>\nis no reason to think that the parent cannot if so inclined<br/>\nprovide what the child needs - perhaps buying some services.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO (LOL) a child with significant disabilities has all the more<br/>\nreason to be kept away from the self-esteem destructive world of<br/>\ngovernment schools.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38016,"nextTopicId":38017}}
