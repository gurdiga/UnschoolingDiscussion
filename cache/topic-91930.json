I am very uncomfortable both with<br/>\nthe idea of limiting food (why should Jayn have to be limited for Renee�s<br/>\nsake) and yet I can hardly go against something the mother has specifically<br/>\ndemanded. Renee is overweight and I guess they are trying limiting to deal<br/>\nwith it. Her mother always asks if she has �behaved�. Of course she has.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

There had been two Christian","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1342389607\">This is long...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I began homeschooling in 1990 the VA county we lived in had an active<br/>\nsupport group of about 10 families.  There had been two Christian families<br/>\nand one had moved, leaving one in the group.  That had never been a problem.<br/>\nWhen I and another lady (both Christians) met the Christian hs-ing mom, she<br/>\ninvited us to the group&#39;s meeting.  The first time I went my chldren and I<br/>\nenjoyed meeting other homeschoolers (at one of their homes).  The children<br/>\nplayed and I talked with some of the moms.  At noon those who had been in<br/>\nthe group got out their lunches (we didn&#39;t know to bring anything) and began<br/>\neating.  One lady asked me &quot;Are you a vegeterian?&quot;  When I said no, she<br/>\nimmediately turned away and didn&#39;t speak again.  The next week we went on a<br/>\nhike with the group.  Again, my children and I had a wonderful time and were<br/>\nenjoying meeting experienced homeschoolers.  It was a different group of<br/>\npeople than any we had known before, both because of the hs-ing and because<br/>\nof different practices.  On the hike several talked of homeopathy (which I&#39;d<br/>\nnever heard of), and when we rested two women began breastfeeding (which I&#39;d<br/>\ndone with all three kids for about a year), but they had children about 3 or<br/>\n4.  I wasn&#39;t too surprised as I&#39;d heard of long-term breastfeeding, just<br/>\nnever seen it.  When I went to the parking lot to get our lunch (I knew to<br/>\nbring it this time!), I saw the leader of the group, the Christian &quot;old&quot;<br/>\nmember, and the other &quot;new&quot; member talking.  The leader was saying that<br/>\nthere were several people in the group that didn&#39;t want &quot;so many different&quot;<br/>\npeople coming in because they might change things.  One of the others asked<br/>\nif it was because they were Christians and the leader said (rough quote),<br/>\n&quot;Well, no one really wants to put it that way.  It&#39;s just that people have<br/>\ndifferent beliefs...&quot;  The old member said, well, maybe she could drop out<br/>\nand help start a new group with the Christians.  So that&#39;s what we did.<br/>\nAfter that experience, we made sure not to make it an exclusive group.  It<br/>\nwas interesting because as the years passed some of the other group&#39;s<br/>\nmembers would come to our activities, especially field trips or play days.<br/>\n    I have never been in a group that made members agree to a statement of<br/>\nfaith.  One group I was in started requiring that of leaders and I quit the<br/>\ngroup.   I agree with whoever (Sandra ?) said that if a group says right up<br/>\nfront who&#39;s welcome that&#39;s fine (such as a Catholic homeschoolers group,<br/>\netc.).  But I think it would be nice if more people got along with others<br/>\nand enjoyed the diversity that is homeschooling/unschooling rather than just<br/>\nbeing with likeminded ones.   I have always wanted to meet people who have<br/>\ndifferent beliefs, customs, and viewpoints, but I know that makes a lot of<br/>\npeople uncomfortable.<br/>\n    Sometimes it&#39;s hard being a Christian (who started out pretty<br/>\nconservative but isn&#39;t so much any more) and a homeschooler (who started out<br/>\nwith curriculum, then got rid of the books and let the kids learn while<br/>\nenjoying life).<br/>\nMany area homeschoolers shun me as too liberal and not doing as a Christian<br/>\nhomeschooler should.  I don&#39;t know any local unschoolers.  Now my ds13 is<br/>\nwanting to go to school next year.  We went yesterday to the high school and<br/>\ntalked with a counselor.  My dh says it&#39;s okay with him, but I think that&#39;s<br/>\njust because he doesn&#39;t think that unschooling is good, so he&#39;d rather have<br/>\nds go to school.  I want ds to go if that&#39;s what he wants, because he wants<br/>\nto see what it&#39;s like.  He has plenty of friends (all schooled) and is<br/>\nactive in theater.  He has also taught himself enough computer &quot;stuff&quot; (two<br/>\nlanguages, sets up websites and creates games), so that a friend who teaches<br/>\nCIS classes at a university has invited him to sit in on some jr and sr<br/>\nlevel classes, because that&#39;s what ds is working on.  So he&#39;s learning here<br/>\nat home but he wants the experience of going to school.   If that&#39;s what he<br/>\nstill wants in August, then I guess that&#39;s what he&#39;ll do.  His two younger<br/>\nbrothers are still home.  This probably knocks out a trip to the conference<br/>\nin MA.  I was hoping I might be able to go.<br/>\n    On top of all of this, I&#39;m in my last semester of classes working on a<br/>\nPhD in social foundations of ed.  Why?  I&#39;m not really sure.  What do I want<br/>\nto do?  Don&#39;t know yet.  Helping people homeschool/unschool would be good,<br/>\nbut the more I learn (at school and on this list and other places) the more<br/>\nI know I don&#39;t know.  An early goal was to help bring unity to the hs<br/>\nmovement, but after reading various articles I don&#39;t know if that can<br/>\nhappen.  And I do blame the &quot;Christian hs movement&quot; for that state of<br/>\naffairs, although, to come full circle, some exclusiveness has been shown by<br/>\ndifferent groups at dif. times in dif. places.  I hope that lessens as time<br/>\npasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91859,"nextTopicId":91937}}
