Absences resulting from disciplinary actions or short term suspensions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here&#39;s what I find ridiculous....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bit about transportation being canceled.  Here it&#39;s so wet that when we <br/>\nhave a winter freeze and it thaws, the put all these weight restrictions on <br/>\nthe roads.  Which effectively shuts done the school buses running on the <br/>\nsmaller back roads.  Because it&#39;s so wet, the roads will literally collapse <br/>\nwith the thaw and under the roads turns to mush.   They can run on the main <br/>\nroads...  But, if you&#39;re in the boonies, you&#39;re screwed because <br/>\ntransportation wasn&#39;t cancelled, you just don&#39;t get the bus.... It&#39;s a huge <br/>\ndeal here when it happens because 90% of the parents have to take their <br/>\nchildren to school and the line pulling up to any school is like a 30 minutes <br/>\nto the front door.  Everyone is an hour late for work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, they are dead serious about this attendance policy here.  I have <br/>\nfriends that pulled their kids out because of it.  In one instance they <br/>\nnailed one friend on the $25 a day fine thing for 7 days (she made less than <br/>\n$600 a month) and she couldn&#39;t afford to send the kid to school anymore...  <br/>\nThe kid would hide out in the barn till her mom left and then miss the bus <br/>\nand go back home.  They were drawing up the papers to have her do community <br/>\nservice (the parent, not the kid) at the school for 3 days a week for four <br/>\nmonths, as if she didn&#39;t have to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"B & T Simpson","from":"&quot;B & T Simpson&quot; &lt;michigan@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"p9tmP0d_DItyn8zeT9SJdTlR9Fehf1vjxGhOzHEVeG9Na5qx-A0_K3Yh5b_iN2ua2LiOTiPtjTbk4Ec_5qrSQc7iYeeyzGqfmYyaSQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [OHS] American Power Plant Open House-TODAY!","postDate":"937152357","msgId":2912,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMDQuMjkxMi45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2914,"prevInTime":2911,"nextInTime":2913,"topicId":2912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok I have a major question for all of you that know the laws  just a thought,  how in this country are millions of kids dropping out of school? are their","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1481045373\">Ok I have a major question for all of you that know the laws  just a<br/>\nthought,  how in this country are millions of kids dropping out of school?<br/>\nare their parents taken to court?<br/>\nwhat about all of the pregnant girls that choose to drop out and care for<br/>\ntheir children?<br/>\nwhat do they go thru in order to drop out?  do their parents have to send in<br/>\npapers saying they are been homeschooled? do they have to be tested each<br/>\nyear and report to the state until they are 18?<br/>\nnow consider this, if the answer is no they do not, they just drop out no<br/>\nquestions asked (they are just a bad seed )  couldn&#39;t we then send our high<br/>\nschoolers to school for a month or so and have them drop out and be free<br/>\nfrom the entire system? and have them still homeschool and continue on the<br/>\nway we homeschool without the hassle of sending in papers?  now I know you<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have them drop out of homeschool, that would be to obvious, but<br/>\nwhat about dropping out of public school?<br/>\ndoes anyone know the answers to these questions?<br/>\ndoes anyone know the how old you have to be to get your ged?<br/>\ndoes anyone know how these kids just drop out?<br/>\nhow does one graduate early from homeschool?<br/>\nwhy are homeschoolers required to report to the state  until the child is 18<br/>\nand ps kids can graduate when they are 17? what about my child who started k<br/>\nwhen she just turned 5 the day school started and will be  17 when her class<br/>\ngraduates from highschool?  what if my child was held back in ps  for a<br/>\nyear, do I consider her in that lower grade  or the grade of the children of<br/>\nher own age?  and how does that work out?<br/>\njust some thoughts to ponder for the day!!<br/>\nfrom Tanya and Mary Ellen who think that if the state is willing to just let<br/>\nkids drop out and claim they are just bad then why would they care that they<br/>\nare at home learning????<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Tanya M Simpson<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Be sure to check out my online mall at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blmall.com\">http://www.blmall.com</a><br/>\n please enter d81371220 in the space<br/>\nprovided for code number<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;============================<br/>\n&gt;List information, including commands to subcribe and unsubscribe, for OHS<br/>\n </span></blockquote>can<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;be found at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/ChrisOCo/ohs.html\">http://members.aol.com/ChrisOCo/ohs.html</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2924,"nextTopicId":2927}}
