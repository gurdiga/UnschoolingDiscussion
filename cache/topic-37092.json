TV teaches children to think in &quot;flickers&quot;, as one<br/>\nsociologist puts it.  He refers to the de facto maximum time a particular<br/>\n&quot;scene&quot; lasts before a new view is brought up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son is now 9 months old, and he has yet to see a TV screen &quot;on&quot;, except<br/>\nfor one time when we did an experiment.  We turned the TV on ONCE when he<br/>\nwas about 7 months, and even though both of us were in the room and there<br/>\nwere plenty of other things to do and look at -- which he was always<br/>\notherwise perfectly happy with -- once he spotted that TV picture, it was<br/>\nlike there was nothing else in the room.  No matter what else happened for<br/>\nthe next five minutes, he would not take his eyes off that screen.<br/>\nNeedless to say, that was all we needed to know; it was enough for us.  The<br/>\nTV has stayed OFF ever since.  Shortly, I am building a wall-mount cabinet<br/>\nthat will cover the TV with locked doors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have since noticed this in other children when at friends&#39; houses -- the<br/>\nkids barely even acknowledge that you&#39;re there, they can&#39;t take their eyes<br/>\noff the screen, and basically seem hypnotized.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a>&gt; said:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;When I was in school, I was the kid that got picked on all <br/>\n&gt;the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There seems to be a trend on this list.  That describes my experience as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Funny thing is I loved school, I just couldn&#39;t stand most <br/>\n&gt;of the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Socialization aside - -  from a learning standpoint unschooling has <br/>\n&gt;worked for us.  My girls know lots of stuff abouthistory and science <br/>\n&gt;that I learned sometime in school but forgot right after the test.  <br/>\n&gt;They won&#39;t forget because they learned by seeing it in context or <br/>\n&gt;because they wanted to or because it was in something else they were <br/>\n&gt;working on and it related.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ultimately, that&#39;s how we ALL learn.  Schools have forgotten this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think that our schools are so set on <br/>\n&gt;everyone learning a set core of stuff that they have forgotten that <br/>\n&gt;once we reach adulthood, we each need different things.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Now this brings up a question.  I know in many states that homeschoolers<br/>\nare required to adminster state-mandated tests tot heir own children.  How<br/>\ndo Unschoolers handle these requirements?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Unschooling allows the mechanics among us to focus on cars <br/>\n&gt;and the astronomers to focus on the stars.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Neat rhyme, that even hit home.  I&#39;m a car nut, and have been since 10th<br/>\ngrade -- and became an astronomy buff at the same age.  Over twenty years<br/>\nlater, I have a couple of telescopes (just getting into digital<br/>\nastrophotography) and a small fleet of cars (six of them) that I mess with<br/>\nin the garage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other question relates to whether there are any Unschoolers in Virginia<br/>\non this list?  We live in Shenandoah County, Virginia.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Marc</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37090,"nextTopicId":37042}}
