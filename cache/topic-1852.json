Betsy has them in her underwear instead.  I have treated her<br/>\n&gt;with respect, talked and talked about it, kept it simple, ie &quot;I know you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;poop on the potty when you are ready&quot; and &quot;everybody poops on the potty&quot;<br/>\n&gt;etc.  All I could get out of her was that she was afraid to go on the potty<br/>\n&gt;because it would hurt.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have had her to the doctors for a check-up over this, and she has never<br/>\n&gt;exhibited signs of constipation.  The biggest problem we&#39;ve had with it is<br/>\n&gt;that she &quot;forgets&quot; to tell me about it, so the bm&#39;s get all over her bottom<br/>\n&gt;and causes yeast infections.  (no fun)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last night when we were getting ready for bed and putting away laundry she<br/>\n&gt;walked around the house for half an hour, crying and squeeling *loudly*<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;her butt hurt.

My oldest almost road her bike out in front of a car<br/>\n&gt;when she was five and her scared her so much that she refused to cross<br/>\n&gt;streets for several months.  I remember a similar experience of having to<br/>\n&gt;hold her in the van while she screamed about refusing to cross the parking<br/>\n&gt;lot from the car to the grocery store.  It took about forty-five minutes<br/>\n&gt;before she would allow me to carry her in to the store (and come to think<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;it, she was a few weeks before the age of five at the time, too.

She started<br/>\ngoing to the potty when she was 2.5 exactly and was doing great until march<br/>\nwhen we started making her (worst think we have done so far this year) go to<br/>\nnursery at church. We only made her go for a month before we realized that<br/>\nit was the wrong decision but the damage was done. She took control of the<br/>\none thing she could, her potty habits. She started not only going in her<br/>\npants but going where ever she felt  like. It is a long uphill battle trying<br/>\nto regain her trust and encourage her to use the potty every time. She<br/>\nalways does bm in the toilet but she will still pee where she wants to<br/>\nsometimes. It is very frustrating but what I find works best with her is<br/>\njust treating her with respect and encouraging her but not over praising (it<br/>\njust makes her more self conscious). My point, about the special undies, is<br/>\nthat she can wear her special pooh undies but if she soils them she will<br/>\nquickly run out of them. Some days it works and some days it doesn&#39;t. By the<br/>\nway, she is our most spirited child, our brightest and our most daring (has<br/>\nbeen climbing high and jumping from high places for quite a while).

Tried pull-ups, but she treats<br/>\nthem as a diaper.  Any support or ideas would be helpful&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Mary Ellen,<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat a coincidince, but this is something I am working on as well.  I have<br/>\ndone potty learning by allowing my children in to watch, and respecting<br/>\ntheir own timetables.  All three of my girls learned to use the potty<br/>\nbetween 2 1/2 and 3 years old without accidents.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my twins, who is almost five, has refused to have bowel movements on<br/>\nthe potty.  Betsy has them in her underwear instead.  I have treated her<br/>\nwith respect, talked and talked about it, kept it simple, ie &quot;I know you&#39;ll<br/>\npoop on the potty when you are ready&quot; and &quot;everybody poops on the potty&quot;<br/>\netc.  All I could get out of her was that she was afraid to go on the potty<br/>\nbecause it would hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had her to the doctors for a check-up over this, and she has never<br/>\nexhibited signs of constipation.  The biggest problem we&#39;ve had with it is<br/>\nthat she &quot;forgets&quot; to tell me about it, so the bm&#39;s get all over her bottom<br/>\nand causes yeast infections.  (no fun)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night when we were getting ready for bed and putting away laundry she<br/>\nwalked around the house for half an hour, crying and squeeling *loudly* that<br/>\nher butt hurt.  I decided that it was time to take action, and took her to<br/>\nthe bathroom.  I explained calmly that we wouldn&#39;t leave until she pooped.<br/>\nShe cried and cried, and even tried to bite me.  The other kids were really<br/>\nsupportive, and my oldest drew a picture of Betsy pooping that we hung up on<br/>\nthe wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy screamed and begged to go to bed, but I held my ground and started<br/>\nrubbing her tummy in the &quot;I-love-you&quot; massage (I think it&#39;s in the Sear&#39;s<br/>\nBABY BOOK for colic).  She screamed at me that she was going to DIE if she<br/>\npooped (?!?!) but I kept repeating that I knew she could do it, and whenever<br/>\nI offered to leave she asked me to stay.  After over ninety minutes of<br/>\ncrying, she had the bigest bm I&#39;ve ever seen out of such a small child,<br/>\nstopped crying immediately, and was extremely proud.  She hugged me and said<br/>\nshe needed to go tell her sisters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think her problem stems from one occasion when it did hurt to go, and she<br/>\njust held on to that.  My oldest almost road her bike out in front of a car<br/>\nwhen she was five and her scared her so much that she refused to cross<br/>\nstreets for several months.  I remember a similar experience of having to<br/>\nhold her in the van while she screamed about refusing to cross the parking<br/>\nlot from the car to the grocery store.  It took about forty-five minutes<br/>\nbefore she would allow me to carry her in to the store (and come to think of<br/>\nit, she was a few weeks before the age of five at the time, too.  Hmmmm.<br/>\nCoincidince?) and after that catharsis she got over her fear of crossing the<br/>\nstreet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if this story is really long, and I have no idea where our potty<br/>\nlearning saga will go now.  But Betsy will be five in a few days, so I hope<br/>\nyou don&#39;t feel so alone!  I know of a woman near Pontiac, MI who is<br/>\ngathering information to write a book about late trainers, her twin boys<br/>\nwere still in diapers at the age of five last summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nSandra Brown<br/>\nAnn Arbor, MI<br/>\nMom to Emily 7, Molly and Betsy 4, and Garrison 20 months; all very spirited<br/>\nnonconforming children</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Karen & David Hoogland","from":"&quot;Karen & David Hoogland&quot; &lt;kdhoogland@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5lhVkGPhjCQl0AFwIPh1TL3BZKtJw7Jnxjpo3h0iGXWXupv5F0XnihoZhL5yajJ-ovrBlVGyKYnli8gqDhBFaNp9KrfEoeOrJ3E5RnXhqtLi-SDYP8QG1Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: potty training","postDate":"934374947","msgId":1871,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNDYuMTg3MS45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1870,"nextInTopic":1876,"prevInTime":1870,"nextInTime":1872,"topicId":1852,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Your daughter sounds like my oldest son (he didnt potty train till he was 4).

Her bowels,  however,  have been a completely<br/>\ndifferent story!!  She has had constipation issues from birth.  Our doctor<br/>\nsent us to a specialist when she turned 4.  We agonized with this &#39;bowel<br/>\nprogram&#39;  for 2 1/2 months.  (She was taking 5 TBPS of medicine daily!! And<br/>\nwe struggled to get it in her.)  We finally, &#39;gave it up&#39; and let it go.  I<br/>\ndecided to just let her be for a few months ... maybe she&#39;s just on the far<br/>\nend of that spectrum.<br/>\nWe did not allow her to wear pull-ups during the day.  And she was somewhat<br/>\nlimited with activities if she had accidents (e.g.,  she was not allowed to<br/>\ngo on certain outings or to friends homes if she had had an accident the day<br/>\nbefore.)   THIS WAS NEVER A PUNISHMENT!!  We did offer &#39;incentives&#39;  like<br/>\nspecial outings when she did well.<br/>\nT.Berry Brazelton holds the opinion that some children are afraid to let<br/>\ntheir bowel movements be flushed because they see it as part of<br/>\nthemselves.....I can&#39;t say what goes through the mind of a four year old!!<br/>\nHopefully,  you can hang on to your own comment:  Life&#39;s too<br/>\nmysterious...don&#39;t take it serious.<br/>\nMy only other words of wisdom:  This too shall pass.<br/>\nBlessings,   Susan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Mary E Gates &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m new here and writing from Eastern Washington State.
