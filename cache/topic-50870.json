Sometimes I <br/>\n&gt; wonder how some of you manage to be on the computer so much when <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re being completely child-led.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When mine were little I didn&#39;t read books on my own for a long <br/>\ntime.  <br/>\n&gt; Magazines, during meals, maybe.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When they were little I&#39;d have the baby in a backpack as much as <br/>\npossible, or <br/>\n&gt; playing near me on the floor.  We left the house almost daily, at <br/>\nleast to go <br/>\n&gt; to a park, or a leisurely shopping trip (going up and down all the <br/>\naisles, <br/>\n&gt; kids riding in carts who wanted to, or walking if they wanted, and <br/>\nme forcing <br/>\n&gt; myself not to rush).  We had music on for singing at least once a <br/>\nday.  It <br/>\n&gt; added a layer of doing more than one thing at once, and sometimes <br/>\nit was <br/>\n&gt; ignored and sometimes there was singing.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saturday the other day we had Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor <br/>\nDreamcoat <br/>\n&gt; playing on the Mac (the CD, music only) while Holly was in here <br/>\nplaying a <br/>\n&gt; solitaire game with me.  We sang sometimes, talked about the game <br/>\nsometimes, <br/>\n&gt; talked about other things sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids were up until midnight, 1:00 and I don&#39;t-know-when last <br/>\nnight, so I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; up at 6:30 and they won&#39;t be up for at least four or five hours.  <br/>\nFor a while <br/>\n&gt; yesterday I was the only one home (Keith/dh was home, but way in <br/>\nthe back, <br/>\n&gt; watching football and trying to doze off a coming head-cold; he&#39;s <br/>\nbetter now).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The days come when the kids don&#39;t need to sit in your lap and have <br/>\nyou read <br/>\n&gt; to them.  Holly&#39;s the last one here who needs that.  But while that <br/>\ntime is <br/>\n&gt; there, you just have to ride it through.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wish I hadn&#39;t told Kirby no the times I did.  As the oldest of <br/>\nthree, he <br/>\n&gt; got &quot;no&quot; more than others, once he wasn&#39;t an only, and I know from <br/>\nclear <br/>\n&gt; experience how hard it is to lose the &quot;only&quot; position to another <br/>\nperson.  If <br/>\n&gt; I could do it again I would have made SURE to say yes to Kirby <br/>\nmore.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I also remember being &quot;touched out&quot; when I had infants and <br/>\ntoddlers and <br/>\n&gt; feeling like the next time human skin touched mine I would have to <br/>\nburst into <br/>\n&gt; tears.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Still, I don&#39;t think we can see parenting or unschooling as <br/>\nsomething we can <br/>\n&gt; schedule around our own leisurely lives.  Maybe a time or two a <br/>\nweek I would <br/>\n&gt; go to a movie or help some other adult friend with a project for a <br/>\nbit, while <br/>\n&gt; yet another adult or teen hung out with my kids, or while they were <br/>\nout with <br/>\n&gt; another family or my husband was home with them.  But not every <br/>\nday, by any <br/>\n&gt; means.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s hard but it has to be done.  Kids who are home instead of in <br/>\ndaycare or <br/>\n&gt; school need some direct and concentrated attention.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\ntake less <br/>\n&gt; time and energy to have them home than to dress them up and get <br/>\nthem to <br/>\n&gt; school and back, and all the accompanying other prep and support of <br/>\n&gt; school-going children.    It&#39;s different kinds of time and energy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-My frustration is compounded by the fact that my 3 year old is <br/>\n&gt; sleeping with us and tonight he just isn&#39;t leaving me any room in <br/>\nmy <br/>\n&gt; bed, and I can&#39;t get to sleep anywhere else...  -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you put a twin bed next to yours for a while?

When they were all little, it used to be time to do an aerobics tape when the  kids were watching children&#39;s TV and the baby was asleep or in a nearby bouncer. I also keep books handy for reading in snatches - reading to the kids ( me and them time), reading 5 mins of something  myself,  something I want to read, if everyone else is occupied for 5 mins...A 5 mins me time, rejuventation time..<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, writing down my kids&#39; wants/needs  helps in our house.

We left the house almost daily, at least to go <br/>\nto a park, or a leisurely shopping trip (going up and down all the aisles, <br/>\nkids riding in carts who wanted to, or walking if they wanted, and me forcing <br/>\nmyself not to rush).  We had music on for singing at least once a day.  It <br/>\nadded a layer of doing more than one thing at once, and sometimes it was <br/>\nignored and sometimes there was singing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday the other day we had Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat <br/>\nplaying on the Mac (the CD, music only) while Holly was in here playing a <br/>\nsolitaire game with me.  We sang sometimes, talked about the game sometimes, <br/>\ntalked about other things sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were up until midnight, 1:00 and I don&#39;t-know-when last night, so I&#39;m <br/>\nup at 6:30 and they won&#39;t be up for at least four or five hours.  For a while <br/>\nyesterday I was the only one home (Keith/dh was home, but way in the back, <br/>\nwatching football and trying to doze off a coming head-cold; he&#39;s better now).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe days come when the kids don&#39;t need to sit in your lap and have you read <br/>\nto them.  Holly&#39;s the last one here who needs that.  But while that time is <br/>\nthere, you just have to ride it through.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I hadn&#39;t told Kirby no the times I did.

If <br/>\nI could do it again I would have made SURE to say yes to Kirby more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also remember being &quot;touched out&quot; when I had infants and toddlers and <br/>\nfeeling like the next time human skin touched mine I would have to burst into <br/>\ntears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I don&#39;t think we can see parenting or unschooling as something we can <br/>\nschedule around our own leisurely lives.  Maybe a time or two a week I would <br/>\ngo to a movie or help some other adult friend with a project for a bit, while <br/>\nyet another adult or teen hung out with my kids, or while they were out with <br/>\nanother family or my husband was home with them.  But not every day, by any <br/>\nmeans.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard but it has to be done.  Kids who are home instead of in daycare or <br/>\nschool need some direct and concentrated attention.

I know all of you with older kids will say, &quot;enjoy it&quot;.    <br/>\n <br/>\nI often have one in their bed pouting until I get to them,  it helps when dad is around!  They are figuring it out tho&#39; that mom will get to them.  And the pouting is getting less.   I think if we had a king sized bed alot of our problems would be solved.    We&#39;ve been doing alot of juggling of sleeping quarters lately and they seem to be more secure in themselves during the day.   I had never heard of the Continuum Concept until this year!!   Some nights I&#39;m with a dd,  my dh is with another dd or our son is on our floor.  Things like that.     <br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as getting things done,  can the kids help?   I know sometimes it can be stressful,  but if you aren&#39;t in any hurry to get the finished product done by a certain time...    I know I had quite a bit to do with Thanksgiving,  and my 8dd wanted to do things with me, she helped me make pie crusts and other things.  My kids try to help me clean, but that&#39;s always a work in progress!&lt;g&gt;    <br/>\n <br/>\nBut I do also know that I need some time just to myself also and that is hard to do with young children,   my husband knows when its time to get the kids out and about.  Meaning..&quot;lets leave Mom alone now for awhile&quot;.   I think,  everyone needs that time.   Most the time I just need to let my dh know when I&#39;m needing it, now if I were an organized person there would be a certain day scheduled for that, but...<br/>\nAnother thing that is hard for me is asking for help,  you know, I can do it all!!   Noone can.<br/>\n <br/>\nTake a deep breath, and breath,    oh....the kids and I did yoga together the other day,  that was really fun.   Although I have to do my own also during an &#39;alone&#39; time.  (which is hard to find).<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard all this before but I hope it helps and I&#39;m sure the more experienced listers will have words of advice!<br/>\nTake Care,  and oh, I&#39;m up in the wee hours because our big tree (Christmas)  that I thought I wanted,,    fell over,  woke me up.   Thugggggg!!  Need a bigger stand.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m back to bed!<br/>\n <br/>\nOh,  And I&#39;ve been doing alot of Christmas decorating,  can you tell.  Nitey nite!!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\nkayb85 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a>&gt; wrote:I have a question.
