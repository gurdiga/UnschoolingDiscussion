There was <br/>\na time when I felt like there were just bad kids and no matter how loving <br/>\nand nurturing and &quot;right&quot; parents were, some kids just went bad on their <br/>\nown. Now I&#39;m more on the side of yes, each one of us has our own way about <br/>\nus but there is something that we as parents can do to make situations <br/>\nbetter or worse. I certainly don&#39;t expect any kid to be perfect and make no <br/>\nmistakes, no matter how good a parent is. But I&#39;m thinking that how kids do <br/>\nturn out may have a very big part in how we parent. Not 100 % sure on this <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSurf the Web without missing calls!
