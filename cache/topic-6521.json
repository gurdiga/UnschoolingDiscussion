It&#39;s been wonderfully eye-opening to read such<br/>\na breadth of beliefs, and I hope that everyone still feels welcome on the<br/>\nlist. None of us would have had the chance to &quot;meet&quot; folks from such diverse<br/>\nbelief systems in our day to day lives, and I value hearing from all of you.<br/>\nAnd Wini, I loved your response. I too, try to simplify things around here,<br/>\nand battle the consumerism that seems to creep up from some awful place in<br/>\nmy brain.
