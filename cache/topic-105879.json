He said it was like a castle <br/>\nof a house, and he was only in the basement and the kitchen, but the basement <br/>\nwas a huge rumpus room, and a bedroom, and two bathrooms, and the house had an <br/>\nelevator, but it was broken, and. . .  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was acting that all out with his arms and making big eyes, and I said, <br/>\n&quot;Why are his parents rich enough to have a house like that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI expected him to say they owned land or a car dealership, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>\nDoctors. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said, &quot;Maybe they invented Toaster Strudle.  Who knows?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI laughed and told him to have a good time, but I wondered after he left <br/>\nwhether &quot;Toaster Strudle&quot; came up because that&#39;s what he ate in their castle-like <br/>\nkitchen. &lt;g&gt;  We&#39;ve never had it here.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is funny, and Kirby&#39;s funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105877,"nextTopicId":105885}}
