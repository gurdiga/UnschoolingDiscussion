I didn&#39;t mean to be! <br/>\nAs someone said, e-mail is challenging bc we don&#39;t see each others faces<br/>\nand hear our tones of voice.  I too, am just sharing my view and hoping<br/>\nto learn more along my own parenting journey.<br/>\nWe never know when we state our views if others will say &quot;I agree&quot; or &quot;I<br/>\ncan&#39;t believe you think that way&quot;.  But we would never learn anything new<br/>\nif people didn&#39;t speak up when they don&#39;t agree with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to thank you, Faith, for sharing why you feel as you do.
