When HE chose to start moving more, changing his <br/>\neating, etc, I researched health clubs, water aerobics, treadmills, <br/>\nfound lower sodium or fat versions of favorites, looked up recipes <br/>\nfor him, etc - he&#39;s the head chef in our house so my task was to <br/>\nmake sure the resources were available for him to do stuff like <br/>\nperfect his really tasty low sodium heart healthy vegetarian chili. <br/>\nIn the process, we talked about things like sodium, protein, fat, <br/>\netc. Since DS (6 1/2) is living life right alongside us, he learned <br/>\nabout what sodium and potassium do, what fat/cholesterol do, etc. He <br/>\ncan read and make sense of label packaging and he requested we post <br/>\nlists of protein foods and potassium foods (since potassium is the <br/>\nbalance to sodium). I also asked him one time when he was bouncing <br/>\noff the walls and getting in my face if he wanted a PBJ or some <br/>\ncheese because I had noticed that having some protein snack helped <br/>\nhim keep his own self more comfortable (he said when asked to stop <br/>\nwhat he was doing that he -couldn&#39;t stop himself-).
