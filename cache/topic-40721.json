He enjoys <br/>\nhunting, which I think is fine. The problem with his guns isn&#39;t his guns, the <br/>\nproblem is he is always spouting off about how if he isn&#39;t vigilant, *they* <br/>\nare going to take away his rights. He has a real problem with these people he <br/>\nrefers to as *they* and *them* He has to watch out for them, they are going <br/>\nto take his rights away. His favorite saying is &quot;*They* can have my gun when <br/>\n*they* pry it from my cold, dead hand!&quot; If my uncle wasn&#39;t so gung ho about <br/>\nhis rights, and always shouting about the ever-present *they* and *them* <br/>\ntaking away his rights, then the *they* and *them* probably wouldn&#39;t care so <br/>\nmuch about him. What he doesn&#39;t realize is that *they-them* aren&#39;t after his <br/>\nhunting rifle locked in his safe. For every action there is a reaction. My <br/>\nuncle is part of that equation, he doesn&#39;t have to be. <br/>\nI think that keeping an eye on the law is a good thing. What I don&#39;t think is <br/>\na good thing is getting on my horse and riding around proclaiming that my <br/>\nhomeschooling rights are about to be violated. There is an old saying. Don&#39;t <br/>\nrock the boat. I have it good here, I am thankful. I wish it were the same <br/>\nfor all, but I know it isn&#39;t. (I am sure some in states that don&#39;t have it as <br/>\neasy as I do might think that I am being selfish. And maybe I am.) I am not <br/>\nwilling to run around screaming about something that *might* happen, calling <br/>\nattention to what I do legally, just asking for some hot head to hear me and <br/>\nsay that they DON&#39;T like what I do, and make it harder or even illegal for me <br/>\nto do what I do. I am thankful for those who have gone before me on this <br/>\nroad. I am grateful for the battles they fought and won. They made it <br/>\npossible for me to enjoy the freedom I have to raise my kids the way I feel <br/>\nis best. I am not going to stand up and shout about a system they helped <br/>\ncreate, risking loosing what I do have. Is that wrong? Maybe. Is it an <br/>\nungrateful attitude toward those who went before me? No. So when I say if <br/>\nhomeschooling were to become illegal, I would do it anyway. I guess I mean <br/>\nthat, like those who did this before me, I would do it anyway, but thanks to <br/>\nthem, I don&#39;t need to draw attention to myself, and in deference to them, I <br/>\nwon&#39;t. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2223 - homeschooling  illegal","postDate":"1029088683","msgId":40721,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5N0JERURFLjEyQjAlbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjg5NTc0NTcuMTM2Ny4xMTAzMS5tMTNAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40746,"prevInTime":40720,"nextInTime":40722,"topicId":40721,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 8/10/02 1:30 AM, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com wrote: ...

That would be a terrible thing, and not just for<br/>\nhomeschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 25 years ago, homeschooling was illegal in several states. There were<br/>\nsheriffs at many homeschoolers&#39; doors demanding that children be sent to the<br/>\nlocal public schools, and many children were actually forcibly taken away<br/>\nfrom their homes and put in foster homes for various terms, and parents were<br/>\n&quot;detained&quot; too. Many homeschoolers lived in fear of the pedagogical police.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings have changed on the surface, but we&#39;re far from safe. A legislator in<br/>\nCT has told her constituents (including homeschoolers to their faces) that<br/>\nshe intends to do everything she can to eliminate parents rights to educate<br/>\ntheir kids.
