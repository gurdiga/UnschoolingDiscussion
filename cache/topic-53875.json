(I believe, though not <br/>\nentirely positive, that they are Japanese, Chinese, Korean and French) ( mine <br/>\nwas Korean) and in addition to that (and for that reason) our  (high) school <br/>\noffers more Language&#39;s then others, because students are offered the chance <br/>\nto study these language&#39;s at an earlier age.unfourtatly, while my school was <br/>\ngreat for the Korean kids. they didn&#39;t ooffer anything other then French or <br/>\nSpanish to us. when I got to the high school, I learned that I had the <br/>\nopportunity to take Japanese (as one of the first classes). I Immediately <br/>\njumped at the chance. My dad (who&#39;s American) lived in Okinawa Japan on the <br/>\narmy base when he was little. And my mom traveled to Japan and studied the <br/>\ntea ceremony. ( they actually met though a mutual love of Japanese culture). <br/>\nWhile neither of my parents Actually speak Japanese (in about 4 weeks I <br/>\nsurpassed my dad&#39;s knowledge lol) they were very glad I would get the <br/>\nopportunity to study it. I was very nervous at first, because I had heard <br/>\nthat Japanese was quite hard. I actually found Japanese not to be any harder <br/>\nthen French after my initial struggle to learn the alphabet (s) ( hiraganga <br/>\nand katakana) and my teacher was absolutely fabulous. ( actually, she was not <br/>\nJapanese and Japanese was her second language but she was highly proficient)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53872,"nextTopicId":53835}}
