I<br/>\ntried to make it fun and exciting, but it was still led by me. I<br/>\nwanted her to do certain things every day or every week.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally I realized that it wasn&#39;t really &#39;fun&#39; for either of us. I<br/>\nstill had anxiety about whether I was doing everything right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings changed for us when we started reading the fourth Harry Potter<br/>\nbook out loud. We were so into it that we sometimes read for the whole<br/>\nday. Seriously, it was hard putting the book down long enough to make<br/>\nmeals, my throat started getting so sore. LOL <br/>\n<br/>\nI found myself justifying this to myself. We are homeshoolers we can<br/>\ndo what we want. As this went on I started believing myself, we can do<br/>\nwhat we want truly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am finding that when I am interested in something and spend time<br/>\nmyself on learning what I want to learn it opens Kaya up to explore<br/>\nwhat she wants to learn and sometimes our interests coincide. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I am very interested in geography, finding out exactly where<br/>\nthings are in our world. I have maps on every wall of my living room.<br/>\nWe are literally surrounded by the world. I find it very exciting and<br/>\nKaya has picked up on that and wants to learn as much as she can. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in school there were so many things being crammed into my<br/>\nhead that I was uniterested in; I remeber very little about those<br/>\nthings. I don&#39;t use chemistry in my everday life, but I am finding<br/>\nthat there are situations where algebra would come in handy. While I<br/>\nwas not interested when I was in school, now I want to learn it and so<br/>\nwill put energy into doing so, not because someone is making me, but<br/>\nbecause I can see how it would be helpful in my life. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchools turn out a remarkably uniform product.
