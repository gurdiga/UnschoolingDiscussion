He has been taking &quot;violin&quot; lessons for about 2 years and doing pretty good.  We&#39;ve changed teachers twice(the first time our choice, then that teacher stopped teaching so the school assigned us a new teacher).  He never complains about going to his lesson, but he never touches his fiddle outside of class anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the question.  Can you give me more info about the type of things Holly practices?  What book is she using, what CD&#39;s are her &quot;required&quot; listening.  Dillon is never asked to listen to anything, but his teacher is Asian and frankly doesn&#39;t know anything about roots music.  She is very good with Dillon and is more than willing to teach his music that we bring to her.  Luckily his dad loves roots music and Dillon listens daily to all sorts of fiddlers and other musicians.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI  just talked to Dillon about his lessons the other day.  He says that he wants to keep going to lessons although he feels that practicing is too much like a chore (I remind him rather than force him).  I&#39;ve tried to find a fiddler to teach him with no luck (although we live in the Blue Ridge Mtns).  Dad takes him to shows and introduces him to the musicians (Dad is a taper and knows lots of them that way).  Dillon even asks me why I think fiddling feels like a chore.  I&#39;ve asked him what he thinks, I&#39;ve offered ideas and reinforced that learning to fiddle is his choice and I will do what I can to make it work for him.  But that if he has tired of it or changed his mind it&#39;s okay to stop.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny other ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54218,"nextTopicId":54319}}
