I tend to assume that everyone must have a 6<br/>\nyear old, because I do. &lt;g&gt;  Also, I probably underestimate how much older<br/>\nkids actually &quot;need&quot; their mother when she&#39;s busy weeding.  Certainly yours<br/>\nare old enough to make their own sandwiches and tie their own shoes &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nwhich are the things that I get interrupted for.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, having you deeply involved in weeding does create a great time<br/>\nfor them to come out and talk to you.  With older kids, I&#39;ve heard the best<br/>\ntalks come at times when you aren&#39;t staring too intently into each others<br/>\nfaces  -- like in the car, or doing dishes together.  I think this is<br/>\nespecially true for boys, who don&#39;t want to let down their guard if you are<br/>\nactually facing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14764,"nextTopicId":14745}}
