I will work with her on these points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kids who were grounded have gotten pregnant, run away, and murdered their <br/>\n&gt; parents (not all at the same time, as far as know).

It&#39;s a reaction mom had to  seeing <br/>\nher child get burned.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMom slapping the hand away or saying spitefully, &quot;SEE!  That&#39;s what  happens <br/>\nwhen you touch a hot stove!&quot; is NOT a natural consequence.  It&#39;s  spitefulness <br/>\nand meanness and stating the obvious and treating the child like  they don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a brain.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNatural consequences can be way more complicated than my simplified  example. <br/>\n The idea is to go for the principles behind cause and  effect.  The <br/>\nprinciple is about being empowered to make choices that will  lead to the desirable <br/>\nconsequences.  You don&#39;t have to let your child  suffer consequences of their <br/>\nmistakes.  It&#39;s better to help them recognize  and think ahead what the <br/>\nconsequences might be, to interact with them to help  them make their choices, while <br/>\noptimizing good consequences and minimizign the  negative ones.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46250780,"authorName":"denise perri","from":"denise perri &lt;de_perri@...&gt;","profile":"de_perri","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"What is natural consequence and what is not?","postDate":"1133279920","msgId":110308,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTI5MTU1ODQwLjUyOTU5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjM0MTEyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMzMyNjg1OTAuNTY5LjE1OTM3Lm0xN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":110312,"prevInTime":110307,"nextInTime":110309,"topicId":110308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s confusing sometimes for me to figure out what is natural and what is not in regards to consequences.
