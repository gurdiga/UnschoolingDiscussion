As for Wyndham, left to his own obsessive nature, he would<br/>\nwatch TV and eat until he was an obese lump on the couch.  When we tell<br/>\nhim to shut it off and go find something else to do, there is usually not<br/>\na struggle over it (if there is, we talk about it and forge a compromise<br/>\nbecause he usually just really wants to see something and is waiting for<br/>\nit to come on.  We just tell him we&#39;ll tell him when it&#39;s time in that<br/>\ncase and he is happy.  Then we do tell him.)   But when he does turn it<br/>\noff, he does go find something else to do.
