It would really apply to them and maybe help.       It would be even cooler if they would read it, &lt;g&gt;  but I don&#39;t know them and don&#39;t know if this would happen or not.    I know my son won&#39;t read a whole lot that I recommend,  too much pushing a few years ago,  we are still deschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nRegarding your reporting stuff ,   have you contacted other homeschoolers/unschoolers in your state?    They will know what is really needed and will probably know what a portfolio can look like.<br/>\n <br/>\nI just keep telling my family that has concerns,   &quot;I  can&#39;t believe how much we are learning,    its amazing how much an individual learns in their everyday life!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nKeep having fun with your kids!  And I hope this helps<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michele-nappi@...\">michele-nappi@...</a> wrote:I would like some help, please:) I am still working on immediate family<br/>\nmembers that believe school &quot;should look like school.&quot; They including my<br/>\nolder teen and 21 year old who are no longer in school, think I should<br/>\nsit my two young sons down for atleast 2 hours a day and have them<br/>\nwrite.
