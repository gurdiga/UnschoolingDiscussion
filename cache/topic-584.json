What this means is that if your child&#39;s birthday is in November, <br/>\n&gt; you do not need to do ANYTHING until the FOLLOWING year, when she would be 8 <br/>\n&gt; at the school entry deadline.  Does that make sense?  Another way.  If your <br/>\n&gt; dd turned 5 in November, she would not have attended school that year, as the <br/>\n&gt; cutoff date is Sept. 18th(?).  So, apply that rule to when she turns 8, and <br/>\n&gt; that is when you need to register, and test.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Mary,<br/>\nO.K., I just want to make sure I have this right.
