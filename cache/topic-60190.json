In our family, as opposed <br/>\nto the family I and my Dh grew up in, we try to make decision and to do <br/>\nthings together. We each grew up in families were the parents were the <br/>\nultimate authority and were the children should be seen but not heard. <br/>\n It was normal for their generation, and I realize that it is still <br/>\nnormal for a lot of family out there.<br/>\n And yes, empowering  people  makes them powerful.  Commanding them <br/>\nmakes them small and dependent.  Schooling is a commanding and <br/>\ncontrolling system.  Unschooling  perhaps imply that it is not.<br/>\nBut I also get the feeling (wrongly perhaps)  that some parents want to <br/>\ngo from one extreme to the other.  Instead of all the control in the <br/>\nhand of  one or two parents they have no control, Chaos?  No commanding <br/>\nsystem can mean that the activities are accomplished and decided by <br/>\nconsensus or never together.  I prefer consensus.  I find other <br/>\noptions... lonely.  Beside I love doing things with my sons.<br/>\nDid I make more sense?   Anyway, they&#39;re waiting for me to go shovel <br/>\nmore snow.  Bye for now.<br/>\nLucie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60188,"nextTopicId":60193}}
