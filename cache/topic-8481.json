I know these children<br/>\n&gt;from the<br/>\n&gt;Berkeley YMCA, where they swim, play basketball, join group arts and<br/>\n&gt;crafts<br/>\n&gt;projects, and generally are a part of the community. Please read and<br/>\n&gt;circulate this letter - it is a lesson in the absurd, and it could<br/>\n&gt;happen to<br/>\n&gt;anyone. Patty is a down to earth older mother who gave birth to twins<br/>\n&gt;at age<br/>\n&gt;45 after long term infertility, and she has been following the<br/>\n&gt;Independent<br/>\n&gt;Studies curriculum supervised by the Berkeley Unified School District.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Needless to say this has not increased my respect for the child rescue<br/>\n&gt;establishment. Homeschooling is not the only item that could generate<br/>\n&gt;such a<br/>\n&gt;bizarre set of events - any over-zealous neighbor or social worker who<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t like your religion or lack thereof, your family bed, your<br/>\n&gt;letting<br/>\n&gt;children play naked in the backyard, your messy house, diet, longterm<br/>\n&gt;breastfeeding, style of dress or choice of family acctivities could<br/>\n&gt;get<br/>\n&gt;something like this nightmare going. Official documents blame<br/>\n&gt;Ptaricia for<br/>\n&gt;using &quot;manipulative charm&quot; with the children because she told<br/>\n&gt;them, &quot;Smile<br/>\n&gt;and tell the truth if anyone asks you questions.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please note that a legal defense fund has been established on Patty&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;behalf<br/>\n&gt;- if you or anyone or any group you trust could contribute even a<br/>\n&gt;little, it<br/>\n&gt;would be wonderful. Thanks, friends, Judith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------<br/>\n&gt;From: pattypink@s...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear Lori and Friends,                          5/11/00<br/>\n&gt;  ( This is typed into the computer and sent for Patricia by Anne<br/>\n&gt;Marie.<br/>\n&gt;Patricia is in bed with a migraine headache but wanted  to update<br/>\n&gt;those<br/>\n&gt;concerned. )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;======================<br/>\n&gt;Patricia has said:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear Friends of Nils and Hans,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you for the love and support your email and calls offer. The<br/>\n&gt;support I<br/>\n&gt;get  gives me great strength and courage to continue. I welcome<br/>\n&gt;correspondence<br/>\n&gt;from anyone who has advice to offer,  or comments about this<br/>\n&gt;situation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I began today with &quot;The Lord is my shepherd, ......&quot;  This morning<br/>\n&gt;one of<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;neighbor kids came by to say &quot;Are you going to see the boys today?<br/>\n&gt;Would you<br/>\n&gt;say &#39;Hi&#39; for me?&quot; I assured him I would and recited the the prayer<br/>\n&gt;for him.<br/>\n&gt;He<br/>\n&gt;said he had never heard it! I think back to those many times I<br/>\n&gt;repeated it<br/>\n&gt;over and over as a child his age going to Sunday school.  I knew I<br/>\n&gt;would get<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;red  bible bookmark with my name and the Lord&#39;s Prayer on it in gold<br/>\n&gt;letters<br/>\n&gt;as soon as I could say the whole thing. I was the same age as my boys<br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;now<br/>\n&gt;when I memorized it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;MInutes later my 82 year old Buddhist landlady  asked me to come in<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;chant<br/>\n&gt;with her for a few minutes at her alter. She loves my children just<br/>\n&gt;like her<br/>\n&gt;own  great grandchildren that Hans and Nils played with daily. She is<br/>\n&gt;broken<br/>\n&gt;hearted by this tragedy. She misses the hugs the boys gave her every<br/>\n&gt;day.<br/>\n&gt;Both<br/>\n&gt;Hans and Nils call her Grannie Annie. She is impatient to get into<br/>\n&gt;court and<br/>\n&gt;give those people her opinion about all of this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After a few kind words from Grannie Annie I  left to see my children<br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;visit<br/>\n&gt;#3. It was wonderful to hug them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;*****They tell me my sons will be moved to another foster home and<br/>\n&gt;enrolled<br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;public school next Monday.*****<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They have no glasses. They have not had needed fillings and teeth<br/>\n&gt;cleaning.<br/>\n&gt;They said they miss me in the morning when they wake up and need a<br/>\n&gt;hug from<br/>\n&gt;me. &#39;They told me they love me and want to come home. We read a book<br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt;rocks and minerals and learned about the hardness scale: Diamonds 10,<br/>\n&gt;Quartz<br/>\n&gt;7, Talc 1. They decided to start a rock collection. We joked and<br/>\n&gt;laughed. We<br/>\n&gt;all three managed somehow not to cry.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All ages, sizes, and shapes of people who worship in many ways are<br/>\n&gt;sending<br/>\n&gt;their love to my children at this time. And it will take a lot of<br/>\n&gt;love to<br/>\n&gt;overcome this terrible thing. I send my deepest gratitude to everyone<br/>\n&gt;who<br/>\n&gt;has<br/>\n&gt;written, prayed, chanted, called, emailed etc to share their love<br/>\n&gt;with our<br/>\n&gt;family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I will try to send out updates after our weekly visits. Please send<br/>\n&gt;us your<br/>\n&gt;love at 10 am Thursdays when we will hug-hug-hug and be a family<br/>\n&gt;united<br/>\n&gt;again<br/>\n&gt;for a few all too short moments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In Hope,<br/>\n&gt;Patricia Moodian-Pink<br/>\n&gt;========================================<br/>\n&gt;========================================<br/>\n&gt;Other information for those have have asked:<br/>\n&gt;The family&#39;s attorney has a trust account to hold funds for the<br/>\n&gt;family&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;legal<br/>\n&gt;defense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Any donations to help huge huge legal costs to<br/>\n&gt;  bring the boys home may be made by check payable to:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Mr. David Beauvais,  Attorney for Patricia/Hans/Nils Moodian-Pink<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;and mailed to his law office at:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1840 Woolsey,   Berkeley CA 94704  USA<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He may be reached at (510) 845-0504   where he will be very busy<br/>\n&gt;trying to<br/>\n&gt;prepare this complicated case and do all of the necessary legal<br/>\n&gt;procedures<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;get Nils and Hans released.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you would like to  talk about the case and have general questions<br/>\n&gt;Patricia<br/>\n&gt;can be reached late evening at (510)666-0411. Or you can write to her<br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;POBox<br/>\n&gt;2632, Berkeley, CA 94702. If you get her 24 hour voice mail leave a<br/>\n&gt;number<br/>\n&gt;where she can call you back collect or even better an email address<br/>\n&gt;she can<br/>\n&gt;write to you at. Her phone bill is huge now due to this case and she<br/>\n&gt;says<br/>\n&gt;she<br/>\n&gt;can not afford to call you  unless you would accept a collect call if<br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;out of her area code. Patricia welcomes all communication. She<br/>\n&gt;realizes her<br/>\n&gt;case is not isolated, and can set a precedent for other families.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A little legal defense fund Benefit is hoping to happen here in<br/>\n&gt;Berkeley.<br/>\n&gt;Two<br/>\n&gt;excellent Berkeley bands have already volunteered to play at it.<br/>\n&gt;Children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;entertainers are invited  to volunteer. We need a small, free place<br/>\n&gt;to hold<br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt;where a band could set up and play on a Sunday afternoon, printing,<br/>\n&gt;advertising etc. If any one is interested in helping or has<br/>\n&gt;suggestions<br/>\n&gt;please<br/>\n&gt;contact Patricia<br/>\n&gt;&lt;pattypink@s...&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;----------<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Freedom of Speech is a Precious Right.<br/>\n&gt;  Don&#39;t let anyone take away yours or mine.<br/>\n&gt;Children are Precious.<br/>\n&gt;Don&#39;t let anyone take away yours or mine.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;                    [from Patricia Moodian-Pink 5/11/2000]<br/>\n&gt;---------<br/>\n&gt;For those who may have missed it -<br/>\n&gt;  from the original paperwork to remove and hold the children:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Quotes from Screener Narrative before children removed on 4/20/2000:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;The children are homeschooled and never allowed out of her sight.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;Mom has totally isolated the minors and allows them no contact with<br/>\n&gt;anyone<br/>\n&gt;but her.&quot; &quot;...at risk environment of the minors.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  (These are totally false allegations about two socially active<br/>\n&gt;children<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;are well integrated into their community.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &#39;Screener Narrative&#39; recommendations:           &quot; 3. The children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enter public school next year, or as soon as their mental health and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; development allows.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Their own records and documents prove what they did to remove the<br/>\n&gt;children<br/>\n&gt;These documents exist,  no matter how they try to squirm around after<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;fact. No matter what else they do in new petitions after the wrongful<br/>\n&gt;detention, those words are, in fact, quotes from documents used to<br/>\n&gt;remove<br/>\n&gt;the children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In an effort to keep from antagonizing the court Patricia is asking<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;neither the worker nor the court be contacted at this point. That<br/>\n&gt;could<br/>\n&gt;change<br/>\n&gt;in the future depending on many things. For now she is concerned that<br/>\n&gt;they<br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt;only have her children but could take away the one hour closely<br/>\n&gt;supervised<br/>\n&gt;visit per week that she is allowed with them.  She also does not want<br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;a gag order placed on her so that she is not even allowed to update<br/>\n&gt;others<br/>\n&gt;on<br/>\n&gt;what is happening. In their petitions they tried to get the court to<br/>\n&gt;order<br/>\n&gt;her<br/>\n&gt;not to talk to anyone &quot;in the best interest of the minors.&quot; Patricia<br/>\n&gt;is very<br/>\n&gt;grateful to all who have shown concern for the children.<br/>\n&gt;--- End forwarded message ---<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8480,"nextTopicId":8484}}
