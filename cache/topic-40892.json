She sends all of her children to school at age 6, (the <br/>\nlast of four attending this year) but when she had pre-schoolers in <br/>\nthe grocery store she would always say she &quot;homeschooled&quot;!    Drives <br/>\nme crazy!<br/>\nSomeone asked about historical fiction for younger boys?  Two of my <br/>\nsons have learned to read BECAUSE of the Childhood of Famous <br/>\nAmericans books about Kit Carson, Jim Bowie, Daniel Boone.  They <br/>\nlove the outdoors so much and want to be real wilderness men.  Both <br/>\nhave struggled with learning to read until about age 8, then we <br/>\nstarted reading this type of book out loud, and soon they were <br/>\nreading them themselves.  My 9-year-old is just getting to that <br/>\npoint, it has been three years of using &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; (tried <br/>\nHooked on Phonics borrowed from the library, and yuck, we hated it!)<br/>\nbut the real &quot;catch&quot; in learning to read came when they discovered <br/>\nbooks they really wanted to read themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, anyone else really miss &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary from IA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40891,"nextTopicId":40876}}
