Once an egg hatches, it takes (I believe) 8 to 10 days for <br/>\nthe louse to begin laying eggs itself.  So if you treat the child, then treat <br/>\nthem again in 7 days, (and maybe again a couple of days after just to be really <br/>\nsafe) you will kill any bugs that have hatched, but have not begun laying <br/>\neggs yet.

It was horrible!  We tried EVERYTHING!  <br/>\nThe only thing that we found to work was constant &quot;picking&quot; and olive <br/>\noil.  The olive oil is great because when you find a bug you can put <br/>\nthe bug in the oil, and they die instantly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing is to use a flushable cloth while pulling <br/>\neggs and bugs from the hair.  Put them all in the cloth and flush <br/>\nwhen you are done.  You can put the oil on the hair, and you don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to worry about harming your child.  It does help to eliminate <br/>\nthe bugs, but you MUST constantly pick through the hair.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t stress enough how important it is to pick thoroughly through <br/>\nthe hair.  Keep checking their heads daily for a week or two.  It&#39;s <br/>\nSO EASY to miss just one egg, and then the process starts all over <br/>\nagain.  It&#39;s a terrible chore!  Oh, another helpful hint is to look <br/>\nthrough their hair outside.  You don&#39;t have to worry about dropping <br/>\nany on the floor, and it&#39;s WAY easier to see in the sunlight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you the best of luck in this pain in the neck, literally, <br/>\nsituation.  We have seven kids, five girls that all had long hair.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s been years since we&#39;ve been through it, but I still have the <br/>\nmessed up fingertips to prove it.

We could go into the library, grocery store and even sit at the drugstore <br/>\nsoda fountain barefoot. (And did, every chance we got, because these places were <br/>\nthe very first to be air-conditioned, when even our homes were not.)  Oh, and <br/>\nthe movie theatre was air-conditioned and very popular then; I don&#39;t remember <br/>\nanyone barefoot at the Saturday matinees, and I always had on shoes myself, <br/>\nbut it was mostly dark so who knows? <br/>\n<br/>\n       I had spectacular accidents while barefoot as a child in a culture <br/>\nwith that laid-back attitude toward kids and shoes. I don&#39;t mean mere bee stings, <br/>\nalthough after a half-dozen you might think I would have put on shoes. &lt;grin&gt; <br/>\nSeems like everybody had mosquito and chigger bites all over (not a barefoot <br/>\nissue) but also ringworms were common, which I always understood came from <br/>\nrunning around barefoot where animal feces had deposited the rascals.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nvouch for the truth of this, it wasn&#39;t something I ever looked into or <br/>\ncontracted myself -- we&#39;d just hear our moms mention that so-and-so was being dosed for <br/>\nworms again but what could you expect in the summer when everyone was <br/>\nbarefoot?<br/>\n<br/>\n       I had two real injuries stepping on metal and being carted off to the <br/>\nemergency room to be stitched up (and yes, to get another tetanus shot.) A <br/>\nrusty nail where you&#39;d least expect it,  and my grandmother&#39;s tin flower bed <br/>\nborder that I stepped backward onto (cutting my big toe to the bone) while washing <br/>\nthe car with a garden hose (a perfect time to be barefoot and great fun until <br/>\nthe blood started gushing!) I remember all the towels I soaked through in the <br/>\nback seat and how much the numbing shots right in the wound hurt, and being <br/>\nlaid up on the couch with my foot propped up on pillows watching through the <br/>\nbig window while everyone else played outside, barefoot of course -- <br/>\n<br/>\n       Also I was barefoot one time when three of us girls caught a horse <br/>\npeacefully grazing in the back pasture. I was trying to hold him without benefit <br/>\nof even a rope much less a bridle and reins, so we could climb on for a <br/>\nbarefoot-bareback ride, and got my foot broken when a hoof came down on it. I doubt <br/>\nthat shoes would have made much difference that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n       So there&#39;s plenty to worry about. You should see the size of the bugs <br/>\nand lizards here, even in the garage and sometimes in the bathroom! But <br/>\nnothing requires us to live terrified, in a tizzy, or to ruin everyone&#39;s fun. It is <br/>\nwhat it is. And even in the South, the world is different now, The <br/>\nall-barefoot, all-the-time world is gone but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mainly because of fear <br/>\nand spoilsport parenting. I&#39;d guess that liability laws, the rise of the car <br/>\nculture, and the South&#39;s population explosion have more to do with it. <br/>\n<br/>\n       For us personally, the air-conditioned house and unschooling has a lot <br/>\nto do with why my kids -- now 8 and 14 -- never incurred any of these <br/>\nbarefoot ill effects, not even one bee sting. They do enjoy being in the grass <br/>\nbarefoot, but generally they don&#39;t spend nearly as much time outside as I did as a <br/>\nchild (we were always shooed outside but never shoed outside , LOL)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1278341,"authorName":"Ann and Eric Yates","from":"&quot;Ann and Eric Yates&quot; &lt;hooperck@...&gt;","profile":"mumsienc2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion]bare feet  WAS:  risk, danger and freedom","postDate":"1083939578","msgId":93638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMjQwMWM0MzQzZSQ1Nzc1MDUwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBtb20+","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQtREFWMTI1UFhGMmFaY2QwMDAwMDc2M0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDAwMDMwMWM0MzQwZCRhOWUzOTRlMCQ4YjRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0PiA8NDA5Qjg2RjguODA3MDAwOUB0aGV3aW5vbmFmYXJtLmNvbT4gPDAwNDkwMWM0MzQzNyRmYTQxZDMwMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93635,"nextInTopic":93643,"prevInTime":93637,"nextInTime":93639,"topicId":93494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve always wondered this myself.

Most of the parents I know get in a tizzy because their kids might &quot;step on something&quot; sharp.  Tetanus comes to mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But my kids ran in barefeet even in winter.

No parents but me. The boys had their sneakers off and Catherine saw this, figured that was how it was done and slipped hers off to play. A little while later I got curious and asked the boys why they weren&#39;t wearing their shoes and one replied that they slid a lot better down the slide without them and the round gravel felt really good on their socked feet. Very good reasons I thought. I can just imagine the mess a couple  of controling parents might have made of that situation. A situation where all involved were happy, polite and having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94040812,"authorName":"Lisa H","from":"&quot;Lisa H&quot; &lt;Lmanathome@...&gt;","profile":"lmanathome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"risk, danger and freedom  WAS: Swimming and Unschooling - Anything to Share?","postDate":"1083757930","msgId":93494,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtREFWMTI1UFhGMmFaY2QwMDAwMDc2M0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93610,"prevInTime":93493,"nextInTime":93495,"topicId":93494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam wrote:  Yesterday the girls I took to the playground (4 & 6)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-34103927\">Pam wrote: &lt;&lt;we better understand the desire our kids have to take some risks in their lives.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday the girls I took to the playground (4 & 6) immediately took off their shoes.
