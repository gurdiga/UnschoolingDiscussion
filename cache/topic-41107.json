Did ya&#39; see that lightning strike ?<br/>\n<br/>\nTina describes the way many parents feel. The idea is that if a kid isn&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;studying&quot; something, time is being wasted, and the kid&#39;s future is in<br/>\njeopardy. That&#39;s fear tactics.  Sheila&#39;s advice (&quot;don&#39;t bug him about not<br/>\n&#39;studying&#39; something&quot; ) agrees with a great deal of evidence on child<br/>\ndevelopment that says kids don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to study stuff, they need to freely<br/>\ninvestigate their surroundings on their own terms -- that&#39;s called play, and<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t mean &quot;organized sports&quot; (necessarily).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened (above) was that Tina recognized that it was she herself who<br/>\nneeded to unlearn the false assumptions that &quot;educators&quot; want us all to<br/>\nbelieve -- that we NEED their services and that they know how to raise our<br/>\nkids better than we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me add to Sheila&#39;s elegant post:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had two sets of kids. One set (twins, b&g, went to a variety of<br/>\nschools, mostly the public, and came out stressed badly and not knowing much<br/>\nat all -- even fearful of learning. The other, a boy ten years younger,<br/>\nnever set foot in a school (except Montessori briefly when he was 4 and<br/>\ndropped out on his own - he quit at 4 ! - and also took a night class in<br/>\nconverstational French when he was 12. A French woman spoke French and in<br/>\neight sessions he learned to speak that language better than I had learned,<br/>\ntaking French for six years every day in a &quot;good&quot; private school) and<br/>\nlearned everything in sight -- without a moment of stress or unhappiness or<br/>\ncoercion or anyone telling him what to think or do or -- least of all --<br/>\nstudy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe transition from being required to study things that don&#39;t interest a<br/>\nperson to becoming interested/curious in something by one&#39;s self is<br/>\ndelicate. School makes learning compulsory, and therefore onerous. . . it is<br/>\non other people&#39;s terms and there will be tests, so you don&#39;t even know<br/>\nwhich information is important and which is not. That creates stress, and<br/>\nchanges learning from an enjoyable experience into a threatening one. It<br/>\ntakes kids a while to see that learning can be enjoyable experience, once it<br/>\nhas become a &quot;duty&quot; done for gold stars or other people smiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t need incentives to learn about things that interest them. But<br/>\nschools give &quot;rewards&quot; and soon kids only learn for the &quot;rewards&quot; instead of<br/>\nthe joy and satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvice: Give the boy things like maps, real tools -- such as tape measures,<br/>\nmicroscope, magnifying glass, binoculars, a sewing machine, paint, have a<br/>\njunk yard bring a wrecked car and put it in your yard. etc. Those are toys<br/>\nfor people who do real things. He will play with them. (don&#39;t tell him what<br/>\nto do with them, though, just make them available, visible) He just needs<br/>\naccess to the real world, he&#39;s 10. Life is long.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41113,"nextTopicId":41118}}
