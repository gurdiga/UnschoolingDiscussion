She had just really been getting into playing<br/>\nwith baby dolls and I had given her one that had been mine when I was<br/>\nlittle (she had made a trip to the doll hospital and was ready to be<br/>\nplayed with again).  I was getting the kids in the car after grocery<br/>\nshopping and was holding my daughter&#39;s doll upside down by a leg.  I<br/>\nlooked up at one point because I heard some one yelling.  I saw this<br/>\nhuge man coming at me yelling!  As soon as he got right up next to our<br/>\ncar, he said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s a doll!&quot;  He apologized and left red faced.<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t the only time this doll has been mistaken for a real baby.<br/>\nThanks for the trip down memory lane.<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42201,"nextTopicId":42007}}
