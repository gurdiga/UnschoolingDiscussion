I grew up with blizzards and cold so I know how to deal with them.  If it&#39;s cold outside you put on more layers, if it&#39;s too warm you can&#39;t do anything about it but dampen down and get used to it.  Having my car break down in the desert would freak me out though.  I&#39;ve read enough to know to stay in the car and shade all the windows and some other things, but I don&#39;t have the life experience to go along with it(confidence.  I wouldn&#39;t mind living somewhere like BC on the coast or interior where it&#39;s a little more temperate but so do a few thousand other people so it&#39;s too crowded for me.
