He<br/>\n&gt; likes rocks. He has collected them since he was little. Since this is<br/>\n&gt; something he is interested in, what exactly do I do now? I am waiting for<br/>\n&gt; our library to get a book about experiments with rocks (it is checked out<br/>\n&gt; at the time). He doesn&#39;t seem interested in reading books about rocks<br/>\n&gt; really because most of these are too encyclopedia-like to catch his<br/>\n&gt; interest. When it warms up, I plan on taking him rock hunting. Is this<br/>\n&gt; along the lines of what I am supposed to be &quot;doing&quot; as an unschooling parent?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Buy some books on rocks and put them on the shelves so that if he wants<br/>\nthem, they&#39;re there. He might mention something about a rock and you could<br/>\nlook it up in the book, or on the internet, and tell him what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy some cool flat bins, or make a nice planter area outside, where he can<br/>\ndisplay his rocks. Offer him paint in case he&#39;d like to paint some, for<br/>\nhimself or as gifts or to decorate the yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee if there are geology videos for rent and watch them so you learn more<br/>\nabout rocks yourself (if he wants to watch them with you, great! If not, at<br/>\nleast you&#39;re a little more &quot;up&quot; on his interest).<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t do all this in one afternoon. &lt;g&gt; And if he isn&#39;t clamoring for rock<br/>\nexperiments, drop the idea like a hot rock. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t try to make rocks into school, or learning, or his life&#39;s mission. If<br/>\nhe likes rocks, pay attention while he talks about them, admire how he<br/>\ndisplays them, tell him what you like about them and let him tell you.<br/>\nSuggest any or all of the above ideas and be ready to be told, &quot;nah, not<br/>\ninterested&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe respectful of the fact that it&#39;s his thing, not yours, and while you are<br/>\nwilling and able to help, you are also willing and able to NOT help, or take<br/>\nit over and make it yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58358,"nextTopicId":58341}}
