I think this discussion has included so many people, and has had <br/>\na few different directions. I do agree with the ones who said that in <br/>\ndealing with state regs, the key is to unschool, and find a way to <br/>\ncomply without compromising how you unschool. That&#39;s good, imho. ( btw, <br/>\nI was two days behind on email, and prob should have read all of it <br/>\ninstead of responding as I went. :-)  I guess I get a little impatient, <br/>\nor invovled and want to jump in.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe part about whether or not it compromises unschooling to even be <br/>\naware of the schools -- that means different things to different people, <br/>\napparantly. Some took that to mean knowing exactly what was actually <br/>\nbeing taught, scope and sequence and all that. To me, it&#39;s more of an <br/>\ninterest in the culture of schools, and how it affects the people caught <br/>\nup in it. I look at homeschoolers, esp. unschoolers, and think how great <br/>\nit is. Then I look at public schools, and think, there must be a better <br/>\nway. But while we can, one family at a time, step away from the schools, <br/>\nhow does an entire culture step away? What about all those kids there? <br/>\nBut then, I guess my interest in, concern for, the schools and who&#39;s in <br/>\nthem really isn&#39;t part of unschooling. The other side is, my kids bump <br/>\ninto ps kids all the time, so we do bump into the ps culture, in a way. <br/>\nMy kids ask lots of questions, and notice the difference in how kids <br/>\ninteract.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this discussion, is it was actually a couple of <br/>\ndifferent discussions under one header. I wasn&#39;t trying to defend my <br/>\nconcerns, actually. I like to feel like I was clear, and if someone <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get what I said, I look at it to see if I could have explained <br/>\nmyself more clearly. Also, I was sort of enjoying this discussion, <br/>\nbecause it brought out a lot of different viewpoints, and I do think the <br/>\npoint (Sandra, I think?) about not compromising what you&#39;re doing to fit <br/>\nstate regs is very important. Also, if you can&#39;t unschool in your state, <br/>\nthen what? A few times I saw moving suggested. I do think this is an <br/>\nimportant issue --- why should someone in a country supposedly about <br/>\nfreedom and the individual have to move? There is something seriously <br/>\nwrong if the government is telling us how to raise our children, and <br/>\neven if we don&#39;t live in that state, I do think it is everyone&#39;s <br/>\nconcern. Another state could look at that and think it&#39;s a good idea, or <br/>\nno one objects, or any other excuse to further curb our freedoms.<br/>\n<br/>\nsorry, rambling again. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for the note,<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, December 19, 2002, at 08:38  AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Susan,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think most of us understood your concern with &quot;being aware of what is <br/>\n&gt; going<br/>\n&gt; on in school&quot;   I know I certainly didnt interpret that as you being <br/>\n&gt; involved<br/>\n&gt; or worried about what your PS system does.  You already clarified what <br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; said, I don&#39;t know why others keep insisting that &quot;being aware&quot;   means<br/>\n&gt; anything more than just that.. an awareness.     Don&#39;t discount your <br/>\n&gt; concerns<br/>\n&gt; or feel like you have to defend them.  They are real and we all have to <br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; ways to deal with them.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teresa<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
