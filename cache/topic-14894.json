What struck me most was when you said<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now you must understand, this is very difficult for me. My whole<br/>\n&gt; adult life has been devoted to teaching. So yes, my world has been<br/>\n&gt; shaken. But I&#39;m very open-minded and I love my son very much. I want<br/>\n&gt; him to have the best &quot;education&quot; - what ever that may be. But I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; extremely nervous about unschooling. It&#39;s against my instincts, or<br/>\n&gt; should I say &quot;conditioning.&quot; And to make things more difficult, my<br/>\n&gt; entire family expects me to take control and make my son learn. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been feeling a bit overwhelmed and confused. My head is saying, &quot;sit<br/>\n&gt; him down and make him learn,&quot; while my heart is saying, &quot;let him do<br/>\n&gt; what he has always done and just be there to help.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes it is &quot;conditioning.&quot;  I used to get worried that we weren&#39;t doing<br/>\nenough.  I have since realized that when I insist on &quot;work&quot; it isn&#39;t because<br/>\nI am worried anymore, it is a control issue.  If I feel that I am not able<br/>\nto do things that I want to do, I often start telling others what to do.<br/>\nKeep in mind that you do have a lot of conditioning to overcome.  I always<br/>\nremember that if I can do it, then my children won&#39;t have to when they are<br/>\ngrown. :)  They will have had the wonderful experience of learning in their<br/>\nown way, enjoying life in the present and not experience childhood as some<br/>\ntraining station for adulthood.  I have many times found myself in the<br/>\nposition of saying, &quot;That won&#39;t work, do it this way&quot; only to be proven<br/>\nwrong.  I realize it is my creativity which has suffered from being taught,<br/>\nnot they who are suffering from not being taught.  Life is not formulaic, so<br/>\nwe can&#39;t have a formula for wht everybody should know, should not know.  We<br/>\ncan only listen to our children&#39;s needs and desires and help them acomplish<br/>\ntheir own goals. After a while, you will have watched your son accomplish<br/>\nsome amazing things, make the od statement, or suddenly jump in some area of<br/>\ninterest, and then you will know why so many are devoted to unschooling.<br/>\nI know that you will be thinking about this constanly and trying to work it<br/>\nout in your head.  It is a hard shift to make, but once it is made, once you<br/>\nsee children who have grown in this way (and it can take months or years to<br/>\nsee any outcome), there is no going back. It is so liberating and wonderful,<br/>\nfor parents as well as children. Good luck on your unschooling journey!<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nJulie<br/>\nPS  A friend said to me recently, everybody we know has started out<br/>\nstructured and gotten less so.  SOme people do school at home and stay<br/>\nthere, but NOBODY starts out with child-led learning in mind and gets more<br/>\nstructured. IME this is true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; How do you handle it? Do you ever have doubts or worry that you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; doing something that will be harmful to your child? How do you get<br/>\n&gt; past the conditioning that society has imposed on us? I really want<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; try unschooling, but it&#39;s a bit like jumping out of a plane.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Susan (mother to 5 in Fla)","from":"&quot;Susan &#92;(mother to 5 in Fla&#92;)&quot; &lt;samiot@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"7a0ePIn9GiQaHytVIDUHmmTBDVMOnjFOrWY-k0xD-XzWmPAeCDuTogP8Y34SSsPGNIEcT0EiWcfrINO3NHsiwRoS2NzCpWxCLOGTiOZirHRmXJ8jmZIlkR0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Nervous about unschooling","postDate":"978909013","msgId":14913,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5FQkJMT1BLQUxPQVBQSElBTU9FQ0VCT0NMQUEuc2FtaW90QGNmbC5yci5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEI2N0QzN0Y2LTJDNUUwQUA2My4zNi4yMDcuMTA+"},"prevInTopic":14910,"nextInTopic":14918,"prevInTime":14912,"nextInTime":14914,"topicId":14894,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s a site   http://hale.pepperdine.edu/~dbeveret/bklfintro.htm","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1540122556\">Here&#39;s a site   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hale.pepperdine.edu/~dbeveret/bklfintro.htm\">http://hale.pepperdine.edu/~dbeveret/bklfintro.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"aWGkWcepo2ngCcB1RTildQtGr8f8MmhABfhdSyoS2IhPDoXEc59R1iXH7amiWZE2Ns-KLs2JGrHjrXffpz62qPEHGt5kTUy56Db5UaAUEOfFbydlWQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Nervous about unschooling","postDate":"978898754","msgId":14910,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBNThDRjQyLjIyNDI2LjFFNDgyQjVAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMDQwMWMwNzg1MiRkODE2ZDQwMCQ0NjFjOTNhOEBpZm5ldC5lZHU+"},"prevInTopic":14909,"nextInTopic":14913,"prevInTime":14909,"nextInTime":14911,"topicId":14894,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can empathise, here, I know how hard it is to listen to my heart when my head is saying the opposite, and vice versa, even though I know which one makes most","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1525032513\">I can empathise, here, I know how hard it is to listen <br/>\nto my heart when my head is saying the opposite, and <br/>\nvice versa, even though I know which one makes most <br/>\nsense.

This reminded me of Christmas dinner at my in-law&#39;s. We&#39;re the<br/>\nonly ones in the family who homeschool (they don&#39;t even know what &quot;unschool&quot;<br/>\nmeans). Everyone else is big into ps or Montessori. Somehow it came up to my<br/>\n7 yo niece that my kids don&#39;t go to school. This was beyond her<br/>\ncomprehension. Her mother teaches at the same Montessori she attended and<br/>\nthey are completely entrenched in conventional educational ideas. So the<br/>\ngirl&#39;s grandmother says &quot;Their mommy teaches them.&quot; To which I stupidly (aka<br/>\nhonestly) reply &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t teach them. They just learn on their own.&quot;<br/>\nStunned silence. Then they decide I&#39;m kidding and laugh and we all have more<br/>\ndinner. I figure, why get into it?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I know he is incredibly smart and interested in the world.<br/>\nI&#39;ve witnessed this his whole life. So I&#39;ve come to the conclusion<br/>\nthat he just doesn&#39;t like to be taught.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere you go. My husband and I realized at some point (while still in high<br/>\nschool) that we learned more on our own than we ever learned in school. So<br/>\nunschooling came rather naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now you must understand, this is very difficult for me. My whole<br/>\nadult life has been devoted to teaching. So yes, my world has been<br/>\nshaken...How do you handle it? Do you ever have doubts or worry that you&#39;re<br/>\ndoing something that will be harmful to your child? How do you get<br/>\npast the conditioning that society has imposed on us? I really want<br/>\nto try unschooling, but it&#39;s a bit like jumping out of a plane.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve always wanted to skydive.) You sound like an ideal unschooling parent:<br/>\nYou love your son and wants what&#39;s best for him. You know he learns very<br/>\nwell on his own. You know &quot;teaching&quot; just spoils the process. But there&#39;s<br/>\nthose pesky relatives and those ingrained ideas. Well, reading Holt and<br/>\nothers will help you deschool. (Do you subscribe to Home Education Magazine?<br/>\nI highly recommend it.) As for the relatives...do they need to know<br/>\neverything? There&#39;s very creative ways to get around the &quot;what did you do<br/>\nfor school today?&quot; questions. When someone asks my kids that, they always<br/>\ncome up with an avalanche of things they&#39;ve been doing, completely unaided<br/>\nby me. Just take it day by day. Hang out on these lists. Have fun with your<br/>\nson. If he&#39;s interested in something, get him materials.

It&#39;s been so exasperating <br/>\nbecause I know he is incredibly smart and interested in the world. <br/>\nI&#39;ve witnessed this his whole life. So I&#39;ve come to the conclusion <br/>\nthat he just doesn&#39;t like to be taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you must understand, this is very difficult for me. My whole <br/>\nadult life has been devoted to teaching. So yes, my world has been <br/>\nshaken. But I&#39;m very open-minded and I love my son very much. I want <br/>\nhim to have the best &quot;education&quot; - what ever that may be. But I&#39;m <br/>\nextremely nervous about unschooling. It&#39;s against my instincts, or <br/>\nshould I say &quot;conditioning.&quot; And to make things more difficult, my <br/>\nentire family expects me to take control and make my son learn. I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen feeling a bit overwhelmed and confused. My head is saying, &quot;sit <br/>\nhim down and make him learn,&quot; while my heart is saying, &quot;let him do <br/>\nwhat he has always done and just be there to help.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you handle it? Do you ever have doubts or worry that you&#39;re <br/>\ndoing something that will be harmful to your child? How do you get <br/>\npast the conditioning that society has imposed on us? I really want<br/>\nto <br/>\ntry unschooling, but it&#39;s a bit like jumping out of a plane.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"&quot;Elizabeth Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XCDn-pI1n9PuXWxJV7J5mej5Dci_eZbz64MDUfZg9AhCKErkWX9ROpgHY1zgx7d8AmecHdb3eNkWDhp3q9nQpQktOPoinfbIEEwLDY7RRYRw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Nervous about unschooling","postDate":"978814824","msgId":14903,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2N0QzN0Y2LTJDNUUwQUA2My4zNi4yMDcuMTA+"},"prevInTopic":14900,"nextInTopic":14904,"prevInTime":14902,"nextInTime":14904,"topicId":14894,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
