One <br/>\nquestion I always ask my boys is this some place that you would approve of <br/>\nCait going?  That usually stops them in their tracks.  They are very <br/>\nprotective over their sisters and over each other really.  If the response is <br/>\n&quot;no, she&#39;s too young&quot;, then I say, well then you might want to ask Sarah if <br/>\nshe wants to go with you (dd23).  If they still think it&#39;s not a place for <br/>\ntheir sisters, they are much more likely to examine the reasons why they <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel it&#39;s appropriate for the girls and when they express those <br/>\nconcerns, I just tell them those are the same concerns I have about you <br/>\ngoing/doing whatever it is that bothers me.  Many times they will just not do <br/>\nit because now, since it&#39;s THEIR thoughts on the not so good aspects of it, <br/>\nit&#39;s easy to see why it&#39;s not such a good idea.  Before they were probably <br/>\nhearing only the reasons for going/doing whatever it is because a friend or <br/>\nfriends told them how great it was going to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard sometimes to be a parent, I know.  Just try to keep telling <br/>\nyourself when it is hardest to love them and their thoughts and actions, it&#39;s <br/>\nalso probably when they need loving the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Another parenting question  (was Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TheChristian A...","postDate":"1050440778","msgId":64990,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTcwMWMzMDM5MiRkYzEwMjUyMCQ3YjdlNTI0NEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwNC4yYzJlYTVkYS4yYmNkMTBjOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64993,"prevInTime":64989,"nextInTime":64991,"topicId":64990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A kid who can t drive himself is never going to be guaranteed of a ride to a place where the driver doesn t want to go.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1991394125\">A kid who can&#39;t drive himself is never going to be guaranteed of a ride to a <br/>\nplace where the driver doesn&#39;t want to go.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept when he has friends that DO drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64583,"nextTopicId":64886}}
