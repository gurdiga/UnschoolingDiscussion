But mostly, unmotivated to choose her own things to <br/>\ndo. She<br/>\noften  comes to me with the &quot;Mom, I&#39;m bored&quot; thing. I will give her <br/>\nsome<br/>\nideas, and she usually asks me to choose. I often wonder if I <br/>\nhave too<br/>\nmany things available to her, making it tough for her to make a <br/>\ndecision.<br/>\nDoes anyone else have this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I worked with La Leche League years ago (was a leader <br/>\nfor ten years), I used to notice a couple of extremes in the <br/>\napplication of total breastfeeding. One was that the mother <br/>\nbecame so consumed with responding to every single need of <br/>\nthe baby, (fearful that the baby would be damaged if it ever cried <br/>\nor fussed) that she became tired and resentful of the little baby <br/>\nfor doing what it does naturally--and that is, cries for attention <br/>\nand milk. Usually this mom would neglect other children, the <br/>\nhome and spouse all to prevent a fussy baby. The second <br/>\nextreme was that the mother felt that if she deviated from the <br/>\nphilosphy of &quot;demand feeding&quot; at all, that she was a bad mother. <br/>\nThis kind of mom often rebounded into a scheduled approach to <br/>\nnursing with the next baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut does that mean that demand feeding isn&#39;t best for the baby? <br/>\nNo. But it also doesn&#39;t mean that if a baby sits in a swing or uses <br/>\na pacifer or is rocked to sleep by dad that the mother has <br/>\nsuddenly abandonned her original philosophy either. Common <br/>\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think moms forget that we are a part of the relationships we <br/>\nnurture. We do have a responsiblity to express our own needs <br/>\nand to see that they get met while still meeting those of our kids. <br/>\nAs adults, we are better at delaying the gratification of our needs <br/>\nthan our children are, so we should be more clever in how we <br/>\nmeet both their needs and in how we preserve our sanity. <br/>\nCommon courtesy and mutual respect are part of being in a <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say that your daughter comes to you bored, that is a <br/>\nvery real emotion. But it isn&#39;t your job to solve it, even though it <br/>\nfeels like it is. It&#39;s your job to support her during her boredom <br/>\nwith a hug and comments like: &quot;Wow. I hate being bored. I bet <br/>\nyou do too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen get back to work on the thing that is engaging your <br/>\nattention. Or invite her to help you out, if that&#39;s appropriate (in our <br/>\nhouse, boredom can always be overcome with housekeeping if <br/>\nsomeone wants to go on and on about it).<br/>\n<br/>\nBoredom is a precursor to meaningful discovery and <br/>\nengagement. But not if it is assuaged too quickly with a pacifier <br/>\n(&quot;Here, draw this.&quot; or &quot;Have you read this book?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me that one of the misconceptions of unschooling <br/>\nmay be that we are responsbile to make sure that our kids don&#39;t <br/>\nsuffer or have negative emotions--life should be continually full. <br/>\nBut it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie~~who is screwing her courage to take the same leap of <br/>\nfaith with teens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

AND WHAM!!!  I <br/>\nthought how horrible to tell a child he shouldn&#39;t be bored!  My mom used to <br/>\ntell me I wasn&#39;t hungry.   Or &quot;That&#39;s not anything to be unhappy about.&quot;  And <br/>\nI thought telling a kid he had no right to be bored had to be just the same <br/>\nkind of thing, so I quit right then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other things I&#39;ve learned out of the swirl of idea-exchanges like <br/>\nthis, and one of the other life changing ones for me was people saying that <br/>\nif they wanted their houses to be a certain way that was THEIR problem.  And <br/>\nI hadn&#39;t seen it ever as &quot;a problem&quot; before (although I&#39;m not a good <br/>\nhousekeeper, and really quite a packrat).  I thought wanting a clean house <br/>\nwas right and normal and justifiable and commendable, and the fact that I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t figured out how to do it meant I was some kind of slacker who had no <br/>\nskill to be that organized.  Maybe that latter part is true, but I no longer <br/>\nbelieve that the former is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I want the dishes done, I just do them!  And I&#39;m SO much happier <br/>\nthinking &quot;I did the dishes because I felt like it!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have hard water and so calcium forms in and around sink fixtures, and the <br/>\ntoilets get rings of calcium from mineral water.  I bought a <br/>\npumice-on-a-stick toilet cleaning tool and went after the two worst toilets <br/>\nand made them look new.  I didn&#39;t even tell anybody.  If they notice, fine; <br/>\nif not, fine.  I *THINK* they don&#39;t care one way or another.  But for me, it <br/>\nwas like a secret difficult project, and I was glad to have my leg well <br/>\nenough that I could do something like that.  I don&#39;t think anyone wiped a <br/>\ntoilet off while I was immobilized, but they also didn&#39;t die of germ-borne <br/>\ndiseases, and they were all VERY great taking care of me, so rather than rise <br/>\nup and shame them about their lack of desire to scrub toilets, I cleaned <br/>\ntoilets while thinking how grateful I was to have a happy family without a <br/>\nbunch of stress and fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@bravewriter.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bordeom/Was--Re: Intro and a confession","postDate":"1041880541","msgId":53365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF2Y2trdCtmb2VuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0ZS4xOWM4MDVkNy4yYjRiMDljOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53335,"nextInTopic":53373,"prevInTime":53364,"nextInTime":53366,"topicId":53318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... than I ...

I liked <br/>\nthe idea. When a child comes to me seeking advice on how to deal with any <br/>\nemotional state, I&#39;m flattered and glad for the opportunity. <br/>\n<br/>\nTraditionally in this culture boredom is seen as a state of sin. “I’m bored” <br/>\nis met by unthinking parents with, “Then mop the kitchen,” or “You have a <br/>\nthousand dollars’ worth of toys, you can’t be bored,” or “Boredom’s good <br/>\nfor you.” I believe the VERY common habit of belittling children who use the <br/>\nword “bored” should be rethought (or “thought,” since it seems many parents <br/>\nhave never considered it carefully but just repeat what their parents said to <br/>\nthem). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child came and said she was heartbroken would you tell her she was a <br/>\nbrat and should clean the garage? If a child came and said he was angry <br/>\nenough to hit would you say, “Then sit down and read a book whether you want <br/>\nto or not”? Wouldn’t you try to help them? It&#39;s nonsensical to me that some <br/>\nparents shame their children for saying they are at a loss about what to do <br/>\nnext. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most to be accomplished from punishing or sending bored kids away is that <br/>\nthe kids will learn not to go to that parent for advice and ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the real message behind &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is &quot;I&#39;m little and feeling <br/>\nagitated and vaguely unhappy and I don&#39;t know what I can do to get over this <br/>\nuncomfortable feeling. What would you do if you were my age, in this house, <br/>\non a day like this?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that deserves a helpful, respectful response. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is rare that my children say, “I’m bored,” but when they do I walk with <br/>\nthem where they are, or to some other part of the house, thinking quickly <br/>\nabout what I might have that they have never seen, or haven’t seen for a <br/>\nwhile. I think of art supplies or games or toys or musical instruments they <br/>\nhaven’t thought of for a long time. I scan my mind and the house for things <br/>\nwhich would provide some visual, auditory, olfactory, or mental stimulation, <br/>\npreferably two or three of those. Tactile stimulation is good too--perhaps <br/>\nthe offer of a shower or bath with new/different toys, or different soap or <br/>\nsomething. Sometimes “watering the yard” (playing with the hose) will do. <br/>\nWhen a baby cries for no clear reason, parents will often joyfully see <br/>\nwhether the baby means “I’m uncomfortable.” They’ll try a change of <br/>\nclothes, physical contact, a change of temperature, more air, less air, hot <br/>\nfood, cold food, a stroll outside, a car ride, SOMETHING different. Older <br/>\nkids have the same needs, and the expression of that need might come through <br/>\nas whining, irritability, or a claim of boredom. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it’s not physical need, but intellectual need. Boredom is a desire for <br/>\ninput which unschooling parents should welcome. It’s a child saying “How can <br/>\nI add excitement to my life?” This can be a big opportunity to introduce a <br/>\nnew subject, activity, or thought-collection. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it’s an emotional need, and the parent’s undivided attention for a <br/>\nlittle while will solve the problem. A walk, some joking, a hug, inquiries <br/>\nabout progress on the child’s projects or plans or friends might serve many <br/>\npurposes at once. If after a walk and a talk the child is not quite <br/>\nrefreshed, you still had that time together, which made “I’m bored” a useful <br/>\ninvitation to bonding. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes “bored” means tired, low on energy, needing a break from conscious <br/>\nthought and responsibility. Arranging a nap, or putting on a soothing video <br/>\n(even for older kids--a romance instead of an action flick, or light drama <br/>\ninstead of comedy), leaving a pillow on the couch and herding the rest of the <br/>\nfamily in other directions might result in an unplanned but needed nap. <br/>\n<br/>\nI’m grown. I still get bored occasionally. Thinking about why I’m bored and <br/>\nforgiving myself for being bored have helped me assist my children in <br/>\nlearning some coping skills they can use in their own lives. I have also used <br/>\nmy occasional boredom as a trigger to seek out the kids. If there’s a lull in <br/>\nmy life now I should fill it with those children who will be gone too soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome opportunities to learn about when and why your child asks for your <br/>\nadvice and stimulation. The threshhold of needing the parent will change over <br/>\ntime, and parents can really use knowing where it is and seeing the benefit <br/>\nin it. One complaint of parents of school kids is that communications are <br/>\nlacking or are misunderstood. Homeschoolers have the fulltime luxury of the <br/>\nchance to do better. Unschoolers have the added advantage of “counting” <br/>\nevery interaction as a learning experience. Self awareness, interpersonal <br/>\nskills, creativity and compassion all come into play when a child and a <br/>\nparent can build an uplifting memory from “I’m bored.”</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@bravewriter.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bordeom/Was--Re: Intro and a confession","postDate":"1041862909","msgId":53318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF2YzNkdCthZDE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":53335,"prevInTime":53317,"nextInTime":53319,"topicId":53318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Wende.

She<br/>\noften  comes to me with the &quot;Mom, I&#39;m bored&quot; thing. I will give her <br/>\nsome<br/>\nideas, and she usually asks me to choose. I often wonder if I <br/>\nhave too<br/>\nmany things available to her, making it tough for her to make a <br/>\ndecision.<br/>\nDoes anyone else have this problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I worked with La Leche League years ago (was a leader <br/>\nfor ten years), I used to notice a couple of extremes in the <br/>\napplication of total breastfeeding. One was that the mother <br/>\nbecame so consumed with responding to every single need of <br/>\nthe baby, (fearful that the baby would be damaged if it ever cried <br/>\nor fussed) that she became tired and resentful of the little baby <br/>\nfor doing what it does naturally--and that is, cries for attention <br/>\nand milk. Usually this mom would neglect other children, the <br/>\nhome and spouse all to prevent a fussy baby. The second <br/>\nextreme was that the mother felt that if she deviated from the <br/>\nphilosphy of &quot;demand feeding&quot; at all, that she was a bad mother. <br/>\nThis kind of mom often rebounded into a scheduled approach to <br/>\nnursing with the next baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut does that mean that demand feeding isn&#39;t best for the baby? <br/>\nNo. But it also doesn&#39;t mean that if a baby sits in a swing or uses <br/>\na pacifer or is rocked to sleep by dad that the mother has <br/>\nsuddenly abandonned her original philosophy either. Common <br/>\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think moms forget that we are a part of the relationships we <br/>\nnurture. We do have a responsiblity to express our own needs <br/>\nand to see that they get met while still meeting those of our kids. <br/>\nAs adults, we are better at delaying the gratification of our needs <br/>\nthan our children are, so we should be more clever in how we <br/>\nmeet both their needs and in how we preserve our sanity. <br/>\nCommon courtesy and mutual respect are part of being in a <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say that your daughter comes to you bored, that is a <br/>\nvery real emotion. But it isn&#39;t your job to solve it, even though it <br/>\nfeels like it is. It&#39;s your job to support her during her boredom <br/>\nwith a hug and comments like: &quot;Wow. I hate being bored. I bet <br/>\nyou do too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen get back to work on the thing that is engaging your <br/>\nattention. Or invite her to help you out, if that&#39;s appropriate (in our <br/>\nhouse, boredom can always be overcome with housekeeping if <br/>\nsomeone wants to go on and on about it).<br/>\n<br/>\nBoredom is a precursor to meaningful discovery and <br/>\nengagement. But not if it is assuaged too quickly with a pacifier <br/>\n(&quot;Here, draw this.&quot; or &quot;Have you read this book?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me that one of the misconceptions of unschooling <br/>\nmay be that we are responsbile to make sure that our kids don&#39;t <br/>\nsuffer or have negative emotions--life should be continually full. <br/>\nBut it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie~~who is screwing her courage to take the same leap of <br/>\nfaith with teens.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53885,"nextTopicId":53889}}
