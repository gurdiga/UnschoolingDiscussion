(they <br/>\nneed to do a two day pass or something--I&#39;ve seen many a family practically <br/>\ndrag the kids from one exhibit to the other, trying to get it all in)<br/>\nNot to snub my nose at the one here in NH, but when other Children&#39;s Museums <br/>\nare located in an old house with only a handfull of exhibits--wow, I&#39;ve <br/>\nrealized how good a museum Indy has...<br/>\n(do I sound a little &quot;homesick&quot; for the museum?!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana<br/>\n&quot;the world is our classroom&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Diana Asberry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diasberry@...\">diasberry@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nReply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Indy Children&#39;s museum<br/>\nDate: Mon, 19 Jul 1999 13:50:11 PDT<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Diana Asberry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diasberry@...\">diasberry@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRichie Woods is the Children&#39;s Museum&#39;s nature &quot;park&quot;.
