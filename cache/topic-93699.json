Below you&#39;ll<br/>\nfind my story regarding av stuff in our house, but I&#39;m not able to be with<br/>\neach of them as I was before we started tv/video games since they&#39;re<br/>\nsplitting up around the house.  My ds is loving the video games, while my<br/>\ndaughter wants to garden with me in the sunshine.  I&#39;m feeling so torn!  And<br/>\nthen there&#39;s the 2 year old that&#39;s either running in between or wrecking<br/>\ntheir projects (in their minds) etc.  Before tv/video games, we would often<br/>\ndo crafts together at the table, etc. and I would at least *feel* like I was<br/>\nspending time with them.  How have other parents balanced their time with<br/>\neach of their children?  Is it the squeaky wheel?  Inviting them to be near<br/>\nyou?  Taking turns which child you are spending time with?  In increments of<br/>\ntime, or until games or mini-projects (is - planting her flower) is done??<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have been transformed lately by moving towards letting go of controlling<br/>\nmy kids lives, and letting them make their decisions.  I was doing that<br/>\nalready in many areas of their lives, however I was very controlling when it<br/>\ncame to tv, video games, and videos.  I have completely switched, now<br/>\nletting them play/watch whenever they want.  They were thrilled!  I&#39;m<br/>\ndefinitely going through growing pains, at the same time feeling really<br/>\nsurprised by some of the positive fallouts that I hadn&#39;t anticipated - such<br/>\nas much more open communication, more open processing of feelings with my ds<br/>\n(video games are either *really* frustrating or *really* exciting - gives us<br/>\nlots of opportunity).  I&#39;m still having reservations, but I&#39;m trying to just<br/>\n*be* with this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Michele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93675,"nextTopicId":93703}}
