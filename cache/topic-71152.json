So, I ask. <br/>\nSometimes if he says no at first, and I REALLY am sure, I tell him a bit more, and <br/>\nhe trusts me, even if he&#39;s not sure. On those times, I have NEVER been wrong, <br/>\nand they&#39;ve become real passions for him. But we both know it comes from my <br/>\npaying LOTS of attention to him and knowing him really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my role in unschooling for him is that I already know more about the <br/>\nworld, and I can share that. I have resources he doesn&#39;t. But I share.

THAT doesn&#39;t work for anyone. But, you know, <br/>\n&gt; structure. Like, a load of laundry a day and shine your sink every <br/>\n&gt; day. Or, run the vacuum twice a week.

He has decided to set times for himself several <br/>\ndays a week that he calls &quot;study halls,&quot; in which he does some sort of <br/>\nacademic-y thing -- reads some history or literature, sometimes does some math on a <br/>\ncd-rom. He decides what to do and how long. Recently he added practicing his <br/>\nguitar every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was not my idea; it was his, and he&#39;s very happy with it. He also <br/>\noccasionally takes classes or does programs locally, like through MIT, and he has <br/>\nguitar lessons. So there&#39;s a bit of structure. But he does it because  for his <br/>\nown reasons (he felt that it was too easy JUST to play computer games or JUST <br/>\nread certain kinds of books without doing the other stuff he liked more <br/>\nintentionally.) and his own way. My role, at his request, is to put his &quot;study hall&quot; <br/>\ntimes in my calendar and remind him if he forgets. <br/>\n<br/>\nStructure isn&#39;t a bad thing...many people find it really useful, and my Virgo <br/>\nchild is one of them. The difference is that it&#39;s his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71000,"nextTopicId":71151}}
