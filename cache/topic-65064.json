I know he&#39;ll grow out of the<br/>\n  bathing thing,  but is there anything that could make these things be<br/>\n  soothing to him instead of stressful?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n    Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n      From: zenmomma2kids<br/>\n      To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n      Sent: Thursday, April 17, 2003 10:14 AM<br/>\n      Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: kids and sensory needs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      &gt;&gt; The tags in his shirt might be bothering him.<br/>\n      &gt; For both me and Holly, I take tags out completely, of underwear and<br/>\n      &gt; especially t-shirts.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n      Casey hasn&#39;t met a tag yet that she likes. ::RIP:: They&#39;re outta<br/>\n      there. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yesterday she got completely thrown off for awhile by the sunscreen.<br/>\n      I watched it happening as we applied it to her face.
