This list has something like 500 members. Look at how<br/>\n&gt; many of those members regularly post. Do the numbers look a little bit skewed to you?

It&#39;s simply about time for me these days.  I used to be vocal on several big lists, some of them fairly contentious.  These days I&#39;ve dropped off all homeschooling lists but this one, and most of my<br/>\nwriting lists because these days I don&#39;t have the time to participate fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t unsubbed from *this* list because so many of the people who DO find time to continue writing here have so much to say that is worth my time to read.  I&#39;m more interested in hearing from people who have enough conviction or passion to speak than from the ones who are cowed or intimidated into silence for fear of<br/>\nstepping on toes or having their statements questioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no problem with using my delete key either, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for speaking up here, guys.  It&#39;s invaluable.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenie<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  If we somehow end up with all 500 speaking I&#39;ll have to unsub here too.  &lt;g&gt;  Every large list I&#39;ve ever been on had more people who&#39;d come to take than give.  I know when I&#39;ve gone to topica or yahoo looking to join it was because I had something to learn, and I&#39;ve been grateful every time I found a list offering what I<br/>\nwas looking for.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25493,"nextTopicId":25938}}
