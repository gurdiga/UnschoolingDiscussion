I had hamsters when I was \nyoung, but I must admit was pretty niave about them and their care. Then right \nbefore my husband and I got married we got one and surprise! three days later it \nhad babies. I held on to them (or at least the ones the mom didn&#39;t eat) for 5 \nweeks then brought the whole litter and mom and cage to the pet store, put ti \ndowna and walked out. Part of me felt bad, but I really felt that I had fufilled \nmy obligation and we we&#39;re leaving for our honeymoon. O.K., now that I&#39;ve made a \nshort story long.. my 7 yo dd now wants a hamster, so&nbsp; now that I&#39;m older \nand more responsible (sometimes), I&#39;m doing my homework. My 2 biggest concerns \nare determining the sex of the hamster before we buy it (especially making sure \nif it&#39;s pg or not) and what to do about our dog and cats. We&#39;re already planning \non keeping them in her room, but I&#39;m worried they might sneak in. Any \nsuggestions or advice appreciated.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">ThanksAmy<br>Mom to Samantha, Dana, and \nCasey</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11914,"nextTopicId":11918}}
