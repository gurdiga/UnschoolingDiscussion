My daughter still likes to sleep in our room on the floor next to our bed.  We&#39;ve been using a feather mattress, but it is so bulky and hard to clean up and store.  I&#39;d like to get one of these chairs for her since they are lightweight, easy to move, and store.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110308,"nextTopicId":110358}}
