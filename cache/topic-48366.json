Our first two years of <br/>\nhomeschooling we used a place like this for a computer class, some preschool <br/>\nfun stuff and tumbling.<br/>\nOh, and a sciency kind of class where we planted a garded, grew earth worms, <br/>\nmade tea from herbs and so on.....<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, there are programs, like those in Alaska, where the public school <br/>\nenrolls homeschooled children and shares the funds they receive for that <br/>\nchild with the parents.<br/>\nYou get reimbursed for anywhere from 1200-1400 dollars worth of supplies, <br/>\nwhich sounds wonderful. My sis bought a trampoline, they got a computer, art <br/>\nsupplies, cool science stuff etc...<br/>\nBut every year the restrictions get worse and worse.<br/>\nMost of the people are running schools in their home and grading their child.<br/>\nThe worst part is you can&#39;t leave the program after you have spent some of <br/>\nthe money.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47042,"nextTopicId":48106}}
