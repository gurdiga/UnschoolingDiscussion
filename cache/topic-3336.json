You need to get away more often.  What<br/>\nkind of a retreat was it.  I belong to Aglow, a non-denominational, Spirit-filled<br/>\nwomen&#39;s orginization.  They have spring and fall retreats each year.  They also<br/>\nhave national and international retreats.  It is a huge, world wide<br/>\norginization.  I come back so refreshed and ready for whatever fiery darts come<br/>\nat me, if you know what I mean!<br/>\n<br/>\nRetreats are definately a God send!

I did a lot of praying about the <br/>\ncondition of my home and my family while I was away.  As I drove up to my <br/>\nhouse, I noticed 5 big black garbage bags out front.  And when I came up to <br/>\nthe door, the kids all came out of the house, bathed, wearing clean clothes, <br/>\nand with their hair combed out.  Mark did a great job with them.  The 5 <br/>\ngarbage bags barely made a dent in the mess here, but it showed me that he <br/>\nwas making an effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prayed with him last night, which I haven&#39;t done in a long time.  I prayed <br/>\nwith the kids this morning.  We picked up all the dirty laundry from the <br/>\ndownstairs&#39; floors together -- 3 laundry baskets full.  Then I folded the <br/>\nclean laundry (4 baskets) and each person put away their own clean clothes -- <br/>\nand closed their dresser drawer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did not cook tonight, because the kitchen was still a mess.  I ordered <br/>\npizza with my last $20.  But then Sheila (age 7) and I cleaned the kitchen -- <br/>\nwashed all the dishes, picked up all the garbage, washed the counters, stove <br/>\nand fridge.  Then Sheila wiped down the table.  We carried more clean laundry <br/>\nupstairs (3 baskets), folded them and put them away.  The Sheila helped me <br/>\ngather up dirty clothes that were laying around the floor upstairs (4 <br/>\nbaskets).  In case you lost count, that means I currently have 7 baskets of <br/>\ndirty laundry to be done, and we still have 4 rooms to go through upstairs.  <br/>\nUnfortunately, my washing machine is broken, so we have to wait until the <br/>\nweekend to go to the laundromat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought 4 more laundry baskets today at the dollar store, and 4 smaller <br/>\nbaskets for the kids&#39; toys.  Somehow I lost my broom, so I have to get <br/>\nanother one as soon as I have some more money.

I can&#39;t remember how many <br/>\nchildren you said you had,  but it sounds like you have a lot of <br/>\nlaundry.  If we had that many baskets full, nobody would have any <br/>\nclothes left to wear.   Seriously,  we have tried to simplify in many <br/>\nways.  One thing we did was clean out our closets and get rid of all <br/>\nthe extra clothes.  We saved what we really like and will wear and <br/>\nde-cluttered by getting rid of the rest.  We try not to have a lot <br/>\nmore than we really need.  This also helps with laundry because we <br/>\nonly have so many clothes and if they don&#39;t make it into the laundry, <br/>\nthey don&#39;t get washed.  It also helps us to be aware of who needs <br/>\nwhat.   I feel so much better with less clutter around,  but I still <br/>\nhave some work to do.  It likes to creep back in when I&#39;m not <br/>\nlooking.
