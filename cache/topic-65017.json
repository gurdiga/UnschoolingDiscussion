My children are 12, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, and 6 months.  I find <br/>\n  it difficult to maintain peace and happiness without some sort of daily <br/>\n  rhythm.  Our &#39;schedules&#39; are not set in stone, but I came to unschooling <br/>\n  from a Waldorf perspective and we really enjoy the daily flow of having a <br/>\n  guiding rhythm.  I say we because I see that my children benefit from <br/>\n  knowing what to expect in general.  Examples would be, mealtimes, nap/quiet <br/>\n  times, bedtimes, etc.  We don&#39;t so much have a certain time set by the <br/>\n  clock, but we do follow an evening ritual of baths, songs, stories, bedtime. <br/>\n    This may start at 6 in the evening or 8 in the evening, but we tend to <br/>\n  follow the same general path every night.  I find when we stray from this, <br/>\n  if I let them do their own thing and head off to bed whenever, they are all <br/>\n  quite fussy and we end up with a lot of fights.  (Not between the kids and I <br/>\n  but between the kids together.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  My oldest daughter (12) is not so much involved in this process, aside from <br/>\n  mealtimes, etc.  After three years of listening to me rave about Harry <br/>\n  Potter, she stayed up all night and read the entire first book till 4 in the <br/>\n  morning.  (She came to me today and told me she read it but wanted it to be <br/>\n  a surprise.  She also asked for book 2, lol.) I&#39;ve never said anything more <br/>\n  than how much I loved it but she was over my shoulder this week reading <br/>\n  about the video games you all have been discussing.  Guess that sparked her <br/>\n  interest!<br/>\n<br/>\n  My question is: Is it hindering to have such a daily rhythm?  If so, do you <br/>\n  have any suggestions in curbing the fighting and unhappiness that result <br/>\n  when no rhythm is involved?  Perhaps, had we not been doing this for so long <br/>\n  it might be different, but since we have been doing it for so long, I guess <br/>\n  it just seems natural to them.  On the rare occasion that I do hear a <br/>\n  compaint, such as nap/quiet time, I try to offer suggestions for things to <br/>\n  do, play outside (in this case they can be loud), quietly watch tv, play a <br/>\n  game, spend time with me cooking, reading, etc., etc.  The one thing I find <br/>\n  I must insist on is our daily quiet time.  If the older kids are loud in the <br/>\n  house while the boys and the baby nap, they don&#39;t sleep and end up being <br/>\n  extremely fussy throughout the rest of the day.  I&#39;m interested particularly <br/>\n  on any thoughts directly related to this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For us, the situation is working.  I just wonder what it looks like from an <br/>\n  unschooling perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warm Wishes,<br/>\n  Jennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n  PS. Re: Dealing with family<br/>\n  I decided to write my grandmother the letter Sandra suggested and will send <br/>\n  it out as soon as it has the flavor I&#39;m looking for.  I&#39;m trying to strike a <br/>\n  level-headed tone, while making my feelings clear yet avoiding being rude.  <br/>\n  It is HARD!  We have decided to rent a van Easter weekend (hubby will be <br/>\n  home- yay!) and head off to Scarborough Faire for their Easter Bash.  Sounds <br/>\n  like so much fun and I won&#39;t have to deal with the family.  All around a <br/>\n  great deal!!!

Something to do to get it off <br/>\nmy chest.  Maybe that sounds the same.  Put this way, the way you <br/>\nwrote it, it sounds completely different to me.  It is so hard to <br/>\nknow what approach to use.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI now recall a time when we had a disagreement over something <br/>\nregarding my oldest daughter (don&#39;t even recall the specifics now, <br/>\nsomething to do with homeschooling, but..)and I told her that these <br/>\nwere MY decisions to make and that I was doing what I thought was <br/>\nbest for my daughter and for my family.  Her response was that they <br/>\nare NOT my decisions.  That I&#39;m hurting my children every day.  It <br/>\nwent on and on.  In front of the kids.  It seems like it was only <br/>\ndays after the birth of my last baby, I&#39;m honestly not sure, <br/>\nthough.  She just jumped up and left, slamming the door behind her.  <br/>\nThe kids were all mad at ME because they were supposed to go to her <br/>\nhouse that day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I think about all this, I see where my hesitation comes <br/>\nin.  When I started this thread, I was trying to include everything <br/>\nneeded for background type info but didn&#39;t even remember all this.  <br/>\nI often feel as though I&#39;m stuck in the middle.  Only in the past <br/>\nyear or two has my oldest daughter realized what really goes on <br/>\nbetween us. (Gm and me.)  But the little ones see ME as being the <br/>\nbad guy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe called today and talked to my 6 yr old,  (I was in the shower at <br/>\nthe time) to invite us over for Easter dinner.  Nic told her we were <br/>\ngoing to have fun that day and told her of our plans.  For me, right <br/>\nnow, it is easier to have an alternative to seeing her as an excuse <br/>\nnot to go over.  They just don&#39;t see the problems that are there and <br/>\nI usually end up with the bad rap in the end because of it.  I just <br/>\nhope I come to a place of comfort in this soon, as we are heading <br/>\ninto birthday alley (all the kids birthdays start one after another <br/>\nuntil Sept.)and I dread how we will handle the invitation list to <br/>\nthe parties if I can&#39;t get through to my grandmother before that <br/>\ntime comes.   I could even deal with an agree to disagree type of <br/>\nsituation but slapping my child&#39;s hand is not something I can agree <br/>\nto disagree with.  We shall see....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your comments.  It is wonderful to have other ideas <br/>\nto pour over while dealing with this.  It might not be so bad if I <br/>\nactually thought it would all work out, but my fear is that nothing <br/>\nwill ever change and I will be forced to choose excluding her from <br/>\nour lives for the kids safety and my sanity.  You&#39;d think it would <br/>\nbe a simple matter, but emotionally, for me, it is rocking me to the <br/>\ncore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] daily rituals and unschooling *and* a ps on dealing with family","postDate":"1050468627","msgId":65026,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZiLjNjYzcwY2VkLjJiY2UzYjEzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65024,"nextInTopic":65033,"prevInTime":65025,"nextInTime":65027,"topicId":65017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/15/03 6:52:33 PM, jmcseals@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1210866294\">In a message dated 4/15/03 6:52:33 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmcseals@...\">jmcseals@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I find when we stray from this, <br/>\nif I let them do their own thing and head off to bed whenever, they are all <br/>\nquite fussy and we end up with a lot of fights.

What I&#39;ve seen them do is when babies are asleep other people get <br/>\nquiet.  And they used to have (when they lived near enough for me to know) a <br/>\nmom-and-dad bed (big enough for four or five &lt;g&gt;) and then a full room of <br/>\n&quot;bed&quot;--mattresses all over the place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know they&#39;ve ended up with a bigger house.  That was a three bedroom <br/>\napartment, when they had five kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the paragraph quoted up above it sounds like one thing and maybe it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nwhat you really meant.  It sounds like you&#39;re saying if anyone fails to <br/>\nfollow the routin, everyone will be fussy.  Isn&#39;t it possible to tell the <br/>\nolder ones they can stay up if they can be extra aware to be kind and patient <br/>\nthe next day, and if they&#39;re too cranky they need to get more sleep?  That&#39;s <br/>\nhow we made deals about letting a kid stay up really late when he was little. <br/>\n &quot;Okay, but count back from when you have to get up, and if you are too tired <br/>\ntomorrow, be careful not to take it out on other people.  It wasn&#39;t their <br/>\nfault you stayed up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The one thing I find <br/>\nI must insist on is our daily quiet time.

People can <br/>\nwatch TV if it&#39;s turned down low, or go in and out of the house, but they&#39;re <br/>\nreminded to close the door really quietly.  We try not to tell people to call <br/>\nus in the morning; we call them instead.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an absolute silence, it&#39;s a courtesy.  After noon, if someone&#39;s <br/>\nstill asleep that&#39;s okay, but other don&#39;t have to be as quiet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while we had a &quot;be in bed before 5:00 a.m. and get up before noon.&quot;  I <br/>\nwas doing that because it seemed to really bug my husband if a boy was still <br/>\nup on the computer when he left for work at 5:30 a.m. (and it varies) and if <br/>\nsomeone was asleep when he came home, sometimes at 1:30 or 2:00.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen after about a year or more of that &quot;rule,&quot; Marty said something about it <br/>\nto Keith who said he didn&#39;t really care.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat changed was Keith saw more and more of how much the boys were learning <br/>\nand how well they were getting along.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was gradual, even with all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we only have three kids, and they&#39;re fairly closely grouped.  Less than <br/>\nfive and a half years from #1 to #3.   So my situation&#39;s too easy to compare.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;For us, the situation is working.  I just wonder what it looks like from an <br/>\nunschooling perspective.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a point where too many rules and too much schedule is a <br/>\nhindrance.  When it&#39;s purely arbitrary and the child&#39;s interests and needs <br/>\naren&#39;t considered, I think that&#39;s harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all the luxury stuff about flexibility and food freedom and all that <br/>\nisn&#39;t directly what is or isn&#39;t unschooling.  I think it can be a by-product. <br/>\n With my family, most of that came first (TV freedom, very lax bedtime, food <br/>\nnot regulated, no dessert-training) and that made unschooling a snap.   And <br/>\nsome start with unschooling and pick up some oft he other stuff (or rather <br/>\nlet it fall).  But that&#39;s not what makes or breaks unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100122184,"authorName":"Lisa M. C. Bentley","from":"&quot;Lisa M. C.

My children are 12, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, and 6 months.  I find <br/>\nit difficult to maintain peace and happiness without some sort of daily <br/>\nrhythm.  Our &#39;schedules&#39; are not set in stone, but I came to unschooling <br/>\nfrom a Waldorf perspective and we really enjoy the daily flow of having a <br/>\nguiding rhythm.  I say we because I see that my children benefit from <br/>\nknowing what to expect in general.  Examples would be, mealtimes, nap/quiet <br/>\ntimes, bedtimes, etc.  We don&#39;t so much have a certain time set by the <br/>\nclock, but we do follow an evening ritual of baths, songs, stories, bedtime. <br/>\n  This may start at 6 in the evening or 8 in the evening, but we tend to <br/>\nfollow the same general path every night.  I find when we stray from this, <br/>\nif I let them do their own thing and head off to bed whenever, they are all <br/>\nquite fussy and we end up with a lot of fights.  (Not between the kids and I <br/>\nbut between the kids together.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter (12) is not so much involved in this process, aside from <br/>\nmealtimes, etc.  After three years of listening to me rave about Harry <br/>\nPotter, she stayed up all night and read the entire first book till 4 in the <br/>\nmorning.  (She came to me today and told me she read it but wanted it to be <br/>\na surprise.  She also asked for book 2, lol.) I&#39;ve never said anything more <br/>\nthan how much I loved it but she was over my shoulder this week reading <br/>\nabout the video games you all have been discussing.  Guess that sparked her <br/>\ninterest!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: Is it hindering to have such a daily rhythm?  If so, do you <br/>\nhave any suggestions in curbing the fighting and unhappiness that result <br/>\nwhen no rhythm is involved?  Perhaps, had we not been doing this for so long <br/>\nit might be different, but since we have been doing it for so long, I guess <br/>\nit just seems natural to them.  On the rare occasion that I do hear a <br/>\ncompaint, such as nap/quiet time, I try to offer suggestions for things to <br/>\ndo, play outside (in this case they can be loud), quietly watch tv, play a <br/>\ngame, spend time with me cooking, reading, etc., etc.  The one thing I find <br/>\nI must insist on is our daily quiet time.  If the older kids are loud in the <br/>\nhouse while the boys and the baby nap, they don&#39;t sleep and end up being <br/>\nextremely fussy throughout the rest of the day.  I&#39;m interested particularly <br/>\non any thoughts directly related to this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, the situation is working.  I just wonder what it looks like from an <br/>\nunschooling perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm Wishes,<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.
