Cal, where education is very <br/>\nimportant and most of our schools are Distinguished schools.  My <br/>\nhusband and I moved here to give our children a chance at life <br/>\nthrough this so called great school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time our dd was in 3rd grade she was begging us to homeschool <br/>\nher.  She was completely bored in school and she hated the bullying <br/>\nby the other girls.  Even her teacher told me at her conference that <br/>\nher problem was boredom because she knew all the material he was <br/>\nteaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe brought her home and tried to teach her the best we could.  I <br/>\nread several books, attended seminars and talked with other <br/>\nhomeschoolers.  We must have gone through 8 or 9 different <br/>\ncurriculums over that year or so.  My dd became increasing <br/>\nfrustrated and was beginning to hate not only the school work but <br/>\nshe was withdrawing from me. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut last year through some unfortunate events in our life I had to <br/>\nstopped &quot;schooling&quot;  her.  Then I found a great book &quot;the unschooled <br/>\nhandbook&quot;.  That book changed our life forever.  Since that time I <br/>\nhave read several of Holt&#39;s books, Ren&#39;s book and several others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship with my dd is on the mend, we have grown closer and <br/>\nshe has learned things on her own.  She may not be learning what her <br/>\npeers in PS are, but my little 11 yo dd can design a website with <br/>\ngraphics, has learned to type and is much more self confident today <br/>\nthan a year ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael, my dd doesn&#39;t need someone to tell her what or who to <br/>\nstudy.  She will get what she needs, when she needs it and will find <br/>\nher own way to contribute to society with me and her father at her <br/>\nside cheering her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109688,"nextTopicId":109697}}
