I know you have a lot of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1180191105\">Cathy, I am not an experienced unschooler, but I have been learning a lot<br/>\nand fast since deciding to become one just this last year.  I know you<br/>\nhave a lot of answers to your question about the role of parents in<br/>\nunschooling already, but I want to answer it in terms of you being a<br/>\nChristian.  The Bible says to share your experiences of witnessing God in<br/>\naction in your personal life with other people, including your children. <br/>\nAlso, the Bible says to not cause your children to be discouraged.  I<br/>\nthink that means we should encourage them instead of focusing on their<br/>\nmistakes.  It also says that God wants the hearts of the parents to be<br/>\nturned to their children.  I think that means to really listen to them<br/>\nand know them.  And when the Bible says to raise up a child in the way he<br/>\nshould go, it means according to his god-given natural bent, which is<br/>\nwhat unschooling is all about.  Also, though we have authority over our<br/>\nchildren, the Biblical purpose for authority is to protect and care for<br/>\nothers.  When the Bible talks about a minister managing his family, I<br/>\nused to think it meant he had to have a firm hand on the kids.  But after<br/>\npraying about this, I realized that a father cannot force his children to<br/>\nrespect him.  So now that scripture means to me that he is taking the<br/>\ntime to know his children and to spend time with them, so they respect<br/>\nhim.  And it also says to me that God cares so much about the man&#39;s<br/>\nfamily that it should come first before his public ministry.  To me,<br/>\nChristian unschooling means being real.  It is all about being honest<br/>\nabout who I am with my children and allowing them to be honest with me<br/>\nabout who they are, without fear of wrath.  I have also been learning a<br/>\nlot from sources outside the church, which was scary at first because I<br/>\nwas concerned about ungodly counsel.  But everything I learned<br/>\ncorresponded with my Bible reading.  I found particular help from a book<br/>\ncalled How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and How to Listen So Kids Will<br/>\nTalk.  Jesus said that the gentile rulers lord it over them but that we<br/>\nare God&#39;s children and should lead by serving.  I was raised by an<br/>\nabusive mother who exercised her will over mine by controlling force. <br/>\nNow I am learning about Christlike authority and giving up control and<br/>\nusing respectful techniques to communicate with, not dominate my<br/>\nchildren.  I am having a wonderful journey.  It is hard sometimes to try<br/>\nnew ways, but persevere because it is so worth it!<br/>\nBonni in Oregon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89113005,"authorName":"psam ordener","from":"&quot;psam ordener&quot; &lt;psamo@...&gt;","profile":"pordener","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Role of Parents","postDate":"1013270904","msgId":31971,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMTEwMWMxYjE4NSQwM2E2OTRlMCQzNDQwZTgzZkBwc2Ftbz4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTIwMTk1MjAuMTU1MC43NjUxMy5tNkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwwMDExMDFjMWE2OTgkN2Y0ZDU5YTAkMjhhNmIxZDhAZGVmYXVsdD4gPDAzZGQwMWMxYjE2NSRkNjMzOGI0MCQ3NmNlMDdjNEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":31962,"nextInTopic":31974,"prevInTime":31970,"nextInTime":31972,"topicId":31962,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... roles ... should ...

My child wants to learn about the world; as<br/>\na parent, it&#39;s my job to help him do that.   We don&#39;t have the adversarial<br/>\nrelationship we had when he was in school, and it seemed my job was to force<br/>\nhim to do reams of meaningless homework every night.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re all in this together.  I&#39;m older and have more experience as well as<br/>\nthe legal responsibility for the children, so they have to defer to my<br/>\njudgement in some areas.  They&#39;re young and excited about learning and I<br/>\ndefer to their wishes about their education, finding that all those<br/>\nmysterious &quot;gaps&quot; that educrats worry about fill in over time.  It&#39;s amazing<br/>\nhow little time it takes a child to learn a new subject, when it&#39;s his idea<br/>\nand he&#39;s enthusiastic about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was brought to mind recently, when my 13yo Moose joined a Stock Market<br/>\nGame team.  He did it mostly because a couple of his friends were on the<br/>\nteam and asked; he didn&#39;t really have a lot of interest in the stock<br/>\nmarket - but whoa!  He has taken off with this interest!  Now the first<br/>\nthing he reads after the comics is the business section.  He follows &quot;his<br/>\nstocks&quot; (the ones his team purchased) daily.  He talks with his Dad about<br/>\ninvesting and what he thinks might be good stocks.  He gets on the Internet<br/>\nand looks up stocks and their performance, hunts down bits of information<br/>\nabout companies he thinks might work in their portfolio, and joins<br/>\nenthusiastically in their twice-weekly on-line chats about possible new<br/>\npurchases.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s unschooling at its finest - and he&#39;s learning a lot about economics,<br/>\nabout how world events affect the stock market, about profit-and-loss<br/>\nstatements, different kinds of businesses (corporations, sole<br/>\nproprietorships, limited partnerships).  He&#39;s learning about taxes and why<br/>\ngovernment imposes them and how they are used.  Wow.
