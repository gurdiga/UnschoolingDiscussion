Someone once asked her why she didn&#39;t homeschool <br/>\nher boys.  Her answer was, &quot;Why should I?&quot;  (rhetorical question, she <br/>\nwas not actually looking for an answer.)  We can all sit here and <br/>\nthink of many reasons why she should, but since it worked for her, it <br/>\nseemed to be working for her kids, and it fit her lifestyle, she felt <br/>\nno need to consider doing anything BUT school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Gee, school prevented me from organizing information in a way that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>was <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; logical to me.

(Again, a generalization, no single description is <br/>\ngoing to fit every person of a certain MB type.

But everyone has different levels of <br/>\ntheir preference (hence the &quot;wimpy&quot; vs. &quot;balanced&quot; discussion.)  Some <br/>\nare extreme ST&#39;s and others are more middle of the road.  Maybe it <br/>\nis the extreme ST that this would be mostly refering to?

NTs are best thought of as <br/>\ntinkerers. They catch a vision for a new approach to something <br/>\nand will endlessly fiddle with it to get it to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nNTPs are ever adapting and learning new skills. They love the <br/>\nchallenge of adding to their abilities and are the most <br/>\nunitimidated of all the types when facing something new. They <br/>\nare amazingly good at improvising and adapting and run with a <br/>\nrought draft, eschewing the painstaking tedium of drawing up <br/>\nplans. ENTPs are verbally adept and love word play and <br/>\nconversations. (Typically NTs are college professors or <br/>\nscientists and often hated high school because it was drudgery <br/>\nand not challenging or creative intellectually enough.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNTJs are equally taken with ideas but are more interested in <br/>\nfinding exact systems that work. They like to be in control and to <br/>\nfind ways to achieve the end result that worksvery comfortable <br/>\ndelegating and enrolling people in their pet projects and <br/>\nventures. Don&#39;t BS the NTJ. They must have a system that works <br/>\nand aren&#39;t interested in anything for the sake of tradition or <br/>\ninstitutional regulation. (Notice that theme!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is an endless opportunity to tinker, to plan and <br/>\nexecute, to creatively problem-solve, to learn new skills and <br/>\nideas. And it&#39;s a place where what works is top priority, not what <br/>\nis expected. That appeals to NTs very much. NTs are also <br/>\negalitarian in their approach to others. They aren&#39;t impressed <br/>\nwith credentials and are just as likely to chat intelligently and <br/>\nnon-judgmentally with children (as though they were adults) as <br/>\nthey are to look down on an esteemed adult who is <br/>\nsmall-minded. They have little patience for pecking orders.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I&#39;ve noticed (being an ENFP married to an ENTP) is <br/>\nthat while I approach life from figuring out people and how to <br/>\nenhance relationships, my dh is drawn to ideas and skills that <br/>\nmake life work. Together, we have a really good management <br/>\nteam approach to family life. I focus on drawing out the feelings, <br/>\non nurturing the relationships, on creating an atmostphere of <br/>\nlove and learning while he is ever on the look out for effective <br/>\nmodels of communication, tools to enhance someone&#39;s interest <br/>\nin a specialized area and finding games and activities that bring <br/>\nus together. When we&#39;re clicking, it&#39;s a beautiful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we definitely also have conflicts. These generally come from <br/>\nmy profound attachment to protecting my kids from pain and his <br/>\nneed to see results. I&#39;ve had to learn how to adapt to seeing the <br/>\nworld through his eyes and he&#39;s had to learn to see through my <br/>\nheart. It&#39;s been a good education for both of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he is a part-time college professor, too, which helps with <br/>\nunschooling since he thinks school is a total waste of time.

I&#39;ll share my best guesses and thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNFs tend to be the most empathic of the temperaments. They <br/>\nfocus on the feelings and needs of people primarily (over <br/>\norganizations, institutions and dutiesiow, probably a lot fewer <br/>\nNFs in the military, for instance! LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\nNFs make great therapists, counselors, sales people, actors <br/>\n(ability to recreate other people&#39;s characters and emotions <br/>\naccurately) writers, missionaries, martyrs, teachers, and any of <br/>\nthe helping professions. They feel most right with the world <br/>\nwhen they have understood someone else (and how he/she <br/>\nthinks and feels) and can respond to that person&#39;s inner life.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling focuses on the needs of the individualwe say <br/>\nwho the child is and how he/she interacts with the world is of <br/>\nprimary importance. We are also driven to see congruency <br/>\nbetween what people say they feel/believe and what they do. If an <br/>\nNF watches a child suffer through &quot;school work,&quot; the NF is more <br/>\nlikely to ask &quot;Why is my child suffering? How can I relieve it? <br/>\nWhat is wrong with this situation that it is troubling my child?&quot; An <br/>\nNF doesn&#39;t hold a curricula or method as the supreme good to <br/>\nbe adjusted to. And NFs tend to be people pleasers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow this works in unschooling may be like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nChild A is showing signs of boredom, distress or lethargy in the <br/>\nuse of &quot;X&quot; curricula. An NF mother will be more interested in what <br/>\nthe child is expressing and meeting that need/feeling than she is <br/>\nin fulfilling the &quot;supposed requirement.&quot; That means NFs are <br/>\nquick to switch curricula, to dump expectations, to find <br/>\nalternatives so that child A will feel happier, more at peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause an NF trusts to her own intuition, she&#39;s also less <br/>\nworried about outward manifestations/measurements of her <br/>\nchildren and relies on her ability to perceive. She will &quot;know&quot; that <br/>\nher child is fine, but may not be able to rpove it to someone who <br/>\nis more measurement oriented.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany NFs tend to be frustrated by test-taking, requirements, <br/>\nrules, organizational expectations and schedules. They need to <br/>\nsee meaning in what they do to commit to it. They are driven by <br/>\nthe quest for meaning more than any other drive. Parenting is a <br/>\npowerful vehicle for discovering meaning and therefore, putting a <br/>\nchild&#39;s emotional and mental well-being first is enormously <br/>\nsatisfying for the NF mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nNFs also tend to be excellent parents in terms of their abilities to <br/>\nhear their children, empathize and exhibit genuine caring. They <br/>\nstay truly interested in who their children actually are rather than <br/>\nbeing worried primarily about who they might become. NFs also <br/>\nlove a good cause and will fight against the traditional forces that <br/>\nbe to see to it that their cause is well-represented!<br/>\n<br/>\nI see unschooling as offering an NF a framework for focusing on <br/>\nthe child, meeting her needs at a primary level and giving the NF <br/>\nmother the freedom to chuck obligations that don&#39;t make sense <br/>\nto her. I also see unschooling being a good cause for the NF to <br/>\nstand for and champion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, many NFs are drawn to teaching as a profession. But <br/>\nNFs don&#39;t thrive in the school system. They are there for the <br/>\npeople orientation and generally NFs burn out in the schools <br/>\nand tend to leave or move on more than any other temperament. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t like beauracracy at all and happily buck the system in <br/>\nfavor of people concerns which then gets them in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just some of the things I&#39;ve gleaned from my amateur <br/>\ninvestigation into temperaments (another typical NF hobby. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Bthe cause-loving, people centered ENFP</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84256943,"authorName":"LauraBourdo@aol.com","from":"LauraBourdo@...","profile":"crazeemom77043","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New poll for Unschooling-dotcom","postDate":"1055667870","msgId":74222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2ZS4xZmZiYWIxMy4yYzFkOTA5ZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72696,"nextInTopic":74245,"prevInTime":74221,"nextInTime":74223,"topicId":72567,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 06/11/2003 12:52:05 AM Central Daylight Time, ...
