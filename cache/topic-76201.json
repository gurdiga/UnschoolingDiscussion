That I must always be<br/>\nlonging for a break from those kids. There&#39;s also an implication<br/>\nthere that I am not paying enough attention to HER.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if your son and his girlfriend are coming by every night for<br/>\ndinner, it sounds like you have a great relationship and you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t worry! The GF must feel very welcome! Given that, I&#39;m sure<br/>\nyour son is happy to spend time with you alone. In my case, I feel<br/>\nlike my DH and kids are NOT welcome. You probably have a friendship<br/>\nwith the GF, too. Unfortunately, my DH&#39;s parents are dead. But in<br/>\npast relationships, I &#39;ve had great friendships with boyfriends&#39;<br/>\nmothers. It really meant a lot to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said your MIL doesn&#39;t like your children. Sometimes I get the<br/>\nfeeling my mom doesn&#39;t like MY children!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;�� Date: Fri, 4 Jul 2003 12:50:28 EDT<br/>\n&gt;�� From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: happiness of kids, at parties, w/mom<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 7/4/2003 12:52:59 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naake1999@...\">naake1999@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;She&#39;s the same way with my brother and sister... always acting all <br/>\n&gt;&gt;flattered when we visit without the kids.

I don&#39;t have any grandchildren, yet.� I<br/>\n&gt;do have a son who&#39;s been with the same girl for seven years in a committed<br/>\n&gt;relationship, just not married.� They come almost every night for supper or<br/>\n&gt;dessert.� They almost always go on every family trip or outing with us.� <br/>\n&gt;BUT<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;being said, I LOVE time alone with my son.� I am VERY flattered when he <br/>\n&gt;will<br/>\n&gt;call and invite me to lunch, just him and myself.� I love it when he will <br/>\n&gt;ask me<br/>\n&gt;if I want to go shopping with just him.� I don&#39;t try to orchestrate being<br/>\n&gt;alone with him without Carrisa but it is a TREAT for me.� As much as we <br/>\n&gt;love our<br/>\n&gt;children now, we love them and cherish them equally when they are grown, I <br/>\n&gt;do<br/>\n&gt;anyway.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know my MIL always tells me they are meant to grow up and out and on <br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt;own and see their parents on Sundays for an hour.� If my child chooses to <br/>\n&gt;do<br/>\n&gt;this, well that&#39;s fine but so far that doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s likely to <br/>\n&gt;happen.<br/>\n&gt;Her son, my DH sees her maybe once or twice a year, whenever I think I can<br/>\n&gt;stand it (she doesn&#39;t like our children, I don&#39;t like people who don&#39;t like <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;children).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I will be very cautious about time alone with my children after reading <br/>\n&gt;your<br/>\n&gt;post.� It never occurred to me that a child would find it offensive to <br/>\n&gt;spend<br/>\n&gt;alone time with their parent.� I can see that if she never wants to welcome<br/>\n&gt;your children or spouse into the mix it could be a serious problem, much <br/>\n&gt;like<br/>\n&gt;with my MIL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you for making me think about something I&#39;ve never considered in my<br/>\n&gt;family dynamics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;glena<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
