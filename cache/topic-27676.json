Yeah, I think too many people<br/>\nrestrict their children&#39;s TV unnecessarily.  I also think there are kids<br/>\nand ocassion for which a little restriction is called for.  The problems<br/>\ncome when you try to make blanket statments about what EVERYBODY should<br/>\nbe doing.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been blasted here for restricting my son&#39;s TV watching when it was<br/>\nactually doing harm.  Yet, I hear it from other sources that I watch too<br/>\nmuch TV and I let my kids watch too much TV.  I guess I should take<br/>\nsolace in that adage about &quot;if you are pissing off both sides, you must<br/>\nbe getting something right.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pam, who should also just come right out of the closet and admit to <br/>\n&gt; liking romance novels.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>EEEWWWWW . . .
