But I do think<br/>\nthey should be well-treated, in general, to avoid having them damaged or<br/>\ndestroyed. Rain has learned this by mostly through watching how I treat<br/>\nthings, and by having things of her own that she enjoys having, and<br/>\ncaring for. She&#39;s as responsible as she wants to be, and she generally<br/>\ntakes the responsibility as she&#39;s ready for it. Right now, at 9, she does<br/>\nan occasionally load of laundry but generally I do it. I&#39;m responsible<br/>\nfor laundry.  OTOH, she does almost all of the upkeep on her room - it&#39;s<br/>\na tiny room, admittedly, maybe 8x9, but she didn&#39;t have her own room for<br/>\nyears and she really enjoys having this one, and fixing it up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat, to me, is how unschooling works - kids do things as they&#39;re ready.<br/>\nIMO, if you create power struggles and try to make them do things sooner,<br/>\nyou shoot yourself in the foot and it often takes years longer, or maybe<br/>\nthey never really master doing it on their own because whenever they do<br/>\nthey feel like they&#39;re &quot;losing&quot; the struggle by doing what you coerced<br/>\nthem into doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust for the record, we&#39;re not especially neat, actually we&#39;re somewhere<br/>\nbetween lived-in and downright messy, most days... but it works for us,.<br/>\n<br/>\ndar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":27496206,"authorName":"Amy Thomlinson","from":"Amy Thomlinson &lt;diamond_h2o@...&gt;","profile":"diamond_h2o","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling after homeschooling ANDcleaning rooms","postDate":"1024619850","msgId":38479,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNjIxMDAzNzMwLjc0ODQ3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0Mi4xMDQ5YjNhNi4yYTQzOWZlNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38471,"nextInTopic":38487,"prevInTime":38478,"nextInTime":38480,"topicId":38444,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Since I am not a stay at home mom  does that make it all right for my house to have different rules.

Obviously, as you said later in this email (which I<br/>\nsnipped), it can happen (that socks don&#39;t get washed).  What<br/>\nI am taking issue with is the idea that if children are<br/>\nallowed to experience &quot;natural&quot; consequences, they will<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it is my role as a parent, to help my children not<br/>\nexperience negative consequences if I can help it.  Sure,<br/>\nyou can&#39;t prevent them all but I would not stand by and<br/>\nwatch that bad thing happen for the sake of a lesson.  Of<br/>\ncourse, running out of socks is not the end of the world,<br/>\nLOL.  But I am making a point about what some people call<br/>\nnatural consequences being used as a learning tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another example.  You stay up late, you will miss the<br/>\nbus and be late for school.  (An example that won&#39;t step on<br/>\nany toes in this group perhaps!)  It sounds logical enough<br/>\nbut it just isn&#39;t true that if you stay up late you will<br/>\nnecessarily be late for school.  Maybe you set out clothes<br/>\nand stuff the night before so it takes less time in the<br/>\nmorning.  Maybe you hand the kid a sandwich on their way out<br/>\nthe door instead of the usual sit down breakfast.  Maybe you<br/>\ngive the kid a ride to school so the missed bus isn&#39;t an<br/>\nissue, skip school that day (hee hee) etc. etc. etc.  Many<br/>\nways to solve the problem so that the supposed natural<br/>\nconsequence doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see no reason to withhold privileges from them in addition<br/>\nto being the washerwoman.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo argument from me here :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDebra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling after homeschooling ANDcleaning rooms","postDate":"1024608701","msgId":38471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Zi45N2FiN2RlLjJhNDNhM2JkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38469,"nextInTopic":38479,"prevInTime":38470,"nextInTime":38472,"topicId":38444,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/20/02 4:16:13 PM Central Daylight Time, ...

That is why I don&#39;t <br/>\nseparate everyone&#39;s laundry, no one does *just their* laundry. Someone will <br/>\nput a load of whites in, someone else will separate the clothes in the dryer <br/>\ninto everyone&#39;s respected baskets. I do the laundry and cook and clean and I <br/>\ndo it joyfully. I want to do these things. My kids and husband see this and <br/>\nthey want to help out as well. I suppose if I grumbled and gritched as I did <br/>\nthese things and made my kids do their laundry, then everyone would think it <br/>\nwas a pain in the butt to do household chores. As it stands now Moly enjoys <br/>\npicking out a recipe, writing down a list of groceries, shopping, paying, <br/>\nputting the things away and cooking it all up. Jack loves to do the dryer. He <br/>\nloves the warm clothes, they way they smell, how soft they are as he puts <br/>\nthem into the basket they belong in, and he absolutely loves cleaning out the <br/>\nlint trap! (I don&#39;t know why, but he does) Moly gets a kick out of vacuuming. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think I am taking advantage of my kids time, if they wanted to do <br/>\nsomething else I wouldn&#39;t care. Besides we have all found that it takes much <br/>\nless of our time if we all pitch in for a few minutes a day, doing a little <br/>\nbit at a time than the time it takes if we let things pile up and have to <br/>\ntackle the mess all at once.<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling after homeschooling ANDcleaning rooms","postDate":"1024607717","msgId":38469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Mi4xMDQ5YjNhNi4yYTQzOWZlNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38466,"nextInTopic":38471,"prevInTime":38468,"nextInTime":38470,"topicId":38444,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/20/02 1:55:17 PM, leschke@islandnet.com writes:  No, but there should be a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-636042598\">In a message dated 6/20/02 1:55:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Nobody comes around and reminds me to do *my* laundry.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, but there should be a difference between the responsibilities of adults <br/>\nand stay-at-home moms, and the responsibilities of full-time-employed other <br/>\nadults, and kids, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband doesn&#39;t dress up a lot to go to work, but if I notice the laundry <br/>\npile in our bedroom getting up there, I will at least grab some of the shirts <br/>\nand underwear so he can wear his most comfortable favorites.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the more I do for my family, the more they&#39;re willing to do for <br/>\nme.
