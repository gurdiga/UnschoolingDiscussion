First, the conference was great, <br/>\nand I want to thank everyone who chatted with my shy boy. It&#39;s hard to tell <br/>\nJulian is shy sometimes. He is easy to engage in conversation (especially for <br/>\nadults), he comfortably gets up in front of people and sings...but it&#39;s hard for <br/>\nhim to initiate conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left on Monday and headed to Williamsburg, Virginia. We had a day at <br/>\nColonial Williamsburg, then a day at Busch Gardens. Both were a lot of fun. We had <br/>\nmany hours in the car, listening to story tapes. We talked a lot. Then we <br/>\nspent evenings watching trashy tv in hotels, cuddled together. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice to be back, especially since Beth surprised us with cleaned and <br/>\norganized rooms. Both my office and the Library (which is kind of Julian&#39;s <br/>\noffice) were all fixed up.  (We moved into this house two years ago, and both rooms <br/>\nhave looked pretty awful for a LONG time!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for a great experience.  Thank you, especially, Kelly...you did <br/>\na fabulous job. And remind Ben that I thought he was great. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79435,"nextTopicId":79428}}
