If you are an unschooling family and have used this school online and would like to share your experience I would greatly appreciate it. I am very curious to know how the assessment of lower grade students takes place. I couldn&#39;t get any information on their website. Do they have tests, worksheet submission online, etc?<br/>\nThank You<br/>\nRimma and Harrison (almost 5) in NYC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113562,"nextTopicId":33813}}
