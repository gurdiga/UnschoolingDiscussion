When they were little he and the mom and other kids had been in <br/>\nIndia while the dad was in Toronto studying physics.    He said the babies <br/>\ndidn&#39;t wear diapers, just little kurtas, the long white shirts.   In India <br/>\nthey have floor-hole toilets, and he said the mom taught the little guys to <br/>\npoop by squatting or sitting and making a little potty-seat with her feet, <br/>\nlike heels together, feet arched, toes together, outsides of feet toward the <br/>\nfloor, and setting the baby on her feet and the baby would poop and then <br/>\nshe&#39;d flush it (if it was in the toilet) or just clean it up (if it had been <br/>\non the ground, or on paper or whatever--that I wasn&#39;t clear on).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was just noting that the little potty-chairs Americans use are not <br/>\nefficient for helping babies poop because squatting is the way anyway, knees <br/>\nup, butt down.  He was pre-med and ended up going off elsewhere and becoming <br/>\na doctor, and he was interested in some of the dumb things Americans thought <br/>\nwere good and right, like chair-style toilets.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still remember the first time I passed by and saw him squatted up on the <br/>\ntoilet seat, reading a magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even now, sometimes if I&#39;m having a difficult time pooping I squat and it <br/>\nreally does  help.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis clever friend said we would have WAY fewer health problems if we didn&#39;t <br/>\nstrain ourselves to try to push poop out with muscles which weren&#39;t intended <br/>\nfor that, and if we&#39;d use the natural position all would be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23340,"nextTopicId":23344}}
