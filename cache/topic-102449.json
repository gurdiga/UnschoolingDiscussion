I&#39;ve heard that when you <br/>\nread off of what  you percieve as colored paper, it goes to a <br/>\ndifferent part of your brain,  and that&#39;s why it works for some <br/>\npeople. Reading upside down can sometimes  help too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------<br/>\n <br/>\nSo...<br/>\nCan&#39;t unschoolers just use REAL colored paper then, and real colored  pens?<br/>\n <br/>\nI take notes in more than one color, often. I almost always have three or  <br/>\nfour felt-tip pens of different colors in my pocket or if I have a backpack I  <br/>\nmight have eight or ten.<br/>\n <br/>\nTricks for helping dyslexic kids keep up in school are not, I don&#39;t think,  <br/>\nnecessary for unschoolers.   But maybe I&#39;m missing the point and maybe  I even <br/>\nmissed a post.  I should go and look at the groups page.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe different part of brain reminded me of something, though.  When I  <br/>\nmeasure for cooking and I have to count, I count down backwards.  Otherwise  I lose <br/>\ncount.  Even counting to three or four, I can lose count.   Backwards, I never <br/>\ndo.  So like with flour, if I grab up a half cup measure  and need three cups <br/>\nof flour, I count down from six.<br/>\n <br/>\nI transferred that to dealing cards.  Rather than count up from one  and <br/>\ninvariably have to count to see where I am, I count down and never ever lose  <br/>\ntrack.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102308,"nextTopicId":102454}}
