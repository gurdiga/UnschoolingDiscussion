I really should have said &quot;in formal settings&quot;   You stated too <br/>\nthat formal situations that involve rank are less common.  I do agree that rank <br/>\nplays a part in our every day lives.  It is very subtle and most folks do not <br/>\neven realize that is it playing out.   Sandra&#39;s example is perfect of  how <br/>\nrank insticntively works in well adapted individuals.   <br/>\n<br/>\n I don&#39;t think most folks correlate these types of common, every day <br/>\noccurences with  the term &quot;rank&quot;, but, when it comes right down to the basics of it, <br/>\nwhat other term can be used?   Respect? Courtesy? Common sense?  OK.. but WHY <br/>\npractice any of those in this situation?  Because the older, supervising <br/>\nemployee had rank among the young men.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"everyday example (was Re: Manners, rank)","postDate":"1055977560","msgId":74804,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkOS5jMGQyODQzLjJjMjI0YTU4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":74810,"prevInTime":74803,"nextInTime":74805,"topicId":74804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone said considerations of rank don t come up much in everyday life.
