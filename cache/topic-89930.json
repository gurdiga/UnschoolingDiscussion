We live in VA and <br/>\nour daughter went to college in NC.  Our youngest son is looking into attending <br/>\nWVA and he will NOT be getting scholarships so is looking into becoming <br/>\nindependent for his FASA form for next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, you can fill out the FASA form online for free and have it sent to all <br/>\nthe colleges that you choose.  Do it early, as they tend to run out of funds the <br/>\ncloser it gets to the term you&#39;ve applied for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, while State schools may seem a bargain compared to the cost of tuition <br/>\nat private schools, don&#39;t rule them out.  We paid less for a 26,000.00 per <br/>\nyear private college than we would have paid if our daughter had gone to a State <br/>\nschool here in VA.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89929,"nextTopicId":89442}}
