If there are <br/>\npeople in their lives who keep asking questions, seem ignorant about what <br/>\nunschooling, relaxed schooling or homeschooling, she can supply them with <br/>\nsome materials to read, a list of what she&#39;s learning, a portfolio or <br/>\nscrapbook of some of the things she&#39;s done and any other information that <br/>\nmight satisfy their curiosities and answer some of their questions.  If your <br/>\ndaughter seems to be upset about all of the questions and feels they are only <br/>\nasked in a sarcastic, mean, and hurtful way, maybe you can talk to whomever <br/>\nis interrogating her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the term &quot;Unschooling&quot; is a word that adults interpret as kids not <br/>\nhaving to learn.  They just do what they want, which would never include <br/>\nreading, learning measurements by building a birdhouse, learn the parts of a <br/>\nflower by planting flowers and observing their parts, learn geography by <br/>\nstudying the migration of different birds, etc.  The idea that kids can learn <br/>\nwithout someone dictating to them what they have to learn is too hard for <br/>\nmost people to digest.  They can&#39;t seem to get past the idea that if someone <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them, how will they learn?  They don&#39;t seem to realize that <br/>\ntheir children can be just like your daughter, ie. full of curiosities, lots <br/>\nof motivation to learn, and be independent about their learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may want to ask someone who is more experienced with unschooling older <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132256168,"authorName":"HappyMato2@aol.com","from":"HappyMato2@...","profile":"home_ed4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Was: Interrogated by a teacher Is: Interrogated by h...","postDate":"1042918713","msgId":55547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEuMmI4YmUyY2UuMmI1YjA3MzlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55549,"prevInTime":55546,"nextInTime":55548,"topicId":55547,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/18/03 9:11:11 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...

I made <br/>\n&gt; certain that when she shared with her friends that she be careful <br/>\n&gt; not to say, &quot;We don&#39;t have to do school any more.&quot; However, no <br/>\n&gt; matter how it gets explained, I&#39;m finding out that kids hear &quot;They <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t do school any more.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> My children are not of school age or a teenager so I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d <br/>\nhandle it or how they&#39;d handle it.  I remember recently when My children and <br/>\nI were at a neighbor&#39;s house and they had family over.  I was talking with a <br/>\nfew ladies at the table and they asked me if my daughter was in pre-school.  <br/>\nI said no, she&#39;s learning at home.  During our discussion my daughter and a <br/>\nlittle boy, who was almost 5, were laughing and playing at the table.  The <br/>\nfather of the little boy came over and started drilling my daughter.  He <br/>\nstarted asking her questions.  My daughter just stared at him and never <br/>\nanswered any of his questions.  His son answered all of the questions.  At <br/>\nfirst I didn&#39;t understand why he was asking so many questions and then I <br/>\nrealized he must have been listening to the conversation about my daughter <br/>\nnot going to preschool and his son going to preschool.  He left the table <br/>\nwith a proud smile on his face.  He was proud that his son could regurgitate <br/>\nfacts on command, but my daughter couldn&#39;t answer any of his questions.  My <br/>\ndaughter didn&#39;t seem to care and nor did I.  I knew my daughter knew the <br/>\nanswers, but didn&#39;t want to answer them.  It did give me an insight as to <br/>\nwhat might happen to her as she gets older.  Adults will be questioning her <br/>\nand finding out what she&#39;s learning.  At this point, it doesn&#39;t bother me, <br/>\nbut it might when she gets older, and if she feels hurt or belittled from the <br/>\nquestions.  I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do then.  Knowing me, I&#39;ll inform them and <br/>\ngive them more information than what they&#39;ll need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis impressed them, but the skepticism didn&#39;t go away that <br/>\neasily. They all decided that my daughter is an exceptionally <br/>\nmotivated, unique &quot;good&quot; girl. (This is what I&#39;ve always <br/>\nheard--&quot;Your kids are really neat. My kids aren&#39;t like yours. They <br/>\ndon&#39;t have interests. They would veg out all day in front of the TV <br/>\nso I have to require things of them...&quot;) We&#39;ve always appeared to <br/>\nbe very unstructured compared to everyone we know. And my <br/>\nkids have always had a lot of diverse interests that they pursue <br/>\non their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat parents don&#39;t realize is how quickly kids can become interested and <br/>\nmotivated on their own if they only had the opportunity.  I believe TV and <br/>\nother things are a way for kids (and adults) to get a way from the real <br/>\nworld, which isn&#39;t very fun, and to veg out in fantasy land.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55550,"nextTopicId":55553}}
