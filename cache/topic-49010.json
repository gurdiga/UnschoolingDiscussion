Where are <br/>\nyou?  I would love to meet another unschooler. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answer to your question, the law requires standardized testing in <br/>\ngrades 3, 5, and 8.  No way to get around that IF your child is in <br/>\ngrades 3, 5, and 8.  The IF is the loophole. ;)  Nowhere does the law <br/>\nstate that your child has to be in grades 3,5, or 8.  Nowhere does <br/>\nthe law say that you have to report your child&#39;s grade level to the <br/>\nschool district.  Just the age.  So you can use a &quot;K-8 ungraded <br/>\ncurriculum&quot;, never have your child in grades 3, 5, and 8 and never <br/>\nhave them tested.  You don&#39;t have to use the school district&#39;s <br/>\naffidavit.  You can use your own, using the law as your guide or you <br/>\ncan download an affidavit from www.phen.org.  If the school asks you <br/>\nfor a grade level, politely tell them that you aren&#39;t required by law <br/>\nto give them that information.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that you will get away with it.  It depends on your <br/>\ndistrict.  I have a friend who tried it and the school automatically <br/>\nlabeled her 8 year old as a third grader, just because of age.  <br/>\nWhether or not you eventually give in to a pita school district <br/>\ndepends on your comfort level with being fined with truancy and <br/>\ntaking the case to court.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd call your representative and senator and ask them to support <br/>\nHB2560 so we don&#39;t have to go through this nonsense next year!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get good info on complying with the law on the pa-hs list.  <br/>\nTo subscribe to the Penn Homeschooler send an email message TO:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hub@...\">hub@...</a> <br/>\nLeave the subject blank but in the text body type exactly:  subscribe <br/>\npa-hs <br/>\n<br/>\nThis site will tell you everything you need to know about achievement <br/>\ntesting in PA. <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to ask me any other questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., JAnn1027@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pennsylvania requires standardized testing every other year as a <br/>\ncondition of <br/>\n&gt; being allowed to homeschool.
