We occasionally hear coyotes and have seen one mountain lion.<br/>\n&gt; The dogs ran off some havelinas that were eating our pecans one day.   And<br/>\n&gt; since the dogs haven&#39;t figured out how to eat the armadillos, they try to<br/>\n&gt; bark them to death.  Plus the usual animals --a cat, 2 dogs, a bunny, and<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; few hens.
