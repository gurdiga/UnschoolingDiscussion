Born in 1915, on a farm in South <br/>\nDakota, she later married Raymond Moore and spent many years working <br/>\nto establish and upgrade educational programs in post-war Japan. A <br/>\nSeventh-day Adventist, she worked to establish Adventist school <br/>\nsystems in Japan and Okinawa.<br/>\n       After years of service in education and ministry, Dorothy, <br/>\nbeginning in 1983, helped to establish the Moore Academy. Through the <br/>\nAcademy, she helped hundreds of families find resources and create <br/>\npersonalized studies so they could successfully homeschool their <br/>\nchildren. She helped co-author one of the earliest, and best, books <br/>\non homeschooling, Better Late Than Early: A New Approach to Your <br/>\nChild&#39;s Education.<br/>\n       Dorothy&#39;s loving presence will be missed in the homeschooling <br/>\ncommunity.

Dan writes: <br/>\n&quot;Quaqua was formed as part of a pro-bono project to provide <br/>\nscholarships to outstanding home-educated graduates of diverse <br/>\nbackgrounds who are headed to college or some other institution of <br/>\nadvanced learning, as an attempt to give back to home education what <br/>\nhome education has given to me. Quaqua is a non-profit, <br/>\nnon-denominational charity that exacts no membership fees, has no <br/>\npaid staff, and does not promote or sell any particular curriculum, <br/>\nmerchandise or pedagogy.&quot;<br/>\n       The Quaqua website illustrates Dan&#39;s commitment to excellence. <br/>\nDan wrote: &quot;Quaqua is carefully structured to involve different <br/>\nsegments of the home-education community and to address their unique <br/>\nneeds to the greatest degree possible. We cooperate with existing <br/>\nhome-education organizations, publications, events, students, <br/>\nfamilies, and communities to render our service. Award events are <br/>\ndesigned to rotate and occur at conventions around the country <br/>\nsponsored by different interest groups of diverse backgrounds.&quot;<br/>\n       Dan requested that we &quot;caution people that we are still trying <br/>\nto recruit and finalize preparations, and as a result we would <br/>\nappreciate people leaving the lines of communication open at this <br/>\njuncture for those (people or companies or organizations) who 1) wish <br/>\nto volunteer or know of other exceptional potential volunteers <br/>\n(particularly accountants, tax attorneys, financial investment <br/>\nmanagers, computer experts, others who can help Quaqua manage <br/>\nscholarship funds, address IRS filings each year, maintain computer <br/>\noperations in the most professional manner possible; or volunteers <br/>\nwho fill the tougher-to-fill niches in the Selection Committee <br/>\ndiversity requirement of the By-Laws; or people who can help expand <br/>\nthe acceptance and reach of Quaqua to new audiences), 2) wish to <br/>\nraise funds or donate to the scholarship fund (I submitted the <br/>\ntax-exempt application to the IRS, and donations now will be <br/>\nretroactively covered); or 3) are from the media or other <br/>\norganizations.  The web site is fairly thorough, but once I get <br/>\nthings fully up and running I will be happy to field questions from <br/>\npeople who wish to apply for scholarships next year.&quot;<br/>\n       For information visit the Quaqua Society website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quaqua.org\">http://www.quaqua.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~<br/>\n<br/>\n2002 Homeschooling Conferences<br/>\n<br/>\nWisconsin: May 3-4, Wiscsonin Parents Association<br/>\n608-283-3131; <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschooling-wpa.org\">http://www.homeschooling-wpa.org</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschooling-wpa.org\">http://www.homeschooling-wpa.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nConnecticut: May 11, The Connecticut Homeschool Network<br/>\nFor information email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CtHmschlNtwk@...\">CtHmschlNtwk@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUtah: June 8, Utah Homeschool Education Association<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.utah-uhea.org\">http://www.utah-uhea.org</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.utah-uhea.org\">http://www.utah-uhea.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWashington: June 14-15, Washington Homeschool Organization<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.WashHomeschool.org\">http://www.WashHomeschool.org</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.WashHomeschool.org\">http://www.WashHomeschool.org</a><br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WHOoffice@...\">WHOoffice@...</a>; (425) 251-0439<br/>\n<br/>\nPuerto Rico: June 23, Homeschooling Fair<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/tchers2001\">http://www.geocities.com/tchers2001</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/tchers2001\">http://www.geocities.com/tchers2001</a> <br/>\nor 787-255-6571<br/>\n<br/>\nMassachussetts - July 19, 20: Homeschool & Family Learning Conference<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeeducator.com/conferences.htm\">http://www.homeeducator.com/conferences.htm</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeeducator.com/conferences.htm\">http://www.homeeducator.com/conferences.htm</a><br/>\n207-657-2800; email: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:royala@...\">royala@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWashington: August 2-3, Washington Homeschool Organization<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.WashHomeschool.org\">http://www.WashHomeschool.org</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.WashHomeschool.org\">http://www.WashHomeschool.org</a><br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WHOoffice@...\">WHOoffice@...</a>; (425) 251-0439<br/>\n<br/>\nCalifornia: August 16-18: HomeSchool Association of California<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hsc.org\">http://www.hsc.org</a>&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hsc.org\">http://www.hsc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTexas - Oct. 4 and 5: Texas Family Learning Conference<br/>\n(713)695-8109 or email <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:furgfam@...\">furgfam@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~:~<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling.com<br/>\n<br/>\n       The monthly Unschooling.com email newsletter offers information <br/>\nand resources from the Unschooling.com website and the <br/>\nUnschooling-dotcom discussion list.
