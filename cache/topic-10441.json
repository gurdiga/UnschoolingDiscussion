Some of you know me \npersonally, some via email lists, etc., and some of you I&#39;ve never met. However, \nmy plea is the same for all of you. As some of you may know, I am on an email \nlist for Unitarian Universalist homeschoolers. Although I&#39;ve never met most of \nthe people on this list personally, I feel like I know them all very well. One \nof the woman on the list with me has just suffered a terrible loss and needs the \nlove and support of many people. This woman recently (fri. 6/30) gave birth to a \nbeautiful baby boy. However due to shoulder dystoica the baby&#39;s cord got pinned \nbetween his shoulder and&nbsp; the mother&#39;s pelvic bone, cutting off all supply \nto him. He was born not breathing and was taken to the neonatal intensive care \nunit at a local hospital. A brain scan showed now brain function at all. After \ndeliberating with doctors during the day on Friday it was decided that the baby \nshould be removed from life support. This was to happen on Sat. Another person \non the list alerted us to an organization called Lily&#39;s bears that purchases \nbears for families leaving the hospital with empty cradles and broken hearts. \nPlease give any monetary donation you feel is possible at this time. All \nremaining funds will be used for sibling scholarships, etc. Even $1.00 can help. \nThank you all, in advance for your concideration to this matter.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Please send all donations to :</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Terry Stafford</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Box 438</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Fort Langley</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">BC v1m2r7</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10427,"nextTopicId":10448}}
