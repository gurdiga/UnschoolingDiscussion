I<br/>\ndecided I need a hobby. I need to use my brain for something other than<br/>\n&quot;mommy mommy mommy&quot; all day long. Unfortunately, I need somthing I can<br/>\ndo with a very demanding, attention hungry, cute 17 m/o around! So I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen &quot;studying&quot;. Whatever gets my interest. For no particular reason, in<br/>\nno particular order. I&#39;ve always loved astronomy but never really<br/>\nstudied it. At first I thought &quot;what are you going to do with this<br/>\ninfo?&quot;. But then I realized the answer to that was &quot;enjoy it!&quot;. I&#39;m<br/>\nhaving fun! We say part of unschooling is to have hobbies and interests<br/>\nand passions that your kids can see you enjoying. I hope Bridget learns<br/>\nto love astronomy too so we can share this! If not, oh well. *I* love it<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, light pollution is pretty high where I am in Union<br/>\nCounty, NJ. Ah well. I can make out Orion on a good night. But you can<br/>\nalso see the red glow from the nearby city. There is a local reservation<br/>\nnearby where it&#39;s much better. I remember in the 80&#39;s going there to see<br/>\na commet (I have no memory of which one it was). So if we want to watch<br/>\nthe stars, we have to get in the car and take a short drive (less than<br/>\n10 minutes) to do so. Standing in the yard only works on a very clear<br/>\nnight, and even then, we&#39;re missing so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I love the moon! Even w/light pollution you can still make out the<br/>\nfeatures :-) Maybe not if you are in an actual city, I guess (we&#39;re in<br/>\nthe suburbs). <br/>\n<br/>\nJill &quot;keep looking up&quot;. Do you remember the name of that show? Where he<br/>\nused to say that at the end every time? I used to love it! I wonder if<br/>\nit&#39;s still on? (or maybe I&#39;m mis-remembering the quote?).<br/>\n<br/>\nShannonCC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7552,"nextTopicId":7421}}
