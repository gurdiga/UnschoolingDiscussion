As for teenagers,  I can only imagine the agree to disagree<br/>\nsituations! LOL    I think,  that if boundaries are set and are used more<br/>\nlike guidelines (as I think lovemary said),  then you still,  as parent,<br/>\nhave more power to set them.  Howevr,  using information and listening to<br/>\nyour children repsectfully would underlie your boundary setting.  An example<br/>\nfrom another list cropped up recently......about a teen that liked to wander<br/>\noutdoors alone at night.  It is reasonable to inform the child about<br/>\nrestricting or eliminating that due to safety concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is this - my 12 yo dd would eat sweets all day if she could.  I was the<br/>\none in charge of how many sweets she ate and she said she felt like I never<br/>\nlet her eat any.  I could not believe this because it seemed to me that she<br/>\nstill ate way to many so I asked her how many desserts a day she thought<br/>\nwould be reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand your concerns in this area,  my oldest (now 10yo)....well,<br/>\nall my youngsters seem to have a sweet tooth.  I mostly try to work on this<br/>\nby example.  And I think it&#39;s important to share information about how<br/>\nsugar/any refined carbohydrate is digested.....what it does in your body,<br/>\nespecially how it can cause a spike followed by a sharp drop in blood sugar<br/>\n(which in turn gives afalse sensation of hunger).  Beyond trying to help<br/>\nthem be aware of the effects of suger on thier body and explaining....I&#39;d<br/>\nlet them be in food choices.  And offer lots of choices.<br/>\n    This is a real struggle for me, too.  I sometimes want to insist on<br/>\neating breakfast,  but find if I keep my mouth shut and have a nice<br/>\nnutritious breakfast prepared,   that goes much further than anything I<br/>\n*say*.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":44430539,"authorName":"RValvo7626@aol.com","from":"RValvo7626@...","profile":"rvalvo7626","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1717","postDate":"1009822804","msgId":30491,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmLjExN2UxY2YxLjI5NjIwNjU0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30495,"prevInTime":30490,"nextInTime":30492,"topicId":30491,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/30/01 9:03:30 PM Mountain Standard Time, ...
