Those apologies so often heard <br/>\nin school counselors&#39; offices:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry you made me mad.<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry you got mad.<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t wait until later. <br/>\n     [implication:  I wish I had waited until nobody was looking to hit you]<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry we got in a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kid is clearly in the wrong, those above are insulting to the victim.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even REAL apologies of a decent sort can be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider these:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry I hit you.<br/>\nI should have thought of a better thing to do or say.<br/>\nI shouldn&#39;t have called for help, I should have figured out how to handle it <br/>\non my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kid is NOT so clearly in the wrong (or was clearly justified in his <br/>\nanger) then it&#39;s humiliting for the kid who is made to apologize.  He&#39;s being <br/>\nblamed for an incident he didn&#39;t initiate, and blamed for his <br/>\nbest-at-the-moment response.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It takes two&quot; is usually said by the parent of the offender.  It&#39;s lame <br/>\ndefense of lack of social skills, or of bullying.<br/>\n<br/>\nForcing things like these would be kinda like forcing someone who had just <br/>\nprevented her own date rape to apologize to the boy/man for having slapped <br/>\nhim, or screamed, or messing up his car on the way out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some kids who are Eddie Haskell kids (good reference for those old <br/>\nenough for Leave it to Beaver, and I don&#39;t have an example for those <br/>\nyounger).  To the appearance from the parental angle, they are great.  When <br/>\nno parent is looking they are quietly horrible to younger kids.  When the <br/>\nadults show up, they&#39;re the best kid in the room--personable, cooperative...  <br/>\n and they know from experience that if one of the little kids screams or <br/>\nretaliates that the parents will be horrified that their child was rude to so <br/>\npolite a guest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo each situation is different.  Coaching your own kid is great.  Setting a <br/>\nboundary for other people&#39;s kids that you don&#39;t want them to cross is okay <br/>\ntoo, though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly just left without saying goodbye when she was visiting the <br/>\nneighbors.  The little girl&#39;s uncle (her primary caregiver) was becoming <br/>\nfrustrated and irritable, and verbally abusive, and bullying, and <br/>\ninsensitive.  Not bad, maybe, for a childless younger man who really does put <br/>\na LOT of time toward his more-irresponsible brother&#39;s child (mother is <br/>\nsomewhere else entirely; perhaps incarcerated?  because it&#39;s not discussed at <br/>\nall).  But Holly&#39;s not used to it and didn&#39;t want to be part of it or even <br/>\nwitness his behavior toward the other little girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the third time over the years that Holly has had a bad incident at <br/>\nthat house.  Not physically abusive, but stuff that to her seems insane.   <br/>\n(To me, having grown up in the old traditional American way, it&#39;s just par <br/>\nfor the average course.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t dream of making her apologize for turning and going home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about it a lot.  I told her it would have been totally fine for her <br/>\nto say &quot;She doesn&#39;t understand.  Say it a different way.&quot;  Or &quot;She has <br/>\nsunscreen in her eye, so she really needs a towel right now.&quot;  or &quot;You <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t talk to her that way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her she didn&#39;t HAVE to stand up to adults she thought were being <br/>\nawful, but if she did it might help, and if they got angry that her dad and I <br/>\nwould totally defend her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe neighbor will eventually be over to apologize.  I expect his apology will <br/>\nbe something like &quot;I&#39;m sorry Holly got scared the other day&quot; instead of &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nsorry I was hung over and abusive.&quot;  Or he&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;m sorry Briann did <br/>\nsomething the other day to make Holly leave.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then it will be my turn to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38766,"nextTopicId":38724}}
