She was under *so <br/>\nmuch* more control when she was a child, and she bucked that to a <br/>\nhuge extent in raising us. We&#39;re just continuing the trend. But it&#39;s <br/>\nso hard for people to let go of. It&#39;s just something we all have to <br/>\ndeal with, in small and very large global ways.

As Joyce so eloquently writes, a family where ideas and <br/>\nopinions are openly expressed and discussed and have always been openly <br/>\ndiscussed and expressed and encouraged is a very different environment <br/>\nthan most of us experienced with the authority figures in our lives. <br/>\nWhen change comes, and it comes to all eventually, if the habits of a <br/>\nlifetime have been control instead of communication, then family life <br/>\ncan become a mine field of miscommunication and hurt feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the eighties we had trickle-down economics - Reagan told everyone <br/>\nthat what was good for the top 4% of the country, the ones who control <br/>\nmost of the wealth, would trickle down and bring good things to those <br/>\nbelow. It didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents use the same kind of logic and will tell even their grown <br/>\nchildren, who are protesting, that what is good for the parent *is* good <br/>\nfor the child. And if the grown child protests, well, then there&#39;s a <br/>\nwhole new generation of grandchildren to feel powerful over.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]was hair, now mothers","postDate":"1044497962","msgId":57998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMjA2MDIxOTIyLjM5NTAwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyMzU1LTNFNDFBRERELTEyNEBzdG9yZWZ1bGwtMjM1Ny5wdWJsaWMubGF3c29uLndlYnR2Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":57996,"nextInTopic":58019,"prevInTime":57997,"nextInTime":57999,"topicId":57996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Anyone else have someone like this??** Sharon, My mom is very similar,  she is taking my unschooling choices personally.
