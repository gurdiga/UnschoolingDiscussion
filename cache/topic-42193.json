But when they&#39;re older, I would read Shakespeare with my kids. <br/>\nBooks and even some tv shows and movies are  more comfortable for me <br/>\nbecause I can sit and pause the reading or pause the movie and <br/>\ndiscuss what is immoral with my kids. I can say this person is acting <br/>\nwrong and these were the consequences of their behavior.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a discussion (in the &#39;70&#39;s!) that said that in the<br/>\nShakespearean histories and tragedies care was taken to introduce the<br/>\nvictim characters as sympathetic people before killing them.  The<br/>\ncomparison made at that time was that in Baretta (a show about a street<br/>\ncop) characters just popped up on the screen, often with no dialog, and<br/>\nwere mown down unceremoniously.  The implication was that without<br/>\nshowing the victims of violence as sympathetic humans the viewer would<br/>\nfeel less empathy and become more callous.  What do you think?  Are<br/>\nthere more and less moral ways to depict violence and death?<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42192,"nextTopicId":42194}}
