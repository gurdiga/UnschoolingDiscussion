So rather than jump in with <br/>\na load of info, you could turn her question around and <br/>\nsay it back to her, with empathy, as if clarifying what <br/>\nshe&#39;s saying...  I&#39;m making a bad job of cutting a long <br/>\nstory short, if you want to know what I mean I can chat <br/>\nif you like :-)  Brain on melt-down due to beer atm...  <br/>\nneed more food...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I know what i wish I&#39;d said after the event!!  <br/>\nLOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jeanmarie Shingleton","from":"&quot;Jeanmarie Shingleton&quot; &lt;Jmarie_s02qlt@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TmuE6slbkuwJTtkzlIBGiDY1xo4uFPXMx3DuIDtFI7nrdQzVvexpiFzL1MtdAEIJgz3P9MytvlnjYFII9h_Medzp8_jzC0IMnUAfYzF_tEEdBk0xUAWHS-8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Need to vent!","postDate":"993226736","msgId":22690,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMTF4WUhMQlFoRXhraXlQb0gwMDAxMzE4YkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22694,"prevInTime":22689,"nextInTime":22691,"topicId":22690,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve had one of those weeks!!
