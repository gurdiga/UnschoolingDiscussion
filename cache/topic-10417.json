But I thought I&#39;d say that while these were very <br/>\nstrongly-felt topics I didn&#39;t perceive any specific bashing of anyone.  <br/>\nPerhaps this was due to my distance from the debate (I&#39;ve found in <br/>\nthe past that I&#39;ve had to keep out of certain debates cos they just <br/>\nmake me cross) but it seemed to me that (mostly) people did a <br/>\nvery good job of presenting their opinions and feelings as just that, <br/>\nopinions and feelings.  While there were some broad <br/>\ngeneralisations made, and there were some comments which were <br/>\nturned around (perhaps touching some nerves? I, obviously, don&#39;t <br/>\nknow.) most of the discussions seemed to be conducted (on points <br/>\nI both agree and disagree with) quite maturely &lt;g&gt;  If you don&#39;t <br/>\nmind me passing judgment on your behaviour &lt;bigger grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that struck me was the reaction to being posted offlist.  I <br/>\nhave always understood this to be an appropriate way of continuing <br/>\nor commenting on an on-list discussion which has worn out its <br/>\nwelcome on the list.  No doubt I&#39;ll be corrected if I&#39;m wrong, but I <br/>\nthought this was proper netiquette.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so endeth lesson no.2 &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10413,"nextTopicId":10419}}
