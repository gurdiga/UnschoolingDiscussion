I hope all will be <br/>\nclarified next Sunday. At least some of it. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nNance <br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. The best part imo was Roy Cohn&#39;s explanation of how he has sex with men <br/>\nbut is not a homosexual -- as sexual labels in DC politics and elsewhere are <br/>\nabout power -- with homosexuals of 1985 not having much of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/10/2003 11:55:45 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n**It really only takes once to become terminally ill<br/>\nwith HIV or chronically ill with herpes or syphilis,<br/>\nor even just very ill with the clap or yeast<br/>\ninfections.**<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing off on a tangent here, but did anyone see Angels in America (part <br/>\n1) on HBO on Sunday?
