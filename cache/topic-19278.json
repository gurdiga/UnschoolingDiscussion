The only thing we have<br/>\nwatched in the last few months is some of the Stanley<br/>\nCup playoff games on ESPN, Playhouse Disney in the<br/>\nmorning for the kids, or Nick Jr.  On some occassions<br/>\nwe enjoy catching shows on A&E, The History Channel,<br/>\nAnimal Planet, Discovery and The Learning Channel. <br/>\nMost of the time if we, or they, want to watch tv, we<br/>\nput in videos.  That gives us a lot more control of<br/>\nwhat they are watching, which I think at their age is<br/>\nimportant, and leaves out the ads, which I think are<br/>\nreally bad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are getting rid of cable pretty soon, as it is a<br/>\nlot of money we are spending for a service that we<br/>\nhardly utilize.  Since our tv is in the big family<br/>\nroom in the basement, that menas we probably will not<br/>\nget any reception of channels after the cable is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
