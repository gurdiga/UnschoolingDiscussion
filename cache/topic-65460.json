At the first meeting I<br/>\n  &gt; mentioned that we were unschoolers and got a few polite nods and<br/>\n  &gt; more than a few raised eyebrows.  Later a woman whispered to me that<br/>\n  &gt; she was interested in learning more about unschooling.  It was<br/>\n  &gt; obvious that she didn&#39;t want anyone to hear us!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Stick with it. Your description sounds a lot like my group when I first<br/>\n  started going. There are more unschoolers now than when I started, but more<br/>\n  importantly, some people in the group have become very close friends for me<br/>\n  and my kids. After a while, the kind of schooling people do doesn&#39;t matter<br/>\n  as much as the level of respect they have for each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Paula<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65425,"nextTopicId":65473}}
