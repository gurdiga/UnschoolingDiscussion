The scope of a child s world will grow as he grows. Therefore, his ability to self-impose will take the same steps in relation to his world. Almost all","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2132115314\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;Bridge wrote:<br/>\n&gt;Okay, let me ask you a hypothetical:<br/>\n&gt;If your child chooses to shoot up heroin because he likes it, is it <br/>\n&gt;his choice and you will allow it? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The scope of a child&#39;s world will grow as he grows. Therefore, his <br/>\nability to self-impose will take the same steps in relation to his world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost all 5yos will not have access to heroin. So the scope of their <br/>\nworld will be within the realm of TV, chores, eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid is allowed to set their own path in steps during their growth, <br/>\nthen they will not be the kind of child that needs heroin to feel <br/>\nself-worth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How about if he expresses a desire <br/>\n&gt;to be free of the monkey but needs help, will you impose forced rehab <br/>\n&gt;when he starts to relapse?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If my child is at the point that an addiction is controlling their life, <br/>\nthen I would be the last person that can help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child has self-worth and confidence, he won&#39;t be in that position. <br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t and seeks another way to deal with his pain, then I&#39;m the <br/>\none who didn&#39;t give him what he needed to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be there to offer myself to the group counselor if that would <br/>\nhelp us figure out why he has the pain to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I guess my questionis; is there any limit you would feel is okay to <br/>\n&gt;impose?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We impose health and safety rules only. And those change with age. The <br/>\nscope of their world widens, and so does the self-responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe safety issues are exposed to him in steps according to his age. For <br/>\nexample: In the wake of 911, and living in NYC, I didn&#39;t feel it was <br/>\nnecessary to tell my son what happened. He&#39;s 5 and doesn&#39;t need to have <br/>\nhis world shaken up with a rare instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe only needs to be aware of the saftey issues that fall within the realm <br/>\nof his world. Like being aware of not crossing the street alone. Being <br/>\naware to stay close to adult when at a store. Being aware that not ALL <br/>\nstrangers are nice. So without getting into too much detail, its <br/>\nimportant that he knows that people exist that will take kids from their <br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he grows and will spend more time away from me, this scope will <br/>\nbroaden. But so will his experience in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as health. There is no negotiation. We live an alternative health <br/>\nlifestyle and this is the only part of his life that has absolutes. When <br/>\nhe&#39;s old enough to take care of himself I trust he will make the best <br/>\ndecision for his health.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31704,"nextTopicId":31745}}
