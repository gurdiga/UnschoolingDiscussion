As far as we<br/>\nunderstand, the focus groups are being asked to discuss a set of<br/>\nquestions. The discussions have already begun and will continue at<br/>\nleast until later this month. The questions, as discussed last month<br/>\nat one installation in Germany, are posted on the web at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.104thasg.hanau.army.mil/Connie/questionnaire.htm\">http://www.104thasg.hanau.army.mil/Connie/questionnaire.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNHEN is in the process of drafting a letter of information that<br/>\nhomeschoolers may take with them to the focus group meetings, and we<br/>\nsolicit your input as we draft the letter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs NHEN has followed this issue, we have been struck by how similar<br/>\nthe concerns of the military, from the installation commanders on up,<br/>\nare to those of the civilian education authorities. Whether to<br/>\nregulate homeschooling, under what authority it is regulated, and how<br/>\nto regulate homeschooling are perennial issues that homeschoolers<br/>\nhave faced in all the fifty states. The questionnaires prepared for<br/>\nthe homeschool focus groups raise familiar questions, such as: &quot;How<br/>\ncan you tell the difference between homeschooling and truancy?&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;How much difficulty do homeschoolers have if they choose to<br/>\nenroll in school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a national homeschool network connecting thousands of<br/>\nhomeschoolers, NHEN can provide the military with the fruits of years<br/>\nof experience in homeschooling under many different regulations in<br/>\nall 50 states.  We are able to provide the military with information<br/>\non states that have minimal requirements and to emphasize that<br/>\nhomeschooling in those states continues to be as successful and<br/>\nproductive as in states with more onerous requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe encourage any homeschoolers who are in the military and would like<br/>\nto contribute their thoughts about NHEN&#39;s proposed letter to write us<br/>\nimmediately. Please indicate your military installation and let us<br/>\nknow anything you think would be helpful to us as we draft our<br/>\nletter. Non-military input is welcome, of course; just indicate so in<br/>\nyour response. Unless you indicate otherwise, we will treat your<br/>\nletters as confidential, meant only to help us write the best letter<br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail your responses to info@nhen within a week [before May 15] in<br/>\norder to give us your input before the letter is finished.  Later<br/>\nreplies are also welcome, as we will be following this issue through<br/>\nthe summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Board at NHEN<br/>\n<br/>\nPS from Nicky:  please feel free to post about it here on the<br/>\nLegislative Board, too.
