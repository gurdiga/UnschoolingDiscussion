I forget trying to explain unschooling and she doesn&#39;t question my choice. But...The letter I wrote started up with a lot of buttering up. Something like, <br/>\n    &quot;I know your questions about homeschooling come from your love and concern for Catherine. First off I&#39;d like to say Thank You for that. Catherine is lucky to have so many caring people in her life who have her best interests at heart.  <br/>\n    I know the choice we&#39;ve made seems strange but it&#39;s one that we made in the interests of raising a responsible, independant person who carrys a love of learning with her throughout her life. There is a lot of information out there regarding homeschooling and unschooling and I have spent a lot of time researching this. Here&#39;s a list of books, websites, etc. that you can look at for yourself and that can answer your questions better than I could.&quot;<br/>\n    I wouldn&#39;t bother explaining to much. If you give her a nice long list of resources to search out you&#39;ve made it her problem. If she chooses to do the research she may come around. If she doesn&#39;t then her refusal to do so is her responsibility and you have the right not to be dragged into any arguments she hasn&#39;t bothered to prepare herself for.<br/>\n    Other then that I&#39;d just prepare short, snippy answers in advance. About whether you&#39;re qualified maybe, &quot;I know that Mom, but she&#39;s imminently qualified to learn so I don&#39;t need to worry about teaching.&quot; But stop it there and don&#39;t get dragged into anything further. Tell her to take her list of books to the library and research. Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Something like, <br/>\n    &quot;I know your questions about homeschooling come from your love and concern for Catherine. First off I&#39;d like to say Thank You for that. Catherine is lucky to have so many caring people in her life who have her best interests at heart.  <br/>\n    I know the choice we&#39;ve made seems strange but it&#39;s one that we made in the interests of raising a responsible, independant person who carrys a love of learning with her throughout her life. There is a lot of information out there regarding homeschooling and unschooling and I have spent a lot of time researching this. Here&#39;s a list of books, websites, etc. that you can look at for yourself and that can answer your questions better than I could.&quot;<br/>\n    I wouldn&#39;t bother explaining to much. If you give her a nice long list of resources to search out you&#39;ve made it her problem. If she chooses to do the research she may come around. If she doesn&#39;t then her refusal to do so is her responsibility and you have the right not to be dragged into any arguments she hasn&#39;t bothered to prepare herself for.<br/>\n    Other then that I&#39;d just prepare short, snippy answers in advance. About whether you&#39;re qualified maybe, &quot;I know that Mom, but she&#39;s imminently qualified to learn so I don&#39;t need to worry about teaching.&quot; But stop it there and don&#39;t get dragged into anything further. Tell her to take her list of books to the library and research.

I have four children, ages 7; 3; 2 and 2 months. This is our second year of homeschooling, and in the past two years we&#39;ve run the gamut of school at home to unschooling and back to school at home and now once again into unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going home for Christmas, and I know the subject of &quot;homeschooling&quot; is going to come up. My younger brother is the only one at this point who knows we&#39;re homeschooling and he wants to know more of why, etc. I pointed him in the direction of J.T. Gatto and John Holt&#39;s writings on education and he&#39;s promised to read them so we can have an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; debate (something we used to do when growing up that I&#39;m looking forward to..it means staying up late arguing loudly, M&Ms as weapons and some Cherry Coke LOL) about the subject. He is the ONLY one in my family open to hearing me out rather than just chewing me out. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years ago when we were thinking about homeschooling, I tried to tell my mother why we were considering it, etc. and she had a COW over it. She&#39;s not at all open to  the idea. Especially because my oldest has some &quot;special needs&quot; issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nSO when we go home, and my mother realizes that Sarah&#39;s &quot;missing nearly a month of school&quot; by the time we go back home, and that I won&#39;t have a single book or assignment for her to &quot;stay caught up&quot; with...it&#39;s going to get rough. Worse when I explain that we don&#39;t use a curriculum at all, just life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not worried so much about me in all of the mess that&#39;s coming because I&#39;m used to it. There isn&#39;t a darn thing I have EVER done in my life that has been&quot;right&quot; according to my mother. But Sarah is an innocent. I&#39;ve explained to her that Grandma doesn&#39;t agree with homeschooling and that there might be an argument over it while we&#39;re there. She already knows that while we&#39;re at Grandma&#39;s house there will be a ton of rules to follow &quot;Don&#39;t touch this, don&#39;t touch that, children need to eat everything on their plates and not snack and go to bed at 6:30 pm&quot; type things. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d avoid visiting my mother if I could, but she&#39;s asked for us to come up (we&#39;ll be staying with my inlaws who are 100% supportive of us) and visit. She&#39;s never met the two youngest, only seen Logan once and Sarah three times in their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the arguments I know she&#39;ll bring up will be that it&#39;s irresponsible of me to presume that I can educate my children better than a professional. I know unschooling isn&#39;t irresponsible, but rather teaching my child to become responsible for her own self. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas how I might handle this, especially how I might keep it from becoming a major issue?
