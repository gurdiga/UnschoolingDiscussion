ARGH. This really hits me between the eyes right now, as I&#39;m honing a 4 week course on creativity. This morning I awoke with an entire meditation flowing beautifully through my mind.

I value creativity so much, and try to always provide an environment that allows for their unique explorations.<br/>\nLike Jayn, I ADORED miniature worlds as a child...still do.  I used to build small houses out of shoe boxes with my dear Grandma. We&#39;d make little beds and curtains and all sorts of furniture, I LOVED this time with her. We had these little ceramic bears that lived in my built homes, she passed them on to me a few years ago...such sweet times.
