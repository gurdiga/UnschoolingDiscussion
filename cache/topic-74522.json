Maybe, overall, it is more of a feeling-less-than kind of thing. I&#39;m realizing that I have a lot of my own feelings tied up in this: the way I felt as a kid and the ways my parents responded to me are difficult to parse out from my own relationship with my daughter. I&#39;m acutely aware of this and trying hard. An example is this: she has a friend, same age, who has a similarly intense temperament. They are quite volatile when they are together and I find myself judging my daughter for not being easy-going and easy to get along with. I KNOW that she is struggling and I recall feeling that way when I was a kid. I keep telling myself that if it&#39;s this hard for ME to manage, it&#39;s gotta be SO much harder for her, at age 8. And yet...I&#39;m not patient with her strong feelings or lack of tact, I&#39;m not kind when she reacts strongly to something that seems (to me) to be small. Her friend might say &quot;Hey, I got got a new expansion pack on SIMS!&quot; and be excited about it. My daughter might respond &quot;So what? I got ____ a week ago&quot; It seems like many compliments toward others feel like slights to her. I genuinely feel pretty happy and excited for a friend when something great is going on for them so I think I am modeling that for my kids. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m expecting my 8 year old to have the social skills or empathy to feel the same way. I suppose I&#39;m asking for help not in managing my child but in managing my own feelings about the ways she reacts. At the core of it, I think the problem is more how I react to her reactions than it is her reactions. She&#39;s 8. I&#39;m an adult. And yet I feel quite uncomfortable with her responses and reactions to many social situations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>Thanks.</span></p><p><span>C</span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74517,"nextTopicId":74513}}
