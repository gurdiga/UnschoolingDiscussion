I want to <br/>\nbe <br/>\n able to trust the kids,too, but it is very difficult.  It is as if we, the <br/>\n ex-teachers , need the de-schooling.  All the yrs as children in schools, <br/>\n then college, then teaching in the schools adds up to alot to shut out of a <br/>\n person&#39;s mind, no matter how much other philophies make sense.  I have read <br/>\n Holt, and agree with most everything I have read.  He,too, was a teacher; <br/>\n however, I don&#39;t think he was a parent.  My point is that living with <br/>\n children 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, is different than being with them for <br/>\n prescribed hours each day.  When I taught, I was not a parent.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\nKaren, what a great post!  I am so glad that we can share our challenges <br/>\nhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was also the one in my family who needed deschooling, along with my oldest <br/>\ndaughter, who had a very traumatic 4th grade year in our highly rated public <br/>\nschool system.  I still deal with my own parents (who moved south this year, <br/>\nfortunately) who were both educators and strongly oppose our home schooling.  <br/>\nThe distance has helped, as has John and I gaining confidence in what we&#39;re <br/>\ndoing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe knew over a year ago that we were going to home school, because we needed <br/>\nsomething better for our oldest.  The funny thing is that our middle daughter <br/>\nwould have had big problems in school this year, I think.  She is a born <br/>\nunschooler if there ever was one.  Very self-directed, very much a homebody, <br/>\nyet a leader and very independent in social situations.  And I think that&#39;s <br/>\nbecause she is comfortable with herself and doesn&#39;t need friends to feel <br/>\ncomplete.  Of course, she is the one that people are drawn to and she has <br/>\nmany friends.  But she simply cannot be forced to do anything she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to do.  She&#39;ll say &quot;sure&quot; or &quot;yes, ma&#39;am&quot; and blow it off.  And, at 6, <br/>\nshe is reading (can you believe this??) at a 6th or 7th grade level.  No one <br/>\ntaught her phonics, no one knows how she learned to read,  she won&#39;t do the <br/>\nspelling workbooks I have for her, but her reading, vocabulary, and writing <br/>\n(when she wants it to be), are amazing.  John and I catch ourselves all the <br/>\ntime, because it&#39;s very hard to remember that she is only 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat an incredible time this has become for me.  I think that I am the one <br/>\nwho is benefiting most from our unschooling adventure!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7628,"nextTopicId":7526}}
