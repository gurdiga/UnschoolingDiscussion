She also received a compact TV/VHS combo that we can use for travel. She loves to sing along to the music. She often sits and colors (most recently she is into those black velvet posters) while watching/listening.  I am looking for ideas for her for Xmas.  So far she has and enjoys Sound of Music, JC Superstar, Westside Story and a variety of Disney flicks (Lion King, Mary Poppins to name a few).
