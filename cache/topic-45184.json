He&#39;s a wonderful storyteller.  All his stories are<br/>\noriginal, and most are hilarious.  He often uses strong female characters.<br/>\nHe has one tape that&#39;s more for adults.  It&#39;s the one with The Herring Shed<br/>\non it.  The others are all meant for kids, but we all love them.  He reminds<br/>\nme a little bit of Robin Williams, but not quite so frenetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also lots of great children&#39;s novels available on tape.  I get<br/>\nthem for myself (because I love kid lit) and listen to them in the car.<br/>\nSome recent faves were:<br/>\n<br/>\nThunder Cave -  about a 14 year old boy whose mother dies and his<br/>\nstep-father doesn&#39;t want him.  He travels to Kenya with his mountain bike to<br/>\nlook for his father, a field biologist.  Great adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nShiva&#39;s Dance - about a girl in the south of India, who is chosen to study<br/>\ndance as a spiritual practice<br/>\n<br/>\nA Girl Named Disaster - about a girl in Africa who runs off after being<br/>\npromised in marriage to an old creep to propitiate the spirit of the man her<br/>\nfather killed before she was born.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"books on tape","postDate":"1033651914","msgId":45184,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjLjJkODRmNTRkLjJhY2RhMGNhQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45216,"prevInTime":45183,"nextInTime":45185,"topicId":45184,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/3/02 12:06:44 AM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes:  Bobby Norfolk is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-339551512\">In a message dated 10/3/02 12:06:44 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Any other favortite artist? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBobby Norfolk is popular here...he&#39;s so dang funny.
