Here is what I have discovered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy DS (16) is in Civil Air Patrol - he must be there at the appointed time, <br/>\nin uniform, ready to work.  He has a job at a theatre, he must be there on <br/>\ntime, ready to work, in uniform.  He likes the church youth group, he must be <br/>\nthere on time, ready for whatever it is they are planning (He is a student <br/>\nleader there).  Plenty of structure.  not to mention orthondist appointments, <br/>\ntime arranged with friends, etc.  He has learned about standing in line, by <br/>\nstanding in lines that mean something. (Grocery store, movie theatres, &quot;chow <br/>\nline&quot; on camping trips)<br/>\n<br/>\nDD (13) has voice/piano lesson, she has to be there on time, or lose some of <br/>\nthe lesson time.  She babysits a lot - she must be ready to go on time, or be <br/>\ndeemed unreliable and lose some jobs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDDs (8, 6, 3) have Spanish lessons - they must be ready to go on time, or <br/>\nlose out on some of the lesson ( they learned the hard way...10 minutes late <br/>\nfor a 45 minute lesson eliminates one whole game they can play.!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are PLENTY of real life things that help teach structure, timeliness, <br/>\ncourtesy, etc.  Schools manufacture these things, and are not very effective <br/>\nat it.  Have you ever SEEN a line-up of kids at a school??  All pushing and <br/>\nshoving and trying to be first....  That won&#39;t go over real well in the real <br/>\nworld....<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes self-discipline to get yourself ready for the things you want to do, <br/>\nit takes structure sometimes.  Because our children &quot;follow their bliss&quot; in <br/>\ntheir educational choices, because we see education in everything we do <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t have responsibilities too.  We have a large <br/>\nfamily (7th child is on the way) - even the 1-1/2 year old is encouraged to <br/>\npick up her toys, take her dish to the sink (where mom or dad or sibling puts <br/>\nit in sink/dishwasher).  These things are naturally learned as being part of <br/>\na family, and are an important part of their overall education.  Once a week <br/>\nor so, the children are required to pick up their rooms, they don&#39;t have to <br/>\nkeep them spotless all the time, but periodically they must be &quot;company <br/>\nready&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStep into the adventure, and notice things that already teach the stuff you <br/>\nare worried about, soon you will see a &quot;whole life education&quot; forming!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A.Y.","from":"&quot;A.Y.&quot; &lt;hooperck@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"qOULLwpQRuiMqCm1TBrPqJa6LGBayD4cIJsAe2YohH7HEEzeBDn9pcDYdoNMJhNI8P3-OlRHO2_YCH9Fp7VHkWmks3Wp","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Hi Kim and everyone","postDate":"928341309","msgId":119,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNi4xMTkuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104,"nextInTopic":127,"prevInTime":118,"nextInTime":120,"topicId":78,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In order to help my fears, I have to stop comparing my kids to other children.

We have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; for a bit over a<br/>\n&gt; year<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; now.  My understandable frustration with the public school system led me<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; take the boys out of an institution and bring them home to be raised by their<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; family.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have had a year of great frustration and stress.  Mainly because I keep<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; falling into the &quot;school at home trap&quot;.  My natural instincts do lead me<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unschooling (always have I guess), but my lack of self-confidence and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; brainwash from the system through me back into scope and sequence type<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; studies.  No, I have not yet relaxed.  when I do, I find that all of us are<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much happier.  Then I freak out and start looking to structure our day<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more!!!!  I need some balance here and to make a solid commitment to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; believing my children are intelligent enough to figure it out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On to my questions... Since I have just started a year ago, and Justin is<br/>\n&gt; 11,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is it wise to unschool him at this point?  Soon school transcripts and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; records for college will come into play, how do I manage this if I am truly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unschooling?  I have noticed that my boys backslide, lose the knowledge they<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; previously displayed, when we slack off and become more informal.  This<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; concerns me greatly, can anyone help me with this????   When the children<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doing close to nothing (usually not a problem with Justin), for quite some<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time, how do you manage that at my boys&#39; ages?  All those books on the shelf<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that they never touch, how do you get them interested, or do I just keep<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dusting?!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I apologize for sounding so ignorant... it is quite embarassing in fact.<br/>\n&gt;  But<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I truly need the help and advice of &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers who have had<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; several years under their belts watching their children grow and trusting<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; their children.  I want to somewhat settle into a way of living where I am<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not constantly second guessing myself, irritating my children, feeling<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; totally inadequate, and spending way too much money on things that don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; belong in my home!

My natural instincts do lead me to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling (always have I guess), but my lack of self-confidence and<br/>\n&gt; brainwash from the system through me back into scope and sequence type<br/>\n&gt; studies.  No, I have not yet relaxed.  when I do, I find that all of us are<br/>\n&gt; much happier.  Then I freak out and start looking to structure our day<br/>\n&gt; more!!!!  I need some balance here and to make a solid commitment to<br/>\n&gt; believing my children are intelligent enough to figure it out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On to my questions... Since I have just started a year ago, and Justin is 11,<br/>\n&gt; is it wise to unschool him at this point?  Soon school transcripts and<br/>\n&gt; records for college will come into play, how do I manage this if I am truly<br/>\n&gt; unschooling?  I have noticed that my boys backslide, lose the knowledge they<br/>\n&gt; previously displayed, when we slack off and become more informal.  This<br/>\n&gt; concerns me greatly, can anyone help me with this????   When the children are<br/>\n&gt; doing close to nothing (usually not a problem with Justin), for quite some<br/>\n&gt; time, how do you manage that at my boys&#39; ages?  All those books on the shelf<br/>\n&gt; that they never touch, how do you get them interested, or do I just keep<br/>\n&gt; dusting?!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I apologize for sounding so ignorant... it is quite embarassing in fact.  But<br/>\n&gt; I truly need the help and advice of &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers who have had<br/>\n&gt; several years under their belts watching their children grow and trusting<br/>\n&gt; their children.  I want to somewhat settle into a way of living where I am<br/>\n&gt; not constantly second guessing myself, irritating my children, feeling<br/>\n&gt; totally inadequate, and spending way too much money on things that don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; belong in my home!

One is the reason<br/>\nI took my 5 year old daughter out of school, MAJOR frustration with the system<br/>\nand teacher.<br/>\nAnother is feeling totally inadequate, when it comes to unschooling.

I&#39;ve read a lot of John Holt and other unschoolers, read Growing<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Without Schooling and have attended an unschooling conference. But I still<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;sometimes feel insecure about unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it&#39;s a combination of two factors.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First, I was brainwashed by our &quot;scope and sequence&quot; education culture and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;tough to go against that way of thinking. Intellectually I think unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;makes sense. People remember, and build on, information that they are interested<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;in and have a use for. They have to struggle to remember things they are learning<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;for a test. Then they promptly forget them. That phenomenon is the best argument<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;for unschooling I think.
