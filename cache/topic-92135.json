My dh has all the construction skills...but I have picked up a few along the way &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started with paneling and cheap drywall that had holes in it.  (Part of our house is a 30 year old mobile home).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWELL, over the years I&#39;ve gotten little tidbits of information about what I could do.  My husband helped me hang lawan (Sp?) plywood over the walls that needed fixed.  Then I primed everything and hung wallpaper liner (what GREAT STUFF!!!).  I just finished priming the liner today, and priming the ceiling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI spackled some trouble spots, and have to go back and get some air bubbles out (which has an easy fix I didn&#39;t know about!!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully tomorrow, we can start painting the colored paint on.  She wants dark blue with baby blue sponge painted, and stars/moons on the ceiling in glow in the dark paint.  Then we&#39;ll finish it off with moulding and trim.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is going to be SOOOOO cool!!!!  And all for less than $200.  We have to get a new carpet for her room, so that will be more, but I&#39;m hoping to find a remnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first total project I&#39;ve done by myself, and I am soooooo pleased!  <br/>\nI just had to share!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92143,"nextTopicId":92156}}
