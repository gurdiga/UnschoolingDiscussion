They know I <br/>\nwill just give a vague answer and ignore them.<br/>\nSeiously.<br/>\nI have a pretty strong personality and everyone just leaves me the hell <br/>\nalone in my family. I mean really, if someone was nosy enough to ask me <br/>\n&quot;what are you doing to fix the problem?&quot; the answer could range from <br/>\ntruth to none of your business depending on the person, my relationship <br/>\nto them and their adittude about our life choices. I have a habit of <br/>\nthrowing information out to folks (stuff that I know will entail long, <br/>\ndrawn out discussions that I just can&#39;t abide) and then walking away.<br/>\n Its amazing how well this works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; It could confuse a child to be told that the parent doesn&#39;t believe <br/>\n&gt; something is a problem when the parent encourages the child to tell <br/>\n&gt; people it IS a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well YMMV, but ds (13)  is not confused.<br/>\nHe gets the whole idea of  telling folks one thing to just get them to <br/>\nleave you alone. He knows that dh and I feel he fine as he is and know <br/>\nthat when and if he wants to read on a higher level he will.<br/>\n He does not like answering personal questions nor being grilled by <br/>\nadults so this is the way he (and please understand it really was HIS <br/>\nchoice) has chosen to deal with it. With most people and kids its stops <br/>\nthe questions AND makes folks in say a co-op learning situation not ask <br/>\nhim to read something...which he lives in serious fear of. I have to <br/>\nstate again that this will not work for all kids, and most kids do not <br/>\nhave this hyper fear of humiliation that my ds has. Its just part of his <br/>\npersonality. He never, ever wants to be singled out or put on the spot. <br/>\nIts one of the reasons he does not play sports.<br/>\nI find that in some situations its just easier to lie to folks who are <br/>\nasking questions that are intrusive and not their business....I feel <br/>\nthat way about my local goverment too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it would be better in the long run to help your son find ways <br/>\n&gt; to deflect inquiries into his reading to discussions of things he <br/>\n&gt; enjoys and does well.

They see he is not &quot;slow&quot; as some would put it. The <br/>\nword dyslexic helps them to answer why, without me having to have long, <br/>\nannoying conversations about learning, unschooling, how kids learn ect. <br/>\nwith them and the hurt feelings/anger/misunderstandings that might <br/>\nensue. My parents having this information then diseminated it to others <br/>\nwithin the family not as friendly about homeschooling (like my wonderful <br/>\nsister who thinks it should be ilegal....thank God she lives in Iowa) or <br/>\nwith as close a relationship with ds thus shutting down unwelcome <br/>\ndiscussions and questions. Periodicly one of them will ask how his <br/>\nreading is going and I&#39;ll say &quot;just fine&quot; (firmly) and that keeps them <br/>\nhappy.<br/>\n(also I guess my 1st email made it sound like we have a problem with my <br/>\nparents, we really don&#39;t (and MIL lives too far away and does not <br/>\nvisit....plus she just ignores the fact we homeschool, would not <br/>\nunderstand unschooling or even relaxed homeschooling and knows not to <br/>\ntell me how to raise my child) I ment that in other families with <br/>\nGrandparents who seem to think its any of their business what your kid <br/>\nis doing this could be one way to not have to deal with endless <br/>\nquestions, pop quizes, and forced reading.)<br/>\nIt has taken years of conditioning to get my parents and MIL to this <br/>\npoint of leaving us alone...their training began the day my MIL fed my <br/>\nexclusivly breast-fed, top of the chart 4 month old &quot;cereal&quot; when we <br/>\nleft him (along with bottles of breast milk) with her for 4 hours while <br/>\nwe went to dh&#39;s class reunion....she never tried to usurp our position <br/>\nas parents again. Lukily my mom has always been the mom/mil that anyone <br/>\ncould hope for. She (which means then dad) nevers nags, criticizes or <br/>\noffers advice unless asked 1st. She is this way because her mother and <br/>\nMIL were always in her business and swore she would never be that way.<br/>\n&quot;Its your lives, you have to make your own decisions.&quot;<br/>\nThey know he has never been the kid who would do &quot;school&quot; stuff for them <br/>\nto prove he knew something. He always hated to even sing a song he might <br/>\nhave learned for them (&quot;Sing that song you sang for me for Grammy, <br/>\nsweetie&quot;).<br/>\nFor ds this is the way he has chosen to deal with inquiries, for others <br/>\nit would not work.<br/>\n<br/>\nTruthfully I&#39;m not mean or cruel. I would love to speard the gospel of <br/>\nunschooling to everyone I know. But I do not have time nor the energy to <br/>\ndeal with all the angst that would go with it from some folks. Its <br/>\neasier to just let them belive what they will, tell them what they need <br/>\nto hear and be firm when they step over the line. maybe when ds has <br/>\ngrown and gone onto shine in his own special way I will take up the <br/>\nfight in case he makes the same choices as a parent as we have.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said.

Maybe they can learn the basics, but will always be slow or have difficulty in those areas.  This is not seen as a &quot;problem&quot; in our society.  We accept that not everyone needs to be musically talented or a whiz at math.  As long as a person can do math well enough to balance their checkbook and pay their bills, we feel they will be OK.

We talk about grade level, fluency, and speed as if these are relevant to one&#39;s ability to function in life.  Where is the evidence that the ability to read quickly and easily is truly important?  Although I love to read, outside of school I can&#39;t think of any situations in which it has been important for me to read easily or at &quot;grade level&quot;.  Sure there are some fields that may require that ability, just as some fields require high-level mathematical competency or musical talent.  No single skill is needed for all jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs our society advances technologically, there are increasing numbers of ways for people to get information.  We are no longer dependent on reading as a major source of information -- except in our schools!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately for most children, the belief persists that reading is a skill that must be measured and mastered before higher learning can occur.
