Thought I&#39;d share too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you un/home school?  I am a teacher by profession (actually I never<br/>\nwent beyond getting my degree and doing my student teaching) and what I saw<br/>\nthe children experience in class made me realize that I would never want<br/>\nthat experience for my child.  There are great teachers out there, but the<br/>\ninstitution of school is not (in my opinion) healthy for kids.  I also<br/>\nreally enjoy spending time with him, learning together and having fun.  We<br/>\nwould miss out on so much if he was at school most of the day.  The other<br/>\npart that concerns me is the peer experience, where his peers (mainly) would<br/>\nbe teaching him how to relate to others...I think a mix of ages is better<br/>\nfor teaching social skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your child&#39;s age?  I have one son, Nick, who is five.  He is really<br/>\ninto anything having to do with space exploration.  Yesterday we had a great<br/>\ntime making a space buggy and star light-catcher.  He is also really into<br/>\nknights and swords.  He, like some of the other little boys descibed on this<br/>\nlist, is into Pajama Sam games, majicians and carrying special treasures in<br/>\nhis pockets!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do you live?<br/>\nWe live in Olympia, Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you satisfied with the HS laws in the state?  Yes.  As I understand it,<br/>\nWashington has some of the most liberal homeschooling laws.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther information:  We attend, not as often as I would like, the Unitarian<br/>\nUniversalist church in our area and really enjoy it.  I enjoy gardening and<br/>\nknitting.  My husband works in the environmental field.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking foward to getting to know you!<br/>\nTiffany</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9016,"nextTopicId":9070}}
