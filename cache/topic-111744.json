I remember carrying Kathryn around when she a week shy of 1  <br/>\nnattering on about what I was doing. As I was looking all over for  <br/>\nher hat I said &quot;Where&#39;s you&#39;re hat?&quot; not really expecting her to  <br/>\nunderstand what I was saying but she not only understood but had  <br/>\nwatched someone put it up on the mantle at some point during the day  <br/>\nand she pointed right at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They do not need two or three labels for an object thrown at them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that sounds totally sensible. If an adult were learning a  <br/>\nforeign language they&#39;d be irritated to have several names thrown at  <br/>\nthem for things they were trying to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet it just doesn&#39;t hold up against reality for babies. They  <br/>\naren&#39;t consciously thinking about making a connection between a sound  <br/>\n(word) they hear and an object the way adults try to when learning a  <br/>\nlanguage. They just absorb it all and connections get made in the  <br/>\nbackground as the brain does whatever it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t make sense that multiple words for a single thing wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nconfuse them, but the brain seems to take it in stride as though  <br/>\nthat&#39;s a given. We don&#39;t really understand how the brain manages to  <br/>\norganize the input it gets so perhaps the brain *is* set up  <br/>\nspecifically to accept multiple names for things because we need to  <br/>\ncategorize things.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven without baby talk a cat isn&#39;t just a cat it&#39;s an animal, pet,  <br/>\ncat, kitty, Allie, warm, fuzzy, nice .... and so on. The brain  <br/>\nmanages to sort out -- because we *do* use multiple names for things  <br/>\n-- that each word is a set that includes 1 or more objects. It&#39;s the  <br/>\nkey to our ability to categorize things. For Kathryn, the word Allie  <br/>\nwas a set of 1. The word kitty may have been a set of 2 until she  <br/>\nrealized it applied to all creatures that had a resemblance to Allie  <br/>\nand Zoomer. She may have thought pets also meant only Allie and  <br/>\nZoomer but as she encountered more uses of the word, she expanded and  <br/>\nrefined her meaning. (Interestingly it took a while for Kathryn to  <br/>\nfigure out how to say Zoomer so she called both cats Allie and yet if  <br/>\nasked &quot;Where&#39;s Allie?&quot; she&#39;d never point at Zoomer and she would  <br/>\npoint at Zoomer when asked &quot;Where&#39;s Zoomer?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRelated to the categorizing thought, some kids go through a stage of  <br/>\nthinking Daddy means man so all men are called Daddy. But through use  <br/>\nand context they shortly get it sorted it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo adding another baby talk word on top of all the words kids hear  <br/>\nfor a single object really isn&#39;t a problem at all for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nAnswers to common unschooling questions:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\nBlog of writing prompts for speculative fiction writers:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dragonwritingprompts.blogsome.com/\">http://dragonwritingprompts.blogsome.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] better verbiage","postDate":"1139516514","msgId":111886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDODg0OEZGLTQzQzctNDM0Qi04NUFCLTREMTA2Q0RCQ0E3OEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNWEwMWM2MmQ5ZiQ4ODhjZDllMCQ1ZDUwZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwNWEwMWM2MmQ5ZiQ4ODhjZDllMCQ1ZDUwZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4="},"prevInTopic":111885,"nextInTopic":111888,"prevInTime":111885,"nextInTime":111887,"topicId":111744,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

None of my children have limited<br/>\nvocabularies...and one of them didn&#39;t talk until 3 years old.<br/>\nHe just turned five and tells me that &quot;we breathe in oxygen and plants<br/>\nbreath out oxygen&quot;....pretty good vocabulary for only talking the last<br/>\ntwo years.:) He called nursing &quot;na-na&#39;s&quot; and still has some funny<br/>\nwords for stuff that we use right along with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=XeERtAmMH6xOclFlfF3kXw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=89oOLkTPWnhxf__b2u72QA&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=1aW-X2S2ZokW3qzZ8RgBsQ&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch</a><br/>\nool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+sc<br/>\nhool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+californi<br/>\na&c=6&s=181&.sig=ekWG86FHE6rjFjd8jaZHOw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nNew<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=aSJE8BjHS18knvLinwtebQ&gt;  york school education <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu</a><br/>\nate+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Mi<br/>\nddle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+ca<br/>\nlifornia&c=6&s=181&.sig=gkGybS6R2TNc7Ffa1FldiA&gt;  education in california <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

Even my gallumphing great 13 year <br/>\nold likes to hear words he used as a tiny child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy using these words in quiet times, it helps bring us even closer.  <br/>\nDon&#39;t &quot;miffins&quot; sound much cozier and more comfortable than &quot;mittens&quot;?  <br/>\nI would certainly never ask my son if he wanted mashed &quot;taboes&quot; in front <br/>\nof his friends, but when I do it in private, he knows I am remembering <br/>\nthe adorable lad he was and missing that toddler a little, as much as I <br/>\nappreciate the fine young man he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, listening to them wonder aloud why they thought &quot;geeleeup&quot; <br/>\nwas a good word for car, or &quot;go gos&quot; meant their little plastic Fisher <br/>\nPrice people, we look at each other and smile.  It usually starts a <br/>\nspate of &quot;Remember .... remember...&quot; and I get to see their perceptions <br/>\nof our early days together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always used proper terms and no &quot;baby talk&quot; around my children, <br/>\nand I never corrected my children&#39;s pronounciation unless they asked -- <br/>\nI knew that too soon they would leave behind their lisps and other <br/>\nchildish ways.  And they have.  I did honor their attempts by using some <br/>\nof &quot;their&quot; words, though -- it was only fair; they were trying to use <br/>\nmine. <br/>\n<br/>\nI taught English as a Second Language for years, and it never failed to <br/>\nbring a smile to the lips of a struggling student when I could use a <br/>\nword or two of their language.  It showed them I respected the language <br/>\nand culture they already had.  How could I do less for my own children?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;baby&quot; turned six on Monday -- every day her vocabulary becomes a <br/>\nlittle more &quot;adult&quot;.

If you look <br/>\nat things like Multiple Intelligences and Myers-Briggs personality <br/>\ntypes (in a general sense), they say what unschoolers all say - not <br/>\neveryone works, thinks, or learns the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven in an environment from birth with total freedom, lack of <br/>\nprejudice, access to info of all types... there will still be a <br/>\npercentage of children who learn best by listening to an &quot;expert&quot; <br/>\nexplain a topic, then being allowed to &quot;quiz&quot; themselves on the <br/>\nknowledge they have gained. The key is really comprehending what are <br/>\nthe strengths and weaknesses of a child, adressing them, and giving <br/>\nthem freedom to adapt the best they can. Some kids may actually <br/>\nlearn best in a school environment, and to truly unschool is to give <br/>\nthe child that freedom to explore that possibility. To shield them <br/>\nfrom a certain type of learning, because we see it as &quot;traditional&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;forced&quot; might be just as harmful as forcing a child into it (if <br/>\nthe parents take care to explain to them what they see as <br/>\ndetrimental aspects of school, and that the child has no obligation <br/>\nto stay there if they no longer feel it is for them).<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine mentioned this:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The &quot;danger&quot; in strewing schooly things comes when the parent isnt <br/>\n&gt;really all that convinced about unschooling, and when they place a <br/>\n&gt;higher priority on learning that &quot;looks educational&quot; than learning <br/>\n&gt;that is simply fun.

Parents don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot;  <br/>\nthem the words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd English&#39;s greatest strength (and most irritating to those who  <br/>\nlearn it as adults, I&#39;ve heard) is that very FEW things have only one  <br/>\nname.  Yet we don&#39;t have to teach children the other words; they pick  <br/>\nthem up naturally and sort them however their brain is organized.  I  <br/>\nhave associations with words, like where I&#39;ve heard them, the first  <br/>\ntime I remember hearing them (in some cases), whether they&#39;re archaic  <br/>\nor recent, often what language they&#39;re from, what they sound like...   <br/>\nWe can&#39;t predict or recommend to our kids how they will learn or  <br/>\nremember words; they have their own ways of learning and remembering  <br/>\nand sorting.<br/>\n<br/>\n From an article at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/words:\">http://sandradodd.com/words:</a><br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day when Kirby was a toddler, his dad said carefully and clearly,  <br/>\n&quot;Kirby, close the cabinet.&quot; Kirby gazed back with no understanding.  <br/>\nKeith tried again sweetly: &quot;Close the cabinet!&quot; Nothing.

He walked at a little over 13 months and was amazed at our<br/>\nhappy response. I talked to him a lot every where we went even if people<br/>\nthought I was crazy. I never used baby talk. My point of view is why make<br/>\nchildren work harder then they need to? Teach one word and stick with it. My<br/>\nmom still calls medicine - meems.

I am never sure what he gets<br/>\nfrom any activity we participate in, anything he watches or conversations we<br/>\nhave. He always looks like he is paying attention to something only he can<br/>\nhear. Then days, weeks and sometimes months later he will ask me some<br/>\nquestion or tell me something that makes me think to myself, &quot;WOW! He got<br/>\nit!&quot; It just occurred to me why he doesn&#39;t play with the spelling stuff he<br/>\nhas - some how he just gets it and he doesn&#39;t need the stuff he has - he<br/>\nneeds something at a higher level.

Anyone want to give me better verbage?)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn short my son is a thinker - then comes his sister who is almost 14<br/>\nmonths. She is my doer. She doesn&#39;t stop moving even when she is sleeping.<br/>\nShe is surrounded by her brother, and three cousins 6, 7, and 9 and sees all<br/>\nthey are doing and she can&#39;t wait to join in. She lifted her head early, sat<br/>\nup and walked just before a year.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShe loves finger songs and books and is amazingly gentle even with paper<br/>\nbooks. She loves emptying any container and amazing to me anyway she is<br/>\ngetting the concept that you don&#39;t put everything in your mouth. She gets<br/>\nthat crayons put color on paper though I see some wall battles as a<br/>\npossibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, sorry to babble on for so long. you sound a lot like me.
