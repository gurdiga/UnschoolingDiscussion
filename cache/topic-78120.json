One of my jobs is <br/>\nto provide parenting religious education. Early on, I discovered that the most <br/>\nimportant part is a place for parents to talk about those hard days where <br/>\nyou&#39;re sure you&#39;re screwing up, or you&#39;re not liking your kids much, or you&#39;re <br/>\njust tired and scared. All the other stuff is good and useful, but that space <br/>\nwhere we confess those things that we fear is ONLY us is vital.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnne Lamott wrote a book called &quot;Operating Instructions&quot; about being a single <br/>\nparent of an infant, about the time I was parenting a wee one. My favorite <br/>\npart of the book is where she says something like &quot;It&#39;s not working out. Sam is <br/>\ngoing to have to go back.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I think every parent has felt like that, but we don&#39;t hear about it <br/>\noften. I LOVED it when Sandra expressed her relief when her daughter started <br/>\nreading pretty recently. Because this parenting stuff is scary anyway, and <br/>\nunschooling is an enormous act of faith!   Intellectually, we know it works and <br/>\nit&#39;s going to be okay, but sometimes we all get terrified. We also get tired, <br/>\nimpatient, jealous, exasperated, etc., etc. -- just like everyone else. Doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean we&#39;re bad people or bad parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo...confess. I bet for every Bad Mommy or Daddy moment you share, there&#39;ll <br/>\nbe a dozen people who say &quot;Me too!&quot; and twenty more who can&#39;t say it out loud, <br/>\nbut are still relieved that it happened to someone else too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78117,"nextTopicId":1562}}
