Over choices and expectations. It is my truth that giving children <br/>\ncontrol over their own choices, limits and expectations for their own lives <br/>\nis at the core of unschooling, special needs or no.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I type this, Casey at age 9, is having a frustration tantrum in the next <br/>\nroom that neither Jon nor I can break through. She&#39;s moaning and flailing <br/>\nlike she&#39;s possessed. I&#39;ve tried all my loving, caring and understanding <br/>\nways. I&#39;ve tried hugging and distracting and reasoning and breathing <br/>\nsuggestions. I&#39;ve tried moving her and letting her be. It&#39;s not working. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a pain in her soul right now that I cannot seem to reach. As a <br/>\nmother, this is very hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s not the unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we&#39;re all just going to ride this one out till she&#39;s exhausted. So <br/>\nhard. After it&#39;s over I&#39;ll try again to connect with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, I understand extremes. I just try VERY hard to not let her emotions <br/>\nbecome my emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58678,"nextTopicId":58980}}
