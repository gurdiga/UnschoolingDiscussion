I&#39;m saying that the person <br/>\nwho posts should be able to say Listen, you misunderstood me.  I agree with <br/>\nyou that on the list it messes up the discussions.  That doesn&#39;t stop  me <br/>\nfrom thinking that, theoretically, we could all try to be more diplomatic.  I <br/>\nagree that you&#39;re right.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily help to point out to OTHER <br/>\npeople what we thought was not diplomatic.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I do too - but it isn&#39;t a clearcut line for me -&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  Is anything really clearcut.  Again, however, I wasn&#39;t talking about <br/>\nME judging other&#39;s posts to  put on a label of diplomatic or not.  As Joyce <br/>\npointed out, I can only control my own actions.  The point of my posts has <br/>\nbeen to try to encourage people on this list to think about these issues <br/>\nwhile they&#39;re posting...not that we should all be quick to point out things <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t like after the posting has been done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wrote<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and otherwise, that we can still address grievances or issues with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; diplomacy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and Pam wrote:<br/>\n&gt; If you knew that (1) it wouldn&#39;t make any difference at all in how people <br/>\n&gt; post - that those who are less diplomatic will still be less diplomatic - <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; if you also knew (2) that comments on how other listmembers post - even <br/>\n&gt; gentle general reminders to be more diplomatic - would frequently lead to <br/>\n&gt; long and acrimonious sidetracks away from the subject of the list, would <br/>\n&gt; you <br/>\n&gt; still think it was a good idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(1)  Yes, that&#39;s the way it will be in life.  Again, I was ONLY talking about <br/>\npersonal responsibility.  That we all might think about diplomacy and tact <br/>\nwhen we post and that once in awhile, a general discussion about those issues <br/>\nis not going to, IMHO, hurt anyone.  I totally agree that we will never get <br/>\nanywhere, and in fact will be pulled down into the muck, if we start judging <br/>\neach person&#39;s comments as to whether or not they are considering other;s <br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2)  I agree that general reminders frequently lead to sidetracks and, as you <br/>\nsaid, it&#39;s bad for the list.  Again I want to emphasize that  I didn&#39;t mean <br/>\nthat we should pick each other&#39;s posts apart for examples of diplomacy or <br/>\nnon-diplomacy(is that a word &lt;G&gt;?) <br/>\n<br/>\n I just mean that I don&#39;t think it hurts to once in awhile have this <br/>\ndiscussion...What is the difference between honesty and rudeness?  How can we <br/>\nget a point across while striving not to hurt others?  These are topics I <br/>\nthink this list and many groups can address generally, without necessarily <br/>\npointing out what we feel were &quot;slights&quot; in other people&#39;s posts.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard in this format, because if we were conversing and I had written <br/>\n&gt; &gt; something about the diaper training analogy and somebody said something <br/>\n&gt; &gt; different than what I meant, I could just say...Oh, I didn&#39;t mean it that <br/>\n&gt; &gt; way.  Here is what I meant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; and Pam responded:<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I think things would go a lot more smoothly on a lot of email lists if <br/>\n&gt; people <br/>\n&gt; DID exactly what you are saying here. If they feel like someone posted a <br/>\n&gt; rude <br/>\n&gt; response to them and that they were misunderstood, it would be GREAT if <br/>\n&gt; they <br/>\n&gt; came back with, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t mean that...here&#39;s what I meant.&quot; But that <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t the same as coming back and saying, &quot;I didn&#39;t like your response to <br/>\n&gt; me. <br/>\n&gt; I just want to say that you should take the time to reword your posts to be <br/>\n&gt; more sensitive and considerate.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes-this IS what I meant.  I don&#39;t think, either, that we should say &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike your <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; response to me.  I&#39;m talking about what I as POSTER can do...it&#39;s much more <br/>\n&gt; pro-active to do as you suggest and say...wait a minute, this is what I <br/>\n&gt; meant.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pam wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;You&#39;re doing fine... one of the most GRATIFYING things I noticed was <br/>\n&gt; that we all improved our ability to communicate in writing quite <br/>\n&gt; dramatically <br/>\n&gt; over those first few years.

I just want you to know, Caro, that I&#39;m not really <br/>\n&gt; intending <br/>\n&gt; to do that to you - in fact, I ONLY do this when I think people have really <br/>\n&gt; put an extra helping of good hard thinking into their posts and that there <br/>\n&gt; are enough ideas there worth responding to point-by-point.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for this, too.

I like to list things - point (1) and point (2) and so on. Some people <br/>\nappreciate the organization of that kind of writing and others feel like it <br/>\nis sort of cold and it turns them off. Everybody&#39;s style works better for <br/>\nsome people than for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - by the way - some people feel attacked and picked apart when people <br/>\nrespond to their posts point-by-point, quoting bits and responding, like I <br/>\nhave done here. I just want you to know, Caro, that I&#39;m not really intending <br/>\nto do that to you - in fact, I ONLY do this when I think people have really <br/>\nput an extra helping of good hard thinking into their posts and that there <br/>\nare enough ideas there worth responding to point-by-point. <br/>\n<br/>\n  --pamS<br/>\nSome of what is said here may challenge you, shock you, disturb you, or seem <br/>\nharsh. But remember that people are offering it to be helpful and what feels <br/>\nuncomfortable to you might be just what someone else needed to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87358,"authorName":"Burkfamily@aol.com","from":"Burkfamily@...","profile":"burke92000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Learning consideration (was Other people&#39;s posting s...","postDate":"1020307710","msgId":36636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJkLjFjOTAxYzdhLjJhMDIwMmZlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36635,"nextInTopic":36642,"prevInTime":36635,"nextInTime":36637,"topicId":36635,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/1/2002 12:40:37 PM Central Daylight Time, ...
