I have had<br/>\n&gt;squirmy feelings about unit studies. In some ways they are better than some<br/>\n&gt;other types of &#39;school&#39; work but they always feel somewhat contrived to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes...I hear you! I have forked out some fairly hefty Canadian dollars on<br/>\nunit studies that sound fabulous but the girls get turned off very quickly<br/>\nby these now. I think that perhaps it is the fact that they are getting<br/>\nolder and realize that they can self-direct their learning. I am happy<br/>\nabout that ...so I am organizing a Used Curriculum Fair and will sell<br/>\neverything &#39;unit-study-ish&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I got smart and figured this all out I purchased Beyond Five in a<br/>\nROw. The girls had loved Five in a ROw when they were younger so I just<br/>\nfigured they would love Beyond...<br/>\nBut things had changed. There were eye-rolls all around when I started in<br/>\nwith the Beyond Five in a Row. They had outgrown that type of adult-led<br/>\nlearning. They enjoy it when I facilitate, they don&#39;t mind when I suggest,<br/>\nbut they clearly don&#39;t like being led. <br/>\nBook closed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBrooke <br/>\nlooking at a grey sky but no snow yet....<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brynlee@...\">brynlee@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4284,"nextTopicId":4310}}
