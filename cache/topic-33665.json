Some of us - take it to heart a little too much :) We could speculate whether that&#39;s just related to personality or lack of/too much praise growing up... For example - I am a 28 year old woman who still will tell my dad what grades I get in the college courses I take -  how sad is that - <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, with children I think it is sometimes easy to see the things they are doing wrong as opposed to the great things they are doing. I also think kids see through patronization vs. real praise. I agree that a simple acknowledgement of - hey, you did a great job with that - is nice to hear - as long as it is the truth!

I find my daughter has a hard time writing, She is 7, and seems to not want to write anything because she is such a perfectionist that if it not perfect, she gets really mad at herself. Her writing at this point is far from perfect - as is her spelling-  I have used Math curriculum in the past and she is great with math - She reads really well, but I have never used a phonics, spelling, writing curriculum and was wondering if there was a connection there?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have any suggestions on what helps writing, and spelling develop? I have also read that sometimes motor skills develop at different levels - I notice she really presses hard with her pens/pencils - she says her hand hurts - maybe she just isn&#39;t ready? I really try not to worry about it - but it&#39;s hard ... I think being able to write(not necessarily beautiful) and clearly express yourself is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts??<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: zenmomma * <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, March 24, 2002 9:38 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] But how do you know they are learning?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was thinking the other day about the age old question we are all <br/>\n  GUARANTEED to hear at least once (more likely 100&#39;s of times) while we are <br/>\n  unschooling. &quot;But how do you know they are learning?&quot; My usual answer is &quot;I <br/>\n  talk to them.&quot; The truth of this statement was brought home to me this week <br/>\n  when I took Casey to a new Children&#39;s Museum.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At each exhibit and doing each craft, I knew exactly where Casey was with <br/>\n  it.
