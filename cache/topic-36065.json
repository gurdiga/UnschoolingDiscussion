The author does also discuss, in her introduction to<br/>\nthe essay section, the problems of different people&#39;s &quot;purity&quot; of<br/>\nunschooling, as she puts it (p. 51-2, if you&#39;re looking for it).  She<br/>\ncomments that she was somewhat lenient on that point, and I think perhaps<br/>\nthat was a mistake, since it&#39;s contradictory to unschooling as she defined<br/>\nit in the first chapters.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I&#39;ll still stand by my original recommnedation.
