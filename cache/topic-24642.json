The impression I get is that they think I should sit back<br/>\n&gt; and watch my kids do absolutely nothing because that&#39;s okay, they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; learn anyway.  Well, it isn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 6 years now.<br/>\n&gt; This is our seventh year.  There is no structure to our study but if I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t set some rules and limits, Rachel will hole up in her room and let<br/>\n&gt; her depression take her over despite the prozac and Wyndham is just<br/>\n&gt; Wyndham and you have to meet him to understand.<br/>\n&gt; If you have such a narrow view of unschooling that you cannot allow any<br/>\n&gt; parental control at all, that makes you no better in my book than Mr.<br/>\n&gt; Farris who takes the opposite view to the extreme.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the problem is is that for some of us, unschooling IS a lifestyle,<br/>\n&gt; not just an education style.  The line is very blurry between unschooling<br/>\n&gt; and what some might consider &quot;unparenting&quot;.  By allowing your children total<br/>\n&gt; control over their lives can be a wonderful thing, but there do need to be<br/>\n&gt; limits.  Some of us seem to need to have more limits than others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am struggling with this problem right now and I have found this discussion<br/>\n&gt; very interesting and I am enjoying everyones opinions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, I think there are people on this list who are true unschoolers,<br/>\n&gt; who let their kids do whatever all day, but have a set lunch and dinnertime<br/>\n&gt; or family time (when dad gets home).  Others (like myself) stock the kitchen<br/>\n&gt; with nutritious foods and allow the kids to help themselves when their<br/>\n&gt; hungry.  If they eat ice cream for breakfast on occasion, I don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; care, because most mornings they have cereal and fruit, or yogurt, or even a<br/>\n&gt; sandwich.  They get help when they need it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Others may allow their kids to fall asleep whenever, but other families need<br/>\n&gt; a set bedtime.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These extraneous issues (bedtime, TV, Nintendo, etc) are more of parenting<br/>\n&gt; issues than educational issues.  I can see the validity of both sides.  But<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t feel that someone who limits TV can&#39;t be an unschooler; however<br/>\n&gt; someone who requires a certain amount of schoolwork (usually reading,<br/>\n&gt; writing/spelling, and/or math) a day is a relaxed homeschooler, not an<br/>\n&gt; unschooler.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Radical unschoolers allow the philosophy to spill over into all areas of<br/>\n&gt; life, not just education while the less radical folk need a more<br/>\n&gt; authoritarian parenting style.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this is making sense.  I think some of this discussion has been<br/>\n&gt; because of the blurred the lines between unschooling and parenting, and like<br/>\n&gt; I said, I&#39;m still trying to figure out where that line is in my own family.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t feel that my children are wild and run amok or are rude and<br/>\n&gt; undisciplined.  I feel that they are capable (ie they use knives and<br/>\n&gt; scissors, stoneware dishes and regular glassware, help cook, etc).  Some<br/>\n&gt; would feel we are &quot;unsafe&quot; but it is amazing how capable young kids can be<br/>\n&gt; if allowed to use some things that &quot;only grown-ups&quot; should use (after being<br/>\n&gt; shown how and supervised etc).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Janet, mom to Caroline, 6, and Thomas, 3<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
