Believe me when I tell you it is NOT worth the money and<br/>\nBrittany does NOT need it to learn to read.  Those commercials make their<br/>\nprogram sound so fun and easy, but really it&#39;s just tedium in a box. My<br/>\nCasey got sucked in by those commercials once and asked me to get her that<br/>\nprogram. We borrowed it from the library. She was bored in one day. She was<br/>\nNOT however bored with learning to read. Just the simplistic phonics only<br/>\napproach that this system was using.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had much more fun and lots of success using a playful, relaxed and varied<br/>\napproach. Everything in that expensive phonics program can be found much<br/>\nbetter in real life. There are books from the library, blocks, magnetic<br/>\nletters, workbooks from the grocery (for playing, NOT enforcing of course),<br/>\ngames like Scrabble and Boggle, computer games, magazines, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest your local library as one of the best resources around. If<br/>\nyou feel a need to brush up on those phonics rules for yourself (so you can<br/>\nhelp Brittany), there are tons of books on the subject.

The ads make it look like it&#39;s fun for the kids.<br/>\nAnd it might be. But how much are you willing to spend on a fun way to do<br/>\nsomething that will happen naturally for free? How much would you have paid<br/>\nfor a fun program to help her to walk?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I ended up paying about $5. $20 for the 100 Easy Lessons which I<br/>\nsold last year for about $15. (And it didn&#39;t work either because my daughter<br/>\nhad 0 interest.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re really buying is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) a sense of peace that she&#39;ll learn to read. This is preying on groundless<br/>\nfears. As an unschooler in an environment where reading is naturally fun and<br/>\nuseful she *will* learn to read. It may be tomorrow. It may be 6 years from<br/>\nnow. (Unless you put her in school where life isn&#39;t natural and there are<br/>\nmajor road blocks to learning to read. (Like expecting her to do something<br/>\nshe isn&#39;t developmentally ready for yet.) So for parents with kids in school<br/>\nthe fears aren&#39;t quite so groundless.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) *Maybe* early reading. Maybe. Though I&#39;d be more inclined to believe the<br/>\nkids who read early with phonics programs are the ones who would have read<br/>\nearly to begin with. And though being able to read before school starts gets<br/>\ncheered, what does it really mean? No one can tell the difference between an<br/>\nadult who read at 3 and an adult who read at 7.

In (name your state), the<br/>\nfailure follows the national pattern. The school system is not doing its<br/>\njob. Taxpayers¹ money is being wasted while the children are being denied an<br/>\neducation. More money will not change it. Sending kids to suburban schools<br/>\nwon¹t change it because all the public schools in the state are run by the<br/>\nstate Department of Education by the same rules, methods and mandates and<br/>\nall offer the same poor quality schooling. It&#39;s bad by design.<br/>\n<br/>\n   The public schools are failing everywhere because they don¹t have<br/>\neffective programs; they have no standards and no goals; they use inferior<br/>\nmethods for instruction  (i.e., ³Whole Language² a proven failure instead of<br/>\nPhonics a proven success); their bad teachers are virtually impossible to<br/>\nfire thanks to the power of the teachers¹ union; the system has a captive<br/>\naudience of consumers instead of parents with choices. The situation allows<br/>\nthe schools to fail without losing any customers or funding. In fact, the<br/>\nworse the schools perform, the higher their funding gets. The Hartford CT<br/>\nschools prove that -- they are among the nation¹s worst, and yet their per<br/>\npupil cost is among the nation¹s highest.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Government school systems are bureaucratic monopolies with one constant<br/>\nobjective: to enlarge their budgets. Their structure and practices guarantee<br/>\npoor performance. There are no incentives to improve the schools; no rewards<br/>\nfor good teaching and no penalties for incompetence. The system can blame<br/>\nits customers and ³society² for its own failures -- that¹s convenient but<br/>\ndishonest -- while its cry remains, ³Give us more money.² Taxpayers are its<br/>\ncaptives; the children are its victims.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 22<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:29:27 -0400<br/>\n   From: Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: 2222 Thanks Joanna<br/>\n<br/>\non 8/9/02 9:46 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ideally we should get the money for our children that is being spent on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>other<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;citizens children,&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ned sez:<br/>\nYes, with this further thought: It&#39;s OUR money to start with.<br/>\nIdeally, we should (be allowed to) keep the money in the first place.

Ultimately, the only fair<br/>\nsolution is for all school funding to be supported by the parents who choose<br/>\nthem, with a variety of private scholarship methods to help needy families.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the government schools are getting more and more oppressive and<br/>\ndespotic, there is a balancing movement, such as homeschooling and a growth<br/>\nof private schooling, and growing awareness of the needs of growing<br/>\nchildren.

Well, so be it. I&#39;ll give it a<br/>\nshot.   (it will tie in, just wait)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bible tells the story of the evolution of man&#39;s perception of, and<br/>\nrelationship to, the supernatural -- god -- the &quot;greater force&quot; behind<br/>\nworldly things, and the spiritual life, so to speak. &quot;It&#39;s all in God&#39;s<br/>\nhands,&quot; as they(we)<br/>\n say.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly on, man desperately needed explanations for things that were, and<br/>\nstill often are, beyond our comprehension.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaced with often overwhelming natural forces, we imagine an all powerful<br/>\nspirit that controls the world, indeed, the universe, and in the process,<br/>\ncontrols our puny existence.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly &quot;gods&quot; were the very forces of nature...Zeus, Mars, etc. There were<br/>\ngraven images of animals, tree worshippers, sacrifices (murders) to show our<br/>\nfear of the forces of &quot;heaven.&quot; Kings became gods to their people.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans have, is seems, always had a need to ascribe anthropomorphic<br/>\nqualities and motives to the forces of nature and to the nether world and to<br/>\nthe firmament. Thus, some gave their god a male human form and placed &quot;him&quot;<br/>\nin the heavens. &quot;He&quot; was to be the good (god) guy who would protect them, if<br/>\nthey obeyed certain rules. And to explain all the &quot;bad&quot; stuff that happens,<br/>\nthey created another guy (bad guy) and he lived, they were sure, underneath<br/>\neverything.....in Hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this imagery has been incredibly useful for financial institutions such<br/>\nas churces. The threat of Hell and damnation, along with the promise of<br/>\nsomeday sitting on the knee of a benevolent &quot;creator&quot; comprise the twin<br/>\nenticements for supporting a huge corps of therapists called clergy. (Hmm,<br/>\nsounds like what the public schools do to create their brand of conformity,<br/>\n&quot;Sit still and be quiet, and you&#39;ll get As; but if you don&#39;t we&#39;ll drug you<br/>\ninto a stupor)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the Bible goes further, because man is still evolving. Man&#39;s view of<br/>\n&quot;god&quot; changed over the centuries to a more and more enlightened idea. That<br/>\nadvanced thinking is described in the New Testament. For my money, Jesus<br/>\n(and a few others, like Buddha) led the way out of the era of nature and<br/>\nanimal worship into an era in which god is seen simply as man&#39;s highest view<br/>\nof himself. Jesus called it Love. Christianity changed everything, or, as<br/>\nRen said,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; turn[ed} the status quo on it&#39;s head.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Religion has become a personal thing, instead of a group thing, even though<br/>\nmany people still enjoy group rituals and celebrations or their &quot;truth.&quot;<br/>\nThere&#39;s even a joke, &quot;Hey, I saw God, and she&#39;s black !&quot;  -- talk about<br/>\nupsetting the apple cart...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, today, we don&#39;t grovel in front of a carved statue of a beast, we don&#39;t<br/>\npray (beg) to an unknowable &quot;man&quot; in the sky, but we grow (if we can) in an<br/>\nunderstanding and demonstration of our own highest ethics and best<br/>\nattributes. If we read the Bible (which I used to but don&#39;t these days) we<br/>\nlearn that we are created in the image and likeness of God.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat &quot;good news&quot; (the meaning of &quot;gospel&#39;) that is!  If we can believe that,<br/>\nthen we know that we are not born as &quot;sinners,&quot; but with all the qualities<br/>\nwe need in order to perfect our lives. It means there is no need to beg for<br/>\nfavors, no need to pay for forgiveness, no need to believe that anyone or<br/>\nanything has power over us or is god&#39;s go-between. (Martin Luther drew that<br/>\nline in the sand for us, saying, in effect, that we could speak driectly to<br/>\ngod, if we wanted to. Wow, what a breakthrough)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have examples of people in several cultures coming to similar<br/>\nconclusions. Man has evolved much since the days of cow worship and man<br/>\nworship. Today, there need be no intermediary (priest) between man and<br/>\nwhatever we view as a creative/benevolent spirit, or god.<br/>\n<br/>\n The same evolution took place in nations...America was founded on the still<br/>\nrelatively new (in 1750) idea that the individual is more important than the<br/>\ngroup, and our government was viewed by the framers as the mechanism to<br/>\nprotect individual citizens from harm, whether from other individuals or<br/>\ngroups.  While government schooling is the last vestige of socialist ideas<br/>\n(top-down control, or subsumption of individuals to the group),<br/>\nhomeschooling is helping our country to overcome that oppression and evolve<br/>\nto a higher level of self- and universal awareness.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 24<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:29:27 -0400<br/>\n   From: Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: 2223 Separation of School and State<br/>\n<br/>\non 8/10/02 1:30 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt; Date: Fri, 09 Aug 2002 20:33:13 -0700<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Betsy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have it bookmarked, but there is a separation of schools and<br/>\n&gt; state website.....

Let me correct one thing, though.<br/>\n The Separation of School and State Alliance (www.sepschool.org) does not<br/>\nadvocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt advocates the elimination of FORCED FUNDING of schools by government. In<br/>\nother words, public schools, like all others, should continue to exist so<br/>\nlong as there are people who are willing to pay for them voluntarily. That<br/>\nwould mean, of course, that those schools are providing a service that lots<br/>\nof people actually want.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, there is in the ballpark of $400B annually spent on the public<br/>\nschools. If that amount was not forced to be paid by citizens to the one<br/>\npublic school system, it would remain in the hands of those citizens who<br/>\ncould spend it for any school they would choose for their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are dozens of private funding programs today that help families afford<br/>\nalternative schools for their kids. Many more such programs would exist if<br/>\nthe tax funding of schools ended. And with that, many new schools would open<br/>\nthat would satisfy the varied needs of our diverse population.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 25<br/>\n   Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:31:10 -0400<br/>\n   From: Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: 2223 -- YIKES! !<br/>\n<br/>\non 8/10/02 1:30 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are contemplating buying Hooked on Phonics for Brittany.

The ads make it look like it&#39;s fun for the kids.<br/>\n&gt;And it might be. But how much are you willing to spend on a fun way to do<br/>\n&gt;something that will happen naturally for free? How much would you have paid<br/>\n&gt;for a fun program to help her to walk?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think I ended up paying about $5. $20 for the 100 Easy Lessons which I<br/>\n&gt;sold last year for about $15. (And it didn&#39;t work either because my <br/>\n&gt;daughter<br/>\n&gt;had 0 interest.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What you&#39;re really buying is:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1) a sense of peace that she&#39;ll learn to read. This is preying on <br/>\n&gt;groundless<br/>\n&gt;fears. As an unschooler in an environment where reading is naturally fun <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;useful she *will* learn to read. It may be tomorrow. It may be 6 years from<br/>\n&gt;now. (Unless you put her in school where life isn&#39;t natural and there are<br/>\n&gt;major road blocks to learning to read. (Like expecting her to do something<br/>\n&gt;she isn&#39;t developmentally ready for yet.) So for parents with kids in <br/>\n&gt;school<br/>\n&gt;the fears aren&#39;t quite so groundless.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2) *Maybe* early reading. Maybe. Though I&#39;d be more inclined to believe the<br/>\n&gt;kids who read early with phonics programs are the ones who would have read<br/>\n&gt;early to begin with. And though being able to read before school starts <br/>\n&gt;gets<br/>\n&gt;cheered, what does it really mean? No one can tell the difference between <br/>\n&gt;an<br/>\n&gt;adult who read at 3 and an adult who read at 7. (I&#39;d extend that to 13 for<br/>\n&gt;an unschooler but a later reader in school might be demoralized by the<br/>\n&gt;intervention and end up not liking to read or be convinced he can&#39;t. Sandra<br/>\n&gt;has been collecting stories of later readers at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> I think the most important thing to realize <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;terms of calming fears is that a 13 yo new reader is *not* 7 years behind.<br/>\n&gt;They&#39;ll be indistinguishable from their peers pretty quickly.) Learning<br/>\n&gt;through reading is *different* not better than learning by doing or <br/>\n&gt;learning<br/>\n&gt;by watching. Unless you&#39;re in school where learning is *only* avialble<br/>\n&gt;through reading and listening. Then otherwise endowed kids are severly<br/>\n&gt;handicapped. That doesn&#39;t need to be true at home.

(And to make sure the<br/>\n&gt;seller has listed his item under the correct heading!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.addall.com\">http://www.addall.com</a> it will search 20 or so used book sites<br/>\n&gt;(including half.com).

On the other hand I have seen testimony by many,<br/>\n&gt;many families whose lives were ruined by social service agencies who<br/>\n&gt;tore them apart, ripped kids out of their parents home for no good<br/>\n&gt;reason by their own opinions and put them into foster homes where they<br/>\n&gt;were raped or abused and neglected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;BUt they change the name of their agency, rather than their<br/>\n&gt;fundamentally flawed premise, that the government by intruding and<br/>\n&gt;degrading the dignity and rights of its people can get them to &quot;act<br/>\n&gt;better&quot;. Do you advocate spanking and punishing your child and use<br/>\n&gt;threats of that to increase their judgment? It&#39;s just that the<br/>\n&gt;government finds it very difficult to control people in a positive way.<br/>\n&gt;I think that is what you are asking for. Punishment (though it has its<br/>\n&gt;place) does not control people - it smashes them. A better idea of WHAT<br/>\n&gt;to do for people and how to define roles, and helping people help<br/>\n&gt;themselves is what is needed. That is a slow hard way to go for it means<br/>\n&gt;one-on-one communication and understanding and if you don&#39;t really have<br/>\n&gt;any idea how to help someone, you don&#39;t conceive it is possible - but it<br/>\n&gt;is.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Debbie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So social services are part of what citizens and residents want.

I have not started any sort of<br/>\n&gt;school or unschool at home as yet, unless one counts summer and just trying<br/>\n&gt;to relax, but I am not sending my 12 year old back to public school this<br/>\n&gt;fall.  After years of arguing with his father,  I have finally succeeded in<br/>\n&gt;at least having him agree to let me try it at home.  (divorce in progress<br/>\n&gt;here)  Their father does not trust that I can handle the situation without <br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt;&quot;facilitator&quot; so I am probably going to sign up for a Charter School, and <br/>\n&gt;go<br/>\n&gt;from there, at least it is in a little different direction.  My son has<br/>\n&gt;largely lost the joy of learning,  although I see him doing things this<br/>\n&gt;summer that seem like learning to me...which I would never mention to him.<br/>\n&gt;He has never read for pleasure as a for instance.  Maybe that will come,<br/>\n&gt;maybe it won&#39;t.  I really believe he needs a large break.  I am hoping with<br/>\n&gt;this charter school that we may be able to choose a &quot;curriculum&quot; and do<br/>\n&gt;basically what we want, yet documenting it in a way that appears to follow<br/>\n&gt;said curriculum.<br/>\n&gt;I have two older sons who went through the PS  system.  My seventeen year <br/>\n&gt;old<br/>\n&gt;is doing fine by most people standards, my twenty year old really would <br/>\n&gt;have<br/>\n&gt;benefited from a completely different situation.  I am feeling very guilty<br/>\n&gt;for being so complacent for so many years.... and hope I can at least turn <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;youngest&#39;s life around.<br/>\n&gt;Ideally, I would like to do away with any kind of system at all.

The<br/>\n&gt;church I belong to does not have the same concept of Hell as most<br/>\n&gt;others. We don&#39;t believe in a literal firey pit. We do believe that<br/>\n&gt;all of the evil people will spend eternity with each other though,<br/>\n&gt;and never be around good people. I think that would be all the<br/>\n&gt;punishment neccessary. And by evil people, we don&#39;t mean people who<br/>\n&gt;believe differently than us, we mean really evil people like Hitler,<br/>\n&gt;child molestors, murders, etc. You know, people who, by just about<br/>\n&gt;any standard, would be considered evil.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-Suzanna<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 15<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 11:54:28 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: googling creation<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;HA!

Like everything else of course, this is not<br/>\n&gt;a rule, but a suggestion or guideline based on experience.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I am feeling very guilty for being so complacent for so many years.... <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;hope I can at least turn my youngest&#39;s life around.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While you all deschool, you can also work on forgiving yourself. Lots of us<br/>\n&gt;have felt the way you do. You&#39;ve done the best you could with the<br/>\n&gt;information you had. Now you have more information and you&#39;re making<br/>\n&gt;different choices for your youngest. Try not to let guilt get in the way of<br/>\n&gt;a joyful today.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Life is good.<br/>\n&gt;~Mary<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Join the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 18<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 14:39:32 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PSoroosh@...\">PSoroosh@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: school financing and economics debates<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;Parents -- not politicians or government employees -- should choose how<br/>\n&gt;their own money should be spent for their own children&#39;s education.<br/>\n&gt;Nobody has a right to anyone else&#39;s property.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ned --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You have apparently not read enough economics to have understood the <br/>\n&gt;concepts<br/>\n&gt;of public goods and positive/negative externalities and some of the causes<br/>\n&gt;and solutions to market failure.

In (name your state), <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;failure follows the national pattern. The school system is not doing its<br/>\n&gt;job. Taxpayers� money is being wasted while the children are being denied <br/>\n&gt;an<br/>\n&gt;education. More money will not change it. Sending kids to suburban schools<br/>\n&gt;won�t change it because all the public schools in the state are run by the<br/>\n&gt;state Department of Education by the same rules, methods and mandates and<br/>\n&gt;all offer the same poor quality schooling. It&#39;s bad by design.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    The public schools are failing everywhere because they don�t have<br/>\n&gt;effective programs; they have no standards and no goals; they use inferior<br/>\n&gt;methods for instruction  (i.e., �Whole Language� a proven failure instead <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;Phonics a proven success); their bad teachers are virtually impossible to<br/>\n&gt;fire thanks to the power of the teachers� union; the system has a captive<br/>\n&gt;audience of consumers instead of parents with choices. The situation allows<br/>\n&gt;the schools to fail without losing any customers or funding. In fact, the<br/>\n&gt;worse the schools perform, the higher their funding gets. The Hartford CT<br/>\n&gt;schools prove that -- they are among the nation�s worst, and yet their per<br/>\n&gt;pupil cost is among the nation�s highest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Government school systems are bureaucratic monopolies with one constant<br/>\n&gt;objective: to enlarge their budgets. Their structure and practices <br/>\n&gt;guarantee<br/>\n&gt;poor performance. There are no incentives to improve the schools; no <br/>\n&gt;rewards<br/>\n&gt;for good teaching and no penalties for incompetence. The system can blame<br/>\n&gt;its customers and �society� for its own failures -- that�s convenient but<br/>\n&gt;dishonest -- while its cry remains, �Give us more money.� Taxpayers are its<br/>\n&gt;captives; the children are its victims.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ned Vare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 22<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:29:27 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: 2222 Thanks Joanna<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;on 8/9/02 9:46 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Joanna writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ideally we should get the money for our children that is being spent on <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;citizens children,&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ned sez:<br/>\n&gt;Yes, with this further thought: It&#39;s OUR money to start with.<br/>\n&gt;Ideally, we should (be allowed to) keep the money in the first place.

Ultimately, the only fair<br/>\n&gt;solution is for all school funding to be supported by the parents who <br/>\n&gt;choose<br/>\n&gt;them, with a variety of private scholarship methods to help needy families.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While the government schools are getting more and more oppressive and<br/>\n&gt;despotic, there is a balancing movement, such as homeschooling and a growth<br/>\n&gt;of private schooling, and growing awareness of the needs of growing<br/>\n&gt;children.

Well, so be it. I&#39;ll give it a<br/>\n&gt;shot.   (it will tie in, just wait)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Bible tells the story of the evolution of man&#39;s perception of, and<br/>\n&gt;relationship to, the supernatural -- god -- the &quot;greater force&quot; behind<br/>\n&gt;worldly things, and the spiritual life, so to speak. &quot;It&#39;s all in God&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;hands,&quot; as they(we)<br/>\n&gt;  say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Early on, man desperately needed explanations for things that were, and<br/>\n&gt;still often are, beyond our comprehension.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Faced with often overwhelming natural forces, we imagine an all powerful<br/>\n&gt;spirit that controls the world, indeed, the universe, and in the process,<br/>\n&gt;controls our puny existence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Early &quot;gods&quot; were the very forces of nature...Zeus, Mars, etc. There were<br/>\n&gt;graven images of animals, tree worshippers, sacrifices (murders) to show <br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt;fear of the forces of &quot;heaven.&quot; Kings became gods to their people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Humans have, is seems, always had a need to ascribe anthropomorphic<br/>\n&gt;qualities and motives to the forces of nature and to the nether world and <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;the firmament. Thus, some gave their god a male human form and placed &quot;him&quot;<br/>\n&gt;in the heavens. &quot;He&quot; was to be the good (god) guy who would protect them, <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;they obeyed certain rules. And to explain all the &quot;bad&quot; stuff that happens,<br/>\n&gt;they created another guy (bad guy) and he lived, they were sure, underneath<br/>\n&gt;everything.....in Hell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All this imagery has been incredibly useful for financial institutions such<br/>\n&gt;as churces. The threat of Hell and damnation, along with the promise of<br/>\n&gt;someday sitting on the knee of a benevolent &quot;creator&quot; comprise the twin<br/>\n&gt;enticements for supporting a huge corps of therapists called clergy. (Hmm,<br/>\n&gt;sounds like what the public schools do to create their brand of conformity,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;Sit still and be quiet, and you&#39;ll get As; but if you don&#39;t we&#39;ll drug you<br/>\n&gt;into a stupor)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But the Bible goes further, because man is still evolving. Man&#39;s view of<br/>\n&gt;&quot;god&quot; changed over the centuries to a more and more enlightened idea. That<br/>\n&gt;advanced thinking is described in the New Testament. For my money, Jesus<br/>\n&gt;(and a few others, like Buddha) led the way out of the era of nature and<br/>\n&gt;animal worship into an era in which god is seen simply as man&#39;s highest <br/>\n&gt;view<br/>\n&gt;of himself. Jesus called it Love. Christianity changed everything, or, as<br/>\n&gt;Ren said,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; turn[ed} the status quo on it&#39;s head.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;Religion has become a personal thing, instead of a group thing, even though<br/>\n&gt;many people still enjoy group rituals and celebrations or their &quot;truth.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s even a joke, &quot;Hey, I saw God, and she&#39;s black !&quot;  -- talk about<br/>\n&gt;upsetting the apple cart...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, today, we don&#39;t grovel in front of a carved statue of a beast, we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;pray (beg) to an unknowable &quot;man&quot; in the sky, but we grow (if we can) in an<br/>\n&gt;understanding and demonstration of our own highest ethics and best<br/>\n&gt;attributes. If we read the Bible (which I used to but don&#39;t these days) we<br/>\n&gt;learn that we are created in the image and likeness of God.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;What &quot;good news&quot; (the meaning of &quot;gospel&#39;) that is!  If we can believe <br/>\n&gt;that,<br/>\n&gt;then we know that we are not born as &quot;sinners,&quot; but with all the qualities<br/>\n&gt;we need in order to perfect our lives. It means there is no need to beg for<br/>\n&gt;favors, no need to pay for forgiveness, no need to believe that anyone or<br/>\n&gt;anything has power over us or is god&#39;s go-between. (Martin Luther drew that<br/>\n&gt;line in the sand for us, saying, in effect, that we could speak driectly to<br/>\n&gt;god, if we wanted to. Wow, what a breakthrough)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We have examples of people in several cultures coming to similar<br/>\n&gt;conclusions. Man has evolved much since the days of cow worship and man<br/>\n&gt;worship. Today, there need be no intermediary (priest) between man and<br/>\n&gt;whatever we view as a creative/benevolent spirit, or god.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  The same evolution took place in nations...America was founded on the <br/>\n&gt;still<br/>\n&gt;relatively new (in 1750) idea that the individual is more important than <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;group, and our government was viewed by the framers as the mechanism to<br/>\n&gt;protect individual citizens from harm, whether from other individuals or<br/>\n&gt;groups.  While government schooling is the last vestige of socialist ideas<br/>\n&gt;(top-down control, or subsumption of individuals to the group),<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling is helping our country to overcome that oppression and evolve<br/>\n&gt;to a higher level of self- and universal awareness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ned Vare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:29:27 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: 2223 Separation of School and State<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;on 8/10/02 1:30 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Fri, 09 Aug 2002 20:33:13 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: Betsy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have it bookmarked, but there is a separation of schools and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; state website.....

Let me correct one thing, though.<br/>\n&gt;  The Separation of School and State Alliance (www.sepschool.org) does not<br/>\n&gt;advocate eliminating public schooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It advocates the elimination of FORCED FUNDING of schools by government. In<br/>\n&gt;other words, public schools, like all others, should continue to exist so<br/>\n&gt;long as there are people who are willing to pay for them voluntarily. That<br/>\n&gt;would mean, of course, that those schools are providing a service that lots<br/>\n&gt;of people actually want.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Today, there is in the ballpark of $400B annually spent on the public<br/>\n&gt;schools. If that amount was not forced to be paid by citizens to the one<br/>\n&gt;public school system, it would remain in the hands of those citizens who<br/>\n&gt;could spend it for any school they would choose for their kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are dozens of private funding programs today that help families <br/>\n&gt;afford<br/>\n&gt;alternative schools for their kids. Many more such programs would exist if<br/>\n&gt;the tax funding of schools ended. And with that, many new schools would <br/>\n&gt;open<br/>\n&gt;that would satisfy the varied needs of our diverse population.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ned Vare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ned Vare<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 25<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:31:10 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: 2223 -- YIKES! !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;on 8/10/02 1:30 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We are contemplating buying Hooked on Phonics for Brittany.
