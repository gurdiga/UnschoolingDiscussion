But what&#39;s the transistion from <br/>\nthat to taking responsibility for themselves?  This has become very <br/>\ncontentious for us.  If  Sam&#39;s grumpy and we suggest maybe he&#39;s hungry or <br/>\nthat he didn&#39;t eat anything very solid lately, he gets really mad.  How (what <br/>\nwords, tones, etc.) do people talk to kids about paying attention to their <br/>\nbody signals,  or their moods, or about nutrition in general?<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely know from my own experience that making certain foods taboo <br/>\nbackfires horribly.  And yet I get influenced by all those research finding <br/>\nabout exercise and nutrition that the S.F. Chronicle has on the front page at <br/>\nleast once a week (because they want to hide the corporate scandals on the <br/>\nthird page).  I also read &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; recently and have been on the <br/>\nrampage against foods containing added natural and artificial flavorings <br/>\nbecause I hate the idea of our taste buds being manipulated by chemical <br/>\nfactories in New Jersey.   Same with trans-fats.  So I talk about this to my <br/>\nkids (well, the older one) and  explain why I don&#39;t want to buy this stuff.  <br/>\nSo then of course I&#39;ve wound up depriving them and then they do binge on the <br/>\nM&Ms (peanut, so we can&#39;t blame the lack of protein!) that I bought because <br/>\nafter all that talk about M&Ms, even with diarrhea talk added, I wanted some! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I don&#39;t know.  I feel confused.  I really understand the point that <br/>\ndeprivation and labeling things &quot;junk&quot; can make all of us desire them more <br/>\nand turn the joy of those things to guilt.  I also think that some foods are <br/>\nhealthier for us than others.  Should I ever communicate that to my kids?  <br/>\nMaybe I should say, have I totally blown it in having communicated that <br/>\nbelief to my kids, since I already have?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never said anything to my oldest about nutrition until he was about six, <br/>\njust bought my usual mix of lots of fresh and relatively unprocessed foods <br/>\nalong with sweets.  I very distinctly remember going out to lunch with three <br/>\nother families who had rules about eating so many bites of this before you <br/>\nwere done and sweets only on treat day and dessert after half the sandwich.  <br/>\nI had no rules.  I bought him what he wanted.  The cookie was next to the <br/>\npasta salad and whatever else there was.  My friends all looked at their kids <br/>\nbalking at their lunches and looked at Sam and said, &quot;Sam&#39;s the only one <br/>\neating without complaining.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t have rules.  But I fear I&#39;ve done as much damage in talking <br/>\nabout this being less nutritious than that as my friends did in having all <br/>\nthose rules.
