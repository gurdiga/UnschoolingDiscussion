Hope and Asia are in their room, playing with a Littlest Pet <br/>\nShop set, which their dad found on clearance at a drug store right <br/>\nafter Christmas, and bought because he remembered them mentioning that <br/>\nthey thought it was cute one time.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now Brenna is playing tug of war with our chihuahua and talking to me <br/>\nabout the weather, because she&#39;s considering getting dressed and wanted <br/>\nto know what sort of thing to wear.<br/>\n<br/>\n None of us have bothered to get dressed, yet, but we&#39;re thinking about <br/>\nit ;-).
