Sometimes, I am faking, but usually only a <br/>\nlittle and only for the beginning, because I can&#39;t fool my children.  <br/>\nThere are loads of things that I put out that they don&#39;t care for, <br/>\nand I have to be a little thick-skinned about that, too, if *my* <br/>\nenthusiasm was real.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Do your kids help you clean up after playing with all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that? ***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  They are 8 and 3, and they don&#39;t help.  Actually, since my 3 <br/>\ny.o. is a neat child by nature, he is more helpful than my 8 y.o., <br/>\nbut it is three year old help &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house is usually messy, since I am not as organized as I&#39;d like. I <br/>\nactually have found flylady.net to be helpful with getting organized <br/>\nand keeping house.  Since I was raised to be a career/thinking woman, <br/>\nby a thinking/career woman who didn&#39;t value home making, I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to clean or when or why or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, I do lose it and tell them I need some help because <br/>\nthe &quot;stuff&quot; everywhere is geting to me.  Sometimes I just tell my <br/>\nhusband this.  But those occurances are rare.  Mostly, we live in <br/>\nhouse that looks like there are two active kids and dog and a cat and <br/>\na turtle and a fish and a mom and a dad and friends and family who <br/>\neat and create and play and live.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to see the Joy of projects as a gift for my children, with no <br/>\nstrings attached.<br/>\n<br/>\n***What do you think is enough? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, this varies day to day.  I will say, tho, that in the <br/>\nbeginning, it was most of the time my children were awake.  My <br/>\nchildren really tested whether it was true that were going to play <br/>\ntogether.  But, also, my kids will only spend 1/2 hour or so on any <br/>\none thing.  My daughter would be with me 24/7~never be alone playing, <br/>\nliterally.  Since she learned to tell time, this has been easier, <br/>\nbecause I will say, &quot;After 15 minutes to check my email, I will get <br/>\nout the sewing stuff&quot; or &quot;At 1 o&#39;clock, I&#39;ll try to give your brother <br/>\na nap, can we (do whatever) then when we have some time together?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***Can you give me an idea of how much time you spend?***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter likes to play Barbies.  I didn&#39;t even have any growing <br/>\nup, they don&#39;t interest me, and when I do play with them I am  <br/>\nridiculous in my play to keep myself entertained (for instance, <br/>\nBarbie leaves Ken to start an anarchist revolution that frees all the <br/>\nlittle Barbies, whatever they are called :D).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t work for my daughter, who is much more traditional in <br/>\nher story-telling. &lt;g&gt;. I told her that I love to *hear* her stories <br/>\nwith Barbie (which I *DO*), so most of the time, I will lie on her <br/>\nbed (yay!) or put away laundry in her room (less yay~but still good!) <br/>\nwhile she plays and tells her stories.  Sometimes, I can even go in <br/>\nto the bathroom across the hall and clean it while I am listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason, my kids don&#39;t see book reading as making me as <br/>\nunavailable to them as the computer, and I can bring a book into <br/>\nwhere they are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents I know listen to a music tape on head phones while <br/>\nsitting on the couch reading while their kids watch tv.  I can&#39;t have <br/>\nthat much input going on around me, but it might work for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that the beginning of the day connection is the most <br/>\nimnportant one for us.  If I really fully give time then, I can <br/>\nbe &quot;freed&quot; up a little later on. <br/>\n<br/>\n***What happens when your own soul hasn&#39;t been<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; replenished and you&#39;ve got nothing left to give?***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a real problem.  I am constantly trying to find this balance <br/>\nfor myself.  Last night~from 8:30-closing, I went to Borders <br/>\nBookstore (they are open until 10) with another mom and her <br/>\ndaughter.  The kids played and we chatted.  It was great, and the <br/>\nother mom&#39;s idea, but I think I will suggest it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I fully commit to replenshing my own self, it doesn&#39;t take much <br/>\ntime or money.  If I am snatching time at the computer or on the <br/>\nphone, or whatever, it doesn&#39;t work as well, and can waste hours. But <br/>\nif I say to my husband, I am taking a bath, and go alone and sit in <br/>\nhot water, I can feel better in minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to go to the bookstore alone, too, in the evening for a hour <br/>\nand look at a huge stack of books (landscaping books are calling me <br/>\nlately) and drink a &quot;special&quot; coffee drink.  I have only done that <br/>\ntwice in the last four months, but it was great, inexpensive, and I <br/>\nknow I *could* do it again if I needed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m happy to announce to you all that I&#39;ve been<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; watching some T.V. with them, including Cyberchase and<br/>\n&gt; talking with them about it. ***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yippee! Hooray!  You might even find you start to like some of this <br/>\nstuff!!<br/>\n<br/>\n***Does it count if I bring<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; carrots to peel with me etc... to do while I watch?***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think so.  When we go out somewhere, especially with other <br/>\nfamilies, or when we are home for a while and into our own things (my <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s on the computer and I am reading, for example). I check in <br/>\na lot.  I learned this from Anne Ohman, but I pat my children, touch <br/>\ntheir shoulders, kiss their heads, and tell them I love them.  It <br/>\nconnects us even when we are persuing separate agendas.  Sometimes, <br/>\nit feels a little contrived, but it is becoming a habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend _The Intentional Family_ by William Doherty, as it <br/>\nis mostly about creating rituals to connect the family, although <br/>\nmaybe I should read it again with unschooly eyes before I recommend <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise, I think that you are being very brave to ask all these <br/>\nquestions and take some seriously critical responses and keep digging <br/>\ndeeper.

This seems like a lot of time<br/>\n&gt; that you are on the computer, away from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mind sharing with me how much time you spend on<br/>\nthe computer each day? I am wondering how to fit all<br/>\nthis in and think that the only thing that can give is<br/>\ncomputer time, but I&#39;m not sure what to cut out! I&#39;ll<br/>\ndo it though, for my kids!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you work with the door open?  Can the computer<br/>\n&gt; be<br/>\n&gt; in the main part of the house?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t actually, I believe I have ADD. I was never<br/>\ndiagnosed, but I&#39;ve got some typical symptoms, like<br/>\nthe inability to focus when there is background noise.<br/>\nThat&#39;s why the door is closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much time do you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; really NEED each day on the computer? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know really, what is a reasonable, healthy<br/>\namount of time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not like a girlfriend of yours who might invite<br/>\n&gt; you to a play that you might think would be boring<br/>\n&gt; so<br/>\n&gt; you decline the invitation...these are your<br/>\n&gt; children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Point taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m not saying that every minute needs to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; be together,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How much time do you feel I should spend with the kids<br/>\neach day on average to make unschooling an option for<br/>\nus?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems to me that you might be viewing unschooling<br/>\n&gt; soley as child-led.  While aspects of unschooling<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; child-led, I really don&#39;t prefer that term, because<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; makes it appear that unschooling is only about the<br/>\n&gt; child coming to you, the child coming up with all<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; ideas.  It&#39;s not just them coming to you, it&#39;s also<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You hit the nail on the head! That&#39;s what I thought<br/>\nunschooling was. Waiting until my kids come to me and<br/>\nask specifically for what they want me to do and meet<br/>\nthose needs as best I can. Is that not right!? It<br/>\ncertainly hasn&#39;t been working for us!  Wow, I can see<br/>\nwhy my daughter wants to go back to school! So I&#39;ll<br/>\nwork on this!<br/>\n<br/>\n Have you ever heard someone say<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that parents who unschool are &quot;tour guides&quot;, rather<br/>\n&gt; than teachers.  Are you being a good tour guide? <br/>\n&gt; Are<br/>\n&gt; you providing them everything they need to live a<br/>\n&gt; rich, exciting, fullfilling life?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No I hadn&#39;t heard the &quot;tour Guide&quot; analogy, thanks,<br/>\nthat helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You tell us, are you providing enough other<br/>\n&gt; alternatives?  Is there plenty of books, toys,<br/>\n&gt; puzzles, games, arts &#39;n&#39; craft materials, coloring<br/>\n&gt; books, outdoor items, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, so I guess I&#39;ll do the rounds at the thrift<br/>\nstores, but I hate shopping at thrift stores!!!<br/>\n(Actually I hate shopping period!)<br/>\nI know I know, it&#39;s not about ME, it&#39;s for the kids!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n I think you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are<br/>\n&gt; on your way to getting it right, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut that you might<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; need to learn more about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, and I&#39;ve gotten a bunch of good links to do<br/>\nthis, but I am trying to spend LESS time on line,<br/>\nso...???<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Have you read about strewing? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>O.K.

He was<br/>\nworking 7 days a week for a while, 3 days at 14 hour<br/>\nshift (2 diff. jobs) so the only way I could take care<br/>\nof me and nurture myself was to do it with the kids<br/>\naround. Not having ANY free time until they are older<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sounf healthy to me, are you sure? I tend to<br/>\njust get grumpier and grumpier until I get a break,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t everyone need a break form being with other<br/>\npeople, kids or adults? I consider myself to be very<br/>\nsocial, but even I need breaks!<br/>\nNow that my husband has a more normal schedule, I<br/>\nexpect to not need so much &quot;free time&quot; while the kids<br/>\nare around.<br/>\nAlso, I notice that if I don&#39;t get a certain amount of<br/>\ntime to myself to pursue my interests, I suffer from<br/>\ninsomnia. I lay in bed for hours thinking about what I<br/>\nwant to do, or I get up and write or read or get on<br/>\nthe computer and accomplish some of the stuff. But if<br/>\nI don&#39;t do this, I still don&#39;t get to sleep until 3, 4<br/>\nor sometimes even 5am!<br/>\n<br/>\n But the goal of unschooling<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is not to find<br/>\n&gt; convenient free time for mom.  So maybe you need to<br/>\n&gt; reassess your<br/>\n&gt; priorities and think about whether unschooling is a<br/>\n&gt; deeply held<br/>\n&gt; belief/philosophy for you or just why you chose this<br/>\n&gt; path. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I chose this path because I believe it is the best way<br/>\nto learn! I want the best for my kids as do we all,<br/>\nand I truly believe that their needs are not met by<br/>\nschools, especially public schools and when i tried<br/>\ndoing school-at-home it was a complete and utter<br/>\nfailure! Then I discovered unschooling, but even that<br/>\nisn&#39;t quite working. I am lost and confused! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your priority is to find<br/>\n&gt; free time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, you&#39;re right, my priority is my kids, but how to<br/>\nput that into practice? It&#39;s easier said than done.<br/>\nBut I want concrete suggestions on how to do it. I&#39;ll<br/>\ntry waht you guys suggest!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Successful unschooling and a strong relationship<br/>\n&gt; with your kids will<br/>\n&gt; absolutely require you to be interested in what<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re doing.  You don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to like cyberchase but you can watch with them<br/>\n&gt; and talk to them and<br/>\n&gt; discover why *they* like cyberchase.  That&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; important thing here. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, I&#39;ve started doing that, thank you for the<br/>\nsuggestion!<br/>\nMore suggestions are welcome and needed!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One possible step toward finding shows you all enjoy<br/>\n&gt; would be more<br/>\n&gt; options.  If you&#39;re limiting their options on<br/>\n&gt; purpose I don&#39;t think you<br/>\n&gt; should complain that you don&#39;t enjoy the shows<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re choosing. &lt;g&gt;   I<br/>\n&gt; recommend getting more channels and then maybe<br/>\n&gt; another TV so that even<br/>\n&gt; more options are available to all of you.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have cable for 2 reasons:<br/>\n1. to save money<br/>\n2. We have noticed a direct corralation between the<br/>\nviolence on the shows that my son (5 yo) watches and<br/>\nthe violence he uses to vent his frustrations. So<br/>\nafter trying the radical unschooling idea of letting<br/>\nthem chose thir own shows for about 2 years, we<br/>\nfinally gave that up and started limiting what he<br/>\ncould watch.<br/>\nWe do however have a pass at blockbuster and get a lot<br/>\nof videos.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You are blocking your children out.  Are you<br/>\n&gt; depressed? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interesting that you ask this!<br/>\nYes, I do suffer on and off with depression and have<br/>\nfor years. I was on medication for years, I have<br/>\nreceived and continue to receive counseling, have made<br/>\nhuge changes in my diet to improve this, but still<br/>\noccasionally get really depressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Are you in a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rut?   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well that too! I&#39;ve had a lot of health challenges for<br/>\nthe past 2-3 years, my father died of cancer a year<br/>\nago this month and I&#39;ve been close to a divorce<br/>\nseveral times in the past couple years, but continue<br/>\nto take steps to try to save my marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to be with them.  Children run<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; around and play loudly,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what they do.  What&#39;s stopping you from<br/>\n&gt; playing with them?   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a condition with my ears called Hyperacusis<br/>\nwhich is abnormal sensitivity to everyday sound levels<br/>\nor noises, I am especially very sensitivity to high<br/>\npitched sounds. But your bringing this up has<br/>\nmotivated me to look into this further to see if it<br/>\ncan be treated. When I was diagnosed with it, the<br/>\ndoctor said there wasn&#39;t anything that could be done,<br/>\nbut my faith in doctors is very shaky, so I will do<br/>\nsome research to see if there is a treatment!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like<br/>\n&gt; to, but when I do, I am<br/>\n&gt; easily <br/>\n&gt; bored by what they do,***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Do you need a list of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fun things to offer<br/>\n&gt; and do with your kids?  People here could brainstorm<br/>\n&gt; for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, yes yes! Please, could you all throw out<br/>\nsuggestions? I would LOVE that! I promise to try them!<br/>\nYou won&#39;t be wasting your time!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the great Yoda says &quot;Do or do not,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there is no try.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, but did Yoda have kids??? ;oD Just kidding, I<br/>\nknow what you&#39;re saying, but the best I can manage<br/>\nright now is to do less and less yelling and hope it<br/>\nwill eventually be easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some constructive talk might be ok as long as<br/>\n&gt; constructive talk isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; code for lecturing. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, not lecturing, we are learning Nonviolent<br/>\nCommunication!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It sounds like you are disconnected from your kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I am! How do I reconnect with them before it&#39;s<br/>\ntoo late? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They&#39;re asking you for help and you&#39;re refusing.  <br/>\n&gt; What are you there<br/>\n&gt; for?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>O.K. the next time they say they are bored, I&#39;ll<br/>\nsurprise the hell out of them because I&#39;ll say &quot;O.K.<br/>\nlet&#39;s find something to do together!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously.  Anyone could come into your house<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and cook and clean,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But nobody does!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so why are *you* there? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes I wonder that myself! It contributes to my<br/>\ndepression. I feel useless, easily replaced by someone<br/>\nwho could do a much better job than me. I sometimes<br/>\nwonder if my family would do better without me. But<br/>\nthen I remember that  if I wasn&#39;t around, my husband<br/>\nwould have the kids in public school so fast their<br/>\nheads would be spinning and their souls certainly<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be fed there! So I&#39; here!!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For unschooling to be successful you will need to be<br/>\n&gt; involved with your<br/>\n&gt; children.  That means helping them live and play<br/>\n&gt; happily, helping them<br/>\n&gt; find things they love, helping them solve problems. <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I was wondering if I might be doing it wrong!<br/>\n:o)<br/>\nHence my e-mail to you guys, asking for help.<br/>\nSo here is the beginning of the attempt to do it<br/>\nright!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you went to your partner and said you were bored<br/>\n&gt; how would you feel if<br/>\n&gt; your partner said, essentially, &quot;go away and be<br/>\n&gt; bored somewhere else.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well that happens actually, I think he&#39;d rather do<br/>\nstuff with the kids than spend time with me, but we&#39;re<br/>\nworking on that one...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How many times could someone you love do that to you<br/>\n&gt; before you started<br/>\n&gt; to feel like you weren&#39;t important to them at all?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I see what you mean!<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ***So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much<br/>\n&gt; learning.***<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Play games.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for the long list of suggestions of things<br/>\nto do, I will do some. Am I not a good candidate for<br/>\nhomeschooling if I rarely enjoy these things? I think<br/>\nI would like them if there was another adult doing<br/>\nthem with me, but that is a problem in my life, always<br/>\nneeding other adults around, not really being with my<br/>\nkids. I&#39;m wondering if they would actually be better<br/>\noff in school?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any time you have to respond to some of my<br/>\nquestions, I really appreciate the thought provoking!<br/>\nI am doing some deep deep self examining here.<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

What if I don&#39;t feel that?<br/>\nShould I just do it anyway? Will it just happen<br/>\neventually? Do you think I shouldn&#39;t homeschool if I<br/>\ncan&#39;t feel that kind of enthusiasm?

I can barely do the regular housekeeping (and<br/>\nwhat I do have time to do housekeeping-wise is very<br/>\nminimal!) and whenever we do an art project, I can&#39;t<br/>\nget the kids to help clean up. I&#39;ve explained to them<br/>\nthat we would do more of this sort of thing if we<br/>\ncould clean up together, as a team, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to motivate them.

Or does that<br/>\nnot even begin to be enough? 3 hours? more?<br/>\nCan you give me an idea of how much time you spend?<br/>\nWhat happens when your own soul hasn&#39;t been<br/>\nreplenished and you&#39;ve got nothing left to give?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, lastly, I *do* watch Cyberchase<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m happy to announce to you all that I&#39;ve been<br/>\nwatching some T.V. with them, including Cyberchase and<br/>\ntalking with them about it. Does it count if I bring<br/>\ncarrots to peel with me etc... to do while I watch?<br/>\nAlso, I played with them with a huge box of popscicle<br/>\nsticks for a while and they had a blast with that.

But the goal of unschooling<br/>\n&gt; is not to find<br/>\n&gt; convenient free time for mom.  So maybe you need to<br/>\n&gt; reassess your<br/>\n&gt; priorities and think about whether unschooling is a<br/>\n&gt; deeply held<br/>\n&gt; belief/philosophy for you or just why you chose this<br/>\n&gt; path. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you have a like minded partner maybe your best<br/>\n&gt; hope for finding some<br/>\n&gt; free time at this stage in your kids lives would be<br/>\n&gt; those times when your<br/>\n&gt; partner can devote attention to the kids.   You<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t ever get these same<br/>\n&gt; kids at this same age again and if your priority is<br/>\n&gt; finding time for<br/>\n&gt; yourself you&#39;ll be missing the joy of five and nine<br/>\n&gt; year olds and you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; be cheating your kids.  I don&#39;t actually believe<br/>\n&gt; your priority is to find<br/>\n&gt; free time.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***I rarely watch T.V. with the kids. They mostly<br/>\n&gt; watch videos which<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t interest <br/>\n&gt; me at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS<br/>\n&gt; because we don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cable and either the shows interest them and not<br/>\n&gt; me***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Successful unschooling and a strong relationship<br/>\n&gt; with your kids will<br/>\n&gt; absolutely require you to be interested in what<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re doing.  You don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to like cyberchase but you can watch with them<br/>\n&gt; and talk to them and<br/>\n&gt; discover why *they* like cyberchase.  That&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; important thing here. <br/>\n&gt; Not that *you* like their programs but that you like<br/>\n&gt; to be with your<br/>\n&gt; kids, that you like to see their enthusiasm and<br/>\n&gt; enjoyment. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One possible step toward finding shows you all enjoy<br/>\n&gt; would be more<br/>\n&gt; options.  If you&#39;re limiting their options on<br/>\n&gt; purpose I don&#39;t think you<br/>\n&gt; should complain that you don&#39;t enjoy the shows<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re choosing. &lt;g&gt;   I<br/>\n&gt; recommend getting more channels and then maybe<br/>\n&gt; another TV so that even<br/>\n&gt; more options are available to all of you.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***I usually 99% of the time opt to get on the<br/>\n&gt; computer in my room, with<br/>\n&gt; the door closed.***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are blocking your children out.  Are you<br/>\n&gt; depressed?  Are you in a<br/>\n&gt; rut?   You need to be with them.  Children run<br/>\n&gt; around and play loudly,<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what they do.  What&#39;s stopping you from<br/>\n&gt; playing with them?   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like<br/>\n&gt; to, but when I do, I am<br/>\n&gt; easily <br/>\n&gt; bored by what they do,***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get over it.  I know that sounds harsh but your<br/>\n&gt; children need you to be<br/>\n&gt; involved with them.  You can suggest games and shows<br/>\n&gt; you might all enjoy.<br/>\n&gt;  You can bake cookies, have a mashed potato fight,<br/>\n&gt; have a water balloon<br/>\n&gt; fight, paint the sidewalk.   Do you need a list of<br/>\n&gt; fun things to offer<br/>\n&gt; and do with your kids?  People here could brainstorm<br/>\n&gt; for you. <br/>\n&gt; But you should be interacting with them when they<br/>\n&gt; are doing the things<br/>\n&gt; they enjoy.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***or I am yelling at them to stop fighting (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; working on <br/>\n&gt; the yelling issue, so more and more, I&#39;m talking to<br/>\n&gt; them constructively<br/>\n&gt; about <br/>\n&gt; they disputes!)***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s good that your working on the yelling.  I<br/>\n&gt; recommend you stop yelling<br/>\n&gt; at once. &lt;g&gt;  As the great Yoda says &quot;Do or do not,<br/>\n&gt; there is no try.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some constructive talk might be ok as long as<br/>\n&gt; constructive talk isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; code for lecturing.  But at five and nine they need<br/>\n&gt; you mostly to fix the<br/>\n&gt; problem.  What are the usual problems between them? <br/>\n&gt; Is one invading the<br/>\n&gt; space of the other?  What is going on with them? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***when I try to discuss stuff that&#39;s interesting to<br/>\n&gt; me, they are <br/>\n&gt; bored with that! ***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are they mirroring your boredom with their shows and<br/>\n&gt; games?   I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think you can expect them to show an interest in<br/>\n&gt; what you&#39;re doing and in<br/>\n&gt; what you enjoy if you are not showing an interest in<br/>\n&gt; their activities. <br/>\n&gt; You need to be an interested person for others to be<br/>\n&gt; interested in you.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It sounds like you are disconnected from your kids. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***If they come to me saying they are bored, which<br/>\n&gt; often happens on the<br/>\n&gt; day we <br/>\n&gt; stay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it<br/>\n&gt; helps you to be<br/>\n&gt; creative <br/>\n&gt; and I send them off to be bored elsewhere, so I can<br/>\n&gt; get some work<br/>\n&gt; done.***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;re asking you for help and you&#39;re refusing.  <br/>\n&gt; What are you there<br/>\n&gt; for?  Seriously.  Anyone could come into your house<br/>\n&gt; and cook and clean,<br/>\n&gt; so why are *you* there? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For unschooling to be successful you will need to be<br/>\n&gt; involved with your<br/>\n&gt; children.  That means helping them live and play<br/>\n&gt; happily, helping them<br/>\n&gt; find things they love, helping them solve problems. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you went to your partner and said you were bored<br/>\n&gt; how would you feel if<br/>\n&gt; your partner said, essentially, &quot;go away and be<br/>\n&gt; bored somewhere else.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; How many times could someone you love do that to you<br/>\n&gt; before you started<br/>\n&gt; to feel like you weren&#39;t important to them at all?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much<br/>\n&gt; learning.***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t try to get your kids to do things they are not<br/>\n&gt; interested in.  If<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t like the library don&#39;t offer to take them<br/>\n&gt; there.   (Library&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; have more than books though.  They have music,<br/>\n&gt; videos, audio books)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Go to the park, take a lunch, take a kite, a ball, a<br/>\n&gt; Frisbee.   Go for a<br/>\n&gt; walk, collect leaves, rocks, bugs.  Go for a hike,<br/>\n&gt; take food, ford<br/>\n&gt; streams, catch frogs, take pictures.   Go to the<br/>\n&gt; pool, take water toys,<br/>\n&gt; play.  Get squirt guns and blast each other.  Make<br/>\n&gt; up a wavy dance or a<br/>\n&gt; swishy dance or a &quot;bees are stinging my butt&quot; dance.<br/>\n&gt;  Play games.  Some<br/>\n&gt; games that can be played with little kids are: <br/>\n&gt; Mancalla, Set, Racko,<br/>\n&gt; Target, Five Crowns, Checkers, Clue, Tic Tac Toe,<br/>\n&gt; Life, Survival or<br/>\n&gt; Extinction (dinosaur game) Chinese Checkers, Flinch,<br/>\n&gt; Sorry.   Play Mad<br/>\n&gt; Libs, ask your kids for silly word and then read<br/>\n&gt; them the resulting<br/>\n&gt; story.    Have &quot;Monster Movie Night&quot; rent old<br/>\n&gt; monster movies and make<br/>\n&gt; popcorn and stomp around like Godzilla.   Go out for<br/>\n&gt; french fries.  Go<br/>\n&gt; out for ice cream.  Run races, ride bikes, go<br/>\n&gt; sledding, ice skating,<br/>\n&gt; roller skating.  Go play miniature golf.  Go<br/>\n&gt; bowling. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDenise <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease visit Symphony Sam, an exciting upcoming TV show for children about Classical Music that we are creating:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmusic.org/SymphonySam\">http://www.hotmusic.org/SymphonySam</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

This seems like a lot of time<br/>\nthat you are on the computer, away from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you work with the door open?  Can the computer be<br/>\nin the main part of the house?

If is kid type<br/>\nstuff, try even more ideas.  Pay attention to your<br/>\nchildren to REALLY get to know them, so that your<br/>\nideas will be more likely to click with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you own interests?  It&#39;s good to share your<br/>\nown interest with them and just because you are<br/>\nunschooling doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have things that<br/>\nyou enjoy.  Here is a great article about how a mom<br/>\nshares her interests with her kids:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strew/ren\">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ren</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So we usually go our own ways, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a very HANDS ON approach to living.  To<br/>\nunschool, you must be actively engaged with your<br/>\nchildren.  I&#39;m not saying that every minute needs to<br/>\nbe together, but the fact that your family usually<br/>\ngoes their own way and your children are so young<br/>\nstill tells me that something might be missing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much<br/>\n&gt; learning. I do interact with them <br/>\n&gt; when they come to me, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It seems to me that you might be viewing unschooling<br/>\nsoley as child-led.  While aspects of unschooling are<br/>\nchild-led, I really don&#39;t prefer that term, because it<br/>\nmakes it appear that unschooling is only about the<br/>\nchild coming to you, the child coming up with all the<br/>\nideas.  It&#39;s not just them coming to you, it&#39;s also<br/>\nyou going to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good that you interact with them, but you need to<br/>\ninteract even more.  Have you ever heard someone say<br/>\nthat parents who unschool are &quot;tour guides&quot;, rather<br/>\nthan teachers.  Are you being a good tour guide?  Are<br/>\nyou providing them everything they need to live a<br/>\nrich, exciting, fullfilling life?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I let them watch videos for hours,<br/>\n&gt; play video games for hours <br/>\n&gt; too, as long as they want, but am I providing enough<br/>\n&gt; interesting alternatives <br/>\n&gt; for them? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, letting them play video games and watch their<br/>\nvideos as much as they like is wonderful.  BUT, if a<br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t have enough other choices and a parent<br/>\nwho doesn&#39;t keep things interesting and fun, then that<br/>\ncan be all that they will do, because they don&#39;t have<br/>\nother options.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou tell us, are you providing enough other<br/>\nalternatives?  Is there plenty of books, toys,<br/>\npuzzles, games, arts &#39;n&#39; craft materials, coloring<br/>\nbooks, outdoor items, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy reading your post, I will say that I think there is<br/>\nroom for improvement on your part.  I think you could<br/>\nbe more involved with them.  But I also think that you<br/>\nknow that (by the tone of your post).  I think you are<br/>\non your way to getting it right, but that you might<br/>\nneed to learn more about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read about strewing?

They love <br/>\n&gt; each other and have a wonderful relationship, but<br/>\n&gt; they are not really <br/>\n&gt; playmates for eachother right now at their life<br/>\n&gt; stages.  It is <br/>\n&gt; extremely important to me that they have a<br/>\n&gt; respectful relationship,a <br/>\n&gt; nd that means that I am involved in a lot of their<br/>\n&gt; playing.  I could <br/>\n&gt; not have a closed door in my house with me on one<br/>\n&gt; side and them on <br/>\n&gt; the other and not have a fight erupt after about 30<br/>\n&gt; minutes.

Today is going to be the best day ever!<br/>\n&gt; Let&#39;s_____! <br/>\n&gt; (sometimes, it is stay in our pjs and watch<br/>\n&gt; Hamtaro!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t sugar coat it, more often than not my<br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm is met with <br/>\n&gt; rolling eyes from my tween :).  But, she does join<br/>\n&gt; in, and begins to <br/>\n&gt; laugh and be connected.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My dd, especially, feels disconnected from me when<br/>\n&gt; she watches more <br/>\n&gt; than a hour of tv at a time.  My ds won&#39;t eat<br/>\n&gt; breakfast unless he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; sitting in front of the tv.  So, I started leaving<br/>\n&gt; fun things in the <br/>\n&gt; kitchen for when they wake up.  Sometimes it is<br/>\n&gt; coloring pages and <br/>\n&gt; some cool markers, sometimes a big bowl of rice<br/>\n&gt; mixed with glitter, <br/>\n&gt; or shells, or a cool book, or some neat fabric. <br/>\n&gt; That way we have <br/>\n&gt; something to talk about while the coffee kicks in<br/>\n&gt; for me, and that <br/>\n&gt; may be something that they are drawn to that<br/>\n&gt; connects us together as <br/>\n&gt; a family before we turn to the screens in our lives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have no limits on tv and computer, but I do help<br/>\n&gt; my kids (since <br/>\n&gt; they are so young and my dd is not Always Unschooled<br/>\n&gt; and has a harder <br/>\n&gt; time with this than my always unschooled son).  I<br/>\n&gt; make sure that they <br/>\n&gt; have had *enough* of other things in their lives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Did they feed their souls some natural beauty?  Did<br/>\n&gt; their love of <br/>\n&gt; books and art get fed today(and my kids DO happen to<br/>\n&gt; love books and <br/>\n&gt; drawing~for you it may be legos or anime or video<br/>\n&gt; games)?  Where is <br/>\n&gt; the balance in our lives?  Do they need balance<br/>\n&gt; today, or is today <br/>\n&gt; just a computer game all day kind of day or read all<br/>\n&gt; day or park all <br/>\n&gt; day?  Sometimes an imbalance is okay, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And, lastly, I *do* watch Cyberchase, Foster&#39;s Home<br/>\n&gt; for Imaginary <br/>\n&gt; Friends and Spiderman, because there is ***so<br/>\n&gt; much*** that my <br/>\n&gt; children get out of those shows.  We raced home<br/>\n&gt; yesterday from the <br/>\n&gt; park to catch a show, and watched it togther.  No,<br/>\n&gt; it is not <br/>\n&gt; something I would choose to watch (I am more of a<br/>\n&gt; Lifetime Channel <br/>\n&gt; movie gal myself), but for me, unschooling is all<br/>\n&gt; about CONNECTIONS.  <br/>\n&gt; If you aren&#39;t connected to what your children are<br/>\n&gt; doing, you can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; expand those connections with things that will be<br/>\n&gt; meaningful to them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes, you have to give first.  If you want them<br/>\n&gt; to get up <br/>\n&gt; earlier to participate in some thins that you think<br/>\n&gt; might interest <br/>\n&gt; them, you have to show that you know and care about<br/>\n&gt; what interests <br/>\n&gt; them now.  If you are bored by their playing, and<br/>\n&gt; they know it, they <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t trust that you know what is fun in the outside<br/>\n&gt; world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And, here&#39;s a little dose of empathy, too....It<br/>\n&gt; would be nice if our <br/>\n&gt; kids came out of school, loved life and plunged into<br/>\n&gt; passions like <br/>\n&gt; saving the whales, but that&#39;s not real life.  Like<br/>\n&gt; it or not, <br/>\n&gt; unschooling is all about Real Life. :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Peace~Jessica <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Denise <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease visit Symphony Sam, an exciting upcoming TV show for children about Classical Music that we are creating:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmusic.org/SymphonySam\">http://www.hotmusic.org/SymphonySam</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

While it can happen that kids are ok","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1244860729\">What first struck me about your post was that you considered the time<br/>\nyour kids were watching TV to be your &quot;free time.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it can happen that kids are ok watching TV for a time while a<br/>\nparent does something else if your kids are fighting this shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nyour free time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might find free time when your kids are asleep or when your partner<br/>\ncan be with the kids or you might not get much or any free time until<br/>\nyour kids are older.   But the goal of unschooling is not to find<br/>\nconvenient free time for mom.  So maybe you need to reassess your<br/>\npriorities and think about whether unschooling is a deeply held<br/>\nbelief/philosophy for you or just why you chose this path. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a like minded partner maybe your best hope for finding some<br/>\nfree time at this stage in your kids lives would be those times when your<br/>\npartner can devote attention to the kids.   You won&#39;t ever get these same<br/>\nkids at this same age again and if your priority is finding time for<br/>\nyourself you&#39;ll be missing the joy of five and nine year olds and you&#39;ll<br/>\nbe cheating your kids.  I don&#39;t actually believe your priority is to find<br/>\nfree time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I rarely watch T.V. with the kids. They mostly watch videos which<br/>\ndon&#39;t interest <br/>\nme at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS because we don&#39;t have<br/>\n<br/>\ncable and either the shows interest them and not me***<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccessful unschooling and a strong relationship with your kids will<br/>\nabsolutely require you to be interested in what they&#39;re doing.  You don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to like cyberchase but you can watch with them and talk to them and<br/>\ndiscover why *they* like cyberchase.  That&#39;s the important thing here. <br/>\nNot that *you* like their programs but that you like to be with your<br/>\nkids, that you like to see their enthusiasm and enjoyment. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne possible step toward finding shows you all enjoy would be more<br/>\noptions.  If you&#39;re limiting their options on purpose I don&#39;t think you<br/>\nshould complain that you don&#39;t enjoy the shows they&#39;re choosing. &lt;g&gt;   I<br/>\nrecommend getting more channels and then maybe another TV so that even<br/>\nmore options are available to all of you.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I usually 99% of the time opt to get on the computer in my room, with<br/>\nthe door closed.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are blocking your children out.  Are you depressed?  Are you in a<br/>\nrut?   You need to be with them.  Children run around and play loudly,<br/>\nthat&#39;s what they do.  What&#39;s stopping you from playing with them?   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like to, but when I do, I am<br/>\neasily <br/>\nbored by what they do,***<br/>\n<br/>\nGet over it.  I know that sounds harsh but your children need you to be<br/>\ninvolved with them.  You can suggest games and shows you might all enjoy.<br/>\n You can bake cookies, have a mashed potato fight, have a water balloon<br/>\nfight, paint the sidewalk.   Do you need a list of fun things to offer<br/>\nand do with your kids?  People here could brainstorm for you. <br/>\nBut you should be interacting with them when they are doing the things<br/>\nthey enjoy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***or I am yelling at them to stop fighting (I&#39;m working on <br/>\nthe yelling issue, so more and more, I&#39;m talking to them constructively<br/>\nabout <br/>\nthey disputes!)***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good that your working on the yelling.  I recommend you stop yelling<br/>\nat once. &lt;g&gt;  As the great Yoda says &quot;Do or do not, there is no try.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSome constructive talk might be ok as long as constructive talk isn&#39;t<br/>\ncode for lecturing.  But at five and nine they need you mostly to fix the<br/>\nproblem.  What are the usual problems between them?  Is one invading the<br/>\nspace of the other?  What is going on with them? <br/>\n<br/>\n***when I try to discuss stuff that&#39;s interesting to me, they are <br/>\nbored with that! ***<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they mirroring your boredom with their shows and games?   I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink you can expect them to show an interest in what you&#39;re doing and in<br/>\nwhat you enjoy if you are not showing an interest in their activities. <br/>\nYou need to be an interested person for others to be interested in you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are disconnected from your kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***If they come to me saying they are bored, which often happens on the<br/>\nday we <br/>\nstay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it helps you to be<br/>\ncreative <br/>\nand I send them off to be bored elsewhere, so I can get some work<br/>\ndone.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re asking you for help and you&#39;re refusing.   What are you there<br/>\nfor?  Seriously.  Anyone could come into your house and cook and clean,<br/>\nso why are *you* there? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschooling to be successful you will need to be involved with your<br/>\nchildren.  That means helping them live and play happily, helping them<br/>\nfind things they love, helping them solve problems.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you went to your partner and said you were bored how would you feel if<br/>\nyour partner said, essentially, &quot;go away and be bored somewhere else.&quot;  <br/>\nHow many times could someone you love do that to you before you started<br/>\nto feel like you weren&#39;t important to them at all?  <br/>\n<br/>\n***So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much learning.***<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t try to get your kids to do things they are not interested in.  If<br/>\nthey don&#39;t like the library don&#39;t offer to take them there.   (Library&#39;s<br/>\nhave more than books though.  They have music, videos, audio books)<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to the park, take a lunch, take a kite, a ball, a Frisbee.   Go for a<br/>\nwalk, collect leaves, rocks, bugs.  Go for a hike, take food, ford<br/>\nstreams, catch frogs, take pictures.   Go to the pool, take water toys,<br/>\nplay.  Get squirt guns and blast each other.  Make up a wavy dance or a<br/>\nswishy dance or a &quot;bees are stinging my butt&quot; dance.  Play games.  Some<br/>\ngames that can be played with little kids are:  Mancalla, Set, Racko,<br/>\nTarget, Five Crowns, Checkers, Clue, Tic Tac Toe, Life, Survival or<br/>\nExtinction (dinosaur game) Chinese Checkers, Flinch, Sorry.   Play Mad<br/>\nLibs, ask your kids for silly word and then read them the resulting<br/>\nstory.    Have &quot;Monster Movie Night&quot; rent old monster movies and make<br/>\npopcorn and stomp around like Godzilla.   Go out for french fries.  Go<br/>\nout for ice cream.  Run races, ride bikes, go sledding, ice skating,<br/>\nroller skating.  Go play miniature golf.  Go bowling. <br/>\n<br/>\n***We live 2&1/2 hours from the nearest zoo and I hate to drive, so we<br/>\ndon&#39;t go <br/>\nthere,***<br/>\n<br/>\nI live two and a half hours from the nearest anything. &lt;g&gt;  Not really<br/>\nbut most things require us to drive some distance, usually forty miles or<br/>\nmore.   Get over it.  Seriously.  In the big scheme of things giving your<br/>\nkids a big life is more important than a bit of driving.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want to unschool?  I guess that&#39;s an important question.  Do you<br/>\nwant to, and why, and when you can answer that then I think you&#39;ll know<br/>\nif you can make the required adjustments to give your kids the best<br/>\nunschooling life. <br/>\n<br/>\n***So am I doing enough? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  Not even nearly.  Get up and do something now, even if you go hug<br/>\nthem and kiss them and tell them they&#39;re great.  But preferably go play<br/>\nwith them, go somewhere, be their best and most exciting friend.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I let them watch videos for hours, play video games for hours <br/>\ntoo, as long as they want, but am I providing enough interesting<br/>\nalternatives <br/>\nfor them?***<br/>\n<br/>\nTV and movies and games should be some choices among many choices not<br/>\ntheir only choice.  You need to be offering more.  They can accept or<br/>\ndecline but you need to be offering them the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Are they to learn almost everything from videos and video games?***<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely not.   Those things should be one option among endless options<br/>\nand you should be the most shining option of all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230706843,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"Betsy Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Help regarding my role in unschooling-long!","postDate":"1128524865","msgId":108764,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzNDNFQzQxLjcwNjA1MDlAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRodm5ibytpMDVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRodm5ibytpMDVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":108762,"nextInTopic":108767,"prevInTime":108763,"nextInTime":108765,"topicId":108755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**They mostly watch videos which don t interest me at all and the only actual T.V. we have is PBS because we don t have cable and either the shows interest","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-308148006\">**They mostly watch videos which don&#39;t interest<br/>\nme at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS because we don&#39;t have<br/>\ncable and either the shows interest them and not me (like cyberchase) or <br/>\nthey interest me and not them...**<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about renting some great family movies from Netflix or the video <br/>\nstore?  (Or borrowing from friends or picking them up at garage sales?)  <br/>\nYou might find stuff that&#39;s of general interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I can relate some to what you are saying, because when we first <br/>\ngot cable TV we also (without asking) were given a second TV.  My son <br/>\nwanted to stay home a lot, we had just moved and didn&#39;t have local <br/>\nfriends.  It was easy for us to fall into a pattern where we were <br/>\nwatching TV in seperate rooms.  (There were lots of shows that I <br/>\nprefered over his choices.)  During the same period, I also spent a lot <br/>\nof time on this computer and on this and other lists.  But I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it these choices good for our relationship.  I think our <br/>\nrelationship got pretty thin in that time period. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the excitement of cable wore off, we both watch less TV most days, <br/>\nbut I now follow the advice here and spend some of my day sitting and <br/>\nwatching with him. We don&#39;t talk a lot during the shows, as he isn&#39;t <br/>\nvery talkative, but we do talk some, and I get clues about what he is <br/>\ninterested in.  If I don&#39;t find the beginning of the show very <br/>\ninteresting, I have been known to fold laundry or flip through a <br/>\nmagazine if I wasn&#39;t fascinated by his viewing choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I think it was key to me to recognize that my habits were choices, and <br/>\nat any moment in the day I could chose something different or something <br/>\nbetter.  And I had the same nagging feeling that you have that I wasn&#39;t <br/>\ninteracting with him enough.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are really loud inside and you are concerned that they are <br/>\nwatching too much TV, can you get them outside more for active play?  <br/>\n(I&#39;d rather go to the park with a friend than alone, but I can slake my <br/>\nneed for entertainment with a magazine or with music on headphones.)  <br/>\nMost places in the N. hemisphere the weather is only going to get worse, <br/>\nso go while you still can.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am definitely have been guilty of letting my son entertain himself <br/>\nwhile I pursue my own interests.  But I&#39;m trying to come to some more <br/>\nreasonable balance.  (I think there was a period when I was completely <br/>\ntapped out from the 24/7 mothering routine and all the interrupted <br/>\nnights, but now I have more to give.)  In my case, he seemed engrossed <br/>\nby the cable TV and was not telling me he was bored.  I think that if he <br/>\nhad told me that, I would have woken up sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\n** If they come to me saying they are bored, which often happens on the <br/>\nday we stay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it helps you to <br/>\nbe creative and I send them off to be bored elsewhere**<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  Take this as a sign that they want to interact with you, or with <br/>\nsomeone or something new and interesting.

Are there ways you could <br/>\nget quiet time for yourself *other times* in the week, when someone else <br/>\nis with the kids?  Are you depressed or just frazzled?

They love <br/>\neach other and have a wonderful relationship, but they are not really <br/>\nplaymates for eachother right now at their life stages.  It is <br/>\nextremely important to me that they have a respectful relationship,a <br/>\nnd that means that I am involved in a lot of their playing.  I could <br/>\nnot have a closed door in my house with me on one side and them on <br/>\nthe other and not have a fight erupt after about 30 minutes.  They <br/>\nwould be crazed by the time I was on the computer for an hour or an <br/>\nhour and 1/2.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds as if you are new to this, and so are your children.  They <br/>\nmay want to lead their lives, but they will need some ideas and <br/>\nenthusiastic involvement.  We saw the SpongeBob movie and there is a <br/>\nsong with something about &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;.  Most mornings, I <br/>\nsay, &quot;Okay!  Today is going to be the best day ever! Let&#39;s_____! <br/>\n(sometimes, it is stay in our pjs and watch Hamtaro!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t sugar coat it, more often than not my enthusiasm is met with <br/>\nrolling eyes from my tween :).

Did their love of <br/>\nbooks and art get fed today(and my kids DO happen to love books and <br/>\ndrawing~for you it may be legos or anime or video games)?  Where is <br/>\nthe balance in our lives?  Do they need balance today, or is today <br/>\njust a computer game all day kind of day or read all day or park all <br/>\nday?  Sometimes an imbalance is okay, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, lastly, I *do* watch Cyberchase, Foster&#39;s Home for Imaginary <br/>\nFriends and Spiderman, because there is ***so much*** that my <br/>\nchildren get out of those shows.  We raced home yesterday from the <br/>\npark to catch a show, and watched it togther.  No, it is not <br/>\nsomething I would choose to watch (I am more of a Lifetime Channel <br/>\nmovie gal myself), but for me, unschooling is all about CONNECTIONS.  <br/>\nIf you aren&#39;t connected to what your children are doing, you can&#39;t <br/>\nexpand those connections with things that will be meaningful to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, you have to give first.  If you want them to get up <br/>\nearlier to participate in some thins that you think might interest <br/>\nthem, you have to show that you know and care about what interests <br/>\nthem now.  If you are bored by their playing, and they know it, they <br/>\nwon&#39;t trust that you know what is fun in the outside world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, here&#39;s a little dose of empathy, too....It would be nice if our <br/>\nkids came out of school, loved life and plunged into passions like <br/>\nsaving the whales, but that&#39;s not real life.  Like it or not, <br/>\nunschooling is all about Real Life. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace~Jessica</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help regarding my role in unschooling-long!","postDate":"1128515265","msgId":108759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRpMGdzMStuc2FhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMDA1MTIwODE2LldYQkkxNjMzNC5tdGExMC5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAZWJvbnk+"},"prevInTopic":108758,"nextInTopic":108761,"prevInTime":108758,"nextInTime":108760,"topicId":108755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... letting ... environment and ...

I am pulling out the old Family Math book<br/>\nand we&#39;re playing games and solving puzzles right and left. I am math<br/>\nphobic so I&#39;ve been learning lots of coll things at the livingmath.net<br/>\nsite which is giving me tools for how to enrich our home environment<br/>\nusing fiction and other books (not workbooks) to help create a math<br/>\nrich environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been much more fun than I expected and I&#39;m starting to feel smart<br/>\n(where I&#39;ve always felt not smart) with numbers.

My kids<br/>\nhave motivated me to do things that I am not comfortable with that I know<br/>\nwill benefit them.  How about driving more often so you are not<br/>\nuncomfortable taking them to the zoo and other places.  Or just deciding<br/>\nthat you&#39;ll do it despite the fact that you feel uncomfortable.  Feeling<br/>\nuncomfortable never killed anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe county fair doesn&#39;t have to be expensive.  (and sending kids to school<br/>\nisn&#39;t cheap either, between decent clothes, lunch money, school pictures,<br/>\nsport uniforms, etc)  We often go for just the price of admission.  Bring<br/>\nyour own food and spend the day browsing the animal barn, watching the horse<br/>\nshows, the horses on the track, or the demonstrations. They are all free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched Super Nanny with the kids the other day (not something I&#39;d choose<br/>\non my own, but it launches many good conversations) and the kids on that<br/>\nshow spend the day fighting while the mother hid out in her room with her<br/>\nlaptop.  It was the saddest thing I ever saw.  She didn&#39;t even like her kids<br/>\nand spent time just trying to get away from them.  The kids had NEVER played<br/>\na game with their mother before, for goodness sakes.  Those poor kids were<br/>\nstarved for attention and would take any attention they could get, good or<br/>\nbad.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the time my kids were big enough to hold cards, we&#39;ve played games with<br/>\nthem.  My kids love to be read to.  (they aren&#39;t crazy about going to the<br/>\nlibrary either but are always glad they went when we get home with a bunch<br/>\nof books and movies.)  I read to them often and if they don’t see a book<br/>\nthey think they would like, then I pick out books that I think they would<br/>\nlike and when we have some quiet time I read an excerpt from it and see if<br/>\nthey like it.  If they reject it, we move on.  No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like you all need to sit down and make a list of all the<br/>\nthings they would like to do (with your help on the idea end of course) and<br/>\nthen try to go through the list and do the things that are possible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if the sleeping schedule you are all on isn&#39;t working then talk about<br/>\nhow the changes could affect you (benefit you all) and make the changes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are present with the kids during the day and you help them to resolve<br/>\ntheir differences before they are outright fights, you home will be a lot<br/>\nmore peaceful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last point I want to make is that unschooling isn&#39;t just about letting<br/>\nthe children lead, it&#39;s about providing a rich supportive environment and<br/>\ninteracting with your kids.

I worry I may have gone <br/>\ntoo far in the opposite direction and am bordering on neglect!<br/>\nHere is a typical day for us:<br/>\nWe&#39;ll wake up around 9 or 10 am, usually the kids will get up first, and they&#39;ll <br/>\nplay or watch T.V or a video until they get hungry. Sometimes they&#39;ll grab <br/>\nthemselves something to eat, but more often than not, they want me to make <br/>\nbreakfast for them and so they&#39;ll drag me out of bed to make it (I&#39;m usually up <br/>\nuntil 1 or 2am)  After breakfast and clean up, I usually read and answer e-<br/>\nmails or search the internet for information for about an hour or an hour and a <br/>\nhalf. By then they&#39;re usually ready for lunch or snack or whatever, we don&#39;t <br/>\nreally call it anything, just &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;eat&quot;, so I make some more food, <br/>\nclean up and pack food for our afternoon outing. 2 days a week we go to a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s house for playgroup, one or two days a week we go to the park with <br/>\nanother homeschool group or two and one day during the week we stay <br/>\nhome all day. (although lately my husband has been taking them to work that <br/>\nday, so I can have the day off!)<br/>\nWe usually get to our destination by 2pm and stay until 5 or 6pm and come <br/>\nhome, eat again, and the kids watch T.V. or play with each other (with a LOT <br/>\nof fighting!)<br/>\nI usually spend any free time I have reading or on the computer, I run a food <br/>\nbuying club and that takes up my evenings as well as more e-mails and <br/>\ninternet searches.<br/>\nI rarely watch T.V. with the kids. They mostly watch videos which don&#39;t interest <br/>\nme at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS because we don&#39;t have <br/>\ncable and either the shows interest them and not me (like cyberchase) or they <br/>\ninterest me and not them (like documentaries) and even then, I really can&#39;t <br/>\nwatch these because they&#39;re running around playing loudly, so I usually 99% <br/>\nof the time opt to get on the computer in my room, with the door closed.<br/>\nSo, I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like to, but when I do, I am easily <br/>\nbored by what they do, or I am yelling at them to stop fighting (I&#39;m working on <br/>\nthe yelling issue, so more and more, I&#39;m talking to them constructively about <br/>\nthey disputes!) when I try to discuss stuff that&#39;s interesting to me, they are <br/>\nbored with that! So we usually go our own ways, them playing and watching <br/>\nvideos/PBS and me, preparing food, cleaning up and getting on my computer. <br/>\nIf they come to me saying they are bored, which often happens on the day we <br/>\nstay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it helps you to be creative <br/>\nand I send them off to be bored elsewhere, so I can get some work done. It <br/>\nnever fails to get them to play something new or old always creative!<br/>\nSo, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much learning. I do interact with them <br/>\nwhen they come to me, will answer questions about how to spell something or <br/>\nwhere the scotch tape is, or what&#39;s the difference between a lion and a tiger <br/>\n(we usually look it up on the internet together and find pictures etc...) but that&#39;s <br/>\nit. I don&#39;t sit with them watching T.V. except on rare occasions when it sucks <br/>\nme in, I don&#39;t go to the library with them very much (about once a month) <br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t like it and say they don&#39;t want books! I don&#39;t take them to <br/>\ntheater shows because the homeschool groups (and the affordable tickets) <br/>\nare in the mornings and they really resist getting up early and haven&#39;t enjoyed <br/>\nthe few we have gone to very much. I don&#39;t do any curriculum or workbooks <br/>\nunless I&#39;m specificlly asked to buy such and such workbook, and then I don&#39;t <br/>\ndo the stuff in the workbook with them unless specifically asked.<br/>\nWe live 2&1/2 hours from the nearest zoo and I hate to drive, so we don&#39;t go <br/>\nthere, amusement parks and the county fair are not in our budget (they&#39;ve <br/>\nasked to go to disneyworld or disneyland and the zoo lately.)<br/>\nSo am I doing enough? <br/>\nAm I neglectful? I let them watch videos for hours, play video games for hours <br/>\ntoo, as long as they want, but am I providing enough interesting alternatives <br/>\nfor them? Are they to learn almost everything from videos and video games?<br/>\nI keep trying to let them be my guides, let them lead, but lately my daughter is <br/>\nbeen asking to go back to school, so obviously I must not be providing what <br/>\nshe needs. I ask her why, what school offers that homeschooling doesn&#39;t and <br/>\nshe can&#39;t articulate it.<br/>\nAny help would be appreciated!<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nDenise</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108810,"nextTopicId":108630}}
