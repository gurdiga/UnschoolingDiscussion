Here it is, Sat.<br/>\n&gt; night, and  I have been gone all day, and have just gone through the posts<br/>\n&gt; regarding feminism/daycare.  I have been on this list since late March.<br/>\nThis<br/>\n&gt; is not the first time a heated discussion has taken place....one of the<br/>\nlast<br/>\n&gt; &quot;biggies&quot; was about nursing vs bottle feeding.  It went on for what seemed<br/>\n&gt; like about 2 weeks.It was filled with emotion, and passion, facts, and<br/>\n&gt; opinions, much like this topic is.  It is my hope that everyone can agree<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; disagree, and move on.  Pris, I really enjoy your posts.  It would be sad<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; lose you due to a topic that will run its course in a matter of time.  I<br/>\nhope<br/>\n&gt; that you, and everyone else, will stay on.    There are so many points I<br/>\n&gt; agree and disagree with from the posts, but, ultimately, I think what<br/>\nmatters<br/>\n&gt; most is doing what is right for each of our families to the best of our<br/>\n&gt; abilities.~ Karen </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9909,"nextTopicId":9702}}
