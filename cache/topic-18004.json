I&#39;m also an <br/>\nintuitive/spiritual/psychic healer.  (I never know what to &quot;call&quot; it-it is <br/>\nall of these things and more- all I know is that it works and I feel very <br/>\nblessed to be able to do it!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t any natural healing modalities that I can think of off the top <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve seen or heard of that are harmful, and as with anything, all <br/>\ntherapies need to be done with thought and care.
