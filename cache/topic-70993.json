My husband makes a Donald Duck noise to talk to <br/>\nhim....why he chose that I don&#39;t know...and every time you talk to him in a <br/>\nDonald Duck voice he flutters his wings and opens wide up for food.  It is <br/>\nso hilarious!  When I hold him he jumps up on my shoulder and snuggles his <br/>\nbeak behind my ear and goes to sleep.  I tell ya, it&#39;s hard not to just fall <br/>\nin love with him and want to keep him forever.  My husband is trying to <br/>\nconvince me that we need to keep him so I&#39;m hoping one day, during our <br/>\noutdoor excursions, that he will just up and fly away.  I know it will be <br/>\nbittersweet but I really want to see him happy and free.  We have lovely <br/>\ntrees and a plethora of birds in the neighborhood.  Today, we watched a <br/>\nfamily of morning doves feeding.  There were four babies and they kept <br/>\nfalling off the feeding perch.  It was so cute to watch them study their <br/>\nnext move and figure out how to get back up that high.  The momma bird would <br/>\nstand behind them and push them and just sing and sing.  We were all in the <br/>\ngirls room watching through the window while my grandparents were watching <br/>\nfrom their kitchen.  What a nice moment for us all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have an elaborate bird viewing set-up between our houses....various <br/>\nhouses, feeders and bird attracting flora so it is a great place to live if <br/>\nyou are a bird, or enjoy bird watching!  I&#39;d be happy for our little fella <br/>\nto live out his life here.  I just hope he is ready to go before we move. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
