Don&#39;t make them do any academics at all, but answer any <br/>\nquestions they have and do things with them. Don&#39;t worry whether <br/>\nthey&#39;re learning anything or not. Just be with them. With regular <br/>\nhomeschooling, the first year after they come home, playing with <br/>\nthem, hanging out with them, doing stuff together, or letting them do <br/>\ntheir own thing, re-establishes your relationship with them. That is <br/>\nthe MOST important thing. MUCH MORE important than academics.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers on this list will have advice for you, I know it ;) Read! John <br/>\nHolt! unschooling.com articles! and let your kids do their thing, <br/>\nenjoying them, pulling them into your world, dwelling in their world <br/>\nwith them. I would say this to you even if you weren&#39;t thinking of <br/>\nunschooling.
