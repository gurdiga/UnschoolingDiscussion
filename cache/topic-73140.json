This paragraph <br/>\nreminds me of that new commercial running in California right now by First Five, <br/>\na supposedly educational group. It begins with a college student saying if he <br/>\ngoes to college, he will be a happier adult, then to a high school student <br/>\nsaying if he does &quot;well&quot; in high school, he&#39;ll get into a &quot;good&quot; college, then <br/>\ndown to jr high, then down to elementary and then get this: If I attend <br/>\npreschool and do well....WHAT???? Talk about getting kids out of the house at an early <br/>\nage!!! This is the exact propaganda that makes children believe if they don&#39;t <br/>\nfit the mold, their lives won&#39;t be happy and therefore possibly not worthy of <br/>\nliving.

You want him to want what you want for him. It&#39;s not<br/>\nthat you want bad things for him. It sounds like you want good things for<br/>\nhim.
