This story reminds me a bit of my<br/>\ndad, who always had the knack for just *knowing* what was important to<br/>\nme and how to fix it.  Sometimes he’d tell a story from his childhood,<br/>\nsometimes he’d make a simple suggestion, sometimes he’d leave me alone<br/>\nto work through it myself, and sometimes he’d walk me through it step by<br/>\nstep.  But he was always there, in the background, and it’s from him I<br/>\nlearned how to ask for help without shame or embarrassment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your story Julie, it brought tears to my eyes and warm<br/>\nfuzzies all over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle, SF Bay Area<br/>\nMommy to the bright-eyed Rory Daniel, 5.3.02<br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Julie Bogart [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 31, 2003 3:52 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: Introducing The Rall Family<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I couldn&#39;t sleep and got up to tell my grandparents <br/>\nthat I felt guilty for buying a craft I might never complete.
