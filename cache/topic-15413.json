Haven&#39;t you sat<br/>\nat the computer for just an hour or so too long<br/>\nsometimes not cuz you don&#39;t want to get on with doing<br/>\nother things that you like but just becuz there is<br/>\nsome sort of invisible tractor beam that makes you<br/>\nstay and stay? &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The shooting games have skill-solving, logic,<br/>\n&gt; concentration and persistance <br/>\n&gt; too!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>um......yeah....but when playing them you also are<br/>\npretending....you&#39;re SHOOTING someone. Maybe older<br/>\nkids or grown ups even are able to separate &quot;real&quot;<br/>\nguns and &quot;pretend&quot; ones, but in my mind little kids<br/>\ncan&#39;t make that definition yet (as in my 5 year old<br/>\nson)...He knows that it would be wrong to shoot<br/>\nsomeone, but if there were a real gun in front of him<br/>\nand he was already accustomed to &quot;pretend guns&quot; in<br/>\ngames...(that are actually very graphic with blood and<br/>\neverything flying everywhere and it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>\nentertaining)...how would he justify that it&#39;s ok to<br/>\npretend you&#39;re shooting someone to bits and not to<br/>\ntouch a gun in real life? I&#39;m just not comfortable<br/>\nwith the idea of teaching him that these weapons that<br/>\nare used primarily for taking life are ok to &quot;pretend&quot;<br/>\nabout.<br/>\n<br/>\nahem. sorry, I tend to get a little carried away on<br/>\nthis subject which I have oft discussed with my<br/>\nsister, whose son has no restrictions about games and<br/>\nowns a bb gun etc. at age 13. <br/>\n<br/>\n but at<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; least one will question the <br/>\n&gt; proviso &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well, good. like someone said before, how boring it<br/>\nwould be if no one questioned anything. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a child is fascinated by and engrossed in<br/>\n&gt; something, what are legitimate <br/>\n&gt; reasons to make him stop?  I&#39;ve heard a hundred<br/>\n&gt; spurious ones over the years.<br/>\n&gt; My mom said several times to me, in the tone of<br/>\n&gt; voice you&#39;d think would be <br/>\n&gt; saved for people doing something really disgusting,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Get your nose out of <br/>\n&gt; that book and go outside and play.&quot;  Because she<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t see the value in <br/>\n&gt; what I was doing, and it didn&#39;t involve her, she<br/>\n&gt; wanted me to stop.   <br/>\n&gt; How would any of you like it if you were right in<br/>\n&gt; the middle of writing one <br/>\n&gt; of the best things you ever wrote (no matter how<br/>\n&gt; long you had been at the <br/>\n&gt; computer) and someone twice your size (or just your<br/>\n&gt; mother) blasted in <br/>\n&gt; without even waiting politely to see if you were at<br/>\n&gt; a stopping place and <br/>\n&gt; commanded you to turn it off or said &quot;That&#39;s enough&quot;<br/>\n&gt; or &quot;your brain will rot&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>AAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!<br/>\nwhat a horrible story! I&#39;ll probably have a nightmare<br/>\nabout it! &lt;g&gt; that&#39;s awful. And I never do that to<br/>\nSatori, as I consider myself more a kid than a grown<br/>\nup in all the good wayz (I have fought &quot;crossing over&quot;<br/>\nquite determinedly), and I do know the value of never<br/>\nturning his video game off when he&#39;s just about to win<br/>\na world, etc. He works so hard at it and is able to<br/>\nconcentrate on it without any effort. He actually<br/>\nlikes it much better when i play WITH him. I get<br/>\nconstant updates on how he&#39;s doing and where secret<br/>\nworlds are. Ds and his &quot;second daddy&quot; (instead of<br/>\n&quot;step daddy&quot;)just came running in to let me know that<br/>\none of them had found a secret barrel in Donkey Kong<br/>\nCountry that took them past the WHOLE cart world! cool<br/>\nbeans. No, I don&#39;t think his brains will rot, but I do<br/>\nwant him to not be limited to just ONE thing he<br/>\nenjoys, as there are so many things he wants to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And if nothing else in the house is more involving<br/>\n&gt; or alluring than that <br/>\n&gt; video game, maybe your child knows what he&#39;s doing,<br/>\n&gt; sticking with the best <br/>\n&gt; thing available to him, or maybe you need to look at<br/>\n&gt; his options and improve <br/>\n&gt; the competition.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>On the contrary he runs around trying a little of this<br/>\na little of that, not knowing which he wants to do<br/>\nfirst, he&#39;ll fight with his sister to be able to do<br/>\ntheir JumpStart Math Game and then starts Donkey Kong<br/>\nand forgets he was waiting for that, and then gets on<br/>\nthe computer (after I remind he asked for it) and<br/>\nforgets he made it very clear to everyone that HE had<br/>\ndibs on the tv for wishbone and dragontales. :) Then<br/>\ndraws in his &quot;how to draw superheroes&quot; book while he<br/>\nwatches them and waits for me to &quot;get things ready&quot;<br/>\nfor &quot;making stuff&quot; or baking cookies, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you let him quit when he&#39;s done, he WILL quit,<br/>\n&gt; and he will have been <br/>\n&gt; empowered to finish things when he&#39;s finished<br/>\n&gt; instead of living by the <br/>\n&gt; clock<br/>\n </span></blockquote>HA!<br/>\nmy boyfriend always jokes that I have NO concept of<br/>\ntime. The only clocks I ever see are here on the puter<br/>\nand on my phone. We do things til we&#39;re done (and<br/>\nsometimes beyond, it&#39;s in our natures). Including<br/>\nvideo games, but sometimes those things get<br/>\nfrustrating if you don&#39;t take a break and do something<br/>\nelse. Like getting a fresh perspective. Like curing<br/>\nwriter&#39;s block when you&#39;re stuck in the middle of a<br/>\npiece you&#39;ve been working on for dayz and dayz on end.<br/>\nBut whatever we switch to, we tend to get caught up in<br/>\nfor longer then we want to be and so I try to keep<br/>\nthings moving so that we don&#39;t end up getting bored<br/>\nwith things we like.<br/>\nMany times I&#39;ll remind Satori that he wanted to do<br/>\nsomething else to, or suggest a new activity for<br/>\nawhile, and then find myself saying &quot;wait! don&#39;t just<br/>\nturn it off, you&#39;ll lose all those levels you won!&quot;<br/>\n&lt;g&gt; and for two days one time we kept the Nintendo on<br/>\nand just turned the monitor off, cuz we just needed to<br/>\nbeat ONE more castle so we could save the game and not<br/>\nhave to start all over.

When my son was younger he had a Sega that he <br/>\nbought with his own money. Now he has a PlayStation that he and a friend <br/>\nbought from another friend that came with a lot of sports games. Mostly these <br/>\ndays he plays games on the computer but now that he has a job he has less <br/>\ntime to play. He got a football game for Christmas from us and his older <br/>\nsister.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids say that first of all if your son&#39;s cousins have a Nintendo 64, he <br/>\nwill probably not be satisfied with a SuperNintendo. If they have a <br/>\nSuperNintendo then that would probably suffice. Nintendo 64 is somewhat older <br/>\nthan the newest models from other companies but still popular. One issue with <br/>\nold models is finding games. You could find second hand games but not rentals <br/>\nfor a Super Nintendo. My kids have always had to buy these things for <br/>\nthemselves. My now 15yo son saved Christmas and Birthday money for a year to <br/>\nbuy his Sega when he was 7 or 8 yo. He says you should not torture your son <br/>\nin this way and should buy the Nintendo for him (LOL) ;.)<br/>\n                                 -Amalia, mother to Jenny 20, Michael, 15 and <br/>\nAriana 11</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"&quot;Elizabeth Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4PwmqyQ9T6C2kjbiYlsWeBlZOfhqITTxd83fh0zd7qQPAIYFadckoxjrTrSW9ktya9AE4oUstixjIWR8juVwBW7lKLlRoqiDPKnEbx1UabyH","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] video games / computer games","postDate":"980616006","msgId":15430,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2OThCM0Q1LTI0ODIyQDYzLjM2LjIwOC4yNTQ+"},"prevInTopic":15425,"nextInTopic":15432,"prevInTime":15429,"nextInTime":15431,"topicId":15413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
