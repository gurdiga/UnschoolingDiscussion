I don&#39;t want to dictate what she can and can&#39;t be <br/>\n    interrested in though; i want her to learn to make her own choices and not <br/>\n    rely on someone else to tell her what to do, so i just let it go.  I found <br/>\n    that she isn&#39;t into it because it&#39;s cool to be, she really loves the <br/>\n    characters and the shows. <br/>\n    I have also found some positive aspects to the craze.  One thing, it&#39;s <br/>\n    something that   just about every kid knows something about, and it&#39;s an easy <br/>\n    ice breaker.  She starts conversations with kids all the time with pokemon. <br/>\n    I notice they may start with pokemon, but they end up talking about or <br/>\n    playing other things after a while.  And at the few burger king trading <br/>\n    nights we&#39;ve been to, it all begins with pokemon, but after a while the kids <br/>\n    end up in the play area making up new games and just playing. <br/>\n    One of the best &#39;pokemon experiences&#39; i had was when i was with my daughter <br/>\n    at the swap meet, and she told the vendor that he was selling a certain card <br/>\n    for much less than it was worth.  He looked it up, and sure enough, she was <br/>\n    right.  He was very impressed and thanked her for telling him.  Afterwards, <br/>\n    she said she really wanted the card, and had enough money to buy it at the <br/>\n    low price, but she knew that that was the wrong thing to do.  I told her i <br/>\n    was proud of her.  I think if i concentrate on the values i believe are <br/>\n    important, like honesty, tolerance, kindness, respect, she can go through as <br/>\n    many &#39;fads&#39; as she wants and come out with things that really matter. <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please click above to support our sponsor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thad Martin","from":"Thad Martin &lt;tmartin@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4N0fa0OhIRKbpWuOrlLA6NzNINW-ea13OJta_yR7fz0Pe3LV2MTRdznKZU9113kF50HVfJb6krAr9AaES4XV1XjHW_tS0SDhBQM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Respecting children&#39;s choices/paths of","postDate":"947258112","msgId":5515,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNjQuNTUxNS45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5511,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":5514,"nextInTime":5516,"topicId":5511,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi, they have a web site and their first issue is free (the issue this article is in is the second issue).   i enjoy the mag very much.  i find it intelligent","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2098029338\">hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nthey have a web site and their first issue is free (the issue this<br/>\narticle is in is the second issue).   i enjoy the mag very much.  i find<br/>\nit intelligent and thought provoking as well as some what diverse - not<br/>\njust homeschooling but includes many different alternatives to<br/>\nmainstream thought on education.   they include writes of students which<br/>\nis a very nice addition.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\n<br/>\nDebra Bures wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Susan Tell me more about this magazine, paths of learning, please<br/>\n&gt; Debra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5480,"nextTopicId":5477}}
