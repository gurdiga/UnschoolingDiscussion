I still feel that way when I ride a bike.<br/>\n I didn&#39;t learn until the third grade.  My neighbor tried to help me<br/>\nlearn in the first grade.  He pushed me on his bike that was too big for<br/>\nme.  I went right into a big hole in the road where they were doing<br/>\nconstruction.  I skinned myself and accused him of doing it on purpose. <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t really.  But he felt so bad.<br/>\nAll four of my children taught themselves to ride when my step-dad bought<br/>\nthem bikes.  Right now all our bikes are broke.  We need to learn how to<br/>\nfix them.  There is a place in town called Alternative Transportation<br/>\nwhere they actually teach you how to fix and make all sorts of non-motor<br/>\nself-propelled vehicles.<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34053,"nextTopicId":34043}}
