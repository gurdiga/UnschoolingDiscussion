Just before the New Year<br/>\nthere was a programme on the telly with loads of tips for parties from<br/>\nbutlers and professional party organisers.  One tip was that if you have a<br/>\nbottle of sparkling wine open, a teaspoon stuck in the top, handle down,<br/>\nwill stop it from going flat.  We tried it and it works, but does anyone<br/>\nknow why?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and yesterday, while I was at a LLL Spring Workshop, dd1 asked dh the<br/>\nsame question a few times, so he said, &#39;I really like answering your<br/>\nquestions, but it gets boring when it&#39;s the same one all the time, can you<br/>\nvary it a bit?&#39;  She thought for a while, and asked the same question again,<br/>\nso he reminded her that he&#39;d asked her to ask something different.  She<br/>\nsaid, &#39;I did ask it differently!&#39; which she had, the same question, but<br/>\ndifferently.
