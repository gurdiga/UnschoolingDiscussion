You&#39;re right that &quot;Would you like me to help you find <br/>\nsomething else to play with&quot; is not usually the appropriate <br/>\nattention-getter! What you also describe, of a kid being able to take <br/>\nthe next steps independently after &quot;wait&quot; is also true to our <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy partner and I make a conscious effort not to repeat messages beyond <br/>\ntheir useful life. We also don&#39;t lecture in the sense of articulating <br/>\nthe moral of the story (like, say, &quot;Now, see, if you had worn your coat <br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t be cold now,&quot; or &quot;if you hadn&#39;t started blowing bubbles <br/>\nwhen the glass was still full, there wouldn&#39;t be a big mess now. Next <br/>\ntime, wait until you&#39;ve drunk some of the milk.&quot;). But that&#39;s not on <br/>\nthe immediate topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I like the idea that moms should think of saying &quot;NO&quot; as though the <br/>\nchild<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  comes with 200 tickets at birth.   Some moms use them all up the <br/>\n&gt; first year and<br/>\n&gt;  the child ignores &quot;no&quot; forever after.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like this too! I&#39;ve been experimenting (for purposes of my own) with <br/>\nhaving no-free days. Fun! And requires creativity!<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody should actually hand out the tickets before moms leave the <br/>\nhospital. Would be much more useful than the diaper bags packed with <br/>\nformula samples they give out now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  -=-I simply meant to say that Bailey&#39;s philosophy of<br/>\n&gt;  attributing a positive motivation to behavior has been a fruitful idea<br/>\n&gt;  for us.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Can you give us examples of that in your own real life, from your own<br/>\n&gt;  experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Um, let me think a minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, here&#39;s one thing that we sailed through but that seems to give some <br/>\nother moms we know fits: kids reaching the stage, around the age of <br/>\n2-3, where they ask for a certain food and then change their mind and <br/>\nthen change their mind again and then change their mind again until the <br/>\nmom is about to tear her hair out. I figured that at that age, my son <br/>\nwas working on a pretty complicated developmental task: trying to learn <br/>\nhow to know what food he had a taste for before he had seen or tasted <br/>\nit (I did not, as others sometimes seem to, think he was working on the <br/>\ntask of figuring out how far he could push his mother or how much he <br/>\ncould &quot;get away with.&quot;). That seems like a big, complicated task to me, <br/>\nand one that even grown-ups don&#39;t always get right, as anyone who has <br/>\never looked at their plate in a restaurant and said, &quot;I shoulda ordered <br/>\nthe salmon&quot; can attest.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at it that way helped me to avoid getting angry with him, or <br/>\ntrying to make it into a &quot;discipline&quot; issue (&quot;I cooked you that egg <br/>\nbecause you asked for it and you are by golly going to eat it!&quot;). I did <br/>\nthink about how much I was willing to do without resentment, and in <br/>\ngeneral that was limited to cooking one thing, with additional choices <br/>\nnot requiring cooking. That was also about the time we invented the <br/>\n&quot;sampler plate,&quot; where, if he couldn&#39;t make up his mind, I would just <br/>\nput two bites of everything I could think of onto a plate for him to <br/>\nlook at and taste. This really helped him--he would either just eat the <br/>\nsampler plate, or after having it to look at and maybe taste, know <br/>\nwhich things he wanted more of. Eventually, that stage passed as he got <br/>\nbetter at anticipating what food would taste good to him, but he <br/>\nsometimes still asks for a sampler plate just for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric was also able to find his own positive motivation recently, and <br/>\ndescribe it to me. He was taking a music class that he loved. The <br/>\nguidelines for behavior at the class were that kids were not required <br/>\nto participate in any activity, and they weren&#39;t prevented from doing <br/>\nsomething else, but they weren&#39;t to do things that interfered with <br/>\nother people being able to attend to the leader, or participate. My son <br/>\nwas wild in this class! He could not stay still; he could not confine <br/>\nhimself to a walk; he would actively try to recruit other kids for <br/>\nrough games unrelated to the class activities. When we talked about <br/>\nthis, he told me that this behavior was because he loved the class so <br/>\nmuch and was so excited to be there that he just had to express it <br/>\nphysically (&quot;I&#39;m so happy that my body just wants to get up and jump <br/>\naround!&quot;). He wasn&#39;t &quot;misbehaving&quot; or &quot;being bad&quot; and the answer wasn&#39;t <br/>\nto try to force him to sit still or move quietly in music class. He was <br/>\nable to articulate the positive motivation behind his behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still haven&#39;t solved this problem; he wants to take the class again <br/>\nthis fall, but he is pretty sure he will still want to jump around when <br/>\nhe is there. But we haven&#39;t had conflict about it, which is perhaps why <br/>\nhe can tell me honestly that he thinks his behavior will continue to <br/>\nviolate the class guidelines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about the positive motivation behind a behavior, or thinking <br/>\nabout the development task our son might be working on, helps us not <br/>\nfall into adversarial thinking with regard to him. If he&#39;s working on <br/>\nlearning something, of course we want to help him learn it. If he has a <br/>\nneed or a desire, of course we want that to get met.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis works for grown-ups, too. If I&#39;m getting cranky with the kids or <br/>\nmy partner, or letting the housework sink below my usual low standards, <br/>\nit&#39;s not because I&#39;m &quot;bad.&quot; It&#39;s a sign that I have an unmet <br/>\nneed--usually for a good stretch of quiet alone time. I might be trying <br/>\nto meet my need for quiet time during the times I would otherwise be <br/>\nbeating back the forces of chaos and dog hair; that doesn&#39;t work from a <br/>\nhouse-cleanliness perspective and neither is it very quality quiet <br/>\ntime. So I need to find a better way to meet that need, usually with my <br/>\npartner&#39;s help.

The title, in fact, doesn&#39;t seem to fit <br/>\nthe book at all and probably hurts her sales. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs background- I found the book being discussed on <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/\">http://www.gentlechristianmothers.com/</a> when looking for advice for a <br/>\nDobson follower. She was only willing to read Christian authors. I <br/>\nwas not looking to &quot;discipline&quot; my kids. I was, however, intrigued <br/>\nby the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I should list more specifics about why I DID like the book.<br/>\nSome of these ideas may sound obvious to you, but it came as a shock <br/>\nto me to hear things spelled out so simply. The family environment I <br/>\nwas raised in did nothing to help me learn these skills...<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the 7 &quot;attitude shifts&quot; she discusses and what I thought <br/>\nabout them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude shift 1: Harnessing the Power of Perception  (no one can <br/>\nmake you angry without your permission)<br/>\nReason: to own your own upset<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice how your thoughts create your feelings. when you feel angry, <br/>\noverwhelmed or anxious, check to see what you are thinking, where is <br/>\nyour mind directed?<br/>\nHow often do you use blaming language (You are making me so _____)?<br/>\nWhen you blame others, you are giving up your control (of yourself).<br/>\n<br/>\nI caught myself using blaming language more often than I expected <br/>\nand have been working hard to own my feelings and accept them. <br/>\nStrangely, I could accept my kids having big feelings, but was <br/>\npunishing myself whenever I got overwhelmed by similar emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 2: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>\nReason: what you focus on you get more of<br/>\n<br/>\nPay Attention to your focus. Are you focusing on what you want or on <br/>\nwhat you dont want?&quot; When you are upset, it is almost always because <br/>\nyou are focusing on what you DO NOT want!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am constantly trying to frame things in terms of what I DO want <br/>\nnow. I hadn&#39;t realized how often I said &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t want this&quot;, etc. I was priming myself to feel BAD. It <br/>\nis hard for me sometimes to even come up with a positive statement <br/>\nwhen I am getting overwhelmed. I am working so hard to pay attention <br/>\nand make this change. It does work. Changing what I focus on is <br/>\nchanging my attitude and my actions. I feel like I can set a more <br/>\npositive example for my kids now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 3: Harnessing the Power of Free Will <br/>\nReason: The only person you can make change is yourself<br/>\n<br/>\nChange your &quot;shoulds&quot; to &quot;coulds&quot;; Then make a choice and live with <br/>\nit. Instead of saying I &quot;should&quot; go to the store or I &quot;should&quot; write <br/>\nthose thank-you cards, say I &quot;could&quot; do _______, and then choose. It <br/>\nis free will. YOU have the right to choose what to do.<br/>\nAllow others to have their own thoughts and feelings. Pay attention <br/>\nto what you feel when people disagree with you. (Most of us feel <br/>\nthreatened). <br/>\n<br/>\nI lived in a world of &quot;shoulds&quot;- guilt self-imposed that I put at <br/>\nthe feet of my mother or grandmother. I willingly felt bad for not <br/>\ndoing what &quot;they&quot; wanted. I feel so much more powerful and in <br/>\ncontrol since I have been owning my actions. Many times I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ncomplete a task because it became this huge albatross of obligation <br/>\nand sucked away any of my desire to do it. I have felt more <br/>\nindependent and strong since I have been choosing my actions instead <br/>\nof trying to make other people happy at my own expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 4: Harnessing the Power of unity<br/>\nReason: to focus on connecting instead of trying to be special<br/>\n<br/>\nTake five minutes or more, daily and &quot;just be&quot; with each of your <br/>\nchildren. Put aside any agenda, and simply enjoy their company. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis one wasn&#39;t too powerful for me, but I am with them almost 24/7, <br/>\nso 5 minutes sounds ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 5: Harnessing the Power of Love<br/>\nReason: to see the best in one another<br/>\n<br/>\nWish People Well. Do this silently from your heart when you are <br/>\nstanding in lines, driving, or passing people as you walk. Give this <br/>\ngift to everyone you see. Notice how you feel when you do this.<br/>\nBegin each day being grateful for at least three things. Before you <br/>\ngo to bed, tell all your family members how thankful you are for <br/>\ntheir presence in your life. Notice what this does for your energy <br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where the idea of attributing the best possible intentions <br/>\nto a child was covered. I think I do pretty well with this one. <br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 6: Harnessing the power of Acceptance<br/>\nReason: this moment is as it is<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a big one. She talked about not making blanket statements <br/>\nlike &quot;we don&#39;t hit in this house&quot; after someone has just hit. You <br/>\ndeny the present by making such statements. Accept what is, AS IT IS!<br/>\nMake choices based on what IS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often fall back on how things &quot;should&quot; be. I was raised in a very <br/>\npunishment/reward centered home and learned that if I did A, then <br/>\nB &quot;should&quot; happen. I have found myself dissapointed a great deal <br/>\nwhen what I expected and wanted didn&#39;t happen. I am working on <br/>\naccepting things as they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Practice being peaceful in the moment by noticing things and <br/>\ndescribing what you see, without judgements. Notice the weather, <br/>\nplants outdoors, shadows, smells and sounds.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Add a ritual to your childs bedtime routine that involves saying <br/>\ngoodnight to her body parts. for example, Im going to say goodnight <br/>\nto your ears (touch the ears) your chin, elbows.....&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has helped me be more present and focus on just enjoying my <br/>\nkids and making up our own special time at night instead of focusing <br/>\non trying to get them to sleep as fast as possible. As a side <br/>\nbenefit, we are all happier and they do fall asleep more easily. (I <br/>\nam sure they felt my fatigue and desire for them to sleep before and <br/>\nI was probably noticibly &quot;going through the motions&quot; My kids are 2 <br/>\nand 3 1/2, so I do help them wind down at night (when they are ready)<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude Shift 7: Harnessing the Power of Attention<br/>\nReason: Conflict offers an opportunity to teach<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever conflict arises, breathe deeply and remind <br/>\nyourself &quot;conflict is an opportunity to teach and learn&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on Responding to conflict rather than trying to eliminate it.<br/>\nTHIS is probably the most important thing I could have read!<br/>\nMy kids are only 18 months apart and we have conflicts fairly <br/>\nregularly. I was raised in a family where my main objective was to <br/>\navoid conflict at all cost. It is a scary place for me to be <br/>\nemotionally and I was trying to get my kids to &quot;just get along&quot; and <br/>\nnot seeing the benefit to all of us in their inherent struggles.<br/>\nNow I am working on handling my emotions and helping them find ways <br/>\nto get what they want. They seem to be better at it than me :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this was a super long post, but I though maybe more info. <br/>\nwould help show WHAT, in particular, I liked about the book. I am <br/>\nstill early in this unschooling journey and most of my time is spent <br/>\nbecoming a better person for myself and hopfully making some of <br/>\nthese ideas second nature for my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these ideas are all obvious to you, be GLAD!<br/>\nI have been changing a great deal since reading this book because it <br/>\njust wasn&#39;t obvious to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKiersten</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59971551,"authorName":"David & Annelise Pierce","from":"David & Annelise Pierce &lt;ddpierce@...&gt;","profile":"ddpierce2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] messages from books","postDate":"1123271131","msgId":107696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJGMTkzQTFDLjE0MTZGJWRkcGllcmNlQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5OS40NDg3NDRkNC4zMDI1MTU4MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107694,"nextInTopic":107698,"prevInTime":107695,"nextInTime":107697,"topicId":107688,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On 8/5/05 3:18 PM, SandraDodd@aol.com  wrote: Okay, Sandra¹s consistent message about this is slowly wearing me down from my original","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-843097636\"><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">On 8/5/05 3:18 PM, &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, Sandra¹s consistent message about this is slowly wearing me down from<br/>\nmy original position (you don¹t want to hear it!!)

It&#39;s not necessary to put<br/>\n&gt; all the <br/>\n&gt; book in, because a lot can be expressed by faces, eyes, gestures, posture,<br/>\n&gt; glances, etc.   Some of that doesn&#39;t translate to these discussions, though, I<br/>\n&gt; know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m not a verbal person; I am.   But in a case of hurt<br/>\n&gt; feelings and extricating a child from the act of cookie swiping or toy<br/>\n&gt; grabbing, I <br/>\n&gt; think &quot;Wait&quot; and a significant look or touch can do more than explanation.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe, in that moment, he&#39;ll realize what he&#39;s doing and put the item down and<br/>\n&gt; think of a better course of action right then and there, and then it will be<br/>\n&gt; his.   Maybe he&#39;ll look at the mom in a &quot;huh?&quot; kind of way and by then she&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; have had a couple of seconds to think of the best two or five word follow-on.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Wait a while&quot; or &quot;There are more in the fridge&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s find another one.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s my long years of focus on learning instead of teaching.   If every<br/>\n&gt; instance calls up a mini-lecture on the principles involved, by the time that<br/>\n&gt; child is a few years older, the mom speeches will be like the wallpaper.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I like the idea that moms should think of saying &quot;NO&quot; as though the child<br/>\n&gt; comes with 200 tickets at birth.   Some moms use them all up the first year<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; the child ignores &quot;no&quot; forever after.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s the same with speeches.   Save them for the big stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Helping children learn seems to require fewer words than teaching children<br/>\n&gt; what.    All they can do is learn anyway.   If they feel the mom owns it all,<br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be theirs.   Their &quot;good decisions&quot; will become obedience, or being a<br/>\n&gt; mama&#39;s yes-boy.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have tried to instill my voice in my children&#39;s heads, no denying that, but<br/>\n&gt; I want it to be the voice of reason and humor and &quot;wait, think&quot; and for their<br/>\n&gt; mom messages to be short and useful, not droning with a big &quot;off&quot; switch next<br/>\n&gt; to them.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I simply meant to say that Bailey&#39;s philosophy of<br/>\n&gt; attributing a positive motivation to behavior has been a fruitful idea<br/>\n&gt; for us.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can you give us examples of that in your own real life, from your own<br/>\n&gt; experience?

Their &quot;good decisions&quot; will become obedience, or being a <br/>\nmama&#39;s yes-boy.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to instill my voice in my children&#39;s heads, no denying that, but <br/>\nI want it to be the voice of reason and humor and &quot;wait, think&quot; and for their <br/>\nmom messages to be short and useful, not droning with a big &quot;off&quot; switch next <br/>\nto them.    <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I simply meant to say that Bailey&#39;s philosophy of<br/>\nattributing a positive motivation to behavior has been a fruitful idea<br/>\nfor us.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you give us examples of that in your own real life, from your own <br/>\nexperience?

And certainly we don&#39;t <br/>\nuse that syrupy tone. Sometimes we use a very strong, admiring tone, <br/>\nvery spontaneously, if our son&#39;s actions suggest that he is feeling <br/>\nvery strongly about something. Our &quot;wow&quot;s can be quite sincere! What it <br/>\nfeels like to me is trying to recognize that a child is trying to meet <br/>\na legitimate need, and also (for little ones) helping to give them the <br/>\nlanguage for their various feelings and needs. It also has to do with <br/>\nrecognizing that kids may not have all the information we do--one of <br/>\nBailey&#39;s examples is of a kid hoarding his birthday cupcakes, who might <br/>\nsimply not have any idea they weren&#39;t all meant for him, a piece of <br/>\ninformation grownups take for granted but that might not be obvious to <br/>\na child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably could have thought of better examples; I didn&#39;t mean to <br/>\nsuggest that it&#39;s OK at our house for a kid to grab things that belong <br/>\nto others. We have encouraged our older son to think before acting--if <br/>\nthe baby is grabbing something away, not to grab back but to take a <br/>\nmoment and figure out how to get it back without snatching or hitting, <br/>\nand to ask a grownup for help if he needs it. And he&#39;s pretty good at <br/>\nthat. Solutions like you mention, such as, &quot;Can we find another one for <br/>\nyou?&quot; or &quot;Would you like me to help you find something else to play <br/>\nwith while you wait for him to be done with that?&quot; are very common at <br/>\nour house, too.
