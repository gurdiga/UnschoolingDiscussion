She said she <br/>\nwanted book spelling, so I also edited for her as I went along. We now have <br/>\ntwo notebooks full of her writing.

I thought she was too young to read having read so much on the Waldorf system. I then realized she really did want to have the skills to read and we started playing with the letters all over the place. Words are everywhere. One thing she really liked was to dictate a short, very short story. Sometimes just a sentence or two. I would write the story into a small book. 1 peice of paper cut into pieces stapled together. She liked little books. She would then read her story to everyone. I remember her calling her gramma 3 times one day to read her book. She got so much confidence having made the book, written the story and illustrating them. Not Bob books for her, they were Ashley books. I have her little books stashed away and we look at them once in a while. By 5 she was reading most easy readers from the library. At 6, Harry Potter on her own, and fast too. She is fully literate and reads books constantly. I sure am glad I learned to listen to her and gave her the skills at 4 to read instead of listening to the experts I was reading who told me to play doll and fairy with her. Ashley loves books. She is 8 now and exploring the public school system, her choice. I&#39;m trusting she will get what she wants from this new interest and move on, I mean back home again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59318,"nextTopicId":59267}}
