A couple of years ago, my girlfriend and I were on the phone <br/>\nwhile my husband was shaving next to me.

They laughed so hard I almost felt like a kid and wanted to cry! <br/>\nLOL  They STILL say cheekbrow and roar with laughter every time they say it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, I just love to be the butt of their jokes.  :/<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Funny kid quips was: Re: imagination/reality","postDate":"1053883271","msgId":70698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjI3MUdzTUkwTjRtdEUwMDAzMTgwZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70666,"nextInTopic":70807,"prevInTime":70697,"nextInTime":70699,"topicId":70666,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-930005803\">&lt;&lt;No way!

I can just imagine!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time, when we were driving around, this woman kept cutting me off and <br/>\nslowing down almost to a stop in front of me.  I mistakenly called her a <br/>\nbitch under my breath...or so I thought.  We finally got around her and <br/>\nabout 10 minutes later, ended up next to her at a stoplight.  Just as we <br/>\nstopped, Haleigh (then 19 months old) yells out, &quot;There&#39;s the bitch Momma!  <br/>\nThere&#39;s the bitch!  Look Momma, I see the bitch again!&quot;  It was summer, all <br/>\nthe windows were down, including the &#39;bitch&#39;es windows.  She heard it all.  <br/>\nIt didn&#39;t help that Haleigh was pointing *right* at her!  It was terrible <br/>\nbecause we were laughing so hard we couldn&#39;t just ignore it and hope it <br/>\nwould go away.  The harder we laughed, the more Haleigh yelled it.  Ugh! LOL <br/>\n  I can only imagine what she thought of us!  Haleigh was teeny tiny for her <br/>\nage and talked like crazy.
