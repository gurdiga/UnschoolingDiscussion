We&#39;re <br/>\ntalking about seeing Master and Commander this afternoon.  I was asking him <br/>\nwhat the technology was then, as to guns.  It&#39;s 1805, so slightly post American <br/>\nRevolution, but what advances were there?  He talked about rifle stocks, but <br/>\nI seriously doubt the British Navy issued rifles to seamen.

Things like transportation, tactics, motivation <br/>\nof enlistees (makes a difference), means of communication, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just realized that Friday night during the party there was a conversation <br/>\nabout the U.S. Civil War being the last war fought with Napoleonic strategies, <br/>\nand about that war being notable for some changes and some hold-out traditions <br/>\n(which weren&#39;t used thereafter).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was cleaning the kitchen, and not really much into that conversation, but <br/>\nmy contribution was &quot;Photography!
