Of these, the most important is that all students<br/>\nlearn best and most quickly when self-interest orients and drives the<br/>\nsearch for information, understanding, and skill.  This is equally true<br/>\nof infants, young children, adolescents, and younger and older adults,<br/>\nand it applies equally, without respect to assessments of mental<br/>\ncapacity.  What this means, if Sarason is right, is that any student<br/>\nwho chose spontaneously and voluntarily, on the basis of his or her own<br/>\ninclinations and experience, to become a brain surgeon could probably<br/>\nprepare adequately to enter that career by the age of twenty if those<br/>\nin a position to support that ambition provided the necessary<br/>\nassistance or at least did not stand in the way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--from The Hand: How Its Use Shapes the Brain, Language, and Human<br/>\nCulture, by Frank R.
