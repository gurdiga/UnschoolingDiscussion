Anyone been through this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup!  On both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my ex and I split up, we had a verbal agreement that he would take the <br/>\nolder and I the younger until the younger was old enough to go back and <br/>\nforth in a joint custody arrangement.  Once he had our daughter, though, he <br/>\ndecided that he didn&#39;t want to do joint custody because it would mean <br/>\nhaving to communicate with me too much.  Instead of going straight to a <br/>\nlawyer, I stupidly asked my welfare worker about it.  She told me that once <br/>\nhe had her, I would have to prove him an unfit parent to get her back.  He <br/>\nwas perfectly willing to sacrifice time with Noah over the years in order <br/>\nto keep me from seeing Heather any more than he had to let me.  He used to <br/>\npick horrible battles with me in front of the kids before I learned which <br/>\nbuttons he was pushing and managed to disconnect them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe forced me to put Noah back in school after I homeschooled him for a year <br/>\nand a half.  I was 8 months pregnant and Noah didn&#39;t want me to fight <br/>\nanymore.  A year after that, he moved in with his dad, since he had to go <br/>\nto school anyway.  (I had stupidly thought that a new baby, going back to <br/>\nschool, and having his step-sister with us full time for the first time <br/>\nwould be easy for him to manage....big oops.)  At that time, I told both <br/>\nthe kids that they could come and see me whenever they wanted.  They just <br/>\nhad to arrange it with their dad.  (They were living about half an hour <br/>\naway from me.)  Taking myself out of the picture made it much easier for <br/>\nthem to negotiate with their dad for time with me.  As they moved into and <br/>\nthrough their teens, they gradually started just making their own plans for <br/>\nvisiting me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband had similar difficulties with his ex.  When they were about to <br/>\nsplit up, he took his daughter camping for a couple of weeks.  He told his <br/>\nex what he was doing and when he&#39;d be back, but she went to court and lied, <br/>\nsaying that he abducted Emily.  When he came back, she told him about a <br/>\ncourt hearing too late for him to attend.  We used to have to take Emily <br/>\nback to her mother&#39;s house screaming that she didn&#39;t want to go see her <br/>\nmummy.  It was awful.  The year Emily was starting kindergarten, she was <br/>\nsupposed to come and live with us for the year.  I had taken her to the <br/>\nkindergarten get acquainted day in the spring, and she was all set to start <br/>\nschool here.  The night before school started, her mother took her for <br/>\ndinner to her mother&#39;s house.  At least that&#39;s what she said she was <br/>\ndoing.  Actually she took her back to her own house, then called to say <br/>\nthat she&#39;d changed her mind and Emily would be staying there that year.  We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get her full time until grade 3.  The hassles went on for years like <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help at all with your situation, we&#39;d need to know things like how far <br/>\naway the girl lives, whether she&#39;s allowed to call when she wants to, how <br/>\nmuch time she actually does spend with her dad, stuff like that.  Obviously <br/>\nit&#39;s harder to arrange if the girl lives far away.  If she&#39;s close and <br/>\nshe&#39;s 16, I would tell her to come when she wants to, that she&#39;s welcome <br/>\nany time, and let her work it out with her mother.  Even if she lives <br/>\nfarther away, it could still work out.  Most 16 year olds wouldn&#39;t put up <br/>\nwith that unless the mother has poisoned the girl&#39;s mind against him.  If <br/>\nshe has, about the only thing he can do is to keep trying to be in touch <br/>\nwith her, including letting her know that she can phone collect anytime and <br/>\nvisit whenever her mother lets her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t put his ex down in front of the girl, and makes efforts to <br/>\nstay in touch with her, I think his daughter is likely to end up reasonably <br/>\nclose to her once she&#39;s grown.  I know that all that poisoning my ex did to <br/>\nmy relationship with Heather has backfired on him big time.  She and I are <br/>\nreally close, and she&#39;s very close to shutting him out of her life yet <br/>\nagain.  (He&#39;s trying to pull something very similar with my granddaughter now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of this helps.  Ask away if you have more questions.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] ex-wives","postDate":"1009683397","msgId":30403,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMjMwMDMzNi5mQlUzYWlQNDAwNzYwM0BueWNzbXRwMW91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":30402,"nextInTopic":30404,"prevInTime":30402,"nextInTime":30404,"topicId":30401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
