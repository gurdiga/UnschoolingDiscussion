Turns out there was an ambulance and<br/>\npolice cars in our side yard and he was worried<br/>\nsomething had happened to me or dd. We didn&#39;t hear<br/>\nanything at all! We looked out the window and saw that<br/>\nthe neighbors (whose house is only the width of a<br/>\ndriveway from ours) had a stretcher in front of their<br/>\nporch. We watched for a while, nosy, you know how it<br/>\nis, and started to feel relieved, thinking that they<br/>\nmust be ok, since the ambulance people weren&#39;t in a<br/>\nhurry to bring them out to the stretcher.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no. Out came a body bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, ds, who is 10, saw this. His first body bag. MY<br/>\nfirst body bag! The house is a duplex, so we weren&#39;t<br/>\nsure if it was the upstairs people, whom we know, or<br/>\nthe downstairs guy, who owns the house. We called<br/>\nanother neighbor, who said she, too, had been freaked<br/>\nout thinking it was for our house. She said she saw<br/>\nthe upstairs people looking out the window, so she was<br/>\nsure it wasn&#39;t them. So she called them (she has their<br/>\nnumber because they shovel her driveway)and they told<br/>\nher it was their landlord downstairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a corner store here, and the dead man used to<br/>\ngo there every day. When he didn&#39;t come in for a few<br/>\ndays and his car didn&#39;t move, the corner store people<br/>\nasked the upstairs people (when they were out walking<br/>\ntheir dog) if they knew what was up. So the upstairs<br/>\npeople knocked, waited a day, knocked again, and then<br/>\ncalled the police, who, of course, found him dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ghostly part of this story is that dd and I have<br/>\nhad insomnia all week. Very bad insomnia. And every<br/>\ntime we&#39;d fall asleep, the cat, who also seemed to<br/>\nhave insomnia, would come along and yowl us awake,<br/>\nwhich is unusual for him. Ds wasn&#39;t affected, but his<br/>\nroom is not in that part of the house, and dh was out<br/>\nof town. Dd was sleeping with me, as she does when dh<br/>\nis out of town, and my bedroom is, like I say, a<br/>\ndriveway width from his bedroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still don&#39;t know how he died, but a little while<br/>\nafterwards, I remembered he had a cat. So I called the<br/>\nanimal control officer and let him know. He said an<br/>\nofficer was going back to the house right then, so he<br/>\nwould look for the cat. A while later, the neighbor<br/>\nI&#39;d talked to on the phone called to say a cat was<br/>\ncarried out, so we stopped worrying about the cat.<br/>\nWell, except for thinking about it being locked up in<br/>\nthe house for a week with its dead/dying person.<br/>\n<br/>\nDs had a sleepover last night, so I don&#39;t know yet if<br/>\nhe had bad dreams or other problems after seeing the<br/>\nbody bag. But he seemed ok, more disturbed from the<br/>\nshock of thinking it was us than from seeing the<br/>\nclosed body bag of someone he didn&#39;t know. Actually,<br/>\nhis only contact with the man was when he yelled at ds<br/>\nfor playing on what&#39;s technically his property, though<br/>\nthree yards merge there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s my contribution to the ghostliness. Am I<br/>\nbeing melodramatic to think our insomnia and the cat&#39;s<br/>\nyowling had to do with this?
