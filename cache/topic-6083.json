It<br/>\nwas down to shreds when I found it again at www.iloveadeal.com, on sale,<br/>\njust recently, although I think I have seen it in a T-shirt shop somewhere,<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, no I don&#39;t particularly miss those days, although I do have many fond<br/>\nmemories.  I am glad my kids have an atmosphere of more people knowing about<br/>\nhome/unschooling, even if they don&#39;t always have an accurate view or agree,<br/>\nand just generally having more information readily available than I did.  I<br/>\nwas working in the dark most of the time, knowing in my heart this was<br/>\nright, but unaware of just how incredible it would turn out to be.  My<br/>\nchildren are much more aware of what they are working toward and options<br/>\navailable as they home/unschool their own kids and doing a beautiful job!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Most of the other hs&#39;ing families we met early on in person were Fundies<br/>\nand we had such strong philosophical differences that they seemed as weird<br/>\nto us as I am sure we seemed to them.  By the time we came to Oklahoma, I<br/>\nwas beginning to feel that others within the homeschooling community were<br/>\nfar greater threats to our right to homeschool in the way that best fit our<br/>\nfamily than anyone outside could be, so we were fairly isolated in<br/>\nhomeschooling, just doing the things that worked for us.  We did meet other<br/>\nfamilies here who respected individual ways of hs&#39;ing, and formed<br/>\nfriendships, but still continued on our own way day to day.  I appreciate<br/>\nhaving, for myself as well as my kids, the communication that the internet<br/>\nprovides, as well as a growing number of homeschoolers everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Beth Burnham&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beth2002@...\">beth2002@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If Mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t nobody happy!&quot;  And that<br/>\n&gt; is true!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandi where can I get that T-shirt?
