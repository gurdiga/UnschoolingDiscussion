As a child, if he <br/>\nwas playing outside and a car DROVE by, he would run and hide so no one <br/>\nwould see him and stay in that position for hours at a time.  He&#39;s come a <br/>\nlong way.  If he has to interact with people in a business situation, he <br/>\ndoes ok but in personal interactions, such as meeting people in a friendly <br/>\nsituation, he has a very hard time dealing with it.  This even extended into <br/>\nhis relationship with our children and he is only now feeling comfortable <br/>\nwhen they want to hug him.  For a long time, when they tried to hug him, he <br/>\nwould pat them on the back and stiffen up.  I think having the kids has <br/>\nbrought him out more than anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is really uncomfortable about going to the SC conference because he feels <br/>\n&quot;fake&quot; when he has to meet and greet.  Over the years, we&#39;ve tried small <br/>\ngatherings of a few people but for some reason, the larger crowds tend to be <br/>\nbetter for him.  We were told that in the larger crowds, he feels less of a <br/>\nneed to interact in a personal or emotional way.  Basically, he can meet <br/>\nhundreds of people that he knows he will never see again and he is able to <br/>\ndeal with that.  It actually makes sense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part is I am extremely outgoing and gregarious.  I talk to <br/>\nanyone and everyone.  Drives him crazy! LOL  I really have to like his <br/>\ntherapist though...he hasn&#39;t gone since just after we were married...because <br/>\nhe told Chris that having me for a wife would cure him before any therapy <br/>\nsession.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just got off the phone with him to see if he minded me writing all this <br/>\nabout him to people he might actually meet someday. &lt;g&gt;)  His comment on my <br/>\nlast sentence....&#39;because he told Chris that having me for a wife would cure <br/>\nhim before any therapy session&#39;......was, &quot;yeah, isn&#39;t THAT the truth!&quot;  LOL <br/>\n  Not sure how heartfelt that one was. &lt;bg&gt;  We got a good laugh out of it <br/>\nthough!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"tmthomas@shaw.ca","from":"tmthomas@...","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Frustrated w/DH & homeschooling","postDate":"1052838996","msgId":68874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjZmZmMjA3YzMuMjA3YzMxY2ZmZkBzaGF3LmNhPg=="},"prevInTopic":68858,"nextInTopic":68892,"prevInTime":68873,"nextInTime":68875,"topicId":68813,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think Kathryn has it - that s how I got involved - took time to trust that this could work.

I<br/>\nguess God thought I wasn&#39;t frustrated enough.....he decided to throw<br/>\nthat into the mix. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH and I had a sort of fight tonight and I need some help on how to<br/>\nspeak to him about homeschooling. He says that he is all for<br/>\nhomeschooling Karen and that he does not want her to go to public<br/>\nschool. But, I think that if I told him tomorrow that I wanted her to<br/>\ngo to public school, he would say that was fine as well. His biggest<br/>\nproblem with homeschooling has always been that he doesn&#39;t think she<br/>\nwill get to socialize enough with other kids. So (not only for him<br/>\nbut, for me and my dd as well) I joined a local homeschooling group<br/>\nthat meets once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny time I mention getting together at parties or field trips that<br/>\nthey go on, he backs out. For example....there is a camp out in July<br/>\nthat is only about 1/2 hour from us (sounded like fun to me). I told<br/>\nhim tonight that I would like to go (even though DD is only 2) so that<br/>\nwe can start to get to know the local homeschoolers and he does not<br/>\nwant to go. His reasoning (if you can call if that) is that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to go because he doesn&#39;t know anyone! I asked him how he<br/>\nthought we were going to get to know anyone if we never went to these<br/>\nthings to get to know people?! He didn&#39;t really have an answer except<br/>\nthat he has only ever camped with family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m hoping you all might be able to help me. If nothing else,<br/>\nlet me know that I&#39;m not the only one with a spouse who isn&#39;t as open<br/>\nminded as he says he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68922,"nextTopicId":68950}}
