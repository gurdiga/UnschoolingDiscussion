Sounds real interesting.  &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have use of a nice community center every Wed. from 10a-1p. There is a <br/>\nlarge Gymn with Basketball hoops, a stage, a room with Tv/VCR and long tables <br/>\nwhere the Yugio/Mage Knight fans congregate. A dance room has space for <br/>\nanything else they want to do, we bring blocks, brio train track, plastic <br/>\nbugs/lizards/bats etc... for the younger ones, have parties, play games, <br/>\nshare interests, play music on their sound system, barter, do art/craft <br/>\nprojects (the floor is tile, so easy clean up) cook etc..<br/>\nAnything goes.<br/>\nAnd the best part is the community center has a wonderful park with picnic <br/>\nbenches and it&#39;s right on the BAY. A HUGE dock is right next to the center <br/>\nand the kids run up and down chasing seagulls and often end up splashing at <br/>\nthe waters edge or mucking about for fish, watching fishermen etc...<br/>\nIt&#39;s really awesome and I think we&#39;ve influenced a few folks to really think <br/>\nabout unschooling in a whole new way.<br/>\nWe are the only truly inclusive group that I know of and we get all the most <br/>\ninteresting and open minded folks in Pensacola!! For the most part anyway....<br/>\n:)<br/>\nAND, we&#39;re hosting the first ever LIFE (Learning In Freedom Everyday) <br/>\nFunFest. It&#39;s a mini-conference with speakers (local only), vendors and <br/>\nworkshops all day.<br/>\nWe&#39;re really excited!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58764,"nextTopicId":58826}}
