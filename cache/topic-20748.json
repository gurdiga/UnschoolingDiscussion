I find it interesting<br/>\n&gt; when people start putting down another group because<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t agree with their stand on an issue, instead<br/>\n&gt; of just letting them have a different view.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When a person strongly believes that spanking harms children, she can&#39;t just<br/>\naccept it as &quot;a different view&quot;. It&#39;s not me saying peas are better than<br/>\ncarrots and you disagreeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, when a person strongly believes that the Bible is mandating that<br/>\nshe use a rod, strike, hit, spank or whatever her children, she can&#39;t just<br/>\naccept me saying I don&#39;t spank my children. If she thinks the Bible leaves<br/>\nthe choice, she can accept my statement, but if she is of the opinion that<br/>\nit&#39;s ordained, she holds the opinion that I harm my children by NOT<br/>\nspanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are the shades of gray -- &quot;spanking is okay if it&#39;s a danger<br/>\nthing&quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, in a spanking debate (as in an abortion debate, a religion<br/>\ndebate, etc.) few minds will be changed, but it&#39;s those few minds that are<br/>\nimportant to anyone who has strongly held beliefs, on either side of the<br/>\nissue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s wrong to spank children. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever right, for any<br/>\nreason. I think there is always a better way. So, IMHO, the woman who wrote<br/>\nabout wisdom in one area or another is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nCare should be taken with the language, though. You write &quot;unwise parents&quot;<br/>\nas though that is what the original poster said. Just as a child who does<br/>\none stupid thing is not a stupid child, a parent who does one unwise thing<br/>\nis not an unwise parent. It takes an accumulation, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20065,"nextTopicId":20749}}
