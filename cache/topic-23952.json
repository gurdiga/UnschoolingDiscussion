We have been homeschooling for 9 years. I <br/>\nam the editor and publisher of The Edgy-catin&#39; Mama, a zine that <br/>\nexplores the side of homeschooling you seldom hear about in the more <br/>\nmainstream publications...first issue is free if anyone is interested <br/>\nand I am always looking for submissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe began homeschooling when my son was in first grade after he was <br/>\ndiagnosed with rather severe dyslexia. We have continued for a <br/>\nvariety of reasons, too numerous to mention.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is something that we kind of fell into. It seems to fit <br/>\nour family quite well, although I will admit we do panic every now <br/>\nand then and do the math worksheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in the country with 3 dogs, 6 cats, 10 rescued parrots, 3 <br/>\nguinea pigs, 8 rabbits and 2 hermit crabs...can you guess what our <br/>\nhomeschooling revolves around? <br/>\nI am looking forward to meeting everyone!<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nNina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1848,"nextTopicId":23958}}
