Kirby was staying with a girl <br/>\nhe&#39;d met at an anime convention three years ago, and he&#39;s visited the group of <br/>\nDenver-kids he met there another time before.  (The rest of us were elsewhere <br/>\ndoing elsewhat.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had a group of friends like Kirby has a group of friends.  Most of <br/>\ntheirs are high school seniors.  Most of Kirby&#39;s is homeschoolers.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing he did was play Magic at the girl&#39;s house, with her deck.  She had <br/>\ntwo decks and asked if he knew how to play.  He said sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe reported all this on the way home.  He said they played with 80 cards <br/>\ninstead of 60 and instead of playing one card at a time, they started with seven <br/>\ncards and played five at a time.  She assured him that all the kids at her <br/>\nschool play it that way.  He went along with it.  He said once she said, &quot;You work <br/>\nat a gaming store and you didn&#39;t know that rule?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe kinda laughed and said he had only said, &quot;Oh; my bad,&quot; and played it her <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it&#39;s not that he&#39;s intimidated by her, nor was he trying to put the make <br/>\non her.  He was just trying to be friendly and play her &quot;house rules&quot; to be a <br/>\ngood guest.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day another friend of hers was over and he was invited to play.  He said, <br/>\n&quot;I could beat you if I had my own deck,&quot; and said a couple of things that <br/>\ncaused Kirby to believe he was current on Magic-the-Real-Game.  So Kirby said <br/>\n&quot;She has some weird rules,&quot; and left it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him at what point did he admit to her that he proctors/judges Magic <br/>\ntournaments?   He said he didn&#39;t.    I asked if he had worn any of his Magic <br/>\nshirts.  He said no, he had just taken solid-color T&#39;s and &quot;Make 7 / UP Yours.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it will embarrass her someday when she knows, but he can be pretty <br/>\ncharming and will probably soothe the awkwardness.  She wants to come and visit <br/>\nhere next summer, with another of the kids they hung out with up there, or two.  <br/>\nShe owns a hearse and wants to road trip down and hang out with Kirby here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf of Kirby&#39;s t-shirt wardrobe consists of black t-shirts he has been given <br/>\nwhen he worked at a Magic Tournament.  There are pre-release tournaments <br/>\n(where participants get cards which aren&#39;t yet for general sale) and regional <br/>\ntournaments (where kids come from several states around and the shop rents a big <br/>\nhall of some sort for it) and Kirby has the t-shirts to document two years of <br/>\nthis work.   They say &quot;Staff&quot;  on them.  I think one says &quot;Judge.&quot;  There are a <br/>\ndozen, at least, with large Magic-card art on the back and logo-fronts and <br/>\ncompany sleeves sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he didn&#39;t reveal any of this to his hostess, and he played her way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point they went to a movie.  She and two friends, both he said dressed <br/>\ndramatically goth-like.  And Kirby was wearing yellow pants.  There was a <br/>\nskating rink in the place where the theater was, and two hockey-players, sticks <br/>\nin hand (no skates, I presume &lt;g&gt;) taunted the boys.  &quot;Go back to the circus&quot; <br/>\nor something.   One of the girls was encouraging the boys to respond in kind, <br/>\nand Kirby said (sweetly and laughingly, the way he reported it to us), &quot;They <br/>\nhave sticks.  They could kick our asses!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a hockey player on skates could kick Kirby&#39;s butt.  I think Kirby <br/>\ncould disarm a hockey player on solid ground, because he&#39;s studied Japanese <br/>\nweapons for years (not sword, but bo and karate-related stuff).  If Kirby got the <br/>\nstick, the hockey guy might be in trouble.  He didn&#39;t mention that to any of <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy interpretation is a guess, but I think he&#39;s confident enough that he can <br/>\nimpress them without bragging that he found no need to defend  or inflate <br/>\nhimself, even when it wouldn&#39;t have been any exaggeration at all to just casually <br/>\nmention what he does regularly at home.   He met them through his interest in <br/>\nanime, which is his third or fourth interest, and let them think there wasn&#39;t <br/>\nmuch more to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was impressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92300,"nextTopicId":92307}}
