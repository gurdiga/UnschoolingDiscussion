I&#39;d like to share a quote from the introduction that I <br/>\nreally liked (and may hang on my fridge.)<br/>\n  &quot;But each night, as I became more firmly grounded in motherhood, I came to <br/>\nknow that there would seldom be life-or-death choices I would be called upon <br/>\nto make in order to protect her from all the kinds of pain that visit humans. <br/>\nInstead, there would be a myriad of small choices I would need to make day in <br/>\nand day out that would help mold her into the person she would eventually <br/>\nturn out to be. I came to understand that it would be the small choices in <br/>\nparenting that would really and truly matter- the choices that there are <br/>\nhundreds of every single day when you have a child.&quot; (end quote)<br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\nE-mail me for a list of used <br/>\nhomeschooling books for sale!<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;</a>&gt;Shop:  Usborne Books!&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58974,"nextTopicId":58989}}
