The centers <br/>\nwhere I live only take kids 2yrs+9mos and older and they must be <br/>\npotty trained.  The kids age newborn to 2yrs+8mos, and some up to 4 <br/>\nyears old or not potty trained go to a private home instead of the <br/>\ncenter.

The parents take the child to the <br/>\nprivate home every day, never the center.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was independent for a while before I worked for the center.  The <br/>\nonly advantage I can see to being independent is that you can charge <br/>\nwhat you want, but if a parent ever doesn&#39;t pay or consistently pays <br/>\nlate, you are the one who loses.  A center pays a per diem rate <br/>\nbased on full day or half day but you get paid every Friday no <br/>\nmatter what.  The other good thing about this arrangement is that <br/>\nwelfare vouchers pay much less than the center&#39;s daily rate but the <br/>\ncenter will still pay you the same rate.  Most people on welfare <br/>\nchoose home day care through day care centers because many <br/>\nindependent home day cares won&#39;t accept them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is just something that happens where I live.

So we watched one segment of that and talked together ( eating dinner on our laps in the sitting room). Several other wanted to play the board game Stop Press ( a newsppaer headlines game).

Having a home day care is a great way to bring in extra <br/>\nincome in your home and still be home with your own kids.  My advice <br/>\nwould be to first have an off-limits area for the day care kids <br/>\nwhere your own kids could get away from the day care kids if they <br/>\nwanted.  This could even be their own rooms.  Sometimes your own <br/>\nkids might not want to share and that needs to be ok.  Obviously <br/>\nthey will have to share YOU for a big part of the day every day, but <br/>\nyou could explain that to them before you even start and see how <br/>\nthey feel about it.  The second issue is that it will be much harder <br/>\nto do things during the day with extra kids.  Sure, you could food <br/>\nshop when the day care kids are gone, but if you wanted to go on a <br/>\nfield trip or even to a doctor&#39;s appt, you&#39;d have to take all the <br/>\nkids with you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne positive thing that I did when I did home day care was I worked <br/>\nfor a day care center, rather than independently.  That gave me the <br/>\nfreedom to take a day off because the center would find the parents <br/>\na replacement home for that day.  If you work independently, your <br/>\nparents lose care when you can&#39;t work.  Another reason I liked <br/>\nworking for the center was that I never had to worry about getting <br/>\npaid.  I was paid a paycheck by the center weekly whether or not the <br/>\nparents paid on time.  Another benefit of working for the center was <br/>\nthat they provided me with any equipment that I needed such as high <br/>\nchairs or playpens.  Still another benefit of working with a center <br/>\nis that if you don&#39;t mesh with a certain child, you can tell them <br/>\nand they will remove the child and give you another one.  I had a <br/>\nchild who cried all day long in my house, but they put her with an <br/>\nolder woman who had no other kids in the house and the little girl <br/>\nwas so happy.  She needed the quiet 1:1 which I couldn&#39;t give her.  <br/>\nOn the other hand I was a replacement for a boy who cried all day at <br/>\nhis regular day care home and he never cried at my house except for <br/>\nthe first hour of the first day.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a home day care is a big commitment.  It&#39;s not like working <br/>\nat Burger King where if you quit they replace you the next day and <br/>\nno one notices.  With day care kids, they become attached to you and <br/>\nyour house as if you are one of their family members.  If you quit <br/>\nand they have to go to a new home, you confuse them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI am considering starting a home daycare to supplement our income.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt; dina </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] working moms and unschooling","postDate":"1089821716","msgId":96224,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRjLmYzNzA3MGUuMmUyNmI2MTRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":96223,"nextInTopic":96225,"prevInTime":96223,"nextInTime":96225,"topicId":96223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/14/2004 10:34:03 AM Central Standard Time, dlauzon32@hotmail.com writes: I  am worried if this would adversely affect my 10yo and 8 yo.

I have considered having older kids in after  school, <br/>\nthough.  In your house, with 6 kids if I&#39;m understanding it  right, I guess <br/>\nit&#39;s all about the kids, anyway.  &lt;g&gt;  I  would definitely be looking to keep <br/>\nolder kids and not babies, and  that&#39;s for the babies&#39; sakes as much as yours and <br/>\nyour kids, too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nYou should make sure you check your state laws and have a good idea how  many <br/>\nkids it is legal to keep for money in your home.   <br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as unschooling, are your older kids already feeling like they don&#39;t  <br/>\nget enough time with you?  I can imagine that a 10 yo might be pushing  his/her <br/>\nneeds aside because they can see you are busy with the  toddlers/babies.  <br/>\nThus is the life of the firstborn, but there are and  should be limits.  If that <br/>\nwere the case, I&#39;d be very hesitant.  If  you you are thinking that the older <br/>\nkids would help you with the new kids,  I&#39;d be sure to get their buy-in on <br/>\nthat idea, and make sure they are getting  compensated in some way, too.   You <br/>\nmight have to accept no for an  answer from your olders as well.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I say, check with your 8 and 10 yos and see what they think about the  <br/>\nidea.  Give them an opportunity to give honest feedback, and take it  seriously. <br/>\n Your own kids should come first, of course.  Good luck  with that.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":165113240,"authorName":"dinalauzon","from":"&quot;dinalauzon&quot; &lt;dlauzon32@...&gt;","profile":"dinalauzon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"working moms and unschooling","postDate":"1089768304","msgId":96223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkMjIxZytwcWtqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96224,"prevInTime":96222,"nextInTime":96224,"topicId":96223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How do others handle working a home business or working outside the home and unschooling their kids?
