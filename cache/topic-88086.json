My son is 3 1/2 and doesn&#39;t choose to eat many <br/>\nfruits or veggies.  It depends.  Sometimes he&#39;ll go for cucumbers, tomatoes, and <br/>\ncarrots with dip.  He&#39;ll eat pears, apples, and pineapple, sometimes a banana. <br/>\n I&#39;ve tried all the &quot;tricks&quot;...putting veggies on pizza, etc. (he won&#39;t eat <br/>\nthings unless they are plain so that didn&#39;t work).<br/>\nHis main meals are toast, bagels, PB, tacos, and pancakes/french toast, <br/>\ncheese & yogurt.  That&#39;s about it.  Oh, and he loves sweets like cookies and <br/>\nbrownies(who doesn&#39;t?).  He used to eat pasta, grilled cheese, chicken, but not <br/>\nanymore.<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that if I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, he&#39;ll eat when he&#39;s <br/>\nhungry.  <br/>\nIf I let him he would ask for only cookies, etc so I try not to have those in <br/>\nthe house very often.  If we have them once a week, we eat them until they <br/>\nare gone and then it&#39;s not an issue anymore because there aren&#39;t any left.<br/>\nI asked his dr about it and she said to give him a daily vitamin and not <br/>\nworry about it.<br/>\nI think many people with 3-4 yr olds go through this...try not to worry too <br/>\nmuch and just make healthy choices available.  If I fix a snack and start <br/>\neating it he often comes over and starts munching too (yesterday it was an apple <br/>\nand rice cakes).<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88080,"nextTopicId":87991}}
