I have a 3yr girl and a 16month old <br/>\nson, who are keeping me extremely busy.  I am an Attachment Parenting mother, <br/>\nand and &quot;un-official &quot; unschooler....<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as a reading list....anything by Dr William Sears is great and will <br/>\nprobably suit your taste from what I have read about you.  He has tons of <br/>\nparenting books, like 25 or so...<br/>\nThe Womanly Art of Breastfeeding by La Leche League <br/>\n(LLLI)International...these are just a few of my favorites...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t read anything that has not been approved on the LLLI.  They have a <br/>\nbook list at their site.  If you can&#39;t find it, you can call them for a <br/>\ncatalog or a book list.  It saves me time having to read things that don&#39;t <br/>\nclick with my parenting philosophy....like letting the baby cry it out, or <br/>\nscheduled feedings....<br/>\n<br/>\ncheck out the websites attached to my signature.  They are a great resource...<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Mothering,<br/>\nJulie <br/>\nMommy to Ali and Matthew, Wife to a Great Man, Adam<br/>\nPlease check out a few of my  favorite sites:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com\">http://www.mothering.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.AttachmentParenting.org\">http://www.AttachmentParenting.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LaLecheLeague.org\">http://www.LaLecheLeague.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org\">http://www.naturalchild.org</a><br/>\n&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>\nbeing kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>\n-Peggy O&#39;Mara, Publisher of Mothering Magazine.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12893,"nextTopicId":12937}}
