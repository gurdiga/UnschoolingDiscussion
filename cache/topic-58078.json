The kids know they are allowed<br/>\nto watch what and when they want, so there&#39;s no panic over missed shows,<br/>\netc...<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now Star Wars is on, my son (8) put it on, it&#39;s still on, he&#39;s in<br/>\nhis room building Star Wars inspired Legos.  My daughter (5 1/2) is<br/>\nwatching the movie (for her brother, she says), not her favorite but she<br/>\nlikes Obi Wan.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it&#39;s over we are going on a picnic, then home.  When we get home<br/>\nthe kids will either turn the TV back on, visit with me while I sew, or<br/>\nplay with the neighborhood kids who have some home from school.<br/>\nAnything they choose to do is fine with me.  Including turning the TV<br/>\nback on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to buy into all the &quot;research&quot; about how TV was bad for<br/>\ndeveloping brains.  I don&#39;t believe it anymore.  I&#39;ve seen my children<br/>\nblossom being unschooled (which includes the TV).  I had a one hour<br/>\nrestriction TV the entire time I was growing up, trust me when I say - I<br/>\nnever learned to self regulate the TV!  I&#39;m a junkie when it comes to<br/>\nTV!  Although after more than 20 years without the one hour limit, I&#39;m<br/>\nlearning to self regulate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had weird restrictions on everything in my house, food, candy, milk<br/>\n(!!), TV, books.  You name it, it was probably restricted.  My children<br/>\nhave no restrictions, they are healthier and happier than I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve rambled, thanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho&#39;s TV is still not working!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57909,"nextTopicId":58079}}
