It was actually perfect for him because he loved to read, <br/>\nand basically, thats all it was.  It was recommended to add a math text to <br/>\nthe curriculum and some science, but we didnt do that.  Pretty much, we just <br/>\nadded books to our library that we didnt already have.  They do have a <br/>\n&quot;lesson plan&quot;/ Teacher&#39;s guide, but we never used those.   It would be MUCH <br/>\ncheaper to just borrow the books from the library, but the list they use IS a <br/>\nvery good suggestion for reading.  Ambleside Online also has similar lists of <br/>\nbooks and uses a similar approach.   I just print off the lists and let the <br/>\nkids look at them, or find the books in the library to see if they are <br/>\ninterested.  Anna has found some really good stuff that she has enjoyed that <br/>\nshe probably wouldn&#39;t have known about if we didn&#39;t have &quot;the list&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66086,"nextTopicId":66529}}
