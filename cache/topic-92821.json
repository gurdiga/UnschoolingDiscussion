Alone, playing in the front <br/>\n<br/>\nyard, no mother in sight,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo her mom was in the back yard taking good care of YOUR daughter.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s not an unschooling issue.<br/>\nI&#39;ve found two loose toddlers in my life, and once the mother yelled at me <br/>\nfor having her baby.  Waddly diaper baby, headed for the cattail swamp at the <br/>\nside of the Rio Grande, across a dike road.  I stopped my van, picked the baby <br/>\nup, and walked over to the yard where the mom was hanging out her laundry.  She <br/>\nwas angry.   She wasn&#39;t an unschooler, so who can we blame?  No diaper-baby <br/>\nis &quot;unschooled.&quot;  They&#39;re babies.  So that&#39;s not an unschooling story.<br/>\n<br/>\nA distant relative of mine had a baby crawl up on the train tracks behind her <br/>\nhouse.   Their older kids were in school.  Does that make it a <br/>\nneglect-of-schooled-kids story?  No, the baby was a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find unschoolers who haven&#39;t washed their cars, will you come and <br/>\nlecture us about how stupid it is not to wash a car, therefor unschoolers are <br/>\nstupid?    Thoughtful logic is a really good thing to model for your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-takers her sons in a room to spank them for not watching thier <br/>\n<br/>\nsister. . . Then I learn she unschools.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could share with her this website:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spanking\">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>\nIf she doesn&#39;t have internet access, maybe you could print out some of the <br/>\ngood parts and take them to her.  It could help her children a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of deciding how we will be with our own children is looking at how other <br/>\nmoms are.  That mom will stand as a bad example for you, and probably will <br/>\nintensify your non-spanking and your watchfulness.  That&#39;s good.  You might find <br/>\ngood examples to emulate, too.  But if you decide now what you will believe <br/>\nin ten years, that&#39;s not a good thing.  It could keep you from growing into the <br/>\nbest mom you could be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92671,"nextTopicId":92822}}
