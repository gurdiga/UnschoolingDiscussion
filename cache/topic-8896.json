We have been living in a VERY<br/>\nrural area of VA for the last 3+ years, having moved here from the Charlotte<br/>\narea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up north of Charlotte when we were still able to have horses and my<br/>\ngrandfather had cows and a small farm, so I was somewhat prepared.  The ONLY<br/>\nthing I&#39;ve not become accustomed to is how just going to the grocery store<br/>\nor the library will consume your entire day.  We live about 20 minutes from<br/>\na very small town (1 grocery store) and about 40 minutes from a small city<br/>\nso we drive a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes over an hour to get to a &quot;real&quot; city which is where we do shopping<br/>\nother than Walmart/grocery stuff and where all our doctors are.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I would recommend you think about before moving is to think<br/>\nabout the area you&#39;re moving to in terms of lifestyle.  I don&#39;t know a very<br/>\ntactful way to say this, but it&#39;s very difficult being open-minded and<br/>\nliberal living in a very conservative area.   As I&#39;m sure it would be for a<br/>\nconservative family to move to a overtly liberal community.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of farmers here, but no organic farmers, no health food<br/>\nstores or co-ops.  Everyone is &quot;categorized&quot; by the church they attend.<br/>\nThere is no &quot;sign-up&quot; day for little league, you call the coach & ask to be<br/>\non his team, so naturally there is always &quot;the best&quot; team.  And virtually<br/>\nall of the homeschoolers are conservative, school-at-home Christians.  At<br/>\nleast in the city, or nearer to one, you can find more like-minded<br/>\npeople.....I am the only unschooler here.  Luckily I&#39;ve made a couple of<br/>\nother more liberal friends, homeschoolers who are eclectic and open-minded,<br/>\nbut we are definitely in the minority.  And it&#39;s hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust something else to think about.....good luck with your move.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8893,"nextTopicId":8923}}
