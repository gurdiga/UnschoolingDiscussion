I happen to HAVE<br/>\n&gt; one of those rare beasts - a child who needs more.  More guidance,<br/>\n&gt; more help overcoming his problems, just plain more.  I love him<br/>\n&gt; dearly and I recognized that our unschooling lifestyle was going<br/>\n&gt; sadly awry with him.  That&#39;s why I let my mom take him a few hours<br/>\n&gt; everyday when she offered.  I can&#39;t be that consistent, it is not in<br/>\n&gt; my nature but it was what he needed.

The<br/>\n&gt; glory of unschooling is that the options are there.

But, ok, here&#39;s my<br/>\nresponse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurely a thinking person could allow that there might be a child or two out<br/>\nthere in the world who might not thrive as an unschooler, for one reason or<br/>\nanother.  As a parent, I would want to be watchful for that failure to<br/>\nthrive, just as I would want to be watchful for signs of a physical problem<br/>\nthat might develop with my child regardless of the fact that I have no<br/>\nexpectations that one might develop.  Should I see a problem, I would adjust<br/>\nour learning environment accordingly because my child&#39;s happiness and growth<br/>\nis much more important to me than adherence to a teaching philosophy.  To not<br/>\nallow for this potentiality would make me as rigid and fanatical at my<br/>\nchild&#39;s expense as so many accuse unschoolers of being.  If I did nothing, my<br/>\nchild might fall behind his potential and miss the joy of learning because I<br/>\ninsisted I must unschool at all costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not mean that if my son falls behind some arbitrary standard that he<br/>\nneeds to read at age 5, add three digit numbers at age 7, etc., I&#39;d put him<br/>\non a curriculum immediately.  How sad that this is what you apparently read<br/>\ninto my post.  Congratulations.

Studies are very clear that breastfeeding is best for babies.  One<br/>\ncan make arguments about whether it is best for Mom or not, but there&#39;s no<br/>\ndisagreement--by anyone--that it is best for babies.  Studies have also<br/>\nshown that when a baby is totally breastfed, the benefits are greatest.<br/>\nWhen even a little formula is added, the benefits of the breastmilk they<br/>\n*are* getting is reduced *greatly*.  The formula changes the intestinal<br/>\nflora in the baby and makes it harder for the breast milk to be metabolized<br/>\nin the same way.  It&#39;s still better for baby, but not nearly as good as<br/>\nfully breastfeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell....I think the same is true of unschooling.  If you add a &quot;little seat<br/>\nwork&quot;, it doesn&#39;t just change that part of the day, but it changes the whole<br/>\nenvironment of the learning to change the way learning is processed for the<br/>\nrest of the day.  It changes the relationship between mother and child and<br/>\nbetween child and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m not going to say it must be &quot;either-or&quot; to be &quot;best&quot; for any<br/>\nparticular family....but it does change the relationship so that it is<br/>\n*different* than if you were totally unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also not saying that what you&#39;re doing is or isn&#39;t unschooling.  I am<br/>\nnot in your home, I don&#39;t know you or your children or see the bigger<br/>\npicture of your relationship and don&#39;t want to define what you do anyway.<br/>\nI&#39;m just adding to your analogy with one of my own--using the most common<br/>\ndefinition of &quot;seat work&quot; that I know....which may or may not resemble what<br/>\nyou do.

My husband&#39;s family is horrified at the idea of our<br/>\nhomeschooling, much less unschooling.  They didn&#39;t like the idea of me<br/>\nnursing past three months, letting the boys sleep with us as babies, and any<br/>\nnumber of other parenting issues.  (This from a family whose 6 year old son<br/>\nis in therapy twice a week.)  We politely listen to them and just let it go<br/>\nas much as we can.  I get upset, but after all these years I am learning to<br/>\nlet it go for my own sanity.  My brother and his wife are vocal to mutual<br/>\nacquaintances (not directly to us) that they think we are doing something<br/>\nterribly wrong.  Friends who wouldn&#39;t dream of counseling us on other issues<br/>\nfeel completely free to tell us that they think homeschooling, particularly<br/>\nunschooling of course, is a dangerous thing.  I&#39;ve been treated to stories of<br/>\nchildren in their teens who cannot count, read or write and will never become<br/>\nproductive members of society.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you and I both know that we want what is best for our kids, and that if<br/>\nthey were truly falling behind, we would do something about it.  We also know<br/>\nthat our children will be happier, healthier and likely more capable after<br/>\ntheir unschooling experience than the children of these people who feel<br/>\nperfectly comfortable criticizing our very personal parenting decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there.  Today I feel like iron.  Tomorrow someone will cut me to the<br/>\nquick.  Either way, I will unschool and see the special light in the eyes of<br/>\nmy boys as they spend 18 consecutive days drawing, catching, watching,<br/>\nreading about, and constructing clay & wooden models of ladybugs for no<br/>\nreason but that it interests them.

Sad, but true. <br/>\nAfter a few solid attempts at trying to explain your choices to your <br/>\nfamily, make a decision as to how you&#39;re going to deal with them and <br/>\nthen move on with or without their support. You will always have <br/>\nother unschooling families on lists such as this that you can turn to <br/>\nfor support.
