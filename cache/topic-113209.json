The State Department of Education does not issue diplomas. Diplomas are issued by either public schools or school districts, or by private or parochial schools, or are earned via GED, or are given by parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost homeschooled kids in NJ who do go through the diploma ceremony do so with their local support group, not a &quot;state-wide homeschool association&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nState homeschool organizations in NJ do not oversee homeschoolers, Therefore, any diploma granted at a graduation ceremony has no more validity than one granted in a family&#39;s living room ceremony, or with no ceremony at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOption b)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany homeschooler create their own individualized learning program for their kids. Most do so because it is best for their child. Many do so because they can&#39;t afford to enroll in an umbrella school.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Since when does a &quot;curriculum developer&quot; determine which homeschoolers have actually benefited from their materials? If they are not grading assignments, how would they know?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOption c) - &quot;third party verification memorandum&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n1) In NJ, the State DOE does not oversee home education. Neither does any public school or school district. Again, this option is nonexistent.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) How would HSLDA know whether any homeschooled student has actually completed high school?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Again, see Option A.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Since NJ homeschoolers do not fall under the authority of public schools, families would have to pay a teacher or &quot;educational consultant&quot; for the dubious privilege of having their grad&#39;s learning assessed and &quot;approved&quot;. Or they could hire &quot;person with a graduate degree in education&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs if teachers&#39; college graduate is suddenly the standard to which homeschooling parents should strain to reach. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: NJ homeschool grads would find the least expensive way to have their education &quot;approved&quot;... would be to join HSLDA!<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, what a way to boost falling membership rates!<br/>\n&lt;/sarcasm&gt; (Sorry, that sarcasm switch is so loose...)<br/>\n<br/>\nRumors have gone around for many years now, saying that HSLDA wants to set itself up as an approval authority, in much the way they set up the Richmans in Pennsylvania.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it nice of the National Guard to assist them?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;/sarcasm&gt;  (Darned switch!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if simply attending a graduation ceremony hosted by a &quot;state-wide homeschool association&quot; is adequate to prove that a kids has an education, then why not simply accept the diploma and transcript straight from the parents?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy McVicker</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.
