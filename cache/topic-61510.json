The one I was using was a now-sought-after, then crappy-scary, big <br/>\nblues guitar.  It had a curved front like a violin, with f-holes.  The <br/>\nstrings were NOT near the neck.  The neck wasn&#39;t flat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to tune it (from having heard my mom tune for years, I knew what the <br/>\nprogression of notes sounded like) and just play it flat on the bed like <br/>\npeople played electric steel guitars (which we also had at the time).  So I <br/>\ngot where the half-steps were and found the scales, just messing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was too big for me to hold right. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was fourteen turning fifteen, that summer, I really wanted to learn.  <br/>\nMy friend Ymelda Martinez was playing, and she said she would teach me.  I <br/>\nwent to her house and she showed me how to use chord charts and I played <br/>\n&quot;Banks of the Ohio,&quot; a fine American murder ballad with three chords (four <br/>\nwhen you get fancy and use a 7th).    I told her I&#39;d come back for another <br/>\nlesson when I had learned that stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never had another lesson.  We still joke about it sometimes, how she taught <br/>\nme guitar.  She says &quot;I DID NOT!&quot;  I say yes, she did, because I needed those <br/>\npointers and advice about how to hold my hand and information about how to <br/>\nread the notation.  Then I just went.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one of the first things I did was to get a better, more modern guitar.  I <br/>\nsold my clarinet and bought an $82 Ventura (Japanese) with a flat neck, more <br/>\nnarrow than a classical guitar, smaller body than that monster blues guitar, <br/>\nand I was totally zooming then.  I still have that guitar.  And a C.F. <br/>\nMartin. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably lots of sites online with chords, and songs with chord <br/>\nchanges marked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61566,"nextTopicId":61584}}
