Can&#39;t really say Pam. I do know there are <br/>\ntimes when he does come to me and say &quot;she&#39;s bothering me&quot; and times when he <br/>\ndoes just &quot;quit&quot; and go in his room. So I guess I need to start keeping <br/>\ntrack of how often each happens. Like I did think of, it seems to be at <br/>\nleast a week since a hitting incident happened. I guess I was looking for an <br/>\nanswer thinking what we did wasn&#39;t working and maybe it is afterall.
