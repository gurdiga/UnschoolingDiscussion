Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future<br/>\n&gt; outcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present<br/>\n&gt; results. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young<br/>\n&gt; kids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based<br/>\n&gt; on it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; possessions or even their own.

They BELIEVED it, not because I told them<br/>\nso,<br/>\n&gt; but they had had some days when they slept later than they had planned to,<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; when they really had to get up and felt too tired.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Waking kids up early for meanness because they stayed up late, &quot;to teach<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; a lesson,&quot; teaches them that other people can be spiteful.  Artificial<br/>\n&gt; lessons are not at all the same as honest learning from the natural world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; End of March, Kirby will have eight days straight of Driver&#39;s ed, 9:00 in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; morning.

And I will not<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; making him go to bed, because I don&#39;t need to.  He&#39;s sixteen and hasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; needed me to tell him when to get up or when to go to bed for a couple of<br/>\n&gt; years.   When he leaves home to go to an apartment or college or whatever,<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t &#39;go crazy.&#39;  His experimenting with staying up all night happened<br/>\nlong<br/>\n&gt; ago.  He has more actual body awareness of his need for sleep than many<br/>\n&gt; adults do, because he has had opportunities to go to sleep when he was<br/>\ntired,<br/>\n&gt; instead of by the clock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He doesn&#39;t have to imagine future outcomes.  He lived them with things<br/>\nwhich<br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t as crucial as getting to work or getting to a test.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;We&#39;ve always had a &quot;clean up after<br/>\n&gt; yourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve modelled taking our dishes to the sink.

I think the Bible Belt <br/>\nis going to resist attachment parenting for a long time because it looks like <br/>\nsin.

Using a pacifier in car trips isn&#39;t a violation of <br/>\n<br/>\ndemand-feeding.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay.  MAKING a child use a pacifier on a schedule would be more in keeping <br/>\nwith the discussion here, though.   Putting a baby in a swing on a schedule, <br/>\ninstead of when he seemed to want to snooze hasn&#39;t been recommended anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I&#39;d much rather see a mother set up a daily time to pick up the <br/>\n<br/>\nhouse and ask her kids to do it with her, than for her to become <br/>\n<br/>\nso discouraged with their lack of participation and caring that <br/>\n<br/>\nshe ditches all the good stuff to be gained from this lifestyle and <br/>\n<br/>\nricochets into the old &quot;control&quot; view.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre those the only two choices?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Here I would agree with you.

Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future <br/>\noutcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present <br/>\nresults. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young <br/>\nkids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based <br/>\non it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s <br/>\npossessions or even their own.

They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present <br/>\nresults. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young <br/>\nkids.) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd unless they&#39;re allowed to try it out, they can&#39;t begin to tie them <br/>\ntogether until they&#39;re much older, until the mother &quot;lets&quot; them try it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids, even under ten, learned that if they needed to get up early they <br/>\nneeded to go to sleep earlier.  They BELIEVED it, not because I told them so, <br/>\nbut they had had some days when they slept later than they had planned to, or <br/>\nwhen they really had to get up and felt too tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nWaking kids up early for meanness because they stayed up late, &quot;to teach them <br/>\na lesson,&quot; teaches them that other people can be spiteful.  Artificial <br/>\nlessons are not at all the same as honest learning from the natural world.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of March, Kirby will have eight days straight of Driver&#39;s ed, 9:00 in the <br/>\nmorning.  I have watched him for years decide how late to stay up on his own. <br/>\n I can tell you now, that when that time comes he will be going to sleep <br/>\nbefore midnight, probably with a couple of exceptions for his D&D games (but <br/>\nthose are Saturdays, and Sundays the class is at 10:00).   And I will not be <br/>\nmaking him go to bed, because I don&#39;t need to.  He&#39;s sixteen and hasn&#39;t <br/>\nneeded me to tell him when to get up or when to go to bed for a couple of <br/>\nyears.   When he leaves home to go to an apartment or college or whatever, he <br/>\nwon&#39;t &#39;go crazy.&#39;  His experimenting with staying up all night happened long <br/>\nago.  He has more actual body awareness of his need for sleep than many <br/>\nadults do, because he has had opportunities to go to sleep when he was tired, <br/>\ninstead of by the clock.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t have to imagine future outcomes.  He lived them with things which <br/>\nweren&#39;t as crucial as getting to work or getting to a test.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;We&#39;ve always had a &quot;clean up after <br/>\nyourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve modelled taking our dishes to the sink.  But we&#39;ve modelled something <br/>\nbetter than &quot;clean up after yourself.&quot;  If my husband or I get up to leave <br/>\nthe table, we will also offer to take someone else&#39;s plate.

Sometimes (many times, <br/>\nactually) I would encounter a mother of multiple kids who took <br/>\nthe LLL approach of attachment parenting to an extreme that <br/>\nwas damaging her family. Nursing all night long and not getting <br/>\nsleep for herself, she felt cranky and tired during the day (the <br/>\nmother). Holding the baby all day, the other kids started to resent <br/>\nthat their mother was always unavailable and attending to the <br/>\nbaby. But no pacifiers, no swings, no baby seats were allowed. <br/>\nNo cribs, no bassinets...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of mother after a couple of babies invariably gave up <br/>\nthis form of parenting by baby four.

Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future<br/>\noutcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present<br/>\nresults. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young<br/>\nkids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based<br/>\non it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s<br/>\npossessions or even their own. (I&#39;m talking about young children<br/>\nespecially--under 10).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this in the first part. What I&#39;m wondering is though, that if <br/>\ngiven enough time, it all evens out and the child is the one that discovers <br/>\nit on his own. The whole possession thing I think is something that comes <br/>\nwith age. You just can&#39;t expect a 2 year old to care for things like an 8 <br/>\nyear old. But it doesn&#39;t last forever if handled in a way so that the child <br/>\nisn&#39;t forced or made to feel &quot;bad&quot;. The sleep thing, I also wondering that <br/>\nif people actually gave the child enough time, if they really would stay up <br/>\nall night. Has anyone had a young child that they allowed to stay up every <br/>\nnight, without comment, still staying up all night long and cranky the next <br/>\nday for more than a couple of weeks??? Around here it doesn&#39;t work that way, <br/>\nthe novelty wore of quick and my kids would crash. And when they are tired <br/>\nand out of sorts the next day, they say so. If I would &quot;let&quot; them stay up <br/>\nfor 2-3 nights and then &quot;make&quot; them go to bed for a few more nights and then <br/>\nlet them stay up and so on, what does that really prove to them and what can <br/>\nthey possibly figure out for themselves. Sometimes inconvenience for parents <br/>\nis worth it in the long run for the children. As far as not eating something <br/>\nbecause of how it looks, so what? I&#39;ve done it too when something just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t look right to me. I would hate for someone to try and convince me <br/>\notherwise on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But I would set some routines to help them. And have. We&#39;ve always had a <br/>\n&quot;clean up after yourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up. I don&#39;t see <br/>\nthat they need to agree emotionally so much as to understand the purpose of <br/>\nit. I see this as helping my kids get a picture of what it means to <br/>\ncontribute to how we run the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly I help them to put things away, I allow them to leave out<br/>\na game over a couple of day period if they are in the middle. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot talking about rigidity. I&#39;m talking about consideration for the<br/>\nfact that seven people are sharing this space together.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;m very anal about housecleaning and neatness. I just try very hard <br/>\nnot to impose it on those around me!!! But with 6 of us here and dogs and <br/>\ncats and friends around, I do need to have a certain look to my house. And I <br/>\ndo mean that &quot;I need&quot;. No one else is that concerned with it around here!! <br/>\nThere are times when I will actuall tell the kids that the look of a certain <br/>\nroom is upsetting me to look at and would they mind helping me neaten it up. <br/>\nOf course this would be all their stuff, I would never ask this of the <br/>\nkitchen or living room!!! I have never had any one of them (aside from the 2 <br/>\nyo) tell me no. They understand that it is important to me and will help. <br/>\nAnd I find that a certain look of their own rooms has become important to <br/>\nthem. Just not to the same degree as me, but then again, it&#39;s not my room.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do say most nights sometime before bed, I think it&#39;s clean up time, can <br/>\nsomeone help me pick up the floor? This is only in the playroom because I <br/>\nneed to vacuum every night to get all the crumbs from the above said 2 yo&#39;s <br/>\nbreakfast, lunch and dinner. Again I always have help. Sometimes I ask <br/>\nbefore their dessert time, sometimes after, it&#39;s just never rigid and not <br/>\nalways an every night thing. Some nights the floor stuff is few and I just <br/>\ndo it or my husband will. It&#39;s not a chore or a mandatory thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;We do have our weekly routines for keeping the house clean and<br/>\nthe kids are continuing those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is that I can&#39;t imagine running a family of<br/>\nseven where everything every day is up for grabs. (And really, I<br/>\nam a very relaxed housekeeper compared to every other mom I<br/>\nknow. I am in no way anal about this stuff.) But  we all get along<br/>\nbetter when there are empty spaces on tables for crafts, books<br/>\nare where they should be, clothes are clean, dinnner happens<br/>\ntogether every night and reading time is around the same time<br/>\ndaily.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with a large family functioning better under those circumstances. I <br/>\njust don&#39;t see it as needing chores or a schedule. My house is not up for <br/>\ngrabs either and it&#39;s pretty much always neat and always clean. Maybe it&#39;s <br/>\njust the way one goes about it. In fact I do believe it is that very thing <br/>\nthat is most important. My kids probably don&#39;t even know what a chore is, <br/>\nyet you would see them do things that I guess others would call chores. <br/>\n(putting away their clothes, both dirty and clean, cleaning up, letting the <br/>\ndogs in or out, etc) So again, I think it&#39;s the approach that is most <br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart &lt;julie@bravewriter.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart &lt;julie@...&gt;&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"On a roll--What is a routine for an unschooler?","postDate":"1043295861","msgId":55841,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwbnFwbCtmNjNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55848,"prevInTime":55840,"nextInTime":55842,"topicId":55841,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It seems to me that one of the ideas talked about here is the need to allow kids choices.

We want them to be internally <br/>\nmotivated. We want them to not feel that there is a world of <br/>\nwonderful attractive stuff out there that we are holding back from <br/>\nthem for their &quot;good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe want to make a safe place for growth, self-directed learning <br/>\nand freedom to create without fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI affirm all of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, one of the things that concerns me is that I  <br/>\nhear women talking about children as though they are <br/>\nlittle adults. Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future <br/>\noutcomes. They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present <br/>\nresults. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young <br/>\nkids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based <br/>\non it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s <br/>\npossessions or even their own. (I&#39;m talking about young children <br/>\nespecially--under 10).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t fault them for this. I wouldn&#39;t demean them, spank them or <br/>\ntreat them condescendingly. But I would set some routines to <br/>\nhelp them. And have. We&#39;ve always had a &quot;clean up after <br/>\nyourself&quot; policy and I haven&#39;t given that up. I don&#39;t see that they <br/>\nneed to agree emotionally so much as to understand the <br/>\npurpose of it. I see this as helping my kids get a picture of what it <br/>\nmeans to contribute to how we run the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly I help them to put things away, I allow them to leave out <br/>\na game over a couple of day period if they are in the middle. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot talking about rigidity. I&#39;m talking about consideration for the <br/>\nfact that seven people are sharing this space together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:<br/>\n<br/>\nSetting a bedtime has helped my kids sleep well and spend the <br/>\nnext day in good spirits. If a child is surprisingly alert one night,<br/>\n I might suggest she page through a book until she sleeps, or I <br/>\nmight rube her back and sing to her. But having her in bed at <br/>\n8:30 or 9:00 is important to her and to me, whether she totally <br/>\ngets why or not. She is willing and that&#39;s because we take great <br/>\ncare in not laying a big burden of expectations on her in all her <br/>\nother waking hours. It&#39;s just the routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read aloud to my younger ones around the same time each <br/>\nday. I encourage my younger kids to sit with me for a chapter. <br/>\nThey can choose after that if they want to stay. They almost <br/>\nalways do. But sometimes at the outset, they haven&#39;t made the <br/>\nmental transition to reading time and if I just left it to them, read <br/>\naloud time might not happen that day because our schedules <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t synch up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I tell them that at this time, I&#39;ll read to them and they are happy <br/>\nto work around it. Do we occasionally skip? Of course. But <br/>\nknowing when something is going to happen that is usually <br/>\npleasurable is actually a relief to several of my kids. They want to <br/>\ncount on something and look forward to it. I think this makes <br/>\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle two are asking for a routine and some accountability <br/>\nfor their goals because they like sharing the process and being <br/>\nable to see themselves achieve their goals. My other three aren&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in that so they run their own gig. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have our weekly routines for keeping the house clean and <br/>\nthe kids are continuing those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is that I can&#39;t imagine running a family of <br/>\nseven where everything every day is up for grabs. (And really, I <br/>\nam a very relaxed housekeeper compared to every other mom I <br/>\nknow. I am in no way anal about this stuff.) But  we all get along <br/>\nbetter when there are empty spaces on tables for crafts, books <br/>\nare where they should be, clothes are clean, dinnner happens <br/>\ntogether every night and reading time is around the same time <br/>\ndaily.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, these are routines that support our unschooling lifestyle. <br/>\nI don&#39;t see them competing with it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am inviting criticism or support. I&#39;m curious to know what others <br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56376,"nextTopicId":56272}}
