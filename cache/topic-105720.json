Add another child or two, and there are just times when one child&#39;s desires have to take a backseat to a sibling&#39;s desires or feelings, with the result being that someone has to be coerced into doing something they didn&#39;t choose.  And that&#39;s not a bad thing.  Learning to defer to others in our families, both as a child and as an adult, is a necessary thing, and it&#39;s one of the benefits of having siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

And if a  person&#39;s life decisions will all <br/>\nhinge  <br/>\non non-coercion, there it  is.<br/>\n <br/>\n...AH, so that&#39;s it.  Sounds like  someone who didn&#39;t interprety/practice NCP <br/>\nthe same way I interpreted  it!  I can see if someone came here spouting that <br/>\nkind of language that  it&#39;d turn you off.  If that had been the way I was <br/>\nintroduced to it, I  wouldn&#39;t have found it attractive or useful ONE BIT, nor <br/>\nwould I have wasted one  minute of my time by investigating it further!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;  Pressing things to meld and blend won&#39;t work  when one group says &quot;no  <br/>\npersonal examples&quot; while the other is saying  &quot;avoid theoretical and <br/>\nhypothetical  <br/>\nquestions and stories.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n...Which is why I still say &quot;forget the  lists...buy the BOOKS&quot; :)    <br/>\n <br/>\nI, and many others, are only saying  that NCP (as well as TCS & NVC) are good <br/>\ntools to use for some radical  unschoolers.  I think they&#39;re especially <br/>\nhelpful to help change deeply  ingrained habits & learn to communicate in helpful, <br/>\nmindful and generally  positive ways.   So if you&#39;re a veteran radical <br/>\nunschooler...yes, I  can certainly understand perfectly that you might not need those <br/>\n tools!  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut I&#39;m a relative newbie of 2  years w/a 6 year old DD.  I was raised by <br/>\nvery authoritarian  parents and tend to be a very controlling person (or used to <br/>\nbe...I&#39;m  working on it).  So, I consider myself to be a radical unschooler  <br/>\nwho uses ideas from all of the above in my Life Toolbox.  And I&#39;m  happy that <br/>\nI&#39;ve found those tools that help me be a better Mom & wife  & friend :)<br/>\n <br/>\nxoxo,<br/>\nDenise <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105649,"nextTopicId":105765}}
