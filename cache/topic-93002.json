Hayden, <br/>\n5, is giddily showing it to his friends and comments, &quot;I&#39;m SO glad I&#39;m an <br/>\nunschooler!&quot; I was beaming but confused, so I asked, &quot;What does one have to <br/>\ndo with the other??&quot; &quot;Look mom! It says *T* and I&#39;m NOT a *T* but I can have <br/>\nthis game anyway!  THAT&#39;S why I&#39;m glad to be an unschooler!!&quot;  (the same boy <br/>\nwho is happy to announce he&#39;s a college student when people ask about his <br/>\n*grade*)<br/>\n<br/>\nHannah, 7, has earned a promotion in Tae Kwon Do.  She brings me the sheet <br/>\nthat explains the testing, etc, and proclaims, &quot;I get to write an essay on <br/>\nRespect!!&quot; (I love to write and I doubt I&#39;ve EVER said it quite this way <br/>\n&lt;bg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~diana, Queen of Everything<br/>\nMother to the Princess of Quite-a-lot and the Prince of Whatever&#39;s Left.<br/>\nLiving proof that today&#39;s mighty oak is yesterday&#39;s nut who stood her <br/>\nground.  ~anonymous<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nIs your PC infected?
