If they have been in school previously or have been tested at <br/>\nall, there is something to give you a jumping off point.  It may not be <br/>\nparticularly accurate and you probably have to satisfy all sorts of regs, but <br/>\nthis could be a time to say X is reading at 2nd grade level according to XX <br/>\nand we will continue to assist him in improving his reading.  Or whatever <br/>\nsubjects the system will still be interested in.  What do they check on?  How <br/>\ndetailed?  Etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, this isn&#39;t ideal unschooling, but it might be a starting point -- using <br/>\ntheir existing documentation to project future educational needs and goals -- <br/>\nmaybe you have to be more exact than one might want to be in a better <br/>\nunschooling world, but you are dealing with regs most of us don&#39;t have to get <br/>\nthrough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to determine what the system wants them to accomplish in the <br/>\nnext X months?  You may be able to do that in less time than school would so <br/>\nyou will have time up front to deschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some sort of pyschological component to the oversight by the system? <br/>\n Is there a psychol in the picture who you could enlist to suggest these kids <br/>\nmay need a certain amount of time off considering all they are going thru?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this oversight end after a while?  Or decrease?  Perhaps true <br/>\nunschooling can&#39;t happen just yet -- not under their watchful eyes -- but <br/>\nwill have to develop over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Beth Burnham","from":"&quot;Beth Burnham&quot; &lt;beth2002@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3-aS2VY9L3EzhQ3IJKIJYfscBLsM-mcL2Wrn_Pic07PEJiJ1OGtibxeYOHR-OqQQ3bqykNvEfzcRz1CtZmm76bQrhOTj6JvhcA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: A Day in the Life....","postDate":"949945659","msgId":6268,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40MDYuNjI2OC45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6266,"nextInTopic":6273,"prevInTime":6267,"nextInTime":6269,"topicId":6053,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Frankly I would much rather give them the room to heal and become a member of the family and not worry about educaitonal goals until they are emotionally and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-401815992\">Frankly I would much rather give them the room to heal and become a<br/>\nmember of the family and not worry about &quot;educaitonal&quot; goals until they are<br/>\nemotionally and psychologically whole and at ease enough to be interested<br/>\nin study of any kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci, I bet if you do this they will naturally demonstrate learning on the<br/>\nscale that those social workers will be looking for are they giving you any<br/>\nguidelines for how long they will allow for the adjustment period before you<br/>\nhave to prove to them that they are learning?

As an example, today was baking day.  Literally.  We have been shopping <br/>\nand mixing and baking all day.  My son has a &quot;belt party&quot; at Tae Kwon Do <br/>\n(when they promote to the next belt) and we are bringing cookies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, my son was standing in the sandbox doing time/distance type word <br/>\nproblems -- If a plane leaves NY travelling 60 miles per hour, etc.  This was <br/>\nhis idea.  Believe me.  I was pre-coffee and had to go get the calculator <br/>\njust to keep up (and it was a good excuse to grab a 2nd cup of coffee).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s us. <br/>\n<br/>\nDaughter is learning to read.  We read a lot.  And do workbooks.  And write a <br/>\nlot.  And draw and paint.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they both take music.  Son is bored; daughter is happy but I am not -- <br/>\nher group class has turned into more of a play time than I want to see -- but <br/>\nwe&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can any of this possibly help you?  I think you have to start with where <br/>\nyou and yours are and plan or not as you are inclined.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is no secret battle plan or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can check on-line or with your school board or with &quot;What Your X Grader <br/>\nShould Know&quot; type books.
