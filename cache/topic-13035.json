I don&#39;t know what conditions would make asthma better or<br/>\nworse except maybe air quality?  Around the Puget Sound area there&#39;s quite a<br/>\nvariety of that. Good days and bad days...good areas and bad.  Sometimes the<br/>\nreadings are off the scale in allergens like trees and grasses and mold. Do<br/>\nany of those things make yours worse? We do have a lot of rain, of course. I<br/>\nknow quite a few people here with asthma and they seem to get by with<br/>\nmedication.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8995,"nextTopicId":12987}}
