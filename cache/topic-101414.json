This <br/>\ncombines two of our &quot;guys&quot; favorite things, and will be great for parties <br/>\n(maybe the &quot;girls&quot; will even join in, cuz we all like LOTR).  Dh and his <br/>\nfriends in high school made giant Risk boards and my oldest ds gave him one <br/>\non plywood a few years ago.  The younger boys , ages 10, 12, and 14 all love <br/>\nit too, and they all stay up for hours playing it.  But this new one has <br/>\nMiddle Earth!!  I think I found one present that is sure to be a hit! :&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey might even want to dress up and play the parts. Last December, two of <br/>\nthe boys were in children&#39;s theater The Hobbit (Thorin and Goblin Captain) <br/>\nso they have some costume parts and props already...<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101413,"nextTopicId":101407}}
