My daughter and her friend will probably be staying at his sister&#39;s apartment in NJ, but that&#39;s small and already has two occupants.  Do visitors ever say in less expensive places outside the city and just travel in by train or whatever?  I feel ridiculously uneducated about this, but don&#39;t have the time to research a lot.  My dh went to Barnes and Noble yesterday and got a lot of information, but I thought asking a real person (you are real people, right? :) ) might be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any input!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan (how&#39;s the weather in NYC?)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5615,"nextTopicId":5583}}
