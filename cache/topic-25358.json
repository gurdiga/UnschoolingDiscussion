The beds are all ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-220273691\">Hi<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kidlets get dirty, so does DH. But they do wash off<br/>\nall the dirt daily, sometimes more if they dirt has<br/>\nyucky or dangerous stuff in it. The beds are all<br/>\nclean. Actually the house is clean. But mostly because<br/>\nI am an esthetics nut and I don&#39;t like the looks of<br/>\ngrubby.  This is unique to me, in my family.  Nobody<br/>\nelse cares, none of my siblings, none of my children,<br/>\nDH, nobody cares about COLOR, FORM, or any of the<br/>\nthings that are essential for me.  They are all Form<br/>\nfollows Function folks. They function a lot, too. So I<br/>\ntry to work around it and proved forms to allow their<br/>\nfunctions that are easy me. They don&#39;t really notice,<br/>\nunless I make a large noise (true confession) when my<br/>\nsewing project is turned into sailboat sails or my<br/>\ndetail paintbrush is used for super glue.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have everything in the &quot;living room/ dining area&quot;.<br/>\nExcept things like large mud projects and too much<br/>\nmotor oil, gasoline, animal goo. Well, the bird has a<br/>\nlot of dander. Most of the electric music stuff went<br/>\nwith the older sons.  I miss it the constant creation<br/>\nof music. But not the bulky clutter and wires. However<br/>\na new collection is forming for DS4. Sigh.  He is<br/>\nstarting with the wires.  Actually I am the guilty<br/>\nparty...I collect the stuff for them.  Little guys<br/>\nreally can&#39;t acquire things of interest to them<br/>\nwithout their grownups.  So there is vast array of<br/>\nitems of interest in a small space. Lots of hobby<br/>\nmotors, batteries, wires, dismantled everything.  Not<br/>\nso bad as I am also an organization nut.  That  part<br/>\nis easy for me (I lived for a while, in my youth,<br/>\ncomfortably out of a backpack.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDs having so much bothers DH though. I think a lot of<br/>\nPapas in our and our parent&#39;s generation (I will be 52<br/>\nin a couple of days) are jealous of their children. Oh<br/>\nwell, the point of being a good parent is to TRY to be<br/>\na good parent.  He is doing better than his Daddy.  I<br/>\nmust say I have been able to learn from my Mother&#39;s<br/>\nmistakes.  She made so many that there have been lots<br/>\nof pitfalls that I&#39;ve been able to avoid.  Thanks<br/>\nMother for identifying these areas for me so I didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to go that way. I got to make a whole batch of<br/>\ndifferent mistakes!! <br/>\n<br/>\nLife ALWAYS provides a teacher when we need one.  It<br/>\njust is uncomfortable sometimes.  All that painful<br/>\ninternal work is what I call a CHORE. Blagh. I don&#39;t<br/>\nalways like it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Not Doing.  I Not Do sometimes because I am not<br/>\nable TO DO sometimes.I have $#$&^%&^%#@ MS. I try not<br/>\nto waste these un-experiences by modifying them into a<br/>\nZen exercise. This is uselfull, actually, in the<br/>\n&quot;letting go&quot; arena.  Of course, my mind cooperates in<br/>\nthat I have CRS, too. And sometimes I just sorry out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my personal belief that most living things have<br/>\nSPIRIT.  This an awareness that is in common with all<br/>\nother living things. As everything is composed of<br/>\neneregy vibrating at different frequencies to maintain<br/>\nits identity....All is One.  We each (trees, rocks,<br/>\npeople) maintain our frequency or viewpoint, but it<br/>\nisn&#39;t really permanent. Other ideas, experiences,<br/>\nfood, etc. modify us and we change or grow. To grow<br/>\nmeans to me that one&#39;s awareness expands with<br/>\ncompassion. &#39;course this is all a bunch or words and<br/>\nwe can get lost in semantics. Which is fun sometimes<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell....if you actually wade through all of this I<br/>\nhope you will remember Pam&#39;s SIL and make allowances. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am basically a hermit, now. I have gone 2 months<br/>\nwithout taking DS anywhere expect the grocery store,<br/>\nlibrary, or post office. However we live in a Field<br/>\nTrip!! That is a book with no end in itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs FL requires a portfolio of &quot;work&quot; examples  showing<br/>\nprogress (to be evaluated annually)and a list of books<br/>\nread, this has highlighted the infinite variety or<br/>\npossibilities in our immediate venue. Documenting this<br/>\nat first was fun, now it is a CHORE. There is SO much.<br/>\nIt is more fun to do it all subjectively. But,<br/>\ndocumenting awareness (ha!) looks good. I use those<br/>\nlittle colored notebook dividers. And Folders, and<br/>\nmore notebooks, ad nauseum.  The globe lives right in<br/>\nthe middle of everything.  DS3 gave it to me as a gift<br/>\nwhen my old one got too outdated. <br/>\n<br/>\nLove and Prayers<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!

These neighbors have<br/>\n&gt; started doing lawn for all houses that can be seen from their home, except<br/>\n&gt; for ours. Why? Because they want everything within the vacinity of their<br/>\nhome<br/>\n&gt; to look a certain way. No children are to be on the lawn, even if they are<br/>\n&gt; getting out of the way of a car. No noise whatsoever after a certain<br/>\namount<br/>\n&gt; of time or before a certain amount of time. No children should be dirty or<br/>\n&gt; barefoot (which mine are constnatly are in the dirt and never have shoes<br/>\non).<br/>\n&gt; They come over here every weekend to talk to Paul about how he can improve<br/>\n&gt; our grass.
