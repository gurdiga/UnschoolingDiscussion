Some of you were kind enough to listen<br/>\nto me rant about the neighbor&#39;s children. I felt like the grabbing was<br/>\nthe kind of new negative behavior she had been evidencing after playing<br/>\nwith the little girl (almost exactly two years older than Jayn). From<br/>\nthis girl Jayn learned to say &quot;You&#39;re not my best friend and I don&#39;t<br/>\nlove you&quot; to another dear friend, completely unprovoked. When I asked<br/>\nJayn if it was true she told me &quot;no&quot;. She also could give no reason for<br/>\nsaying it - I suspect she was trying to find out what would happen. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think what I resent most is that I hate myself for disliking this girl<br/>\nso much. Neither my DH nor I like her at all, although we don&#39;t mind her<br/>\nlittle brother. She is full of irritating behaviors like really<br/>\nbragging/boasting, and is very dominating and manipulative of Jayn (the<br/>\nmain problem!). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShe threatens to leave if Jayn doesn&#39;t &quot;share&quot; - in other words<br/>\nimmediately hand over to her whatever toy (of Jayn&#39;s!) that Jayn may be<br/>\nusing that Renee wants. She has actually gone to the door, paused and<br/>\nthen looked back at Jayn - who ran over to her with the coveted doll<br/>\nshoes and begged her to stay. The next time Renee started that I<br/>\nintervened. I told her she could go or stay as her choice but not to<br/>\nthreaten Jayn with it. When she tells Jayn &quot;You have to share&quot;,<br/>\nsomething she has learned from her home life, I say, &quot;No Jayn chooses to<br/>\nshare her toys with you.&quot; I know she is the way she is because the<br/>\nparents are &quot;ordinary&quot; - time outs, hauling them around by the ear,<br/>\nwithdrawal of privileges, punishments for not &quot;behaving&quot;, I have heard<br/>\nthe mother hit Renee because she was disappointed one day that Jayn was<br/>\nnapping and started to cry and whine. They were at the end of the<br/>\nbalcony and into their house very quickly, and I had no time to say<br/>\nanything, and did not know what to say either. I have heard her tell<br/>\nRenee that she was being sneaky, when she went and got a candy - she was<br/>\nacting surreptitious about it, of course in a home with food<br/>\nrestrictions. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThey evidently believe that you will spoil a child with gifts. Renee had<br/>\nbeen talking at length about getting Mary-Kate and Ashley Barbie dolls<br/>\nfor her birthday (October) with immense anticipation and joy. I am<br/>\nfortunate to live very near to the Mattel factory outlet where all their<br/>\nstuff is pennies on the dollar if you go on close-out Wednesday. The<br/>\nMK&A were there for $6 each (T-R-Us $15-20). Now I know that $6 is a lot<br/>\nto some, but this was after all a special present. So I told the mother<br/>\nabout the store, collected a card for her to have the address, and found<br/>\nout soon that they had gone there. They bought Renee the Ashley doll,<br/>\nbut bought the MK doll for her cousin, keeping it in the house until<br/>\nsaid cousin could visit. Renee must have mentioned it to Jayn every time<br/>\nshe saw her, because Jayn kept on telling me, &quot;The Mary-Kate is for<br/>\nAngel&quot;. Renee has repeatedly said that Jayn has all the toys she, ie<br/>\nRenee, wants. I am convinced that she was only coming here in order to<br/>\nuse Jayn&#39;s toys. She once asked me to tell Jayn to stop &quot;bothering&quot; her<br/>\nwhile she was trying to play with Jayn&#39;s barbies. I told her that Jayn<br/>\nwas acting that way because she wanted them to play together, and that<br/>\nwe were not a toy store for her to come to and not play with Jayn. Renee<br/>\nthen started directing Jayn&#39;s play in a way that irked me, but Jayn<br/>\naccepted for the time being. I am stuck with just not wanting the<br/>\nwretched child near Jayn, and feeling sorry for her too.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI was very stressed about the friendship, which at first I had welcomed,<br/>\nand spent some time looking up related topics on the message boards and<br/>\nin the archives. I felt torn between wanting Jayn to live in the freedom<br/>\nof having her own choices of friends, and feeling that this particular<br/>\nfriendship was affecting her badly. She seemed stressed, and unusually<br/>\nemotional. I was worried because I know that the supervision/early<br/>\nintervention at Renee&#39;s house is lacking. The kids usually seem to be<br/>\nsitting in the kids&#39; bedroom alone, while mother is in the other room. I<br/>\nhad several times come in to find what she called &quot;Renee and Jayn<br/>\nplaying together&quot; was three children engaged in three separate<br/>\nactivities. I notice that Jayn will withdraw into her own play when she<br/>\nis overwhelmed by the bossiness. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI felt like I was somehow letting down the philosophy of freedom if I<br/>\nintervened. The feeling of being ripped apart was destroying my peace of<br/>\nmind, especially since most of the posts I found were suggesting letting<br/>\nthe children make their own errors. Sandra&#39;s posts from the past had<br/>\naccounts of things she has said to other children, and there were<br/>\nexamples of Holly and others who seemed so clear eyed about the toxic<br/>\nbehaviors they encounter in non-unschoolers. But of course they are all<br/>\nso much older than Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to do some soul searching and wondered if I was just having<br/>\ntrouble letting go - but I realized that I have these feelings of dread,<br/>\nand fear, only with this family, and no others. Jayn started being<br/>\nviolent towards other children at the park, refusing to share her sand<br/>\ntoys, which have been free for all for about year hitherto, and<br/>\nscreaming in their faces. I felt like this other child had taken my<br/>\ninnocent darling and sullied her.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally (about 3 weeks of the relationship) I knew I had to take a stand<br/>\n-I decided to limit the access. I noticed that Jayn would pull away and<br/>\nstart engaging in a private activity anything from 45 minutes to an hour<br/>\nafter they started playing. So I went to see Renee&#39;s mother and told her<br/>\nthat I felt the age difference was causing stress to Jayn, she was not<br/>\nhaving enough time to play by herself, and her behaviors were becoming<br/>\naffected. I think it was disappointing to her, as she may have been<br/>\nenjoying the break she was getting when her kids were here for<br/>\nthree/four hours. I tried to focus on it being Jayn&#39;s and my issue,<br/>\nrather than appear to be criticizing Renee. I could hardly go up to her<br/>\nand say, &quot;I hate your rotten kid&quot; even if that were a true<br/>\nrepresentation of my more ambivalent feelings. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHer response was to ask how Jayn&#39;s behavior had changed. I think she was<br/>\ngetting ready to give me some advice, but I didn&#39;t choose to have that<br/>\nconversation. Anyway she said she&#39;d collect Renee in 15 minutes, and I<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Well I was thinking more like one hour instead of 3 or 4&quot;. I<br/>\nthink she may have still been offended because the amount of contact<br/>\ndropped off significantly.    Shucks.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of days later I spoke to Renee&#39;s father, and actually told him<br/>\nhow it stressed Jayn to be dominated all the time. He told me that Renee<br/>\nhad been dominated by the cousin, Angel (2 years older again) and was<br/>\nrepeating behaviors she had learned. Their answer to the problem<br/>\nbehaviors they see was to possibly put her into day care until school<br/>\nstarts - for more kid interaction. I don&#39;t think they did, and she goes<br/>\ninto Kindergarden tomorrow. (They (teachers & parents) decided to &quot;hold<br/>\nher back&quot; to kindergarden rather than 1st grade that her age would<br/>\nallow).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn had been basically kept away from them by a number of strategies<br/>\nwith my dh and I, for about 2 weeks prior to the conference. I saw her<br/>\nsweet nature come back, and she stopped being unusually violent. She<br/>\noften asked to play with Renee and Jonah, but we were always going out,<br/>\nor they were.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we are back home. She spent an hour swimming with them and became a<br/>\nscreamer. She spent 20 minutes in their house, and immediately her<br/>\npersonality changed. She actually kicked Jonah (4yo) and screamed at<br/>\nhim. The mother phoned me to come and get her, but was more upset that<br/>\nshe had &quot;told&quot; (ordered) Jayn to apologize, and Jayn would not, than<br/>\nthat the kicking had happened at all, that Jonah was crying, and there<br/>\nwas no attempt to get to the bottom of it. I came in, knelt down and<br/>\nheld Jayn close while I comforted Jonah and heard what he had to say,<br/>\nthen asked Jayn not to kick him again. I asked her if she would tell me<br/>\nwhy she had kicked Jonah, but she said &quot;no&quot;. I told Jonah I was sorry<br/>\nhis feelings and his belly had been hurt. Meanwhile Renee was standing<br/>\nby, and the mother kept going on about how she had told Jayn to say she<br/>\nwas sorry. I told the mother that we don&#39;t try to force Jayn to<br/>\napologize before she is ready and that she usually does later. Jayn<br/>\nagreed not to kick Jonah again, and we left.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA few minutes at home, and Jayn was ready to tell me why she kicked<br/>\nJonah. He had been knocking down their (the girls&#39;) little town they had<br/>\nmade with Polly Pocket dolls. We spent some time discussing alternative<br/>\nstrategies for Jayn to enact in the future should something similar<br/>\noccur again other than kicking. This shows me that the supervision is<br/>\nstill lacking, Jonah&#39;s need for space in his own room is ignored, Renee<br/>\nwas ready to see Jayn get into trouble and didn&#39;t care to speak up with<br/>\nthe preamble to the kicking even when she heard me ask Jayn why, and I<br/>\ncan&#39;t trust Tania to parent in the way I would like, unlike pretty much<br/>\nall the parents I saw at the Conference. I should add that to my<br/>\nknowledge Jayn has seen one child kicking out in anger in her whole life<br/>\n- guess who - Jonah. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also concerned about the kind of parenting that Jayn is witnessing.<br/>\nShe likes Tania, and wants to be her friend. I wonder what she thinks<br/>\nwhen she sees someone whom she admires using violent repressive<br/>\nparenting - name calling, shaming, punishments, removal of &quot;privileges&quot;,<br/>\nand control. Yet how can I ask Jayn about it without being leading or<br/>\nseeming to be criticizing. I notice that it is always Jayn who is the<br/>\nsupplicant, and that Renee never comes here now. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe end point is that Jayn is only three and a half. Even I sometimes<br/>\nforget how young she is because she is tall and verbal. She has been<br/>\nsheltered from day care, and the vast majority (up &#39;til now) of her<br/>\nother kid interactions are with other homeschoolers (mostly relaxed unit<br/>\nstudy types but wonderful gentle parents). I don&#39;t think that as yet she<br/>\nhas the emotional experience or maturity to stand up to the onslaught of<br/>\na domineering personality. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to be able to trust her to take care of her needs, but right<br/>\nnow I feel like that would be like letting her drink from a bottle of<br/>\npoison. I wish the behavior influence could work the other way, as some<br/>\nof you have witnessed in your dealings with other kids, but I just don&#39;t<br/>\nthink it will right now. I have a horror of being intrusive into other<br/>\npeople&#39;s lives, so I would not give parenting advice to them unasked. I<br/>\nam at the point where I can hardly wait to buy a free standing house and<br/>\nmove.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWell if you got this far, my hat&#39;s off to you. Thank you for listening.<br/>\nMy husband kept saying that I should ask the group for advice, as I<br/>\nfrantically searched the archives and cried every night - this was weeks<br/>\nago before I made my fateful decision to try to control my child&#39;s<br/>\nrelationship with this other. At the time I felt like the worst parent<br/>\nin the world because just being me couldn&#39;t seem to counteract the bad<br/>\nstuff Jayn was getting. I wished I could say the one right thing that<br/>\nwould suddenly turn Renee into the kind of child that I would like to be<br/>\nJayn&#39;s friend. Most shameful of all, I am glad that this child is going<br/>\nto school. She will be away for hours every day, and then they will need<br/>\ntheir family time. I hope she makes a ton of other friends and drops<br/>\nJayn like a hot potato.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe journey continues.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

One of the children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1135094407\">Hello to all, The most wonderful thing I saw at the conference was two small children and their mothers right outside the toddler room.  One of the children had apparently reached out and grabbed the other child&#39;s craft and it had broken.  What a wonderful way the mothers handled it.  I had never, and I mean never seen any interaction like that in my life!  The child that broke the toy was immediatly swept up on her mothers lap, and asked some specific questions as to her feelings,, ( I would like those questions for future reference) the other child was allowed her feelings and the mother was sincerely sympathetic... within minutes the offender was going to get new styrofoam things to help the other child, who had suddenly decided on her own to pick up the pieces and put her craft back together... then it was settled.  No embarrassment, no cut downs, it makes me want to cry for some reason.  I loved it.  This is how I want to interact with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd 10 has taken on some children down the road, for some reason she thinks they should be obedient to her... I asked her why last night and she said because they have to listen to somebody... yeesh, I&#39;m watching her and knowing she is acting like Me?? I don&#39;t want to own it but I do, where else did it come from.  Trying to talk to her about it makes her yell sternly at me, I can&#39;t seem to get her to leave them alone or reason with me,and then the other children tease her and of course seem to do things to make it worse. We are still deschooling from a relaxed homeschool, and trying to remove the authoritarian because I am the parent etc...  I need the right words to speak to her... The children down the street go to school each day then come home and are free to go whereever, do what ever etc.. come to our house for fun, they are 6,5 and 2.  DD is trying to control them, just trying to look for underlying reasons and filter all this out.. why she feels she needs this control. Thanks to the moms at the conference that showed me that it can work.<br/>\n<br/>\nStepheny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79776,"nextTopicId":79803}}
