When I was 9 or 10 I read &quot;When Hitler stole Pink <br/>\nRabbit&quot; by Judith Kerr, which I&#39;ve just discovered (thank you google) is <br/>\nbased on her own life, which is about a family working to run from Nazi <br/>\nGermany and Nazi sympathetic Europe.  I have a copy that I found for 5 <br/>\npence at W.H. Smiths, I wouldn&#39;t mind rereading that.  David rented a <br/>\nmovie from some little artsy video rental in  Albuquerque called The <br/>\nNasty Girl (not a particularly appealing title) which he had seen at <br/>\ncollege or something that is about a girl who in innocently delving into <br/>\nthe history of her town discovers that they were complicit with the <br/>\nNazis.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.harvardfilmarchive.org/calendars/06_spring/verhoeven.html\">http://www.harvardfilmarchive.org/calendars/06_spring/verhoeven.html</a> has <br/>\na bit of information on the film as well as 2 others that might be <br/>\ninteresting.  But not easy watching.  My brother&#39;s first wife set up a <br/>\nproject in New York where she got Holocaust survivors to come to schools <br/>\nand talk about their experiences in the Death Camps and their <br/>\nexperiences in Nazi Germany, maybe you could look at World Federation of <br/>\nJewish Child Survivors of the Holocaust and see if there is a chapter <br/>\nthat you could contact: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wfjcsh.org/chapters.htm.\">http://www.wfjcsh.org/chapters.htm.</a> There is a <br/>\nsection of personal stories there as well: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wfjcsh.org/stories/ontherun.htm\">http://www.wfjcsh.org/stories/ontherun.htm</a> .

I can remember reading a <br/>\nbook about the massacre at Babi Yar and it was horrific and painful, oh <br/>\nand Jerzy Kozinski&#39;s Painted Bird which I absolutely do not recommend.  <br/>\nI read it in my closet, not because I wasn&#39;t allowed, but maybe it felt <br/>\nappropriate, like Ann Frank or because it seemed like secret not to be <br/>\ndiscussed or presented by public reading.  I read about the Donner party <br/>\nin the same way.  I think it might have been nicer for me if I could <br/>\nhave talked about these horrors more publicly.  Instead of lying in bed <br/>\nat night imagining myself drowning under the bodies of others, covered <br/>\nin a dusting of lime, talking about these things with my parents.  I am <br/>\nsure if I had approached them they would have been more than willing to <br/>\ntalk about these things, but I needed them to watch me in order to open <br/>\nthe discussion, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow.

I really appreciated having German <br/>\nfriends during this time for exactly this reason.  They were able to <br/>\nput it into a different light for her that gave a personal human to <br/>\nhuman understanding of it.  I know that some of the things that she <br/>\nsaw and heard about were too much for her to understand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole &quot;why&quot; about it was almost too much for her and in fact I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure I can even understand it.  I can understand in the literal, <br/>\nor logical, but not the emotional or spiritual.  Just like I find it <br/>\nhard to understand why someone can murder someone else even if they <br/>\nhave a reason that I can understand.  When one looks at the <br/>\nholocaust, it is easy to become overwhelmed with the tragedies and <br/>\nhorrors.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason though, Chamille seeks out injustices in the world <br/>\nto find ways to stop them.  So, learning about the holocaust seemed <br/>\njust a part of that aspect of her person.  When we get into stuff <br/>\nlike this, I always try to bring it back out of the details and into <br/>\nthe human nature aspect so that she knows that these are real humans <br/>\nwho are doing the harm and real humans that are doing the hurting.  <br/>\nBeing able to bring it back to that helps her find concrete ways of <br/>\nhelping in her own world where she knows that she can&#39;t change <br/>\neverything but she can make a difference.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, she likes &quot;The Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; for that <br/>\nvery same reason.  The injustices are so obvious, and often so <br/>\nabsurd.  The kids in the book just deal with it by trying to do what <br/>\nis right and saving themselves at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDealing with injustices has helped her narrow down where she wants <br/>\nto put her own energy into helping.  Recently we had a discussion on <br/>\nwhy it would be hard to decide where to donate your time or money if <br/>\nyou had to choose between feeding the hungry or homeless people, or <br/>\nanimals.  Ultimately she chose helping animals.  We talked about <br/>\nplaying to our strengths and to what are hearts call us to do.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s chosen to find a way to volunteer to help animals in need, now <br/>\nwe are looking for ways to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is strange for me to know that I have a child that sees the <br/>\nhorrors and injustices stronger than she sees the joys.  My thinking <br/>\nis that there must be a reason for it.  So I just help her in any <br/>\nway I can.  She really seems to have a better grasp than I did at <br/>\nher age, of the realities of suffering that exist in the world.  <br/>\nThat kind of enlightenment can be a gift and a curse.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Holocaust books suggestions","postDate":"1142439054","msgId":112822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0MTgzQzhFLjkwNzA2MDdAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEIwQTdGNEEzLUJFRjAtNEUwOS04RUQxLTQyMDJBQUNBRUI0RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGR2OTJrOStxYmVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QjBBN0Y0QTMtQkVGMC00RTA5LThFRDEtNDIwMkFBQ0FFQjRFQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":112821,"nextInTopic":112823,"prevInTime":112821,"nextInTime":112823,"topicId":112807,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
