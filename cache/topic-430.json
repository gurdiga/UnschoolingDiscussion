We always take off her shoes and mine there and play in our socks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nClass is over and we are putting shoes back on and I said as usual, &quot;Jackie, left foot, left shoe&quot; and so on and did the same for my shoes.  A mom who was coming in for the next class with the three year olds, (Jackie is only 2), looks at me and says with pure contempt in her voice&quot;OH, You must be one of those MONTESSORI Moms.&quot; and rolls her eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reply was, not necessairly, I just want my kid to know the difference from right from left.  She then says, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t push the kids, they will find all that out in good time.&quot;  The first thought that ran through my mind was,Like when they are going for their first job interview and Mommy has to write it on their hands, is that a good time??  I just smiled and walked away.<br/>\n <br/>\nGrown or manufactored kids????          <br/>\n<br/>\nJust had to share..  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie G.<br/>\n<br/>\nPROUD TO BE A GROWER OF KIDS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96,"nextTopicId":425}}
