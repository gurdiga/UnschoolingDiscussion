The kids are (almost) <br/>\n4 and 1.5, so I know what you mean!   Now that the baby runs all over the <br/>\nplace, usually in the opposite direction as us, I&#39;m not seeing us heading off to <br/>\nthe beach without dad this year.<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t done any swim lessons yet either, but it seems to be all the rage <br/>\nthis time of year for the other 3-4 yr olds in our area.  I asked ds if he&#39;d <br/>\nlike to take lessons and he is NOT interested.  He stays in the kiddie pool and <br/>\nruns around the very shallow wheel-chair access area of the big pool.  At the <br/>\nbeach he&#39;s never gone in further than his knees.<br/>\nI&#39;d like to see him become more comfortable in the water, but we have a short <br/>\noutdoor swim season here and the YMCA is way too expensive, so perhaps as he <br/>\ngets older, we&#39;ll spend more time in the water, and either we&#39;ll teach him or <br/>\nhe can take lessons if he wants to.<br/>\nAs for the kids getting along, 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 are hard ages to get along <br/>\nreally.  They are both quite young.  Mine do well sometimes.  They adore each <br/>\nother but get in each other&#39;s way and fight over toys, typical sibling stuff.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to stay out of it more often now that the baby is getting older <br/>\nand can do more for herself.  Sometimes, they need to work it out on their <br/>\nown.  When someone starts swinging, I do step in.  And it is hard to be patient <br/>\nsometimes, but remember they are just little kids!<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93294,"nextTopicId":93379}}
