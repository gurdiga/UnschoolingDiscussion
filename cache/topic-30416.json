I couldn&#39;t last!  I learned to hate Disney sitcoms and<br/>\nthe behavior she took on during that period of time, mimicing their<br/>\nbehaviors and attitudes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think some people who like the sound of a TV on all day might do<br/>\nbetter with this.  For me, it was agony just having to listen to it all<br/>\nthe time.  After a month or so, I decided to terminate cable.  So we<br/>\ndon&#39;t get any channels at all now.  We have a lot of videos around and<br/>\nwe rent and borrow from the library so there is a lot of time to sit in<br/>\nfront of the TV and it is unlimited.  Only occasionally does she ask<br/>\nabout cable now but I think eventually we&#39;ll go back to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I have to pay for everything she wants.  I think<br/>\neventually she&#39;ll decide to pay for cable and then I&#39;ll have to deal<br/>\nwith it.  Maybe put a TV in her room though I hate the isolation that<br/>\ncreates.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarolyn<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  Since I have completely let go of control, I have learned to relax<br/>\n&gt; about the TV.

Advice was given about the importance of deschooling (yes, even from school-at-home) and how the TV or computer actually sometimes played important roles in this process.
