This</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt; was nothing new to me because I&#39;ve experienced it too; the rod\nwill fall</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt; right off the wall if you pull too hard on the curtain.&nbsp;\nWhile I was putting</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt;

It didn&#39;t take long to pinpoint where the odor\nwas coming from, since I&#39;d</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt; just had my shower.&nbsp; I congratulated Colton on growing up,\nfound him a stick</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt; deodorant in a manly &quot;cool breeze&quot; scent and told him how to\nuse it.&nbsp; Then I</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt; set the deodorant on his bathroom counter, right next to the\nbottle of hair</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt;

think of as &quot;shiny bedhead,&quot; but my son assures me this is &quot;cool.&quot;&nbsp;\nI</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt; wouldn&#39;t know, as I haven&#39;t been cool in 400 years.</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt;</tt>\n<br><tt>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
