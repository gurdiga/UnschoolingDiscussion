You seem<br/>\nlike a very cool beans mature person.<br/>\nI slept with my parents for a long time,too, though I<br/>\ncan&#39;t say an age cuz I got my own bed and room at some<br/>\npoint. I guess I always had them, really, since I was<br/>\nlittle. And there were a few times that they would<br/>\nreally try to make me stay in them,----as a grown-up I<br/>\nthink I now understand WHY they needed a little &quot;alone<br/>\ntime&quot;, though.;) yuck. did I just say that about my<br/>\nparents? ----but even then, they would lay down with<br/>\nme in my bed until I fell asleep and then sneak off.<br/>\n:) -&gt; and all I can say about those times is, well, it<br/>\nfrankly hurt my feelings. And I was scared. Not just<br/>\nof the dark, of everything. monsters, ghosts,<br/>\nburgulars, earthquakes, flies, trees, dying, etc, etc.<br/>\n I thought what if something happens in the middle of<br/>\nthe night, what if a burgular comes in my window? what<br/>\nif I hear a noise or have a bad dream, and I&#39;m not<br/>\nallowed to come in there? How horrifying. They<br/>\nrealized it though and always made sure I knew I could<br/>\ncome in there if I wanted to. My mom is very<br/>\nclaustraphobic though and I liked to entwine myself<br/>\nwith whoever I slept with by throwing my legs over<br/>\nthem, so eventually I just slept on dad&#39;s side. :) But<br/>\nthis continued til I was around 11, I think. Not all<br/>\nthe time every night, but sometimes I would wake up, <br/>\neven when i was 13 or 14 and just instinctively want<br/>\nto go in their room. I got teased, especially when it<br/>\nhappened a couple of times that i would have friends<br/>\nover to spend the night and i would somehow end up at<br/>\nthe foot of my parents bed, I guess I went there half<br/>\nasleep. And i really did want to sleep on my own but<br/>\nit was just so scary to me, so I started choosing to<br/>\njust bring a pillow and blanket and lay on the floor<br/>\nin their room when i woke up, and then it was at thier<br/>\ndoorway, then my room just somehow seemed safer than<br/>\nthe hallway, so it was back in there, eventually i got<br/>\nto where i was satisfied with just going in there,<br/>\nlooking at them and going back to bed. or staying up<br/>\nreading till I passed out, cuz I knew realistically I<br/>\nwas just too big to fit. :) (after the at least<br/>\nwalking in there part, though. I think I would still<br/>\ndo that if it were possible. lol)<br/>\nBut I agree with Ren, it made me feel very secure and<br/>\nsafe to know i was welcome there, no matter what my<br/>\nfriends and my parents friends said. :)<br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n--- Cory and Amy Nelson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amynelson3@...\">amynelson3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Ren-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m so glad you posted and gave us your perspective<br/>\n&gt; as a person who did<br/>\n&gt; cosleep with her parents.

I know of so many<br/>\nboys whose parents worried about lack of motivation but their dedication to<br/>\ntheir children&#39;s autonomy meant that they didn&#39;t try to interfere.  They<br/>\nstill made suggestions, invitations, and were available, but didn&#39;t stop<br/>\nwhat was going on in the children&#39;s heads.  I have seen games turn into so<br/>\nmuch creativity.  Whole civiisations being created, trading cards beign<br/>\ndesigned, enactments of videos,  and I have seen what appeared to be just<br/>\nplain laziness.  My opinion is that it is okay.  Once anybody finds<br/>\nsomething which motivates them, they are on it, they do it. Kids don&#39;t need<br/>\nto practice anything by doing stuff that is boring or that they hate, just<br/>\nso they will be ready later in life to do what they want to do .<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are basically an unschooling family, though, and we don&#39;t have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; regimented routines.

Perhaps you need a<br/>\nmore regimented routine.  DO you get to do enough of the things that are<br/>\nimportant to you.  If you realize your own goals, that is the best lesson<br/>\nthat you children can learn.  If they see you doing something you want to<br/>\ndo, making it happen, then they will learn that when it is thier turn, they<br/>\ncan do the same, and you will be there to help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest takes German and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a computer skills class at a local homeschool family center, but that&#39;s<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; extent of our routine.

The problem is, our 11 yo ds year old wakes up nearly every<br/>\nnight in the middle of the night and wakes me up, and asks me to sleep with<br/>\nhim. If  I don&#39;t, he will get back up 2x, 3x, in a row, and keep asking.<br/>\nUsually I just get up and go instantly, because luckily I can go back to<br/>\nsleep very easily, and also because once my dh is awake, he can&#39;t go back to<br/>\nsleep (and he can be very touchy about this in the middle of the night with<br/>\nwork the next day looming on the horizon, if you get my drift.). My dh asked<br/>\nme the other day if I didn&#39;t think it was weird our 11 year old asked his<br/>\nmom to sleep with him every night. I said I didn&#39;t; I don&#39;t want there to be<br/>\nanything weird about it, and I hope that if I don&#39;t imply there isn&#39;t a<br/>\nproblem with it, then there won&#39;t be. Does that make sense? But I know that<br/>\ndh thinks it&#39;s weird (just fyi, we&#39;re not entirely &quot;functional,&quot; so it&#39;s not<br/>\nalways easy to talk about these things!). I have to admit, I have not been<br/>\nable to talk to a dr. about it since ds was little. He has always gotten me<br/>\nup in the night to sleep with him, so this is not new. I desperately need<br/>\nhelp here. I am hoping this isn&#39;t a &quot;psychological&quot; problem, but I admit<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d keep doing it this long, either. We&#39;ve tried the<br/>\ntalks before bed, no drinking or eating just before bed, going to the<br/>\nbathroom, we&#39;ve discussed what to do instead of waking me up, i.e. reading.<br/>\nOh, incidentally, he is terrible at going to bed, too! He gets up on average<br/>\n5x before falling asleep! We&#39;ve tried later bed times, more activity, oh, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know. Like I said, I really don&#39;t mind; I go back to sleep just fine.<br/>\nWhat I do mind, is the thought of him on a psychiatrist&#39;s chair when he&#39;s 30<br/>\ntalking about sleeping with his mother!
