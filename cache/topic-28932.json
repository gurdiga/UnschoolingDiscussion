After <br/>\nreading Summerhill at the age of 14, the schools never really worked for me <br/>\nagain.  (Never did really.  I just knew why.)  I convinced my mother to <br/>\nhelp me &quot;drop out&quot; at age 16, because I wanted to learn what interested me <br/>\nin the way I wanted to learn it.  I needed her help because it was not easy <br/>\nto drop out in California back then.  You had to go to continuation school <br/>\nuntil you were 18.  My mother went round and round the bureaucrats until <br/>\nfinally the principal said he could let me go on a mental excuse.  So now <br/>\nyou know it.
