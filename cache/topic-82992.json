They did bring up<br/>\nAndrea Yates and maybe others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it was as strongly holding homeschooling responsible for<br/>\nchild abuse as the CBS story. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, I think it had to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve wondered for years when the poo would hit the fan.  The first time I<br/>\nsaw a copy of Home School Digest<br/>\nI wondered how/ why every homeschooler in the world wasn&#39;t being<br/>\ninvestigated, with all that &quot;train up a child&quot; crap and their happy<br/>\nadvertisements for &quot;THE ROD - the ideal tool for child training.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nReligious freedom includes the freedom to hit kids.  Fundamentalist folks<br/>\nare homeschooling to keep their kids away from secular influences.  They<br/>\n*are* homeschooling to isolate their kids and they are &quot;disciplining&quot;<br/>\ntheir kids and they do keep them away from doctors because they&#39;re afraid<br/>\nof the questions.   It&#39;s bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you google Gods Creation Outreach Ministry you can read all about what<br/>\nthe Edgars believed.  You can read some stories about how church members<br/>\nhog tied kids and left them in bathtubs and closets as discipline and how<br/>\nthe boy who died was once tied &quot;crucifixion style&quot; to a bunk bed.  Nine<br/>\nyear old Brian Edgar had a sock stuffed in his mouth, duct tape wrapped<br/>\naround him and a belt round his arms and chest and was left to die in his<br/>\nbed that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCBS linked child abuse to homeschooling because they didn&#39;t have the<br/>\nballs to link it to fundamentalist freaks. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] NEWS:  Home School Defender: CBS Used Tragedy to Push Regulation","postDate":"1066283160","msgId":82994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1NzRBODhCLUZGOUMtMTFENy05NzFFLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwLjM2NzMwMjRlLjJjYmY3ZDhiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":82993,"nextInTopic":83006,"prevInTime":82993,"nextInTime":82995,"topicId":82992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The parents of the<br/>\ntwo children had reportedly been home schooling them, and<br/>\nwere under investigation by the Department of Social Services<br/>\nfor abuse and neglect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense<br/>\nAssociation (hslda.org) (HSLDA), believes CBS used the<br/>\ntragic case to push for government regulation of home<br/>\nschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What does home schooling have to do with this? Nothing,&quot;<br/>\nSmith says, adding, &quot;The only thing that [the media] can<br/>\npoint to is that these folks were alleged home schoolers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSmith says he does not think the parents in the CBS news<br/>\nstory ever even attempted to comply with state home-<br/>\nschooling association guidelines, something his group is<br/>\nattempting to verify. In any event, he feels CBS News is<br/>\ntaking an isolated incident out of its true context to bolster<br/>\nits case against home schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re trying to figure out why they&#39;ve taken this situation to<br/>\ntry to support their position, because it doesn&#39;t do it,&quot; Smith<br/>\nsays. He believes that instead of operating on a factual basis<br/>\nand reporting the news fairly, CBS was using emotionalism<br/>\nin the hope of sparking public outrage against the home<br/>\nschooling movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmith feels the CBS reports are deflecting attention and<br/>\nconcern from where they should be focused. &quot;I&#39;m trying<br/>\nto figure out why this turns against home schooling rather<br/>\nthan against the Department of Social Services,&quot; he says,<br/>\n&quot;because they&#39;re responsible for protecting children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSmith points out that the system in place requires Social<br/>\nServices to investigate abuse and neglect, which that<br/>\ndepartment claims to have done. &quot;It appears to me that the<br/>\nconclusion CBS is making of these facts is totally illogical,&quot;<br/>\nhe says.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HSLDA was established to defend and advance the<br/>\nconstitutional right of parents to direct the education of their<br/>\nchildren and to protect family freedoms. The legal defense<br/>\ngroup has been involved in a number of home schooling<br/>\ndisputes in North Carolina, including the recently resolved<br/>\nStumbo case, in which the state&#39;s Supreme Court finally<br/>\nruled against the Department of Child Protective Services<br/>\nand in favor of safeguarding the privacy of home-schooling<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Smith, the Stumbo case was significant<br/>\nbecause North Carolina&#39;s high court found that social<br/>\nworkers are obligated to examine reports alleging abuse<br/>\nor neglect to make sure they rise to the level as defined<br/>\nby the law before initiating an investigation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HSLDA president feels that every anonymous report<br/>\nof abuse should not necessarily result in an investigation,<br/>\nbut that social workers need to carefully scrutinize each<br/>\nreport so that they will not subject families to unjustifiable<br/>\ntrauma due to a trivial or false allegation. While the incidents<br/>\nreported in the recent CBS Evening News story were tragic<br/>\nand may have been a situation of actual abuse, Smith<br/>\ncontends that the story has little or nothing to do with home<br/>\nschooling. He believes the media simply used that spurious<br/>\nconnection for their own purposes, and is urging families to<br/>\nphone or e-mail CBS to complain about its &quot;Eye on America&quot;<br/>\nreport.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~ ~~~ ~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82723,"nextTopicId":83010}}
