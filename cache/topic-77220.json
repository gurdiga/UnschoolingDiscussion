I finally went out and bought one of those green people with the <br/>\norange flag that says &quot;Slow Children.&quot; I even stood at the end of my dw letting <br/>\npeople know I was there and some I even pointed at and said please slow down. <br/>\nThey prob. only herd me say PL..... or maybe some please but they knew what I <br/>\nwas doing. The ones with children have slowed down.<br/>\n<br/>\n One teen across the street actually sped up but a week later she bounced <br/>\nherself off a couple guardrails on the highway. She is fine and has a new car she <br/>\nwas on the cell phone..huh? Its a law too.<br/>\nI also when coming down our road I make a point not to go over 35 esp if I <br/>\nhave a speeder behind me. They can learn from my example...I hope. Laura D<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We live on a very busy street (especially in the summer with all of <br/>\nthe tourists) in Gloucester MA. I think about that street all the time. We have <br/>\na great big back yard but the only way to get to our cars is to go outside the <br/>\nfront way, right next to all of those cars racing down the road. Now, when I <br/>\nsay I think about this often, I mean it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77131,"nextTopicId":76896}}
