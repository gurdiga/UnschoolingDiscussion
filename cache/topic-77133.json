I have an alchoholic father.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever liked to drink in excess.  Only been &quot;drunk&quot;  2 or 3 times in my life, <br/>\nthose times were before I was 25.    I may have a cocktail occasionally, but <br/>\nonly one, because alchohol makes my face hot.   I hate the taste of beer, never <br/>\ndrank a whole one.   One of my sisters was kind of wild in college, but never <br/>\nbecame an alcoholic.  My other sister&#39;s involvement with alcohol is just like <br/>\nmine - minimal.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI must say though, I DO have an addictive personality.   I over eat.   I get <br/>\nfixated on projects or hobbies and let everything else go.    I have had other <br/>\naddictions that I really do not want to go into detail about.   Actually, <br/>\naddictive behavior to &quot;things&quot; that are not physiologically addictive... hmmm, it <br/>\nis sort of a contradiction of the term &quot;addictive&quot;.    But, I do know, even <br/>\nif the addiction is purely psychological, it IS real.   It causes physical <br/>\nsymptoms and seems and can be painful on many levels for everyone involved.    I <br/>\nthink my dad is more physologically addicted to alcohol than physically.  I <br/>\nthink I inherited the &quot;addictive personality&quot; from my father.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77129,"nextTopicId":77135}}
