Theres also a<br/>\npublication for teenage girls called New Moon  dont know how to track that<br/>\ndown. Grace Llewellyns books, The Teenage Liberation Handbook and Real<br/>\nLives, might be of use, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anybodys interested in writing, as opposed to reading, I recommend<br/>\nNatalie Goldbergs Writing Down the Bones. Ive heard of a book called<br/>\nQuestions for My Father, written by a man who compiled the questions he<br/>\nwished hed asked his father before he died.
