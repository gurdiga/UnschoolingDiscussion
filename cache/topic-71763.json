(I play with my 8 year <br/>\nold son).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can create a dack out of any cards that you have. So if you <br/>\nwant the Kaiba cards with your starter deck, no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing the rules book tells you, though, is how to create <br/>\na deck to use for the game. It recommends that you only use <br/>\nabout 40 cards. That means some deck assembly beforehand. If <br/>\nyou&#39;re just starting out, use their guidelines. The main thing to <br/>\nkeep in mind is that you have a good number of monster cards <br/>\nwith less than five stars. If you load your deck with monster <br/>\ncards that are have five or more stars, you have to offer a tribue <br/>\n(sacrifice a lower star monster card) in order to play the more <br/>\npowerful monster cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first played, my son overloaded both our decks with the <br/>\nreally powerful monsters and almost immediately we got stuck <br/>\nand unable to do much of anything. We couldn&#39;t get monsters on <br/>\nthe field and then couldn&#39;t use our magic or trap cards either. <br/>\nThe game went nowhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo bottom line: use any yu-gi-oh cards you have in any <br/>\ncombination that you have from any deck that you have, but be <br/>\nsure to follow the rule book guidelines at the beginning for the <br/>\nright ratio of types of cards to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmazingly, I&#39;ve come to enjoy playing!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Yu-Gi-Oh help needed!","postDate":"1054512131","msgId":71763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJiZTQ2MysxMDduakBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71768,"prevInTime":71762,"nextInTime":71764,"topicId":71763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are playing Yu-Gi-Oh for the first time and trying to make our way through the rule book.
