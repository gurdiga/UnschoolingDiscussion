To act, instead of be, better.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter someone said &quot;good post&quot; or something to what contained this, I see the <br/>\nneed to pull it and elaborate.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first priority is being.  I want my children to BE honest and generous, <br/>\nnot just act honst and generous.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other choices, though.  It&#39;s not just that anyone who isn&#39;t <br/>\ngenerous is always stingy.  It&#39;s not that anyone who doesn&#39;t always see the value in <br/>\nhonesty cheats and lies all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as a secondary wish, if someone isn&#39;t really nice, it&#39;s better that they <br/>\nact nice than not.   If someone isn&#39;t really very sociable, they should fake it <br/>\nfor the length of a party or project.  If someone doesn&#39;t believe in <br/>\netiquette and manners, they might at least fake it during dinner at the table with <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Fake it til you make it&quot; is better than &quot;never even fake it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut &quot;honestly understand and live it&quot; is even better than &quot;fake it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86761,"nextTopicId":86830}}
