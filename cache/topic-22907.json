Such<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; outline is for informational purposes only.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Unlike public schools and some home schooling families, we do not decide<br/>\n  &gt; in<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; advance what we will cover over the course of the year.  We have made<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; assurances in section #5 that the required areas will be covered and in<br/>\n  #8<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; that a minimum of 900 hours of home education will occur.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; We intentionally strive to allow our curriculum to be interest-driven;<br/>\n  &gt; that<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; is, based on the interests of each child.  With our guidance our<br/>\n  children<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; decide what, when and how they will learn.  We want them to be active<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; participants in their education, not passive receivers.  It is our<br/>\n  belief<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; that through this process their self-esteem will be preserved and they<br/>\n  &gt; will<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; be empowered to make good choices throughout their lives.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; We have access to and knowledge of typical public school curricula and<br/>\n  &gt; take<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; those into consideration as we offer opportunities to our children<br/>\n  (which<br/>\n  &gt; we<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; do in abundance). We believe that the most developmentally interests and<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; needs.  Because our children do not naturally divide the world into<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; curriculum areas (language arts, math, etc) our curriculum is inherently<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; integrated.  The children may pursue interests for varying lengths of<br/>\n  time<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; (hours to months) and one interest often leads naturally to another.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; When it is time for our children&#39;s portfolios to be reviewed by a<br/>\n  &gt; certified<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; teacher, we collect our many journals, photograph, scrapbooks, and<br/>\n  &gt; projects,<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; to show all of the interesting things they have discovered and the<br/>\n  skills<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; they have acquired in the process.  This is our course of study; it is<br/>\n  an<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; after-the-fact curicullum.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; 7) List of textbooks, correspondence courses, commercial curricula, or<br/>\n  &gt; other<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; basic teaching materials that the parent intends to use, and who will<br/>\n  have<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; the primary responsibility for instruction.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Our list may include some or all of the below listed materials:<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Library books<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; books we own (100&#39;s of them!)<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; woodworking<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; gardening<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; theater<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; videos<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; CD ROM&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; educational television<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; music tapes/cd&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; local businesses<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; textbooks that meet what we want to learn<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; discussions with those who are involved directly in what he wants to<br/>\n  learn<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; the computer<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; the internet<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; encyclopedias<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; our weekly homeschooling support group<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; newspapers<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; magazines<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  art materials found in our home<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  art classes offered by an outside source<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  music lessons<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  playing team sports<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  Scouting<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  vacations<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  Religious activities<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  games<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  puzzles<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  manipulatives<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  museums<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  local parks<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  volunteer activities<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  aquariums<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  zoos<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  community involvement opportunities<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  dictionaries<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  County Metro Park activities<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  state/national parks<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;  nature hikes<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; 8) Each child must receive at least 900 hours of instruction per year<br/>\n  (the<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; equivalent of 180 school days) from a person with a high school diploma<br/>\n  or<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; the demonstrated equivalent.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Jimmie will receive at least 900 hours of instruction from myself or his<br/>\n  &gt; father,<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; both of whom have at least high school diplomas.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; 9) Home instruction may be provided by a person who does not have a high<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; school diploma if he or she is working under the direction of a person<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; holding a baccalaureate degree from a recognized college until the<br/>\n  child&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; or<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; children&#39;s test results demonstrate reasonable proficiency or until the<br/>\n  &gt; home<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; teacher obtains a high school diploma or the certificate of high school<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; equivalence.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; This is not applicable.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; 10) The parent(s) shall affirm the information supplied with his or her<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; signature prior to providing it to the superintendent.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
