Seems like that balance is what Sheila is <br/>\nseeking and I have to say that it is hard to nail down because the <br/>\nequilibrium point shifts constantly as the kids grow and change and <br/>\nlife circumstances change and WE grow and so on. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the point at which people will recommend to a mom that she pursue <br/>\nsome of her own interests is when she seems totally co-dependent on her <br/>\nchildren for her own emotional satisfaction, or intellectual satisfaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always liked music, and I remember going through a few years when the <br/>\nonly music I &quot;studied,&quot; researched and learned was Raffi (I would tell the <br/>\nkids which songs were traditional and which were his originals), or Sesame Street <br/>\n(I often knew who had written it), or Animaniacs (they had some really great <br/>\nstuff).  Weird Al was the closest I was coming sometimes to adult music. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\nBut that&#39;s not a bad thing.  Holly and I have looked for lyrics and composer <br/>\nfor a names song that Bob and Olivia sang on Sesame Street long ago.  It has <br/>\ntwo lines that the go together.  The first lines are &quot;I like my name, it fits me <br/>\nto a T, I like my name, it even sounds like me...&quot;  (Just in case any of you <br/>\nhappen to have a lead we don&#39;t have.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one of my interests easily overlapped with what was going on in their <br/>\nlives already, and I wasn&#39;t feeling crowded.   It&#39;s efficient and good in many <br/>\nways when unschooling parents can get truly interested in kid-stuff when their <br/>\nkids are little.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when and if a mom is complaining that she feels she has no life, people <br/>\nrecommend that she find something that seems lifelike to her.  If she complains <br/>\nthat she&#39;s tired of kids&#39; music, people recommend she listen to some other <br/>\nkinds of music on her own.  It&#39;s not always so much a recommendation for the <br/>\nmom&#39;s sake (though in part it is) as it is &quot;find something that will soothe you <br/>\nso that you don&#39;t torment and resent the kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as the kids get older, it&#39;s helpful for them to see parents pursuing <br/>\ninterests not just because the kids might be interested in doing the same things, <br/>\nbut because they see how to balance a life with a hobby in it.    My husband&#39;s <br/>\nbeen doing woodwork for a few years now, and he mostly uses it as a relaxing <br/>\ntime and an artistic outlet.   The kids will go out and watch him and talk to <br/>\nhim sometimes.  They&#39;re learning a little about what kinds of woods carve more <br/>\neasily and about how much scrap there might be from a project, and what the <br/>\nsafety considerations of hand carving are, and how patterns can be transferred, <br/>\nbut not because anyone&#39;s telling them, just because they&#39;re there.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody else (not even me, even though I messed a little with woodcarving <br/>\nyears ago) has said &quot;Can I try it?&quot;  They might someday, and they might never.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it would be good for a parent to have a hobby that totally <br/>\nexcluded a child, something so dangerous or removed that the child couldn&#39;t even <br/>\nsee them do it.   Really fragile hobbies like pouring, firing and painting <br/>\nlittle ceramic things, might be cruel to do in front of kids you don&#39;t want to <br/>\nhave touching anything.   I quit sewing for a few years when the kids were little <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t have room to leave my things out and I didn&#39;t want a toddler <br/>\nto get pins and needles in him or on the floor while I was changing the baby.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Continuum concept and unschooling","postDate":"1077548395","msgId":91327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMxZDRoYitlMTU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMxYWxrNSt0aDd1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91326,"nextInTopic":91328,"prevInTime":91326,"nextInTime":91328,"topicId":91272,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In the primitive culture in which the author discovered the continuum concept, the adults time is taken up with working.

The Child-Free people. I respect people who don&#39;t want to have children. They know what&#39;s best for them. However, when I&#39;ve heard some of the people associated with this movement speak or be interviewed they carry on a) as if parents are mindless minions of domineering children, b) the burden children can be to someone&#39;s life and c) how just plain awful it is that parents get all those special privledges at work. <br/>\n    Toughening laws against youth offenders and shutting them away instead of caring about them. Just get them out of our sight.<br/>\n    The demonization of teenagers. Again, out of our sight, they steal stuff anyway.<br/>\n    Mothers on TV. OK, some are okay but that one on CSI, the redhead? Her daughter was there to drive one plot and then gone again. Keep her out of our sight. (Sidenote - Has there ever been a  female corpse on either CSI that wasn&#39;t slim, young and dressed scantily?)<br/>\n  School. Of course. <br/>\n    The move to keep teenagers out of adulthood. No sex, no drugs untill you&#39;re out of school. And NO getting out of school or you&#39;re a bum. We don&#39;t want to see them on the streets anyway...they steal stuff.<br/>\n    Actually I think I&#39;m making more of a case for how we treat teenagers. Which is horribly.

It seems like the net result is very <br/>\nsimilar in practice (to the degree that it is even possible to be <br/>\n100% CC in the idustrialized world) but the reasoning that gets you <br/>\nthere is a shade different. I think in both cases you have natural <br/>\nlearning, and a shift away from schoolish paradigms, and you also <br/>\nhave children that are not inhibited in their endeavors or <br/>\novermanaged, but the difference is more pronounced in the mind of <br/>\nthe parent. As an unschooler I would probably see myself more as a <br/>\nfacilitator for the child, where as a cc&#39;er I would see myself more <br/>\nas a model for the child. Not that a cc child has any obligation to <br/>\nemulate the model, or that either role is mutually exclusive, but I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s the idea that in unschooling, the parent would find <br/>\nthemselves drawn into the child&#39;s world (playing yu-gi-oh for <br/>\nexample) and in cc the parent would just do adult work (make it <br/>\naccessible) and let the child join in the adult world (or not) at <br/>\ntheir own inclination. The parent works alongside the child, but the <br/>\nparent doesn&#39;t really play per se, or follow the child&#39;s passions - <br/>\nthat is up to the child. I think both philosophies can inform each <br/>\nother because they both work on the principle of giving your <br/>\nchildren autonomy, but they do not seem interchangeable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@p...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts on whether the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>continuum <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; concept philosophy and the radical unschooling philosophy are <br/>\n&gt; completely compatable.
