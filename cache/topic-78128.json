Crispin doesn&#39;t go for the usual stuff like outlets etc. <br/>\nand we don&#39;t use toxic cleaners or anything.  Crispin likes pull <br/>\neverything down.  The covers, the curtains, shower curtains, empty the <br/>\ndiaper pail, or better yet fill it with the mail or my teaching stuff.  <br/>\nI want to move my office from the living room to the basement, and move <br/>\nour bedrooms downstairs and make the bungalow bedroom area all play all <br/>\nkids all the time.  I just need to make my husband disappear for a day <br/>\nor two so he can&#39;t grumble through the process and a pair of non cat <br/>\nallergic hands to help with the big stuff.  And someone to run the <br/>\ncables etc for the computers for his and my offices.  The only thing is <br/>\nthat when we move Crispin out of our bed, there wouldn&#39;t be room for <br/>\nhis bed in our room, he&#39;d have to be in Harriet&#39;s room.  They do sleep <br/>\ntogether in her bed occasionally, but now that&#39;s all in one room.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ll see...I think it&#39;s worth the work.<br/>\nOn Thursday, August 7, 2003, at 04:43 PM, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; CHILDPROOFING!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you don&#39;t have a childproof house, you&#39;ve made your life way more<br/>\n&gt; difficult than it needs to be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;but my husband wants to move so badly he won&#39;t agree to totally<br/>\n&gt; rearrange the house with me ;)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do it without him.
