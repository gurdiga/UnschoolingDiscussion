I use a talisman, too (&quot;Well, I <br/>\nhave several degrees...&quot;) and that always seems to garner some <br/>\nrespect for our lifestyle.  But I always feel icky after I say it, <br/>\nlike I had to justify myself to a total stranger or that I copped <br/>\nout.  I&#39;m trying to give myself a break though.  But I think for me, <br/>\nit&#39;s part of the process I&#39;m going through being new to <br/>\nhomeschooling, and unschooling in particular.  I&#39;m still trying to <br/>\ndivorce myself of the schoolish ways (emphasis on myself, not my <br/>\nkids, they are leaps and bounds ahead of me).  Everything about <br/>\nhaving been brought up in a school minded mentality/society sets us <br/>\nup to justify ourselves, either with grades, class rank, <br/>\nqualifications, etc. and I have 37 years worth of that to undo!!  So <br/>\nthat&#39;s part of it for me, and it&#39;s also part of my process to work <br/>\non making myself a stronger person for my family, my children, to <br/>\nlive the unschooling life within our own family unit before I try to <br/>\neducate the rest of the world.  I&#39;m still figuring it all out and <br/>\nhow to live it.  Unschooling isn&#39;t a &quot;cause&quot; for me, it&#39;s just a <br/>\nnatural way of living, so I try not to get too worked up about <br/>\ncomments from strangers and realize that those same comments are <br/>\nwhat drew me away by intimidation from living this kind of life in <br/>\nthe first place.  Sometimes I think the most important way to be an <br/>\nactivist is to live the lifestyle like it wasn&#39;t a cause, just your <br/>\nnatural state of being.  I feel more confident that way.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nneed to explain &quot;myself&quot; to anyone, so when I think of unschooling I <br/>\nthink of it being a part of myself instead of something seperate.  <br/>\nStill, I hate to waste a lot of energy or a good days positive <br/>\noutlook arguing, so I&#39;ll use the talisman to easily opt out of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a comment made by Alicia Silverstone (the &quot;Clueless&quot; <br/>\nactress/PETA/Vegan activist) in Jane magazine (aren&#39;t I the bookish <br/>\none) that kind of came close to how I feel.  She said that she used <br/>\nto be a lot more vocal about her causes with anyone that took <br/>\nexception to them, but now she has  come to the point where she <br/>\nknows in what forum her activism will make a difference.  It&#39;s sort <br/>\nof a waste of energy otherwise.  I try to remember that when I feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m copping out on explaining our reasons to <br/>\nhomeschool/unschool.  I think a lot of folks are closet verbal <br/>\nabusers, and use opinions as a way of achieving their &quot;release&quot; and <br/>\nI&#39;m just the current victim. Have you ever met someone that lives by <br/>\nthe mantra, &quot;I&#39;m entitled to my opinion&quot; and then uses that mantra <br/>\nto justify saying nasty, *unsolicited* things to people?  Those are <br/>\nthe folks I&#39;m talking about, generally speaking.  So I either use my <br/>\ntalisman with them or just make it clear through my body language. <br/>\netc. that I don&#39;t have any interest in discussing the subject at <br/>\nlength.  I&#39;m not good at saying &quot;none of your business&quot;.  I&#39;m a lot <br/>\nbetter at acting as if I&#39;m not interested in a person, that often <br/>\nhas the same effect..<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I get the urge to share an opinion, I always ask myself, is it <br/>\nkind, it is necessary and is it asked for, before I go about sharing <br/>\nit.  I kind of turn that around a little to help me decide if I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to defend my lifestyle/opinions, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nCindi<br/>\n(who&#39;s been lurking a while)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153142310,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;tri_mom@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Personal questions Was Adoption","postDate":"1085462857","msgId":94659,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM4dWxnOSs5b2ViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZBRTI4RTFDLUFEQzYtMTFEOC04MkY2LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94635,"nextInTopic":94723,"prevInTime":94658,"nextInTime":94660,"topicId":94514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... they ...

The next question <br/>\nwas how old was he, then was he in school. He proudly said, &quot;No, we <br/>\nhomeschool!&quot; To which she looked at me for confirmation. (Why, I&#39;m not sure-he had <br/>\nspoken for himself up to that point, with no &quot;corrections&quot; or interrruptions from <br/>\nme.) Then she asked if he had any friends his age that he played with, and <br/>\nsince he is pretty literal and factual, and at the time he was 4 1/2 and had no <br/>\nEXACTLY 4 1/2 year olds that he played with (5, yes, 4, yes, etc. but no one 4 <br/>\n1/2!

You&#39;re always around adults.&quot; <br/>\nUgh. I hastened to remind Wyl about the kids he plays with on a regular basis, <br/>\nand then he understood that she meant somone AROUND his age, and hopefully, <br/>\nshe got the point. Or maybe she thought I was making it up. Who knows. At any <br/>\nrate, his friendliness got him a tour of the walk-in cooler and a brief <br/>\nexplaination of how that area works in the grocery store, as well as an invitation to <br/>\ncome find her the next time we&#39;re in the store.

I grew up w 3 red headed brothers and now have a red headed son. My<br/>\nbrothers all have brunettes or blondes.   I suppose people are just wanting<br/>\nto say something but it IS an odd thing to say.  No one asks where someone<br/>\ngot their brown hair from.  Once when my brother was about 3 someone asked<br/>\nhim if there were any redheads at home and he replied, yes, 2 headed<br/>\nbrothers, a redheaded dog and some redhead fish.  Why not say, what great<br/>\nhair.  I wonder if there&#39;s some history involved w/ the question.  Like in<br/>\nthe Middle ages, red hair was seen to be the work of the devil or something.<br/>\nSorry this is my my middle ( for me ) of the night musings.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wonder about. Some times if I mention we&#39;re homeschooling<br/>\nto strangers, they will gather themselves up several inches taller and tell<br/>\nme why this is such a bad idea and they believe this and that.  I think, had<br/>\nI said I was sending them to Catholic school or a Jewish Orthodox school<br/>\nwhich they might have thoughts about, they would never share those thoughts<br/>\nthinking that&#39;s my personal preference. But someone this seems fair game.<br/>\nDo others have that experience?  And I wonder why that is.  Maybe bc they<br/>\nthink that it really is a much better idea than they&#39;ve got going and have<br/>\nto defend against it.  I find it a strange phenomenon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94728,"nextTopicId":94729}}
