If my young child asked me if they <br/>\ncould smoke...   I&#39;m thinking about some real life situations I have been <br/>\nin.... OK. . my father in law smoked.  My kids would  ask us why Grandpa <br/>\nsmoked.  We would say that when Granpa was younger, a lot more folks smoked.. <br/>\npeople didnt really know how harmful it was.  Lots of people smoked, that <br/>\nthought it was &quot;cool&quot;,  and they didnt realize they could get very sick from <br/>\nit.  Grandpa started smoking, and now, he is addicted to nicotine and he <br/>\ndoesnt want to try hard enough to quit smoking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReally, in a way, maybe being around a smoker occasionally made it easier for <br/>\nthem to see how nasty it is. My dad smoked until he had a heart attack at 38. <br/>\n I never wanted to smoke because I detested his smoking.  Smoking was never <br/>\n&#39;attractive&quot; to me because it stunk, and smoking played a big part in my dads <br/>\nheart attack.  My kids know all of that about thier Grandpa.   I also have an <br/>\naunt that I am as close to as a sister who smokes ALOT.  My kids do not like <br/>\nto go to her house.. IT STINKS!  They dont like to ride in the car with her.  <br/>\n It bugs them that she smokes and smells like smoke.   We always sit in the <br/>\nno smoking area at restaurants, and if there is a smoker nearby that stinks <br/>\nup our meal, we ask to move.  My kids are as adamant about moving as my dh <br/>\nand I are.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my very first question to a kid who asked to smoke would be &quot;why do <br/>\nyou want to try it?&quot;   I would look at the specific situation.. What made <br/>\nsmoking seem attractive?  Does someone they look up to smoke?  Did they see <br/>\nit on TV and it looked cool?   Maybe they just saw someone smoking in passing <br/>\nand they are curious...   Find out WHY..     Of course, each different &quot;why&quot; <br/>\nmay merit different responses.  <br/>\n<br/>\n If a child is just downright curious,  about the &#39;act&quot; of smoking, I would <br/>\nlet them try one.   I doubt any young child would find it enjoyable, quite <br/>\nthe contrary, they would probably think.. GADS, .. thats nasty!.. If you dont <br/>\nwant to go that far, maybe take them to a place with heavy smoking where they <br/>\ncan get a good lungful of second hand smoke.   If they want to emulate <br/>\nsomeone they look up to.. Talk to that person privately, tell them your child <br/>\nwants to try smoking.. Most folks would be glad to sit down with a child and <br/>\nexplain to them that thier smoking is NOT something they they are proud of.  <br/>\nThink of all the other things that make the child look up to the person.     <br/>\nMaybe that person will stop smoking around your child.. maybe they will stop <br/>\naltogether..  <br/>\n<br/>\n All of these solutions of course should be accompanied by lots of talking <br/>\nand information about the dangers of smoking, the reasons some people chose <br/>\nto smoke, the effects of second hand smoke.. etc etc..  There is also an easy <br/>\nout.   IF a child did actually want to smoke and continued to insist on <br/>\nit.... There are legal considerations.  Persons under 18 can not buy <br/>\ncigarettes.. AND. ( copied from a &quot;legal stuff web page&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may seem odd, but it is not illegal for kids under 19 years of age to <br/>\npossess cigarettes or to smoke them. However, it is illegal for anyone to <br/>\nsupply or sell cigarettes to kids under 19 years of age.<br/>\n<br/>\nSOO, if you give your child a cigarette, you are breaking the law.   Of <br/>\ncourse,  I wouldnt just use that as a first response,  but, it is valid.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70001,"nextTopicId":69983}}
