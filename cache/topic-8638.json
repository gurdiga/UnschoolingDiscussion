I have a friend with LBS who has done vitamin K shots from time to \ntime, but I was diagnosed several years ago and have never had them. A lot of \ntimes it can be controlled through diet (you&#39;ve alredy found that to some \ndegree). You should probablly ask your GP for her/his opinion.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Amy</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- \n<div style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;\"><b>From:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moocow@...\" title=\"moocow@...\">Dia Garland</a> </div>\n<div><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\"\n title=\"unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> </div>\n<div><b>Sent:</b> Thursday, May 25, 2000 7:10 AM</div>\n<div><b>Subject:</b> [Unschooling-dotcom] hypoglycemia</div></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">How were you diagnosed with this?&nbsp; I have \nsuspected that I have this for a number of years, but due to a &quot;doctor phobia&quot; \nhave not sought treatment.&nbsp; I am afraid that I will be poked repeatedly \nwith needles! &lt;g&gt;</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">What I noticed first was that I get a severe \nheadache if I go more than 3 hours without eating.&nbsp; If I eat, the headache \ndisappears.&nbsp; I can relate to the other symptoms you listed, but never knew \nthey were signs of LBS.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Dia</font></div>\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n<tt>Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all \nout at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>To \nUnsubscribe: \nmailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com<br></tt><br></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8628,"nextTopicId":8639}}
