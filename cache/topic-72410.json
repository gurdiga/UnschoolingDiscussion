I was telling <br/>\nhim how I loved college, it was such an enlightening experience and <br/>\ntime for me.  Of course, I had to add that I also needed alot of <br/>\nenlightenment..LMAO!  My parents were not too open minded and <br/>\nalthough I was the black sheep I was still pretty rigid.  IT was a <br/>\nwonderful time for me to explore different topics, classes, some <br/>\nthings that may have seemed &quot;UGH&quot; at first that I loved.  Big shift <br/>\nin thinking for me at this time!<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, the next train of thought was hopefully my kids will <br/>\nexperience this before they get to that age.  Maybe they won&#39;t need <br/>\nso much enlightenment! I am really quite comfortable with my kids not <br/>\ngoing to college.  My only hope for them is them is they find what <br/>\nthey love and understand that even that will require determination <br/>\nand work.  Of course, if by 18 they have no direction I admit I will <br/>\nbe a wreck, but they are 2 and 4 so I have plenty of time!<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nAnyway, interesting how college has this *unschooling* quality where <br/>\nyou can take classes that are of interest to you (besides the <br/>\nrequirements) and most often direct your own learning in that you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have attendance, etc.  Of course, this is if you are not <br/>\nfollowing a specific career track that truely interests you.  What <br/>\nhappened to the wonderful respect of Humanities degrees? I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink unschooled kids need that college time to *grow up* or *find <br/>\nthemselves*, hopefully by that age they have already done alot of the <br/>\nground work for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I never did the sororities and such.  No regrets there, to me <br/>\nthat was another pecking order system.  Any group that needs hazing, <br/>\neven in moderate forms, is copying the structure of much of the <br/>\nparenting that goes on and the schooling that they were exposed to.  <br/>\nOf course, this is just my experience with it so maybe someone from <br/>\nthe inside may have a more in depth understanding. <br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\nGosh, I got long winded there!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/5/03 5:03:17 PM, rubyprincesstsg@a... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Do you think (and this is for anyone who wants to respond) that <br/>\ncollege is <br/>\n&gt; all about careers and schooly things?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well it was also about drugs and staying all night in the boys&#39; <br/>\ndorm and <br/>\n&gt; meeting homeless drugged out freaks who told glorious long lies, <br/>\nand alcoholic <br/>\n&gt; panhandlers of different ethnicity, and flashers and learning that <br/>\nif a <br/>\n&gt; panhandler borrowed a baby she got more money in a flash.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still in contact with a couple of my professors, and several of <br/>\nmy <br/>\n&gt; friends from then.
