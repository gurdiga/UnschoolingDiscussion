I have three little ones 6,4, and 2 and they all have chores<br/>\n  &gt; they have to do. They have to keep their rooms clean, help with laundry.My<br/>\n  &gt; oldest has other chores she does: feed the animals, help set the table and<br/>\n  &gt; help clear it after every meal. She does not get allowance for doing her<br/>\n  &gt; bedroom and laundry, but she does get $0.25 a week for the rest of the<br/>\n  &gt; stuff.<br/>\n  &gt; Hope this helps,<br/>\n  &gt; Carrie<br/>\n<br/>\n  We don&#39;t do the chores thing, rather we all work together to keep the house<br/>\n  under control.  Since I&#39;m the parent home all day and I care the most about<br/>\n  its appearance, I do much of the work, but certainly not all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My dh does laundry when he&#39;s around, and helps clean some on the weekends.<br/>\n  Tim picks up his room as needed, or I&#39;ll help if it gets beyond him.  I<br/>\n  almost always reshelve books, because that&#39;s a task that&#39;s hard for him yet.<br/>\n  Tim will do most anything upon request, and has certain things he likes to<br/>\n  do.  His favorite at the moment is moving all the little stuff in the house<br/>\n  so I can vacuum around it.  Stuff like baskets, rocking horse, etc.  He also<br/>\n  helps clear the table, likes to help in the kitchen (sometimes), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He gets a little over $5 a week allowance (5 euros, we&#39;re in Germany), which<br/>\n  he puts 50 cents in the plate at church and 50 cents into his charity jar.<br/>\n  Eventually we&#39;ll send that to a charity of his choice, but it isn&#39;t full yet<br/>\n  and that was his goal.  The other 4 euros is his to spend, save, give, etc.<br/>\n  I&#39;m pleased to see that he&#39;s already learning to make good savings<br/>\n  decisions.  I buy all sorts of stuff for him, but not toys or stuffed<br/>\n  animals or the little sorts of things that kids often want.  He may choose<br/>\n  to buy them for himself, and occasionally does, but most of his pocket money<br/>\n  goes into savings.  He dips into that to spend the occasional large sum on a<br/>\n  coin (he&#39;s a coin collector), but mainly he is a miser!  His allowance is<br/>\n  not based on behavior at all; it&#39;s his even if we&#39;ve had a rough week.  (I<br/>\n  get to buy my choice of groceries even if my dh and I have had a big<br/>\n  disagreement, so I figured that&#39;s only fair!)<br/>\n<br/>\n  For the record, he&#39;s also 6 years old.  We decided on the amount of his<br/>\n  allowance based on the ice cream truck.  :)   Tim was asking for icecream<br/>\n  every day, and I didn&#39;t want to necessarily buy it ever day.  So we started<br/>\n  discussed it, and decided that giving him the icecream money at the<br/>\n  beginning of the week, for him to choose if he wanted to spend it or not, or<br/>\n  if he wanted something more tangible for his money than icecream was his<br/>\n  choice.  (We also discussed where we spend our money, and he decided he&#39;d<br/>\n  like to tithe the church and charity, too.)  I do occasionally buy us both<br/>\n  icecream, and he&#39;ll sometimes ask for one when we&#39;re out and about, and I&#39;m<br/>\n  happy to buy.  But having money to spend has let him figure out what he<br/>\n  really wants and what is less important to him.  My concept is that he&#39;ll<br/>\n  get significantly more money as he gets older, and likely he&#39;ll budget that<br/>\n  to buy more of his own stuff.

I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t insist that my daughter do any chores. She helped out when she <br/>\nwanted to but I didn&#39;t pay her. Keeping the house clean was important <br/>\nto me, not to her. I didn&#39;t think it was fair to make her keep her <br/>\nroom clean because that was how I liked it. It was her room to keep <br/>\nas she pleased. She did ask me to help her clean it once in awhile <br/>\nand we usually had fun organizing it all. She also gave me permission <br/>\nto clean it if it ever got so bad I couldn&#39;t stand it. She is now 21 <br/>\nand living on her own (with a roommate) and keeps her house nice. She <br/>\ndoes all of the cooking, laundry, cleaning and vehicle upkeep without <br/>\nanyone nagging her. I am so thankful that I didn&#39;t turn chores into <br/>\nan issue when she was younger. We only have great memories to look <br/>\nback on now, not memories of me nagging her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did give her an allowance weekly. I doubled every dollar that she <br/>\nput into her savings account so she was adamant about saving. I <br/>\nlooked at an allowance as giving her some independence. It&#39;s not like <br/>\nshe could get a job. She is now very frugal with her paychecks.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Kim&quot; &lt;sinclai@E...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; My girls are now 11 and 15.
