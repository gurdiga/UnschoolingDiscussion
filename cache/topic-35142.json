I think as<br/>\n&gt; you go you will figure out ways that work customly for you and the<br/>\n&gt; children.  We are constantly changing how we do things as we listen to<br/>\n&gt; one another and figure out what is working and what isn&#39;t working.  I<br/>\n&gt; agree, unschooling is a joy.  And it&#39;s not just for the older ones.<br/>\n&gt; Well, I think 4H is zoology and and socialization.  It also involves a<br/>\n&gt; lot of reading.  Having animals, I assume you&#39;ve needed the vet?  You<br/>\n&gt; might ask the vet if Chaelene could hang out at the clinic once in a<br/>\n&gt; while or on a regular basis.  I forgot how old she is, and I suppose it<br/>\n&gt; would depend on if you felt it were safe?<br/>\n&gt; I would call unschooling &quot;interest led learning&quot; or &quot;interest based<br/>\n&gt; curriculum&quot; so that it doesn&#39;t sound like they are not learning when you<br/>\n&gt; talk to people who can&#39;t hardly accept homeschooling, much less &quot;no<br/>\n&gt; requirements&quot;.  My husband doesn&#39;t really get unschooling, because he was<br/>\n&gt; brainwashed by ps to think he was stupid, so he is afraid for his kids to<br/>\n&gt; be stupid, and thinks they should be gifted and advanced students or<br/>\n&gt; something.  So I just keep giving him testimonies and reasoning that<br/>\n&gt; support unschooling philosophy.
