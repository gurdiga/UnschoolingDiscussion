I&#39;d love to hear stories of how other mothers <br/>\nmade the adjustment to family living from career. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Wini! There is a book called Sequencing. I have never read it but it is <br/>\nsupposed to be pretty good. About having it all, but maybe not all right <br/>\nnow. <br/>\nKathy &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a mothers group called FEMALE that was started in order to help moms with this.  In fact I think the woman who wrote the sequencing book is a member of FEMALE.  Female is a national group and it stands for Formerly Employed Mothers At Loose Ends (it used to be Leading Edge).  They are going to be changing their name this spring.  I think it&#39;s going to be sequencing mothers or something like that.  BTW sequencing just means going from full time work to maybe full time mom back to parttime when the kids get a little older to maybe full time again...just for example.  It really is an excellent book for those moms who are having a hard time adjusting to full time mother.  I know I did.  Which is part of the reason I started my very part time home based business.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!
