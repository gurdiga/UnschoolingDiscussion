I <br/>\nprepared myself for a battering...and it is essentially what I got <br/>\nin a &quot;polite&quot; manner.  I was considering taking my son to the school <br/>\nto still receive speech and OT services.  Prior to my unschooling <br/>\ndecision I was going to also take him for reading and math services <br/>\n(more husband&#39;s concern), but had been leaning away from that.  They <br/>\nmade it clear to me that they were totally baffled by my decision <br/>\nand could not understand how I expected anything to work with them.  <br/>\nThe principal came in and gave her speech about &quot;when education came <br/>\nalong, we were moved off the farms, and while it is nice to spend <br/>\ntime at home with your mother, we got away from that.&quot;  I stood my <br/>\nground that my decision was a sound one.  Under the guise of the <br/>\nwords, &quot;I respect your decision&quot; the condescending tone was clearly <br/>\nfelt.  I was told that her thoughts on homeschooling was basically <br/>\nthat &quot;it stinks.&quot;  I explained my sons symptoms and plummeting self-<br/>\nesteem and I received the &quot;Oh we don&#39;t let that happen and when we <br/>\nsee inappropriate things...we...&quot;  I was also told that my son was <br/>\nalready placed in a classroom and that they had a grand plan for <br/>\nhim, but with so many 3rd graders, the special needs must be grouped <br/>\ntogether to better accomodate the special needs team.  By the end of <br/>\nthe meeting the principal told me that if I could get my son&#39;s self-<br/>\nesteem back up she would like to see him back in school by the mid <br/>\nterm and that if he is too far behind they can just put him in 2nd <br/>\ninstead of 3rd.  I feel like holding my breath!  My son&#39;s 2nd grade <br/>\nteacher(from last year)gave me the speech on socialization.  &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>\nmake him a loner so that he sees himself as different because of <br/>\nthat.&quot;  What part did they not hear??  I guess I shouldn&#39;t have been <br/>\nthere at all.  I thought it would be important to at least get <br/>\nspeech and OT, but I don&#39;t even know about that now.  When I <br/>\nmentioned him coming in 1 time per week, the principal told that <br/>\nwould be babysitting and she wouldn&#39;t agree to it, so I said none at <br/>\nall.  We spent the rest of our day playing...at the youth center <br/>\nwhile the kids prepared for gymnastics, I watched the adult <br/>\nsupervision greet the incoming children (ones at school all day) <br/>\nwith a &quot;YOU GOT HOMEWORK?  I DON&#39;T WANT NO NOISE!&quot;  And as I looked <br/>\nat the resident hamster with my kids I tiptoed past the noiseless <br/>\nkids trying to fill out one more worksheet or one last <br/>\nassignment...and a child whispered to me &quot;is slack a word?&quot;  I <br/>\nnodded and felt sorrow for their circumstances.  As we left the <br/>\nhomework room, I saw a poster on the wall with the title, &quot;10 Global <br/>\nImperatives for Children&quot;, as I scanned through them, I got stuck on <br/>\nnumber 7, &quot;Education for the children, every child, boy or girl, <br/>\nshould be allowed to learn.&quot; And that was it.  <br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nMichelle, Devin & Madelaine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31332,"nextTopicId":44361}}
