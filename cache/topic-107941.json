I looked into my need to say these words and realised that I believed that I was warding off potential disaster - indulging in a bit of superstition. I had to smile. I still smile. And I still say &#39;drive carefully&#39; or &#39;be safe&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally like the &#39;be safe&#39; statement better. My children react better to that one. I&#39;ve also talked to them about why I say it - talked about my fears, my insecurities, the superstition (touch wood) aspect of saying it aloud. They didn&#39;t like the thought that I wasn&#39;t 100% confident in their driving ability, and I hedged by saying that most accidents are caused by the &#39;other&#39; guy on the road. The more experienced they get with driving the more they understand that most accidents are really caused by inattentiveness and overconfidence (in ones&#39;s driving ability and in the car&#39;s ability to perform perfectly in all situations, or to simply hang together).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I remember I let my kids now why I say or do the things I do. Most of the time most of us simply assume that we know why our family members or friends say and do things, and sometimes this is accurate but sometimes it&#39;s not. I find that being clear about motive diffuses a lot of relationship issues based on miscommunication. <br/>\n <br/>\nwishing you peace and prosperity, <br/>\nBeverley Paine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com\">http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com</a> and <br/>\nAlways Learning Books - www.alwayslearningbooks.com.au <br/>\nPO Box 371, Yankalilla 5203 South Australia<br/>\n<br/>\nSend a self-addressed, stamped envelope for a free getting started <br/>\nwith homeschooling information newsletter to the above address.<br/>\nRead latest Homeschool Australia blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hablog.beverleypaine.com\">http://hablog.beverleypaine.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com\">http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com</a><br/>\nReceive regular tips about how easy homeschooling can be, as well as book reviews:<br/>\nemail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dailyhomeschoolingtips-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">dailyhomeschoolingtips-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Last night my nephew called.   Holly took the call.   He was calling to say <br/>\n  he and his friend were going to drive home (100 miles) instead of coming to our <br/>\n  house to sleep, after Ozzfest.   Holly was polite, asked a couple of <br/>\n  questions, and then said &quot;Okay.   Bye.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  After she hung up I suggested that maybe next time someone said he was going <br/>\n  to drive a hundred miles in the dark she might say &quot;Drive carefully&quot; or &quot;be <br/>\n  safe.&quot;   I said &quot;What you said was really nice, though.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\n  Just one little coaching moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108066,"nextTopicId":108068}}
