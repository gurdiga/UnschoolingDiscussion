I am not necessarily fabulous with web design, but I am good at organizing grades, writing and grading tests etc. and assisting with student questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also sell Longaberger baskets, where I often happen to have a party at just about the time when I need to pay a bill - like the car insurance or something. I find Longaberger has a better profit margin because the product is expensive and therefore sales are higher in general. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also am a distributor for Starlight International, which makes all natural, herbal products. My girlfriend found out about them from her nurse practitioner, when her 1 year old was constantly sick, and medical science seemed unable to figure out why. She gave him these children&#39;s antioxidants, which helped his system overall... and he stopped being sick continually. I decided to use some of their overall female wellness products, and my husband was using their weight loss program, as well as my kids taking the children&#39;s antioxident as well, so it became cheaper to become a distributor and buy the items I use at cost. Others have asked about them - and it has just grown from there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, this seems too long - there are many options out there... as well as working part time or different shifts, I think the key is find out what you are good at - and make it work for you. Can you offer a class in - photography, sculpture - whatever to other homeschoolers? (or schooled kids for that matter) - are you good at crafts? Try making things and selling them on Ebay...  <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of these in themselves may be enough - but a combination may help you out of your spot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this was helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ElissaJC@...\">ElissaJC@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, March 14, 2002 10:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Help/?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Please remember that this is going to be my personal opinion and I make no<br/>\n  judgements upon you whatever you may decide!<br/>\n  I would do whatever it took to NOT work outside the home, in a regular full<br/>\n  time day job.<br/>\n  I would work nights (say a 3-11 shift), my twelve year old could be alone<br/>\n  during that time.<br/>\n  I would sell Tupperware, Longaberger baskets, pampered chef, Stampin&#39; up! or<br/>\n  one of the many direct marketing businesses out there.
