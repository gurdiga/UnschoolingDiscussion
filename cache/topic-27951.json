When the kidlets were little I heard the mil<br/>\nfrom h*ll carping &quot;what are you doing, running a cafeteria.&quot;  Eldest kidlet<br/>\nonly liked (gag warning &lt;g&gt;) over cooked pasta with ketsup on it, chicken<br/>\nand weird things like heart and brussel sprouts.  Eldest son wanted exotic<br/>\nfoods like smoked oysters, sardines, anchovies and all types of sea foods.<br/>\nOf course, it couldn&#39;t be simple.  Eldest kidlet absolutely refused to eat<br/>\nany fish and eldest son would not under any circumstances eat chicken.  Then<br/>\nalong comes son #2.  As a tiny tot he liked things like mushroom soup and<br/>\ncapers.  Then along comes son #3.   He was a blue baby and for two years had<br/>\ncolic and sleep apnea.  One day a food would be o.k. and the next he would<br/>\nbe violently ill.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I ran a &quot;cafeteria&quot; until they were old enough to do their own cooking.<br/>\nBig deal, unlike Peg, I can use all four burners at once &lt;g&gt;  Thank goodness<br/>\nthe last two were not as fussy.  Well, unless you count that youngest has to<br/>\nread every single solitary label and if it has something she doesn&#39;t know or<br/>\nsounds like a chemical in the list of ingredients then it is not allowed in<br/>\nthe basket!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have vegan friends and the kidlets help plan and prepare the meals when<br/>\nthey visit.  They understand and have no problem eating someone else&#39;s way<br/>\nwhen they visit.  They don&#39;t consider that forced choices, just doing<br/>\nsomething for someone they like.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoungest kidlet (9 yo) is a peanut butter &quot;nut.&quot;  I mean, she&#39;d have peanut<br/>\nbutter for breakfast, lunch and dinner if we weren&#39;t having other things she<br/>\nliked as well!  I asked her what she thought about the whole peanut allergy<br/>\ndiscussion and whether it would bother her to not take a pb&h sandwich to<br/>\nthe park and she gave me one of those &quot;that&#39;s a dumb question&quot; looks and<br/>\nsaid &quot;of course not, why.&quot;  A little later she came in with a really sad<br/>\nlook and said &quot;Does that mean there are people who care about a dumb<br/>\nsandwich more than a little kid?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 18, 2001 12:26 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Re: Food, allergies, and such<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/18/2001 1:41:03 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Actually,  I&#39;m using a basically hypothetical example here to discuss<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *issue*.
