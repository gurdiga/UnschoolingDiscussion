Amy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Amy,<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you looking for menu ideas or help balancing a basic meal?  My son (6<br/>\nyears) is a vegetarian, and I use the food pyramid, loosely.  We think of<br/>\nproteins heavily in terms of beans, cheese/milk products, tofu, TVP, peanut<br/>\nbutter and such, and just ignore the meat.  We&#39;ve learned that no matter how<br/>\nmuch starch and veggies my son eats, he&#39;s hungry in an hour if I don&#39;t load<br/>\nsome protein into him along with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you searched calcium on Goggle?  There are a LOT of foods with calcium<br/>\nin them, including some you probably eat every day and never think of as<br/>\nhaving calcium.  I was worried about iron, but as my new (and much better!)<br/>\ndoctor pointed out, it&#39;s not like my 6 year old son is a menstruating<br/>\nfemale, and they&#39;re generally the ones that have iron deficiency problems!<br/>\n<br/>\nI bruise easily, and so does my son.  I eat meat, he doesn&#39;t.  If you have<br/>\none child that bruises particularly easily or badly, perhaps it&#39;s something<br/>\nto run by the doctor sometime.  But if you all bruise easily, maybe you have<br/>\nfair skin and it just shows bruises more.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking for recipes that help you plan meals, drop me a line off<br/>\nthe list and I&#39;ll see if I can help.  I had a number of vegetarian recipes<br/>\nbefore my son became a vegetarian, but I have lots more now.  It&#39;s been fun<br/>\nto search out new recipes.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\nwho served peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes tonight for dinner!<br/>\nprotein, starch, and fun, all in one!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45354,"nextTopicId":45360}}
