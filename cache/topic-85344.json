It might satisfy her urge, but she&#39;d still be at home.  It might be <br/>\nfun or it might not be, but it wouldn&#39;t involve all the clothing travel <br/>\nexpense <br/>\nand exposure of school itself, nor involve you the mom in the <br/>\nteaching/organizing/approving of stuff.<br/>\n********************<br/>\nI missed somehow how old your daughter is, but there are some cool, free <br/>\ncourses through Barnes and Noble online. You might have to help her if she&#39;s <br/>\nyounger. But there&#39;s a big range of topics...pretty cool. My son did part of a <br/>\nCivil War thing, and I did a Writing thing.
