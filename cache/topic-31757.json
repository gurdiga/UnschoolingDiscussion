I realize that when I first decided the<br/>\nunschooling route is the one for me and my family...because it fits with my<br/>\nunderstanding of how people grow and learn....that I wasn&#39;t a &#39;complete&#39;<br/>\nunschooler&#39; because I needed to grow into it.  I needed to de-school myself<br/>\nfrom all the mainstream ideas,  from all the years of schooling I have,  uh,<br/>\nendured? (LOL),  from my wants and agendas for my children.  Even after<br/>\n&#39;getting it&#39;  in my brain,  and thinking I understood and &#39;lived<br/>\nit&#39;....sometimes things didn&#39;t work how *I* wanted them to.....at times I<br/>\nbecame frustrated.  This list became an outlet for some of these<br/>\nfrustrations at times....when I realized getting them out here would enable<br/>\nme to not subject the youngsters to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast fall....after spending much time examining my own behavior and<br/>\ninteraction with the children,  and noticing there resistance times were<br/>\ntimes I tried to impose my agenda.....even when I didn&#39;t consciously mean<br/>\nto....well,  I was able to make what I felt was a leap into full<br/>\nunschooling.  And from that perspective,  began to see problems with the<br/>\n&quot;boxed&quot; aproach,  where parts of life or parts of families are &#39;boxed&#39; into<br/>\na special category and neede to be treated differently.  I though that those<br/>\npeople maybe hadn&#39;t made a full leap.<br/>\n<br/>\nguess I don&#39;t want to be too presumptuous here....not saying I don&#39;t have a<br/>\nlot to learn,  I do {I&#39;m always learning,  if you all can live with that<br/>\nhere &lt;sheepish grin&gt; :-) }<br/>\n<br/>\n**Then, I stop and think about the ones that aren&#39;t so lucky. The ones that<br/>\ndon&#39;t have internal support, or even have internal &#39;abuse&#39;. Should they<br/>\nnow not be able to unschool because they can&#39;t fit their life into all<br/>\nthe requirements?**<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting wording...&#39;requirements&#39;  seems like an oxymoron in regard to<br/>\nunschooling.  I suppose attempts to unschool or &#39;close to unschooling&#39; would<br/>\nbenefit the children more than....either try to unschool or just go use a<br/>\ncurriculum (is that the &#39;opposite of unschooling even?)   I sometimes read<br/>\nabout a continuum from unschooling to &#39;relaxed approach,  to strict<br/>\ncurriculum to....spartan military camp (!)...is it a continuum?  I&#39;m not<br/>\nsure really.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**But what about the ones that made some wrong choices in the past, and now<br/>\nwant to unschool. Shouldn&#39;t they be able to come here and say &#39;I&#39;m<br/>\nunschooling as most as I can&#39; without being challanged as to there is no<br/>\nsuch animal?**<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, for me,  it was unschooling ...even when I had a ways to go to fully<br/>\nunderstanding it.  When I became aware that what I was sometimes doing  was<br/>\n&#39;not&#39;  unschooling, (as in unwittingly trying to impose my agenda),   then I<br/>\nrealized hwere my struggles had come from and became a more complete<br/>\nunschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I may get into a rut now and again where I lose awareness of how<br/>\nthings are going and unwittingly interfere with unscholing.  That&#39;s why it<br/>\nseems to me to be a way of life that&#39;s fully integrated into who I am....and<br/>\nrequires of me that I try to remain *aware*  and present to whether or not<br/>\nmy ego is getting in the way of someone&#39;s growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39; a few toughts for ya...<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13139,"nextTopicId":31748}}
