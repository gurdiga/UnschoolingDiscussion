He usually comes up with &quot;sad, mad, hurt&quot;    I ask him if there is anything he wants to do about the situation.. .Sometimes he says &gt;sorry, sometimes he gives the item back, sometimes he says he needs time alone in his room... It seems to depend on his mood and whose involved.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Dawn F<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So what about my hyperactive son?  How do I handle that when it comes to appropriate behavior?  The above scenairo just does not work with him.  Here is an example:<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas snatches a toy away from another child and the child begins to cry.<br/>\n&quot;Thomas, that was not a very nice thing to do.  Look how sad (so-and-so) is.  They would like to finish their turn with that toy&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;NO!  GO AWAY!!!!&quot;  Shouts Thomas<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Please don&#39;t yell at me, Thomas.  You&#39;re not being very nice to us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!&quot;  and either runs away, or falls onto the toy on the floor, protecting it with his body.<br/>\nMother sighs deeply, other child&#39;s parents are annoyed, other child still crying...etc.....<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is exceptionally stubborn, spirited and hyperactive.  HE screams and kicks for all he&#39;s worth when he needs a diaper changed or it&#39;s time to get ready for bed.  All our calm but firm insistence is for naught.  It seems to make no difference to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my younger child, Alex (just 15 months younger than Thomas) is a piece of cake sompared to his brother.  He is easy going, gentle, easy to reason with, etc.  It is VERY hard not to play favorites when Thomas is having one of his difficult days and it is time to choose who gets to go with Mom or Dad to run an errand, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the time, when Thomas is being mean and nasty to his brother (pushing, yelling, taking things) I tell tearful Alex just not to play with him for a while and try to get him interested in something else.  But it hardly seems fair to punish Alex for his brother&#39;s actions by taking him away from the activity in question.  The other half of the time, I have to send Thomas to his room to be alone, as he is just not fit company for other human beings.  He plays quiety in there and often emerges in a better humor.  Sometimes he refuses to come out again, prefering to play by himself after being over-stimulated and over-emotional.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fUPxkAY5lFVro51F_NKyOBApdg5gj4gWfCgTYpsfHDcnd9It_LIU8fsVNcretfhvbEs3PoxVkQNJwfw2YEziybDZr0NDY9P0_MXXL-mHDKHTRjh66g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] honesty  (was homesty - was discipline)  OT","postDate":"962977470","msgId":10768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NjVFQ0NFLjEyMDUzLjM2NTJFNUBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWJmZTgxMyQ3NTA3NTI2MCRjY2VkNGUwY0BiaWxseT4=","referencesHeader":"PDMuMC41LjMyLjIwMDAwNzA3MTA0NzIwLjAwN2I4NmYwQHBvcC5jYW10ZWNoLm5ldC5hdT4="},"prevInTopic":10764,"nextInTopic":10789,"prevInTime":10767,"nextInTime":10769,"topicId":10531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, honestly!!!!

 i personally<br/>\n&gt;would like my son to embody an authority over himself, to value both<br/>\n&gt;himself and others w/out judgment, to reconsider his actions i.e just<br/>\n&gt;because he can doesn&#39;t mean he should.  to ultimately internalize a<br/>\n&gt;blanket of empathy and compassion via thought and reflection for<br/>\n&gt;everything from himself to the environment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;my next thought would be how does this natural show itself?  when he<br/>\n&gt;shares his things, thoughts, feels - parts of himself w/ others.  when<br/>\n&gt;he recognizes the same in another - when he recognizes when others are<br/>\n&gt;sharing parts of themselves w/ him.  when does he not show this?  when<br/>\n&gt;his ego steps in and is no longer a tool which can get him to do<br/>\n&gt;something but becomes the goal - something which needs to be fed.<br/>\n&gt;when he must be smarter, faster, better - winner at whatever.  when he<br/>\n&gt;acts w/out regard for another be it a person, animal, plant,<br/>\n&gt;environment....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;honesty is a core human trait and  i believe is innate in all people<br/>\n&gt;yet extremely fragile.  it is my opinion that all things are possible<br/>\n&gt;and we as parents can enhance or diminish (or push  to the back burner<br/>\n&gt;so to speak:) any trait in our children be it done consciously or<br/>\n&gt;unconsciously.  i guess i believe in the socratic view of vigilant<br/>\n&gt;questioning of oneself and ones actions and believe that to be truly<br/>\n&gt;honest you needs to actively question everything but particularly<br/>\n&gt;oneself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-susan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"cen46624@aol.com","from":"cen46624@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"h-MHoCociLSVeYOOm4dUreMws5Gl0tP1XXTYOWLbYOoymWLa-lofc3ZqL8UQvKZa1klCowDq5g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] homesty (was discipline)","postDate":"962863320","msgId":10681,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3LjRhNTM0YjQuMjY5NTdhZDhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":10667,"nextInTopic":10697,"prevInTime":10680,"nextInTime":10682,"topicId":10531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The topic of honesty and discipline got me thinking of my ds (2)--there have been a few times when he wanted to do something and he knew it wasn t allowed, so","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1620851350\">The topic of honesty and discipline got me thinking of my ds (2)--there have <br/>\nbeen a few times when he wanted to do something and he knew it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nallowed, so he would tell me, &quot;Go inside, mommy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was so sweet and innocent to tell me that so openly.
