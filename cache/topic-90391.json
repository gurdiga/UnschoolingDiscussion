But it&#39;ll give you a starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling Basics<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when he<br/>\nneeds to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural learning&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at home: we do not<br/>\ntry to replicate school in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real<br/>\nworld---for and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re <br/>\nsurrounded by real opportunities every day to learn. And it&#39;s REAL learning, not <br/>\nsimulated as in<br/>\nschool. Living is learning is unschooling is living is learning is<br/>\nunschooling.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and on<br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer in the<br/>\n70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most popular<br/>\nbooks are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and Learning<br/>\nAll the Time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He finally<br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>\nunschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground History<br/>\nof American Education.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and<br/>\nForgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from school. He<br/>\npushes REAL learning---for a purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School and<br/>\nGet a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read for<br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute little<br/>\nstory&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; in <br/>\nthe early<br/>\nfall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers and share<br/>\npassions and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The Unschooling<br/>\nHandbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for documenting<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it&#39;s very <br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\nBut The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new unschoolers. In it she<br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. Convinced my<br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling and the<br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend: The<br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her daughter,<br/>\nLaurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!<br/>\n<br/>\nMagazines:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Home Education Magazine&quot; (known as HEM)<br/>\n&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot; <br/>\n&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt. No longer in <br/>\nproduction, but back issues available from &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from FUNbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWebsites:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.unschooling.com is THE website for unschooling. There are other lists<br/>\nthat &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are <br/>\ntalking<br/>\nabout. There are essays and FAQs which you should definitely read first.<br/>\nAfterwards go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have <br/>\nquestions<br/>\nafter reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things have been explained<br/>\nbefore, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most of your<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe posters to pay attention to are Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Pam<br/>\nSorooshian, Anne Ohman, and Mary Gold. There are other wonderful posters, but<br/>\nthese are all radical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing <br/>\nthemselves and getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling. They will all be at the<br/>\nconference in August.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> is a great e-list if you prefer your <br/>\nmessages in mail form, but the traffic is HIGH. 200-400/day on the Discussion <br/>\nlist. Unless you&#39;re hard core, or just prefer your lists this way, I&#39;d recommend <br/>\nthe message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com</a>. For beginners.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.SchoolsOutSupport.org is the SC unschooling support group. Membership is<br/>\nfree. It has a message board and info about laws and local groups. It hosts<br/>\nthe unschooling conference in August.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 16, 14, & 12 (I<br/>\nthink). She has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories <br/>\nabout<br/>\nunschooling. It&#39;s a great place to start. www.SandraDodd.com/unschooling  She<br/>\nis also the keynote speaker at the August conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare & Luz Shosie have an<br/>\nalready-graduated-from-college-always-unschooled son.

This is a non-age-discriminatory conference: anyone can<br/>\nparticipate in any Funshop or Presentation. Bring the whole family for a<br/>\njoy-filled weekend!<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool&#39;s Out Support (SOS) is a volunteer-driven, statewide organization<br/>\nwhose mission is to support and promote unschooling, provide information,<br/>\nmonitor and influence legislation, offer opportunities for families to get <br/>\ntogether,<br/>\nand empower families to make the choices that respect the rights, needs and<br/>\naspirations of their children. SOS welcomes anyone with an interest in<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince its inception in April 2001, SOS has supported families that have made<br/>\nthe decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and challenges.<br/>\nThese families may wonder about socialization, the legal issues surrounding<br/>\nunschooling, accountability associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s<br/>\neducational philosophy into their everyday lives. Some families may doubt <br/>\ntheir abilities, feel confused and ask themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. SOS <br/>\nencourages<br/>\nparents to trust themselves and their children to make good decisions and<br/>\nempowers them to find the support and information they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Presenters<br/>\nFor our Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular<br/>\ncontributor to Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, and<br/>\nregular columnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd. A former middle <br/>\nschool<br/>\nteacher, Sandra has talked countless families into running away from school <br/>\nand<br/>\njumping into learning for fun. Her motto: &quot;Everything Counts!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also delighted to have Anne Ohman, from the Unschooling.com message<br/>\nboards, back for a return engagement. She &quot;stole the show&quot; last year with her<br/>\ndebut and is now in demand at conferences all over the country. AnneO&#39;s<br/>\npassionate, gentle approach to life and learning continues to inspire families<br/>\ndaily.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian is well known in &quot;all the unschooling<br/>\ncircles&quot;---Unschooling.com&#39;s message boards, the unschoolingdotcom e-list,<br/>\nAlwaysLearning, NHEN, and<br/>\nthe California boards. When she&#39;s not teaching college level economics and<br/>\nstatistics, Pam&#39;s an unschooling mom of three teenagers: she&#39;s &quot;been there, <br/>\ndone<br/>\n<br/>\nthat&quot;---and will surely have a few answers for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Gold is better known as &quot;Zenmomma&quot;--and you can find her wherever<br/>\nunschooling is a topic! Mary &quot;preaches&quot; peace and trust and joy---and the pure<br/>\ndelight of unschooling her children.
