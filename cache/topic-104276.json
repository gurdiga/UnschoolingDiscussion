Not really, I do love him, and he can see things my  way <br/>\na lot.  :)  But sometimes...<br/>\n <br/>\nWe lived next to this really old couple, retired preacher who was always  <br/>\ninviting us to church.  Sweet as anything.  The man slipped on ice and  hit his <br/>\nhead and eventually died.  His wife was bent over from osteoporosis  and could <br/>\nstill drive but I knew it was a strain to get her trash can up to  the top of <br/>\nher long sloping driveway every week.  We hardly ever spoke with  her before <br/>\nhe died, but I took to knocking every once in a while during his  <br/>\nhospitalization, which started January 1st, to see how they were doing.  I  spoke to her so <br/>\nseldom that I didn&#39;t even know until way after Christmas that he  had passed <br/>\non my son&#39;s birthday in November.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut I had begun, right after he fell, to take her trash can to the  curb for <br/>\nher when I was taking mine, and then I would remind my husband or  my son to <br/>\ntake her&#39;s down when they were bringing ours in.  The first time  I did that my <br/>\nhusband was astonished that I would presume to do such a  thing!  He refused <br/>\nto do it that first time, so I did it and then had a  week to argue with him <br/>\nabout why it should be done without even being asked by  her to do it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe didn&#39;t know for months that I was the one who had been doing it,  <br/>\nalthough I think she assumed so.  She rarely spent time in the front of her  house so <br/>\nshe never saw me doing it.  But when we did chance to speak on  occasion, she <br/>\nthanked me.  Will was too little to pull the full one up the  driveway, so he <br/>\nbecame in charge of rolling it empty back down.  He  didn&#39;t need convincing.  <br/>\nOccasionally Charles would do it if he thought  about it, but he was never <br/>\ncomfortable.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThen we sold the house and moved away.  The people who bought the  house had <br/>\n2 teenage sons and so I told them about the trash can and the  situation, and <br/>\nI hope they did it for her, too, without being asked.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was such a simple, convenient good thing to do for someone else.   It <br/>\ndidn&#39;t take anything at all from my life, and it gave Will a sense of  thinking of <br/>\nothers, too.  It was very rewarding for both of us.  I&#39;m  still a little oh, <br/>\nI dunno, peeved is too strong a word--but peeved at my  husband for not being <br/>\ninstantly willing to help someone in need with such a  small, small thing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: community service....was something else","postDate":"1110469682","msgId":104366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzEwMTU0ODAwLldZQ1MxMjI3OC5tdGE5LmFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldEBsZWlnaD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGQwb2Q2aytkM3NxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104343,"nextInTopic":104370,"prevInTime":104365,"nextInTime":104367,"topicId":104276,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just wanted to point out that helping a neighbor in need is also a service to the community.

Sometimes this gets overlooked, but it can be very<br/>\nrewarding to help a neighbor and get to know them a little better. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to read stories of homeschoolers who were doing all these wonderful<br/>\nvolunteer things and I&#39;d kind of feel bad because as much as I wanted to do<br/>\nsomething similar, nothing seemed to fit for us.  My kids don&#39;t enjoy<br/>\nmeeting lots of new people and we work best when we aren&#39;t on a schedule.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut helping a neighbor is very flexible and the kids didn&#39;t find it<br/>\nstressful because they already knew the person.  The neighbor we help is a<br/>\nsingle woman who owns a horse farm.  There is always work to be done and<br/>\nshe&#39;s always in need of some kind of help, no matter when we go there.  We<br/>\nstarted helping her out over a year ago and although we didn&#39;t do it to get<br/>\nsomething out of it, it worked out that when we decided to get a horse, she<br/>\nwas more than willing to barter our services for board for our horse because<br/>\nshe already knew we could do the work.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if anyone is looking to do volunteer work but nothing is working out,<br/>\nsometimes there is someone right in your neighborhood that could use the<br/>\nhelp.  Maybe someone&#39;s house needs painting or their dog needs walking or<br/>\nthey could use some home cooked food now and then.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5370365,"authorName":"Sue Patterson","from":"&quot;Sue Patterson&quot; &lt;Patterson5@...&gt;","profile":"pattrsn40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: community service....was something else","postDate":"1110423572","msgId":104343,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwb2Q2aytkM3NxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzA4MTgwNzM4Ljc1MDUzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjIxMzIyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104294,"nextInTopic":104366,"prevInTime":104342,"nextInTime":104344,"topicId":104276,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"nancy sebastian  wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-439185318\">nancy sebastian &lt;squirlygirl1970@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;who does not want to do anything but play video games and play on <br/>\nthe computer all day.does anyone have any suggestions on how i can <br/>\nget him motivated into doing something else.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n- Don&#39;t ban the video games/computer... involve yourself with them<br/>\n- Engage the child in a conversation about what he&#39;d like to learn. <br/>\nThen help him find it. <br/>\n- Look for interesting options in your community<br/>\n- Set up a movie marathon that might be interesting to both you and <br/>\nyour son<br/>\n- Ask for help in the garden, or whatever your Spring hobby might be<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;i have a daughter who wants to do 4h but can&#39;t seem to get them <br/>\nto work with us. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA chronic problem in 4H is lack of 4H project leaders.

I<br/>\nfound stories on the internet about kids doing wonderful things, and it<br/>\nappealed to them.  They wanted to really DO something useful/helpful/etc. <br/>\nSo, together, we came up with monthly ideas and tried to figure out who&#39;d<br/>\ndo it with us. (And we also chose things that if no one joined us, we&#39;d be<br/>\nok with that). Initially, we plugged them into the 4H calendar for the year<br/>\n(they were thrilled to have someone take the ball and run with it - and,<br/>\nlater I discovered that saying we&#39;re *with* 4H, opens a lot of doors for<br/>\ndonations around here...) <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter we planned out some stuff, we discovered a national group of<br/>\nhomeschoolers doing community services: HEARTS. And we started coordinating<br/>\nour efforts with them - and even started our own little North Texas HEARTS<br/>\ngroup.  (It&#39;s blended with the 4H-ers, but it&#39;s all kids interested in<br/>\ncommunity service.) <br/>\nHere&#39;s the link to the HEARTS group - if you think you&#39;d like to get<br/>\ninvolved with that: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.h-e-a-r-t-s.org\">http://www.h-e-a-r-t-s.org</a>  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut the things my kids have done so far:<br/>\n     September- Habitat for Humanity<br/>\n     October - Teens Make a Difference Day<br/>\n     November - Highway Cleanup & Hats for the Homeless<br/>\n     December - Salvation Army handouts for Christmas (Toys for Tots, etc.)<br/>\n    January - Soup Kitchen at the shelter on New Year&#39;s Eve<br/>\n     February - Valentines for nursing home<br/>\n     March - Project Linus (blanket making)<br/>\n                   Rivers & Streams...trail maintenance<br/>\n     April (anticipated) - Special Olympics<br/>\n                    National Trash Off Day - highway cleanup<br/>\n     May (anticipated) - Relay for Life...all-night team relay walk for<br/>\ncancer awareness<br/>\n <br/>\nMy point in listing all this out is that *for us* this is how our kids are<br/>\ninvolved in the community.

Kids want to make a difference -<br/>\nadults do too (if they&#39;re not too tired &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s so rewarding when you<br/>\nhave some project and 17 kids of multiple ages show up simply because they<br/>\nwant to help. It&#39;s rewarding to me as a parent, and it&#39;s rewarding to the<br/>\nkids to know that they CAN make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... less focus on schoolish subjects, more focus on the kids having the<br/>\nsame thing as what makes a full rich adult life. <br/>\n <br/>\nJust something that&#39;s working for us....<br/>\n <br/>\n~Sue <br/>\n <br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104320,"nextTopicId":104346}}
