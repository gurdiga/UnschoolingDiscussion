I need to work to be sure he has <br/>\nsome good snacks readily available, and yes, my DH will help out, but <br/>\nhe is  the wage earner in our family so he needs to be asleep before I <br/>\ndo most nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have mixed feelings about the church issue- I do not want to force <br/>\nchurch on either of my children, but I think I&#39;ve gotten out of balance <br/>\non the issue of choice.  His refusal to go means I or my husband can&#39;t <br/>\ngo at this point (we don&#39;t have anyone available to stay with him on a <br/>\nregular basis Sunday mornings).  So, I can see letting him know we are <br/>\ngoing as a family, and as Sandra suggested, until he can stay home <br/>\nalone he needs to go with us.  This is the only regular family activity <br/>\nwe do that we don&#39;t all enjoy- our other family outings are things <br/>\neveryone loves (camping, movies, parks, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We encourage him<br/>\nto brush his teeth and take his medicine when we are doing our teeth and<br/>\nmedicine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will brush with me, no problem.  It&#39;s when he stays up several hours <br/>\nafter I do and snacks that he forgets.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;On the day before his dad&#39;s going<br/>\nto be home, do you remind him to go to sleep earlier so he can hang out <br/>\nwith<br/>\nhis dad? And on Saturday night, count back eight hours from when he<br/>\nwould need to get up and go to church, and tell him to go to bed then.  <br/>\n  If he&#39;s<br/>\ntoo sleepy, he&#39;ll learn to go to sleep earlier.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried this, and he will say he is just not sleepy.  I can <br/>\nunderstand this- if I am used to going to sleep at a certain time, say <br/>\n11 pm, often times I am just not sleepy earlier in the evening.  In his <br/>\ncase, after several nights of staying up until 2 or 3 am and then when <br/>\nI ask him to go to bed at 11 pm or midnight, he will say he just isn&#39;t <br/>\nsleepy, will lie in bed a while, I&#39;ll give him a backrub and lay with <br/>\nhim, but most of the time he will get back up.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Your rule now seems to be that parents won&#39;t tell your older child <br/>\nwhen to go<br/>\nto sleep.   His &quot;right&quot; to stay up is the priority, more important than<br/>\nchurch, more important than being with his dad.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re right, Sandra.  Again, I think in my zeal to let go of <br/>\ncontrols on him, I have let the pendulum swing completely to the <br/>\nopposite end (I don&#39;t know if you remember, but you were gracious <br/>\nenough to correspond via email with me last February when I was <br/>\nstruggling with tv and letting go of controls on it.  Along with <br/>\ndropping the tv controls, I dropped the bedtime controls.).  While he <br/>\nis still young and needs someone home with him and fixing him the <br/>\nmajority of his meals and making sure he&#39;s keeping up with oral care, <br/>\nhe probably needs to be more in sync with us on the sleep times.  I <br/>\nknow also he misses being with me and his dad, and would love for me to <br/>\nstay up and watch with him.  With a younger child who wakes up early <br/>\nand wanting to be with my husband, I just don&#39;t want to do this on a <br/>\nregular basis.  He has wanted to stay up all night, until the sun comes <br/>\nup, and the other night I said let&#39;s do it.  We made it until 4 am, and <br/>\nthen he said let&#39;s go to bed.  I kind of had my second wind by that <br/>\ntime and I think I could have made it, but I readily agreed.  We <br/>\nsnuggled a lot that night and I got to watch some of his favorite shows <br/>\nwith him and we both really enjoyed being together.  So, I know he <br/>\nreally needs this time with us, and he is not getting it when he is <br/>\nalone and awake hours after the rest of the house has gone to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other thoughts?  I guess I am still sorting out in my mind to some <br/>\nextent the issue of control versus family lifestyle/rights, needs, and <br/>\nwants of everyone being considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much,<br/>\nStacy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, October 27, 2005, at 02:12 PM, Deb wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Stacy Sargent<br/>\n&gt; &lt;momasarg@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  Or, he asks me to cook him food at 10 or 11pm, and<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m just not in the mood to cook when I&#39;m tired and ready for &gt;bed.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He&#39;s not confident with the microwave yet, so won&#39;t heat up food &gt;by<br/>\n&gt;&gt; himself.<br/>\n&gt; This is something that I&#39;ve experienced with DS (7)- and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s simply a desire for my focused attention more than food need (and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes it&#39;s food and sometimes it&#39;s both).

When they got older, 12 <br/>\nand so, they really wanted their own beds, but Holly still falls asleep to a CD, <br/>\nand Kirby has a timer on his TV.   Marty used to watch TV, but now just turns <br/>\nthe lights off and goes to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I said the same thing tonight, and he seemed fine when we made sure we<br/>\nrecorded his shows that were on late at night and he would be missing. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat made a big difference with us in lots of ways, recording things.   Kids <br/>\nwere willing to risk being out of the house &quot;too long&quot; if we had set whichever <br/>\nfavorite show to record.   And after a while they got to the point they might <br/>\nnot even watch the tapes at all (me too, for my own favorites a few years <br/>\nback) and as they got older and more confident there would be reruns (and now, <br/>\nconfident they can see it on DVD later), they cared less.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-One more thing to throw in- my DH really does not like it that older DS<br/>\nstays up late- he feels he misses out on being with my son so much, as<br/>\nDS is usually asleep all morning (my DH is semi-retired, so is home two<br/>\ndays of the workweek), and then stays up hours after my DH goes to bed<br/>\naround 10 or 10:30. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you talked to your son about that?   On the day before his dad&#39;s going <br/>\nto be home, do you remind him to go to sleep earlier so he can hang out with <br/>\nhis dad?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Also, my DH and I enjoy going to church together, but this<br/>\nis really tough when older DS has been up very late, and then<br/>\ncan&#39;t/won&#39;t get up at 8:30 to get ready for church.  He really does not<br/>\nenjoy church right now, but the rest of us do, and one of us ends up<br/>\nhaving to stay home with older DS. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get someone else to stay with him?   If not, I&#39;d just say &quot;Until <br/>\nyou&#39;re old enough to stay home alone, you need to go with us, because dad really <br/>\nwants to go.&quot;   And on Saturday night, count back eight hours from when he <br/>\nwould need to get up and go to church, and tell him to go to bed then.   If he&#39;s <br/>\ntoo sleepy, he&#39;ll learn to go to sleep earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s something scheduled, that should take priority over sleeping <br/>\nwhenever.   There ARE reasons to sleep, and reasons sometimes to plan ahead about <br/>\nsleeping.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could tell your son that staying up as late as he can is as <br/>\narbitrary and inflexible as a 9:00 bedtime, and he&#39;s disrupting your life the same <br/>\nway a traditional by-the-clock bedtime would disrubt his.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-  I&#39;m not expecting him to go every<br/>\nSunday, but once a month would be nice so DH and I could go together.<br/>\n-=-   <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Would be so nice&quot; sounds so wistful for a thing you should JUST DO, I think. <br/>\n    It seems that making dibs on certain things you REALLY want to do as a <br/>\ncouple or as a family and telling him he just needs to go with you is not at ALL <br/>\nunreasonable.   Does he have scheduled things he goes to? (Lessons, scouts, <br/>\nsomething you always take him to?)     He shouldn&#39;t leave you hanging until the <br/>\nlast minute and have control of whether you get to go or not.    You wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ndo that to him, would you?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-  Did I yank back his self-regulating bedtime too abruptly, and should I <br/>\nlet<br/>\ngo of that again,  or would it be best to go with the bedtime for a<br/>\nwhile, see how the recording of shows, toothbrushing, etc., goes, then<br/>\ngradually let go of the bedtime (even if that is over the next couple<br/>\nof years?) -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me more than just a question of sudden or gradual.   I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink moving to unschooling gradually is a good idea when the question involves <br/>\nreading lessons or a curriculum or forced math.   But in either case, I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink the parents (or ANY adults) should do something so drastic without really <br/>\nunderstanding it themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early stage of the idea of relaxing bedtimes, I think it starts with <br/>\npeople coming to discussions like these all tense and frustrated because they <br/>\ncan&#39;t control their kids, and saying &quot;How can I make them go to bed on time?&quot;   <br/>\nAnd the questions and suggestions might involve &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;You don&#39;t HAVE to <br/>\nhave a time,&quot; or &quot;Which is more important--rules or your relationship?&quot;     <br/>\nAll those ideas are good to consider, but to just register &quot;some people don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a bedtime&quot; and declaring that now YOU don&#39;t have a bedtime seems to me to <br/>\nbe replacing one &quot;rule&quot; with another.    <br/>\n<br/>\nYour rule now seems to be that parents won&#39;t tell your older child when to go <br/>\nto sleep.

My younger DS (5 1/2) almost always goes to bed when <br/>\nI do (which is around 11), and we snuggle and read and fall asleep <br/>\ntogether.  Sometimes my DS will come read with us, then get back up if <br/>\nhe is not ready for sleep.  He is very considerate of noise and keeps <br/>\nthe tv volume low, turns out the lights and then crawls in bed with us, <br/>\nor sometimes gets in his own bed after snuggling for just a little.  <br/>\nSometimes he&#39;ll fall asleep in front of the tv (which is in the living <br/>\nroom) and my husband will carry him into bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been going fairly well, except on the nights younger DS wants <br/>\nto stay up late with older DS- then they are loud.  I have pretty much <br/>\nsaid, since we started this, that younger DS needs to come to bed when <br/>\nI do.  Sometimes he&#39;ll really want to stay up, especially if he&#39;s had a <br/>\nlate nap, so I usually stay up later too, then entice him into bed with <br/>\na story and he usually comes to bed without complaint.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started questioning myself, though, when reading some of the posts <br/>\nrelated to Jill&#39;s question.  Was I giving them too much choice at too <br/>\nyoung of an age?  I think I got my answer to that question when my <br/>\nyounger DS said, &quot;but you said we could do whatever we wanted to do&quot; in <br/>\nresponse to my telling him it was time to go to bed last night.  I need <br/>\nto work on gradually letting them have more and more choices, with the <br/>\nunderstanding that those choices might be reduced if certain conditions <br/>\naren&#39;t met.  I let go of bedtimes and tv restrictions last February, in <br/>\nan abrupt way, and I now know I could have been more gradual about it.  <br/>\nAlso, I know it is me that has fostered this environment where they <br/>\nthink they can do whatever they want, and this has led to other <br/>\nproblems away from home (when trying to leave the park or a friend&#39;s <br/>\nhouse, or unacceptable behavior in stores- roughhousing, being too <br/>\nloud, and when I say stop they don&#39;t).<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the bedtime issue, older DS rarely remembers to brush his teeth <br/>\nbefore he goes to bed.  I need to help him more in the morning and <br/>\nduring the day to remember to brush, so at least he&#39;s brushing at least <br/>\nonce a day.  Also, he often does not want to eat when he first gets up, <br/>\nso he&#39;s eating his first food of the day often at 1 or 2 pm, then is <br/>\nhungry all evening, and eats a lot after I&#39;ve gone to bed.  He selects <br/>\npopsicles, popcorn, snacky stuff, and I&#39;m concerned about his food <br/>\nquality, especially when I&#39;m not awake to help him get something he <br/>\nmight prefer if someone were up who could fix it for him (he eats <br/>\nreally well, usually, in terms of veggies, fruits, etc., and can choose <br/>\nwhatever he wants).  Or, he asks me to cook him food at 10 or 11pm, and <br/>\nI&#39;m just not in the mood to cook when I&#39;m tired and ready for bed.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s not confident with the microwave yet, so won&#39;t heat up food by <br/>\nhimself.  Also, I&#39;m concerned that when he stays up really late he gets <br/>\n8 to 10 hours of sleep, usually on the lower end of this range, but on <br/>\nthe nights he has gone to bed before midnight, he&#39;ll sleep 11 hours or <br/>\nso, which has been his normal sleep amount for a couple of years (and <br/>\nbefore we let go of bedtimes; he has always needed a lot sleep).  Also, <br/>\nif he&#39;s falling asleep in front of the tv and not getting himself to <br/>\nbed, is he really listening to his body about sleep?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, last night I told him he needed to come to bed when I did, the <br/>\nsituation was not working due to the toothbrushing and food and sleep <br/>\namount issues!  I wish I had not changed things so abruptly, and with <br/>\nno family discussion or input from him on the matter- my big screwup.   <br/>\nI said the same thing tonight, and he seemed fine when we made sure we <br/>\nrecorded his shows that were on late at night and he would be missing.  <br/>\nHe slept 12 1/2 hours last night, and fell asleep tonight about 10:30 <br/>\nwith little trouble.  He still ate his first food at about 1 pm today, <br/>\nand then had a good dinner and late snack.  We were busy with Halloween <br/>\ncostume making today and tonight, so I did not do as good as job as I <br/>\ncould have getting him some extra food in there during the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing to throw in- my DH really does not like it that older DS <br/>\nstays up late- he feels he misses out on being with my son so much, as <br/>\nDS is usually asleep all morning (my DH is semi-retired, so is home two <br/>\ndays of the workweek), and then stays up hours after my DH goes to bed <br/>\naround 10 or 10:30.  He very much would like us all to be going to bed <br/>\naround the same time, so his sleep and the sleep of my older DS match <br/>\nup better.  Also, my DH and I enjoy going to church together, but this <br/>\nis really tough when older DS has been up very late, and then <br/>\ncan&#39;t/won&#39;t get up at 8:30 to get ready for church.  He really does not <br/>\nenjoy church right now, but the rest of us do, and one of us ends up <br/>\nhaving to stay home with older DS.  I&#39;m not expecting him to go every <br/>\nSunday, but once a month would be nice so DH and I could go together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are planning to look into Tivo, so we can more easily record the <br/>\nshows he enjoys and make sure he doesn&#39;t miss his faves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve read this far, thanks!!!!  I know this is terribly long.  Did <br/>\nI yank back his self-regulating bedtime too abruptly, and should I let <br/>\ngo of that again,  or would it be best to go with the bedtime for a <br/>\nwhile, see how the recording of shows, toothbrushing, etc., goes, then <br/>\ngradually let go of the bedtime (even if that is over the next couple <br/>\nof years?)

They would say they didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; go to bed<br/>\n&gt;&gt; yet, when I was going to sleep with the nursing baby.    Nursing a<br/>\n&gt; baby to sleep<br/>\n&gt;&gt; isn&#39;t something you have to SAY (&quot;Go to bed.&quot;)   They Want to<br/>\n&gt; nurse, and they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; fall asleep.   Often the older sibling will fall asleep then too,<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; there&#39;s soft music or a book being read, and that&#39;s EASY.   But<br/>\n&gt; when one gets old<br/>\n&gt;&gt; enough to want to stay up, and you make a deal with him, know what<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s going<br/>\n&gt;&gt; to be doing, and he knows if he isn&#39;t cool and mature he might be<br/>\n&gt; told no the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; next time, then he&#39;s cool.

Then we play a card game or <br/>\nread or watch tv shows, like I said I need them to stay up late for <br/>\nthis time with them without the little guys around.  (Plus, I get <br/>\nthe morning with the younger two.)  Lights are off or low, when I go <br/>\nto bed and they just stay up watching tv.  If they just got a new <br/>\ngame or something, then they&#39;d probably play that.  Usually they&#39;re <br/>\nin one of their rooms, sometimes they stay downstairs.  They&#39;re not <br/>\nup running around.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they first came home from school, they&#39;d stay up REAL late.  <br/>\nWhich was fine, because things mellowed out as they got used to it.  <br/>\nI had said in the one post that it did feel like they are walking <br/>\nall over me, but when I think about it, it&#39;s more like consideration <br/>\nis the problem.  I don&#39;t really care how late they stay up, I know <br/>\nthey&#39;re okay...they aren&#39;t doing anything unsafe.  It&#39;s just <br/>\nsometimes they get loud chatting or the tv is too loud.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust clarifying a little bit.  Thanks for all the suggestion.

I go to bed when anywhere from <br/>\nmidnight to 2am and get <br/>\nsome time with the little ones before the big ones get up.  (they <br/>\nstay up after me even, though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve recently decided together that after 9pm it&#39;s &quot;quiet time&quot; - <br/>\ncards, <br/>\ncomputer, movies, whatever - just quietly.  I read how Sandra <br/>\nsays &quot;Yes, you can...if you (whatever)&quot;.  I&#39;ve told them &quot;you can <br/>\nstay up, if you&#39;re quiet&quot;.  So, my question is, after you talk about <br/>\nwhy, come up with ideas and they&#39;re still having a hard time being <br/>\nquiet, what do you do?  If they can be quiet they can stay up...so <br/>\nif they&#39;re not quiet, they can&#39;t.  How do I enforce that?  We&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid before, &quot;okay you&#39;re not being quiet, lights out&quot;.  But I feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m punishing them.  Is that okay because its something we all <br/>\nagreed to?  Sometimes they groan, sometimes they agree and sometimes <br/>\nthey come up with another idea (seperating or whatever).  We&#39;ve <br/>\ntried talking about it before bed, what will help you be quiet?  <br/>\nLights out and a movie together?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I&#39;m rambling, last night was one of those nights!  I know <br/>\nthey need time to get used to that freedom and I realize I didn&#39;t <br/>\nstart it off on the right foot by throwing away bedtime, but it has <br/>\nbeen almost a year and the issue isn&#39;t really that I want them to go <br/>\nto sleep, it&#39;s more about consideration, I guess - we need our <br/>\nsleep!
