I&#39;m not sure we are officially unschooling (or is <br/>\nthat an oxymoron?).  We don&#39;t follow a curriculum but we do cover some of the <br/>\nacademics in a sort of orderly way.  We do what works for us.  We create our <br/>\nagenda by waking up.  Sometimes we have planned activities -- today we are <br/>\ngoing to meet Dad for lunch at a wildlife sanctuary and take the tour there <br/>\nand picnic.  Other days we have lessons -- piano and Tae Kwon Do so far.  <br/>\nOther days we spend way too much time on the computer.   My son is taking an <br/>\nonline math course, for instance.  And both kids do lots of different <br/>\nsoftware programs depending on what catches their fancy.  We visit the <br/>\nlibrary about once a week.  Except 2 weeks ago they had a library sale and we <br/>\nstill haven&#39;t plowed thru the stack of books we got there.  My kids are young <br/>\n(5 and 6 1/2) so we do a lot of running around in the yard, going to the <br/>\npark, etc.  My daughter is in to art in an extreme way -- we are amazed at <br/>\nsome of her creations and the way she can see what she wants to create <br/>\nbeforehand and then actually produce it -- I, otoh, cannot draw a straight <br/>\nline.  On the other, other hand, she was asking me to write out some math <br/>\nproblems (we did a maze with add/subtract problems thruout) on her art easel <br/>\nlast nite (and I was lectured because &quot;Mom, I am 5 now, not 4 1/2 -- you <br/>\nthink of me as 4/12 and give me baby problems -- try to imagine what it is <br/>\nlike to be 5.&quot;) -- so who knows what she will be doing next!  We get science <br/>\nexperiments on-line once a week (and usually do them), we go to the zoo, we <br/>\njust took a nice vacation to PA/NY/NJ (leaves!!! deer!!!), etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s a little of what we do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carol D.
