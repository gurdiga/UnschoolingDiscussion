Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;&gt; Hannah Lea Jenner left this life peacefully, in her mother&#39;s arms,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; early on February 24, 2006.   She was 9.5 years old and had a smile<br/>\n&gt;&gt; on her face, as she so often did.   Chemotherapy had just begun for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; her recently diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, but the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; infection too quickly claimed her body.  Hannah was a life long<br/>\n&gt;&gt; learner for whom all experiences came with joy and love.  Survivors,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; grateful for having loved her, are her mother, Diana (Lambert)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Jenner; her brother, Hayden Jenner; her grandparents, aunts, uncles,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; cousins, and countless friends-who-should-be-family.  She is embraced<br/>\n&gt;&gt; on the other side by her father, Mitch Jenner, and others who have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; gone before her.  In lieu of flowers, the family requests outpourings<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of love and tender regard to every child, and gratitude on the part<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of parents of living children everywhere.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112426,"nextTopicId":112432}}
