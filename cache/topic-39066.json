I remember asking, on the AOL boards, <br/>\n&quot;So, when you say your kids learn on their own, do your kids just go to the <br/>\nbookshelf and pick out a math book and start from the beginning and study on <br/>\ntheir own?&quot; Well - unschoolers answered that question in so many different <br/>\nways, but I remember Christine Webb saying, &quot;Yes, that is possible.&quot; Somehow <br/>\nthat indicated to ME that it was also possible that they wouldn&#39;t and THAT is <br/>\nwhat got me really focused on thinking about all the OTHER ways kids might <br/>\nreally learn math, and the rest is history.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39065,"nextTopicId":39071}}
