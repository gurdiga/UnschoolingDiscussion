It <br/>\nwas about dealing with differences with DH just as the subject line <br/>\nstated. IMO the majority of people here have shown much <br/>\nshortsitedness and lack of respect toward the my views as a parent <br/>\nand really offered little support toward what was really rather hard <br/>\nto bring up, Differentces with DH. What have I learned from all this? <br/>\nThis list really isn&#39;t about what everyone thinks about. This list is <br/>\nabout aproximately 400 unschoolers who discuss unschooling and have a <br/>\ngeneral respect of those who do unschool unless they have ever laid a <br/>\nhand on thier child. Then it is about casting out those who are <br/>\ndeemed abusive and shoving your opinions down their throught with the <br/>\nintent, IMO, to remove them from the list. Simply because they &quot;don&#39;t <br/>\nfit the mold&quot;. Sounds pretty PS to me. Oh and by the way you wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve who has posted to me off list to offer support and agree with <br/>\nmy views. I won&#39;t mention who they are simply because they don&#39;t want <br/>\nthe same to happen to them. I guess my point in saying that is to let <br/>\nyou all know that your all &quot;mighty correctness&quot; in the issue is not <br/>\nas agreed upon as you would like to think.

There was abuse left and right and I was the one who received <br/>\nthe brunt of the abuse mostly in the form of emotional and some <br/>\nphysical by my father when I was a teenager. By physical I mean that <br/>\nhe would taunt me till I was fuming mad and then walk away laughing. <br/>\nThis was something that he did to me starting when I was very young. <br/>\nWhen I became a teenager I learned that I had a right to not be <br/>\ntreated this way. The years of emotional abuse came out physically <br/>\nwhen he would do this. He was good at knowing when I had reached the <br/>\npoint of physical anger and when I would walk away he would dare me <br/>\nto come back and fight him. And I did. And although my mother is from <br/>\nan abusive family as well, she was my advocate. With the problems I <br/>\nhad in ps she was the one who stood up for me when I wasn&#39;t able to <br/>\nstand up for myself. In the end it was my mother who was able to <br/>\nacknowledge that she wasn&#39;t perfect and admit to me when she made a <br/>\nmistake in her parenting, and there were many mistakes, however, none <br/>\nthat were as bad as what my father inflicted on me. He, by the way, <br/>\nto this day admits nothing wrong. He sees himself as infalable in <br/>\nevery aspect of his life. The point I am wanting make here and <br/>\ngetting off the subject of is that although I come from a family of <br/>\nabuse, somehow, someway I was able to look at what was happening to <br/>\nme and realize that it was wrong. That this isn&#39;t the way it is <br/>\nsupposed to be. And then figure out how to do it better, I will even <br/>\nsay right. That isn&#39;t to say that I am always right but that the <br/>\nenvironment that I have been able to provide for my children is <br/>\nhappy, loving and not abusive. Meaning, they will never know what it <br/>\nis like to grow up with anything close to what I did. I have been <br/>\nable to figure out how to give them the type of environment I wanted <br/>\nto and deserved to grow up in. How do I know I am doing this with the <br/>\nbackground I just described? I used to wonder that myself. I began <br/>\nlooking at what the &quot;experts&quot; say and suggest and found that I was <br/>\nalready doing the majority of it. This isn&#39;t to say that I am perfect <br/>\nin my parenting skills. It is to say that I don&#39;t have the problems <br/>\nof parenting my children that most survivors of abuse do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do apreciate your openness and your opinion. And thank you for your <br/>\nsensitivity in you last post. To be very honest I was extremely <br/>\noffended by the email you had sent.: ) however, all is forgotten. : ) <br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious as to some of the things you have learned in your class <br/>\nwith DH. How have you come to terms and found common ground with the <br/>\ndifferences you have in your childrenrearing techniques?<br/>\n<br/>\nCorallyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Shannon Nicoletta Manns&quot; <br/>\n&lt;snmanns@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW I did some spanking when my girls where younger, before I knew <br/>\n </span></blockquote>about Aletha Solter&#39;s work and before I joined a Self-Healing Circle. <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t judging you personally.

Corporal punishment is not the only type of child abuse - a <br/>\nlot of emotional abuse goes unnoticed. I have been &quot;guilty&quot; of that, <br/>\ntoo. Realizing that my behaviours originated in my own childhood is <br/>\nnot an excuse or a reason to blame my upbringing, but a place to <br/>\nbegin changing. I am working on it every day. So I would like to join <br/>\nsomeone else here who said &quot;try not to take it personally&quot;. I know <br/>\nthat is not easy sometimes, and I see every day how &#39;taking things <br/>\npersonally and getting defensive&#39; gets in way more than anything when <br/>\nit comes to opening up to change. I thank you, Corallyn, for posting <br/>\nyou original message. In my emotionality I was maybe too quick to <br/>\nreact by sending all the Aletha Solter info (I still think everyone <br/>\ncould benefit from knowing her stuff), without acknowledging that I <br/>\nhave been where you are, Corallyn, and I do hav sympathy for you and <br/>\nyour situation.

He thinks that we need to use more <br/>\ncorporal punishment in the form of a switch, that the hand isn&#39;t <br/>\nenough. Not that I use my hand often, but I do believe there is a <br/>\ntime and a place for it and it is always a last resort. The last time <br/>\nand only time that I seriously used my hand on either of the children <br/>\nwas when DS ran off in the mall and I couldn&#39;t find him. He was <br/>\nalmost 4 at the time. Anyway, to make a long story short, I had <br/>\nsecurity looking for him for 15-20 min. When they found him I bawled <br/>\nlike a baby, held him in my arms then took him to the bathroom and <br/>\nspanked his bare bum till my hand hurt, not out of anger but out of <br/>\nlove. I wanted him to understand how serious it is that he not run <br/>\noff like that. Then I explained to him how scared I was and how much <br/>\nI loved him and sat there in the stall just holding him close for a <br/>\nwhile. Needless to say he has never run off in any store again. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as DH and I go I have always believed more in the lines of <br/>\nLove and Logic and DH believes more along the lines of coersion and <br/>\nforce much like the ps uses. So my question is does anyone have any <br/>\nsuggestions as to how to handle situations that arrise when DH is <br/>\ndealing with the children in a manner that I totally disagree with <br/>\nand the children aren&#39;t used to, simply because they are use to the <br/>\nway I handle things since I am the one who is home all day and night <br/>\nand DH works all day and all night?
