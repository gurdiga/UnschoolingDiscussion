As you might imagine, we have had a long talk<br/>\nwith Chris about opening doors to people.&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t know anybody - ask your state homeschooling organization<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; or you can call the trial lawyers association for your state. Ask your<br/>\n </span></blockquote>state<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; organization for material to provide to your attorney to bring him/her up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; speed on your state&#39;s homeschooling law.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am just now begining to know where to start with all this. I have print<br/>\nouts of the law in my state, in case I need them (which I probably will). At<br/>\nthe moment, a lawyer is out of the realm of my financial abilty. To get a<br/>\npro se lawyer in SC, you have to be on a waiting list and it basically has<br/>\nto be an easy case, from what they told me when I called a few weeks ago,<br/>\nwhen the first investigator showed up. But they put me on the waiting list.<br/>\nIt could be months before I hear back from them. Right now we are waiting to<br/>\nexhale. Mike is applying for social security (He was elcectrocuted on the<br/>\njob in 1999 by a waffle baker at the Waffle House). If it comes through the<br/>\nback pay he is owed will be more than enough to pay for a decent lawyer.<br/>\n<br/>\nDSS has way too much power - far  beyond we would normally think is<br/>\npossible - it is risky to try to face them<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; down on your own. You may not need anything except a phone call or a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>letter<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from your lawyer -- but you never know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope all I will need is a phone call or a letter. This is my second trip<br/>\ndown this road and my want to homeschool my child was just as big a part of<br/>\nit then as it is now. I know how risky this is. Unfortunately, so does my<br/>\nson. We used to whisper in our house until after 3:30pm everyday. That is<br/>\nwhen DSS stops sending out people to investigate. We spent our weekends<br/>\ncleaning house. He had nightmares about being taken away. The school allowed<br/>\nhim to let DSS interview him on three seperate occasions the last time. I<br/>\ndid not know that they can&#39;t do that then. Chris had a nightmare last night.<br/>\nIt will be the last one he has and I really do not care who I have to piss<br/>\noff, mow over or knock out of my way to get all of this to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They&#39;ve already interviewed your son without your permission and you&#39;ve<br/>\n </span></blockquote>had<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them at your door. You don&#39;t say if you let them in and talked to them at<br/>\n&gt; that time or what they say the next step is going to be<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mike showed them in, answered all their questions in a manner that I would<br/>\ncall intimidating as hell. Mike is a big guy who looks like Santa Claus<br/>\ncrossed with a Hell&#39;s Angel. The investigator was this little wet behind the<br/>\nears, just out of school kid who was probably just following orders. I told<br/>\nhim that I had been through this before and that I KNEW he could only make<br/>\none more &quot;drop in&quot; visit during the next 45 days. I told him I KNEW that,<br/>\nwhen he returned, if he found nothing to substaniate their allegations he<br/>\nHAD TO, BY LAW, drop the investigation and I had to be sent a letter giving<br/>\nthe dispensation of the investigation. I did not know any of this the first<br/>\ntime. That is how they got away with so much of this BS the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next step? I mowed my lawn, cleaned my house and washed the rest of the<br/>\nclothes (Actually Mike did most of it while I read, wrote emails and worked<br/>\nwith Chris.) We are not doing anything wrong and all of the things they are<br/>\naccusing me are out right lies. Unless DSS in SC honestly wants to be in<br/>\ncourt with me accusing them of harrassment, falsification of records, libel,<br/>\nslander (which ever one applies in this case) and anything else I can get a<br/>\nrighteously indignant lawyer with a heart of gold to come up with, unless<br/>\nthey honestly want all the local news media splashed with the image of a<br/>\ndisabled mom and her beautiful, bright, well taken care of child pleading<br/>\nfor the understanding and sympathy of other parents in the area... I really<br/>\nthink that if these people are smart enough to trump up charges and make my<br/>\nlife hell then they have to be smart enough to figure that I will turn the<br/>\ntables on them eventually. And God help them if I do because it is going to<br/>\nget nasty. I am sick of running scared.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- but if you think<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there is going to be ANY next step, I know that I would want an attorney.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; DSS didn&#39;t tell you that they were dropping the case, then I think you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>need<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; one now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with you. I am furious but not dense &lt;GGG&gt;. I am just trying to<br/>\nfigure out how to pay for one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrightest Blessings,<br/>\n          Virginia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Religion is what you do so that others will think well of you.

Now that I have decided to keep Chris home, his school<br/>\nprincipal sent DSS to my doorstep bright and early Friday morning. I am<br/>\nbeing &quot;investigated&quot; for abuse and neglect. They state his abscences(four<br/>\ndoctors visits with notes, a three day suspension at their hands, one day<br/>\nwhere he had a doctors appointment but his doctor was having an emergency<br/>\ntonsilectomy and one day he missed the bus), the fact that I could not get<br/>\nhis meds for a week(thus I was denying him medical attention), and he<br/>\nsupposedly came to school &quot;dirty&quot; twice as proof or suspicion that I am<br/>\nguilty of neglect.<br/>\n<br/>\n     To make matters worse, they called the investigator in just as soon as<br/>\nI left their evaluation meeting on Friday and the investigator &quot;interviewed&quot;<br/>\nmy son for about an hour. I did not know this until he told me that the<br/>\ninvestigator was his &quot;friend&quot; and upon further questioning Chris told me<br/>\nabout their interview in glorious detail. He said the man kept asking if I<br/>\nspanked him, if Mike spanked him, if anyone had touched him &quot;someplace<br/>\nbad&quot;... dolls and puppets included.<br/>\n<br/>\n     I know that I am within my rights and that I am not guilty of anything,<br/>\nbut that does not make any of this any easier. The only mention of<br/>\nhomeschooling during his visit here was to say that he could not tell me who<br/>\nhad sent him but that the school considers Chris &quot;high risk&quot; because he<br/>\ntested behind grade (He could not sit still long enough to finish the tests.<br/>\nWhat he did, he scored a perfect 100...no questions missed), needs<br/>\nmedication and they feel that I lack the resources to educate him properly.<br/>\nGeez... How stupid do I look? He didn&#39;t have to draw me a road map.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I&#39;m not whining guys. No matter how thrilled I am to have Chris at home,<br/>\nI knew in my heart of hearts that this would happen. I have no regrets, I am<br/>\njust angry about this. And I am scared, I&#39;ll admit it. Anyone homeschooling<br/>\nin SC has at least heard the rumors of it happening to others if it has not<br/>\nhappened to them. This is harrassment dressed up in the guise of concern for<br/>\nmy child&#39;s welfare by people who are running scared.<br/>\n<br/>\n     There was an article in the Goose Creek Gazette this week where the<br/>\nhead of the department of children at risk, Phyliss Thornwaite, lamented the<br/>\nloss of these children into a system that is not well regulated(read: They<br/>\ncannot control those of us who pick option number three (accountability<br/>\norganizations) I am now a proud member of PACESC as of this weekend. We<br/>\nthreaten their bottom line.) and they fear that the children cannot be<br/>\nproperly assessed to return to mainstream schooling. HOW ARROGANT? Why would<br/>\nI want to put my child back into such a toxic environment now that I have<br/>\nhim out of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n      So I guess there&#39;s not much left to do but wait, get my ducks in a<br/>\nrow, and enjoy my child despite the enourmous stress that I am under at the<br/>\nmoment. At least I got to enjoy a short moment of unfettered joy with my<br/>\nchild before the war started.
