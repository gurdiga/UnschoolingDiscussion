So from sunrise to sunset Fri/Sat the public is more than welcome to attend, costumes are not mandatory but are prefered. From sunset to sunrise Fri/Sat those not in costume will be asked to leave, not sure how it will be inforced but my guess is that most people understand and will respect their wishes. Now Sun. I guess if a different matter You must be in costume to attend and I think it may be for SCA members only or you must be with a memeber to attend. <br/>\nFrom what I understand is that this event started kinda small but as the public learned about it and wanted to attend, and the park saying that they couldn&#39;t completly close off access for the whole weekend and it has now evolved into something quite huge.<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 3/19/03 1:10:55 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Contact the Baron, or whoever is in charge of that Shire/Barony whatever <br/>\nit <br/>\nis and ask about a loan box...usually called the &quot;chatteling box&quot; for <br/>\nvisitors. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Caid, the office is called &quot;Gold Key,&quot; I think.

Or a one-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>day visit to the war, but sometimes that&#39;s expensive, with big-event <br/>\nfees.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking at this time that we will just do the day(s). Is there a <br/>\ndifference between a War and a Renfair? is it just that they are open <br/>\nto different people? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.

We have never taken them camping and we are trying to decide <br/>\nif this is the way to go for our first time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried checking out the different SCA websites for this event and <br/>\nnone of them have &quot;general information&quot; links that are active so, a <br/>\nnewbie like myself can&#39;t find any info. If we go do we have to be in <br/>\nperiod dress? or can we just visit? Do you have to be a memeber to <br/>\ncamp? Is it okay to bring children? All the sites I have found seem <br/>\nto be personal sites for members or just giving info to people that <br/>\nalready understand whats going on, and I don&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo any info would be helpful, we are trying to decide if this is <br/>\nsomething we should get into now, or wait until the kids are a bit <br/>\nolder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks :-) Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61435,"nextTopicId":61347}}
