I told him we<br/>\n  would stop on the way home and have Papa (what they called my fil, their<br/>\n  grandfather) give us some (he owned a butcher shop) so we would have dinner<br/>\n  ready when Uncle got home.  A little while later, Penny (2) asked<br/>\n  &quot;Mamma-Lyn, Mamma-Lyn, stories in bed?&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes, Sweetie, when Uncle<br/>\n  and I go to bed you can cuddle and I&#39;ll read you a story.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Only when I heard a LOUD gasp and turned to see the brigade go stomping out<br/>\n  the door muttering about &quot;can you image a child that age with children . .<br/>\n  .&quot; did I realise what our conversation must have sounded like to a bunch of<br/>\n  old biddies &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Evil and wicked enough that we didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school &lt;&lt;&lt;bewg&gt;&gt;&gt;  My poor fil<br/>\n  would have died if he had known what they must have been thinking!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lynda<br/>\n  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: &quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valfitz@...\">valfitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 10:09 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: mindful parenting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; lol...try being an UNSCHOOLER in the 80&#39;s..

Ya know, unschooling, just having<br/>\nfun.  I was Mamma-Lyn (19) and you should have been there the day the LOL<br/>\nbrigade was there!  One of the LOLs asked why my brothers and sisters<br/>\nweren&#39;t in school.  I said we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school, and being young and having<br/>\na &quot;hippy&quot; moment, I said &quot;all the world&#39;s our school.&quot;  Tony (10) pipes up<br/>\nwith &quot;She&#39;s not our sister, she&#39;s Mamma-Lyn.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking, maybe I better<br/>\nexplain that one but they turned their backs on us with that weaned on<br/>\nvinegar and using a lemon wedge as a pacifer look.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, about then Nicki Jon (6) started asking when we were going home and if<br/>\nwe could have baby chickens (cornish game hens) for dinner.  I told him we<br/>\nwould stop on the way home and have Papa (what they called my fil, their<br/>\ngrandfather) give us some (he owned a butcher shop) so we would have dinner<br/>\nready when Uncle got home.  A little while later, Penny (2) asked<br/>\n&quot;Mamma-Lyn, Mamma-Lyn, stories in bed?&quot;  I said, &quot;Yes, Sweetie, when Uncle<br/>\nand I go to bed you can cuddle and I&#39;ll read you a story.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly when I heard a LOUD gasp and turned to see the brigade go stomping out<br/>\nthe door muttering about &quot;can you image a child that age with children . .<br/>\n.&quot; did I realise what our conversation must have sounded like to a bunch of<br/>\nold biddies &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEvil and wicked enough that we didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; school &lt;&lt;&lt;bewg&gt;&gt;&gt;  My poor fil<br/>\nwould have died if he had known what they must have been thinking!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valfitz@...\">valfitz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 08, 2001 10:09 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: mindful parenting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; lol...try being an UNSCHOOLER in the 80&#39;s..

I hope <br/>\nit&#39;s in your book.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Mindful parenting wasn&#39;t exhausting to me. It was the easiest thing <br/>\n I&#39;ve ever done. If I can offer you one bit of advice... <br/>\n<br/>\nThis, I can&#39;t grasp. It (mindful parenting) is a process for me. First, the <br/>\n&quot;seeing clearly&quot; part. Weeding out memes, the old ways of accepting without <br/>\nquestioning. Then the search for the True ways of parenting, the ways that <br/>\nspeak to my heart. First comes this work, then contemplation, then action. <br/>\nYes, that part, the act of parenting mindfully, is &quot;easy&quot; in that it feels <br/>\nright, knowing we are on the right path together. But without the work part <br/>\n-- the questioning and contemplation -- I would still be mired in &quot;old <br/>\nthought&quot; ways of parenting, doing what &quot;worked&quot; for my parents.<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt; Trust yourself, believe in yourself and have faith that it will be <br/>\n okay. You&#39;re a great mom doing your best. That&#39;s all any of us can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who is a teacher at an elementary school. She works there <br/>\nbecause her son is there. She has her master&#39;s in education and helps to <br/>\nimplement the new &quot;Standards of Learning&quot; tests here in VA. Her son, my son&#39;s <br/>\nbest friend, was a ball of energy, but having trouble sitting at a desk in <br/>\nfirst grade. This showed up in reading where he was &quot;behind&quot; the other kids <br/>\nin his class. (I don&#39;t have to state my opinion of all this crap, do I? You <br/>\nknow how I felt, hearing it, but I bit my tongue, so that my friend felt she <br/>\ncould confide in me.) Anyway, three weeks into the school year, the boy was <br/>\non Ritalin or Adderol or whatever. The mom said he was doing much better in <br/>\nclass, but, playing at our house, he was not the same child. Quiet, biddable <br/>\n-- !! Oh, yes, I can see why it would be easier for a teacher to have a class <br/>\nfull of kids like this. Anyway, my point was -- this mom truly loves her <br/>\nchild. She did what she thought was best. In my opinion, she didn&#39;t &quot;do the <br/>\nwork&quot;. The questioning, the exhausting part. When the same first grade <br/>\nteacher her little boy has, had my older son in class and mentioned ADD, I <br/>\nwent to the library, I called friends and family, my pediatrician (who, to <br/>\nhis credit, sent me some Xeroxed literature on ADD), searched the Internet -- <br/>\nuntil I could put together the knowledge that I had gained with the feelings <br/>\nin my heart. Mainly, why would ANYONE drug their child to fit a learning <br/>\nsituation, rather than change the learning situation to fit their child?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis -- the gathering knowledge part -- SHOULD be exhausting. It&#39;s a <br/>\nsatisfying exhaustion, though. :) <br/>\n <br/>\n I asked once, over at the message boards, how some of the wiser mommas came <br/>\nto unschooling. What was their path? Or were they, like Athena from the head <br/>\nof Zeus, birthed from John Holt fully unschooled themselves. See, the <br/>\nprocess, the path it took to get there, was of more help and interest to me <br/>\nthan talking about the end-destination -- how great everything was in <br/>\nUnschooling Land. Not &quot;How to Do It&quot;, but &quot;What Caused You To Seek This <br/>\nPath?&quot; Never Stop Questioning. (Hangs in our dining room next to Question <br/>\nAuthority. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32893,"nextTopicId":32911}}
