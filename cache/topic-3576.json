I am not attempting to reopen a bucket of worms like<br/>\nthis but wanted to pass on a couple of things for you to consider.  First, let<br/>\nme say I am a Christian was raised by very authoritarian parents and started<br/>\nout parenting similarly.  I have changed.  My dh comes right after God just as<br/>\nyou outlined but my kids are much more to me than I was taught children should<br/>\nbe considered.  I can testify that being raised in an authoritarian<br/>\nmethodology<br/>\ndoes in fact breed and cultivate unthinking obedience. It took me the better<br/>\npart of 20 years to overcome the effects of an authoritarian upbringing,<br/>\nand in<br/>\nfact probably still suffer from it at times.  So I know that comment to be<br/>\ntrue<br/>\nin the fullest form.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thoroughly support this quote and would say it is now how I look at my<br/>\nchildren:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I have noticed that there are not a lot of verses <br/>\nabout childraising in the bible and I believe that is because we should treat <br/>\nour children like anyone else; with love, patience, respect, etc... Notice <br/>\nthat even God let&#39;s us have free will and we blow it often! So it should go <br/>\nwith our children. And that is my two cents. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to your sharing of scripture I only want to ask you to pull your<br/>\nBible back out and revisit a verse, Gen 1:28 where God told them to multiply<br/>\n(i.e., children) and replenish the earth.  It wasn&#39;t until verse 31 that God<br/>\nsaid it was very good.  A man can live alone with no wife and live a life God<br/>\nviews as very good in our day and time (I Corn. 7:8) and living married is<br/>\nalso<br/>\nlooked upon by God as very good in our day and time (I Corn. 7:2 and others.) <br/>\nWith or without children a marriage is a good thing and as you say lacks<br/>\nnothing.  Interestingly, in scripture, the number 3 represents completeness<br/>\n- a<br/>\nchild actually makes a family; there is no family without children, only a<br/>\ncouple.  So while God had not created children by verse 31 He did in fact<br/>\ncreate the necessary means by which a child could be born.�And even instructed<br/>\nAdam and Eve to multiply.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A healthy husband/wife relationship is necessary to the emotional wellbeing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of a child.� &gt;When they see that mom & dad love each other more than anything,<br/>\ntheir world is secure.� &gt;They don&#39;t worry or even think that they aren&#39;t<br/>\nloved,<br/>\nthey know they are.� They don&#39;t need to &gt;be made the center of the family to<br/>\nfeel love. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is so true.  They aren&#39;t to be the center of the family; but God should<br/>\nbe.  And with God in His proper place, the family can function with<br/>\nemphasis on<br/>\nchildren or not on children.  That is really left up to the parents.  Children<br/>\nshould be treated with respect for their feelings on different subjects just<br/>\nlike adults.  An adult can usually tell if their feelings are truly in need of<br/>\nconsideration or if they are throwing a temper tantrum, fit of jealousy, etc. <br/>\nBut we must be able to hear their side of things and weigh the situation<br/>\nteaching them how to listen to their feelings but weigh them against what God<br/>\nwants in any given situation.  It is much easier to simply be authoritarian -<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have the judgement calls to make - it is just OBEY!  God does not do<br/>\nthat to us thus I do not believe God would want us to do that to our<br/>\nchildren. <br/>\nFreedom of will is BIG with God!  Christ obeyed God of his own free will unto<br/>\nthe death of the cross.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In GKGW they suggest daily &quot;couch time&quot;.� It&#39;s a time taken 10-15<br/>\n&gt; min.everyday, in front of the kids (meaning you don&#39;t go into a back room<br/>\n&gt; somewhere or wait til they go to bed) and you two talk with the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>understanding<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the kids are not to interrupt.� It provides your kids with a visual sense of<br/>\n&gt; your togetherness.� They also suggest each parent set up a certain time each<br/>\n&gt; week to spend one-on-one time with each child, and family things to do<br/>\n&gt; together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This amazes me.  Don&#39;t most parents spend time together in front of their<br/>\nchildren?  Don&#39;t the children see the parents just living life?  I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine telling my dds to sit there and watch Mom and Dad be together - oh and<br/>\nby the way, don&#39;t interrupt.  Yikes!  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll stop now, sorry so long.� Like I said this is how I believe. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; condemn anyone who lives or believes differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nor do I condemn you Faith.  It is wonderful to be able to speak what you<br/>\nbelieve in this country isn&#39;t it?  My heart goes out to all children in<br/>\nauthoritarian homes though, I&#39;ve been at the receiving end and the recovery<br/>\nend<br/>\nand it has become my decision to live with my children fostering free will,<br/>\nindividual thinking, questioning and openness.  These make my life very<br/>\nchallenging at times but it is well worth it to me to know my kids won&#39;t have<br/>\nto overcome the mental anguish authoritarianism creates.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand that my kids understand that there is appropriate authority in life<br/>\nbut they also know they can ask questions when they don&#39;t understand<br/>\n(something<br/>\nI was never allowed to do), they can choose to disagree with me (something<br/>\nthat<br/>\nI was never allowed to do), and they get to live with the consequences of<br/>\ntheir<br/>\nactions (something I never got to do until I was free of someone else doing my<br/>\nthinking for me - somewhere around age 21.)  By the way my earthly father<br/>\nstill<br/>\ncannot accept the fact that I don&#39;t opt to do things his way.  Thus, even now,<br/>\nto him my life is unacceptable.  I even feel sorry for him and the loss he<br/>\nsuffers from his current attitude toward me and my family.  My brother raises<br/>\nhis kids like my Dad did me.  My step mother once told me she thought my kids<br/>\nwere much more peaceful and less angry than my brother&#39;s kids.  Their only<br/>\noption to the frustration they feel is to lash out (for which they get<br/>\npunished.)  My kids can ask questions (respectfully) and even disagree with<br/>\nme.  For their safety of course, Mom and Dad has the last say in anything that<br/>\nmight harm them.  If it is something that will not physically harm them, we<br/>\nwill often let them spread their wings - I&#39;d rather be there to pick up the<br/>\npieces now and help them see how to avoid these things in the future while<br/>\nthey<br/>\nare still under my wing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing my best as well,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn His Service,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaraine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a> <br/>\nSubscribe to Our Prairie Primer Today Community at:<br/>\n             <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/PrairiePrimerToday</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"faith buckley","from":"faith buckley &lt;faithb@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vrfqu_sl9I00LWXtEZzwmLOLnE1Oa9MSDWQfGGQneuAwoJiuyxLSBospZSyRuumuceA9nWzA_qT3EXJeMZI2EJ7gAfff2Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: child centered parenting...","postDate":"939147439","msgId":3590,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNDIuMzU5MC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3576,"nextInTopic":3708,"prevInTime":3589,"nextInTime":3591,"topicId":3576,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A lot of this, if not all, will mean nothing to the non-Christian.

It&#39;s based<br/>\non scripture and God.  To those of you who are going to read this, please<br/>\ndon&#39;t take offense and think I am saying you have to follow this.  Erin asked<br/>\nme a question of what I have learned and the reasons to the way I believe.  I<br/>\nam simply answering her question.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod intended our priorities to be:<br/>\n1. God<br/>\n2. husband/wife<br/>\n3. children<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we get away from that and put children before our husband/wife<br/>\nrelationship and sometimes even before God we are getting into child-centered<br/>\nparenting.  Putting the child&#39;s feelings before anything, including their<br/>\nbehavior.  Always making the child &#39;feel&#39; happy instead of making him<br/>\nresponsible for his actions.  When the child leads what the family does<br/>\ninstead of mom and dad.  Basically making the child the center of our<br/>\nexistence.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong.  I love my children and they mean<br/>\neverything to me and my husband, but we know that our relationship with God<br/>\nand each other is more important.  Let me explain why before you label me an<br/>\nuncaring monster!<br/>\n<br/>\nGod made Adam, saw he was lonely and created Eve. Then he said &quot;it was very<br/>\ngood&quot; (Gen. 1:27-31) and rested.  If you notice children were not present when<br/>\nhe said this. After woman was created God authoritatively declared that His<br/>\ncreation was very good.  If children were necessary to complete man and woman<br/>\nGod would have created children, then said it was good.  The marriage<br/>\nrelationship lacks nothing.  Woman alone completes man and visa vera.  So, the<br/>\nhusband and wife form the nucleus of the family unit.  Children do not<br/>\ncomplete the family: they expand it.  A healthy husband/wife relationship is<br/>\nnecessary to the emotional wellbeing of a child.  When they see that mom & dad<br/>\nlove each other more than anything, their world is secure.  They don&#39;t worry<br/>\nor even think that they aren&#39;t loved, they know they are.  They don&#39;t need to<br/>\nbe made the center of the family to feel love.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn GKGW they suggest daily &quot;couch time&quot;.  It&#39;s a time taken 10-15<br/>\nmin.everyday, in front of the kids (meaning you don&#39;t go into a back room<br/>\nsomewhere or wait til they go to bed) and you two talk with the understanding<br/>\nthe kids are not to interrupt.  It provides your kids with a visual sense of<br/>\nyour togetherness.  They also suggest each parent set up a certain time each<br/>\nweek to spend one-on-one time with each child, and family things to do<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll stop now, sorry so long.
