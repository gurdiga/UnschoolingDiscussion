The parenting methodology<br/>\nwe had read would say things like if your child forget something as you were<br/>\nleaving, not to turn around and go back so they could get it so they will<br/>\nremember next time. Or, if they left laundry in the washer, bag it up so<br/>\nthey won&#39;t do it again. A &quot;natural consequence&quot;.  I just couldn&#39;t do it,<br/>\nbecause when I forgot something, I was willing to turn around and go get<br/>\nwhatever it was (and my memory what it is, it happens a lot!) and I don&#39;t<br/>\nalways get to my laundry and I love it when someone switches a load into the<br/>\ndryer for me. I just couldn&#39;t justify treating my children in a way that<br/>\nseemed so disrespectful and was such a double standard from the way I wanted<br/>\nto be treated.  What has happened is my children and more than happy to<br/>\naccommodate me forgetting things and they will gladly switch whoever&#39;s<br/>\nlaundry needs to be switched.  Instead of creating dependent, irresponsible<br/>\nchildren that the books warned would happen, I have children that are<br/>\nthoughtful, considerate and understanding. And oddly enough, they forget<br/>\nthings a lot less than I do.  Anyway, the above comment just reminded me of<br/>\nthis, because I had more than one person tell me I was doing my kids a<br/>\ndisservice. Humph.

I know the feelings you speak of - I&#39;ve got a DS who is <br/>\nquite a climber (climbing furniture at 6 months! and we&#39;re talking <br/>\nclimbed onto the couch, over the arm onto a straightback chair and <br/>\nwas trying to get onto a 6 ft tall bookcase!) I&#39;ve learned two <br/>\nthings over time: 1 - he has a way better sense of balance and <br/>\nposition than I do (his body-sense I guess you might call it - he <br/>\n*knows* where he is, what he wants to do, and whether he can and how <br/>\nto do it) 2 - injuries happen sometimes from the most innocuous <br/>\nthings. DS has had two broken bones and he&#39;s 7 1/2. The first was <br/>\nrunning indoors - indoor/outdoor carpeting over concrete slab. <br/>\nLanded oddly when he tripped (he was 18 months old at the time) and <br/>\nmade a nice clean break in his right radius near the wrist. Who&#39;d&#39;a <br/>\nthunk it? - he&#39;d done the same thing a gazillion times during his <br/>\ntoddlerhood. Then, right at about 4 yrs old, he and some other kids <br/>\nwere playing in and around a big box (the big old Gateway computer <br/>\nboxes). They were climbing in and out for quite a while. DS had gone <br/>\nin and out several times already. Then one time the box took a tip <br/>\nand dumped DS out and he broke his left humerus just above the <br/>\nelbow. He had been in and out bunches of times and even taken <br/>\nspills. Just that one time the landing was a bit off. <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of thoughts - practice falls. Roll off the couch and stuff <br/>\nand make it play to fall safely. Also, maybe look for a balance <br/>\nboard type thing, kid size - something that she can use to develop <br/>\nbalance (which she seems to be enjoying) that is designed for the <br/>\nprocess rather than her rocker (after all, it is that gift-giving <br/>\ntime of the year).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46250780,"authorName":"denise perri","from":"denise perri &lt;de_perri@...&gt;","profile":"de_perri","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: natural consequences","postDate":"1133317171","msgId":110337,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTMwMDIxOTMxLjIzNjkyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjM0MTEzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMzMyOTkzOTEuMzMxMS40MDA3MC5tMjhAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":110342,"prevInTime":110336,"nextInTime":110338,"topicId":110337,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If the mom cares about the child being warm, the mom should take a coat and a blanket and a hat, and not make a big deal about it.
