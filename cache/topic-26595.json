You use two randomly selected cards for each game, and they<br/>\neach have 6 or 7 different equations of jewels, like two red jewels (and<br/>\nthey show pictures of two red jewels for this) = a blue, a white, and a<br/>\nyellow jewel.  That&#39;s the exchange system part. Then there are also<br/>\nsmaller cards that you &quot;buy&quot;, each of which has a combination of 5 jewels<br/>\non it, like two blues and 3 greens. On your turn, you can either roll the<br/>\ndie, which has all five jewel colors on it and a star (wild), or you can<br/>\nmake one exchange, based on the equations, Exchanges can be made forwards<br/>\nor backwards, you can trade, say, a green and get 3 blues, or trade 3<br/>\nblues and get a green. At the end of your turn, if you want, you can buy<br/>\na small card if you have the right jewels, and after you buy, you get<br/>\npoints according to how many jewels you have left in your hand - the<br/>\nfewer you have left, the more points. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And do you live somewhere near Stanford?

Then we moved all of our stuff to a<br/>\nfarmhouse on our friends&#39; farm, about 100 miles north of Alameda, and<br/>\nmoved ourselves to Tucson, to stay in my parents&#39; guest house while my<br/>\nmother lives with cancer for as long as she can.

I think I&#39;ll like this list community. I don&#39;t know if I like the term unschooler because it feels a little negative but I&#39;m not what I&#39;d call a homeschooler either unless I&#39;m dealing with the school board. They sure wouldn&#39;t go for the term unschooler. I&#39;m an alternative or community educator/student maybe. Two things for sure, I don&#39;t make my kids go to school and I don&#39;t follow a curriculum, which seems to be just the ticket on this list. A third thing about me, that may be significant here, is that I believe I have more to learn from my kids than I have to teach them.<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your child can and will learn math when it has some meaning in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My friend struggled all through public school with math.  She could not<br/>\n  memorize the &quot;times tables&quot;.  She could not add or subtract in her head. <br/>\n  She never got fractions or percentages.  And in high school she had to<br/>\n  take algebra twice and still never understood it.   <br/>\n  Today she is a loan officer.  In real life there are calculators and<br/>\n  adding machines and computers and people to ask.  Teachers are the only<br/>\n  ones who get uptight about answering questions, I think.  There is such a<br/>\n  thing as learning on the job.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Her inability to do math in school has never effected her life as an<br/>\n  adult. As an adult she learned exactly what she needed.   It did effect<br/>\n  her life at school however.  She felt stupid and humiliated and suffered<br/>\n  from terrible headaches.  <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know anyone who doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s better to be confident and<br/>\n  happy and healthy.   <br/>\n  Deb L<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
