This is their caption -<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Discover the cosmos! Each<br/>\n&gt; day a different image or photograph of our<br/>\n&gt; fascinating universe is<br/>\n&gt; featured, along with a brief explanation written by<br/>\n&gt; a professional<br/>\n&gt; astronomer.&quot; I go here everyday and look at a<br/>\n&gt; fascinating pic and read<br/>\n&gt; the explanation. Plus, the explanations are usually<br/>\n&gt; full of links, so I<br/>\n&gt; spend awhile clicking and learning. Tho I have to<br/>\n&gt; admit, some days and<br/>\n&gt; some links are a bit over my head. Not all! But<br/>\n&gt; some.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is absolutely great. Go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.seds.org/\">http://www.seds.org/</a><br/>\n&gt; which is Students<br/>\n&gt; for the Exploration and Development of Space. I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t even checked it<br/>\n&gt; all out yet. I spend all my time at their The Nine<br/>\n&gt; Planets Solar System<br/>\n&gt; Tour<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html.\">http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html.</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; spent the first day following all the moon links.<br/>\n&gt; And another day<br/>\n&gt; following all the sun links. Those are my two<br/>\n&gt; favorites that I keep<br/>\n&gt; going back to. I haven&#39;t completed the tour yet, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; taking my time :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And finally Thursday&#39;s Classroom<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thursdaysclassroom.com/.\">http://thursdaysclassroom.com/.</a> This is<br/>\n&gt; a NASA website for teachers and students with ideas<br/>\n&gt; for study and<br/>\n&gt; classroom (but fine for us too). I ended up<br/>\n&gt; following their links to<br/>\n&gt; read about the South Pole and diary entries of some<br/>\n&gt; college students who<br/>\n&gt; went there (they are trying to figure out if it will<br/>\n&gt; be a good location<br/>\n&gt; for astronomy). It changes on a regular basis, tho,<br/>\n&gt; so the topic will<br/>\n&gt; not always be the same. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shannon, unschooling, amateur, arm chair astronomer<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
