He says <br/>\nhe works in the Xray department and only 10% have actual heart issues the <br/>\nother 90 % are fakers. Though he has a many medical issues himself (he&#39;s maybe <br/>\n50). Hmmm...

I think my mom was just resentful and angry. She has always told me about the opportunities she&#39;s missed in life. She was (and is) very much the classic martyr where the house would be clean if not for us, things would run smoothly if not for us and when things work it&#39;s only because she&#39;s managed to pull it together. At the same time of course she was wonderful and layed the foundations for unschooling in me (she just told me she was a fan of John Holts from waaay back). She recognizes much of what she did in the past that was wrong but does little to change it now. I think too she doesn&#39;t really trust us to make decisions, as she&#39;s always told us what to do. I was doing laundry at her house the other day, cleaned the lint trap and left the lint on a shelf. There&#39;s no garbage in that room so I&#39;d planned to take it up when I was done all my laundry. 20 mins later she was ranting about the lint and how no one ever puts it in the garbage. I don&#39;t think it would occur to her to take a moment and trust that I would clean it up when I was done. <br/>\n      So my battles have been to take that moment when somethings not done and trust that it will be. Also, to make housework a joy in this house (It&#39;s been shocking to realize I enjoy much of it) and not a burden to resent. I had to realize that when I create burdens for myself its the family that has to bear the weight of it. <br/>\n      So no drugs or drinking but...I think my mother&#39;s addiction was her rage. And I think I caught it, I&#39;m by no means over it but I&#39;m much, much better than I was even a year ago.

Thank God.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder, in this thread about tantruming, either ourselves or our <br/>\nparents...is alcoholism or drug use part of these lives? My dad was <br/>\nthe &quot;town drunk&quot; as I was growing up and I know my mom&#39;s stress had <br/>\nits roots in that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/23/03 11:26:52 PM, sheran@p... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; trying not to differentiate between my moments and their moments so <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; much, so I keep reminding myself that when I&#39;m doing something with <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; them, it is something that I&#39;m doing for them AND for me.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sheila, I really like that point.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I remember nudging myself to think that way too, just a few years <br/>\nago (after <br/>\n&gt; we moved, so within the past six years).

I throw tantrums too. I know the lingo of positive discipline and respect for kids and manage to practice it much of the time but my mom planted that martyr seed deep (And I nurtured it, can&#39;t blame her completely). The one that tells me I never have a free moment, my husband never helps, the kids don&#39;t respect me. That the world revolves around me and is out to get me. Ugh.<br/>\n    I raged at my daughter last night and you know what the worst thing is, the thing that made me really work at correcting this? I didn&#39;t feel bad about it. Honestly it feels good to lash out at the kids. I hear other moms talk about how bad they feel right after they&#39;ve spanked their kids and I don&#39;t relate. It&#39;s in moments of reflection, like on this list that I hate what I&#39;ve down. Actually, I guess I do feel guilt, it&#39;s just slow to come. I could see myself becoming an abuser (or staying one, I was not as bad with my rage as some parents I knew but I don&#39;t think it takes much to mark a child) though and so I turned to attachment parenting (thank God for breastfeeding, I credit a lot of my good parenting to that experience), positive discipline and now unschooling. <br/>\n    Anyhow...not sure why I made this long confession. I think in part because I&#39;d been talking about non-spanking and such and feeling a bit like a fraud because it&#39;s been such a struggle to stop. And all you cool, nifty parents who seem to have your acts together (I know it just seems that way ;) ) and here I am trying to tread water at times. But thanks, because I&#39;m learning alot here.<br/>\n   I love this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (Rambling Nonsensical Confessions-R-Us Inc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Parents tantruming","postDate":"1069602091","msgId":85201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1M2QwMWMzYjFkOCQ0NGFlNDVmMCQwNTAwMDAwYUBtYWJiLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwOS4yOWFkZjdjNC4yY2YyMjZlNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":85226,"prevInTime":85200,"nextInTime":85202,"topicId":85201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
