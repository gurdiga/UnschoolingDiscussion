Just out of control behavior.<br/>\n===============<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Sam (4) has a very similar reaction to HFCS, CS, dextrose--pretty much any form. While we were doing the elimination diet trying to figure all this out, we talked a lot about allergies and paying attention to our body and the signals it sends us. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt home, I&#39;ve pretty much just eliminated all foods that contain CS. For the past several months, we&#39;ve been sampling and finding substitute foods that taste good and satisfy. We&#39;ve found really good brands of most everything we eat: cheddar crackers, crackers, graham crackers, popscicles, sorbet, yogurt, ice cream cones, etc. I just buy Breyer&#39;s Ice Cream instead of other brands, ghirardelli chocolate, organic vanilla extract (yup, it&#39;s in that too!), that kind of thing. We make lots of chocolate chip cookies, chocolate chip pancakes. For us, it&#39;s a matter of having all the same kid kind of things in the house that don&#39;t have CS. Sam never misses anything while he&#39;s at home and has free choice of foods in much the same way that other unschooled kids do--his choices just don&#39;t have CS in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hard part is when we&#39;re out because absolutely everything has CS in it. Pretty much we just deal with it. If we&#39;re going someplace where I can bring food, we do--like the park or someplace where everyone&#39;s picnicing. When we visit my in-laws, I&#39;ll bring stuff with us, which at least cuts down some on the amount of CS he ingests. But, when we&#39;re on vacation and eating out a lot, there&#39;s very little we can do.
