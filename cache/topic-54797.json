That they<br/>\nwould have a deep seeded knowledge in their hearts that they are intelligent, <br/>\ncapable human beings and can learn anything they wish.  A sense of wonder so <br/>\nawesome <br/>\nthat they will never quit seeing how magical the world truly is.  Have <br/>\nidealism <br/>\ntempered with realism.  Spirituality that flows natrually and freely from a <br/>\nloving heart and <br/>\nposses kindness rare.  The ability to follow their dreams and achieve their <br/>\ngoals, <br/>\nwhatever those may be. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how do you plan to help that along? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt humbles me to think about this.  I came out of High School battered <br/>\nemotionally, not knowing who I was or what I realy wanted.  And fifteen years <br/>\nlater, here I am <br/>\nspouting off ideals for my children that I couldn&#39;t have dreamed of at the <br/>\ntime. <br/>\nI will help that along by becoming a better person myself. <br/>\nBy reading , watching , searching and regaining that sense of wonder, which <br/>\nmy children have helped me with already. <br/>\nBy delving deep into questions and not pretending I know more than them. <br/>\nBy being willing to set everything aside, change plans midstream and go off <br/>\nin a new direction when necessary. <br/>\nBy listening carefully and responding appropriately. <br/>\nBy respecting these amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the inner <br/>\nknowledge they already possess. <br/>\nBy dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love to the <br/>\nearth and my fellow human beings. <br/>\nBy filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, toys, art <br/>\nmaterials and whatever oddities my children bring home. <br/>\nBy taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never knew <br/>\nexisted. <br/>\nBy fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries and making trips <br/>\nto the grocery store an adventure. <br/>\nBy making every day an adventure, by my attitude, every mundane chore or <br/>\ndaily activity sacred by how I approach it. <br/>\nHealing myself has definitely been the most important step in assisting these <br/>\nworthy individuals in their unschooling journey.  I have learned much from <br/>\nthem <br/>\nthank the heavens they came here to teach me. <br/>\nRen 5/02 <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.
