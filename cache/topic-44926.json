We were <br/>\nleaving our favorite little italian eating place (in Okinawa :) and <br/>\na truck pulled up with a Komondor.  If you&#39;ve ever seen one they are <br/>\nthe coolist!  The look like a mop!  My kids were enthralled and the <br/>\nowner let us pet him.  He was white with dreadlocks at least a foot <br/>\nlong.  He was so sweet.  We asked all sorts of questions about how <br/>\nhe handles the heat here and the only problem reported was due to <br/>\nthe humidity he can have mildew growth!  EWWW!  We came home and <br/>\nimmediately went to the akc site and looked the Komondor up as well <br/>\nas many other breeds and read about their best attributes.  The <br/>\nfunniest thing was trying to get two very silly tired kids to say <br/>\nShih Tzu!  I was rolling!  I guess this could be classified under <br/>\nbiology?  We had fun.<br/>\nMichelle B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44918,"nextTopicId":44884}}
