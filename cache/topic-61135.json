I just re-read part of it and you need to remember that they can&#39;t come in or talk to your kids without a warrant. I think that part would apply in any state and with truant officers too, but didn&#39;t have time to read that deeply. <br/>\nAlso, to the person from Northern CA with 2 yo who is thinking of unschooling- go to the hsc website (above), and learn about their Conference in August. It is a wonderful way to connect with others even if noone around you is unschooling. There are a lot of unschoolers there. <br/>\nMary T, mostly lurking<br/>\nPS Ren I wish the best for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54211,"nextTopicId":61197}}
