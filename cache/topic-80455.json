He was in speech at school, but I&#39;ve noticed after the summer <br/>\nand now that he&#39;s home full time, he&#39;s beginning to speak a little more <br/>\nclearly.  His is/was pretty severe, but the caseworker said both his parents spoke <br/>\nexactly the same way, as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of the &quot;lazy lion licked a lolly pop&quot; Dr. Seuss book to <br/>\npractice.
