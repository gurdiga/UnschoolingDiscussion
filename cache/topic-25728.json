I&#39;ve been <br/>\nto three different Methodist churches, all of that denomination. (Sang in an <br/>\nEaster cantata...) The only differences I noted between them and the Southern <br/>\nBaptists (without doing a lot of research--just looking through what was at <br/>\nhand and from observation) was they have more of the traditional &quot;church <br/>\ncalendar&quot; (advent, Holy Week stuff that the Baptist didn&#39;t keep), and their <br/>\nsermons are less fiery and brimstoney.  They had the option of infant baptism <br/>\nor of those who requested it after the age of reason (meaning kids who <br/>\nfigured out that they wanted to accept Baptism to mark their understanding of <br/>\nChristianity, or adults who had.  That, I think, is their &quot;born again&quot; <br/>\nmoment--wanting to acknowledge one&#39;s relationship with Christ in public, to <br/>\nbe baptized and join a church.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was always taught (by Southern Baptists) that baptism was symbolic of the <br/>\ndeath, burial and ressurection of the old self, and coming up out of the <br/>\nwater was a symbolic moment of the new birth of a Christian.  But that was <br/>\nsymbol.  The REAL new birth was that moment of realization and desire to live <br/>\nfor Jesus and to accept that without Jesus&#39; sacrifice, eternal life would not <br/>\nhave been an option, and that only those who accept a personal relationship <br/>\nwith Jesus and God can be saved.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for G.Bush Jr., living in Texas, it&#39;s pretty important that he identify <br/>\nhimself as &quot;born again.&quot;  For many Christians ONLY &quot;born again&quot; Christians <br/>\nare &quot;real Christians.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25740,"nextTopicId":25718}}
