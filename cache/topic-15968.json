They <br/>\nhavent <br/>\nreally ever expressed any interest in guns though. Thank goodness!**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a parent for almost 23 years now. For over two decades of parenting <br/>\ntime I said and believed that I would NEVER allow a toy gun in my home, for <br/>\nall of the usual philosophical reasons. Mostly though I was lucky to have <br/>\nchildren who did not show persistent interest in toy weaponry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, as of May of last year there is now resident in my home a bright red <br/>\ncap gun pistol.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest son convinced me to allow him to spend some of his eighth <br/>\nbirthday gift money on the gun. At least part of that decision was based on <br/>\nthe fact that he has been more persistent than any of my other children in <br/>\nhis desire for guns and gun play. He is known as the boy who can make a gun <br/>\nout of anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most interesting side effect of the purchase has been that his gun play <br/>\ndecreased dramatically after the first month, to a point where I have noted <br/>\nthat weeks go by now without guns being made out of KNex and the cap gun has <br/>\nneeded to be dusted off before use. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis desire for a pocket knife was our newest challenge. :) Unfortunately, in <br/>\nthe last few decades pocket knives have changed from being a normal <br/>\npossession of most middle childhood boys. We live in a moderately populated <br/>\narea with a violent gang problem. We have to be careful where we allow our <br/>\nson to carry his knife, especially as he approaches puberty and begins to be <br/>\nmore suspect just for being male and young. :( <br/>\n<br/>\nHis knife is not a toy though, it&#39;s a tool that he&#39;s putting a lot of time <br/>\ninto mastering.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15413,"nextTopicId":16356}}
