I was <br/>\nwondering if there are any unschoolers there.  My boy will turn 13 in <br/>\na few days and we are looking for kids perhaps between the ages of 12 <br/>\nand 16. He interested in (to name a few) skate boarding, bike riding, <br/>\nstreet luging, computers and wants to learn computer animation and <br/>\nprograming, legos, building forts, working with wood, Playstation 2<br/>\n  Also are there any unschooling groups in the area who meet together <br/>\non a regular basis? <br/>\n  He is part of Laurel Springs school, a long distance homeschooling <br/>\numbrella school, which is located in Ojai. His teacher is in Ventura <br/>\nand is totally supporting and encouraging his self-directed learning <br/>\nstyle.  We live up in the foothills of the Seirra Nevada Mountains <br/>\nnow and there are no other homeschoolers up here and not alot to do <br/>\nsocially.  My boy (and myself) really need some other association of <br/>\nthose who have the same learning philosophy.<br/>\n  Hoping to hear from someone soon.<br/>\nGovinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53240,"nextTopicId":53206}}
