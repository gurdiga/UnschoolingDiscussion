The spider fell down the front of his shirt and got trapped in the area between his belt and stomach.  The area swelled up and and turned very dark, but did not slough off.  I put lots of drawing salve on it, like baking soda with lemon juice, and without getting too gross, I used a rattlesnake extraction kit.  The big baby wouldn&#39;t go to the doctor!  But luckily, he turned out OK!  No wonder he&#39;s afraid of spiders!<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19981,"nextTopicId":19998}}
