Unschoolers. &lt;G&gt;  Liam McClure, whose mom was one of  my first LLL <br/>\nleaders when Kirby was a baby, is in one of his classes.

They <br/>\nand two others of their crowd (these others are  19-21, to Kirby&#39;s 18) are <br/>\nplanning to take at least one class together next  semester.  Of those five, four <br/>\nare unschooled (Brett from 3rd grade, Renee  went to school part of one year, <br/>\n7th grade or so, out of curiosity) and the  fifth was schooled at home by a <br/>\nvery forgetful and disorganized mom.<br/>\n <br/>\nAmong the gamers and anime club, Kirby&#39;s had lots of older friends.   Maybe <br/>\nwhen he was little they just thought he was cute, or he was available more  <br/>\neasily than kids in school, or maybe he just actually TALKED to them like they  <br/>\nwere human instead of ducking and dodging because they were adults and he  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t.
