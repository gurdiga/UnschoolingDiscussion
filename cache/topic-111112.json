She was asked earlier tonight..&quot;so you have never been to any high school?&quot;  She said...&quot;I went to first grade.&quot;  She didn&#39;t elaborate about that but did start talking about some other things.  The guy asking is selling us his house and is probably 27 or so...went to an IB program for high school, B.S. from a major university, then a pilot in the military in Afganistan and now is starting to work on his Masters in Electrical Engineering.  I could tell he didn&#39;t  know what to think of this very articulate young women who only went to first grade and was quite comfortable holding her own in a conversation with him.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe asked what we do and I told him the condensed version....read, play games, go the library, go to museums and to the beach.  He didn&#39;t quite know what to make of us.  <br/>\n <br/>\n The more involved version would have been...We&#39;ve moved across the country twice in the past 2 months so top on our list would be travel! :-)  In addition to those 4000 miles, she also went to St. Louis for Live and Learn and to West Virginia for Not Back to School Camp.  She has both schooled and unschooled friends that she keeps in touch with through hanging out at the house, e-mails and late night IM&#39;s.  She  plays guitar and piano, sings and takes voice lessons, reads, does art projects, writes and even wrote a short novel a couple of months ago that she published, <br/>\nwatches &quot;House&quot; with me on TV, loves to photograph people,  bakes a perfect pie, makes bread, roasts chili, is almost ready to take her driver&#39;s test to get her license, makes lists and does everything on her list every day, laughs so hard telling a funny story that she falls on the floor.  Does any of that &quot;count&quot; for high school?  Probably not but our lives don&#39;t need anything to count for high school.<br/>\n <br/>\nCollege is part of her future plans as well as more travel.  She is considering some community college courses this next year....and kickboxing and  learning how to develop her own pictures ......and going to Vermont for NBTSC and to Kentucky to visit friends.  Her life is busy and happy.  She isn&#39;t a high schooler...she is just Brenna living her life knowing that she can do anything she wants to do not only today but with her future.   <br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: dmcml5 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dmcml5@...\">dmcml5@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wed, 11 Jan 2006 06:01:41 -0000<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] unschooling a high schooler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello-<br/>\nJust wondering how many are unschooling a high schooler?
