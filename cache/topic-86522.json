I hate to mend and hem.  It is a wish of mine to have a<br/>\nphotograph of my children in matching pajamas in front of our Christmas tree<br/>\nand/or their stockings every Christmas (photo to be taken on Christmas Eve).<br/>\nI have two girls (ages 7 & 3).  I found matching red plaid sleepwear (night<br/>\ngown for my daughter that likes nightgowns, pajamas with pants for my<br/>\ndaughter that only likes pants).  Well, the pants are way too long.  The<br/>\nsmallest size that I could find were a size too big.  I didn&#39;t realize that<br/>\nthey&#39;d be quite this big.  So, I either have to hem them, or go without the<br/>\nphoto because my daughter will not wear clothes that are too big or too<br/>\nsmall (she&#39;ll just strip in order to be comfortable).  So...  today I am<br/>\nhemming.  I&#39;ve procrastinated it because I hate hemming, but I&#39;ll do it<br/>\nbecause I want that photo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:  My 7 yo daughter, Zoe, wanted to wrap her Christmas<br/>\npresent for her sister in white paper that she could decorate (her goal and<br/>\nidea, not mine).  We have white paper, but was having a really hard time<br/>\nfinding a time when her sister was asleep or otherwise not going to see.  A<br/>\ncouple of nights ago, she fell asleep and I immediately went and got Zoe and<br/>\nsaid, &quot;I know you are busy right now, but here is your chance.  Teagan is<br/>\nasleep.&quot;  I helped get the supplies out for wrapping and coloring and Zoe<br/>\ndid it.  I helped with the harder parts in order to make it go faster (we<br/>\nwere worried that Teagan would wake up and see what we were doing--she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t).  I reminded, she had to stop the really fun thing that she was in<br/>\nthe middle of, but she wanted to wrap so she did it then (even though it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the ideal time for her).  I wouldn&#39;t have been mad if she&#39;d said that<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t want to do it then, but I would have reminded her that she might<br/>\nnot get another chance (we&#39;d been waiting for a chance for weeks).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, of course, we do things that we don&#39;t really want to do in order to<br/>\nget our long term goals met.  I do the laundry and dishes practically every<br/>\nday so that my long term goal of not having to do 10 loads of laundry and/or<br/>\nmultiple loads of dishes in one day is met.  :)  It would be nice to do zero<br/>\nloads a day, but I would rather eat and wear clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ, a radical unschooler</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":137838629,"authorName":"Lillian Haas","from":"&quot;Lillian Haas&quot; &lt;lhaas@...&gt;","profile":"homleighacademy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Radical vs. Regular?","postDate":"1072132188","msgId":86572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzNzQwMWMzYzhkYiQxYmJlZmJjMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBMaXZpYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMxMjIyMjIyNTAxLjIzMjA2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86571,"nextInTopic":86573,"prevInTime":86571,"nextInTime":86573,"topicId":86522,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, yes, yes!

You&#39;re certainly <br/>\naware that you do things sometimes even though you&#39;d rather do other <br/>\nthings &quot;at the moment.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a procrastinator. It is partly because I always have been able to <br/>\ndo what you say your son will do - procrastinate and then successfully <br/>\n&quot;catch up&quot; in a last-minute intensive effort. It is the nature of how I <br/>\nwork. It is also sometimes because I do too many things and I do simply <br/>\n&quot;forget&quot; about some of them until they become &quot;fires&quot; that have to be <br/>\nput out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome occasional &quot;reminding&quot; is just kindness between people who care <br/>\nabout each other, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, parents who really want their kids to continue with their <br/>\nmusic practice or latin group or whatever - will often claim to just be <br/>\n&quot;reminding&quot; and say their kids have a choice, when, in fact, the kids <br/>\nfeel subtly pressured by the parents regular reminders to keep at <br/>\nsomething that the kid would otherwise have dropped.  This is common. <br/>\nYour situation may or may not be like this, but we can&#39;t tell from what <br/>\nyou write that it isn&#39;t. So, like anything else posted to this list, <br/>\nget ready for it to be critiqued and examined and looked at from a <br/>\nnumber of points of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, I very much understand procrastination issues &lt;G&gt;. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I&#39;d appreciate someone else constantly reminding me to do the <br/>\nthings they think I really want to do instead of what I am doing at the <br/>\nmoment, though. I&#39;m trying to think of how my parents could have helped <br/>\nme be less of a procrastinator....I see it in my kids and I still do <br/>\nit, myself, so it isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve resolved, entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do &quot;nagging&quot; - it drives me nuts (because as a procrastinator <br/>\nmyself I hate it when people start &quot;reminding&quot; me - &quot;Honey, didn&#39;t you <br/>\nwant to go grocery shopping? Maybe this would be a good time for you to <br/>\ndo that?&quot;) I don&#39;t do that to my family. But last night Rosie said, <br/>\n&quot;Oh, I need to remember to finish the blankets for Aunt Julie and Aunt <br/>\nKathleen. Remind me tomorrow morning, okay?&quot; So - right now since I <br/>\njust remembered &lt;G&gt;, I&#39;m calling out to her, &quot;Hey, Rosie, don&#39;t forget <br/>\nabout the blankets.&quot;  She says, &quot;Oh, yeah, thanks.&quot; And she&#39;s <br/>\ncontinuing to play her computer game. Maybe she&#39;ll remember the <br/>\nblankets today or tomorrow or maybe she&#39;ll be staying up late <br/>\nfrantically finishing them (Christmas gifts).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, Lillian, instead of examining whether or not you&#39;re still in the <br/>\nunschooling club if you remind your son to do something (because who <br/>\nthe heck cares - truth is, there is no club &lt;G&gt;), I&#39;m turning this into <br/>\na question of how do you handle it when you see your child <br/>\nprocrastinating doing something they want to do and you know it will <br/>\nend up that they&#39;ll have to do it under a time crunch and when tired, <br/>\netc. Or that it may not get done. Or that it&#39;ll get done but not in a <br/>\nway that the kid will be happy with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf some activity regularly requires parents to remind kids to do it I <br/>\nbet most unschoolers here will say: &quot;Let him procrastinate and learn <br/>\nfrom it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is harder for those of us who still feel kind of crummy <br/>\nabout ourselves because of our own tendency to procrastinate, even <br/>\nafter years and years of experiencing the natural consequences. We <br/>\nparents tend to be pretty reactive when see our own weaknesses or <br/>\nfailings showing up in our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do procrastinate like I do. It has helped me to watch them and <br/>\nrealize that they still manage to accomplish a LOT and that often the <br/>\nthings they procrastinate on are things they end up dropping later as <br/>\nlower priority than other things they&#39;re doing. My kids and I suffer <br/>\nfrom simply thinking we want to do a LOT more than what we can <br/>\nrealistically manage so procrastinating can sometimes be our way of <br/>\ndetermining which things we really do work on. Sometimes it is because <br/>\nwe&#39;re trying to do too much and are overwhelmed and kind of paralyzed. <br/>\nSometimes it is because we decide to do things because we think we <br/>\n&quot;should&quot; rather than because we really &quot;want&quot; to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - looking back at what Lillian wrote --<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;On days when I need to do something, I ask my husband and boys to <br/>\nremind me<br/>\nrepeatedly until I actually do it. It&#39;s quite easy to get distracted <br/>\nand let<br/>\nthings slip, even things that are important to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAsking others to remind you occasionally is one thing - saying you ask <br/>\nthem to remind you &quot;repeatedly&quot; seems like you&#39;re asking them to take <br/>\nresponsibility for you, instead of you finding a way to deal with your <br/>\nown distractibility.  I also can&#39;t help but question how important <br/>\nsomething can really be to you if you still &quot;let it slip&quot; after <br/>\nrepeated reminders.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There&#39;s nothing to reexamine about the Latin, and that was my point <br/>\nbefore: If he doesn&#39;t want<br/>\nto do it, he doesn&#39;t have to. But since he wants to do it, if he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to spend four hours on it in one day, he has to spread that out <br/>\nover<br/>\nseveral days. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that is his goal, a brief reminder, &quot;Honey, don&#39;t forget you wanted <br/>\nto do your Latin today and that you won&#39;t have time this afternoon <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re going to a movie,&quot; ought to be enough to give him the <br/>\nheads up that he might want to think about his time management for the <br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though my kids tend to be procrastinators like I am, my older kids <br/>\nwho take college courses manage to get all their work done and done <br/>\nwell. Sometimes they do it last minute and sometimes they plan ahead <br/>\nand do things early.  I don&#39;t remind them or even know what they have <br/>\nto do unless one of them says to me, &quot;Mom, remind me I need to work on <br/>\nmy project for my class tomorrow.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I didn&#39;t hear, Lillian, from your descriptions, was any mention of <br/>\nyour son initiating or asking for the reminders. So that leaves the <br/>\nfeeling this is mom wanting her kid to do things the &quot;right&quot; way - not <br/>\nleave it to the last minute.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;And if he gets so into Deus Ex or Freedom Force that he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>forgets, we have to remind him. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is that &quot;we have to&quot; phrase --- you mean you have to remind him <br/>\nor else he&#39;ll have to do it all at once at the last minute. But you <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; remind him. You could also help figure out all kinds of <br/>\nother ways to help him consider not putting it off. I use a computer <br/>\ncalendar that allows me to set &quot;alarms&quot; - either emails that I can set <br/>\nto arrive before an &quot;event&quot; or little popups that will remind me about <br/>\n&quot;events.&quot; And I put in as &quot;events&quot; anything that I think I might need <br/>\nto be reminded about. This works well for me because it is when I&#39;m <br/>\nonline that I&#39;m most likely to be procrastinating &lt;G&gt;. So if HE sees <br/>\nprocrastinating as a problem for himself, he might like to brainstorm <br/>\nwith you and come up with some ways he can be responsible for his own <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There are certain things in life that we all &quot;have&quot; to do, for <br/>\nwhatever reason.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis kind of statement is what gives your email a &quot;tone&quot; that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsound like unschooling. Yes, its true that we all have to do some <br/>\nthings - like eat and sleep and pay our taxes &lt;G&gt;. But what does that <br/>\nhave to do with a totally optional doing-it-because-he-loves-it Latin <br/>\nclass? He apparently DOES do it, right? Whether you remind him or not? <br/>\nThe question is whether he does it by spreading it out over several <br/>\ndays or does it all in one intense session at the last minute. He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do it either way. Neither is right or wrong. He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even &quot;have to&quot; do it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet that when he procrastinates and then does it all at once to get <br/>\nit done on time, he is unhappy and you worry that it won&#39;t continue to <br/>\nbe fun and he&#39;ll want to quit something that would continue to give him <br/>\npleasure if he&#39;d do it differently. Makes sense to me. So it would make <br/>\nsense to me to talk to him about that - give him that insight of yours <br/>\nso he has that awareness. I think maybe that is what you are trying to <br/>\ndo by repeatedly reminding him and that is why it still feels, to you, <br/>\nlike he has a choice, but from outside it looks like you care more <br/>\nabout him doing it than he does.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That makes it important to him, even if at a particular moment it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; not what<br/>\n&gt; he chooses to do.

He wants to do the Latin, but it&#39;s not foremost in<br/>\nhis mind most of the time. When a week goes by when I forget to remind him,<br/>\nhe stays up late on Monday night to get it done. It&#39;s not because I&#39;ve told<br/>\nhim it has to be done -- it&#39;s because he wants to keep up with the group.<br/>\nThat makes it important to him, even if at a particular moment it&#39;s not what<br/>\nhe chooses to do. It takes a lot more focused brainpower than playing<br/>\ncomputer games, so for the same reason I spend way too much time playing<br/>\nspider solitaire, he frequently plays games rather than doing anything else.<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s his choice, but it helps him when I remind him that there are<br/>\nother things in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nLillian</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144628419,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"&quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;tktraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Radical vs. Regular?","postDate":"1072116219","msgId":86544,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMzYzhiNSRlZGFiYTIzMCRhMjMzMTlhY0B5b3VyZ2c4N3Zxem96cT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFlMS4xNjE3MGZlNy4yZDE4Nzg1YkBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDE2MzAxYzNjOGFjJDA0NDA3ODkwJDY0MDFhOGMwQExpdmlhPg=="},"prevInTopic":86543,"nextInTopic":86547,"prevInTime":86543,"nextInTime":86545,"topicId":86522,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Its become the<br/>\nparent&#39;s agenda and not the child&#39;s.  There&#39;s such a fine line, and I have<br/>\ncrossed it before.  ( I&#39;m not saying its not important to him.) But, if he<br/>\nis into the Deus Ex or Freedom Force,  that might be a priority to him at<br/>\nthat time.   I<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is similar to practicing an instrument,  I&#39;ve seen it similar,<br/>\nanyway.   I have friends who keep reminding their kids about practicing.<br/>\nIt turns into a stressful thing.    I think the parents have to let it go.<br/>\nYes,  I might mention the instrument,  but its going to be up to them to get<br/>\nit done.   If they choose to do something else,  well,, that was more<br/>\nimportant to them then.  They know they won&#39;t have a certain piece down or<br/>\nwhat ever.   They might even go to a lesson unprepared,  its happened.   But<br/>\nits up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**On days when I need to do something, I ask my husband and boys to remind<br/>\nme<br/>\nrepeatedly until I actually do it. It&#39;s quite easy to get distracted and let<br/>\n things slip, even things that are important to me.**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would drive me crazy! &lt;g&gt;  When there are things to be done, I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant people reminding me to do it.  You and I are obviously different.  When<br/>\nI was growing up my mother would always be at me about things.  I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s why now if someone reminds me about something,  it really hits me<br/>\nwrong.  She would never allow me to take on the responsibility as my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this same vein,  I think my children will really be able to differentiate<br/>\nor prioritize what is important to them.  I already see them doing this.<br/>\nThey&#39;ve taken the responsiblity onto themselves.  They know what&#39;s true to<br/>\nthem and there won&#39;t be the kind-of distractions going on with them like<br/>\nthere is to me.   They don&#39;t have different thoughts going on in their heads<br/>\nlike: &quot;Oh, maybe I should be doing this instead of that&quot;.  They&#39;ll know.  I<br/>\nam just learning these things now. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn leading this unschooling life they are able to develop that sense.   When<br/>\nsomething is important, they do it,  if it isn&#39;t they don&#39;t,  and they don&#39;t<br/>\nsit and worry about what isn&#39;t happening--because it isn&#39;t important.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":137838629,"authorName":"Lillian Haas","from":"&quot;Lillian Haas&quot; &lt;lhaas@...&gt;","profile":"homleighacademy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Radical vs. Regular?","postDate":"1072115611","msgId":86543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZTAwMWMzYzhiNCQ4NTQzZDZmMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBMaXZpYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFmMS4xNWY3MTdhMC4yZDE4ODdmNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86542,"nextInTopic":86544,"prevInTime":86542,"nextInTime":86544,"topicId":86522,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... to ... not  doing a little at a time.

He says <br/>\nhe&#39;s an action transvestite, and an executive transvestite, not a &quot;weirdo <br/>\ntransvestite.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of discussions of homeschoolers, they&#39;re all homeschoolers.<br/>\nTo someone in South Africa, Americans are all Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo someone in Mexico or Canada, they probably know and care about the <br/>\ndifferences between Texans and Californians, or New Englanders/Midwesterners/Pacific <br/>\nNE folk.   Within a state, people know which regions are likely to be how, or <br/>\nwill expect what behavior or level of clothing formality, or will have what <br/>\nfood, and so forth.  In which town in your own state is there most likely to be <br/>\na mosque, or synagogue, or Buddhist center?  Which is likely to have three <br/>\nkinds of Pentecostal church?  Where can you buy Moon Pies and pork rinds?  Keifer <br/>\nand sprouts?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so within homeschooling some people have lots of shades of meaning for <br/>\nthe homeschoolers like themselves and fewer shades for those further away.   I <br/>\ndon&#39;t personally care much about the difference between ABeka and Sonlight, and <br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are differences!  Within those, I bet there are people who <br/>\nchoose their friends or avoid people based on how they use those, and I bet they <br/>\nthemselves have terminology for their slackers and too-stricts and just-rights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn different discussions over the years I&#39;ve seen different distinctions made <br/>\nabout &quot;radical.&quot;   Sometimes it involves whether there is any instruction.  <br/>\nSome people want to teach math facts and reading and other than that they&#39;re <br/>\nunschooling.  They&#39;re not radical unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it involves whether there&#39;s any separation of learning and other <br/>\nlife.  Some want to give their kids uninterrupted learning opportunities and <br/>\ntime to pursue their interests during &quot;school hours&quot; so that on a school day <br/>\nthey&#39;re free to do what they want as long as it seems somewhat justifiably <br/>\nschoolish.  And they might accept that Lego or sandbox play is schoolish because <br/>\nthere are math and engineering and physics and nature elements, and they want to <br/>\ndocument some of that.  But they might not want the kids to just sit and look <br/>\nout the window, or to read magazines about movie stars, or to play a video game <br/>\nduring that same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read that and thought, &quot;Yeah, but looking out the window, playing a <br/>\nvideo game or reading ANY magazine is still learning,&quot; then you&#39;re probably a <br/>\nradical unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is another division that considers whether unschooling has so <br/>\ntransformed the parents or the family that they have blurred the lines between <br/>\nlearning and any other part of life, and I think that&#39;s the line which causes <br/>\nconflict on this list at at the unschooling.com forum sometimes.  It has to do <br/>\nwith lifestyle other than project/learning/input.  What about bedtimes and food <br/>\nand chores and rules of interaction with the world?<br/>\n<br/>\nEach family has a point which is too far for them.  For me &quot;too far&quot; is when <br/>\na parent comes here and says they don&#39;t think it&#39;s their job to suggest <br/>\nanything for their kids to do, ever.  They don&#39;t think it&#39;s their job to comment on <br/>\ntheir children&#39;s interests.  They don&#39;t think it&#39;s unschooling if a parent <br/>\never directs anything or imposes his or her own interests on the child in any <br/>\nway.   See, I think that&#39;s justifying some kind of detached neglect, and I think <br/>\nit&#39;s stupid.   Yet there have been very VERY few of those over the years (and <br/>\nI think they were bullshitting anyway, or experimenting with a posture they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t actually hold and would say something different in a week or two).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there&#39;s my personal edge-of-the-world.  But I don&#39;t call them more radical <br/>\nthan I am.  I think they&#39;re just doofi or they&#39;re just saying what they think <br/>\nwill stir trouble.  (Do you imagine anyone would actually do that?  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink so years ago, but now I&#39;m sure they do because I&#39;ve heard their twisted <br/>\nconfessions of having disrupted lists and wasted people&#39;s time just for the <br/>\nthrill of being irritants.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to the real world as we know it and I would like to try to maintain <br/>\nit.  I think if people divide their lives into academic and non-academic, <br/>\nthey&#39;re not radical unschoolers.  I think unschooling in the context of a <br/>\ntraditional set of rules and parental requirements and expectations will work better <br/>\nthan structured school-at-home, but I don&#39;t think it will work as well for the <br/>\ndeveloping souls and minds of the children involved.  And those who are not <br/>\nradical unschoolers would look at that and say &quot;What do their souls have to do <br/>\nwith unschooling?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has to do with philosophy and priority.  I think the way I discuss whether <br/>\none of my teens can go to a movie or not under the circumstances of the <br/>\nmoment is as true and deep a life-building experience as when he asks me what <br/>\nsquares and square roots are about.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we had in various combinations and not all at once from seven to <br/>\nseventeen kids here.  It was a madhouse.  Seven was my low count because there <br/>\nare still seven here at the moment.  At one point two were gone and were coming <br/>\nback, one was half-expected (and did show up) and Marty wanted to go to the <br/>\ndollar movies to see &quot;School of Rock&quot; with a subset of the day&#39;s count.  Holly <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to go; her guest from England did.  Kirby half wanted to go; the <br/>\ngirls coming back wanted to see him particularly.  So the discussion with Marty <br/>\ninvolved me helping him review the schedule, the logistics of which and how <br/>\nmany cars, did he have cash, could he ask Kirby to stay, could we offer another <br/>\ntrip to that theater the next day for those who&#39;d missed it today, etc.    I <br/>\ncould have said &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; without detail, but it was important to me for <br/>\nit to be important to Marty to learn how to make those decisions.   Lots of <br/>\nfactors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s part of my personal style of radical unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.

The problem is that some people call<br/>\nthemselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; but they force the kids to do math, or they<br/>\n&quot;unschool&quot; after the kids get out of ps in the afternoons, or they require a<br/>\ncertain amount of reading each day.
