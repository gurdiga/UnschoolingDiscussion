I know I have enough milk for her. <br/>\nShe&#39;s not particularly hungry at the dinner table, she just wants to<br/>\nparticipate in something the rest of the family is obviously enjoying. <br/>\nI was also wondering if maybe her body requirements - since she is so<br/>\nbig - are not satisfied by breastmilk alone.  Like, I&#39;ve heard (T or F?)<br/>\nthat a one year old needs different nutrients than a newborn, so I was<br/>\nwondreing if that&#39;s because of size.  With Mook, we used a blender, and<br/>\nnever bought baby food.  He&#39;s so healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe special toy at dinnertime was a good idea.  I let her chew on the<br/>\ntips (I was holding them) of some clean chopsticks.  She LOVED that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also VERY interested in herbs, essential oils, and making soap,<br/>\ncandles, etc.  Somebody (sorry - I forgot who) posted a vegetarian soap<br/>\nmaking site (sunsoap.com), so I visited it, and got really interested. <br/>\nWhen we settle down (we&#39;ll be moving three times in three months!), I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to start making soaps and growing herbs, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7075,"nextTopicId":7113}}
