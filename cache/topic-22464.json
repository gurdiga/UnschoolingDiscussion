I really do not understand what you are trying to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that it makes any difference, but as frame of reference, I was<br/>\nborn in Idaho and spent my early years there.  I have extensive family still<br/>\nliving in all parts of Idaho, so I think I&#39;m fairly conversant with the<br/>\nattitudes of the general population in that area.  I was raised around guns,<br/>\nhave a healthy respect for them and know personally how to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...what I understand you to be saying is that somehow these children are<br/>\nnot likely to be afraid of police presence and attempts to remove them from<br/>\ntheir home after their father has very recently died, their mother is<br/>\narrested (based on personal experience, I can assume they have not had<br/>\ncontact with her since her arrest) because their upbringing has prepared<br/>\nthem for this?  That because they&#39;ve been taught to be self reliant and<br/>\nresponsible for themselves they are somehow not affected by what has been<br/>\nhappening in their family and home?<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the local police/sheriff&#39;s department appears to have shown<br/>\nenough restraint to not force the issue at gunpoint.  That was a pretty good<br/>\nmove on their part.  Still, I don&#39;t see how these children can possibly have<br/>\nbeen anything less than terrified.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hope I&#39;m misunderstanding this.  I do not understand how any child<br/>\nin this situation could be anything less than terrified.  I think their<br/>\nactions demonstrate their fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nPuzzled and trying to understand,<br/>\nEiraul<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brownville77@...\">Brownville77@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n(Eiraul says):<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I don&#39;t have enough first hand information about this case to really<br/>\nknow<br/>\n&gt; whether the officials&#39; actions were justified or not.  But I do have<br/>\nenough<br/>\n&gt; first hand experience to know this will be a traumatic experience for<br/>\nthese<br/>\n&gt; children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n(Nicki responds):<br/>\n&gt;     I would first like to say I am sorry you had such troubled times as a<br/>\n&gt; child. I can also understand what you are saying about the police<br/>\ninterfering<br/>\n&gt; and how it impressed you and still does. When dh was a teen he had a party<br/>\n&gt; and the police busted it and came in w/ weapons drawn. How ludicrous for<br/>\n&gt; busting a teen beer party. They can really go over the top.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    But this dept. was very careful from what I read b/c they didn&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; another Randy Weaver fiasco. This is Idaho and we have had our share of<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    I don&#39;t know many more details and I am glad they backed off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    Also I know a few families like this in reguard to training kids in<br/>\n&gt; weaponry. They are firm believers in anti gov&#39;t. and so on. These kids<br/>\n&gt; probably weren&#39;t as &quot;scared&quot; as you think. Some of these families imagine<br/>\n&gt; this scenario and are prepared for it. I personally know people who<br/>\nbelieve<br/>\n&gt; these things. It is pretty scary to listen to IMO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    NICKI~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22448,"nextTopicId":22447}}
