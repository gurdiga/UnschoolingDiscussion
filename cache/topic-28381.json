If she wanted to exclude those who <br/>\ncritize and/or question her, she would have never told me about the list. She <br/>\nand I have our share of disagreements, but there is a mutual respect and an <br/>\nability to move on past disagreements.  And it isn&#39;t meant to be private, <br/>\nbecause then she would have created a private list, not a public one as she <br/>\ndid. She hasn&#39;t told everyone on this list, because she is not a member <br/>\nanymore and cannot post here if she isn&#39;t a member (I think). I highly doubt <br/>\nthe new list will be dull and full of &quot;I agree&quot; posts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I know about it is that I CC&#39;d her on the post I wrote that had <br/>\ninformation about her when she left the list. That felt like the right thing <br/>\nto do to me. She wrote back to tell me she was thinking of starting another <br/>\nlist and did I want info on it. I replied I did. Very simple. . . no trying <br/>\nto keep things private at all. I did not feel like I wanted to post all of <br/>\nthe information about that list on here, so I am giving her that option, as <br/>\nLIsa requested. As I said, she is the moderator and will make decisions on <br/>\nthat list accordingly. I have no problems either way with lists being <br/>\nmoderated or not. I am on both types and seem to function fine either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kathy","from":"&quot;Kathy&quot; &lt;laurawilder82@...&gt;","profile":"laurawilder82","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xMHwsQFKwvchWIgP5hyGMCAwvmb36m_jXDPnKPEkwvXEl8L2x1M4ejVnpKnuuYs2IeNOX8gMRi2iScdEPv6_LHfFjkbiP88U","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sandra&#39;s list (not)","postDate":"1006780063","msgId":28547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl0dGVxdithdGRuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYTcwMWMxNzYwZiRmNTVlYzNlMCQ0NjFjOTNhOEBpZm5ldC5lZHU+"},"prevInTopic":28542,"nextInTopic":28549,"prevInTime":28546,"nextInTime":28548,"topicId":28381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know lovemary will forward your request, but I think the point of Sandra s new list is to be private.

So here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of days ago I sent off my Explanation As to Why I Cannot Arrange<br/>\nfor Alternate Care During My Period of Jury Service (this is the wording<br/>\nfrom the form sent to me). Im pasting what I sent below.<br/>\n<br/>\nNYC recently (a few years ago, I think) did away with all the automatic<br/>\nexemptions to jury duty. I dont know what the age was, but it used to be<br/>\nthat if you were the sole caregiver for a child under a certain age, that<br/>\ns all you had to prove. Now they require an Explanation of some sort,<br/>\napparently even for the mother of a newborn. Our son will be about two<br/>\nyears, seven months old this Friday, which is when I would be required to<br/>\nstart calling in for jury duty (I would be on standby, listening to a<br/>\nprerecorded message telling me whether to report or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advice a local La Leche League Leader gave me initially was to just say<br/>\nthat I was breastfeeding. But I dont feel thats my real reason. Even if we<br/>\nwerent breastfeeding now, I wouldnt feel right about leaving our son with<br/>\nanybody for hours and hours on end. Besides, it has occurred to me that a<br/>\nclerk could just say, Why dont you use a breastpump? I also thought that<br/>\nbreastfeeding a toddler is weird enough in this society that it might<br/>\nnot go over well. (But then again, attachment is weird, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I wrote the explanation out, I was remembering some things John Holt said<br/>\nabout strategy in the original edition of Teach Your Own, which came out at<br/>\na time when the legal right to homeschool/unschool hadnt been defined or<br/>\ndebated much.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said that it was important to show that you were opting out of school<br/>\nbecause of deeply held convictions (not because of a passing fancy or out of<br/>\nlaziness); that you would be willing to fight (in the courts) for your right<br/>\nto do so; that letting you go ahead with it wasnt likely to open the<br/>\nfloodgates to overwhelming numbers of others wanting to do the same, but<br/>\nthat, at the same time, you would probably be able to find others to support<br/>\nyou in your fight (hence my listing of three books, and my choice to use the<br/>\nterm attachment parenting even though I have been inspired more directly<br/>\nby Jean Liedloff, not Dr. Sears).<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn also said you should use certified mail (I did), and not talk much on<br/>\nthe phone so you can get it all in writing (I didnt put my phone number on<br/>\nthe Explanation, but its on the form I had to send in with it). Im going<br/>\nto be interested to see how these tips work when its the court itself,<br/>\nrather than the school district or whatever, that youre dealing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bottom of the explanation, I handwrote the phrase, Note: This is not<br/>\npart of an application for a postponement, but for a hardship/excuse. My<br/>\nfear is not that Ill be denied anything, but that theyll find it<br/>\nconvenient to grant me a simple postponement.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo apply for a postponement, you dont have to give any reasons or<br/>\nexplanations or proof. You just give a date from two to six months down the<br/>\nroad when you will be available. The catch is that you can only do this<br/>\nonce. So if I use up my right to postpone now, rather than getting a<br/>\nhardship/excuse, I will have lost my opportunity to postpone for reasons<br/>\nof my own convenience (work, vacation, etc.) We also hope to have more<br/>\nchildren in the future, so I dont want to establish a pattern of being<br/>\nwilling to accept a postponement.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I didnt specify when I expect to be available, because it depends<br/>\non how our son develops emotionally, though I did refer to the age of three<br/>\nas a common approximate age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may all become moot if we move, as we hope to. (Im thirty-five, but<br/>\nhave never served on a jury before because Ive lived in twenty-six<br/>\ndifferent places, including nine years in Spain.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder Postponements, the form I got said that you should assume youd been<br/>\ngranted one unless you were contacted. It didnt say anything about this<br/>\nunder Hardships/Excuses, so I dont know what Im supposed to do if I don<br/>\nt hear anything by Friday. I also dont know whom you can make an appeal to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe form says, Failure to appear may subject you to non-compliance<br/>\nhearings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Id appreciate any advice or constructive criticism. Heres the<br/>\nExplanation:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY I CANNOT ARRANGE FOR ALTERNATE<br/>\n CARE DURING  MY PERIOD OF JURY SERVICE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(SUBMITTED AS PART OF MY REQUEST FOR A HARDSHIP/EXCUSE) :<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I practice attachment parenting, as described in the<br/>\nfollowing books (among others):<br/>\n<br/>\nAttachment Parenting. Katie Allison Granju with Betsy Kennedy, R.N., M.S.N.<br/>\nNew York: Simon and Schuster, 1999.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Baby Book. Dr. William Sears, M.D., and Martha Sears, R.N. New York:<br/>\nLittle, Brown and Co., 1993.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Continuum Concept. Jean Liedloff. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1985.<br/>\nFirst published: 1977. (This book does not refer to attachment parenting,<br/>\nas the term was coined by Dr. Sears some years after its original<br/>\npublication, but it advocates similar principles.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAttachment parenting requires (among other things) that the primary<br/>\ncaregiver/s, usually the mother, be continuously available to the child, day<br/>\nand night, for approximately the first three years of life, depending on the<br/>\nemotional development of the individual child.<br/>\nThe longest period of time our son has ever been apart from me (aside from<br/>\nthe several hours following his birth by emergency C-section) was for three<br/>\nhours and thirty-five minutes, and this was as recently as November 14th,<br/>\nwhen I attended a funeral which was a ten-minute walk away from the<br/>\nalternate caregivers house. She (a close friend) was willing to bring my<br/>\nson to me if he really needed me. (He didnt cry, but did ask for me several<br/>\ntimes, and toward the end of this time needed to go out and sit on the front<br/>\nsteps to wait for me.)<br/>\nThe second-longest time my son has ever been apart from me in his life was<br/>\nfor one hour and fifteen minutes this past summer, when on his own<br/>\ninitiative he joined a group of children and one adult in going to the<br/>\nplayground across the street from where I was taking part in a meeting. He<br/>\nwas brought to me on his request at the end of this time.<br/>\nThe third-longest period of time he has ever been apart from me has been on<br/>\nthe several occasions when he went out for a walk of about an hour with his<br/>\nfather  on these occasions, he would have been brought to me sooner if he<br/>\nhad asked.<br/>\nI understand this countrys need for jurors, but also understand that it<br/>\nmust be balanced against the rights of individual citizens to parent their<br/>\nchildren in the way they see fit. I hope these specific descriptions of my<br/>\nsons experiences to date will make clear to you that he is unusually<br/>\nattached to his mother, compared to other children in this culture. I<br/>\nbelieve that there are very few parents who would be able to honestly give<br/>\nsimilar descriptions.<br/>\nI know that many parents in this culture feel that it is good for a child<br/>\nto be forcibly removed from the mothers care for hours at a time, from the<br/>\nearliest age, and no matter how hard the child cries. My husband and I have<br/>\nmade a different choice.<br/>\nWe have expended an enormous amount of effort (and sacrificed my own<br/>\ncontribution to the family income) in order to assure our son this<br/>\ncontinuity of care. We have done so for the reasons set forth in the three<br/>\nbooks indicated above, and in accordance with parenting practices followed<br/>\nuntil the historically recent past in this country, and still followed in<br/>\nmany other parts of the world (where both the child and adult populations,<br/>\nperhaps not coincidentally, exhibit fewer psychological problems than is<br/>\ntrue here).<br/>\nI dont ask that anyone agree with us in our choice of parenting styles <br/>\nonly that this choice be respected until our son is capable of a longer<br/>\nseparation, and one in which he would not have the option of being brought<br/>\nto me.<br/>\nThank you for your attention.

Other people usually ask the same question I <br/>\nwould have, anyway. And I always read everything, never blindly <br/>\ndelete.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so profoundly saddened by what I have seen transpire in the past <br/>\nfew days on this list. That&#39;s all I will say about that. I feel way <br/>\ntoo much has been said already.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that I want to say is thank you Lisa Bugg and Helen for <br/>\nhaving the forsight to start both unschooling-dotcom and also <br/>\nunschooling.com, even if it was long before I ever heard of <br/>\nunschooling. I appreciate these forums so much. Sandra and so many <br/>\nothers have helped me become a better person and a better mother. I <br/>\ndoubt if these changes would have happened if I had not run across <br/>\nunschooling.com shortly before 9-11. Since then, what a personal <br/>\njourney it has been, for me and my family. I am grateful to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has been talk of un-subbing and the member count is noticeably <br/>\ndropping now. But I will stay, and probably mostly lurk, for I still <br/>\nhave much learning (and unlearning) to do. I will also hope that <br/>\nSandra and others leaving will find it in their heart to come back, <br/>\nfor I will miss them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;LisaBugg&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If you (Sandra) leave, I will leave since this group won&#39;t be <br/>\nworth<br/>\n&gt; subscribing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to any longer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;These things have a way of running their course. Just let it run <br/>\nout of<br/>\n&gt; gas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You know, I think I&#39;ve been silent way too long.  When Mark and <br/>\nHelen came<br/>\n&gt; to me and asked if I was interested in developing unschooling.com <br/>\nwith them<br/>\n&gt; I jumped at the chance.  It&#39;s been an exciting, fulfilling, labor <br/>\nof love.<br/>\n&gt; Our goal was to create an unschooling networking community.  A <br/>\ncommunity<br/>\n&gt; where support and resources were shared. Where are goals and dreams <br/>\nwere<br/>\n&gt; given a voice.  Those of us who have worked within the homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; community for a long time have seen many changes over the years and <br/>\nright<br/>\n&gt; now we are in a very difficult period.  So many people are fleeing a<br/>\n&gt; crumbling public system that the joys of homeschooling and the <br/>\nvaluable<br/>\n&gt; lessons we have garnered over the years threatened to be <br/>\noverwhelmed by<br/>\n&gt; worry and panic.  At this point in time ALL of our voices matter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have known Sandra a long time. I&#39;ve spent a week living in her <br/>\nhome. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; traveled to other states just to be able to have some face to face <br/>\ntime with<br/>\n&gt; her.  She should have a very clear understanding of just how <br/>\nimportant she<br/>\n&gt; has been in my own life and evolution.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are unschoolers with 15 - 20 -25 years of experience on this <br/>\nlist.<br/>\n&gt; There are many authors and conference speakers.  We have writers <br/>\ngalore.<br/>\n&gt; There are 600! people who have access to this list.  I am hearing <br/>\nfrom long<br/>\n&gt; time friends that they aren&#39;t going to read and respond here <br/>\nanymore. The<br/>\n&gt; owner is talking about unseeing from the list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These last two months of constant, almost uninterrupted, fighting <br/>\nhave me<br/>\n&gt; hating my own work.  This kind of personal bickering will not just <br/>\nrun out<br/>\n&gt; of gas.  There are many of us simply not speaking up on the list <br/>\nbecause we<br/>\n&gt; know no matter what is said, no matter what the topic, the subject <br/>\nis going<br/>\n&gt; to always come back to I did/I did not/Look what she said. It&#39;s <br/>\nsimply<br/>\n&gt; untenable.  It&#39;s ruining the sense of community I have spent <br/>\nhelping to<br/>\n&gt; build during the last 3 years.
