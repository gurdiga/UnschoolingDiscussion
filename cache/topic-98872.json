If you live in or around Louisiana and are an unschooler, or are <br/>\ninterested in learning more about unschooling, please check out our list.  <br/>\nThere are already lots of links for book recommendations, essays and <br/>\narticles, resources and much more...not to mention some very cute photos of Louisiana <br/>\nUnschooler kids  : )  After joining, please feel free to add your own favorite <br/>\nlinks and photos.<br/>\nOur newest member, Valerie Fitzenreiter from Lake Charles, authored the book, <br/>\nThe Unprocessed Child.  Valerie radically unschooled her daughter, Laurie, <br/>\nfrom birth (Laurie is presently up in Baton Rouge getting her Ph.D.).  They will <br/>\nboth be coming to New Orleans to speak to Louisiana Unschoolers in December <br/>\nat a mini-conference we are in the process of organizing!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is for unschoolers in the state of Louisiana and interested <br/>\nMississippians to make connections and find support with like-minded people; plan and <br/>\nattend field trips around the state and share resources.
