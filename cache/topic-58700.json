We went down to the <br/>\npond and mucked out their Tonka trucks which had layed in the pond mud for <br/>\nthe last year largely ignored.<br/>\nWe got them scrubbed off (I&#39;m surprised no frogs had taken up residence) and <br/>\nthe kids found an area of the yard to dig in for the day.  This inspired me <br/>\nto get an area on the side of the house cleaned up for them.  <br/>\nTrevor had joined us at this point and helped me haul a bunch of pine needles <br/>\nup to the street, raking and uncovering some garden beds we put in last year.<br/>\nAll this dirt play, raking and WORK was being done at the exclusion of <br/>\ntv/video games. <br/>\nThey had full choice, but they chose outside yesterday.<br/>\nTrevor drifted in and out, watching tv and playing games some and then <br/>\nhanging out with the rest of us outside for periods of time.<br/>\nThe other three spent the ENTIRE day outside, only coming in to eat or drink <br/>\nor use the bathroom.<br/>\nThey built dirt castles, sculpted a dolphin in the dirt, raked, hoed, planned <br/>\na fort, planted garlic in a garden bed, mucked around by the pond and dug <br/>\nwith their Tonka trucks.<br/>\nLater, we all went out for pizza (at Sams club of all places) and Jared <br/>\npicked out a new GBA game, &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;.  We stopped and rented a movie <br/>\non the way home and while the rest of us watched Men in Black 2, Jared sat <br/>\nwith us and played his game, barely looking up.<br/>\nFree choice is awesome and powerful stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
