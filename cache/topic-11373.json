They are similar to musadines which are wild grapes.<br/>\nScuppernongs are brown when ripe and have very thick skins (muscadines are<br/>\ndark purple and also have the thick skins).  You simply squeeze them into<br/>\nyour mouth and swallow them whole.....some folks never get the hang of it,<br/>\nlike my husband.  If you try to chew them, even without the skins, there are<br/>\ntoo many seeds.  So you just squeeze directly into your mouth, pointing the<br/>\nspot which pulled from the vine into your mouth, swallow the &quot;guts&quot; and<br/>\ndiscard the skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe made jelly & jam, Grandma made wine, but I love them best standing under<br/>\nthe vine with the bees buzzing round!   Sometimes I can ocassionally find<br/>\nthem in a grocery store but they are usually green.  These days I visit a<br/>\ngrower near my grandparents home in NC, they are ripe in the fall, late<br/>\nAugust thru September.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"The White&#39;s","from":"&quot;The White&#39;s&quot; &lt;jwwjr@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"iq-XnPb-X-MsI-MCLfkS-Lmkm1P-0gXjPsF7YMkvIZmIpF49mfJom4YkfyBABZxfB7K75bUUTgodKhtzV2vjQF7eIcQLy-iS","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"tobacco &quot;tea&quot;","postDate":"964056976","msgId":11373,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWJmZjFlYSRlNjE3NmY0MCQwZGYyMGJkMEBuZW9jb21tLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11407,"prevInTime":11372,"nextInTime":11374,"topicId":11373,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" been in the ...
