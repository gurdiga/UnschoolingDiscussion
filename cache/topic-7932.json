TV seems to be an issue in my house. If I let Shawn watch all he wants and whatever he wants I find that his behavior deteriorates...so do you find that some things need to be controlled until a certain maturity occurs? or am I being too concerned over it?  I fully intend and consider myself unschooling. I don&#39;t expect Shawn to DO anything other than behave like any normal 3 yr old...and sometimes he truly surprises me and I think I have a 5 yr old in the house! He is very articulate and loves documentaries and movies about mummies. We&#39;ve had a number of conversations-which he initiated-on why people die and what happens etc, etc. He loves watching Nik jr and Disney and Noggin....and at night he always wants to watch Junkyard Wars on TLC  and of course on the weekend he cant get enough of Monster Jam on TNN :)  My boy loves monster trucks...well actually all form of motor vehicles. And my 11 month old girl seems to also enjoy playing cars and says vrrooom quite clearly.  She also kisses all the stuffed animals and dolls in the house...of her own initiative:)  I am continually amazed at the difference between them that seems to be solely due to gender differences as I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t parent her much differently than I did him at the same age. Have any of you come across this in your family???<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was  a lot longer than I intended...guess I&#39;m no longer lurking:)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth- busy mommy to Shawn and Shannon, my precious angels.<br/>\n<br/>\noh...today we started intense potty training....I think I&#39;m not using the unschooling method here because I initiated it, but Shawn had NO accidents today and went to bathroom to pee a number of times without telling me! So I&#39;m pretty sure my gut instincts were right and he is ready, but was holding out for the attention due to little sister. What is your experience with this?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Karin <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, March 11, 2002 5:17 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Vivian,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Completely off topic, but have you read The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood?

It will push them to search the net, again reading. They will<br/>\n  start to do &quot;research&quot; which may involve looking in the library catalog<br/>\n  system for more books and videos. They may hear of Jane Goodall giving a<br/>\n  seminar on chimps and ask to go to that.

They will want to do that too.<br/>\n  You mentioned seeing progress. My children are progressing every day. So am<br/>\n  I. What type of progress are you looking for? Progress through the school<br/>\n  curriculums? That&#39;s not going to happen, they are learning naturally and<br/>\n  school learning is unnatural.<br/>\n  Are they interested in things? anything? even if it is TV, video games,<br/>\n  aggressive skating or other non-schooly things, that&#39;s ok.

For years, I thought my girls <br/>\n  weren&#39;t learning anything.  I worried but for various reasons didn&#39;t <br/>\n  push them into more structure.  Looking back on it, that was just a <br/>\n  combination of luck and following my heart.  My head was worrying, but <br/>\n  in my heart I was sure they were fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And now, I have an even better reason to be confident in the girls.  <br/>\n  I&#39;ve seen the other side and know that it is recognizable if you watch <br/>\n  the right signs.  My son was not so much unmotivated but incapable of <br/>\n  learning on his own.  He was becoming unhappier and unhealthy by the <br/>\n  day.  To say I was becoming concerned is an understatement.  <br/>\n  Fortunately, at just about the time I started really worrying, my mom <br/>\n  move into the other house on this property.  SHe is a retired school <br/>\n  teacher and was quite capable of figuring out exactly what he needed <br/>\n  to learn.  He goes to her house daily for &quot;school&quot; and is quite happy <br/>\n  about it.  His unhappiness was frustration at the fact that he needed <br/>\n  more than I could give him.  He needs structure.  In fact, his daily <br/>\n  schedule is being disrupted this week.  He goes back to grandma&#39;s in <br/>\n  the afternoon to watch his TV shows in the quiet house and she took a <br/>\n  tutoring job and won&#39;t be home so he&#39;ll have to watch here now.  I&#39;m <br/>\n  not looking forward to the adjustment period. <br/>\n<br/>\n  But the difference was that while the girls were looking unmotivated, <br/>\n  they were never particularly unhappy.  And now, the amount of <br/>\n  knowledge they have crammed in their heads amazes even me.  Rachel <br/>\n  knows more about plants and gardening than I ever thought possible.  <br/>\n  They both know tons of science.  In fact the chem class they go to is <br/>\n  really not teaching them a lot that they didn&#39;t already know.  They <br/>\n  just go to play with the lab equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really believe that if you are in touch with your children and truly <br/>\n  listen to their needs, you will know if they are getting what they <br/>\n  need.  Just make sure that you are listening to them and not to what <br/>\n  some outside cultural influence is telling you they should be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;vivrh&quot; &lt;vivrh@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; I dont have any specific questions.

For years, I thought my girls <br/>\nweren&#39;t learning anything.  I worried but for various reasons didn&#39;t <br/>\npush them into more structure.  Looking back on it, that was just a <br/>\ncombination of luck and following my heart.  My head was worrying, but <br/>\nin my heart I was sure they were fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, I have an even better reason to be confident in the girls.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen the other side and know that it is recognizable if you watch <br/>\nthe right signs.  My son was not so much unmotivated but incapable of <br/>\nlearning on his own.  He was becoming unhappier and unhealthy by the <br/>\nday.  To say I was becoming concerned is an understatement.  <br/>\nFortunately, at just about the time I started really worrying, my mom <br/>\nmove into the other house on this property.  SHe is a retired school <br/>\nteacher and was quite capable of figuring out exactly what he needed <br/>\nto learn.  He goes to her house daily for &quot;school&quot; and is quite happy <br/>\nabout it.  His unhappiness was frustration at the fact that he needed <br/>\nmore than I could give him.  He needs structure.  In fact, his daily <br/>\nschedule is being disrupted this week.  He goes back to grandma&#39;s in <br/>\nthe afternoon to watch his TV shows in the quiet house and she took a <br/>\ntutoring job and won&#39;t be home so he&#39;ll have to watch here now.  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot looking forward to the adjustment period. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the difference was that while the girls were looking unmotivated, <br/>\nthey were never particularly unhappy.  And now, the amount of <br/>\nknowledge they have crammed in their heads amazes even me.  Rachel <br/>\nknows more about plants and gardening than I ever thought possible.  <br/>\nThey both know tons of science.  In fact the chem class they go to is <br/>\nreally not teaching them a lot that they didn&#39;t already know.  They <br/>\njust go to play with the lab equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really believe that if you are in touch with your children and truly <br/>\nlisten to their needs, you will know if they are getting what they <br/>\nneed.  Just make sure that you are listening to them and not to what <br/>\nsome outside cultural influence is telling you they should be doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;vivrh&quot; &lt;vivrh@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I dont have any specific questions.
