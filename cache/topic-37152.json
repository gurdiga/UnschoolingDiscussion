He was in <br/>\n&quot;first grade&quot; at a Montessori school.  Since the time he was born, we had <br/>\nalways planned not to put him in school at all, but he always craved being <br/>\nwith other kids, and friend of mine had told me about this particular <br/>\nschool and that the director/teacher had a very open mind and that there <br/>\nwas a strong environmental theme to the school.  A couple of his good <br/>\nfriends were going there, too, so when he was 4 years old, I set him there <br/>\ntwo afternoons a week just to see if he liked it or not.  He really did <br/>\nlike it.  There was a lot for him to do, and there was a strong drama and <br/>\narts component which he really liked.  He also liked being able to play <br/>\nwith the other kids, which is his absolute favorite thing.  I let the <br/>\nteacher know that I absolutely did not want anyone pushing academic stuff <br/>\non him unless he initiated it or asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next year I asked him if he wanted to stay and go into kindergarten.  I <br/>\nwould involve going there five full days, but he would be able to continue <br/>\nwith the same teacher, and we saw each other frequently and became friends, <br/>\nand she continued to respect my wishes about following his lead.  He seemed <br/>\nto be liking it there, but he was starting to show signs (which I ignored <br/>\nto my shame now) that he was not liking it so much.  He didn&#39;t want to go <br/>\nto school but when he got there he really liked it and at the end of the <br/>\nday he did not to leave so fast.  I thought this was due to inertia, and I <br/>\ndid nothing to change it.  Occasionally, he would really resist going to <br/>\nschool, and then I would try to find out what was bugging him and then he <br/>\nand his teacher and I would have a sit-down and work it out.  His teacher <br/>\nwould always let him know that she loved him very much and wanted him to be <br/>\nhappy there.  She would do everything she could to make him feel more <br/>\ncomfortable there by changing whatever it was that was bothering him.  For <br/>\nexample, when he didn&#39;t understand something, he felt uncomfortable about <br/>\nasking about, so she let him know that he could come to her anytime he was <br/>\npuzzled about something and they could go somewhere private and she&#39;d <br/>\nexplain things to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was WONDERFUL, but she was not his only teacher, and when he was in the <br/>\n&quot;first&quot; grade (in K-1-2 class) there was a lot of pressure on him to do the <br/>\nacademic work.  He really started hating it.  All he really wanted to do <br/>\nwas play with his friends and play with playdough.  Playing with his <br/>\nfriends during work time was frowned upon and he&#39;d get in trouble for <br/>\nthat.  And, he got the hairy eyeball when he spent too much time playing <br/>\nwith playdough.  His teacher decided that she would regard him as a <br/>\nkindergartener and keep him in a &quot;kindergarten curriculum.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my epiphany that all this was way wrong for him this past February <br/>\nand abruptly took him out of school.  He was ecstatic!  I told him that we <br/>\nwould be &quot;unschooling,&quot; and that I would follow his lead.  He understood <br/>\nthat if he wanted to know something or do something he could ask me.  I <br/>\nalso told him that I would offer things to do, but that he didn&#39;t need to <br/>\nfeel obligated to do it if it wasn&#39;t interesting to him.  We bought a TV <br/>\nset with a VCR (the first we had ever had; we don&#39;t have TV reception or <br/>\ncable though), and he can watch whatever tapes he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, here&#39;s what&#39;s got me now.  One of the things I have noticed about <br/>\nLiam is that he seems to have a very fragile self image.  He is either an <br/>\nexpert at something (anything) the first time he attempts it or he&#39;s a <br/>\ntotal failure and stinks at it.  He has a real hard time playing a friendly <br/>\ngame of anything because if he doesn&#39;t win, it absolutely crushes him.  I <br/>\nknow that lots of kids go through that, but it daunts me nevertheless.  I <br/>\nknow he&#39;ll generally grow out of it, but what troubles me now is that he <br/>\nseems to be avoiding things he wants to do because he feels he&#39;s no good at <br/>\nthem.   Here&#39;s an example.  This morning he wanted to write some words.  He <br/>\nasked me how to write &quot;opera is closed&quot; and then &quot;opera is on fire.&quot;  I <br/>\nwrote them out for him to copy.  He got very upset because he wrote the &quot;c&quot; <br/>\ntoo close to the &quot;s&quot; in the first phrase.  After that, he got very angry <br/>\nwith himself, and there was nothing that I could say to him to encourage <br/>\nhim to try again.  He told me that he wanted to learn how to read and write <br/>\nbut that he just couldn&#39;t.  He told me that a 7-year-old ought to be able <br/>\nto do these things, and he seemed to feel that he was defective (my word, <br/>\nnot his) because of his inability to do things &quot;everyone else&quot; can.  Even <br/>\nthough I told him that there are some expert readers in the world who did <br/>\nnot start reading until they were 10 and 15 years old, he was not comforted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, I don&#39;t know what to do.  Now, he has indicated to me that he <br/>\nwants to be able to do these things (though not so much because HE wants it <br/>\nas much as he feels defective for not being able to).  I confess that I <br/>\nreally don&#39;t know how to help him.  I know he is still decompressing from <br/>\nhis brief school experience.  His passion is Power Rangers and Star Wars <br/>\nand that kind of thing.  He likes watching them on TV, he likes having <br/>\nanything about Star Wars or Power Rangers read to him.  He likes making up <br/>\nPower Rangers dramas for himself or he and his friends and playing these <br/>\nout, either alone or with his friends.  I have the closed caption option on <br/>\nthe TV turned on and the words that are being said are also visible on the <br/>\nscreen; I figure that he&#39;ll start recognizing some words that way.  I was <br/>\nable to remind him that he read the word &quot;off&quot; the other day, and that <br/>\nseemed to help his psyche a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a bit at sea with this.  I&#39;d love to hear about similar experiences, <br/>\nand I&#39;d love to get some advice about how I can help him see that he is an <br/>\nable person but that he can&#39;t expect to be an expert right out of the gate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks very much!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112127147,"authorName":"Shelly G","from":"Shelly G &lt;shellyrae00@...&gt;","profile":"shellyrae00","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] May I share?","postDate":"1021904902","msgId":37159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNTIwMTQyODIyLjE1OTM2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIxNTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNS4xNWY3ODc4ZC4yYTFhNTY0OUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37155,"nextInTopic":37162,"prevInTime":37158,"nextInTime":37160,"topicId":37152,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not worrying about her <br/>\nattendance, despite the fact that earaches are common and painful for her, <br/>\namong other chronic illnesses she has had, with little compassion from her <br/>\nteachers. Teachers that won&#39;t let her go to the bathroom because this<br/>\ndistracted and impulsive child lost her 8 bathroom &quot;tickets&quot; for the nine <br/>\nweeks. It&#39;s no wonder she has suffered from chronic constipation and <br/>\nencropretic soiling. Teachers that wouldn&#39;t let her go call home, until she <br/>\nwas crying and begging, and they didn&#39;t bother to even check that she had a <br/>\nfever, that didn&#39;t appear until after I sheepishly sent her to school, <br/>\nbecause I had to draw a line that she can&#39;t just miss school for not feeling <br/>\nher best, I<br/>\nneeded a fever or puke as valid reasons. I can distinctly remember at her <br/>\nprevious school district (she went to one k-3rd, then we moved and I though a <br/>\nnew district would help for 4th HAHA), I was calling her in sick but stated <br/>\nshe may be coming in late, since I didn&#39;t know if it was genuine or a school <br/>\navoidance tactic. The (insert TOSABLE expletive here) principal suggested I <br/>\nhang up and threaten her to call the police for incorrigible behavior,<br/>\nbecause truancy is illegal. This same (insert again) principal who told me <br/>\nthe school would do nothing for my ADHD-type daughter in the way of providing <br/>\nindividual or custom environment to help her learning style. He suggested we <br/>\nmedicate her, because by law that was all he could do. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinding old schoolpapers stuffed in the back of her desk drawer, so glad this <br/>\nbusywork is no longer a source of stress and conflict for our family. <br/>\nMemories of the battle that ensued, when she would constantly &quot;lose&quot; her <br/>\nassignment, &quot;forget&quot; to write assignments down, or flat out tell me she had <br/>\nno homework when she did. Refusing to study for a test, telling the teacher <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t need to, the teacher calling me about it, then Megan getting a <br/>\nperfect<br/>\nscore on it. The teacher who also called Megan to the front of the room, to <br/>\npublicly embarrass her, by having her crying, calling her mother from the <br/>\ndesk phone in front of the entire class to try to tell me she was missing her <br/>\nassignment again. She couldn&#39;t choke up the words, as I demanded to talk to <br/>\nthat teacher now and blast her for attempting such a ridiculous stunt, when <br/>\nshe could have let me know there was problem before this, and scheduled a<br/>\nconference. The resulting conference that I demanded with all her teachers, <br/>\nwhere I was put on the stand to defend our family habits, reassuring: no, <br/>\nMegan does not have a TV in her room, yes, we do discipline her with love and <br/>\nconsistency, yes, we are her natural parents with no divorce or stepfamily or <br/>\nlive-in lovers, and no, I don&#39;t think bribing her with candy bars would be an <br/>\neffective means of getting her to conform and perform. Finally<br/>\nredirecting these ladies to stop the faultfinding and come up with a <br/>\nsolution, that I did alone, with no input, and no subsequent consistent <br/>\nfollow-up, to make sure she had the right assignments written down, in <br/>\nPEN...........shall I continue? No I will spare you anymore laborious details <br/>\nLOL<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, these horrible, sometimes painful, memories are affirmations that she is <br/>\nwhere she belongs, home with a family that loves her, supports her, knows her <br/>\nand cares for her better than someone more &quot;qualified&quot; to baby-sit her, a <br/>\nmother that has a hard time escaping the guilt of letting such a harmful <br/>\ncharade continue so long, but has faith in God&#39;s timing that everything that <br/>\nhas happened was for reason, and thanking God that I have such a<br/>\n&quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;challenging&quot;, or &quot;spirited&quot; child, for if not, I might still <br/>\nbelieve that school was just fine, if not necessary for a &quot;proper&quot; education, <br/>\nsocialization was just a hard, necessary lesson to endure, and that it&#39;s <br/>\nnormal and healthy to surrender my precious child over to this institution. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, the sound of that same school bus, at almost 4pm, even though <br/>\nthe school is five minutes away, hard to believe that is has gotten so late, <br/>\nwe lost track of time in the backyard, chasing bugs, watching for <br/>\nhummingbirds, fishing and catching dozens of bluegills in the pond, and the <br/>\nabsolute pity I feel for the unsuspecting parents and kids getting off the <br/>\nbus, who don&#39;t have time to come play, they have homework and are way <br/>\noverscheduled<br/>\neach evening, wishing they could know the joy we have found.......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\nSAHM to<br/>\nMegan Elizabeth 8/8/92 8lbs 8oz<br/>\nAshlyn Olivia 7/25/99 9lbs 8oz<br/>\n Christian James 6/09/01 9lbs 5oz<br/>\n   &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;\">http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;</a>&gt;Meet MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt;   <br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;</a>&gt;Christian&#39;s Birth Story&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Girls page&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n|w|w|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37255,"nextTopicId":37287}}
