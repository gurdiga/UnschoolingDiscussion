She had fun. She mentened to Grandma about youngest and middle child left and she kinda was shaming her {middle child}a bit. I told her that I was behind her {my dd&#39;s decision} and I didn&#39;t want her to feel bad about it. She mentioned she should be old enough not to do that. I reminded her we all age emotionally different. But her rules she said would still be {and she would tell them up front} if they make the promise to stay they will stay. {we live right next door BTW.} She mentioned that it hurts her a bit when they do it. I reminded again children see things in a different way because they haven&#39;t completely developed. But I do see it as her house her rules. And in the end if they go it will be their choice {because I will be sure they will know what to expect if they change their mind}. I am always here for them and they are always welcome. And she isn&#39;t trying to harm them, and i have to trust them to be able to make that choice. {at least the 7 and oldest that is almost 10} I would ask if the 3 year old wanted to leave, she should be able to because she isn&#39;t young enough to understand the consequence. They have gone on trips with her happily to the beach and though a bit homesick, they made it through and were happy they went. {this is my two oldest, my youngest hasn&#39;t done that yet, she is a bit more of a hand full and very much a mama&#39;s girl. &lt;g&gt;Make sense or does anyone have any other suggestions?

We kinda knew it would happen and let them go if they want, but always welcome them home. A few times they were stuck because whomever they were staying the night with wouldn&#39;t call us to pick them up. {we didn&#39;t think we needed to give them permission because we told the kids they could always call us, but the adult would intervine} &quot;Brother&quot; has been good about it so the kids say and he brought them both times himself, but I did make sure to tell them that I would be glad to pick them up and they always have the &quot;out&quot; to come home. And  I did warn them in advance that it might happen.I am sure this only adds to some people thinking &quot;poor kids&quot; because they missed us. To me, I feel blessed my kids really love us like that and feel comfortable enough to try but know they are always welcome home. And we welcome them back with a little joking about it and a lot of love, but nothing shunning them that they didn&#39;t meet some expectation we had. I remember being stuck someplace and not happy after the evening went on. I felt so out of control and never wanted my kids to feel that.&quot;Brother&quot; {what we call my BIL} said he might see us again in another 45 minutes. If my oldest {9} decides she really misses us too. Ether way is fine.Just thought I&#39;d share.Tracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
