My children are 5 4  and two.  Smile <br>\n With that said, I am hoping someone out there might be able to shout some good suggestions my way.<br>\nI am looking for things activities movies etc. that  I can have around the house  that will help foster my children&#39;s love of learning. Things such as good DVDs about nature, books etc. One hard aspects about finding such things is that me and my husband are both totally blind, so we cannot read a lot of mainstream books and less they are adapted. My son in particular loves learning new things, and when he has activities around he will choose to do the activities that challenge his brain more often than not. Fun  websites that they could visit would also be helpful. They both have their own computers, and with our assistance should be able to do some of the fun website activities that are out there. <br>\nThey all love movies, and I would love some recommendations on good-quality documentaries etc. for this age group. We love doing crafts together, but I have a very difficult time coming up with craft ideas for them. They do make up their own stuff, but they also like some ideas of things they could make.<br>\nMy son who is five, has shown an immense interest in writing his own superhero story. We are currently looking for a program an app for their iPods or some other method of helping him write the story, and compose pictures. I know Microsoft word seems like the obvious choice, but due to our vision problems, we are unable to use the clip art that goes along with it.<br>\nAre there any children&#39;s encyclopedias for the iPod etc. that do not require children to be able to read in order to utilize?<br>\n<br>\nWe do not intend on using any of these activities or tools to force them to utilize them, but we want to have them available if they ask or show interest in using them.<br>\nI guess I am just having a hard time finding the things I am looking for. I am certain if I were cited this wouldn&#39;t be as difficult, but the vision loss definitely throws a wrench in some of the things I would like to utilize.<br>\nThanks everyone in advance for any suggestions you may have.<br>\nAmber <br>\n <br>\n<br>\nSent from my iPhone</div>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div><br><br></div> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":343381924,"authorName":"lucy.web","from":"&quot;lucy.web&quot; &lt;lucy.web@...&gt;","profile":"lucylists","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Fostering learning","postDate":"1378585324","msgId":72128,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE0RTI1NERELUFDOUYtNEM0QS1CMENGLUQxNThFRkJDMDdBQkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxOTlGODAyLTI2REEtNDEwNC1CMEJDLTI5Mjk3OEU0NUNDMkBhbWJlcmJvZ2dzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEVFMjQ5RTJFLUY4QUQtNDE3RS1BMzhELTM5NTczRjlCNDMwOUBhbWJlcmJvZ2dzLmNvbT4gPEVGOEIyMkZDLTJERTAtNEFGOC05MjE3LTVGNzc1MTFBOTRDOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDUxOTlGODAyLTI2REEtNDEwNC1CMEJDLTI5Mjk3OEU0NUNDMkBhbWJlcmJvZ2dzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72126,"nextInTopic":72130,"prevInTime":72127,"nextInTime":72129,"topicId":72110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As a family we have very much enjoyed watching David Attenborough Nature dvds from the BBC.

He has done many series over the years, but the more recent series have the more snazzy camera-work, so might be the most visually stunning for your children.   They are not specifically aimed at children, but the narration is clear and concise, and it&#39;s been easy for my children to follow from when they were quite young.  There are sometimes scenes of lions eating gazelle, and suchlike, which may be a concern for some.    Some of the series look in detail at certain species and habitats (insects or oceans, for example) and some of them take a more global perspective and touch on how habitats and species interact with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour example of finding a spider, and then looking it up in a reference book reminded me a lot of how I had assumed our &quot;unschooling&quot; would look, when my children were as young as your children.   It hasn&#39;t turned out like that at all, not for my family.   Saying: &quot;let&#39;s go and look it up&quot; has pretty much always been a turn-off for my children, even though they have never been to school.   My younger daughter would just walk away, my older would sit and listen dutifully, and feign interest, but soon go onto something else of her own choosing.   I think, despite my best intentions and efforts, me reading stuff out from a book to them was just too &#39;teachery&#39;.   I hadn&#39;t yet properly deschooled myself.   I could hear my voice becoming teacher-like even when I was doing it, but I couldn&#39;t seem to help it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger daughter just refused to engage at all, and I think she has emerged fairly unscathed from it, but my older daughter still struggles sometimes with thinking of learning as being something that comes from the outside, something that is done to her.   I wish I could take it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, what works best for us is to explore stuff together on Google, or even better to find videos about it on YouTube or similar.   We also watch a lot of documentary dvds, and listen to a lot of audio books, all together.   I have shelves and shelves full of non-fiction books that never really get browsed or used - I wished I had saved the money!   But both girls devour fiction books quite happily, so it&#39;s not a reading thing … it&#39;s more about the tools they choose to use to get their info.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example my younger daughter thinks there&#39;s a great white shark in our little pop-up swimming pool.   She also has a killer-whale shaped inflatable.   I commented that I thought that the killer whale would scare the shark away and keep her safe.   Later in a quiet moment when we both happened to be at the kitchen table I looked up &quot;Killer whale versus Great White Shark&quot; on my ipod.   We discussed the facts and figures and the sizes of each creature, etc.  Then she asked if there were any videos of a killer whale fighting a great white shark, and we found one on YouTube and watched it together.   Very different from the days when I would - effectively - stop what we were doing so that we could go and look something up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a fab group on Facebook - if you&#39;ve not already found it - called &quot;My unschooler is interested in …&quot;   If one of your children became interested in spiders, for example, you could post about it there, and you would get lots of wonderful replies suggesting fun resources to do with spiders.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":382612893,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;regan@...&gt;","profile":"reganzzzz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"RE: Fostering learning","postDate":"1378581488","msgId":72126,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwwZnU1ZysxZHJuZHM3QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNzg1NjQ4MTguNTYwNDcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjAwMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72120,"nextInTopic":72128,"prevInTime":72125,"nextInTime":72127,"topicId":72110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The iPad app called Toontastic is great for kids who like storytelling.

He has done many series over the years, but the more recent series have the more snazzy camera-work, so might be the most visually stunning for your children.   They are not specifically aimed at children, but the narration is clear and concise, and it&#39;s been easy for my children to follow from when they were quite young.  There are sometimes scenes of lions eating gazelle, and suchlike, which may be a concern for some.    Some of the series look in detail at certain species and habitats (insects or oceans, for example) and some of them take a more global perspective and touch on how habitats and species interact with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour example of finding a spider, and then looking it up in a reference book reminded me a lot of how I had assumed our &quot;unschooling&quot; would look, when my children were as young as your children.   It hasn&#39;t turned out like that at all, not for my family.   Saying: &quot;let&#39;s go and look it up&quot; has pretty much always been a turn-off for my children, even though they have never been to school.   My younger daughter would just walk away, my older would sit and listen dutifully, and feign interest, but soon go onto something else of her own choosing.   I think, despite my best intentions and efforts, me reading stuff out from a book to them was just too &#39;teachery&#39;.   I hadn&#39;t yet properly deschooled myself.   I could hear my voice becoming teacher-like even when I was doing it, but I couldn&#39;t seem to help it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger daughter just refused to engage at all, and I think she has emerged fairly unscathed from it, but my older daughter still struggles sometimes with thinking of learning as being something that comes from the outside, something that is done to her.   I wish I could take it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, what works best for us is to explore stuff together on Google, or even better to find videos about it on YouTube or similar.   We also watch a lot of documentary dvds, and listen to a lot of audio books, all together.   I have shelves and shelves full of non-fiction books that never really get browsed or used - I wished I had saved the money!   But both girls devour fiction books quite happily, so it&#39;s not a reading thing … it&#39;s more about the tools they choose to use to get their info.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example my younger daughter thinks there&#39;s a great white shark in our little pop-up swimming pool.   She also has a killer-whale shaped inflatable.   I commented that I thought that the killer whale would scare the shark away and keep her safe.   Later in a quiet moment when we both happened to be at the kitchen table I looked up &quot;Killer whale versus Great White Shark&quot; on my ipod.   We discussed the facts and figures and the sizes of each creature, etc.  Then she asked if there were any videos of a killer whale fighting a great white shark, and we found one on YouTube and watched it together.   Very different from the days when I would - effectively - stop what we were doing so that we could go and look something up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a fab group on Facebook - if you&#39;ve not already found it - called &quot;My unschooler is interested in …&quot;   If one of your children became interested in spiders, for example, you could post about it there, and you would get lots of wonderful replies suggesting fun resources to do with spiders.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Fostering learning","postDate":"1378558473","msgId":72118,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENGRTNDRjJELUIzRUYtNDVEOS1BMTU4LTUzMzcwNTY5OTg1NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxOTlGODAyLTI2REEtNDEwNC1CMEJDLTI5Mjk3OEU0NUNDMkBhbWJlcmJvZ2dzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEVFMjQ5RTJFLUY4QUQtNDE3RS1BMzhELTM5NTczRjlCNDMwOUBhbWJlcmJvZ2dzLmNvbT4gPEVGOEIyMkZDLTJERTAtNEFGOC05MjE3LTVGNzc1MTFBOTRDOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDUxOTlGODAyLTI2REEtNDEwNC1CMEJDLTI5Mjk3OEU0NUNDMkBhbWJlcmJvZ2dzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72115,"nextInTopic":72120,"prevInTime":72117,"nextInTime":72119,"topicId":72110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What kind of spider he is, what he eats etc. Normal sighted parents would help the child look up information in a dictionary or encyclopedia spider book etc. If the child wanted to read more about the spider they could simply read about the spider to the child.

My children are 5 4  and two.  Smile <br/>\n With that said, I am hoping someone out there might be able to shout some good suggestions my way.<br/>\nI am looking for things activities movies etc. that  I can have around the house  that will help foster my children&#39;s love of learning. Things such as good DVDs about nature, books etc. One hard aspects about finding such things is that me and my husband are both totally blind, so we cannot read a lot of mainstream books and less they are adapted. My son in particular loves learning new things, and when he has activities around he will choose to do the activities that challenge his brain more often than not. Fun  websites that they could visit would also be helpful. They both have their own computers, and with our assistance should be able to do some of the fun website activities that are out there. <br/>\nThey all love movies, and I would love some recommendations on good-quality documentaries etc. for this age group. We love doing crafts together, but I have a very difficult time coming up with craft ideas for them. They do make up their own stuff, but they also like some ideas of things they could make.<br/>\nMy son who is five, has shown an immense interest in writing his own superhero story. We are currently looking for a program an app for their iPods or some other method of helping him write the story, and compose pictures. I know Microsoft word seems like the obvious choice, but due to our vision problems, we are unable to use the clip art that goes along with it.<br/>\nAre there any children&#39;s encyclopedias for the iPod etc. that do not require children to be able to read in order to utilize?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not intend on using any of these activities or tools to force them to utilize them, but we want to have them available if they ask or show interest in using them.<br/>\nI guess I am just having a hard time finding the things I am looking for. I am certain if I were cited this wouldn&#39;t be as difficult, but the vision loss definitely throws a wrench in some of the things I would like to utilize.<br/>\nThanks everyone in advance for any suggestions you may have.<br/>\nAmber <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72076,"nextTopicId":72140}}
