When my sister died suddenly, I went into shock <br/>\nand stayed that way for 6 months.  I cleaned, cooked, and cared for <br/>\nmy family.  I drove my children to lessons and sat quietly.  I was <br/>\npolite and answered direct questions, but that was all.  Many <br/>\nfriends drifted away.  Some told me that I was boring.  Some told me <br/>\nthat I needed to snap out of it.  Some told me that I needed to <br/>\npray.  I was incapable of doing any of those things.  I didn&#39;t care <br/>\nwhat people thought.  Emotionally, I was running on empty and I <br/>\ncould not relate to anyone other than my husband and kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day, the shock lessened enough for me to let the pain in.  I <br/>\nbroke down and cried for days.  After that, I began to arise from my <br/>\nstupor and started to be able to relate to others.  I am sure that <br/>\nsome people watched me for those 6 months and thought that I didn&#39;t <br/>\ncare.  I believe that it was a matter of survival.  I was <br/>\nemotionless for months becasue the pain was more than I could <br/>\nhandle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother handled it differently.  He became a crusader with a <br/>\nvengeance.  He attended every court appearance of the men who killed <br/>\nmy sister.  He used anger to handle his pain.  I think that we both <br/>\ndid what we needed to get through it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that people should judge by appearances.  We are all <br/>\nso complex and we hide most of ourselves deep inside where others <br/>\ncannot see.  I don&#39;t know what Andrea&#39;s husband is really feeling.  <br/>\nI can&#39;t see how anyone else could know either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77438814,"authorName":"Stacy Finch","from":"&quot;Stacy Finch&quot; &lt;finchstacy@...&gt;","profile":"finchstacy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Stages of Grief","postDate":"1016784341","msgId":33265,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzMTRuNFRWVVFtdkpkMlpicXgwMDAxYTRhNUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33309,"prevInTime":33264,"nextInTime":33266,"topicId":33265,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry Paula, but I don t think I would be easily convinced.
