I have this quote sent to me from a <br/>\nstudent that made me crack up.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The most explicit level of learning that takes place as one plays <br/>\na video or computer game is that one is learning how to do <br/>\nsomething. As one plays one learns, gradually or quickly, the <br/>\nmoves of the game Â– how the various characters, pieces, or <br/>\nanything else operate and what you can make them do. One <br/>\nlearns how to drag tiles to build up a virtual city or theme park. <br/>\nOne learns how to virtually fight and protect oneself. One learns <br/>\nhow to train a creature and make it evolve. And of course one <br/>\nlearns the physical manipulations of the controllers involved in <br/>\ndoing all this. &quot;<br/>\nBy Marc Prensky 2002 author of Digital Game-Based Learning <br/>\n(McGraw-Hill) and founder and CEO of Games2Train<br/>\n<br/>\nI love that this quote validates the value of computer gaming as <br/>\nhaving merit *in and of itself* rather than always having to say <br/>\nthat computer gaming is only of value as it relates to other *more <br/>\nesteemed* activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83041,"nextTopicId":83065}}
