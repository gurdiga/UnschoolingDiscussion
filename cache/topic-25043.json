I tried to explain to this <br/>\ngentleman that as far as I was concerned Sean was progressing.  He was happy, <br/>\nwe hadn&#39;t seen any temper tantrums in months, he giggled (hadn&#39;t seen that in <br/>\nyears) and actually came to me for love and affection and liked to spend time <br/>\nwith me... another thing that had been stolen from him by ps!!!  In fact, I can <br/>\nactually say I love being around him and I even &quot;like&quot; him now.... please tell <br/>\nme you understand that feeling....<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s not progression, what is?????????  Anyway, he got on his high horse <br/>\nabout how important tests are and because my two older kids have done great in <br/>\nthe ps system I know how important they are as well...... yada, yada, yada.  I <br/>\ntried to explain that Sean wasn&#39;t Nick and Shevaun and to expect him to have <br/>\nthe same needs or desires was just not fair.   I know I lost that one, and i <br/>\nwant to be prepared the next time... can someone help me, please?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be a good response to the testing question???  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for the input.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanmarie - with a happy 14 yo and loving every minute of it!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************<br/>\nGet your free E-Mail and Homepage<br/>\nGo to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.networld.com\">http://www.networld.com</a><br/>\n*********************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25319,"nextTopicId":25337}}
