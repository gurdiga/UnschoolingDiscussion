I think you can compare it to the way kids learn to read.<br/>\nThey see us reading for pleasure and for information.   We read to them<br/>\nwhen they want us to.   We make sure we provide lots of reading materials<br/>\nfor them to mess around with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if they see us taking care of our homes for pleasure ( because a<br/>\nclean kitchen is more peaceful than a messy one)  and for necessity. ( we<br/>\nneed clean clothes)   What if we do things for them, pick up toys, find<br/>\nmissing shoes, etc.   What if we let them help when they&#39;re little and<br/>\ninterested, letting them do just as much as they want and not expecting<br/>\nmore?<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it really the same?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a kid would be pretty stupid to jump up and clean joyously if a<br/>\nparent has made it well known that cleaning is an unpleasant and<br/>\nmiserable chore.    I think, however hard it might be, we need to do<br/>\nthings for our family happily if we hope for them to do things happily<br/>\nfor us.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a perfect house keeper.  I let a lot of things wait.   But when I<br/>\nclean I try to be pleasant about it, to think of it as a benefit to my<br/>\nfamily and not as a hardship for me.   If I really hate a thing and can&#39;t<br/>\ndo it happily I wait until everyone&#39;s outside or at the store somewhere<br/>\nand do it then and grumble if I have to.   I wouldn&#39;t ever expect my kid<br/>\nto be happily willing to do some job I was forever bitching about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you shouldn&#39;t eat off my floor, and I almost always have cob webs<br/>\nsomewhere or other, but I also have a child who will take the garbage out<br/>\nwhen he notices it&#39;s full and sometimes does dishes just because they&#39;re<br/>\nthere.   I think that&#39;s better than a perfectly clean house with a kid<br/>\nwho has assigned chores.   Yes, there is a world of possibilities between<br/>\nthose two scenarios, but this one fits easily with my other thoughts on<br/>\nunschooling.   For the same reasons I don&#39;t assign reading or math I<br/>\ndon&#39;t assign dishes or laundry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know not everyone agrees on this.  The truth is kids who have reading<br/>\nlessons mostly do learn how to read.  Kids who have math lessons do learn<br/>\nhow to add and subtract.   Kids who are made to do chores do know how to<br/>\nwash toilets and mop.    It comes down to which is the natural way for<br/>\nkids to learn and grow.<br/>\nIf you happen to think natural learning is healthier it seems only<br/>\nreasonable to look at all of life as natural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, out of wine and off to watch a movie.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56835,"nextTopicId":56877}}
