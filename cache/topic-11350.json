I did this for a bee<br/>\nsting I had on he end of my second toe and the pain<br/>\nand itching went away and never came back. I also did<br/>\nthis for my kids when they would get ant bites. One<br/>\ntime we at my neighbors and the kids were all rolling<br/>\nin the grass. One of mine rolled into an ant bed and<br/>\nwas covered with ants. They were in her hair, shirt,<br/>\npants everywhere. She was screaming. After we got the<br/>\nants off her I made the tobacco tea and put it on her<br/>\nand they didn&#39;t bother her much after that. Also, I<br/>\nwould recamend Avino oatmeal bath.
