I met my husband in <br/>\nEngland while I was on vacation (a British person, now American on vacation <br/>\nin England)!!  I went there to be with my best friend.  I&#39;d been there the <br/>\nyear before to be in her wedding.  5 months after she was married Jeremy (her <br/>\nhusband) was killed in an accident.  As I wasn&#39;t married at the time and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any kids I quit my job, gave up my apartment, stored all my <br/>\nbelongings and took off to England for 3 months to be with her.  3 weeks <br/>\nafter I was there I met Steve (now hubbie) at an airforce base my mother met <br/>\nmy step-father at 19 years before.  Steve and I married 4 months after we met <br/>\nand from the moment we met until it was exactly 5 months to the day that Roz <br/>\nwould have been married to Jeremy I was petrified that Steve would die.  On <br/>\nthe day that was exactly from the time Roz and Jeremy were married to the <br/>\ntime of his death Steve was going to another base for the day.  It was <br/>\npouring with rain (usual for England) and I was so scared that he was going <br/>\nto be killed on that day in an accident that I begged him not to go.  I got <br/>\nphysically sick and ended up taking the day off work and spend it with Steve. <br/>\n I still have those feelings quite a lot, probably because of my experience <br/>\nwith Roz and her husband.
