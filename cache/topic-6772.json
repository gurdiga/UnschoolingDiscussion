My son<br/>\nloved his classes and really shone on stage but felt alienated as the<br/>\nonly boy at his school, and I have to say alot of the other students&#39;<br/>\nmothers did nothing to help the situation.  Before he becomes totally<br/>\ndisenchanted I&#39;m hoping he can have contact with someone who could help<br/>\nencourage him.  I have always firmly believed the world would be a<br/>\nbetter place if ALL boys took Ballet lessons!  The fact that his father<br/>\nwas a dancer is of only minor consolation.  Can anyone help?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\nWinifred Haun + Dancers wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Winifred Haun + Dancers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wini@...\">wini@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cindy: The things to look for in a dance teacher are kind of the same for<br/>\n&gt; other areas: you want a kind person who&#39;s not too military with the kids.<br/>\n&gt; As for a studio and approach, etc., 3 years old is really way too young<br/>\n&gt; for ballet classes.
