Certainly, <br/>\nit&#39;s not as strict as PA, but I thought it was pretty darn strict when I <br/>\nmoved here from New Mexico!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy state guidelines require me to undergo a portfolio review no more than 3 <br/>\ntimes per year. In my county, this means that I meet with a certified <br/>\nteacher twice a year, once at the end of each semester. They have a form <br/>\nthat I fill out regarding the curriculum I offer for each subject <br/>\narea.  This has been pretty easy, but my kids are still young--my oldest is <br/>\n1st grade this year.  There&#39;s not a whole lot of space under each heading, <br/>\nso I usually list whatever books we have, topics we&#39;ve talked about, movies <br/>\nwe&#39;ve seen, trips we&#39;ve taken that apply to whatever subject heading. <br/>\nSometimes I list the same thing for more than one subject if it applies in <br/>\nschool terms. I also take in a list of books we&#39;ve taken out of the <br/>\nlibrary, bought and read. Many schools offer online versions of their <br/>\ncurriculum (mine do), so it&#39;s pretty easy to just parrot that back at them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s annoying to have to meet with someone twice a year, but all in all the <br/>\nportfolio system isn&#39;t too bad. It occurs after the fact, which makes it <br/>\npretty easy to say what we&#39;ve done. It presents examples of work done <br/>\nrather than a total of work done, so I don&#39;t have to show that we do <br/>\nanything every day (or even on a regular basis, for that matter).  My <br/>\nreviews also take place face to face, which allows me to explain and expand <br/>\non lots of our activities, so my reviewer knows that we do stuff even if I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have worksheets to prove it. No testing is key, I have to say. I&#39;m <br/>\nusually able to just ignore the whole review issue until about a week <br/>\nbefore it actually happens; then, I just begin translating all the stuff <br/>\nwe&#39;ve done into terms the schools would be comfortable with, you know?  For <br/>\nexample, &quot;mama built (greatly expanded a dinky little one that was here <br/>\nwhen we moved in) a really cool pond in the backyard with neat fish, frogs <br/>\nand turtles&quot; will become &quot;Designed, constructed and maintained an aquatic <br/>\necosystem capable of supporting the life cycles of numerous species, <br/>\nincluding fish, frogs and dragon flies.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a really great reviewer, which can make all the difference. I&#39;m <br/>\nprobably going to continue reviewing with the county until they begin to <br/>\ngive me grief. Then, I have the option of joining an umbrella organization, <br/>\nwhich still requires reviews but can have different and more relaxed <br/>\nagendas, depending upon who they are. If they weren&#39;t so expensive, I might <br/>\njoin one sooner rather than later just to avoid the whole county review <br/>\nprocess and the stress that goes along with it.  Although I don&#39;t stress <br/>\ntoo much over the whole thing, I do find myself thinking in more <br/>\ntraditional terms whenever the thoughts of review enter my head--something <br/>\nI&#39;d like to do away with entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle, who is curiously and a bit apprehensively watching for changes <br/>\nin the process as her children get older</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153743844,"authorName":"tjreynoso","from":"&quot;tjreynoso&quot; &lt;tjreynoso@...&gt;","profile":"tjreynoso","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"postDate":"1071083322","msgId":86057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJyN3F2cStvaWk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":86085,"prevInTime":86056,"nextInTime":86058,"topicId":86057,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m not sure if my first attempt went thru but here i go again....
