Makes me not want to do it and makes things<br/>\n&gt; feel like I&#39;m being <br/>\n&gt; ordered around and everything done that way feels like<br/>\n&gt; an obligation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just some insight I had - don&#39;t know what to do with<br/>\n&gt; it, yet.

I<br/>\n&gt; seem so sensitive <br/>\n&gt; to this, and so often feel myself being &quot;contrary&quot; - I<br/>\n&gt; suspect it was <br/>\n&gt; commonly done to me in my childhood.

But in this sickly sweet, nice<br/>\n&gt; as can be, tone of voice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;You can&#39;t do that, here let me do that for you.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; Or a similar refrain.  I swear to god I thought I was<br/>\n&gt; going to explode by the fifth or sixth time.  It<br/>\n&gt; seemed synchronicity by then, btw, I mean what are the<br/>\n&gt; odds, every time I was up there, there she was?  I<br/>\n&gt; digress.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course by then there was a total melt down.  That<br/>\n&gt; kid was screaming from frustration.  I could see it<br/>\n&gt; clearly, because I had been thru that, had done that<br/>\n&gt; for a while until I saw the error of my ways.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She thought she was being a &quot;good mother&quot;.  I would<br/>\n&gt; even hazard a guess that she thought she was being a<br/>\n&gt; fantastic mother, jumping up and down the entire time<br/>\n&gt; to do this or that for her child(ren).  She probably<br/>\n&gt; has no clue.  And I had no idea what to do or say. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I did that, my mother did that, she&#39;s doing that,<br/>\n&gt; maybe her mother did that, maybe her mother was an<br/>\n&gt; abusive heartless ignoring type mother and she&#39;s doing<br/>\n&gt; the exact opposite, I have no idea. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *sigh*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know why I shared this story, really, I have<br/>\n&gt; no solution to this particular situation.

That<br/>\nkid was screaming from frustration.  I could see it<br/>\nclearly, because I had been thru that, had done that<br/>\nfor a while until I saw the error of my ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe thought she was being a &quot;good mother&quot;.  I would<br/>\neven hazard a guess that she thought she was being a<br/>\nfantastic mother, jumping up and down the entire time<br/>\nto do this or that for her child(ren).  She probably<br/>\nhas no clue.  And I had no idea what to do or say. <br/>\n<br/>\n I did that, my mother did that, she&#39;s doing that,<br/>\nmaybe her mother did that, maybe her mother was an<br/>\nabusive heartless ignoring type mother and she&#39;s doing<br/>\nthe exact opposite, I have no idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why I shared this story, really, I have<br/>\nno solution to this particular situation.

It ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2091721906\">My next post.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read just a few pages of a book that I think was recommended by <br/>\nsomeone here. And it has already really given me some major insight. It <br/>\ntalks about how much we usually don&#39;t like it when somebody tells us to <br/>\ndo something we were just about to do. For example, we spill something <br/>\nand we&#39;re reaching for some paper towels to clean it up and our spouse <br/>\nor parent says, &quot;Use those paper towels to clean that up.&quot; Makes many <br/>\nof us NOT want to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell - the author of this book talks about how some people have the <br/>\nsame reaction to things we tell ourselves to do. This rings very true <br/>\nto me. For example, I look at the dirty dishes and I&#39;m really planning <br/>\nto wash them, and I say to myself, &quot;You should wash those, get them <br/>\ndone now, they&#39;ll just be harder to do later, now don&#39;t procrastinate.&quot; <br/>\n  My response to MySELF is really similar to my reaction to somebody <br/>\nelse telling me to clean up the dishes when I was just about to do that <br/>\nanyway. Makes me not want to do it and makes things feel like I&#39;m being <br/>\nordered around and everything done that way feels like an obligation.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some insight I had - don&#39;t know what to do with it, yet. But I <br/>\nthought it was interesting to think about how often we might be telling <br/>\nour kids to do things they&#39;d have done anyway, too. I seem so sensitive <br/>\nto this, and so often feel myself being &quot;contrary&quot; - I suspect it was <br/>\ncommonly done to me in my childhood.
