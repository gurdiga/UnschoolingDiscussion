I found that the minister is <br/>\nan athiest.  Most of the impressions I had about UU was that they are <br/>\nopen to exploring many beliefs regarding spirituality, but my <br/>\nunderstanding of atheism is that basically they believe there is NO <br/>\ngod, so I don&#39;t quite get how you have spirituality without any form <br/>\nof deity, whether it be god, goddess, buddha, etc.  Am I missing <br/>\nsomething here?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also seemed that there was a huge democratic &quot;slant&quot; in the <br/>\nsermons shown on the website.

Our service is very churchy but not very churchy if that makes<br/>\nany sense. There are readings (but they can be from anything...poems, UU ministers,<br/>\nthe bible, novels...), hymns (some are even tunes that I knew from my episcopalian<br/>\nupbringing but with different words), there is a sermon but it is not preachy<br/>\nrather it just gives you interesting things to think about. We do have lay led<br/>\nservices and have speakers sometimes come in. Topics are great including environmentalism,<br/>\nwar, peace, etc. There is also music ranging from a sax quartet to a piano playing<br/>\nshow tunes. They celebrate easter, christmas, passover, winter/summer solstices (we<br/>\nhave a great outdoor wooded circle...there is a stream that runs through the church<br/>\nproperty and we own a lot of land that we keep mostly in its natural state). I loved<br/>\nthat a couple of weeks ago my 3 yo had a seder in his RE class and then went and<br/>\njoined another class to decorate easter eggs. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that I like the ritual in the service and that I really enjoy the topics<br/>\ndiscussed. And the community with like minded people is great. I got to talk with<br/>\none of the church founders at the visioning weekend (our church is only 22 years old)<br/>\nand it was really neat to hear about how it started.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: UU church  was: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling and Life","postDate":"1051821064","msgId":67221,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBRDZGQzQ4LjE4MUIxJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU1LjNlY2RkMDdhLjJiZTJjNDQxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67184,"nextInTopic":67312,"prevInTime":67220,"nextInTime":67222,"topicId":67177,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
