My folks<br/>\nalways said cow&#39;s milk is for baby cows, not baby people.  We<br/>\nwere nursed for about a year and after that liquids were free<br/>\nrein.  My accommodating father, a doc, sent in a &quot;milk allergy&quot;<br/>\nnote.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side when our 24 y.o. was a toddler we had to use day<br/>\ncare for a while.  I didn&#39;t know that he was intolerant of milk,<br/>\nbecause he had never had cow&#39;s milk.  It actually took about 3<br/>\nexplosive episodes before I made the connection.  It was hard to<br/>\nmake the folks there believe me, but the &quot;both ends, with vigor&quot;<br/>\nresponse was triggered within about an hour of drinking milk, so<br/>\nany attempt to test Mom&#39;s opinion was promptly revealed and<br/>\nalmost as unpleasant for the day care as for the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 19, 2003 9:13 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: sugar bad or not? or the<br/>\nlies are parents told us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| In a message dated 1/19/2003 9:54:57 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n|<br/>\n| It&#39;s not a question of whether allergies actually exist.
