Both then and now. I think you just get <br/>\nto a point where you decide even though you are willing to accept such <br/>\ntreatment, you  will not allow it to happen to your own child, in any manner, degree <br/>\nor otherwise. My father has never laid a hand on me, yet the damage he <br/>\ninflicted on me and more so on my siblings, is almost immeasurable. Because no-one <br/>\ncan see the damage and so much is internalized, it wasn&#39;t until I was an adult <br/>\nwith a family of my own, away from my fathers clutches, that I discovered I <br/>\ncould live without him. Even as a newlywed, we lived down the street. After the <br/>\ntwins were born, we moved into the house across the street. As my DH started to <br/>\nsee that all our decisions were being made with my fathers influence, he <br/>\nobjected. I gave in a little, but just a little! We moved a mile away.LOL A year <br/>\nlater we moved an hour away. Slowly we broke free and my DH was ever so careful <br/>\nabout it. I love him for that alone when I sit and think about that. A lesser <br/>\nman would probably just said, that&#39;s it, we&#39;re not living this way. <br/>\nUltimately he did say enough was enough, but he truly supported me throughout the whole <br/>\nheartbreaking process. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad discussing the manipulation factor helped you. I didn&#39;t know I had <br/>\nso much to say about it. Funny how you start talking about one thing and <br/>\narrive to another. But I&#39;m pretty sure the steps you all made today were huge and <br/>\nwhen everyone lays their head down tonite, everyone will contemplate what <br/>\nChristopher had to say and the loving way in which he said it. That says so much <br/>\nfor you as parents and also will require the grandparents to self reflect. I <br/>\nthink this was a great start on your road to happiness without manipulation. And <br/>\nas far as your own mother goes, perhaps her hurtful words today were actually <br/>\nmore about herself than you.

Your <br/>\nadvice and personal stories helped us tremendously especially Christopher. He read <br/>\nevery one of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to visit my parents and DH parents today for Father&#39;s Day. DH parents <br/>\nwere just plain cold towards us barely saying a word but we just kept on <br/>\nsmiling! My parents were very quiet but I knew that wouldn&#39;t last long.<br/>\nAt one point, my mother went on one of her ranting modes and to our surprise <br/>\nit was Christopher that spoke up and said his peace! A bit of a surprise. <br/>\nChristopher&#39;s very talkative in the last year but still needed to come out of that <br/>\nshell of expressing himself without anger and bitterness. He put us in tears! <br/>\nHe was honest and kind with his words when he told his grandparents this: <br/>\nGrandma, try not to think of yourself so much when it comes to OUR lives. I love <br/>\nyou guys so much but you are being selfish. Grandpa says to Christopher: how <br/>\nso son? Christopher said because grandpa, when you are not selfish you find hap<br/>\npiness in what makes your kids happy. I am happy with my family and I will be <br/>\nhappy in New Hampshire. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy now grandma breaks out in yet another rant of: see what you&#39;ve done with <br/>\nthis kid? This is the first time I can honestly say Kimberly that you have <br/>\nalways been such a good (now I know where I got that nasty habit)! mother that I <br/>\nam disappointed in you and the way you are letting this kid go wild. Blah, <br/>\nblah, blah. I am so glad I am not my mother anymore!!!! Wild? From speaking his <br/>\nmind in a very calm and sweet voice? I calmly explained to her that with those <br/>\nwords she not only insulted me as his mother but insulted him as her grandchild <br/>\nand makes herself look foolish. What kind of close relationship is that? I <br/>\nexplained to her that we have changed and that we don&#39;t want to live life for <br/>\nanyone else but ourselves. Nobody dictates our life to us anymore, time to <br/>\nlighten up, relax and enjoy what we have and we are going with or without their <br/>\nblessings. <br/>\n<br/>\nDad, who is really my step dad accepted this but said he was not happy we are <br/>\nmoving and that is okay with us. Mom on the other hand left the room and did <br/>\nnot return even when we were leaving.

I guess we sort of let them know that they can be stiff and <br/>\nmaterialistic all they want but we choose not to anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent the rest of the day packing boxes and blasting music and singing as <br/>\nloud as we could. Usually we are quiet for our snooty neighbors. What a good <br/>\ntime we had regardless of what has happened. Even DH was singing which was a <br/>\nfirst. And Christopher, well he is just so happy.

I do want to add something though. <br/>\nWhen I read your post last nite, I was on a posting rampage, but stopped <br/>\nmyself because I felt your dilemma was worthy of longer contemplation. I have a <br/>\ntendancy to jump the gun and get confrontational sometimes, especially when my <br/>\nfamily is being hurt. My blood was boiling as I read your post. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think more than anything else, it was the blantant disregard for your <br/>\nmarriage and your parenting and boils down to manipulation. I have been on this <br/>\nroad since I kicked my own father out of my home and my life just over 4 years <br/>\nago. You see manipulation as I know it now, is a two way street. In that, I mean <br/>\nthat people always talk about manipulators, but never the manipulated. <br/>\nManipulation only works when two parties are playing the game. I thought I was not <br/>\nan easily manipulated person in all aspects of my life. I was a rebel to the <br/>\ncore as far as the way stuff &quot;should&quot; be done and the way I did my own thing. <br/>\nThat is, except where my father was concerned. My mom used to tell me that my <br/>\ndad was a great manipulator, and that she worried about how much he could <br/>\nmanipulate me and I was blind to it. Unfortunately, for 29 years I was more blind <br/>\nthan I really even want to admit. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut when I opened my eyes to the pain he so easily afflicted on others, <br/>\nespecially his children and parents, I stepped back and realized I didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nplay the game anymore. I didn&#39;t want my kids to learn the game. I hated that my <br/>\nsiblings were stuck in the game because they were still minors. And when the <br/>\nchips came tumbling down, I hated the fact that he had taught me from an early <br/>\nage to play the manipulation game and I hated him for it. The more my sight <br/>\ncame back, the more I realized, I couldn&#39;t come up with a single positive thing <br/>\nI liked about him. It was a horrible time in my life, but once I had all <br/>\nthese realizations, my own world started to make sense again.  The day he left my <br/>\nhome was the first day of my life that I knew I would never again be <br/>\nmanipulated, especially with something as important as love. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou see that was his weapon of mass destruction...If you love me...you&#39;ll lie <br/>\nfor me, if you love me...you&#39;ll pick me over your mom, if you love <br/>\nme...you&#39;ll live where I want you to, if you love me...you&#39;ll yada, yada, yada. Yet <br/>\ndoing all these things were never enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband had had enough when my health was on a really bad road in 1996 and <br/>\nall the surgeries were happening, one after another, then the near death <br/>\nthing and my dad never showed up once. No call, no card, no is she gonna live? <br/>\nEven after that, I still stayed in the game mode though. My DH couldn&#39;t forgive <br/>\nhim, but I could. He was my daddy. Three years later his own life fell apart <br/>\nand who&#39;s door did he come knocking on? Shockingly, my DH said, &quot;He has to stay, <br/>\nRhonda, he has no where else to go.&quot; I knew then that letting him and 3 of my <br/>\n7 siblings move in could risk everything we had built, but Phil loved me <br/>\nenough to sacrifice his own feelings and try. Needless to say it didn&#39;t work. But <br/>\njust like being sick can make you see stuff you never realized before, so can <br/>\nthese parents issues. For as horrible as it all went down, it was the only way <br/>\nI was gonna really open my eyes, and realize I have the power to not let <br/>\nanyone manipulate me, not even my parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as sad as it is, and yes, it is in fact sad, your parents and your DH&#39;s <br/>\nparents, have chosen to use your families love against you. They are using it to <br/>\nmanipulate you, your hubby, and the worst of all, your child. I say, DON&quot;T <br/>\nplay the game. They have the choice to be mean and hateful or loving and kind, <br/>\neither way it&#39;s their choice. As far as your son goes, I think a discussion of <br/>\nwhat qualifies as sacrifice based on love vs. manipulation based on love maybe <br/>\nin order. If they had 3 months to live and there was no doubt that they would <br/>\nlive past that time frame, that may be a sacrifice, where you love them <br/>\nenough to postpone your own stuff. But to simply be throwing tantrums and pulling <br/>\nthat crap with your kid about not speaking to him, because your choices don&#39;t <br/>\nagree with theirs, therefore you must not love them, well I&#39;d say they are all <br/>\nfull of shit. By the fact that your son is in tears over the things they <br/>\nthreaten, would have me moving sooner than July. Figuratively of course. In other <br/>\nwords, I&#39;d tell them you&#39;re leaving and you hope to have their best wishes, but <br/>\nif they are too selfish to give you even just that much, are they even worth <br/>\none more tear? Especially the tears of your child? We are adults who can make <br/>\nchoices based on our experiences, but your son is watching all of this playing <br/>\nout, what is it that you want him to learn?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, it seems I have still ranted, but I guess like always I had a lot to <br/>\nsay. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps, good luck and best wishes!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - father free, but much happier<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Advice Needed Please, Sandra & Others..Long","postDate":"1055633505","msgId":74194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOGQwMWMzMzJjZCQxZWI3Mjc3MCQ2NTAxYThjMEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDE3Yy4xYzY1Mjc0Yy4yYzFjMGY1YUBhb2wuY29tPiA8M0VFQjQyMEEuN0M2MkExNDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":74192,"nextInTopic":74217,"prevInTime":74193,"nextInTime":74195,"topicId":74136,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"wow - I love this post!! ...

I could really use some advice before I move on and loose <br/>\nmy cool with my family. Please excuse my way of writing, as you all know I am <br/>\nnot good with words. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always been the type of parents that procrastinate. We&#39;ll do it next <br/>\nyear, someday, maybe tomorrow and so on. Since we&#39;ve joined this list we now <br/>\nhave the attitude with ourselves and Christopher that there is no tomorrow, lets <br/>\ndo it now! Life is to short! <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the problem: My parents whom we are extremely close to, think we are <br/>\nruining Christopher by unschooling him and that my husband and I are just <br/>\ncrazy. Christopher wanted all his hair shaved off and he got what he wanted and my <br/>\nparents had a fit. I wanted to get some tattoo&#39;s, always have, I had them <br/>\ndone and now I am a freak. They&#39;ve bucked us right down to television, video <br/>\ngames, bed time and anything else under the sun. I guess our change in 6 months is <br/>\ntoo much for them to swallow and I can understand that but it is getting to <br/>\nbe too much. <br/>\nThe big one hit Friday when we told them we are moving to New Hampshire by <br/>\nthe end of July. Now they won&#39;t talk to us! I know it must be hard for them as <br/>\nwe have never lived out of state but they know we&#39;ve been building on our land <br/>\nfor 3 years and we&#39;ve been saying someday, someday, someday. We&#39;re tired of <br/>\nsaying someday. We all want to go so badly, especially Christopher. With Kevin <br/>\nbeing laid off from the airport for the last 6 months and the cabin almost <br/>\ndone, it&#39;s the perfect time. I hate to see my parents cry and I don&#39;t want them to <br/>\nbe mad but we just can&#39;t say okay maybe next year, that is the same thing we <br/>\nkept on saying with our son in regard to homeschooling. Maybe next year. Big <br/>\nMistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second problem comes with my husbands parents. They left Kevin behind to <br/>\nlive on his own since 16 years old. 2 years ago they moved back from out of <br/>\nthe country to our state. Last year, they were both diagnosed with a terminal <br/>\nillness. They are stubborn, live on their own and don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s help. They <br/>\nare very mad that we are leaving. We&#39;re only going to be 3 1/2 hours away <br/>\nfrom them, compared to the 1 1/2 hours we are now. Not too bad. They said they <br/>\ncame home to live close to their son and now we are leaving and if that weren&#39;t <br/>\nbad enough we are ruining their grandson by unschooling him. He talks too much <br/>\nnow. I can&#39;t believe that bs! They&#39;ll never speak to us again if we go. The <br/>\nway I look at it is Kevin is 44 now and Christopher will be 14. We are not <br/>\ngetting any younger. Christopher has been wanting to live there (on our land) <br/>\nsince he was 5 years old. He wants to do it before he&#39;s not a kid anymore. Kevin&#39;s <br/>\nparents wanted their freedom to go off on their own, now we want ours. This <br/>\nis the first time all 3 of us have been so happy and content with life and <br/>\nmoving there would make us all so much happier. We feel for them of course but to <br/>\nstay till they die? They said we could just wait for that to happen. I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike that thought.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve told them over and over that we&#39;ll write, we&#39;ll visit and call them as <br/>\noften as we can. We&#39;ve reassured them all that we will be just fine out there <br/>\nin the woods. We want to go, go, go! All the brothers and sisters though are <br/>\nvery happy for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that enough or are we being selfish? Any thoughts? Sandra, what&#39;s your <br/>\nthoughts?<br/>\nHow can we handle this without leaving on bad terms? There I go with the word <br/>\nbad, you know what I mean. Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful <br/>\nrelationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either and <br/>\nhe&#39;s in tears. I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this! Okay, I&#39;m going to <br/>\nbreath now.
