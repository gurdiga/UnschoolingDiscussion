It&#39;s as if the code is finally<br/>\n&gt; broken and you&#39;re seeing the words on the page for what they really are.<br/>\n&gt; Mine came while I was reading a Family Circus comic strip.  Thelma (Mom)<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; standing in the bathtub holding a part for the plumber, who is working on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; faucet.  Dolly comes in and says, &quot;That was [so and so] on the phone.  I<br/>\ntold<br/>\n&gt; her you couldn&#39;t talk right now because you are in the bathtub with the<br/>\n&gt; plumber.&quot;  I sounded it out, then again, and suddenly I could just READ<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; whole thing without sounding it out at all!   I just looked at all the<br/>\nwords<br/>\n&gt; on the page at once, and they stood on their own, as if they had come to<br/>\n&gt; life.  I was 4 at the time, I think.  We were on vacation in Kansas City,<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; a hotel with a pool on the roof, and my sister threw up in the hallway on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; way back to our room after dinner that night.  She&#39;d had fish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone else share their reading epiphany?  I&#39;m still waiting for that<br/>\n&gt; moment in my younger son.  Last night I bought him a look-and-find book<br/>\n(like<br/>\n&gt; Where&#39;s Waldo) without picture clues.  It only has written clues.  He<br/>\n&gt; LOOOOOOVES look-and-finds, so I think he just might do it.  I didn&#39;t make<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; production of it, just handed him the book and said &quot;Here, I thought you<br/>\n&gt; might like this&quot;.  He opened it up and when he saw that the clues were<br/>\n&gt; written his forehead kinda wrinkled up and he took a quick, secret glance<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; me to see what I was going to do.  I pretended I didn&#39;t notice and kept<br/>\n&gt; unloading my shopping bags.  He didn&#39;t say a word.  He left the book on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; table, but when I got up this morning I found it peeking out from under<br/>\nhis<br/>\n&gt; pillow.
