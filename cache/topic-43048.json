It&#39;s when we do it more <br/>\nand more without realizing what it does to the chld that it becomes a <br/>\nproblem. I&#39;m not sure if it has to do with how we were raised or what. I <br/>\nknow my husband had a habit of promising or saying later tot he kids with <br/>\nall the best intentions, but something would come up to make it not so. I <br/>\npointed it out to him and even still have to remind him sometimes. He wasn&#39;t <br/>\neven realizing what was going on. He would also have a habit of saying if <br/>\nyou do this than this will happen and not follow through. The kids got wise <br/>\nto that quick and he learned his own lesson on that one!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had a crappy childhood with no one really caring so maybe that had <br/>\nsomething to do with it.
