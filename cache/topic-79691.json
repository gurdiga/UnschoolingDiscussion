It used to be that an excused absence didn&#39;t keep the school from getting money from the state for that absent student, but they changed that a few years ago and now the state only gives money based on the number of students actually in attendance - excused or unexcused doesn&#39;t matter - if they aren&#39;t there, they cost there the school doesn&#39;t get money for them from the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - the principals used to tell the parents to lie if they went to Disneyland - give some acceptable excuse so the school would still get their attendance money. But now they don&#39;t get the money anyway - whether the absence is excused or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way - excused absence means the teachers are required to allow the child to make up work - can&#39;t give them zero on a missed exam, for example. An unexcused absense means the teacher is not supposed to allow the child to make up missed work and the child receives a zero on anything they missed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65837075,"authorName":"Shannon","from":"&quot;Shannon&quot; &lt;davenshan@...&gt;","profile":"shan_who","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] $40 days off","postDate":"1062539073","msgId":79770,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhFRUVKSFBHQ0tQRkdQTUVMTk9ER0VMT0RMQUEuZGF2ZW5zaGFuQG1pbmRzcHJpbmcuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzNzE3NSQ2Y2YyZjU0MCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+"},"prevInTopic":79764,"nextInTopic":79773,"prevInTime":79769,"nextInTime":79771,"topicId":79691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Robyn Coburn [mailto:dezigna@comcast.net] Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2003 10:13 AM To: UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com Subject: RE:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-673210335\">Robyn Coburn [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 02, 2003 10:13 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] $40 days off<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The thing for the little ones is the Bug&#39;s Land in California Adventure.<br/>\n&gt;It is really designed for toddlers and small children, more so than Toon<br/>\n&gt;Town.
