Did anything get resolved with the <br/>\nteacher, or did you just let it go? <br/>\nI have been thinking about this the past few days and I wonder if you <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t ask to have your son moved into a group with more involvement in the <br/>\nlesson? Who says he has to be in the 9 year old class? Why, if he is <br/>\ninterested in the lesson and learning, can&#39;t he go to the teen class or with <br/>\nyou to an adult class? This is the bible we are talking about, (I assume) the <br/>\nmaterial covered in another class surely can&#39;t be inappropriate for a child <br/>\nhis age. If you are a fairly religious family, and your faith is a <br/>\ncornerstone in your lives then I assume at 9 your son has the basics down. <br/>\nMaybe he is ready to be in a class that covers more in-depth bible studies. <br/>\nThe teen class might resent a 9 year old in their midst, and the adult class <br/>\nmay too, but who knows? If your little boy is ready for more intense study <br/>\nthen why not? Besides, a child may ask questions that although the adults may <br/>\nwant to ask, they won&#39;t. It could prove to be interesting! Good luck!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38929,"nextTopicId":39065}}
