My main goal in unschooling is to protect my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s passion for learning.  Mine died for a period while being<br/>\nschooled and it awakened slowly when I began college.  I never finished<br/>\ncollege (no degree) but I gave myself the permission to stay a student<br/>\nfor the rest of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want my children to be curious and in charge of their learning for<br/>\ntheir entire lives.
