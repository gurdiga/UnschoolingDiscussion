Although<br/>\nsometimes I can sneak in something I do &quot;what&quot; them to<br/>\nknow! For example we watched the movie &quot;a Mother&#39;s<br/>\nGift&quot; last night. It is based on the book &quot;A lantern<br/>\nin her hand&quot; {please don&#39;t quote that book title as I<br/>\nam only half sure it is correct!} Anyway yesterday<br/>\nafternoon my DD&#39;s made mail boxes for their rooms so<br/>\nthey could write letters to me and each other, so in<br/>\nthe letters I wrote them ,I suggested we write to each<br/>\nother as if we were living in the 1860&#39;s just prior to<br/>\nthe Civil War. They were all for it. And I know my<br/>\nDD&#39;s, they will want me to make costumes for them to<br/>\nwear and we will research the food to cook and so<br/>\non.This may last a week or a month who knows? But they<br/>\nwill come out of this experience knowing a little more<br/>\nthen they did.  <br/>\nJill<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BandLHaney@...\">BandLHaney@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 3/29/00 6:46:47 PM Central<br/>\n&gt; Standard Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shannon@...\">shannon@...</a> <br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  He wasn&#39;t too psyched, and it felt a bit like me<br/>\n&gt; imposing on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  his learning.

I&#39;m keeping the books layed<br/>\n&gt; out on the table and maybe, <br/>\n&gt; in his time, he will look it up but maybe not. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; just not going to worry <br/>\n&gt; about it.
