You don&#39;t have to make learning fun, <br/>\n&gt; learning IS<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fun.  If you had the flu for 2 days and lay on the sofa just <br/>\n&gt; watching<br/>\n&gt; them,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they would still learn.  They&#39;ve learned how to walk and <br/>\n&gt; talk.  You didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sit down and try to teach them that, did you?  I sure hope <br/>\n&gt; not!  But you<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; did<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; cheer their efforts, and talk with them and around them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Forget structure when they reach 6 or 7.  Forget structure <br/>\n&gt; forever.<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; do different things at 6 or 7, different than at 4, different <br/>\n&gt; than at 16.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But you don&#39;t need structure to do that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Think about the things you enjoy doing, and how you&#39;d like <br/>\n&gt; your friends to<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; encourage you to try their favorite things.  You might like <br/>\n&gt; them to point<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; out that they saw a lecture at the public library on Peace in <br/>\n&gt; the Middle<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; East, if they knew you were interested in that sort of thing. <br/>\n&gt; You<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; definitely would NOT want them to sign you up and make you go <br/>\n&gt; to it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And if your best friend loves art, maybe she&#39;d try to get you <br/>\n&gt; to accompany<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; her to the opening of a new show at her favorite gallery.  <br/>\n&gt; But she<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; announce that you had to come, like it or not, because it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; good for you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Treat your kids with the same respect.

Leave them lying around where <br/>\n&gt; they can flip<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; through and look at the pictures.

Get<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; out<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the craft supplies and start making things.  Maybe they&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; join you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they won&#39;t.

You don&#39;t have to make learning fun, learning IS<br/>\nfun.  If you had the flu for 2 days and lay on the sofa just watching them,<br/>\nthey would still learn.  They&#39;ve learned how to walk and talk.  You didn&#39;t<br/>\nsit down and try to teach them that, did you?  I sure hope not!  But you did<br/>\ncheer their efforts, and talk with them and around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nForget structure when they reach 6 or 7.  Forget structure forever.  You&#39;ll<br/>\ndo different things at 6 or 7, different than at 4, different than at 16.<br/>\nBut you don&#39;t need structure to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the things you enjoy doing, and how you&#39;d like your friends to<br/>\nencourage you to try their favorite things.  You might like them to point<br/>\nout that they saw a lecture at the public library on Peace in the Middle<br/>\nEast, if they knew you were interested in that sort of thing.  You<br/>\ndefinitely would NOT want them to sign you up and make you go to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if your best friend loves art, maybe she&#39;d try to get you to accompany<br/>\nher to the opening of a new show at her favorite gallery.  But she wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nannounce that you had to come, like it or not, because it&#39;s good for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreat your kids with the same respect.  If they&#39;re interested in bugs, help<br/>\nthem find books at the library that might interest them, and offer to read<br/>\nthem if they&#39;re in the mood.  Leave them lying around where they can flip<br/>\nthrough and look at the pictures.  Find a time when they would like to go<br/>\noutside and bring a shovel to turn over dirt, move rocks, and bug hunt.<br/>\nSuggest that you know how to make a bug house out of tuna cans and wire if<br/>\nanybody would like to make one.  Be prepared to take no for an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nShow your children the things you&#39;re interested it.  Take them to the zoo if<br/>\nyou love looking at the animals, not because zoos are good for them.  Play<br/>\nyour favorite music and dance around to it.  Bet they&#39;ll join you.  Get out<br/>\nthe craft supplies and start making things.  Maybe they&#39;ll join you.  Maybe<br/>\nthey won&#39;t.  Either way, you&#39;ll have fun because you&#39;d be doing things YOU<br/>\nenjoy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son reads quite well.  Some days he chooses to read an entire book.  Some<br/>\ndays he only reads things he needs to read -- like street signs.  By giving<br/>\nhim the freedom to choose to read, and to choose what to read, he<br/>\nvoluntarily reads many things.  But if I required that he read a book a day<br/>\nor a chapter a day, reading would be like chores are for many kids.  Just<br/>\nanother thing to check off the list.  He wouldn&#39;t see books the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like it may be a major paradigm shift from where you are.<br/>\nPlease ask more questions if it doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57561,"nextTopicId":57590}}
