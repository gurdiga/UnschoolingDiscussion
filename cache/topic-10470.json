How do any of you get anything else done in the house <br/>\nwith having the kids there all day?  I need to clean out the freezer, washing <br/>\nthe windows outside.... Do you just include your kids in these tasks (then it <br/>\nturns a 1 hour job into a 4 hour job) or what?  I can&#39;t do all this stuff <br/>\nwhen they go to bed as then I need to work and although hubby does most of <br/>\nthat kind of stuff, I&#39;d like to do some of it?  Or are is all your time <br/>\ncompletely with the kids?  My best friend asked me the other day &quot;well how <br/>\nare you suppose to get anything done&quot; and I didn&#39;t have an answer for that <br/>\nexcept to say &quot;I&#39;;ll take them with me&quot; (we were talking about going to the <br/>\nbank, groceries store etc, outside things)... Then today I realized I need to <br/>\ndo lots of things around the house... Am I just being overconcerned about <br/>\nhaving the entertain them?<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback would be great...<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10455,"nextTopicId":10480}}
