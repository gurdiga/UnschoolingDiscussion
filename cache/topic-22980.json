Perhaps the reason you can&#39;t find anything is that it<br/>\nisn&#39;t possible to do it correctly.  (Those ones we used to view in school<br/>\nwere dramatically WRONG).  The scale of the sun versus the planets would<br/>\nrequire that you place the balls either miles apart from each other or have<br/>\nstyrofoam balls the size of an atom.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help in understanding the relationship of the planets to the sun,<br/>\nbut I&#39;d recommend giving up on trying to make it even close to accurate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry www.solarsystem.com for the proper placement.  They also have some cool<br/>\ngraphics you could follow to paint your planets.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RValvo7626@...\">RValvo7626@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RValvo7626@...\">RValvo7626@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, August 03, 2001 3:56 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:solar system model<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      I need help.
