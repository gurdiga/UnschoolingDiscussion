They have somehow learned to read,<br/>\nwrite, figure ratios, read maps, estimate milage and gas costs for our<br/>\nholidays, do their own banking, cook meals, change a tire,  build a<br/>\ncomputer....and so on without so much as a day&#39;s &quot;seat work&quot;.  They are<br/>\nbright, resourceful, creative young men and I have learned much about<br/>\nlearning from them.  We have become a whole family of autodidacts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPassion is our curriculum - whatever the passion du jour is becomes the<br/>\ndelivery system.  Baseball has been and continues to be a large factor<br/>\nin this family&#39;s learning, and we have all learned much from playing,<br/>\nreading about, watching, umping baseball.
