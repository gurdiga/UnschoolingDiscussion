Maybe someone else would.  I suppose I think it&#39;s all so <br/>\nsituational that it&#39;s difficult to really come up with something without <br/>\nbeing in the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids never really bugged each other too much, as we&#39;d really worked on <br/>\nrespecting each other and recognizing what was hurtful/not hurtful since <br/>\nthey were very, very little.  We also used to play &#39;Is that important?&quot; to <br/>\nsee if what they were arguing over was really as important as they felt it <br/>\nwas or was there another way around it?  (which let them both talk about <br/>\nwhy something is important to them (or sometimes, why it turned out to not <br/>\nbe so important.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worst situation that comes to my mind was once, when my kids were 7 and <br/>\n9ish, (they&#39;d been bickering for a while and had just had a real <br/>\nknock-down, screamy fight, over &#39;nothing&#39; at all! - and I was SO mad I was <br/>\ntear-ing up) I remember saying to them that I was really, really, really <br/>\nupset and that someday when they&#39;re adults, I wasn&#39;t going to be around <br/>\nanymore and it would be the two of them out there together in the world and <br/>\nif they *can&#39;t* count on each other as brother and sister to protect each <br/>\nother and love each other, who *would* they be able to count on?!  and that <br/>\nmaybe they&#39;d want to give that some thought.  (then left the room to cool <br/>\ndown.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if it was the best way of going about it, but it worked for my <br/>\nkids at that particular moment in time.  It might have been that I usually <br/>\ndidn&#39;t blow up over things like this, so maybe the shock of it made them <br/>\nstop and think.  I&#39;d like to hope they wanted someone (besides Mom) who&#39;d <br/>\nback them up unconditionally and care about them no-matter-what - and maybe <br/>\nthat meant *not* bugging the snot out of each other now...<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, I guess I just made a point out of doing nice things for them <br/>\n&#39;because they&#39;re family&#39; and every now and then enlisting one of them in <br/>\nhelping me do something nice for one of their sibs or their dad, &#39;because <br/>\nthey&#39;re family&#39;.  They seemed to like surprising folks like that.  ...and <br/>\nit&#39;s another way to feel good about caring for people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure someone out there has some better suggestions, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yesterday and today I made a conscious effort to<br/>\n&gt;give him some of my undivided attention and I have seen a behavior<br/>\n&gt;improvement already. :)  THANK YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rock ON!  I&#39;ll bet that feels tremendous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If the child doesn&#39;t want to &quot;take the hurt away&quot;, isn&#39;t it punitive<br/>\n&gt;to make the child take care of the other child?  I can&#39;t see it<br/>\n&gt;working here anyway.  I can see myself &quot;making&quot; a child hug another<br/>\n&gt;child.  I would have to wrap their arms around the other child, hold<br/>\n&gt;their feet back from kicking while doing it, keep their teeth from<br/>\n&gt;biting while hugging, and keep my hands over their fists to keep<br/>\n&gt;them from pinching/hitting/scratching while hugging.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, nononononooooo....  Not like that.  You&#39;re right that THAT would be <br/>\ndisastrous!  ...and it&#39;s never meant to be punitive, or imply guilt or <br/>\netc.  The injuring child is only injuring because they can&#39;t figure out how <br/>\nelse to deal with whatever it is that they can&#39;t deal with.  Why punish him <br/>\nmore?  He&#39;s already not able to deal!  The idea is to help him learn to <br/>\ncare-take too, and make it feel better than hurting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if they can&#39;t do it themselves, do it for them.. that is, YOU sit with <br/>\nthe injured child and hug them.  No dirty looks at the injurer.  No <br/>\nrecriminations.  No attention at all, at first.  Just focus on making the <br/>\nhurt go away for the injured.  Maybe ask the injuring child to go get YOU <br/>\nsome ice (not for the sibling) and if they get it, thank them kindly and <br/>\ngently mention *To The Injured Child* how their brother is helping you <br/>\n&#39;take the hurt away&#39;.  Don&#39;t talk about &#39;sorry&#39; or &#39;forgiveness&#39; at <br/>\nall.  Talk with the injured child about how they&#39;re doing and what you can <br/>\ndo to make the hurt get better.  Rock them a little where they are, on the <br/>\nfloor.  Maybe ask the injuring child to sit next to you and snuggle you <br/>\n(make you feel better?)   Make no mention of the injured child to the <br/>\ninjuring child.  YOU snuggle the injured child and form a barrier of sorts <br/>\nbetween the two, gradually eliminating the barrier until you&#39;re hugging <br/>\nthem both at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n...and of course, if you ever, inadvertently &#39;hurt&#39; one of the kids or a <br/>\npet, make a big fuss over &#39;taking the hurt away!&#39;  Show by example.  (and <br/>\ndo it with inanimate objects as well, in a smaller way.  Did they break a <br/>\nvase?  &quot;Here, I&#39;ll get the broom and dustpan.  Do you want me to help you <br/>\nsweep that up?  I&#39;ll bet that was pretty scary when you realized it was <br/>\ngoing to break!  Should we put it in the inside or outside trash do you <br/>\nthink?  There&#39;s some pretty sharp pieces, aren&#39;t there?&quot;)  Come to think of <br/>\nit, maybe the best way would be to start him off with animals (caring for <br/>\nhurt ones), and compliment the heck out of how he&#39;s so gentle and caring.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou *do* make notice of when he&#39;s being lovely to his sibs, right?

For example,<br/>\nwe&#39;ve had trouble with scissors in our house this year with my daughter<br/>\nand her cousin. It started when they cut off my daughter&#39;s long<br/>\nbeautiful hair. They also cut the cord on the blinds, and cut up a few<br/>\nthings in the house. In short order they were banned from scissors.<br/>\nRecently they were doing a craft with our Japanese student, and they<br/>\nwere left with scissors, and alas, again cut something. This time our<br/>\nfuton chair cover. They are 4 and 5 years old - so they&#39;re certainly old<br/>\nenough to know that this isn&#39;t a good choice. I got mad at them and then<br/>\nI told them if they cannot make good choices when no one is watching<br/>\nthem, then they would have to be watched all the time. I made them stick<br/>\nright by my side. When I was working on the computer they sat on the<br/>\nfloor beside me reading a book. Then I made them come downstairs to get<br/>\na load of laundry. We&#39;d sit in the family room to fold it and I let them<br/>\nwatch TV while I did it - but I would purposefully get up right when<br/>\nthey were really getting into it and say, &quot;Okay. Time to go into the<br/>\nkitchen.&quot; Or wherever. They didn&#39;t dare complain because they knew the<br/>\ngravity of what they had done and knew they didn&#39;t have any room for<br/>\nnegotiation. We only had to do this for about 3 hours until they begged<br/>\nme to trust them again. So we did it for the next 3 hours in a little<br/>\nmore limited sense. The lesson stuck. We haven&#39;t had a problem with<br/>\nscissors for a long time. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my husband and his siblings weren&#39;t getting along my MIL would make<br/>\nthem hold hands or sit on chairs with their knees touching, until they<br/>\ntalked and solved whatever the problem was. I&#39;m actually quite amazed at<br/>\nhow they get along in his family. They just were plain not allowed to be<br/>\nunkind to each other. It doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t have<br/>\ndisagreements - but unkindness was not tolerated. I hope we can do that<br/>\nin our family with our children as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnother thing that comes to my mind is to have a theme of the week or<br/>\nday, or whatever seems appropriate. Have a phrase that you ask them to<br/>\nsay to you. For example, my daughter has one lately that she got from a<br/>\nbook that says, &quot;I&#39;ll be happy all day if I obey.&quot; I&#39;m surprised<br/>\nactually how many times she comes back to the little quip. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nsomething I started - she got it out of a book - but she has really made<br/>\nit stick in her mind and the process has made me think it might be<br/>\nworthwhile to come up with some more of those in our home. Not sure what<br/>\nthey&#39;ll be yet. I&#39;d like something right now that helps them remember to<br/>\nclean up toys!! But that&#39;s an entirely different thread. :0)<br/>\n <br/>\nGood for you for reaching out and asking for help. Some people just<br/>\nfigure kids fight and that&#39;s life. I don&#39;t think it has to be that way.<br/>\n <br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heidi@...\">heidi@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 11, 2003 5:58 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] parenting dilemmas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a toughie and it&#39;s something we&#39;ve worked on avoiding with our<br/>\nown <br/>\nkids.  (and its&#39; worked!) So, know that it IS possible to have kids who <br/>\ndon&#39;t torment each other.  It&#39;s not something that you can just <br/>\nplug-in-and-play, but is rather a paradigm shift in how you think about <br/>\nrelationships.  I don&#39;t know you, and I don&#39;t know your kids, so I&#39;m<br/>\njust <br/>\ngoing to throw stuff out there to be thought about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, you&#39;ve read and ingested and re-read Adelle Fabers&#39; books, <br/>\nright?  The whole &#39;learn to talk so kids will listen&#39; thing?  It&#39;s<br/>\nreally <br/>\nhelped us out with learning how to talk with our kids and identifying <br/>\nsubtly aggressive behavior, which means we can deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, do some work on self-assertiveness for Yourself.  I&#39;m<br/>\nwondering <br/>\nif sometimes it&#39;s difficult for you to say when something is not feeling<br/>\n<br/>\nright for you and sitting that child down to peacefully talk it over<br/>\nwith <br/>\nthem so you can understand WHY they want to write that their brother is <br/>\nstupid and WHY they were trying to trick you into doing something you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to do (ie, write that the brother was stupid) and thereby <br/>\nfacilitating the other brother&#39;s being mean to the younger brother.  I <br/>\nmean, there&#39;s a Whole LOT of discussion that needs to go on about that<br/>\nwith <br/>\nthe child in question (and not in a mean way, but in a gently<br/>\ninquisitive <br/>\nway, to find out what they&#39;re thinking and how they got to think that <br/>\nway.)  Then you both/all need to talk about how it&#39;s making you, the<br/>\nmommy, <br/>\nfeel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also suggest doing some work on family inter-dependence, that is, <br/>\nemphasizing how one family member can be affected by another family<br/>\nmember <br/>\nbecause of the love within the family and talking about it with great <br/>\nconcern for BOTH parties (because after all, if family won&#39;t stick up<br/>\nfor <br/>\nor care for family, what&#39;s left?)  If one child &#39;doesn&#39;t want to hear<br/>\nit&#39;, <br/>\nmaybe say, &quot;I am very sad when you hurt my family and I need to talk<br/>\nwith <br/>\nyou about it.   Hurting your brother makes my heart cry.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>\nbeing hurt and I need you to stop.  I don&#39;t know how to stop feeling the<br/>\n<br/>\nhurt.  Will you help me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think some of it is that the middle (and teasing) child is<br/>\nlooking <br/>\nfor more attention from you?  If so, maybe make some dedicated time for <br/>\njust Mom-and-middle-child, say 10 or 15 minutes solid when NOTHING will <br/>\npull you away from talking to him and playing with him, and doing<br/>\nwhatever <br/>\nhe wants to do.  If another child needs you, tell them that you&#39;re with <br/>\nthis child now and you&#39;ll be there in a while.  Ignore the phone. <br/>\nEtc.  Just you and he, every day, for a certain time (and this goes for <br/>\nEACH of the children.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the daughter, I&#39;d have told the 3 year old that he didn&#39;t have to<br/>\ngo <br/>\ninside, but that his sister was scared about being alone does he<br/>\nremember <br/>\nhow it feels when he is scared?  Well, he and mommy are going to help<br/>\nher <br/>\nbe not so scared and if he didn&#39;t want to go inside, then he could stay<br/>\nin <br/>\nthe car (with the windows cracked) but that you were going inside to<br/>\nhelp <br/>\nsister feel not so scared and would watch him from the window.  Ask him <br/>\nDoes he want to bring a book or a toy for the car?  Then I&#39;d plop myself<br/>\nin <br/>\nthe front window where I&#39;d be with my daughter and could wave (and make <br/>\nfunny faces) to my son, out in the car.  Maybe make it focus on taking<br/>\ncare <br/>\nof (and relating to) someone else when they&#39;re feeling badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich reminds me, we have a tradition of, &quot;if you cause the pain, you<br/>\ntake <br/>\ncare of it &#39;tll it&#39;s gone.&quot;  If I hurt someone, I need to stay with that<br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone until they&#39;re okay again, and take care of them and get them ice<br/>\nor <br/>\nhugs or whatever they need to be okay again.  This goes for physical as <br/>\nwell as emotional owies and it gives people a way to stop being the <br/>\n&#39;meanie&#39; and become the &#39;caring person&#39;.   No Guilt.  No <br/>\nrecriminations.  Just taking care.  You&#39;ve got to help them do it<br/>\n(sweetly) <br/>\nthe first few times, but later on, they&#39;ll generally move to do it on<br/>\ntheir <br/>\nown.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.  There&#39;s so much more, but without knowing your kids, I&#39;d be <br/>\nwhistling into the wind more than I am already!<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

The second being taking<br/>\na humorous approach. The other day, Jason (6 yo) started calling Kyle (3 yo) stupid.<br/>\nI looked at him and said, wait a minute...are you telling me that I have a stupid child?<br/>\nWait a minute...I don&#39;t remember giving birth to any stupid children. Where did that stupid<br/>\nkid go, I can&#39;t find him, he isn&#39;t around here, I only see smart sweet kids...etc. Jason <br/>\nstarted laughing and stopped the name calling. Then today<br/>\nthey started into calling each other names in the backseat of the van. So I joined in! I <br/>\npretended to get really excited about our new game and called Jason a big fat broccoli<br/>\nhead. Then called Kyle a cauliflower poo-poo head. They LOVED it, kept asking me to<br/>\ncall them more names. Then when Jason started calling Kyle a stupid freak, I pointed out<br/>\nhow that was more personal and could be mean. We also talked about how it was ok to call<br/>\neach other names for fun, but if it hurt the others feelings then we had stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason has also started cutting Kyle down when Kyle is not as good at something (like a <br/>\ncomputer game etc) so we have been having lots of talks about how just because someone does<br/>\nnot know something/is not good at something does not mean that they are stupid. That often<br/>\nthey just do not have the as much experience at something as someone else (using the example<br/>\nthat mommy is better then Jason at many things but that does not make Jason stupid or dumb.<br/>\nThat as he (and Kyle) get older they will get better at many things).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that there is one answer for this...just keep talking and for us turning it into<br/>\na joke has worked well. I think that it is also important to tell the kids that it is ok to<br/>\nbe mad at/not like each other at times but it is not ok to cut the other down or be mean to<br/>\neach other. I have been trying to give them acceptable ways of expressing their feelings.<br/>\nIt sure can be hard to listen to sometimes though!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"MARK and JULIE SOLICH","from":"&quot;MARK and JULIE SOLICH&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] parenting dilemmas","postDate":"1047444064","msgId":60833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTkwMWMyZTg1MSRhZTA3M2M2MCQzYzE5MzJkMkBtYXJrPg==","referencesHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMzAzMTExNjE4NTguMDIxMTRjMDhAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":60830,"nextInTopic":60838,"prevInTime":60832,"nextInTime":60834,"topicId":60798,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... or ...

(and its&#39; worked!) So, know that it IS possible to have kids who <br/>\ndon&#39;t torment each other.  It&#39;s not something that you can just <br/>\nplug-in-and-play, but is rather a paradigm shift in how you think about <br/>\nrelationships.  I don&#39;t know you, and I don&#39;t know your kids, so I&#39;m just <br/>\ngoing to throw stuff out there to be thought about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, you&#39;ve read and ingested and re-read Adelle Fabers&#39; books, <br/>\nright?  The whole &#39;learn to talk so kids will listen&#39; thing?  It&#39;s really <br/>\nhelped us out with learning how to talk with our kids and identifying <br/>\nsubtly aggressive behavior, which means we can deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, do some work on self-assertiveness for Yourself.  I&#39;m wondering <br/>\nif sometimes it&#39;s difficult for you to say when something is not feeling <br/>\nright for you and sitting that child down to peacefully talk it over with <br/>\nthem so you can understand WHY they want to write that their brother is <br/>\nstupid and WHY they were trying to trick you into doing something you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to do (ie, write that the brother was stupid) and thereby <br/>\nfacilitating the other brother&#39;s being mean to the younger brother.  I <br/>\nmean, there&#39;s a Whole LOT of discussion that needs to go on about that with <br/>\nthe child in question (and not in a mean way, but in a gently inquisitive <br/>\nway, to find out what they&#39;re thinking and how they got to think that <br/>\nway.)  Then you both/all need to talk about how it&#39;s making you, the mommy, <br/>\nfeel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also suggest doing some work on family inter-dependence, that is, <br/>\nemphasizing how one family member can be affected by another family member <br/>\nbecause of the love within the family and talking about it with great <br/>\nconcern for BOTH parties (because after all, if family won&#39;t stick up for <br/>\nor care for family, what&#39;s left?)  If one child &#39;doesn&#39;t want to hear it&#39;, <br/>\nmaybe say, &quot;I am very sad when you hurt my family and I need to talk with <br/>\nyou about it.   Hurting your brother makes my heart cry.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>\nbeing hurt and I need you to stop.  I don&#39;t know how to stop feeling the <br/>\nhurt.  Will you help me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think some of it is that the middle (and teasing) child is looking <br/>\nfor more attention from you?  If so, maybe make some dedicated time for <br/>\njust Mom-and-middle-child, say 10 or 15 minutes solid when NOTHING will <br/>\npull you away from talking to him and playing with him, and doing whatever <br/>\nhe wants to do.  If another child needs you, tell them that you&#39;re with <br/>\nthis child now and you&#39;ll be there in a while.  Ignore the phone. <br/>\nEtc.  Just you and he, every day, for a certain time (and this goes for <br/>\nEACH of the children.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the daughter, I&#39;d have told the 3 year old that he didn&#39;t have to go <br/>\ninside, but that his sister was scared about being alone does he remember <br/>\nhow it feels when he is scared?  Well, he and mommy are going to help her <br/>\nbe not so scared and if he didn&#39;t want to go inside, then he could stay in <br/>\nthe car (with the windows cracked) but that you were going inside to help <br/>\nsister feel not so scared and would watch him from the window.  Ask him <br/>\nDoes he want to bring a book or a toy for the car?  Then I&#39;d plop myself in <br/>\nthe front window where I&#39;d be with my daughter and could wave (and make <br/>\nfunny faces) to my son, out in the car.  Maybe make it focus on taking care <br/>\nof (and relating to) someone else when they&#39;re feeling badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich reminds me, we have a tradition of, &quot;if you cause the pain, you take <br/>\ncare of it &#39;tll it&#39;s gone.&quot;  If I hurt someone, I need to stay with that <br/>\nsomeone until they&#39;re okay again, and take care of them and get them ice or <br/>\nhugs or whatever they need to be okay again.  This goes for physical as <br/>\nwell as emotional owies and it gives people a way to stop being the <br/>\n&#39;meanie&#39; and become the &#39;caring person&#39;.   No Guilt.  No <br/>\nrecriminations.  Just taking care.  You&#39;ve got to help them do it (sweetly) <br/>\nthe first few times, but later on, they&#39;ll generally move to do it on their <br/>\nown.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.

I&#39;m not c happy with the <br/>\nway I handled them but couldn&#39;t figure out a better way.  I&#39;m sure <br/>\nsomeone here can help me learn from my mistakes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst situation: <br/>\nMy boys, ages 5 and 3, fight fiercely.  They call each other stupid <br/>\nall the time.  If I ask my 5 year old why he hurt his brother, his <br/>\nanswer is often &quot;Because he&#39;s stupid&quot;.  I&#39;ve tried naming his <br/>\nfeelings for him but he doesn&#39;t want to hear it most of the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday he brought me a piece of paper and asked me to write &quot;Luke <br/>\nis stupid&quot; for him.  I told him that I wouldn&#39;t, and I told him I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to write things that aren&#39;t true, and that it&#39;s not true <br/>\nthat Luke is stupid&quot;.  So he asked me to write &quot;Luke is nice&quot; for <br/>\nhim and I did.  A few minutes later he came with a piece of paper <br/>\nand asked me to write just the word stupid.  Now I KNEW he was up to <br/>\nsomething, but I wrote it anyway.  He took it and copied stupid <br/>\nunder the word nice that I had written in my sentence for him.  And <br/>\nhe paraded the paper in front of his brother, telling him that mommy <br/>\nwrote Luke is nice but he changed nice to stupid.  And of course it <br/>\nresulted in them beating each other up--Luke scratching his face, <br/>\nMatt pounding him with his fists until I pried them apart and made <br/>\nthem stop fighting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond situation: <br/>\nMy daughter (9) was invited to a friend&#39;s house today, and at the <br/>\nlast minute decided that she was nervous about going and asked me to <br/>\nstay with her for a few minutes at their house.  I told her that I <br/>\nwould, but my 5 year old heard me and declared that he would NOT <br/>\ngo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI told him that I would call his Nanny (grandmother) and ask if he <br/>\ncould stay with her, and he said no.  So I asked him if he would <br/>\nlike me to call her and see if she could come here so he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to leave the house and he said no, but my 3 year old said he <br/>\nwould like that.  I called her, but she said that they&#39;re welcome to <br/>\ncome there but she couldn&#39;t come here.  I told her ok.  My 5 year <br/>\nold was very upset.  I could barely get his socks and shoes on him <br/>\nand I could barely get him to the van.  We got to their Nanny&#39;s <br/>\nhouse and he wouldn&#39;t get out of the car and the 3 year old didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to stay by himself, so I apologized to Nanny and drove my <br/>\ndaughter to her friend&#39;s house. <br/>\n<br/>\n I apologized to my daughter and told her that I couldn&#39;t stay with <br/>\nher and that this was something she would just have to do on her <br/>\nown.  She was upset about me not staying with her like I promised <br/>\nbut at least she did stay--she often cries when I have to leave her <br/>\nand she didn&#39;t this time.  She saw everything I had to go through to <br/>\nget her brothers into the car and even though I didn&#39;t say anything <br/>\nabout it, the stress must have been showing on my face.  (I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I&#39;ve adequately explained the HUGE struggle it was to get my 5 <br/>\nyear old into that car)  She told me, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to have caused you <br/>\nso much trouble&quot; and she broke my heart.  I really wanted to be <br/>\nthere for her and stay with her at her friend&#39;s house but I <br/>\nabsolutely could not.  And now I&#39;m feeling like there must be <br/>\nsomething I could have done differently. :( <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m opening myself up for any and all suggestions and constructive <br/>\ncriticisms!<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60978,"nextTopicId":60996}}
