He&#39;s gone on to <br/>\nread a couple more Harry Potter books since then, but he&#39;s listened <br/>\nto most of them on tape.  He loves to listen to books on tape and <br/>\nplay with Legos or army men at the same time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also reads the info on his PSII games that he needs and his pc <br/>\ngames.

He sees no need for it yet and he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy it.  He&#39;s too busy.  Once we were out of printer ink and ds <br/>\nwanted some cheats for ps2 game.  I thought he might write out of <br/>\nnecessity.  I looked over at the computer and I saw his 7 yo sister <br/>\ncopying his cheats for him (she loves to write/copy). lol He is very <br/>\nresourceful!  He knows his way around a keyboard.

I think back then there wasn&#39;t this big discrepancy between her<br/>\nwriting ability and her reading ability - she was satisfied with pretty<br/>\nsimple stuff. Now she&#39;s not, she wants to be able to write stories like<br/>\nthe ones she reads, and she just can&#39;t write like A. Conan Doyle. We<br/>\ntried the dictating thing but she never really liked it..<br/>\n<br/>\nNow she&#39;s learning cursive, at her request - she asked me to do a letter<br/>\na day, capital and lower case, and write them on the white board and make<br/>\na space for her to write them underneath. It&#39;s been pretty cool - she&#39;s<br/>\nbeen able to write her name in cursive for a year or so but hasn&#39;t wanted<br/>\nto do anymore since her dad decided to &quot;help&quot; :-P The porblem is that<br/>\nwe&#39;re now on F, and I went to a wacky school and learned some form of<br/>\ncursive that no one else has ever seen, and my Fs and Ts look weird... so<br/>\nI have to find a website with standard cursive.
