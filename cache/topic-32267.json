SHE lags behind the boys academically so far, but she is very <br/>\n&gt; creative , artististic, dancing aroudn the room every day~ AND makes up <br/>\n&gt; beautiful stories which i type on WORD and then read back to her. someday i <br/>\n&gt; know she will want to read them. sometimes, i just put cool stuff up or <br/>\n&gt; throw 50 worksheets down on the floor(of course thats 15+ apiece!!!! ~) and <br/>\n&gt; they will want to do them. they also love the games i make and we play <br/>\n&gt; cards and dice while waiting for food at restaurants.......we also look <br/>\n&gt; stuff up online .......but not that much yet. I DO ~ they play on line <br/>\n&gt; more. I LOVE UNSCHOOLING&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just providing them opportuinites every day. <br/>\n&gt; We have a friend dying of 3 forms of cancer...we spend time making him <br/>\n&gt; stuff and visiting him. THat to me is invaluable. We are a spiritual family <br/>\n&gt; who believes tog. in GOD and the universe and we talk about GOD every day. <br/>\n&gt; We had to leave the church job i had (church organist and choir director) <br/>\n&gt; becuase of the narrow minds and my 8 yr old was questioning the existence <br/>\n&gt; of hell!!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!! God wouldn&#39;t do that ~ he <br/>\n&gt; said......YIPPPPEEEE For thinking kids and discriminating kids. By spending <br/>\n&gt; so much time with them, i find that we talk about everything and they ask <br/>\n&gt; about everything and we repsect each others opinions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":22330745,"authorName":"dmm5692@aol.com","from":"dmm5692@...","profile":"dmm19562000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1825","postDate":"1015930819","msgId":32267,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliLjI0MjEyMGExLjI5YmYzOWMzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":32268,"prevInTime":32266,"nextInTime":32268,"topicId":32267,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/11/02 9:25:32 PM Eastern Standard Time, ... im an unschooler in new york state!!!! just outside of bflo. where are you moving to elissa??","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1205956721\">In a message dated 3/11/02 9:25:32 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>im an unschooler in new york state!!!! just outside of bflo. where are you <br/>\nmoving to elissa??  ~denise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32273,"nextTopicId":32300}}
