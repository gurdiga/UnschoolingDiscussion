Arithmetic for Human Beings","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1501230836\">Serendipitously I stumbled across a book at the library tonight that I (so <br/>\nfar) think could be wonderful for adults who fear math. Arithmetic for Human <br/>\nBeings (An anti-textbook for people who loathe arithmetic) by Robert Froman<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the introduction:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Millions of people loathe arithmetic. They have good reason to. The subject <br/>\nis taught in most elementary schools as if the whole idea is to make it <br/>\nloathsome. Only those with great aptitude for it are likely to retain interest in <br/>\nit...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unlike the algebra and geometry inflicted on highschool students, <br/>\narithmetic will not go away and leave you alone after you are paroled from the <br/>\nschoolroom. All life long it keeps popping up in supermarkets, kitchens, workshops, <br/>\noffices, almost everywhere - even in the far reaches of the backwoods. When it <br/>\ndoes, the schools have left most of us no alternative to going into a trance <br/>\nand trying to remember elementary textbook procedures...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat schoolroom experience of arithmetic is much like what continues to <br/>\nshort-circuit many adult minds in later years. For such adults that experience has <br/>\nmade unquestionable the belief that in any arithmetic question the numbers <br/>\ninvolved are all-important and the proper way to perform each of the four basic <br/>\noperations invariable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn real life the numbers are NOT the most important parts of problems. What <br/>\nthe numbers stand for is what matters most. How the necessary operations on <br/>\nthose numbers should be performed depends on what you want to know...<br/>\n<br/>\nArithmetic for Human Beings is intended as the opposite of a textbook, a kind <br/>\nof anti-textbook. It is primarily a book to be read, not labored over. The <br/>\nsuggestions it offers are not going to be repeated endlessly, summarized at the <br/>\nends of chapters, and reinforced with large numbers of space-filling examples <br/>\nand exercises. Such paraphernalia would be useless for the purpose here. The <br/>\nonly way you can learn to make use of these suggestions is by trying them in <br/>\nsituations that matter to you, not on artificial problems dreamed up by someone <br/>\nelse. The suggestions are meaningful only when you really want to know <br/>\nsomething that arithmetic can help you find out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat follows is advice on estimation, approximation, mental arithmetic, and <br/>\ncutting problems down to size - covering multiplication, addition, subtraction, <br/>\ndivision, fractions, negative numbers, measurements, and probability. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is long out of print but seems to be available used very cheaply. <br/>\n(If you look on Amazon check by author, I found it catalogued there as  ARITH <br/>\nFOR HUM BNGS ) I&#39;m going to get a copy for my most math phobic friend, the one <br/>\nwho I promised could always call me for help in explaining math to her kids <br/>\nwhen she was talking about needing to send them to school because of math. She <br/>\npanics and quite literally shuts down when faced with numbers, this looks like <br/>\nit might help.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101945,"nextTopicId":102344}}
