Keep talking to<br/>\n&gt;him.  If it felt okay, I might ask hom flat-out if he thought he<br/>\n&gt;should do the school thing because everyone else does.

There is so much stuff out there it&#39;s hard<br/>\n&gt;to choose.  I know that for me, that overload always brings me to a<br/>\n&gt;screeching halt - - when I get to the point where I have way more to<br/>\n&gt;do than humanly possible, I can&#39;t get anything done.  I have to stop<br/>\n&gt;and consciously set priorities and get rid of the stuff I don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt;want to do.<br/>\n&gt;So, maybe if you bought him a book about what a curriculum should have<br/>\n&gt;(the What your x grader needs to know series, I don&#39;t like the grade<br/>\n&gt;level thing, but they are concise for this purpose) and he could work<br/>\n&gt;through it at his leisure?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the past I&#39;ve printed out the BC curriculum learning outcomes for him to <br/>\nlook at.  I think they&#39;re quite overwhelming for him.  (They&#39;re <br/>\noverwhelming for *me*!)  But you&#39;re probably right about his not knowing <br/>\nwhere to start.  That&#39;s probably why he grabbed onto the reading idea.  In <br/>\na day or two I&#39;ll ask if he&#39;s found a book he&#39;d like to read or whether he <br/>\nwants my help in picking something.  If he still dithers, I&#39;m going to drop <br/>\nit for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Here another thought:  Buy him some computer software,  there are high<br/>\n&gt;school programs that have english, math, science etc.  If he likes the<br/>\n&gt;computer, that might be a better way for him to learn anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He has yet to enjoy any of the &quot;educational&quot; software he&#39;s had access to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also,<br/>\n&gt;look into cool software like, Zap and Dr. Sulphur for science.  Way<br/>\n&gt;cool stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve actually got Dr. Sulphur, but I was never able to get it to work.  It <br/>\nwas passed on by a friend whose kid grew out of it.  Maybe I&#39;ll have <br/>\nanother go at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But most of all, keep him talking to you.  Ask him lots of questions,<br/>\n&gt;tell him what you are doing, talk about the weather, but don&#39;t let him<br/>\n&gt;shut you or the world out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks.

(The carrot is the computer and the<br/>\n&gt; internet access, along with a fair bit of money.)  I was thinking we would<br/>\n&gt; have to leave the program.  Things change at grade 8, (He&#39;s registered 2<br/>\n&gt; grades back from what he &quot;should&quot; be) and they want much more specific<br/>\n&gt; reporting, with certain subjects covered, etc. starting in grade 8.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The online teacher has said that we could do an Individual Education Plan<br/>\n&gt; with him.  I asked what that would involve, and he gave as an example,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Well, maybe we could contract with Lars to read 2 books per month and<br/>\n&gt; write about them in his own words.  I&#39;m guessing there would be similar<br/>\n&gt; things in other subjects.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just assumed Lars wouldn&#39;t want to do this, and I certainly would leave<br/>\n&gt; the program before making him.  But he surprised me by saying that he<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t mind doing that now.  (I&#39;m pretty sure that *I&#39;ve* got the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling mindset, but I really doubt now that I&#39;ve gotten it across to<br/>\nhim.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My first thought was that he was looking for more structure, and I tried<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; explore what he might be looking for.  I told him that I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; willing to impose structure on him, but I could help him decide what kind<br/>\n&gt; of structure he might be needing and asked him to think about<br/>\n&gt; it.  (Remember this is the kid who doesn&#39;t like talking about feelings and<br/>\n&gt; hates making decisions.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So today I asked him whether I had maybe jumped the gun on the structure<br/>\n&gt; thing, and that maybe what he really meant was that he&#39;d be willing to do<br/>\n&gt; that much to keep the computer.  He said no, he would like to start that<br/>\n&gt; now.  I started going into the, &quot;I&#39;m not willing to impose structure, but<br/>\n&gt; we could talk about how I could help him find what he&#39;s looking for&quot;<br/>\n&gt; routine.  He listened for a minute and then asked if he could use the<br/>\n&gt; computer.  Ok, end of conversation for now.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A while later, I told him that I understood that he&#39;d like to start doing<br/>\n&gt; some reading and then writing about what he&#39;d read, and asked what was<br/>\n&gt; stopping him from doing that now.  No answer.  Again I asked him to think<br/>\n&gt; about it.  I told him that as far as I could see, the only thing needed<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; motivation, and I couldn&#39;t supply that.  I left it that he needed to think<br/>\n&gt; about what he needed from me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep in mind, especially those of you who haven&#39;t heard my stories, that<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried imposing structure on him in the past at a couple of different<br/>\n&gt; times.  It just turned into a battle that I&#39;m not willing to repeat.  I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; sooner send him to school.  Another thing is that he seems to be vegging a<br/>\n&gt; lot, and I often think he&#39;s bored, but he seems to have no interest in<br/>\n&gt; anything I suggest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All but one of his friends go to school, and that one is doing a rigid<br/>\n&gt; correspondance version of high school.

I<br/>\n&gt; try to talk about his strengths, especially to other people when I know he<br/>\n&gt; can hear.  But he still seems to think he&#39;s stupid.
