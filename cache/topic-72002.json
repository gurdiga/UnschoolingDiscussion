I had a copy of it printed out in my homeschooling notebook (a 2 <br/>\ninch binder that weighs about a hundred pounds, but I poke holes in <br/>\nEVERYTHING and file it in their for the doubting days)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are coming to the end of our second year(first full year) of <br/>\nunschooling and were discussing putting together a portfolio. As a <br/>\nformer schooler, I know she expresses concern that she is not as <br/>\n*smart* as the other kids her age, that she doesn&#39;t sit down and <br/>\nlearn enough....still deschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I came across this sheet, and had an example off the top of my <br/>\nhead for every topic on the scope and sequence, with exception to <br/>\nprime numbers and sentence types (declarative, exclamatory, <br/>\ninterrogative if I recall--I thought it was insignificant because she <br/>\nknows how to speak and write correctly without knowing how to label <br/>\nthe sentence type). <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was like WOW! I learned a lot this year without sitting down and <br/>\ndoing much at all! <br/>\n<br/>\nI really tried to impress that this list doesn&#39;t mean she knows <br/>\neverything that a kid at the local school knows, because some school <br/>\ncurriculums vary from district to school to even classroom. I said <br/>\nthat someone will always know more than her about a subject, and as <br/>\nlong as she is learning things that have meaning to her personally, <br/>\nthat is what concerns me most.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t even going to mention it here, because it didn&#39;t sound <br/>\nunschoolish enough, but it made us both sit back and say HEY! This <br/>\nstuff works without all the stress and hassle. <br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\n<br/>\nPS world book&#39;s typical course of study: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.worldbook.com/parents/course_study_index.asp\">http://www2.worldbook.com/parents/course_study_index.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] help with proselytising","postDate":"1054675321","msgId":72003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMC5hZWVhMTk4LjJjMGU2Yjc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72002,"nextInTopic":72012,"prevInTime":72002,"nextInTime":72004,"topicId":72002,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/3/2003 3:12:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time, ...
