I&#39;m talking 60s here, as it was earlier<br/>\n&gt;feminists that gained the vote for women and the acceptance of<br/>\n&gt;women wearing trousers they were good things.    But on the down<br/>\n&gt;side the feminist movement has made women say such things as<br/>\n&gt;&quot;I&#39;m ONLY a housewife&quot; with shame instead of the pride women<br/>\n&gt;once felt in their role as wife and Mother.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Men and women are different and thank Mother Nature for that<br/>\n&gt;difference!   I can work as hard and as long as many men,<br/>\n&gt;especially since I can wear jeans and not be restricted by the type<br/>\n&gt;of garment I am wearing, but it sure feels good when working hard<br/>\n&gt;to have a pair of strong male arms there to help out with the real<br/>\n&gt;heavy stuff.   Most men are physically stronger and larger than<br/>\n&gt;most women, this is an inescapable fact, a fact which is driven<br/>\n&gt;home to me each time I work alongside my 15 year old son who<br/>\n&gt;just two years ago had the body and strength of a child.   To see<br/>\n&gt;the way he can lift things with one arm that I have to fight to move<br/>\n&gt;with both of mine reinforces that difference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In most cases the differences between male and female are<br/>\n&gt;complimentary, our strengths and weaknesses are often at<br/>\n&gt;opposite ends of the poles, so together can make a good team.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have been a SAHM Mom for many years, I have worked a few part<br/>\n&gt;time jobs [tupperware etc] especially in the earlier years.  The<br/>\n&gt;most important thing to me when deciding on what work I could do<br/>\n&gt;was to ensure that either my Mother or husband would be available<br/>\n&gt;to look after the children while I was working.  This was for little<br/>\n&gt;extras, my oldest son was really into computers and devoured<br/>\n&gt;books on the subject long before we had one, so I sold tupperware<br/>\n&gt;to buy a Commodore 64 for his use.  Now I guess I am sort of a<br/>\n&gt;working Mom, but the big difference is that I work at home so I am<br/>\n&gt;here if the kids need me, and another big bonus is that they can be<br/>\n&gt;involved and understand what I do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Summing up; for me feminism has given me the right to vote and<br/>\n&gt;wear jeans, however it has taken from me the chance to feel as<br/>\n&gt;though society values my role, if there is no $ value on it then it<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t seem to have a value.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Sue<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\n&gt;My website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\n&gt;Farm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\n&gt;Farm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it,<br/>\n&gt;  is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;GIVE YOUR WIFE A BREAK!

She raised strong <br/>\ndaughters who wouldn&#39;t take shit from men and they in turn did the <br/>\nsame.
