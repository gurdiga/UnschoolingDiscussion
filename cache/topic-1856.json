The<br/>\noldest was taught to read between 5-6, she gobbled it up and was reading<br/>\nfluently quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second child began learning at about 5.  He took it very slowly and<br/>\nrather privately.  He would use computer programs and ask questions.  By 6<br/>\nhe had lost interest and only sort of played around with letters/sounds,<br/>\nwith no real progress. He also didn&#39;t *get* phonics.  By 8 I wanted him to<br/>\nbe able to read, as he wanted to play computer and video games that needed<br/>\nsomeone to read to him.  Only this spring and summer, after he turned 9 in<br/>\nJanuary, did his reading take off.  Now you can&#39;t stop him, he&#39;s reading<br/>\neverything.  All I did was provide the computer games and paper and pencils.<br/>\nI also answered his questions and read to him a bit. (not a lot, just a<br/>\nbit).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy third child is doesn&#39;t even know his ABC&#39;s, couldn&#39;t care less, and has<br/>\nno plans to read anytime soon. He did cry tonight because his brother<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t read the directions to Pokemon Snapshot to him.  I don&#39;t see him<br/>\neven trying to read until much later.  Doing is this child&#39;s middle name. He<br/>\ntakes things apart, he builds things.  Sometimes he tries to rebuild what he<br/>\ntook apart, but not often.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 4th child is another daughter and she&#39;s actively asked for lessons.  She<br/>\nwas sorely disappointed that one 15 minute lesson didn&#39;t solve her desire to<br/>\nread fluently.  She&#39;s willing to play around with sounds and letters and<br/>\nwriting with me. She&#39;s absorbing things, but I have a clue as to when it<br/>\nwill click for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I would look for is frustration at not being able to read.  Is she<br/>\nshowing signs of wanting to read, or to be able to read fluently? Or is this<br/>\njust you??<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a great essay in the back of one of the Colfax books, _Hard Time in<br/>\nParadise_ I think. Of Daffodils and Diesels is the name of the essay.   It<br/>\ndiscusses the idea that when a child is reading for their information they<br/>\nare NOT actively figuring things out on their own. They are trusting a book<br/>\nto tell them about things.  Since your child is not reading, just what is<br/>\nshe doing with the time others spend reading? Aren&#39;t those things more<br/>\nappropriate for her at the moment?  My 7.5 year old who builds is working<br/>\nvery hard on understanding his world,  his physical world.

My 7yod does not<br/>\nyet read (much...she can read a few words).  I&#39;ve read many articles saying<br/>\nthings like: a) just keep reading to the child and s/he will learn to read.<br/>\nb) When s/he&#39;s ready,  she will read,  whether it&#39;s at age 4 or even as late<br/>\nas nine or ten.<br/>\nShe has excelled at all the pre-reading skills and many thought she would be<br/>\nreading by the time she was 5.<br/>\nThis is causing me some anxiety.... I want to enjoy her growth and learning,<br/>\nbut feel she can accomplish this.  I wonder if she needs to be challenged<br/>\nwith this?<br/>\nAny ideas,  thoughts on this?<br/>\nThanks all!<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1908,"nextTopicId":1935}}
