Porn  use—specifically Internet porn—<br/>\nis on the rise and is claiming a high price: lost  jobs, failed marriages, <br/>\nand destroyed families. Pastors and other Christian  leaders are no less <br/>\nvulnerable to this addiction (3/5 C. Today). In  August 1999, 11 percent of the calls <br/>\nreceived on Focus on the Family&#39;s Pastoral  Care Line were about pastors and <br/>\nonline porn. In August 2000, online porn  worries prompted 20 percent of the <br/>\ncalls. Almost 10 percent of calls are from  women. Many female sex addicts get <br/>\nhooked through X-rated chatrooms. Pornography  has become one of the most <br/>\nprofitable ventures on the Internet with obscene  profits soaring. <br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-15-2001.html_\">http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-15-2001.html_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-15-2001.html)\">http://home.hiwaay.net/~contendr/2001/3-15-2001.html)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\n(From &quot;Calvary Contender,&quot; a stupid site about stupidity, but still,  worth <br/>\nquoting on this, because IF pastors and Christian leaders are vulnerable  to <br/>\nthis &quot;addiction,&quot; there&#39;s something my teenagers have in their lives, some  <br/>\nstrength or wholeness, that those grown men with wives and children are wholly  <br/>\nmissing.)<br/>\n <br/>\n--------<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom Family Education <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyeducation.com/article/1,1120,5-17313,00.html_\">http://familyeducation.com/article/1,1120,5-17313,00.html_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyeducation.com/article/1,1120,5-17313,00.html)\">http://familyeducation.com/article/1,1120,5-17313,00.html)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nPart 2 of something I can&#39;t find Part 1 of.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-------------<br/>\n <br/>\n_MotheringDotCommune Forums - Internet Porn and teenage  boys_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com/discussions/showthread.php?t=232027&page=2)\">http://www.mothering.com/discussions/showthread.php?t=232027&page=2)</a>  <br/>\n    ...
