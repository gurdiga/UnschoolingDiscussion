How long <br/>\n&gt;has the practitioner actively been using homeopathy?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your best choice is the one that specializes in classical homeopathy and <br/>\n&gt;treats constitutionally.

Next... A real <br/>\n&gt;homeopath uses only homeopathy and does not try to sell you anything else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A homeopathic consultation takes about 1 to 1-and-a-half hours and is <br/>\n&gt;basically like an informal interview where you express your ailments, <br/>\n&gt;concerns and perceptions. The homeopath usually asks questions that <br/>\n&gt;cover physical, emotional and mental aspects, as well as other features <br/>\n&gt;of your personality (cravings, dreams, habits, etc.), along with your <br/>\n&gt;family&#39;s and your medical history and such. From the information s/he <br/>\n&gt;gathers s/he can find a remedy similar to what s/he perceives needs to <br/>\n&gt;be cured. There is no judgement whatsoever, it&#39;s more like finding clues <br/>\n&gt;to understand how you perceive the world as an individual. The <br/>\n&gt;homeopathic interview is therapeutic in itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then s/he gives you the remedy of choice and you come to the next <br/>\n&gt;follow-up about 3 to 4 weeks later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Many things  can happen after you take a constitutional remedy. It&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt;little bit like cleaning house... things shift, past emotions can come <br/>\n&gt;up, past physical symptoms come back temporarily, and anything that <br/>\n&gt;hasn&#39;t been resolved properly shows up for a brief period and gets <br/>\n&gt;finally resolved. Depending on the particular case and sensitivity of <br/>\n&gt;the person, there are subtle to major changes at all levels.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Homeopathy is based on the premise that your own vital force knows what <br/>\n&gt;is best for you. And the remedy&#39;s goal is to gently stimulate your own <br/>\n&gt;vital force so that it can restore harmony in te best possible way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I hope this helps.

When anyone held him,<br/>\nhe would reach up and twirl the hair around their neck. When he was younger<br/>\nit was always just twirling, either his or mine, usually when he wanted to<br/>\nfall asleep. Since last spring though he has progressed to actually pulling<br/>\nit out, had a huge bald spot (2 inches or so). We cut it really short over<br/>\nthe summer and that seemed to help but now he is back to pulling it out again.<br/>\nHe pulls at it without even thinking about it, kind of a nervous, calming habit.<br/>\nWe have tried lots of things, giving him alternatives, reminders etc. nothing <br/>\nreally seems to help much. Part of it is that he is not overly motivated to <br/>\nstop. It is a way that he internalizes stress, I think, so I have been trying<br/>\nto help him find other ways...progressive relaxation and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also has a slight bit of eczema on his arms that went away this summer (I think)<br/>\nthat is back now, so maybe a skin problem? I really don&#39;t know. But he has<br/>\nbeen doing this for about 6 years now and it seems to be progressing and getting worse.<br/>\nI just feel like something is off and he needs something but I don&#39;t know what.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"jaeschool","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids and behaviour","postDate":"1040269815","msgId":52322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZi4xZTE3YmMzNi4yYjMyOWJmN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52318,"nextInTopic":52324,"prevInTime":52321,"nextInTime":52323,"topicId":52278,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/18/02 10:19:18 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

My<br/>\n&gt; youngest has a temper (must be the red hair) and loses it quite<br/>\n&gt; often. When he does he will lash our at other kids if they approach<br/>\n&gt; him and adults too and call people who try and speak to him &#39;f****<br/>\n&gt; bastards&#39;<br/>\n&gt; At home I&#39;ve fiound the only thing that works is to ignore him until<br/>\n&gt; he comes out of the temper. He can&#39;t be reasoned with, or jollied<br/>\n&gt; out of it or even threatened (which I treid in the past). Punishment<br/>\n&gt; and consequences mean nothing while his temper lasts.<br/>\n&gt; When it has passed we&#39;ve discussed it many times and he<br/>\n&gt; promises to try better in the future. None of this is a problem at<br/>\n&gt; home.<br/>\n&gt; While we&#39;re out this is a different matter. One friend tried to jolly<br/>\n&gt; him out of a temper and he called her a name and tried to hit her.<br/>\n&gt; He hit another friends dog when the dog tried to pinch his dinner.<br/>\n&gt; We are finding that we&#39;re not welcome anywhere which is affecting<br/>\n&gt; my other kids and me. I feel we&#39;re going to be alone, stuck in the<br/>\n&gt; house like social pariahs.<br/>\n&gt; My friends use time out and sending kids to their room which I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t agree with personally but in their own house I would never say<br/>\n&gt; anything. While I tell him that his behaviour isn&#39;t acceptable I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; obviously not going to beat him and I feel uncomfortable dicsiplining<br/>\n&gt; him in a way I would not do so at home. I really don&#39;t want to be<br/>\n&gt; friendless until he matures enough to stop, like the other two did.<br/>\n&gt; In some ways it is a cultural thing too, peope at home would have<br/>\n&gt; ignored the behaviour or laughed it off as a stage some kids go<br/>\n&gt; through.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any advice in how to deal with a stubborn 7 yo would be<br/>\n&gt; apreciated. Before I have to leave Virginia ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shyrley<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.
