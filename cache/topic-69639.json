So maybe talk to him about summer-type things he&#39;d<br/>\nlike to accomplish like learning to swim better or a family bike trip to the<br/>\ntop of a local mountain or finding a great book series or watching all the<br/>\nJames Bond movies in chronological order.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for predictable days, perhaps you could write the days schedule down<br/>\nfor him so he knows what&#39;s happening that day.

I posted quite a bit in Jan and <br/>\n  Feb. Took a long hiatus when I had an Internet crisis. Since then, <br/>\n  I&#39;ve been the &quot;soccer&quot; mom times three with multiple kids in <br/>\n  sports and activities. We&#39;ve been unschooling in earnest since <br/>\n  January. And it&#39;s taken all my focus to make this transition from<br/>\n  a more traditional homeschooling approach. I check in here <br/>\n  mostly just reading when I find myself needing a pep talk.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve taken the last several weeks to read up on NCP and TCS. I <br/>\n  noticed on this list that it came up here briefly for discussion. <br/>\n  What is it about NCP that makes several of you say: &quot;Oh that is <br/>\n  definitely not what this list is about&quot;? What is different about how <br/>\n  most of you unschoolers parent and how NCP comes across?<br/>\n<br/>\n  The tone of our home has improved dramatically since January <br/>\n  in most areas. I&#39;ve seen our kids develop sibling harmony that <br/>\n  takes almost no help from me! That&#39;s been awesome. And they <br/>\n  seem to enjoy having more autonomy and control over their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But recently in a family conversation, there were a couple of <br/>\n  comments that I wanted to chew on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of our kids is not liking the loss of the homeschool lifestyle <br/>\n  that we used to have. He liked the predictability of the routine, the <br/>\n  fact that all the kids were on the same schedule and that the <br/>\n  family had a united course of study. He&#39;s come to tears several <br/>\n  times over this and wishes we were back to the way we were. He <br/>\n  likes a measurable goal that he can tick off. But when I <br/>\n  suggested returning to a course of study for him, he resists <br/>\n  since he&#39;s not sure it will feel &quot;real&quot; if he&#39;s the only one doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another one worried that she only cared about her friendships <br/>\n  and was disappointed in herself to find that she isn&#39;t getting <br/>\n  hooked on any &quot;interests.&quot; She thought that with the freedom to <br/>\n  explore anything she wanted to, she&#39;d find something that <br/>\n  hooked her. I&#39;m wondering if she is still judging her interests (as <br/>\n  though studying mythology--which she has loved in the past--is <br/>\n  somehow more worthy of her time and attention than her <br/>\n  friendships online and in person). After all, she has eight <br/>\n  international pen pals that she writes to all month, she&#39;s <br/>\n  completed a novella, has read three to five novels a week for <br/>\n  months, is redecorating her room using books on feng shui to <br/>\n  help her, and is studying Latin because &quot;she wants to.&quot; I&#39;m not <br/>\n  worried about her at all.
