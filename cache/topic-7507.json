I am very open to <br/>\nbeing a foster parent, but don&#39;t know how I would handle schooling. I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to send some to school and keep others at home, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow if I&#39;d be allowed to hs foster kids. I won&#39;t send my son to school and <br/>\nI&#39;m afraid it would cause conflicts if we had other children who had to go. <br/>\nThe foster children might resent my son for not having to go, and even my <br/>\nson might think he was missing something. Has anyone had any experience with <br/>\nthis? Any ideas?<br/>\n                                                 Trisha<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7501,"nextTopicId":7504}}
