I know a family where <br/>\nthe kids had lots of freedom at home (though they were in P.S. and <br/>\none dropped out at age 16) and their mom was really involved in their <br/>\nlives. As close to an unschooling atmosphere as possible, while still <br/>\nparticipating in the school system. Though they didn&#39;t have lots of <br/>\nstructure, they never rebelled. They&#39;re into a very cool hobby called <br/>\nDaggerhaus ??? where they do medieval fighting, making their armor <br/>\nand weapons by medieval techniques (blunted weapons). They&#39;re a bunch <br/>\nof pretty cool guys, self-confident, happy young men with jobs, etc. <br/>\nHeading into adulthood with what looks like a pretty good sense of <br/>\nthemselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also know a family where there&#39;s lots of structure, and the mom and <br/>\ndad are really involved in their lives, and their kids never rebelled <br/>\nbut have gone on to do some pretty cool stuff (like, earned a Mary <br/>\nKay car by age 21, for their oldest; position as a youth judge for <br/>\ntheir soon to graduate homeschooled 18 year old, etc.) They&#39;re a <br/>\nbunch of pretty cool kids, hard workers, friendly, self-confident and <br/>\nhappy, making lives for themselves (except the 11 year old who is <br/>\nstill being homeschooled) and going the directions that THEY want to <br/>\ngo. I&#39;m watching and waiting with that family, to a certain extent. <br/>\nWondering if there&#39;s a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; coming along for those kids, <br/>\nhaving a goal oriented, dynamic, energetic mom who guided them to <br/>\nalways try for the highest marks available. But so far, no rebellion <br/>\nin that family, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70316959,"authorName":"AimeeL73@cs.com","from":"AimeeL73@...","profile":"aimeels73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] article: Parents, Shopping for Discipline, Turn  to ...","postDate":"1052507374","msgId":68297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhMi4xNDcwOWI5OS4yYmVkNTZlZUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68309,"prevInTime":68296,"nextInTime":68298,"topicId":68297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1881741072\">&lt;&lt; I was half way through the second paragraph, above and the voice in my<br/>\n head was saying &quot;&lt;snip&gt; A youth who rises to Levels 4, 5 and 6 can<br/>\n become a...&quot; and I finished the sentence with &quot;become a Nazi&quot;.
