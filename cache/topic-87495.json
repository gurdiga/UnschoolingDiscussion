You just put it in the front pocket of guys underwear or girls who wont wear guys can were two pairs of girls undies.  You don&#39;t have to wait for it to go through the laundry it in-between so it&#39;s good for more then one wetting a night.  I like the idea with this kind as they don&#39;t alert the whole house and it is somewhat discreet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was young my mom bought a big mat version that went under your sheet and then literally &quot;SCARED THE LIVING PISS OUT OF YOU IT WAS SO LOUD&quot;  woke me up did the trick of making my brain wake me up when my bladder was full.  The problem was it scared me so badly I would literally be unable to sleep for hours if it was on the bed and then when I did wake to use to bathroom I&#39;d jump bolt upright in bed and run scared that the thing might go off.  I still kept my sleeping through anything ability fire alarms, neibors knocking on my door because of fire, land lord using master key and coming into my room to wake me up, slept in landlords car while firemen threw smoking mattress out of top floor apartment desmoked the building and then with sirens blaring when to another fire.  Then I had kids and wake much more easily.  Anyway the humiliation of wetting the bed was far more severe then that *@%*@ alarm.<br/>\nTeresa in Canada<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: zenmomma2kids <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, January 02, 2004 1:49 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Night wetting was Re: Unschooling and potty training<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;She decided she wanted to try the alarm underpants and so I got <br/>\n  them for her.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hmmm...so these were vibrating underpants you say.

I think<br/>\nhe was embarrassed as the bed I peed was his sister&#39;s while were just 4<br/>\nhouses over visiting them.
