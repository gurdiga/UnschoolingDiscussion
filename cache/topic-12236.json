I have a 10 year old and 13 year old and am curious&nbsp;\n&nbsp;about what you all think, unschooling-wise, about: 1)SET TIMES FOR BED vs.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;ANYTIME IS OKAY...same with rising time. 2)Use of the computer/internet:&nbsp;\n&nbsp;SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT? 3)Last year, we homeschooled with a curriculum from&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Oak Meadow. We did the Saxon Math lessons everyday...after lots of coercing.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;They both learned alot inspite of resistance. Now we are unschooling (again)&nbsp;\n&nbsp;and I am having trouble just LETTING GO of math...I doubt that they are ever&nbsp;\n&nbsp;going to choose to do it on their own...the stuff they were learning, we&nbsp;\n&nbsp;will probably never come across naturally (multiplying fractions, algebra,&nbsp;\n&nbsp;etc.)so, what happens if they want to take an SAT test later; I guess they&nbsp;\n&nbsp;just have to &quot;knuckle down&quot; and learn lots of math all at once THEN? I think&nbsp;\n&nbsp;I need a pep talk.</pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br>I was happy to read that so many of you do not have bedtimes. I\nhave 2 daughters same age (10) and one goes to bed on her own at about\n8:30.\n<br>The other stays up until I go to bed. But I also discovered that late\nat night is when she does her best writing and asks me for math problems\nto do. We have always unschooled but also have workbooks available. They\nsit on the shelf just as the coloring and craft books do. One loves to\ndo them. The other hates to do them. The one that loves them is poor in\nmath. The one who hates the workbooks and never uses them excels in math.\nShe does it all in her head. She hates to write, but makes up poems and\nstories and recites them to me. Tell her it is very good and she might\nwant to write that down she will say, &quot;No thanks.&quot;\n<p>This year we purchased our first curriculum, Oak Meadow. I like it,\nbut use it loosely. They have some really neat ideas in it that I might\nnot think of doing that are fun and the kids love it. I also like the use\nof the Recorder as we were not doing any music before Oak Meadow. We used\na borrowed one for 3rd grade last year and actually did everything in it.\nI just don&#39;t worry about what we are supposed to do in certain weeks. But\nat the end of school year I went over it and realized we had actually covered\nit all or already knew or were involved in these things.\n<p>Oak Meadow no longer uses Saxon Math. They made up their own math which\nis much more unschool-friendly. Multiplying fractions we learned in cooking.\nWe are not up to Algebra yet but I am sure they will have a way to use\nit that is unschool-friendly.\n<br>We learned Roman Numerals last year in one quick lesson the Oak Meadow\nway.\n<p>The computer was a big deal when we first got it, but they use it just\nthe right amount IMO. I use it too much. For someone with a &quot;Kill your\nTelevision&quot; bumper sticker on my car you would think I would not sit at\nthis thing so long.\n<p>Chow,\n<br>Judy\n<br>&nbsp;</p></span></blockquote></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12234,"nextTopicId":12239}}
