So awkward, that a friend of <br/>\nours told us a story involving their son at the local elementary <br/>\nschool that was part of the reason for pulling their son out of the <br/>\nschool.  The teacher was demanding the term ma&#39;am when answering yes <br/>\nor no, but the son didn&#39;t use it at home either.

I just wanted to interject an empathetic thump on the back, <br/>\nalong with a recommendation. Don&#39;t consider this &quot;the wrong place.&quot; If you <br/>\nwant to change how you think about education, parenting, relationships with <br/>\nyour kids and others...then stick around. Read a LOT. Read an article or a <br/>\nthread, then read some more. Read at the unschooling.com forum. I don&#39;t know <br/>\nthe URL for that one, but it&#39;s got lots of good stuff, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnow that many people come to visit here, and get a feeling of &quot;woah! nelly&quot; <br/>\nat the plethora of responses to questions, etc. This happened to me when I <br/>\nfirst started reading here, two years or so ago. And I must say, I&#39;m a <br/>\ndifferent person than I was back then. I also know more about what <br/>\nunschooling is. My off-the-cuff, knee jerk impression of unschooling was <br/>\nthat it is a completely and totally hands-off approach, with objective, <br/>\nuninvolved parents, and no interaction between parent and child. The image I <br/>\nhad in my mind was one of kids out of control while parents pulled their <br/>\nhair out, wondering what to do, because &quot;Oh, no! what can we do? we can&#39;t <br/>\ntell them how to behave! they want to do this, and we can&#39;t do a thing about <br/>\nit! oh, no!&quot; That isn&#39;t it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nwith unschooling, the parent is sort of like a guide. An observant, <br/>\ninterested, involved guide, helping the kids take on their world, without <br/>\nputting up barriers that needn&#39;t be there. Need there be barriers? Well, <br/>\nyeah. They have to live in a world where some behaviors are frowned upon. <br/>\nSwearing for example. It&#39;s entirely possible to allow any language inside <br/>\nthe family, while giving the kids guidance about how the world thinks about <br/>\ncertain types of language. So, the barrier would be along the lines of &quot;by <br/>\nthe way, most adults don&#39;t like it when kids say shit.&quot; or perhaps defining <br/>\na word. I have a friend whose boys started using the term &quot;gay wad&quot; left and <br/>\nright. Pre-teens. She explained what that term actually meant, without <br/>\ntelling them they couldn&#39;t say such things, and... they stopped using that <br/>\nterm.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, anyway. Don&#39;t ditch. Even if you don&#39;t post, do continue to read. And <br/>\nDO continue to ask questions. It&#39;s pretty average for a newbie to throw a <br/>\nfew things into the mix, and get PLENTY of responses, that might make you <br/>\nfeel defensive. This list tells it like it is, and doesn&#39;t mince words, and <br/>\nhas lots of wisdom and warmth (and some heat!) If you keep on absorbing, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll &quot;get&quot; the flavor of the place, and come to appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings, HeidiC (a different Heidi)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I&#39;m just the new guy asking some questions.

It&#39;s not my intent, but I <br/>\n&gt;reserve the<br/>\n&gt;right to screw up now and then. Perhaps I&#39;m in the wrong place. I see now <br/>\n&gt;that this is for<br/>\n&gt;discussion.
