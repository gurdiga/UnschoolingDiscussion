Ahmed-Ullah<br/>\nTribune staff reporter<br/>\nMay 16, 2001<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, home-schoolers startled the educational establishment when<br/>\nthey swept the top three places<br/>\nin the prestigious Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee, nailing words<br/>\nsuch as &quot;phrontistery&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;sphingine.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a week earlier, home-schoolers took four of the top 10 spots at the<br/>\nnational geography bee.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis month, students who are taught at home -- just 2 percent of all<br/>\nschool-age children -- will again<br/>\nmake up more than 10 percent of the national spelling bee&#39;s participants<br/>\nand an even higher proportion<br/>\nat the National Geographic Bee, sponsored by the National Geographic<br/>\nSociety.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir success is no accident. Parents who home-school, often on the<br/>\ndefensive about the quality of<br/>\neducation they provide, are looking to these contests for vindication.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome are spending thousands of dollars on specialized dictionaries,<br/>\natlases and computer programs,<br/>\nand untold hours training their children for these high-profile proving<br/>\ngrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nCritics argue that teaching to compete successfully in bees is more<br/>\nabout gamesmanship than lasting<br/>\neducational achievement. But in a climate that puts a premium on the<br/>\nresults of standardized tests, the<br/>\nbees give home-schoolers their own flashy scorecards to show the rest of<br/>\nthe world.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Clearly it makes a point that home-schooled parents can do the job,&quot;<br/>\nsaid Richard Jefferson,<br/>\nspokesman for the Home School Legal Defense Association. &quot;For years,<br/>\npeople were not convinced that<br/>\nhome-schoolers were really up to the job of teaching our own children.<br/>\nSo we&#39;ve had to fight extensively<br/>\nin the public arena just to make sure people understood that we can do<br/>\nit. If another school system<br/>\nproduced winners, what would they say? They would say, &#39;See our school<br/>\nsystem works.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHome-schoolers in the Chicago area have four of their own spelling bees,<br/>\nwhose winners go on to<br/>\ncompete with schoolchildren in higher rounds. The geography bees have a<br/>\nsimilar structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMom starts a bee<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura Yates of Antioch started a home-school spelling bee in Lake County<br/>\nafter hearing about a<br/>\nhome-schooler winning the national competition in 1997. For her, it was<br/>\na way to offer her children<br/>\nacademic competition.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, she has amassed a library of books on word stems and<br/>\netymology and thick dictionaries to<br/>\nhelp find difficult terms. She has fed her kids&#39; appetite for new words<br/>\nby visiting bees at neighboring<br/>\nschools and purchasing word games on compact disc or tapes with strange<br/>\npronunciations of equally<br/>\ncurious-looking terms found in the Scripps Howard paideia, the spellers&#39;<br/>\nbible of 3,600 words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with math on the living room couch, science at the lake in their<br/>\nback yard and gym on a neighbor&#39;s<br/>\ntrampoline, the Yates children have spent five to eight hours a day<br/>\nlearning to decipher obscure<br/>\nspellings.<br/>\n<br/>\nLindsey, 15, qualified for the nationals last year, finishing 118th.<br/>\nElliott, 13, came in third at the Chicago<br/>\nTribune&#39;s suburban spelling bee in March. They both attribute it to<br/>\nhome-schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It gives you so much freedom,&quot; Lindsey said. &quot;If I was in school, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how I&#39;d study for it because<br/>\nI&#39;d be so worn out with homework and sports. It allows me to focus in on<br/>\nsomething I enjoy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda Bolt, of South Bend, Ind., has created flash cards and stuck word<br/>\nlists on windows and mirrors<br/>\nthroughout the house to help her son, Erik, 13, study for the spelling<br/>\nbee. She entered him in the<br/>\ngeography bee after learning about a home-schooler winning it in 1999<br/>\nand reading about the bees in a<br/>\nhome-schooling magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, the national geography bee, with a $25,000 scholarship at<br/>\nstake, will be held in Washington,<br/>\nD.C. Tuesday and May 23. The national spelling bee, with its $10,000<br/>\nprize, will be held May 29 through<br/>\n31.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome-schoolers reached the nationals of the spelling bee for the first<br/>\ntime in 1992, and 27 did it last<br/>\nyear. This year, 25 of the 248 competitors are home-schooled. The<br/>\ngeography bee started seeing<br/>\nsimilar trends in the mid-1990s. A record eight home-schoolers are among<br/>\n55 eligible contestants this<br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\nImage-conscious<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years, the Home School Legal Defense Association has helped<br/>\nimprove the public&#39;s image of<br/>\nan estimated 1.2 million home-schoolers across the nation by emphasizing<br/>\nhigh standardized test<br/>\nscores. A 1998 study commissioned by the association showed that<br/>\nchildren taught at home typically<br/>\nscore between the 70th and 80th percentiles in national tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe association also highlights the bee results, which Penny Beihl of<br/>\nSaluda, S.C. -- a former private<br/>\nelementary school teacher -- believes are important to changing public<br/>\nperception.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ll be checking out of a store and people will ask the kids, &#39;Where do<br/>\nyou go to school? And they find out<br/>\nand say, &#39;How do you know they&#39;re learning anything?&#39;&quot; she said.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeihl grills her sons daily on world facts and has compiled a<br/>\ngeography-version of the &quot;20 Questions&quot;<br/>\ngame for the dinner table. Her son, David, 15, won the national<br/>\ngeography bee in 1999, and now her<br/>\nsecond son, Tommy, 13, will be in the national spelling and geography<br/>\nbees this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think obviously they must be learning something,&quot; Beihl said. &quot;This<br/>\nis my job. If my (son) wants to do it,<br/>\nI&#39;m going to help him achieve it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA little Greek, Latin<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids often drive the process. George Thampy of suburban St. Louis,<br/>\nthe 2000 spelling bee champ,<br/>\ndeveloped his own list of 3,000 words from dictionaries and via Internet<br/>\nWeb sites. He dabbled in a little<br/>\nGreek and Latin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 13-year-old also came in second in the geography bee last year. This<br/>\nyear, his sister, Mallika, 12,<br/>\nwill be in the national spelling bee.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think one of the obvious benefits of a home-school education versus<br/>\nany other trend is you can focus<br/>\non specific needs and interests in your education,&quot; said Paige Kimble,<br/>\ndirector of the Scripps Howard<br/>\nNational Spelling Bee. &quot;Children in other types of schooling follow a<br/>\nset program regardless of whether<br/>\nthey are interested or need that program.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic educators don&#39;t think the bee victories mean much.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think they can prove that home-schooling is a viable alternative<br/>\nwithout using that as an example,&quot; said<br/>\nPaul Houston, executive director of the American Association of School<br/>\nAdministrators. &quot;If I was in<br/>\nthe home-schooling movement, I&#39;d say, is that the way you want kids to<br/>\nspend their time, sitting around<br/>\nall day and memorizing lists of spelling words or facts.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Education is not &#39;The Weakest Link&#39; or &#39;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.&#39;<br/>\nYou&#39;re not an educated<br/>\nperson because you can memorize pages of esoteric words. That&#39;s why you<br/>\nhave spell check on<br/>\nyour computer.&quot; Jefferson dismisses the criticism. &quot;What is wrong with<br/>\nmemorizing?&quot; he said. &quot;How<br/>\nelse do we learn Spanish or another foreign language? How else do I know<br/>\nhow to drive? Memorizing,<br/>\nwe all do it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\nCheck it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
