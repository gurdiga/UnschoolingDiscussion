 my husband&#39;s name is <br/>\nseth.  he lived for a while during his youth in el paso, TX, which has a <br/>\nlarge hispanic community.  lots of kids in his class couldn&#39;t say his <br/>\nname at all<br/>\n(we had this experience come up recently with a friend of mine&#39;s <br/>\npanamanian husband) since they don&#39;t have the *th* sound in spanish.  he <br/>\nwould try to help them by explaining that it sounds like *thirsty* in <br/>\nspanish *sed* or some-such, and that was close enough.  so he was called <br/>\nthirsty. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think it&#39;s sweet and will miss hearing those &quot;mer-dwifs&quot; <br/>\n&gt;someday.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>mmhmm!  my daughter called her baby brother *some-bas-chun* instead of <br/>\nsebastian for quite some time...way cute.  by the time he got around to <br/>\nreferring to himself, we&#39;d already shortened it to sebby, much easier to <br/>\nsay!  i kinda feel bad that he has such a long name to figure out, while <br/>\nhis big sis got 2 letters *eve*, and his baby sis 3 *lila*...lol.  which <br/>\nthen reminds me of a cute bit on sesame street with a whole bunch of <br/>\nschool kids singing a song about their names.  there&#39;s the typical <br/>\nnames, then last of all is this adorable boy, grinning so big and he <br/>\nsays, *thelonius!*  adorable. :)  i still smile when i think about that!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Liz (&quot;Lizzie the Lezzie&quot;) Holaday (&quot;Holaday Inn&quot;, &quot;Happy Holadays&quot;)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>see the lizzie the lezzie thing i could see (poor you!), but the holiday <br/>\nones are just plain goofy!
