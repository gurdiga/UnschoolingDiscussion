I had no idea WHY the people were famous <br/>\nwho were on the panel, but that&#39;s how it was with most celebrity panels--I <br/>\nwas too young to know what they had done before Hollywood Squares or whatever.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a few things on there that were really &quot;educational&quot; for me--one <br/>\nwas a mountain climber, and they were asking really good questions of him about <br/>\nthe realities of high altitude stuff and climbing gear, and one of the false <br/>\nline-up guys was really hesitant.   All the others had quick answers, but that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean TRUE answers.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun for me not only to hear the trivia and see that (in those days <br/>\nmore easily than now) someone could be pretty famous and still have an unknown   <br/>\nface and voice, but it was fun to see how people moved and acted and how their <br/>\neyes were when they were nervous, faking/acting, puzzled, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest to a home game of this for us has been playing dictionary, where <br/>\npeople make up dictionary definitions, and they&#39;re all read by whoever&#39;s &quot;it.&quot; <br/>\n  It&#39;s only a pale version, because the person who is &quot;it&quot; gets more points <br/>\nif you don&#39;t pick the true definition (and she knows which one is the true one) <br/>\nso she needs to try to read all the others convincingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut &quot;What&#39;s My Line,&quot; where people made money if they could bluff the <br/>\npanelists to choose them, was really a fascinationg set-up.    Very cool that it&#39;s <br/>\nstill being shown some!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Everything we&#39;re learning from the Game Show channel","postDate":"1132583260","msgId":110112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEwLjMzZjc3ZmE4LjMwYjMzMzVjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":110114,"prevInTime":110111,"nextInTime":110113,"topicId":110112,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have I mentioned we love Tivo?

Certainly for being able to easily stop  stuff <br/>\nwe&#39;re watching and to record stuff we want, but also because Tivo loves us  <br/>\nand gives us interesting gifts.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor some reason, Tivo chose an episode of What&#39;s my Line, a REALLY old  <br/>\ngameshow, for us at one point. Julian suggested we watch it, and now we have it  on <br/>\nauto-record.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a really simple show. The panel asks yes or no questions to determine  <br/>\nthe occupation of a guest contestant. The shows we&#39;re watching now were made in <br/>\n the early 60&#39;s. But it&#39;s SO interesting!!!! And all three of us, including <br/>\n16  year old Julian, sit and watch every one.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome stuff we&#39;ve learned (partially from the show itself, and partially  <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s led us to lots of googling):<br/>\nThe panelists are very sophisticated and intelligent. Think NPR&#39;s Wait,  <br/>\nWait, Don&#39;t Tell me. They dress in formal wear (GORGEOUS clothes!). The regulars  <br/>\nare Arlene Francis, a really warm, funny actress, Dorothy Kilgallen, a  <br/>\njournalist, and Bennet Cerf, who was the publisher who ran Random House. The  host <br/>\nis John Daly. They have a fourth panelist, who changes, and occasional  other <br/>\nguest panelists.<br/>\n <br/>\nDorothy Kilgallen was a very successful journalist who died under very  <br/>\nmysterious circumstances, possibly related to the deaths of Kennedy and Marilyn  <br/>\nMonroe.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt one point they had a contestant who was a black criminal court judge in  <br/>\nNYC in the 60&#39;s. I googled him, and it turned out that later he became one of  <br/>\nthe first black cabinet members under Nixon, and ran HUD. He eventually left  <br/>\nthat position under scandal.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s tons more (including seeing some very famous celebrities when they  <br/>\nwere extremely young...like Dick Van Dyke when he was starring in Bye, Bye  <br/>\nBirdie on Broadway), but it seems like such a cool way to learn all kinds of  <br/>\nstuff, and the three of us have just been eating this up.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAh, Television and a net-wired laptop... who needs school?<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nCome to the  Northeast Unschooling Conference, Memorial Day Weekend, May <br/>\n26-28, 2006 in  Peabody, Massachusetts!  www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110110,"nextTopicId":109791}}
