There is that can be done to help your son from an alternative medicine standpoint., whether he has hyperinsulinemia or not.  While M.D.&#39;s like Dr. Rapp or allergists with an alternative bent are helpful, they are not as able to address the &quot;whole&quot; person as an integrative practice with naturopaths, chiropractors, M.D.&#39;s, reflexologists, dentists, massage therapists, etc.  There are non-invasive tests that can pinpoint with amazing accuracy specific organs or areas of the body that are imbalanced - and then corrected with dietary measures or Bach flower essences or other holistic methods.  I know of a woman at one of these clinics who was able to stop antidepressants after 12 years of use.  I have found the N. D. (naturopath) much better able to address our quest for health than any M.D.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe symptoms you describe of your son&#39;s recent behavior sounds just like the way my daughters and I act when we have low blood sugar.  Easy to cry, throw things, do not accept simple solutions/suggestions.  Try taking a food diary again - for at least a month - even if you&#39;ve done it before.  If it has been a few hours since a good solid meal (not a junky or sugary one) or if the behavior follows the ingestion of fruit, juice, or other sugars, you may have a hypoglycemic response.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20714,"nextTopicId":20797}}
