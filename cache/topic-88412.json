By the way, she wants to be a vet someday specializing in equine <br/>\nmedicine. She lives her life in total_freedom.<br/>\n  If you feel she would be an interesting subject just let us know. <br/>\n  We enjoyed the Conference so much last year and are looking forward to this <br/>\nyears as well. We are now planning all vacations around this event!!!<br/>\n                              Kimberly<br/>\n                  <br/>\n                    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88384,"nextTopicId":88419}}
