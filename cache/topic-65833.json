A writer must learn to deepen characters, trim<br/>\n&gt; writing, intensify scenes. To fall in love with a first draft to the<br/>\n&gt; point where one cannot change it is to greatly enhance the prospects<br/>\n&gt; of never publishing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Richard North Patterson<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Books aren&#39;t written--they&#39;re rewritten. Including your own. It is<br/>\n&gt; one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh<br/>\n&gt; rewrite hasn&#39;t quite done it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Michael Crichton<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;There is no great writing, only great rewriting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Justice Brandeis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;There is a difference between a book of two hundred pages from the<br/>\n&gt; very beginning, and a book of two hundred pages which is the result<br/>\n&gt; of an original eight hundred pages. The six hundred are there. Only<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t see them.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Elie Wiesel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The beautiful part of writing is that you don&#39;t have to get it right<br/>\n&gt; the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. You can always do it<br/>\n&gt; better, find the exact word, the apt phrase, the leaping simile.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Robert Cormier<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to<br/>\n&gt; please everyone.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Bill Cosby<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;To avoid criticism do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Elbert Hubbard<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is<br/>\n&gt; for other people.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Thomas Mann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What no wife of a writer can ever understand is that a writer is<br/>\n&gt; working when he&#39;s staring out the window.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Rudolph Erich Rascoe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Be anything you want to be, but don&#39;t be dull.&quot; ~Frank Robinson<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You can take for granted that people know more or less what a<br/>\n&gt; street, a shop, a beach, a sky, an oak tree look like.
