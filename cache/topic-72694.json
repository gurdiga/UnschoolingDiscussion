I&#39;m so miffed, I&#39;d like to pull apart some of her rant!  The opinions of the hubby aren&#39;t necessarily the wife&#39;s!!!  :O))<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As one of my favorite professors used to say, &quot;I only have<br/>\n&gt;to smell perfume to know a woman&#39;s been in the room.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Doubt that the knowing of something from use of nose can be directly correlated with what she thinks she knows.  There are tonnes of assumptions behind her assertion.  Obvious assumptions - what do **I** smell?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Exposure to negative elements in<br/>\n&gt;life can provide some immunity for children down the road, when they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt;on their own -- much the same way that exposure to certain viruses, etc.,<br/>\n&gt;provides defenses against further attack.  How is a child to learn to<br/>\n&gt;tolerate frustration if mommy and daddy never allow frustration in<br/>\n&gt;his/her life?  The ability to handle frustration is one of the gifts we<br/>\n&gt;possess as humans, but it&#39;s a skill that needs to be honed, as with any<br/>\n&gt;other skill.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Another case against vaccination!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Delaying gratification is another very necessary &quot;skill&quot; we<br/>\n </span></blockquote>need to teach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents stopped ruling my life in 1978 and I&#39;m still learning to delay gratification - the teacher is the Big World.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Allowing children -- who are not just little adults --<br/>\n </span></blockquote>free rein over absolutely everything that affects their lives is doing<br/>\nthem a great disservice.  It&#39;s hedonism gone berserk!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHedonism is the 100% pursuit of pleasure.  My kids aren&#39;t doing that in the least - they often work hard to pursue the painful because they must.  They simply must.  Like ds who plays soccer with endocrine issues that make him slow, and painful in his feet.  Hedonism, my butt!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Whatever happened to children needing boundaries?  How can anyone, in good conscience, allow children to choose their own boundaries <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You mean like boundaries that say an adult cannot exile them to a workbook from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and when not at a desk, defending their bodies against some bully.  Ya, ask me about boundaries, lady!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n You all just seem to be feeding off of each other with no clear<br/>\ndirection.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust like they do at AA, I think!  Is tht a cult too?  How many lives has AA saved???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s good -- to a point.  If I hadn&#39;t insisted when my kids were younger on their<br/>\nparticipating in certain events, taking up certain activities, etc., they<br/>\nnever would have discovered their true interest in those activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe their true interest is keeping Mommy happy - depends on the conseq&#39;s they get from NOT participating in things they don&#39;t like - I call it the Cult of Rabid Soccer Moms.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis extreme position I&#39;m seeing here, which you define as &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>\nis looking more and more like laziness to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCome clean my house - I could use the help &#39;cause I&#39;m doing it 24/7.  Laziness?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet the kid play video<br/>\ngames all day, what the hell -- I&#39;ll just read this book I&#39;ve wanted to<br/>\nread, or watch my soaps, blah, blah. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, I&#39;ll study algebra, the highly useful and often used talent EVERYONE wants to do over and over and over.  As opposed to learning to program in C++ from playing a fun game like Doom or Diablo.  Talk to a programmer about WHY they got into it.  Games, games, games.  Math was a hoop they jumped.<br/>\n<br/>\ngot a cult thing going on here, and you&#39;re convinced you&#39;re doing the right thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo is being unsure the ultimate goal, if I&#39;m wrong to be convinced?  I am so convinvced I went out an found this group.  Cults find the weak and UNSURE and convinvce them to join.  We roust people.  Hardly comparable.  They seem to run away, freely, as she did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI shudder to think of a future world populated by unschooled automatons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAutomatically going to school/work.  Automatically having 6 after work.  Automatically using violence to get your way.  The consequences of unrealised dreams and parenting from hell.  Hope she doesn&#39;t perpetuate it.  Really.  :O(<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t bother to reply...I can&#39;t wait to click on UNSUBSCRIBE...<br/>\n<br/>\nGOOD - I&#39;ll RANT!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
