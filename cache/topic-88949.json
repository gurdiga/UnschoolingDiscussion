This paragraph stood <br/>\nout:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What was his lesson in all of this drilling and sawing and sanding? Was <br/>\nthere a lesson for me as well? Who dare put a value on it? There will be no <br/>\nportfolio material produced with this lesson. The project will probably not even <br/>\nrate precious display case status for very long, because there are always so <br/>\nmany of these projects and we have many children doing them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me think of all the times these past few years that I have wrestled <br/>\nwith myself to let go of wanting to record each moment like this. All the <br/>\nlittle self initiated projects my kids start, some get finished, some don&#39;t. All <br/>\nthe while they are learning, geesh, I even start to dislike that word sometimes, <br/>\nall the while they are doing what?  How do we describe just living and <br/>\nfollowing ones heart? All the while that is going on I too have a lesson going on, <br/>\nthat of watching and enjoying and learning that not everything along the path <br/>\nhas to be photographed or put in a scrapbook for some reviewer down the road. <br/>\nThere will be enough to present to the reviewer at the end of the year and <br/>\nsomething&#39;s are just meant to be done for their own sake. To be enjoyed for that <br/>\ntime and not to worry what anyone is getting out of it. I have been learning to <br/>\ncalm myself down to let living happen. Just daily living, trusting and moving <br/>\non.<br/>\nLaura Buoni<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88843,"nextTopicId":88892}}
