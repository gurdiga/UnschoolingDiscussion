For the most part there weren&#39;t too many wierd <br/>\nrules, but one of them was at snack time, you had to taste everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there was this one kid who ALWAYS resisted trying vegetables. He would <br/>\nsit there, missing out on playing, not crying (we probably would have gotten <br/>\nhow stupid this rule was if he had), but just sitting there, FOREVER. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally he would taste the thing, announce he LOVED it, and ask for more. <br/>\nThen the next time the same thing would happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree. Lame rule.
