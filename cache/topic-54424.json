She begins chemotherapy <br/>\ntomorrow for brain and lung tumors, and so came up from Florida for to see <br/>\neveryone before she gets really sick.  Everyone came, because of her special <br/>\nstatus (they&#39;ve given her less than 6 months, and a couple of those are <br/>\nalready gone).  So I spent my birthday hugging and being hugged on by lots of <br/>\npeople I haven&#39;t seen in ages, and some I just saw in November at my <br/>\ngrandmother&#39;s 97th birthday party.  Aunt Linda remembered my birthday and <br/>\ntold everyone about it, and so everyone wished me a happy one when I hugged <br/>\nthem.  When I hugged Betty Ann for the last time before we left, I almost <br/>\nburst into tears, which would have really ruined the joyful mood.  So I <br/>\nreached down and stuck both hands in a cooler full of ice water.  It didn&#39;t <br/>\nwork very well, but nobody noticed, and just thought I was looking for a cold <br/>\ndrink.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe stayed for several hours, then went to some friend&#39;s house and visited <br/>\nwith them and then drove the 200 miles back home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got home at midnight and I didn&#39;t get any physical birthday presents <br/>\n(because we are going to Vegas on Thursday for our anniversary/mybirthday).  <br/>\nBut I sure got a lot of love yesterday!  And now here&#39;s some more.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Happy Birthday, Tuck!","postDate":"1042340411","msgId":54424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzLjJhNGUxMGVjLjJiNTIzNDNiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":54547,"prevInTime":54423,"nextInTime":54425,"topicId":54424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Happy Birthday, Tuck!
