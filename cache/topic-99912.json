She did disapoint me on one count however. She got that vase with the Betta fish and the lily. They&#39;re sold on the gimmick that the lily with keep the water clean by using the nitrites the betta produces and the betta will blissfully nibble on the roots for food. But bettas are carnivores and so will likely barely survive or die. And... A plant that practically plugs the surface of the water does not allow for oxygen to travel through the water&#39;s surface into the water. A betta can live in water with very little oxygen because it can go to the surface and gulp air but not if the surface is blocked by roots. Nevermind the poor betta has barely any space (okay, my little guy is in a bowl but as soon as we get a big tank for the two goldfish, Rainbow will be in his glory in a 10 gallon tank) but he&#39;s living in a deathtrap.

She<br/>\n&gt; insulted the father and told him he wasn&#39;t a parent, but a  &quot;friend&quot; <br/>\n&gt; to their<br/>\n&gt; kids.  She made him put the 2 yo to bed at 8:00 p.m., and  of course <br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sleepy and cried her eyes out.  To his credit he let  her out <br/>\n&gt; of the bed and<br/>\n&gt; that didn&#39;t happen again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; By the end of the show, the uptight family was having food fights in <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; kitchen with the fun mom, and the dad, who had been required to play <br/>\n&gt; his jazz<br/>\n&gt; guitar with headphones on because his wife always insisted on quiet, <br/>\n&gt; got up in a<br/>\n&gt;  restuarant and played his guitar with the band.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That woman was SUCH a great influence on the uptight family.
