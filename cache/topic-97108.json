My son is a <br/>\nbarometer of me. When I am tense, worried, aggitated, hungary, tired, <br/>\netc. he keys up a notch and starts clinging, whining, or seeking to <br/>\ndistract me from whatever he perceives to be bothering mama. He is so <br/>\nperceptive of my emotions, more so than I am even, that he is a <br/>\nlittle mirror for me to learn about myself. He is so acutely in tune <br/>\nwith me that it is very unsettling for him when I am unsettled, even <br/>\na little bit. I am amazed at his ability to read me. He is <br/>\nNOT &quot;acting out&quot;; he is calling out for the calm mama. He will even <br/>\nstart saying &quot;little baby needs his mama&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I realized that my peace is powerful to our calmness as a family. <br/>\nI know that his reactions are a cue to recenter myself. As he has <br/>\ngrown older, he uses his words more to show me myself. When he was <br/>\nyounger, he used his actions too: hitting, grabbing, even biting a <br/>\nfew times. I have learned that these are his calls for help to <br/>\nresettle our home. He wants a happy home as much as I do. But I do <br/>\nhave much more ability to break the cycle of harmony and disharmony <br/>\nas the adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I will stop, kneel down to his level, hold or hug him and <br/>\nwhisper. Then he knows I am calmer, he is able to rely on me to help <br/>\nhim and he can move on. It is very disturbing to have the mama out of <br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning not to be a type A, it doesn&#39;t work well for us as a <br/>\nfamily. Mama needs to be peace for the family to be peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; I hear this voice in my head, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?
