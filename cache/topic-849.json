I wrote up a &quot;learning plan&quot; for Nicholas<br/>\nlast year after our holiday to the Rockies.  This was not<br/>\nrequired but it was a fun exercise.  I put down things the kids<br/>\nhad spontaneously done already - before, during and after the<br/>\nholiday - which I thought could be presented in the kind of form<br/>\nwhich would, as you say, &quot;look good&quot;.  Every once in awhile I do<br/>\nthis and stash it in a folder in case some disgruntled neighbour<br/>\nthinks we&#39;re not providing a suitable educational program. I&#39;ve<br/>\ndone this writing up excercise when the kids were deeply involved<br/>\nin their &quot;Redwall&quot; phase, during our Shakespearean productions,<br/>\nduring baseball season, etc. I&#39;ll paste the trip example below<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s shortest.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(Please note that if we had actually written this up before the<br/>\ntrip and asked the kids to do these things, they probably never<br/>\nwould have covered half of this stuff.)  <br/>\n <br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\nBC Travel Unit STudy Plan<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore the Trip:  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Map routes and estimate travel time; mileage; gas expense<br/>\n-Read up on attractions and seasonal things to do <br/>\n-Prioritize wish list for itinerary<br/>\n<br/>\n(Involves reading for information, math, geography, personal<br/>\nplanning)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Road:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Note terrain in relation to roads<br/>\n-Note where routes follow course of rivers<br/>\n-Note wildlife sightings and what type of habitat where spotted<br/>\n-Note changes in vegetation<br/>\n-Play the &quot;licence plate game&quot; to keep track of where people came<br/>\nfrom to get to where we are<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the Trip:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Check travel times, mileage and cost of travel against estimates<br/>\n-Look up location of license plates spotted on the map.  <br/>\n-Which cars were from farthest away in each direction?  <br/>\n-Did we see cars from more places than we did on our trip to<br/>\nOregon last year?  <br/>\n-Follow up on any interests sparked during the trip <br/>\n-Look up answers to any questions not answered while on the road <br/>\n-Organize, notate and mount photographs in an album<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t_____________________<br/>\nThings to Follow Up on inspired by the trip:<br/>\n<br/>\n-&quot;Overlanders&quot; - who were they?  <br/>\n-Why so many references to Overlanders on the Yellowhead Hwy<br/>\nnorth of Kamloops?<br/>\n-Thompson and Fraser - the people and the rivers named after them<br/>\n-Further investigation of icefields and glaciers<br/>\n-How did Rogers ever find the pass?  -How did he chart his<br/>\ncourse?<br/>\n-Read Pierre Burton&#39;s &quot;Last Spike&quot; as a family read aloud<br/>\n-Research the mating habits of Elk<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skeane@...\">skeane@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mypage.direct.ca/s/skeane/\">http://mypage.direct.ca/s/skeane/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tanya in WA","from":"&quot;Tanya in WA&quot; &lt;tbone2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"D5ngv-g9Pr_mhTZ3zk4K4X4gXhxcMkGTXl2bl_Luwkmg25ZTkIXMdtxw2Au4Op6-Ao28MVnbWbvgupKVdHSsaivSoCGc6tBpnJY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Pulling a Learning Plan out of your Unschooling Life","postDate":"928859577","msgId":850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy42OC44NTAuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":849,"nextInTopic":878,"prevInTime":849,"nextInTime":851,"topicId":849,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
