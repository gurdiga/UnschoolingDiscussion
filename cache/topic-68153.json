OH <br/>\nYEAH, my SIL is now a substitute teacher. {so I have my mother, <br/>\nsister, husband&#39;s grandmother and now my SIL who do, or have, like in <br/>\nthe case of the grandmother, working in the PS system. hip hip hurray <br/>\nfor me - LOL }<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sil&#39;s oldest {13 I think} has just started the rebellious era of <br/>\nher life, I believe.

What?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You didn&#39;t?  You failure.  You wasted your potential.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Boy, did this strike a resonant chord within me.  I still struggle with the <br/>\nsense that I&#39;ve wasted my own potential.  I&#39;m hearing that from several <br/>\nothers here, too.  I&#39;m 42 years old, and what do I have to show for my life?  <br/>\nI don&#39;t go to HS reunions because I can&#39;t handle the scrutiny.  I know so <br/>\nmuch more was expected of me.  And so I find myself wanting so much more for <br/>\nmy children in this way -- at weak moments like this.  It&#39;s rather <br/>\ncompulsive, I realize.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I like about unschooling is that there are no definitions (and <br/>\ntherefore no limitations) placed on the concept of *potential.*  It&#39;s <br/>\ncompletely up to the individual child, and a wise parent learns to back off <br/>\nand let that flowering happen unimpeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat an enormous improvement over the pressures that a standard education <br/>\nnormally exerts!<br/>\n<br/>\nA question, then.  How do you guys actually practice getting yourselves out <br/>\nof the way and allowing your child to blossom into his/her own natural <br/>\npotential?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50009731,"authorName":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema","from":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;heidi@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] *Wasting your potential* was: perspective for Laura B.","postDate":"1052423896","msgId":68157,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMzA1MDgxMjU0NDAuMDFjNzc4ZTBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4LjMwNDg1NjM2LjJiZWMxMmUyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68153,"nextInTopic":68158,"prevInTime":68156,"nextInTime":68158,"topicId":68153,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As an example of their &#39;enabling&#39;, they recently found rides home <br/>\nfrom a local spring fair so that I wouldn&#39;t have to leave early and could <br/>\ncontinue shearing my sheep.  They saw I was in the middle of &#39;intensely <br/>\ninteresting&#39; stuff and let me continue on.  I do the same for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s when the parent gets so intensely interested in the child, <br/>\nespecially when they think of  their children as a &#39;product&#39; they&#39;re <br/>\nputting out (which harkens over to the whole stupid award thing - an Award <br/>\nfor a Great Product!), that things get botched up.  Once folks realize that <br/>\nthere is no &#39;product&#39;, they can usually let go of &#39;quality control&#39; and let <br/>\nthe kid be whomever they want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of unschooling as non-industrial art.<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake. Jeannette Rankin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67844,"nextTopicId":68407}}
