My mail server<br/>\ncr*pped out so I haven&#39;t been getting this list for a couple of days, but<br/>\nfrom searching on the yahoogroups website, it doesn&#39;t look to me like this<br/>\nthread was continued, so here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We also take a handful of multiple vitamins every night.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t tell from this sentence whether you are saying  you take a bunch of<br/>\nthe same multi-vitamins, or if you just mean that you take a bunch of<br/>\ndifferent vitamins but thought I&#39;d mention that taking a handful of one type<br/>\nof multi-vitamin could be dangerous. There are some vitamins you can OD on<br/>\n(especially in concentrated form), or at least are not healthy in large<br/>\namounts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think we could get enough of the vitamins in the foods we eat<br/>\n&gt;otherwise.  We are also overweight, so we can&#39;t eat too much, at least<br/>\n&gt;enough to get all the vitamins we need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, this is what I wanted to address, because nothing could be further<br/>\nfrom the truth. If you eat a well-balanced diet full of fresh fruits and<br/>\nvegetables, whole and sprouted grains, and natural protein sources, you<br/>\nshould easily be able to get enough vitamins *and* lose weight safely.<br/>\nAiming to lose a pound or *less* a week is a healthy way to lose weight -<br/>\nslowly and healthily. I have definitely been there, I was overweight most of<br/>\nmy life and lost almost 70 pounds through healthy eating and exercise. Then<br/>\nwhen I got pregnant with each of my kids, I gained 60+ pounds each time. So<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to do that weight-loss battle 2 more times as well. It took me<br/>\nabout a year each time to lose the weight, at 1/2 to 1 pound a week. It is<br/>\nhard not to buy into the &quot;diet&quot; fad, but much healthier to make a total<br/>\nlifestyle change and become healthy for life.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, that eating healthily of natural foods, you might not get every<br/>\nsingle vitamin in every single day. But over the course of a week, you<br/>\nshould get all that you need. If you are eating foods that are full of<br/>\nnutrition, instead of nutrition-poor junk foods, you should not have any<br/>\ntrouble losing weight while getting the proper nutrition. For instance, a<br/>\nbaked potato is only 200 calories, and has tons of vitamins and minerals<br/>\n(vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, b vitamins, magnesium, calcium, folate,<br/>\nzinc). By contrast, a McD&#39;s french fries has at least twice the calories,<br/>\nand about 1/4 the vitamins.<br/>\nThis website is a great place to look up the nutritional content of any<br/>\nfood:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hoptechno.com/nightcrew/sante7000/sante7000_search.cfm\">http://www.hoptechno.com/nightcrew/sante7000/sante7000_search.cfm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt shows calories, fat and sodium content, and 29 separate nutrients.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a good page that contains the short &quot;facts&quot; on each major vitamin,<br/>\nand lists foods that are sources:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62348-2000Nov27.html\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62348-2000Nov27.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We have looked into the raw-foods<br/>\n&gt;thing as well, but we don&#39;t have the discipline to eat just raw foods!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Eating just raw foods is great, but it&#39;s not necessary for having a healthy<br/>\nbody!<br/>\nAlso, exercise is a great mood booster, especially when combined with<br/>\nhealthy foods. Depression runs in my family and my sister is Bi-polar, as is<br/>\nmy dad I suspect (though he has not been diagnosed). My sister has been able<br/>\nto control her depression through exercise and diet alone. I know for myself<br/>\nthat if I don&#39;t exercise every day, my mood takes a definite turn for the<br/>\nworse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m saying all of this because I have spent years of my life being<br/>\noverweight and unhealthy. I know how wrong it feels, how depressing it is,<br/>\nand how hard it can be to change. But I also know what it feels like to come<br/>\nout the other side, so I hope I have offered something here to encourage you<br/>\nto make this a total lifestyle change for your family! I think modeling<br/>\ntaking good care of our bodies is one of the best gifts we can give our<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) inventor of new and wonderful things<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) singer of protest songs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21294,"nextTopicId":21365}}
