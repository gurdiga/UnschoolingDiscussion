I also know <br/>\nthat kids need company (even when I don&#39;t feel like giving it, but <br/>\nthat&#39;s a different story...)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother of one of my sis&#39;s friends was a Health Visitor (kind-<br/>\nof community nurse/social worker for young families, mostly...)  <br/>\nShe had some very different neighbourhoods on her &#39;patch.&#39;  One <br/>\nwas very posh, lots of money and space etc.  The parents of a <br/>\nbaby in this neighbourhood were worried.  The child was eating <br/>\nenough (well, drinking, still on milk only) but not gaining weight, <br/>\nnot progressing, real &#39;failure-to-thrive.&#39;  This child would want for <br/>\nnothing material, had the most beautifully decorated nursery, slept <br/>\nin her cot, etc etc, the parents couldn&#39;t understand what was <br/>\nwrong with her.  Also on this HV&#39;s round was a gypsy camp.  <br/>\nThere was a baby there about the same age, so the HV took the <br/>\nrich parents to the gypsy camp to see ths other baby.  They found <br/>\nthis baby, sat on a pile of thrown-out furniture, mattresses and <br/>\nstuff.  The kid was filthy, squalid, even.  But this child was so <br/>\nhealthy!  Why?  He had people around him, interacting with him, <br/>\nand he wasn&#39;t living in a sterile nursery.  The other baby only had <br/>\ncontact with others when she needed feeding or changing, as soon <br/>\nas the obvious things were done, she was left &#39;quiet&#39; in the <br/>\nnursery.  Well, the rich people didn&#39;t start living like gypsies but <br/>\nthey did see that children need to play, and that muck won&#39;t break <br/>\nthem :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue story, folks...<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;unschooling@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"2Y_kVNzvT-FSdwebmYhsnnAL4C40UU--F93Z391k34oTrKy1hZuyBMH49ky7xt2pFx9qNSPNl71GsNptWhXykwRboMOnbw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: mud","postDate":"987454739","msgId":18793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5EQkJLTkJCQ0tJSkJCR1BPRkpMQUVJTERKQUEudW5zY2hvb2xpbmdAY3RlbC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwNDE2LjA5NDM1MC4tNDMwMTQ3LjEubWVnYXRlc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":18747,"nextInTopic":18809,"prevInTime":18792,"nextInTime":18794,"topicId":18747,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe that is why my kids are generally so healthy.
