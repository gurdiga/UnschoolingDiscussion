Has *anybody* EVER used this? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have, but then I never learned to diagram the REALLY crazed 35 word 19th <br/>\ncentury sentences.  I know people used to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe modern-day solution seems to be to have grammatical experts (editors) or <br/>\nto just make shorter, simpler sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a context in which long, complicated sentences are preferred, sometimes <br/>\nit&#39;s possible to lose sight of what the subject was, and what tense and voice <br/>\nit&#39;s all in, and a diagram is a way to splay it all out and find missing or <br/>\nmis-matched parts.  It&#39;s &quot;showing all your work,&quot; grammatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a large part of why it has fallen by the wayside is that it&#39;s only <br/>\nuseful to a very small percentage of people.   But in the interest of <br/>\ndiscipline and conformity, the English school system was teaching Latin and <br/>\nEnglish.   With diagramming, they could show them in parallel.  It created a <br/>\nkind of common denominator, or common base-system to analyze English grammar <br/>\nin the same way they were Latin.<br/>\n<br/>\nLatin is what&#39;s known as a dead language.  It&#39;s fixed as it is, because it&#39;s <br/>\nnot spoken by any native speakers.  It&#39;s good to know for <br/>\nhistorical/linguistic purposes (for people so inclined) and for those who <br/>\nwant to translate or read medieval legal texts, or pre-medieval historians, <br/>\nor for those who need to work at the Vatican.  It was required of medical <br/>\nstudents and pharmacists into the second part of the 20th century, mostly out <br/>\nof tradition, and so that they could more readily understand the names of <br/>\nmedicines and body parts and procedures (although LOTS of those are in Greek <br/>\nand not Latin, which points to the history of medical research and scientific <br/>\ninquiry.  The reason given, though, which seems to me to be the least of the <br/>\npurposes was because prescriptions were written in Latin.  It was partly the <br/>\nmedieval trades guild tradition, to keep their stuff arcane and to require <br/>\nlots of hoop-jumping to get in.  It also enabled doctors to share their <br/>\nresearch in Latin, but I think it&#39;s been a long time since researchers wrote <br/>\nup their findings in Latin to share.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a snob-appeal, a class-protection, in England (and somewhat in the <br/>\nU.S.) about &quot;having Latin.&quot;   Except for its uses in understanding <br/>\nsimilarities in some European languages, though, it&#39;s a bit like the stars on <br/>\nthe first star-bellied sneetches, only it takes a lot of work and nobody is <br/>\nborn with it.  No native-speaker advantage for anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nDissecting English was traditionally required, because they were doing the <br/>\nwhole &quot;nominative case&quot; kind of lingo for so long (trying to make English fit <br/>\nLatin&#39;s grammatical rules, and having specialized grammatical terms to baffle <br/>\nthe uninitiated--not the original purpose, but the ultimate result.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we totally reject the lingo and the analysis, then only a specialized few <br/>\nwill be able to polish language to a long-term, respectable, publishable <br/>\nlevel.  But it&#39;s probably always been that way anyway, school just pretended <br/>\nit was something everyone NEEDED to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish, being a living language, changes and grows, and so attempts to <br/>\nfossilize an early 19th century form failed.  It&#39;s called &quot;prescriptive <br/>\ngrammar,&quot; trying to solidify English and make it &quot;sit; stay.&quot;   The business <br/>\nof charting the language as it exists and as it changes and describing what <br/>\nnative speakers DO say and write is &quot;descriptive grammar.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople with no special interest in the intricacies of language don&#39;t need to <br/>\ndiagram sentences any more than I need to dissect a horse and learn where all <br/>\nthe nerves and muscles are.  That&#39;s for veterinarians who plan to need to <br/>\nknow how to put a horse back together someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35890,"nextTopicId":35773}}
