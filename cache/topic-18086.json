My son (also nursing) had a severe food allergy reaction and I had to<br/>\neliminate tons of stuff from my diet. For several months there I was eating<br/>\nno meat, dairy, fish, shellfish, nuts, soy products, or gluten .... which as<br/>\nyou can guess basically left me with almost nothing to eat! Both of my<br/>\nnurslings were fine through this period, even my daughter who was almost<br/>\nexclusively breastfed (she was just starting to get some solids). She<br/>\nweighed 25 lbs at one year old, so I know she wasn&#39;t starving, LOL.
