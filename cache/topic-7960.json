I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>\nhusband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>\nclosed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>\nfrom the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>\nhave bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>\nwatch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>\nscent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>\ntheir mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>\nmelts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nmemories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>\nare learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>\nmissed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>\ndrawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>\nand baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>\nand self-centred jock!<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>\nthe simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>\nsome of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>\npleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>\nbond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>\nrocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>\nthat nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>\ncould ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>\nbaby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>\nthe same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>\nthe breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>\nnever learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>\nHe simply FED me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>\nit has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>\nunderstand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>\nnot possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>\nthe other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>\n<br/>\nDamian.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon and Stephanie wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable about<br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding. We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he knows<br/>\n&gt; all the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more confused<br/>\n&gt; by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>\n&gt; feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH would<br/>\n&gt; rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and that we<br/>\n&gt; have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>\n&gt; thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I just<br/>\n&gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he may<br/>\n&gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire process<br/>\n&gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant without a<br/>\n&gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>\n&gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>\n&gt; feeding?

If I was out anywhere with him I would rush <br/>\nhome to feed him, I was uncomfortable nursing in front of anyone <br/>\nexcept for my husband, and this was a real pity.  With each baby I <br/>\nnoticed society&#39;s perception of breast feeding changing, it got to <br/>\nthe point when I had my last baby in &#39;96, that people are more <br/>\nlikely to frown on a woman giving a baby a bottle than seeing a <br/>\nwoman nursing.  To my way of thinking, no-one should frown at <br/>\neither, because as we know for different reasons not all women can <br/>\nbreast feed their infants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>\n&gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>\n&gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.
