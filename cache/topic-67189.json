If UU <br/>\nwas not available to me, I would definitely be in the Unity church ~ our <br/>\ngroups are so small, we often do things together, like peach marches, jam <br/>\nsessions with our collective musicians, etc... <br/>\n diana,<br/>\nThe wackiest widow westriver...<br/>\nâ€œI&#39;m just a human being trying to make it in a world that is very rapidly <br/>\nlosing it&#39;s understanding of being human&quot; John Trudell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling and life","postDate":"1051815373","msgId":67189,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0LjNkNDM2Nzc2LjJiZTJjN2NkQGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":67217,"prevInTime":67188,"nextInTime":67190,"topicId":67189,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/1/03 10:35:04 AM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-493590811\">In a message dated 5/1/03 10:35:04 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Whatever my kids choose I will siuport them 100%.
