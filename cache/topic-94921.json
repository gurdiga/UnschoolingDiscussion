He<br/>\nsort of gets about $5 /week automatically because he takes care of the dog<br/>\nregularly and does &quot;morning things&quot; which basically means take care of<br/>\nyourself without being reminded so I don&#39;t have to wory about it when it&#39;s<br/>\ntime to go somewhere.  After that, if he wants more money he can do chores<br/>\nor garden or any number of other things that help the family.  He typically<br/>\nfinds something he wants to buy and then does extra work until he has enough<br/>\nmoney for it.<br/>\n  8yo dd wants a steady amount each week. She gets $7 and doesn&#39;t have to<br/>\nearn it by doing specific things.  She helps out about the same as he does,<br/>\nbut it isn&#39;t linked to a dollar amount.  3yo dd just wants to be able to<br/>\nspend money on a toy when we go to the store and sometimes she says &quot;can I<br/>\nget some money if I help you clean?&quot;  I give it to her but I still buy her<br/>\nwhat she wants usually.  It adds up to about $5 to $10/week but I don&#39;t keep<br/>\ntrack so much with her.    All the kids keep their money in the bank of Mom<br/>\nand withdraw when they want.  Usually if we are going to an amusement park<br/>\nor farmers market or something like that they will ask for the cash before<br/>\nhand so they have more autonomy when they want to buy something.  The only<br/>\nelement missing at this point is the long-term savings.  We have some (not a<br/>\nlot) of money in IRAs for them but they don&#39;t put any away themselves.<br/>\n-Krisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94894,"nextTopicId":94909}}
