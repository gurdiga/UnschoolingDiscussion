The other just after<br/>\nshe turned 5. (both wanted to learn to read then) My first dd within few<br/>\nshort weeks could read about anything. She is 8 now.  My second who is only<br/>\n6 now, spent several weeks learning how to read and can probably read on a<br/>\nsecond grade level.  With both of them, after they got it, they had no<br/>\ninterest in reading any more.  They wanted to know *how* to read, learned,<br/>\nand then went on with other things in life.  They do read board game spaces,<br/>\ncereal boxes, real-life stuff they want to know, and some non-fiction<br/>\ncaption type stuff, but don&#39;t read books for entertainment.  I always<br/>\npictured them curled up in a chair reading a good book and loving it.  I<br/>\nnever imagined them strewing the books around the living room and using them<br/>\nfor beds for their stuffed animals.  BUT, they love books, they love to be<br/>\nread to, and they know how to read.  I have learned to wait patiently for<br/>\nthe day to come when they want to read and curl up in a chair with a good<br/>\nbook.  It&#39;s been over 3 years now since my first dd learned to read.....I am<br/>\nstill waiting........trying to be patient......I know someday she will enjoy<br/>\nit........she is only 8.............she hates to do anything unless she can<br/>\ndo it perfectly..........waiting........patiently................<br/>\n <br/>\nMy dh and I always have a book in our face (or a pc screen) it&#39;s inevitable<br/>\nthat she will too, eventually.  :0)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Maine-unschooling@...\">Maine-unschooling@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/\">http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.&quot;<br/>\nEmerson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] early readers","postDate":"1046124623","msgId":59521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBODA1NUVBLjFGNDclYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDYxMTA4MTkuMjAyMC43OTQ0NC5tNkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59526,"prevInTime":59520,"nextInTime":59522,"topicId":59521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I saw the same<br/>\nkind of progression that unschoolers talk about, just earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who aren&#39;t taught to read seem to start to read when they want to, and<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re ready just take off.  No waiting for the teacher to teach them<br/>\nthose hard words.  Tim&#39;s technique was to just skip anything he couldn&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out fast enough for his tastes.  Eventually he recognized writen<br/>\nsounds fast enough that he could identify the word because he knew them<br/>\naurally, and didn&#39;t skip so many words.  He&#39;s 6 now, by the way, and hasn&#39;t<br/>\nmet anything he can&#39;t read, although he only survived 3 pages of one of his<br/>\nfather&#39;s beloved theology tomes before declaring it &quot;offensively boring&quot;.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point to me wasn&#39;t when he read, but that he wasn&#39;t forced to learn to<br/>\nread.  He learned happily, himself.  (We were in the process of moving<br/>\noverseas.  Mom was frazzled.  Definitely no teaching going on here!)  Now I<br/>\nsee where Tim reads much the way I do.  Most days, he reads signs, the<br/>\nfunnies, some other parts of the newspaper, maybe a magazine article, and<br/>\nthat&#39;s about it.  Occasionally he reads a book.  Swallows it whole, more<br/>\nlike.  Never let the sun go down on your book is our motto!  But he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;Drop Everything And Read&quot; for 20 minutes, twice a day, as the school thinks<br/>\nhe should.  My mother told him about that, and how he should do that.  I<br/>\nthink that was a turning point for Tim and advice from my Mom.  He looked at<br/>\nher like she was just bananas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, yes, 8 or 10 may be average, but 16 is fine as is 3 like my friend&#39;s<br/>\nson who learned to read when his older sister did; he just never bothered to<br/>\nmention that he was listening to her reading lessons (a story in and of<br/>\nitself, but I&#39;m goin&#39; to bed!).<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59509,"nextTopicId":59510}}
