\n  this KakWorm virus with others.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how, where, when, or why it \n  came into my system, and even with my Norton&nbsp;AntiVirus program, it was \n  detected in only a small part of my computer (namely, the signature part of my \n  Outlook Express).&nbsp; To completely eradicate the virus from your \n  computers,&nbsp;read the last portion of Eric Chien&#39;s article which is at the \n  end of this posting, and follow the steps he suggests.&nbsp; </font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Thanks for your prompt attention -- and for your \n  forgiveness!!</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">~Linda</font></div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div>&nbsp;</div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\"\n size=\"2\">***********************************************</font></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br>...&nbsp;I&#39;ve been geeking for a living for \n  many years, and in that<br>time I&#39;ve been responsible for keeping a great many \n  computers<br>virus-free and stable in all kinds of environments, or cleaning \n  them<br>after someone else let them get infected.

Most \n  other<br>manufacturers probably did the same. I have my software set to \n  check<br>all files for viruses as they&#39;re created on my hard drive, so I \n  was<br>alerted as soon as the mail was downloaded - before I read it. \n  Some<br>people don&#39;t use that level of security - it isn&#39;t the default in \n  any<br>program I&#39;ve used recently - so if you&#39;re using your \n  program&#39;s<br>default settings, you might not have been alerted until you \n  started<br>to open the message.
