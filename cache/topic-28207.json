Does anyone know<br/>\nthe name of the book? Would you recommend it?<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt also wrote something once (maybe in Instead of Education) about<br/>\nwhy some alternative schools (back when alternative school meant a place<br/>\nwhere kids were allowed more freedom than in most schools) seemed to harbor<br/>\nfairly large numbers of angry, depressed, frustrated young people (not just<br/>\nkids who were recovering form having been badly treated in traditional<br/>\nschools, but kids who had spent their entire childhoods relatively free).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis conclusion was that, in a school where the kids are freed of the petty,<br/>\nsilly demands of tests and grades and homework and dress codes and proper<br/>\nuse of titles in addressing the adults and correct format for chapter<br/>\noutlines and so on, at a certain age they cant help waking up to the fact<br/>\nthat they are basically here in a society and a world that often makes very<br/>\nlittle sense and that most adults are doing little to try to change. In the<br/>\nwords of Paul Goodman (in a book by this title), they are growing up<br/>\nabsurd.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn wrote that this doesnt mean the alternative schools failed  because<br/>\nit wasnt really their job to turn out happy people. You allow kids to spend<br/>\nearly childhood stomping in mud puddles, throwing things up in the air,<br/>\nreading the storybooks they like best and building whatever they want out of<br/>\nLegos - and at some point that isnt enough anymore. They want to tackle<br/>\nreal problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm thinking a lot about this lately because my husband and I are trying to<br/>\nfigure out a way for him to do something better with his life than be the<br/>\nmanager of a Manhattan consumer electronics store for a major corporation.<br/>\nWe had been thinking about this for a while, but the events of Sept. 11th<br/>\nclinched it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my husband and I believe, as we do, that (for example) our wasteful use<br/>\nof oil has something to do with the tensions and bloodshed connected to the<br/>\nMiddle East and, increasingly, other parts of the world, why are we not<br/>\ndoing something about it? The saddest thing about this society to me is that<br/>\nso few adults do work they really believe in, and that contributes to<br/>\npositive change, rather than just something to make a living.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can teenagers not be upset to look around and see that this is true?<br/>\nThey are bombarded by urgent messages from the media about all that is<br/>\nterrible in the world, and then they look around and see that their own<br/>\nparents are doing nothing to change anything. If the kids are asked to help<br/>\nat all, its in the form of penny drives (not to knock the charity, but it<br/>\ndoesnt tend to get at the roots of big problems). If you were a teen,<br/>\nwouldnt all this make you feel like snapping and carping at your parents,<br/>\nrebelling and picking fights over nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself left home at 15 and, aside from the fact that we had a lot of<br/>\nfamily problems, part of it was feeling that I was growing up absurd.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Okay, so now the person who posted the original question about teenage<br/>\nrebellion will probably respond that his/her parents were full-time<br/>\nenvironmentalists/peace activists/alternative technology promoters, in an<br/>\norganization that truly accomplished practical things, who always allowed<br/>\nhim/her to be involved in important volunteer work - and that will blow my<br/>\ntheory about his/her own disaffected youth!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if anyone has any leads on positive jobs for my husband, possibly in<br/>\nalternative (solar, wind, fuel cell, etc.) energy, ethical investing or<br/>\nmicrocredit, please email me privately. His experience is in retail and<br/>\ncomputers but he has a degree in psychology, for what thats worth. We want<br/>\nout of New York City, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself am busy with our two-year-old and with writing a book on attachment<br/>\nparenting/the continuum concept, but could do something part-time to<br/>\nsupplement his pay (translating, interpreting, childcare, environmental ed,<br/>\nteaching English as a second language, writing, editing).<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: meghan anderson [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moonmeghan@...\">moonmeghan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 2:43 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: control<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like my homelife and teenage years as<br/>\nwell.
