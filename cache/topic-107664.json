I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt;why <br/>\n&gt; this so bothers me; that he does no figurative drawing at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; / liza sabater<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; mother of thing1 and thing2<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL my DS is 7 and he&#39;d rather draw schematic looking things than <br/>\ndogs and sunshine and flowers. When he was a tot (maybe 3?) he drew <br/>\ntwo rows of squares with lines connecting them one corner to another <br/>\ncorner. He said it was the electricity wires connecting the houses! <br/>\nIt&#39;s only recently that he has even gone to multi-colored within a <br/>\ndrawing (generally he just keeps going with whatever comes to hand). <br/>\nAnd that was mostly because he wanted to draw &quot;battles&quot; <br/>\nbetween &quot;monsters&quot; - I get one color and he gets another and we <br/>\ncreate &#39;robots&#39; and then &#39;zap&#39; each other with rays and <br/>\nbuild &#39;shields&#39; and all. Oh, and now his favorite thing is playing <br/>\nwith PaintShop Pro (last night he made a yellow spiderweb and a <br/>\nblack dot for a spider. then he added blue dots, those were the <br/>\nspider&#39;s prey, per his explanation, and he draw black lines from the <br/>\noriginal spider location to the prey locations) and with the CAD/CAM <br/>\nsoftware that I use for work (I have it on my home computer as well <br/>\nso I can work from home sometimes). He loves making spheres and <br/>\ncones and such because he can shade them so they look really solid - <br/>\nlast night he made the solar system - yellow sphere for sun, various <br/>\nsizes and colors of spheres for planets, including the unnamed <br/>\npossible planet 10 (I found a bit about it in this week&#39;s Time <br/>\nmagazine and pointed it out to him and we spent a good 30 minutes <br/>\nthinking up names for it - I&#39;m leaning toward &#39;George&#39; or &#39;Wow&#39; <br/>\nmyself lol - I&#39;m thinking some enterprising person should auction <br/>\noff naming rights via eBay - the funds to go to subsidizing further <br/>\nstudy of the new planet).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as some people don&#39;t read fiction and others love it and some <br/>\nread only for information and others read anything they can get <br/>\ntheir hands on, I think it follows that some people will draw <br/>\ncolorfully and fancifully and others won&#39;t. For that matter, perhaps <br/>\nyour DS just won&#39;t tolerate anything that looks less than exactly <br/>\nlike his subject so he just doesn&#39;t go there.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":188668263,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;pennsu@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Fwd: Drawing Anxiety","postDate":"1123087021","msgId":107667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE2OTkyNTNmMjM1MjAwZWVjZGUwMDdhNzgyZDJhMTU1QG1zdS5lZHU+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFiZWU4NGYyODQ4YzBlYzI4ZTNlNjgyYjc5Y2ZmYjJjQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFiZWU4NGYyODQ4YzBlYzI4ZTNlNjgyYjc5Y2ZmYjJjQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":107666,"nextInTopic":107668,"prevInTime":107666,"nextInTime":107668,"topicId":107664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Don t know if this will help: I recently read the book Why Gender Matters by Leonard Sax.

Very interesting--the author argues that there <br/>\nare real sex differences, but they&#39;re not what we tend to think they <br/>\nare (that is, not &quot;girls are no good at math&quot; but other things about <br/>\nhow learning is accomplished and relationships are formed and managed). <br/>\nHe says that boys do not tend to draw figures as much as girls do, that <br/>\noften at ages where girls are drawing little scenes of houses and <br/>\nfamilies with flowers and trees and the sky and family dogs (and <br/>\ngetting praised a lot by teachers for it), boys are often drawing <br/>\nthings that look like scribbles. But if you ask the boys to tell you <br/>\nabout their pictures, they will say that they have drawn a depiction of <br/>\nsome kind of action. For instance, they might say they drew a dune <br/>\nbuggy going all around, and the scribble, to them, represents the path <br/>\nof the dune buggy. After I read that, I realized that my son does this <br/>\nall the time! He also draws figures, but a lot of his pictures are just <br/>\ncomplex scribbles, and he will say that he drew a vehicle driving <br/>\naround, or a fire burning, or a volcano erupting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helped me to become aware of this because I did sometimes have <br/>\nthoughts like, &quot;he can draw pictures of things, why is he doing all <br/>\nthis stuff that is &#39;just&#39; scribbling?&quot; I actually worried at one point <br/>\nthat he was regressing developmentally because he had done all these <br/>\nreally accurate pictures of things like helicopters, but then for weeks <br/>\nall he was doing was scribbling happily away. But being cued by Sax&#39;s <br/>\nbook to listen for him to tell me what was going on in his pictures <br/>\nmade me aware that he has a specific purpose in drawing those <br/>\n&quot;scribbles&quot; and they are very satisfying for him.  Now I realize that <br/>\nhe is getting what HE needs out of the drawing he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 3, 2005, at 12:03 PM, liza sabater wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hey all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  At one point or another writing and reading anxieties come up on this<br/>\n&gt;  list but, what about drawing.
