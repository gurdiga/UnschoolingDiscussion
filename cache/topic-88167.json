Do *I* understand THAT! &lt;g&gt; I&#39;ve been taking my own break.), so I <br/>\nforwarded this message on to her for her imput. She didn&#39;t want to come here, <br/>\nbut she asked that I forward her response on.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***We&#39;ve been &quot;officially&quot; homeschooling since<br/>\nSeptember, but haven&#39;t really changed anything, except keep Felix&#39;s<br/>\ndrawings and all in case we get asked about them by the school board.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just talking about this to a woman who comes to my library program.  <br/>\nShe is a single homeschooling Mom and I usually try not to mix my unschooling <br/>\npassion with my library program, but everyone else had left and she was there <br/>\ntalking to me and I just could NOT listen to her tell me anymore about how she <br/>\nis only giving her daughter three worksheets a week instead of six, and how she <br/>\nwon&#39;t do math with her because she, the Mom, is so bad at math.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would CRINGE whenever something like that came out of her mouth, so I <br/>\nfinally said, &quot;Do you know about unschooling?&quot;  And I gave her the basic overview <br/>\nof unschooling...and she was very interested.  But she kept saying she wants <br/>\nsomething there in case the school system asks for documentation.  I told her I <br/>\nthought that wasn&#39;t very fair to her child because some states don&#39;t require <br/>\nANY homeschool reporting or documentation.  I said I would not punish my <br/>\nchildren with doing school just because we live in New York State and have to do <br/>\nquarterly reports.  She went off into a dreamy state and said she wishes she <br/>\ncould be like mutual friends of ours who homeschool underground and don&#39;t have to <br/>\nanswer to the system.  I told her she COULD.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLive AS IF school does not exist.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf people put as much life&#39;s energy into living a rich, joyful life with <br/>\ntheir child as they put into worrying about what the schools believe our children <br/>\nshould be learning, then the children would be getting LOADS more than the <br/>\nchildren in school were getting...and in many more ways than just academia.  But <br/>\nsome parents are so consumed with comparing their children, worrying about <br/>\nreporting to the school, worrying about what their children AREN&#39;T getting, that <br/>\nthey close off that path that could be letting in so much LIFE, so much JOY, <br/>\nand so much TRUST. <br/>\n<br/>\nFear must be released in order for Joy, Life, and Real Learning to enter.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenevieve, what does Jonathan love to do?  Where does he SHINE?  When, in <br/>\nlife, is he able to see himself shining in his Mom&#39;s eyes?  Because I&#39;m reading <br/>\nabout how he is frustrating you...and I&#39;m sure there are times when he does <br/>\nSHINE...but it&#39;s absent from this post.  And if it&#39;s absent from this post, it <br/>\nmight be absent from your lives, too...and you might need a reminder to shift <br/>\nyour perspective of your son and see him for his blessings, his gifts.  He needs <br/>\nto be celebrated for Who He Is, and not seen as a frustration.  He KNOWS he&#39;s <br/>\nfrustrating you, and that&#39;s SO frustrating to him, which sets up this vicious <br/>\ncycle even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cycle of frustration will end when you decide to let it end.  Focus on <br/>\nthis child&#39;s true spirit.  Trust that he is in this world to bless you and teach <br/>\nyou and share his gifts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis child does not need school, as he is a non-typical child who will be <br/>\ndestroyed in school by being told over and over again that he needs to change and <br/>\nconform.  He needs to know that he is fine just As He Is.  Once he feels <br/>\nloved and honored for those things that make him Who He Is, the rest of the <br/>\n&quot;behavior&quot; challenges will be minimized.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf his behavior is bad at the dinner table, listen to that.  He&#39;s not telling <br/>\nyou in words how he feels, but he&#39;s still telling you.  Why does he have to <br/>\nbe at the dinner table?  Let him be Free.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf his behavior is bad at crowded places, PLEASE listen to that.  I have a <br/>\nchild who gets very anxious in crowded places, and we honor that about him.  We <br/>\nbelieved him when he said things like that make him nervous.  We were in the <br/>\nmall the other day, and the lights and the music in some stores made him so <br/>\nanxious.  He is 13 now and because his family has always honored him and believed <br/>\nhim (frustations, quirks and all...), he knows now that when he starts <br/>\nfeeling anxious from crowds or certain people or other things that it&#39;s OK.  He&#39;s <br/>\nstill OK.  He can walk outside and breathe.  He can shift his focus to things <br/>\nthat he loves.  Because he knows it&#39;s OK to be HimSelf...he knows that no one <br/>\nwill ask him to be any less that who he truly is, even if that includes becoming <br/>\nanxious and not understanding some things (like simple directions sometimes).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does Jonathan love?  What are his passions?  What does he eat up when he <br/>\nsees it (I mean his brain and his heart, not his mouth!)?  What part of the <br/>\nworld does he introduce to you?  Do you honor that and listen to that and find <br/>\nthat interesting?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAllow your child to SHINE in your eyes.  Focus on those shining moments, and <br/>\nthe frustrating moments will not completely disappear, but will be easier for <br/>\nyou will have a greater understanding of your child&#39;s spirit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPut away the school work, lighten up the control, and focus on your child&#39;s <br/>\nheart, his passions.  See his frustrating behavior as his way of trying to tell <br/>\nyou something else.  Believe him.  Honor him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSee the world from his eyes, from his heart, and let him take you into that <br/>\npart of the world that he loves and understands...that part of the world where <br/>\nhe sees himself Shining.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend you read &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child&quot; and see if you see <br/>\nyour son in it.  Also, raising your spirited child might be beneficiary (I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever read it, but it is recommended by others).   <br/>\n<br/>\nBe Well ~<br/>\nAnne O.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88234,"nextTopicId":88224}}
