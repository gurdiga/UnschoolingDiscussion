SO I will <br/>\nmake this shorter.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Deb, I think kids who don&#39;t act normal per say are certainly mis <br/>\nand over diagnosed.  That is why we waited so long to do anything <br/>\nabout Ben.  Contrary to what people may think, I have unschooled all <br/>\nof my kids. Andrew til he was in 6th grade (when my dh decided Andy <br/>\nneeded more stuff to do). Ben and Autumn have always been unschooled <br/>\nwhile home.  The reason I say &#39;while home&#39; is that Ben did have a5 <br/>\nweek stint in a devdelay preschool,  6months after his diagnosis of <br/>\npdd-nos.  A couple of days a week.  He like it while there, but the <br/>\nanxiety around it and coming home was just unbearable for him. So we <br/>\ntook him out and went back to unschooling.  Now 2.5 years later, and <br/>\nsome recent testing for medicaid services purposes, his specialists <br/>\nwant him to try school again.  I was thinking maybe they were right, <br/>\nbut after reading archived msg here, Sandra&#39;s site, and chatting on <br/>\nthe AutismUnschool board, my dh and decided to stick with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen&#39;s autistic and anxiety issues (which are interrelated and <br/>\ninfluences by severe sensory issues) arose as a toddler and while <br/>\nstill unschooled attachment parented.  His anxiety is crippling to <br/>\nhim, and had no external motivating factor.  He was born like that. <br/>\nHowever, I could have a baby born with another problem, and would not <br/>\nhesistate to help them in anyway. Ben&#39;s anxiety was like a wall that <br/>\nencircled him all the time, keeping him from being happy and enjoying <br/>\nlife.  Now most of that wall has evaporated...letting the wonderful <br/>\nhappy Ben to come out and play.  I only feel bad that we didn&#39;t do <br/>\nthis sooner for him Paxil.  But I was so stubborn and convinced that <br/>\ndrugs were not or ever the answer, that he suffered needlessly for a <br/>\ngood 2+ years before we consented to try the paxil, exposing him <br/>\ninstead to ridiculously strict diets and various therapies to learn <br/>\nto not be so afraid naturally. What a waste of time...especially for <br/>\nmy precious little Ben.

They are the most<br/>\nopenly oppressed members of our society.  I think unschoolers need to<br/>\nlook at our society&#39;s accepted range of kid behaviors and really question<br/>\nit.  Finding children to be outside the range of normal and labeling and<br/>\ntreating them is a very profitable business.  It&#39;s worth questioning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli pointed out that you were not an unschooling family when Ben was so<br/>\ntroubled by anxiety issues nor at the time he went on medication.   That<br/>\nmakes a big difference and if you move in an unschooling direction it<br/>\nmight make a difference in how you see Bens problem, how Ben see&#39;s<br/>\nhimself and his world, and how open you all are to different ways you<br/>\nmight be of help to him.

So anxious, scared <br/>\nand freaked out, that he couldn&#39;t cope with much,***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he wasn&#39;t being unschooled.<br/>\n <br/>\nThings can be so different when a person is accepted for what he is and allowed to develop at his own pace.   Also, being able to develop the things that really matter to them will give them so much confidence.  I&#39;m not saying that you don&#39;t accept him for what he is,  but when there are those school types of  levels for him to measure up to,  he&#39;s really going stress out from that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son would have Asperger&#39;s type qualities if he were to be evaluated,  and I have seen such amazing things happen with him since we&#39;ve started unschooling.  When he was in school and home &#39;schooled&#39;,  he was a depressed, sad boy.  He didn&#39;t want to get up, he was very nervous all the time,  started to develop a tick,  all sorts of things like this.  (Things like you described above.)  I know there had to be a better way and when I read about unschooling I knew that was it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***So, with much fear <br/>\nand trembling ourselves we tried medication and what happened was <br/>\nlike watching a flower on the verge of death come back to life and <br/>\nbloom so beautifully!***<br/>\n<br/>\n This is what happened with Alec when we started unschooling.   It has allowed him to be the person he is meant to be.  He has now blossomed into a more secure, happy, content person.   He also loves his computer games and video games,  it is his passion.   Gaming has also lead to so many other avenues of interest; such as:  history, mathematics, grammar, science, speech/communication, writing, reading, geography.  It would cover any subject a curriculum would suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom your first post it sounds like Ben has alot of the same interests as Alec.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the more you can allow him to be himself and let him do what brings joy to him,  the better.   Can you talk with your husband more about unschooling?  My husband was also hesitant about it all, at first.  But the more and more that I researched it and shared with him my research,  he started to see the sense in it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing on the meds front.  I don&#39;t have experience with any of my children being put on meds.  But I do have experience with myself and meds.  I know that when I was trying to be something I wasn&#39;t and wasn&#39;t listening to my heart I really struggled.  Trying to do what everybody else wanted landed me on meds.   Now I know there are other factors also,  and there is a time and place for meds.  But when I truly stopped and listened to my heart and took care of myself,  I was able to go off the meds.  I was then also able to be my true self. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know from reading your post,  you didn&#39;t go the meds route lightly and I&#39;m not judging you for that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I felt in my heart that I wanted to bring up another perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Please somebody H-E-L-P!!!","postDate":"1074145477","msgId":88961,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU3QTE1OTg2LTQ3MUQtMTFEOC05Qzc4LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwNDAxMTQwOTA4MDYuMDI1ZDM2MDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGJ1MWg4MSs1ZXViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Ni4wLjAuMjIuMC4yMDA0MDExNDA5MDgwNi4wMjVkMzYwMEBzaGF3bWFpbC5ndi5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":88910,"nextInTopic":88964,"prevInTime":88960,"nextInTime":88962,"topicId":88813,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I wouldn&#39;t &#39;make&#39; him go so <br/>\n&gt; I did it in an unhanded way (the expert didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; see any &#39;issue&#39; with this by the way).  :o(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; School did seem to help us at first but I now think of how <br/>\n&gt; appearances are so deceptive.  For us, the reason ds <br/>\n&gt; went to school wasn&#39;t actually &#39;fixed&#39;.  Ds had to learn<br/>\n&gt; different coping mechanisms at school without his mom<br/>\n&gt; for his aggressiveness (he didn&#39;t hurt other kids just acted<br/>\n&gt; very mad even at the littlest thing).  I didn&#39;t know or even <br/>\n&gt; think to ask if they would discipline him in some way, I&#39;d assumed <br/>\n&gt; that the school would never discipline my child without<br/>\n&gt; asking me.  Well, I guess time out in a certain area (the<br/>\n&gt; open closet) is not something you need to tell the parents.  <br/>\n&gt; It was during a family meeting at the school I learned how<br/>\n&gt; ds hardly has to do to the time area anymore.  How humiliated<br/>\n&gt; and embarrassed my little boy must have been.  :o(   I&#39;ve since<br/>\n&gt; learned how much both my dc are highly sensitive.  Ds more so<br/>\n&gt; than dd and I can only wonder now if that&#39;s because of his time<br/>\n&gt; in school.  Anyway, I now feel like like I have more things to <br/>\n&gt; work through with ds than I did before he went to school.  <br/>\n&gt; Many more negatives came out of school than positives imo.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **I&#39;d read many, many parenting books by this time<br/>\n&gt; and that&#39;s why I felt confused and didn&#39;t trust myself or listen<br/>\n&gt; closely to what ds wanted imo (Lyle mentioned something about<br/>\n&gt; this very recently).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe the traditional school classes for some &#39;special&#39; ed kids is <br/>\n&gt; a good thing but after my experience I&#39;m hard pressed to think so.<br/>\n&gt; If I still felt the need for help with ds or doubted myself again<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d try to find something that we could do without sending my child<br/>\n&gt; off to school everyday.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, try to read some of Sandra Dodd&#39;s pages about unschooling with<br/>\n&gt; games and television.  There is a way that you and ds can have<br/>\n&gt; your cake and eat it too.  &lt;g&gt;  Letting ds do what he wants to do incl.<br/>\n&gt; all the television and cames he wants tends to bring your child closer<br/>\n&gt; to you and that that helped me and ds so much that most of our issues<br/>\n&gt; in the past are almost non issues at least in my eyes.  I learning<br/>\n&gt; more and more to care less what &#39;others&#39; think and that makes everyone<br/>\n&gt; in this family happier.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this helps, Rachel.  I don&#39;t post very much, one reason because<br/>\n&gt; I still afraid of hurting someone&#39;s feelings if I don&#39;t word things just<br/>\n&gt; so (one of my issues).  After my 4 month experience with ds in school and <br/>\n&gt; the &#39;expert&#39; I felt like I had to at least try to help through showing my <br/>\n&gt; own experience with what you are going through.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; HTH,<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: rachel_foodie [mailto:rachel_foodie@y...]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 13, 2004 2:34 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Please somebody H-E-L-P!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new to this list, but not new to homeschooling or unschooling. <br/>\n&gt; And jeesh, I just realized I gotta make this quick.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s the rundown:<br/>\n&gt; 3 kids : Andrew 14, Ben 7, and Autumn 4 next month.<br/>\n&gt; Andrew is my film maker. He&#39;s a quiet, yet hilarious kid whose life <br/>\n&gt; pretty much revolves around comedy.  Spongebob! SNL, Austin Powers, <br/>\n&gt; anything with Jim Carey, Will Ferrel, Mike Myers and of course Monty <br/>\n&gt; Python (within reason, as some of those actors films are too too <br/>\n&gt; sexually crude).  For the last 3 years he has been working thru Oak <br/>\n&gt; Meadow&#39;s curriculum (6th 7th and now 8th grade). He does this because <br/>\n&gt; my husband isn&#39;t the unschooler that I am. However, Andrew does it at <br/>\n&gt; his own pace, when he wants, and no one checks it. So God knows how <br/>\n&gt; much he&#39;s really done.  I don&#39;t care. However, Andrew wants to go to <br/>\n&gt; Highschool next year. Agh! He wants more &quot;socialization&quot;.  Basically, <br/>\n&gt; he wants to hang out with kids in his age range more than he gets a <br/>\n&gt; chance to.  I have tried talking him out of it. Telling him what crap <br/>\n&gt; it is. Reading sections of various  Gatto books to him.  But he wants <br/>\n&gt; to try it. So, I have to let him.  He is a fabulous kid. Just <br/>\n&gt; wonderful.  I love him to pieces and don&#39;t want to see anyone mess <br/>\n&gt; him up in anyway. However, if he wants to try it, we (my dh and I) <br/>\n&gt; have got to let him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me skip to Autumn.  She is 3 going on 4 next month, but might as <br/>\n&gt; well be going on 14!  She is smart as a whip and my wonderful, happy, <br/>\n&gt; beautiful little girlie!  She loves her brothers and they adore her. <br/>\n&gt; She has her Dad and me wrapped around her little finger. She can play <br/>\n&gt; on her own, has a great imagination, and picks things up fast.  She <br/>\n&gt; loves to play with other kids, especially other girls, and is a <br/>\n&gt; social butterfly.  I think she will flourish as an unschooler.  Oh <br/>\n&gt; yeah, she is still a bobaholic( my sons nursed til they were 5) and <br/>\n&gt; she still sleeps with us (of course...what else).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last is Ben.  He has Autistic Spectrum Disorder. He is in the mild-<br/>\n&gt; moderate zone. His diagnosis is atypical Aspergers. Ben is also most <br/>\n&gt; likely Dyslexic.  I never believed in that before, but the kid has <br/>\n&gt; absolutely no phonological awareness. He doesn&#39;t rhyme, he can&#39;t hear <br/>\n&gt; it. Along with ASD are host of issues; extreme anxiety (he&#39;s on <br/>\n&gt; Paxil), bedwetting that came out of NOWHERE after years of being dry <br/>\n&gt; (now he&#39;s on meds for that), and processing/attentional/hyperactivity <br/>\n&gt; that is so so so markedly corrected by yet again more meds that if <br/>\n&gt; you asked him questions on and then off the meds you&#39;d think you had <br/>\n&gt; been speaking to different kids. I am scared to death that <br/>\n&gt; unschooling may not be the way to go for Ben.  He really wants to <br/>\n&gt; read, but no matter how I try to help him nothing works.  Coming from <br/>\n&gt; a mom and dad who abhored lables we have had Ben tested by everyone <br/>\n&gt; imaginable: pediatricians, developmental pediatricians,  <br/>\n&gt; neurologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, <br/>\n&gt; chiropractors, nutritionists EVEN the county special ed dept <br/>\n&gt; etc.... . Before the meds we tried all the diets, various <br/>\n&gt; supplements, you name it.  He is our money sink.  He has had 2 years <br/>\n&gt; of speech and occupational therapy the latter of which worked really <br/>\n&gt; well. However, he still has problems with semantics-pragmatics <br/>\n&gt; (conversational speech). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  EVERYONE we speak to keeps saying he needs to go to school and get <br/>\n&gt; services from Special Ed and I am so torn. I have been rereading some <br/>\n&gt; of Gatto&#39;s essays and I just hate the institution of school.  <br/>\n&gt; However, I am beginning to wonder if Gatto was talking about mostly <br/>\n&gt; normal kids. Can the institution of school possibly help my son?  <br/>\n&gt; Granted he will have an IEP and I have already learned ALOT about how <br/>\n&gt; to get what he needs, even if that means squeezing blood from a stone.<br/>\n&gt; Of course, this past saturday, I was at the monthly ASD support group <br/>\n&gt; in my area, and then topic was on Special Ed and Public/Private or <br/>\n&gt; Home school. And the majority of the people there had kids in school <br/>\n&gt; and it was a bloody nightmare for them. It&#39;s like having another full <br/>\n&gt; time job just advocation for a special kid. Ugh!!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What all these &quot;experts&quot; (and I know that doesn&#39;t always mean much) <br/>\n&gt; are telling me is that Ben needs all the help he can get now. He <br/>\n&gt; needs structure and alot of repetition and drill (and I can hear you <br/>\n&gt; all collectively moaning) and these are all things I TOTALLY SUCK <br/>\n&gt; AT!!! My husband&#39;s nickname for me is QuADD (Queen of ADD, there <br/>\n&gt; should be an H in there to, I am a hypermama). I am horrible with <br/>\n&gt; anything resembling school.  However, if Ben stays home all he will <br/>\n&gt; do (because it&#39;s all he does now) is play GameCube, PC games or watch <br/>\n&gt; TV til his eyes fall out. Of course he is brilliant at all of it. <br/>\n&gt; Part of ASD is that he really isn&#39;t interested in being with other <br/>\n&gt; kids (unlike his brother and sister).  OH, he loves all of us <br/>\n&gt; intensely.  But doesn&#39;t really need or want friends in his opinion. <br/>\n&gt; He won&#39;t really engage in imaginative play on his own. Someone else <br/>\n&gt; has to start and sustain it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am EXHAUSTED at trying to do the right thing. I am such an idealist <br/>\n&gt; (which for what I am going thru is probably terrible).  I am <br/>\n&gt; amazingly flexible with all sorts of other things. But this school <br/>\n&gt; one is a toughie. I am grown up enough not to need someone elses <br/>\n&gt; approval. In the end I have to do what is right as I see fit by my <br/>\n&gt; son. It&#39;s just that noone, except for my husband, can give any input. <br/>\n&gt; Of my 3 best friend, only one homeschools. She is very supportive of <br/>\n&gt; me, but she doesn&#39;t have a special needs kid, and can&#39;t put herself <br/>\n&gt; entirely in my shoes. My other homeschooling friends are not really <br/>\n&gt; unschoolers. Which I guess I am not totally because of the Oak Meadow <br/>\n&gt; stuff (though in my heart I am one). So I am feeling very alone in <br/>\n&gt; this whole mess. I need someone who understands my point of view to <br/>\n&gt; hash this stuff out with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any of you have any advice or experience with this stuff. HA!

I did already read the Anne Ohman piece on Sandra&#39;s <br/>\nwebsite <br/>\nlate last night.   I even wrote to Anne. Then I forwarded a bunch of <br/>\nthe special needs articles there to my dh. I figured he could <br/>\nread &#39;em at work. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding unschooling and relaxed homeschooling. Someone mentioned to <br/>\njump in, the waters fine.  Oh, how I would love too!!!  It&#39;s not me <br/>\nholding me back. It&#39;s my honey (dh) he just can&#39;t let go. At some <br/>\npoint, one has to agree to disagree and move on from there. He wanted <br/>\nAndrew &quot;doing&quot; a curriculum, I didn&#39;t.  So, we looked for one that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t too horrible to Andrew or me, and Robert(dh) bought it. I told <br/>\nRobert that I am a mom, not a school teacher. So, I have nothing to <br/>\ndo with it. Interestingly, Robert doesn&#39;t have much to do with it <br/>\neither, except for asking Andrew occaisionally if he has done his <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew works on it whenever.  There have been days and days when he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.  Like I said, I don&#39;t care, because I wish he didn&#39;t have it <br/>\nat all. <br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately with Ben (at present) and Autumn, they pretty much do <br/>\nwhatever they want.  While I have been writing this they are in the <br/>\nshower, singing and soaping the whole thing to bits. Hey, at least <br/>\nthey and the shower will be clean! :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as a family we don&#39;t really have set meal times (I try with <br/>\ndinner because it is nice when we are all together), or bed times, or <br/>\nwake up times. All my kids have been child-led weaning. Family bed <br/>\netc... very LLL and Mothering magazine...all of which lead to me <br/>\nfinding John Holt and Growing Without Schooling (man, do I miss that <br/>\nmagazine). Anyway, our lifestyle is very unschooly, even if Andrew is <br/>\npresently not &quot;unschooled&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone also mentioned focusing on what they are brilliant at.  Thank <br/>\nyou so much for that!  In the last 2 months I have been so wrapped up <br/>\nin all Ben&#39;s problems, that I was starting to forget how absolutely <br/>\nwonderful he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan mentioned to someone what they thought of private therapy.  The <br/>\nreason why Ben was being evaluated for the umpteenth time is that he <br/>\nhas what is called the Katy Becket Deeming Waiver. It is a medicaid <br/>\nprogram that offsets the cost of private therapies. Before he got <br/>\nthat the costs were on the verge of breaking us. Also, Robert works <br/>\nfor IBM (we are <br/>\nin Atlanta) and they have a great program for special kids that pays <br/>\nfor 80% of things like private tutoring and therapy.  So we &quot;need&quot; <br/>\nall these tests to prove that he is eligible for help.  After 2 years <br/>\nof various therapies we took a break. It was exhausting for Ben, me <br/>\nand everyone else. But very rewarding.  Personally, I would rather do <br/>\nthe private stuff <br/>\nagain than go the school route.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes when people are discussing a special kid and how <br/>\nthey learn and others say, &quot;Focus on the good not the bad&quot; that is <br/>\nextremely useful to keep in one&#39;s head. However, some of the stuff <br/>\nthese precious kids go through is extremely painful to them and their <br/>\nparents.  My dh and I were VERY against meds for Ben.  But after 2+ <br/>\nyears of him being so very afraid of everything. So anxious, scared <br/>\nand freaked out, that he couldn&#39;t cope with much, we realized that, <br/>\nfor an ideal: of no kid on meds, we were letting our wonderful, sweet <br/>\nboy suffer needlessly. The OT he was receiving helped, but his <br/>\noverriding anxiety prevented it from &quot;sticking&quot; So, with much fear <br/>\nand trembling ourselves we tried medication and what happened was <br/>\nlike watching a flower on the verge of death come back to life and <br/>\nbloom so beautifully! So, there is a point where a loving parent may <br/>\nhave to do something to and for their child to make their child&#39;s <br/>\nlife better. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am very aware of the dangers of school.

You can read more on my current post (which is called &#39;worry about pessimism&#39;) as far as what concerns I have at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t had Jonathan in any therapy whatsoever.  We went through the IEP process, but it was the school&#39;s recommendation that he be placed in a special ed classroom full time with a one-on-one aide....and we said no.  He has so many sensory issues that school, itself, would not work for him.  Lights, noise, fire alarms, ringing bells, etc. would set him off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve ever seen the movie &quot;Rain Man&quot; -- there&#39;s a scene in the kitchen where the fire alarm/smoke detector goes off and Raymond is trying to get out of the kitchen while screaming, banging his head, etc. -- that is my son&#39;s reaction to any loud noise, especially the unexpected kind.  So school is not in his future!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son also loves his Game Cube and has a very warm, if unusual sense of humor.  He loves to tell jokes and will do a comedy monologue for anyone willing to listen!!  But I have really backed off within the last six months.  I require nothing of him.  No testing, no workbook pages, no books to read, etc.  He is SOOO much happier and I have had family and friends come up and ask me what I&#39;m doing with him to make this change!!  They&#39;re convinced it&#39;s because of some new medicine or therapy!  It&#39;s nothing more than unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he does nothing all day but play Game Cube, then that&#39;s okay.  He won&#39;t be a little boy forever.  He&#39;ll one day have a job and a mortgage and a partner telling him to take out the trash.  Let him be a child for a short period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is almost 13 and she&#39;s now starting to do things, on her own, that I never thought she would.  She *asked* for a pre-algebra math computer CD just after Christmas.  And has been working through the 600 some-odd problems, all on her own.  And this is my child who was math-phobic when we were doing school at home!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does take a lot of faith to make this step with an autistic child, or at least it has with mine!! <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my 13 year old, I have no worries.  I see her reading all the time.  I can hear the conversations we have about every subject under the sun.  I can hear her play her piano.  I can see her work through her math CD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no worries with my 4 year old.  He counts and adds all the time.  He&#39;s sounding out words all over the place.  He&#39;s always bringing me a book to read aloud to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with my autistic son, it&#39;s MUCH harder to look for those milestones!!  First, he tends to be in his own little world much of the time.  Second, he tends to learn very slowly and very gradually, so there are very few &#39;thunderbolts&#39; in the air when he understands something.  Third, there is VERY little support to unschooling autistic children.  I feel like a veritable pioneer here!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy MIL&#39;s comment was, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t he be in school so that he can learn to bag groceries like the little retarded boys at the grocery store?&quot;  I was livid!!!  That was the last time she&#39;s brought up education in my presence.  But that is what it was all about during my son&#39;s IEP.  &quot;How many basic skills can we get him to learn so that he can eventually be a happy and quiet mushroom?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is NOT what I want for my son!!!  He may never read novels -- he may never know his times tables off of the top of his head -- but he will be a HAPPY little boy --  and a HAPPY young man -- and a HAPPY adult, because he&#39;ll be the best that HE can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this was soooo long!!!

I was already a homeschooler <br/>\nand knew to question things but he was very<br/>\nconvincing and I was not feeling confident in <br/>\nmyself at all.**  I&#39;m glad we went to the counselor<br/>\nbecause dh was really questioning &#39;my&#39; determination<br/>\nthat ds was not to be spanked (I was spanked imo quite<br/>\na bit as a child, and dh was not)  Dh quit that talk<br/>\nbut I&#39;m not sure it was because of the counselor as much as<br/>\ndh being afraid that I&#39;d find another &#39;expert&#39; if he<br/>\nstarted that talk again.  &lt;g&gt;  To this day dh says <br/>\nthe &#39;expect&#39; didn&#39;t help us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDs did not want to go to school but I basically manipulated<br/>\nhim into thinking that he &#39;wanted&#39; to go because of<br/>\nthe &#39;experts&#39; opinion.  I wouldn&#39;t &#39;make&#39; him go so <br/>\nI did it in an unhanded way (the expert didn&#39;t seem to<br/>\nsee any &#39;issue&#39; with this by the way).  :o(<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool did seem to help us at first but I now think of how <br/>\nappearances are so deceptive.  For us, the reason ds <br/>\nwent to school wasn&#39;t actually &#39;fixed&#39;.  Ds had to learn<br/>\ndifferent coping mechanisms at school without his mom<br/>\nfor his aggressiveness (he didn&#39;t hurt other kids just acted<br/>\nvery mad even at the littlest thing).  I didn&#39;t know or even <br/>\nthink to ask if they would discipline him in some way, I&#39;d assumed <br/>\nthat the school would never discipline my child without<br/>\nasking me.  Well, I guess time out in a certain area (the<br/>\nopen closet) is not something you need to tell the parents.  <br/>\nIt was during a family meeting at the school I learned how<br/>\nds hardly has to do to the time area anymore.  How humiliated<br/>\nand embarrassed my little boy must have been.  :o(   I&#39;ve since<br/>\nlearned how much both my dc are highly sensitive.  Ds more so<br/>\nthan dd and I can only wonder now if that&#39;s because of his time<br/>\nin school.  Anyway, I now feel like like I have more things to <br/>\nwork through with ds than I did before he went to school.  <br/>\nMany more negatives came out of school than positives imo.  <br/>\n<br/>\n**I&#39;d read many, many parenting books by this time<br/>\nand that&#39;s why I felt confused and didn&#39;t trust myself or listen<br/>\nclosely to what ds wanted imo (Lyle mentioned something about<br/>\nthis very recently).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the traditional school classes for some &#39;special&#39; ed kids is <br/>\na good thing but after my experience I&#39;m hard pressed to think so.<br/>\nIf I still felt the need for help with ds or doubted myself again<br/>\nI&#39;d try to find something that we could do without sending my child<br/>\noff to school everyday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, try to read some of Sandra Dodd&#39;s pages about unschooling with<br/>\ngames and television.  There is a way that you and ds can have<br/>\nyour cake and eat it too.  &lt;g&gt;  Letting ds do what he wants to do incl.<br/>\nall the television and cames he wants tends to bring your child closer<br/>\nto you and that that helped me and ds so much that most of our issues<br/>\nin the past are almost non issues at least in my eyes.

He&#39;s a quiet, yet hilarious kid whose life <br/>\npretty much revolves around comedy.  Spongebob! SNL, Austin Powers, <br/>\nanything with Jim Carey, Will Ferrel, Mike Myers and of course Monty <br/>\nPython (within reason, as some of those actors films are too too <br/>\nsexually crude).  For the last 3 years he has been working thru Oak <br/>\nMeadow&#39;s curriculum (6th 7th and now 8th grade). He does this because <br/>\nmy husband isn&#39;t the unschooler that I am. However, Andrew does it at <br/>\nhis own pace, when he wants, and no one checks it. So God knows how <br/>\nmuch he&#39;s really done.  I don&#39;t care. However, Andrew wants to go to <br/>\nHighschool next year. Agh! He wants more &quot;socialization&quot;.  Basically, <br/>\nhe wants to hang out with kids in his age range more than he gets a <br/>\nchance to.  I have tried talking him out of it. Telling him what crap <br/>\nit is. Reading sections of various  Gatto books to him.  But he wants <br/>\nto try it. So, I have to let him.  He is a fabulous kid. Just <br/>\nwonderful.  I love him to pieces and don&#39;t want to see anyone mess <br/>\nhim up in anyway. However, if he wants to try it, we (my dh and I) <br/>\nhave got to let him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me skip to Autumn.  She is 3 going on 4 next month, but might as <br/>\nwell be going on 14!  She is smart as a whip and my wonderful, happy, <br/>\nbeautiful little girlie!  She loves her brothers and they adore her. <br/>\nShe has her Dad and me wrapped around her little finger. She can play <br/>\non her own, has a great imagination, and picks things up fast.  She <br/>\nloves to play with other kids, especially other girls, and is a <br/>\nsocial butterfly.  I think she will flourish as an unschooler.  Oh <br/>\nyeah, she is still a bobaholic( my sons nursed til they were 5) and <br/>\nshe still sleeps with us (of course...what else).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast is Ben.  He has Autistic Spectrum Disorder. He is in the mild-<br/>\nmoderate zone. His diagnosis is atypical Aspergers. Ben is also most <br/>\nlikely Dyslexic.  I never believed in that before, but the kid has <br/>\nabsolutely no phonological awareness. He doesn&#39;t rhyme, he can&#39;t hear <br/>\nit. Along with ASD are host of issues; extreme anxiety (he&#39;s on <br/>\nPaxil), bedwetting that came out of NOWHERE after years of being dry <br/>\n(now he&#39;s on meds for that), and processing/attentional/hyperactivity <br/>\nthat is so so so markedly corrected by yet again more meds that if <br/>\nyou asked him questions on and then off the meds you&#39;d think you had <br/>\nbeen speaking to different kids. I am scared to death that <br/>\nunschooling may not be the way to go for Ben.  He really wants to <br/>\nread, but no matter how I try to help him nothing works.  Coming from <br/>\na mom and dad who abhored lables we have had Ben tested by everyone <br/>\nimaginable: pediatricians, developmental pediatricians,  <br/>\nneurologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, <br/>\nchiropractors, nutritionists EVEN the county special ed dept <br/>\netc.... . Before the meds we tried all the diets, various <br/>\nsupplements, you name it.  He is our money sink.  He has had 2 years <br/>\nof speech and occupational therapy the latter of which worked really <br/>\nwell. However, he still has problems with semantics-pragmatics <br/>\n(conversational speech). <br/>\n<br/>\n EVERYONE we speak to keeps saying he needs to go to school and get <br/>\nservices from Special Ed and I am so torn. I have been rereading some <br/>\nof Gatto&#39;s essays and I just hate the institution of school.  <br/>\nHowever, I am beginning to wonder if Gatto was talking about mostly <br/>\nnormal kids. Can the institution of school possibly help my son?  <br/>\nGranted he will have an IEP and I have already learned ALOT about how <br/>\nto get what he needs, even if that means squeezing blood from a stone.<br/>\nOf course, this past saturday, I was at the monthly ASD support group <br/>\nin my area, and then topic was on Special Ed and Public/Private or <br/>\nHome school. And the majority of the people there had kids in school <br/>\nand it was a bloody nightmare for them. It&#39;s like having another full <br/>\ntime job just advocation for a special kid. Ugh!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat all these &quot;experts&quot; (and I know that doesn&#39;t always mean much) <br/>\nare telling me is that Ben needs all the help he can get now. He <br/>\nneeds structure and alot of repetition and drill (and I can hear you <br/>\nall collectively moaning) and these are all things I TOTALLY SUCK <br/>\nAT!!! My husband&#39;s nickname for me is QuADD (Queen of ADD, there <br/>\nshould be an H in there to, I am a hypermama). I am horrible with <br/>\nanything resembling school.  However, if Ben stays home all he will <br/>\ndo (because it&#39;s all he does now) is play GameCube, PC games or watch <br/>\nTV til his eyes fall out. Of course he is brilliant at all of it. <br/>\nPart of ASD is that he really isn&#39;t interested in being with other <br/>\nkids (unlike his brother and sister).  OH, he loves all of us <br/>\nintensely.  But doesn&#39;t really need or want friends in his opinion. <br/>\nHe won&#39;t really engage in imaginative play on his own. Someone else <br/>\nhas to start and sustain it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am EXHAUSTED at trying to do the right thing. I am such an idealist <br/>\n(which for what I am going thru is probably terrible).  I am <br/>\namazingly flexible with all sorts of other things. But this school <br/>\none is a toughie. I am grown up enough not to need someone elses <br/>\napproval. In the end I have to do what is right as I see fit by my <br/>\nson. It&#39;s just that noone, except for my husband, can give any input. <br/>\nOf my 3 best friend, only one homeschools. She is very supportive of <br/>\nme, but she doesn&#39;t have a special needs kid, and can&#39;t put herself <br/>\nentirely in my shoes. My other homeschooling friends are not really <br/>\nunschoolers. Which I guess I am not totally because of the Oak Meadow <br/>\nstuff (though in my heart I am one). So I am feeling very alone in <br/>\nthis whole mess.

It is extremely difficult to get <br/>\ntheir needs met, even with an IEP.  One problem in a ps environment <br/>\nis that asperger children are delayed in some areas yet extremely <br/>\ngifted in others.  Most schools want to stick them in special ed and <br/>\nkeep them there.  So, lets say your child is mathmatically gifted.  <br/>\nThey will make him do simple addition touch math when he knows how <br/>\nto do algebra.  Or, he can read on a 10th grade level, but because <br/>\nhe is only 8 and in special ed, he will be forced to read see spot <br/>\nrun.  I&#39;m not making this up.  These are real examples.

He&#39;s a quiet, yet hilarious kid whose life <br/>\npretty much revolves around comedy.  Spongebob! SNL, Austin Powers, <br/>\nanything with Jim Carey, Will Ferrel, Mike Myers and of course Monty <br/>\nPython (within reason, as some of those actors films are too too <br/>\nsexually crude).  For the last 3 years he has been working thru Oak <br/>\nMeadow&#39;s curriculum (6th 7th and now 8th grade). He does this because <br/>\nmy husband isn&#39;t the unschooler that I am. However, Andrew does it at <br/>\nhis own pace, when he wants, and no one checks it. So God knows how <br/>\nmuch he&#39;s really done.  I don&#39;t care. However, Andrew wants to go to <br/>\nHighschool next year. Agh! He wants more &quot;socialization&quot;.  Basically, <br/>\nhe wants to hang out with kids in his age range more than he gets a <br/>\nchance to.  I have tried talking him out of it. Telling him what crap <br/>\nit is. Reading sections of various  Gatto books to him.  But he wants <br/>\nto try it. So, I have to let him.  He is a fabulous kid. Just <br/>\nwonderful.  I love him to pieces and don&#39;t want to see anyone mess <br/>\nhim up in anyway. However, if he wants to try it, we (my dh and I) <br/>\nhave got to let him.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me skip to Autumn.  She is 3 going on 4 next month, but might as <br/>\nwell be going on 14!  She is smart as a whip and my wonderful, happy, <br/>\nbeautiful little girlie!  She loves her brothers and they adore her. <br/>\nShe has her Dad and me wrapped around her little finger. She can play <br/>\non her own, has a great imagination, and picks things up fast.  She <br/>\nloves to play with other kids, especially other girls, and is a <br/>\nsocial butterfly.  I think she will flourish as an unschooler.
