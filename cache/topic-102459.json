Or maybe it was the unschooling boards or alwayslearning.  I know that it WAS somewhere unschooling that I first heard of an ocarina.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday my husband, Pat, worked on a new project of placing boards in a crawl space above the utility room to give us storage for things like Christmas decorations or other things that we store but rarely need access to.  As part of the process, he went through boxes stored in the garage and moved some of them to the new space.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, he put an object onto the kitchen counter, but didn&#39;t say anything.  When I looked at it, my first thought was some sort of smoking implement.  I asked him about it and he said it was some musical thing.  Then I thought, Ocarina!  I did a web search and found some that look similar.  It looks sort of like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.grothmusic.com/cgi-local/SoftCart.exe/online-store/scstore/p-IA0718.html?L+scstore+xzzt1866ffaca3ac+1105328956\">http://www.grothmusic.com/cgi-local/SoftCart.exe/online-store/scstore/p-IA0718.html?L+scstore+xzzt1866ffaca3ac+1105328956</a><br/>\nbut with an additional 8 holes on the other side.  I can&#39;t quite figure out how to hold it.  The way that seems logical at first results in my smallest fingers going on the largest holes.  It is made of clay and painted and has markings that I can&#39;t really make out.  Possibly says made in Africa.  He thinks he bought it in the early to mid-70s at an auction his parents used to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says he bought it because he thought it looked cool and it made music.  He also has an old thumb piano and a xylophone-type wooden thing that has only 6 notes, instead of the 8 I am used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other musical happenings, I am taking a 2 month beginning guitar class through our local parks and rec.  I&#39;d been playing around with some teach-yourself books, but decided I&#39;d benefit from a regular class to get some human tips and have that motivation to *have-to* practice between classes.  The instructor is part of a local musical duo that I&#39;ve heard play many times locally.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.owt.com/humphrey/huha/\">http://users.owt.com/humphrey/huha/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLisa and Jackie both say they&#39;d like to learn to play guitar too and have played around some with the 2 chords I showed them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102493,"nextTopicId":102401}}
