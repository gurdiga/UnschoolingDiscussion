They approach the issues of character education from a variety<br/>\n&gt; of directions, including a highly suggestive American Indian perspective<br/>\n&gt; that has been far too little understood in our culture. This book is a<br/>\n&gt; stimulating and thoughtful contribution to character education.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Noam Chomsky (Language and the Problem of Knowledge, Manufacturing<br/>\n&gt; Consent, et al)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Teaching Virtues is a fundamental and welcomed change in educational<br/>\n&gt; approaches to building character.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Vine Deloria, Jr. (Spirit and Reason, Red Earth, White Lies, Custer Died<br/>\n&gt; for Your Sins)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;The authors invite the reader to think outside the box as they<br/>\n&gt; construct an innovative model for character, drawing from the great<br/>\n&gt; spiritual traditions of First Nations people of North American.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Larry Brendtro, (Reclaiming Youth at Risk, Positive Peer Culture)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Here is an educational approach that honors the interconnectedness of<br/>\n&gt; the world and helps our young people engage it with wisdom and<br/>\n&gt; integrity. This book is a refreshing perspective on character education.<br/>\n&gt; Ron Miller (What Are Schools For? Holistic Education in American<br/>\n&gt; Culture)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;We give our highest endorsement to Teaching Virtues.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Mary Williams and Ed De Rouche, Directors of The University of San Diego<br/>\n&gt; &#39;s International Center For Character Education. (Educating for Hearts<br/>\n&gt; and Minds)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Teaching Virtues adds to understanding of the connections between the<br/>\n&gt; teaching of virtues and the practice or moral reciprocity within<br/>\n&gt; community. The authors specific recommendations for reforming the<br/>\n&gt; curriculum are much needed at this time.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; C.A. Bowers (Educating for An Ecologically Sustainable Future, The<br/>\n&gt; Culture of Denial)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Brilliantly written, utterly practical. Will make the world a better<br/>\n&gt; place&quot;- Thom Hartman ADD: A Different Perception)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This book offers a new but ancient perspective on teaching virtues. Like<br/>\n&gt; the American Indian people who practiced it for thousands of years, it<br/>\n&gt; does not allow us to separate character from content, and by this, makes<br/>\n&gt; it possible for us all to &quot;walk the talk.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; --Sunita Gandhi, President-Worker, The Council for Global Education and<br/>\n&gt; Dignity<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
