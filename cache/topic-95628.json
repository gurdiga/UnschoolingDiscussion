You might even find that kids in this kind of <br/>\nenvironment have very different experiences with regards to sharing <br/>\nthan we grew up with. My kids share in ways that I don&#39;t think I ever <br/>\nwould&#39;ve with my siblings or friends. They aren&#39;t afraid to give <br/>\nthings away, to share from the heart, or to combine things with each <br/>\nother. This year, they combined all of their Lego, which surprised <br/>\nme, but they play together even more since they did that. Also, they <br/>\neach share, trade, and give things away to their friends all the <br/>\ntime. We have an unschooling family that just moved in across the <br/>\nstreet with two kids (yes, how lucky are we???!!!), and all four kids <br/>\ndecided this week to combine their Pokemon cards. I have to bite my <br/>\ntongue sometimes to keep from interrupting these amazing acts. I keep <br/>\nhaving to stuff down negative thoughts of how it might not work out, <br/>\nthey will want to have their own cards back, etc. They are operating <br/>\nin an entirely different universe than I grew up in, why shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nthey act in different ways? In any case, the Pokemon cards are in a <br/>\ngiant folder that travels back and forth from the other family&#39;s <br/>\nhouse to ours, and so far there hasn&#39;t been any problems. They have <br/>\nalso combined some of their money to purchase a new mega-pack of <br/>\ncards. If they have future problems in sharing this stuff, maybe us <br/>\nadults will have to help them work it out. Then again, maybe we <br/>\nshould just sit back and learn from them. I think they&#39;re operating <br/>\non a more community-minded approach, something like the Northwest <br/>\nIndian&#39;s potlatch system. We grew up with the &quot;every man for himself&quot; <br/>\napproach instead. We could all learn from their ability to share, I <br/>\nthink. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting, how much the common culture prepares us for <br/>\nthese &quot;truths&quot; about childhood - how kids are selfish and have to be <br/>\ntaught to share, how they have to be &quot;motivated&quot; to learn, how they <br/>\nwill be jealous of a new baby. My experience is that kids can act <br/>\nlike this at times, but are also capable of generosity of spirit, <br/>\nunmitigated desire to learn, and a capacity to share that is beyond <br/>\nthat which most adults experience. More than anything, we can learn <br/>\nthese things from them, not the other way &#39;round.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Telling about baby","postDate":"1086892560","msgId":95663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4LjJjZTgxNjg5LjJkZmEwNDEwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":95660,"nextInTopic":95665,"prevInTime":95662,"nextInTime":95664,"topicId":95628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/10/04 10:32:58 AM, julie@bravewriter.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1677828019\">In a message dated 6/10/04 10:32:58 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Certainly, but I tend to think that unschooling families are more <br/>\ncomparable to LLL <br/>\n<br/>\nfamilies THAN the mainstream. :) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYES and it&#39;s wonderful. &lt; g&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"Jennifer","from":"&quot;Jennifer&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Telling about baby","postDate":"1086890916","msgId":95660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhYTgzNCs5aGQ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNhYTc3NCtoaHY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95659,"nextInTopic":95663,"prevInTime":95659,"nextInTime":95661,"topicId":95628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... free ...

The moment Nicholette was born, that was gone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring my pregnancy, we shared her excitement.  When I pulled out <br/>\nHaleigh&#39;s baby clothes, it was fun to talk about how cute Haleigh <br/>\nwas in this outfit or share a funny experience about that outfit.  <br/>\nWe set aside some of the keepsake outfits and I asked Haleigh to <br/>\nhelp me pick out a few special new outfits for Nicholette when we <br/>\nwent shopping.

A baby to love, a baby to hold, a baby to feed,&quot; etc. <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought Orion (23 mo when baby came) was going to be very <br/>\nresentful of baby, but I tried hard to keep that idea to myself.  No <br/>\nresentment.  Just wonder, joy, and awe.  He amazes me daily with his <br/>\nlove.  Julie&#39;s story about the fire truck resonated; when Isaac was <br/>\na few days old, Orion asked to hold him.  I had wrapped gifts for <br/>\nthem when he was born from dh, baby, and me, quiet things I could do <br/>\nwith them on the couch.  Orion had gotten a marble maze; as soon as <br/>\nI got baby settled in his arms, Orion thrust him at the <br/>\nmaze.  &quot;Baby, game?&quot; he said.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t spend a lot of time preparing for positive and negative, <br/>\nbut rather answer your son&#39;s questions as they naturally evolve <br/>\nthrough your preg.

I just didn&#39;t want to put negative ideas in the<br/>\ngirls&#39; heads that they wouldn&#39;t necessarily feel themselves.  Now that he<br/>\nhas been here for a year, they are well aware of how a baby can take up my<br/>\ntime, and how (especially now) they pull hair, etc...  We have dealt with<br/>\ntheir feelings regarding the baby as they have come up, by listening and<br/>\nhelping them to find ways to get their needs met too, and they do not<br/>\nquestion Evan&#39;s right to membership in this family.  He is simply part of<br/>\nthe family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I just want to say that I think it&#39;s best to not create problems<br/>\nwhere there may not be.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Andrea<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Evan was born at home, too, and my daughter, Stella, who was 3 at the<br/>\ntime, was absolutely fascinated by the whole process, from pre-natal visits<br/>\nto the midwives and listening to the heartbeat, to her job of discovering<br/>\nand announcing whether the baby was a girl or boy.  My midwives refer to her<br/>\nas &quot;little midwife&quot; or &quot;our second apprentice.&quot;  She was always full of<br/>\nquestions about the what the baby looked like inside me at each visit and<br/>\nsuch.  She was thrilled when she saw he was a boy, saying &quot;Now I have a<br/>\nbrother, too!&quot;  And like someone else said about their birth, Stella&#39;s was<br/>\nthe first voice Evan turned to, and the one he turned to the most, as well.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sheila Terry&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheilat111@...\">sheilat111@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 10, 2004 4:30 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Telling about baby<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I just reread Siblings Without Rivalry, I think if you read that it would<br/>\nhelp you alot with ways to talk to him about the baby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m thinking I want to present things &quot;equally&quot; a<br/>\n&gt; positive and a not-so-positive together so that it comes together<br/>\nbalanced.

Having the sling meant that she came <br/>\neverywhere we did and so she didn&#39;t alter our day-to-day lives all <br/>\nthat much. Nursing times either he nursed too or we read books.

My son came to the <br/>\nmidwife&#39;s appointments with me, and although he had been playing in <br/>\nour living room with my sister when I was in labor in our bedroom, <br/>\nabout 2 minutes before Asa was born, he turned to my sister and <br/>\nsaid &quot;Mom needs me there now, I better go.&quot; He came in to the bedroom <br/>\nand watched the baby being born. And his voice was the first one she <br/>\nturned to, he was so thrilled with that.

After ten years of La Leche League work and my five kids (and the <br/>\nhuge number of families I know), the dire predictions of anger and resentment associated <br/>\nwith going from one to two or two to three are much exaggerated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best preparation, imho, is enthusisam yourself. Let him in on doctor or midwife visits <br/>\nwhen there&#39;s a heartbeat to hear, involve him in picking out baby blankets and soft toys, <br/>\ntalk about how he can be a help to you, discuss how your routine will change (perhaps <br/>\nnow story time reading will happen with a baby nursing in one arm...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing: he won&#39;t be sharing his toys for a long long time with a baby. By the time <br/>\nthat happens, the baby won&#39;t be new, she will be a fact of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son had a metal fire truck that he loved. When our daughter was born (literally <br/>\ndays old), he was just over two. One evening, while I was making dinner, I heard a clunk. I <br/>\nturned around and saw that he had just tossed his truck into the baby&#39;s Moses basket <br/>\nwhile she slept (thankfully missing her head!). <br/>\n<br/>\nSome moms might have interpreted that as his resenting his little sister. But what I figured <br/>\nout immediately is that he *wanted* to share his most valuable toy with his new baby <br/>\nsister.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was smiling and peering over the edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spoke to him about saftey and toy choices and thanked him for his heart of generosity. I <br/>\nwas touched.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum up - I think kids raised with joy and wonder about new siblings whose mothers are <br/>\nat home, often have less difficulty with adding new babies than the culture predicts.
