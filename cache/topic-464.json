What this means is that if your child&#39;s birthday is in November, <br/>\nyou do not need to do ANYTHING until the FOLLOWING year, when she would be 8 <br/>\nat the school entry deadline.  Does that make sense?  Another way.  If your <br/>\ndd turned 5 in November, she would not have attended school that year, as the <br/>\ncutoff date is Sept. 18th(?).  So, apply that rule to when she turns 8, and <br/>\nthat is when you need to register, and test.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"David Albert","from":"David Albert &lt;shantinik@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lPDnzUDMCPZXUc-L1HaGuqdeKjzkXWyWMvuxYjXB1bde5rA6IPWx1-El2aJYrBGdTsjvHXG3YqtM0edOTtkDJHpnEpBVWE8_v4-wylU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 48","postDate":"928539091","msgId":469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy41MC40NjkuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":464,"nextInTopic":512,"prevInTime":468,"nextInTime":470,"topicId":464,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have been trying to catch up on mailing list before I<br/>\nintroduce myself, but cant&#39; seem to catch up, so here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a unschooling my 2 kids in Central Washington state.  My son,<br/>\nSkyler is 8 years old, and my daughter, Cheyenne is 6.  Since my oldest<br/>\nwas a baby, I was curious about homeschooking and that is when I first<br/>\nstarted to read about it(read some John Holt & others).  It sounded<br/>\nwonderful to me, but I didn&#39;t think about it too seriously since it<br/>\nseemed I had all the time in the world(before school age)back then. <br/>\nMeanwhile, I realize now, I was unschooling both of my children since<br/>\nbirth.  <br/>\n\tThe first day of school arrived much quicker than I could&#39;ve imagined. <br/>\nI had a lot of mixed feelings, but my son did attend Kindergarten.  I<br/>\nwas very layed back with my son when he was in Kindergarten, allowing<br/>\nhim to stay home often for &quot;no good reason&quot;:), and his baby sister and I<br/>\nwould volunteer in the classroom at least once a week.  This went O.K.<br/>\nand it was only 2 1/2 hours a day.  I noticed right away that he was<br/>\nprobably the only child in the classroom(30 kids) that had never<br/>\nattended some sort of daycare or preschool.  I couldn&#39;t believe it!  I<br/>\nnoticed he got very little 1-to-1 attention from his teacher, as she had<br/>\n29 other 5/6 year old to attend to, and many of them needed help(which<br/>\nis why the teachers like students like Skyler, who listen well, follow<br/>\ndirections, learn quickly, and work independently), because they don&#39;t<br/>\nneed the attention.  I was actually told this one day.  Maybe that is<br/>\nwhen I started thinking more about homeschooling?  For me, my early<br/>\nschool years were fairly pleasant.  I liked school, until I got older,<br/>\nfor the most part, always did well, and was usually the teachers pet.  I<br/>\nexcelled at school, I suppose you could say.   I just didn&#39;t want to<br/>\ndecide to homeschool, in case my son might like school.<br/>\n\tThen, when my son started 1st grade, I think our little unschooled<br/>\nfamily went into some sort of culture shock, hehee!  Seriously, he was 7<br/>\nyrs.old, and suddenly he was gone for 7+hours a day, 5 days a week.  Boy<br/>\ndid this take some major adjusting.  I was very depressed at first, but<br/>\nI adjusted.  My kids adjusted too, they grew apart, and started<br/>\nquarelling more.  My son would be very tired, and irritable upon coming<br/>\nhome.  He was always so tired, and didn&#39;t like school much at all.  He<br/>\nsaid they always had to sit still on the floor for long periods of time,<br/>\nand listen a lot, and he was bored.  One thing my son rarely was back<br/>\nthen(at home) was bored.  So, I went once and observed.  50<br/>\nstudents(ages 6-8), 2 teachers.  It was enough to convince me I had to<br/>\nmake a decision.  I basicly let my son make the decision, and he<br/>\ndecided, rather easily(more easily than I), he wanted to come home.  He<br/>\nalso got picked on on the playground by some older kids, and teased<br/>\nabout having curly hair(after which he always wanted it cut very short,<br/>\nand became overly self-conscious, I feel).  So, even that short<br/>\nexperiencs with the ps, had some negative consequences.  I am just so<br/>\ngrateful that I decided to pull him out of ps as soon as I did, and had<br/>\nthe courage to go through with it, because I was very unsure at first.  <br/>\n\tSince that time(year and 1/2), I have thought about using curiculum,<br/>\nbut in my indecision, have wound up unschooling.  I love the philosophy<br/>\nof child led natural learning, and really it&#39;s so simple because it&#39;s<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve been doing all along.  I just need to learn to trust myself,<br/>\nmy own intuition, and this process more.  The support of this group will<br/>\nsurely help immensley.<br/>\n\tI have a 2 questions:  (1)do I have to report my 8 year old to the<br/>\nschool district?  I have not yet filled out any paperwork or notified<br/>\nthem that he is homeschooling.  When am I supposed to do this?<br/>\n(2)I&#39;ve heard some about testing.  Is it required and when and how?
