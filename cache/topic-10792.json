Also his over-stimulation often happens when it is just he and I, or his brother and him, or the three of us.  No tv, no radio on, no telephone ringing, a quiet street/neighborhood, and maybe 1 neighbor child to play with, occassionally.  He is Soooooooo sensative.  He needs to be alone, IMHO, because he was already with us and that was too much apparently.  I hate to imagine what would happen if I was going to send him to school.  Good thing I decided to homeschool before he was ever concieved.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan wilson","from":"susan wilson &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"d63wCx7QNg9IvPb9xy8dpWyIhjx4mTnB8cMUb1CjvyrWRCpoqkwdFzVCJNYo27gEhMC4vHcnlgyaKqQwfMe_k4Sr_tFeaOTF","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:[Unschooling-dotcom]spirited & easy going (was homesty)","postDate":"963005837","msgId":10792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzA3MjEzNC5RQUExMzY0OEBidW55aXAuZmxhc2gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10836,"prevInTime":10791,"nextInTime":10793,"topicId":10792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... and ... to get ... seems ... than ... going, ... i have a friend whose dd s are this way.  as young children one was really difficult, aggressive to the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-274143708\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; He is exceptionally stubborn, spirited and hyperactive.
