You can find everything from current collectibles (like tons of<br/>\nbeanie babies) to retro items, clothing, jewelery, hardware, art, games,<br/>\netc, etc.  Most are gently used, but there is also a lot of new stuff<br/>\navailable.  I bought some dragon beanies as party favors for my son&#39;s bday<br/>\ncoming up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe castle I got from another fav. site, eToys.com.  It&#39;s a really great<br/>\ntoy site for those of us with little ones who cannot sneak out to the store<br/>\nwithout them very easily.  It&#39;s like having a toy super-store at your<br/>\nfingertips.  I can shop when they are napping or after bedtime, get the<br/>\ntoys in the mail, and open the boxes when they are asleep as well.  Then I<br/>\nwrap them and hide them and they are never the wiser!  He he...  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a wish list going on etoys that I periodically add to or delete<br/>\nfrom, or buy things from.  It&#39;s a great way for me to put together lists<br/>\nfor my boys, complete with prices and pictures.  You can convert your wish<br/>\nlist into a regisrty for friends and relatives who are online to use, but I<br/>\nprefer to use mine to organize my own shopping.  eToys is also a great<br/>\nplace to find unique and hard to find toys that are not at your local<br/>\nToy-R-Us.  Our list includes a set of wooden &quot;castle blocks,&quot; a great<br/>\nwooden drum with a skin head, an instrument set that inclused wind AND<br/>\nrhythm instruments that are very functional yet good for toddlers (hard to<br/>\nfind,) some really nice wooden peg puzzles, and hard to find videos.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few other sites I enjoy for toy shopping are: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ttgo.com\">http://www.ttgo.com</a> <br/>\nToys to Grow On<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.somedayisle.com/\">http://www.somedayisle.com/</a><br/>\nToys from Samedayisle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.justpretend.com/\">http://www.justpretend.com/</a><br/>\nFantasy, Make Believe, and Dress Up<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gummylump.com/\">http://www.gummylump.com/</a><br/>\nWooden toys and Blocks from Gummylump<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more grown up gift shopping I also like:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://renaissance-faire.com/shop/Market-Place.htm\">http://renaissance-faire.com/shop/Market-Place.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.celticweaver.com/\">http://www.celticweaver.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.phoenixlair.com/\">http://www.phoenixlair.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.qvc.com/asp/frameset.asp\">http://www.qvc.com/asp/frameset.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nto name a few....:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MORELFAM@xxx.xxx","from":"MORELFAM@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"JAhlF3hjzjCkEqeaYWEDsf3tkNR0oejF-e39Fq4Ys2BESCVdFMJ71dS03k0h3K4062qxKyYukw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"shopping on the web","postDate":"942640782","msgId":4551,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yOTguNDU1MS45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4574,"prevInTime":4550,"nextInTime":4552,"topicId":4551,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"nanci k, was it you who bought the used coat and toy castle?  would you share some favorite shopping sites for those of us who are novice web shoppers? thnx!
