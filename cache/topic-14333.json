This was mainly my idea and, at <br/>\nfirst, my husband would complain about the increase in our grocery bill <br/>\n(about $25 per week). Now he has gotten used to it. Plus, he sees that we <br/>\nactually buy less junk and throw away less food. Our choices are more <br/>\ndeliberate. We used to buy large quantities of things because they were on <br/>\nsale, stockpile them (esp. canned goods) for future use or assume we could <br/>\neat that much (with a family of only three!), then throw them away months <br/>\nlater when they had passed their expiration dates or had rotted in the <br/>\nrefrigerator.  It was a waste. Now we eat almost everything we buy before <br/>\nour next shopping trip. I am working on using less paper, plastic and <br/>\ncleaners. My son is learning along with us, about the ingredients in foods <br/>\nand recycling, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right about consumer support of environmentally-friendly items <br/>\nbeing important. I think it will eventually bring the prices down; someone <br/>\nhas to start somewhere if that is what one supports.  I have been reading a <br/>\nlot about organic cotton and hemp and would love to see more products made <br/>\nof these materials, but the prices now are so high that they are <br/>\nprohibitive for most of us. It is really hard to justify (esp. to DH) <br/>\nspending $50 for a pair of organic cotton pants when I could get the same, <br/>\nnon-organic pair at a discount store for $15.

One can practice cooperative socialism or the like, but may <br/>\nonly take it so far when the econemy and social structure in which <br/>\none exists is capitalist.  I recently whent on a search for a <br/>\nsocially responsible mutual fund.  I looked at Pax, Domini, and the <br/>\nrest, adn was satisfied with none.  Nike here, Wal-mart there, Intel <br/>\nover there.  I expressed my frustration to a long-time socialist and <br/>\nwa-resistor.  He basically told me the same thing I am stating here.  <br/>\nOne cannot live purely in a socialist of communist or anarchist way <br/>\nunless one is living on land far away from society and self-<br/>\nsustaining.  There is a community like this in Denmark, Christiana (I <br/>\nthink I spelled that right).  Ther are pretty much a self-sustaining <br/>\ncommunity.  And the Danish government leaves them alone.  Of course, <br/>\nDenmark is socialist (as is Sweeden, Norway, France, Germany, . . .)  <br/>\nYou would never see that in this country.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat one must do then is to use the power of the consumerm, the laws <br/>\nof supply and demand, to force the economy further in the wanted <br/>\ndirection.  Just like what you are asking.  Take hemp papere for <br/>\nexample.  Demand is low, supply is low, prices are high.  If however, <br/>\ndemand were to increase, and systenms were developed to mass produce <br/>\nhemp paper, it would cost less than wood paper today (the production <br/>\nrequires less resources).  It&#39;s hard because most often those of us <br/>\nwho wish for that utopian economy are those who can afford the higher <br/>\nprices of &quot;buying right&quot;.  Instead our pocket books tell us to go to <br/>\nWal-mart instead of the family business on the corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I&#39;m rambling (it is just too hard to express a truly solid <br/>\nargument for these without writing a book; everything is integral to <br/>\nthe everything else).  The points are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  If you live in today&#39;s America, you have to participate in <br/>\nconsumerism to survive. The question is to what degree should you <br/>\nparticipate in consumerism (X-mas is all about profits as far as the <br/>\nmarkets are concerned, but that is another story).<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  One must support food coops, art coops, and the rest whenever <br/>\npossible to increase awareness, drive down prices in that market, and <br/>\ndecrease revenues in others.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeamus<br/>\n<br/>\n======================================================================<br/>\nSee Jane.
