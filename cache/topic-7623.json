If you are still teaching, how do your colleagues react?  Why did you<br/>\ndecide to do it? What out of your teaching training/experience turned out to be<br/>\nuseful, and what useless? How&#39;s it going? other reflections?  (and then the<br/>\nusual, where are you, how many kids, what age, what did you teach, etc.)<br/>\n500-2000 words will be fine, and don&#39;t worry too much about editing -- that&#39;s my<br/>\njob!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;ll send something!<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I have read<br/>\n&gt; Holt, and agree with most everything I have read.  He,too, was a teacher;<br/>\n&gt; however, I don&#39;t think he was a parent.  My point is that living with<br/>\n&gt; children 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, is different than being with them for<br/>\n&gt; prescribed hours each day.  When I taught, I was not a parent.  When I became<br/>\n&gt; a parent, my ideas about educ. did change radically.  I cannot fathom putting<br/>\n&gt; my kids in school, and I know homeschooling is definitely the best for<br/>\n&gt; children, but I, too, find what works for me- at least for now- is a blending<br/>\n&gt; of sorts.  I encourage  and offer ideas, and at times I fight the frustration<br/>\n&gt; of having ideas rejected, and the &quot;teacher&quot; in me wants to rear up and &quot;take<br/>\n&gt; charge&quot;.  This is why I am researching other ideas like  C Mason , and Samuel<br/>\n&gt; Blumenfeld.  I don&#39;t know how much of it I may use, but I am open to learning<br/>\n&gt; as much as I can about it all.  What each family ultimately feels most<br/>\n&gt; comfortable  with in the long run, is what will matter most, and that&#39;s what<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to keep in mind.<br/>\n&gt;             Karen--still learning all the time,too<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; LOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!
