That can go in the Thinking Physics questions.  (BTW,  I <br/>\ntried to order that book today but someone else must have in the same moment, <br/>\nbecause I got a refund notice from Amazon a few hours later.  I don&#39;t want a <br/>\nrefund, I want the book!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...   The tent across the meadow received (found the next day) a sticky <br/>\ntarget-tipped arrow.  Sticky and stuck in mountain dirt, so kind of <br/>\ndirt-encrusted, and sticky.   The marshmallow had landed, still flaming, right at our feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if there had been a little collar, like dogs wear after surgery, maybe <br/>\nthe marshmallow would&#39;ve stayed on!  But the arrow would&#39;ve been a bit impeded, <br/>\naerodynamically speaking, by a marshmallow-sized dog collar.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] toy guns/Nerf/ was getting there","postDate":"1096673169","msgId":100110,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2NjkwQTIzLTE0MDEtMTFEOS04NzE5LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZDUwMWM0YTc5MSQwYTlkNjQ0MCRiMjM3ZmVhOUBob21lMT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwZDUwMWM0YTc5MSQwYTlkNjQ0MCRiMjM3ZmVhOUBob21lMT4="},"prevInTopic":100074,"nextInTopic":100111,"prevInTime":100109,"nextInTime":100111,"topicId":100074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m going way back in a faint memory so forgive me if I butcher it.  I think it talks about &quot;awareness&quot; and the adrenaline rush and the &quot;Aha&quot; moment of getting &quot;shot&quot;.   The acceptance that you were &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;caught&quot; (per the rules) defined who you were. The &quot;playing fair&quot; was an important social issue.   Don&#39;t know if this makes sense, I am going try to hunt it down.  I thought it made a great point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother side question?  Does anyone know where all of the cool Nerf guns went?  We bought a few, 10 plus years ago.  DH had them at work and had cubicle wars occasionally (bunch of very nonviolent engineers : ).  They even initiated each new employee, including the new boss, with a surprise barrage of foam missiles.  Very cool group.  Anyway, he has changed jobs and brought them home, but we need more for all kids to share.  The ones I find out there now are so lame.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth in MD<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100186,"nextTopicId":100239}}
