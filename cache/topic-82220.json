Funny story (but be <br/>\nFOREWARNED, its kind of disgusting too).<br/>\n<br/>\nMany years ago, when my DD was about 2 years old (no more than 3), my dad had <br/>\na boil that got infected.  He went to the ER, but they sent him home.  A few <br/>\ndays later, things started getting worse; he had developed gang-green (SP?).  <br/>\nIt really smelled.  He was pretty much confined to his bedroom, but would have <br/>\nto occasionally go to the bathroom, spreading the smell throughout the house. <br/>\n IT WAS JUST GROSS!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the toothbrushes were in the bathroom, and I couldn&#39;t stand the <br/>\nthought of using them.  So I BOILED them to get them &quot;disinfected.&quot;  UMMM, this <br/>\nwasn&#39;t one of my brightest moments!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter had this purple tooth brush at the time that smelled like <br/>\n&quot;grape.&quot;  It was her all time favorite.  Well, to make a long story VERY SHORT, guess <br/>\nwho went shopping AT 1a for a purple toothbrush that smelled like &quot;grape&quot;?  <br/>\nALL OF THE BRISTLES IN ALL OF THE BRUSHES FELL OUT IN THE BOILING WATER.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO...MORAL OF THE STORY?  GO AND BUY A NEW TOOTH BRUSH!  DO NOT BOIL!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and BTW, after 2 surgeries, my dad is just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy <br/>\n(whose family STILL laughs at this one)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82296,"nextTopicId":82305}}
