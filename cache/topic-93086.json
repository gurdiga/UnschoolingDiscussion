This <br/>\nreminds me of a scene from a movie I&#39;ve been watching this week -<br/>\n 28 Days Later. In the movie, a killer virus wipes out most of the <br/>\npopulation of England, and one of the themes among the survivors is <br/>\nhow much they need each other. One of the survivors dreams that he <br/>\nwakes up and the other survivors have left him alone. You can see in <br/>\nhis panic just how much we need other humans for survival. Almost <br/>\nnone of us is truly &quot;independent&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my kids, I hope they achieve the level of independence that <br/>\nthey need at any given time, and that it&#39;s true independence and not <br/>\nreactionary independence.

At times, I lived on the street rather than ask them <br/>\nfor money or assistance. That&#39;s what I mean by reactionary <br/>\nindependence, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s healthy. It was more of <br/>\na &quot;I&#39;ll show them I don&#39;t need them&quot; kind of a thing. I&#39;d like to <br/>\nthink that if my kids every really *need* us, they&#39;ll come to us for <br/>\nhelp. And that when they don&#39;t need us, they&#39;ll be happy taking care <br/>\nof themselves at whatever age that is. I like that at the ages they <br/>\nare now, they&#39;re around us so much that they&#39;re learning many of the <br/>\nskills you really need to be independent (how to cook, shop, make <br/>\nphone calls, interact with people in the general public) just by <br/>\nbeing in the real world in the daytime instead of sequestered away in <br/>\nan artificial environment.

That qualification made, here&#39;s the thought: <br/>\n<br/>\nSince unschooled children are learning through day to day life, <br/>\nthere is so much more opportunity to gather the skills they need to <br/>\nlead a safe, rich, unsupervised life.  And it seems that many people <br/>\nwho would be unschoolers start with the attitude from a younger age <br/>\nof involving their children in their day-day lives in a way that not <br/>\nonly helps them form healthy attachments to people but also size up <br/>\nthe world -- not to say these are not skills other children can&#39;t <br/>\nand don&#39;t learn, only a particular tendency of unschooled children <br/>\nto be actively engrossed in the parents&#39; world rather than <br/>\nsegregated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think also when we are with our kids, learning as they do, we are <br/>\nso aware of what they do and don&#39;t know; what they have discovered <br/>\nvs. what they need to discover still -- it is easy to delegate <br/>\nresponsibility for many skills (let&#39;s say money sense as one <br/>\nexample) to a curriculum or public school teacher; parents assume <br/>\nthe necessary skills have been taught and yet often they haven&#39;t <br/>\nbeen.  A child in an unschooling home will likely have more exposure <br/>\nto these skills, and a parent can easily pick up on places the <br/>\nchild/young adult needs more experience to lead a <br/>\nsafe/content/independent life and fill in.  Also the child&#39;s been <br/>\nschooled in life rather than in a classroom, so of course more real-<br/>\nlife experience follows. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think this begins at a very young age on a philosophical level; <br/>\nalmost every person I know with 3-4 year olds feels compelled <br/>\nto &quot;teach&quot; them or send them to preschool; few trust life to provide <br/>\nenough learning opportunities.

Parents that are &quot;giddy&quot; <br/>\nfor themselves, and not remotely for their children. Sure, not <br/>\neveryone is cut out to be a full time/stay at home parent and those <br/>\nkids are probably better off in school--and i understand pam&#39;s desire <br/>\nthat this list not turn into a bash-fest against these other parents <br/>\nand remain a forum for unschooling. But there is a big difference in <br/>\na parent being supportive and encouraging independance when the <br/>\nchild/young adult is ready, and a parent kicking the child out the <br/>\ndoor at age 18 with a good riddance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"postDate":"1082764214","msgId":93086,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2Y2EzbStqMTVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93091,"prevInTime":93085,"nextInTime":93087,"topicId":93086,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It is a WONDERFUL time for them, why should they not be excited and giddy and why should we not share that with them?

Once that baby or toddler get to teen <br/>\nyears, you aren&#39;t parenting the same person. You&#39;ve already said <br/>\nmany sad goodbyes, and yet, there is such joy in the next stage. I <br/>\nwould no more want Trevor to be a toddler again, than I would want <br/>\nJalen to suddenly grow up. (well, maybe for a day or two:)<br/>\nEvery stage is so interesting, and our relationship evolves to new <br/>\nlevels. I LOVE watching Trevor try new things, philosophize about <br/>\ndeep matters and talk about his own place.<br/>\nHe&#39;s always been fiercely independent, and he already talks about <br/>\nhaving his own place. I lamented that maybe home wasn&#39;t so great if <br/>\nhe wanted his own place so badly, and he laughed and said &quot;that&#39;s <br/>\nnot it Mom, I don&#39;t want to move out yet, I&#39;m just looking forward <br/>\nto having things exactly how I want them without anyone messing with <br/>\nit&quot; (a problem with younger sibs).<br/>\nThat&#39;s cool.<br/>\nI&#39;ll be happy for him as he explores the world in new ways, <br/>\nincluding his own house or apartment.
