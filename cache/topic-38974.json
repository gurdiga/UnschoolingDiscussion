Unitarian<br/>\nUniversalists as a whole definitely don&#39;t because they aren&#39;t Christian. But<br/>\nthere *are* some Unitarian churches -- *just* Unitarian not Unitarian<br/>\nUniversalist -- that are independent of the Unitarian Universalist<br/>\nAssociation. Some, I think, are Christian but, since the Unitarians were a<br/>\nliberal church before 1961 when the UUA was formed, I suspect those that<br/>\nremained independent don&#39;t make an issue of the details that other<br/>\ndenominations go into. They&#39;d even be fine with members not seeing Jesus as<br/>\ndivine.<br/>\n<br/>\n(It *is* confusing because UU&#39;s often call themselves Unitarians :-/)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would you tell<br/>\n&gt; me what this means, and forgive me if what I guess is off base?

(It can make your head hurt when people try to explain it ;-) To<br/>\nme it doesn&#39;t sound that hard to grasp. Hindus manage gods with hundreds of<br/>\nsimultaneous aspects. So I feel like I must be missing something! ;-) Or it<br/>\nmight just be Western thought that has problems grasping things that don&#39;t<br/>\nfall into nice neat this or that categories and doesn&#39;t want to wrap around<br/>\nthe idea that things might be more than one thing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt says in the Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to the Bible that the Westminster<br/>\nShorter Catechism explains it as &quot;There are three persons in the Godhead,<br/>\nthe Father, The Son, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one God, the<br/>\nsame in substance, equal in power and glory.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(There&#39;s also a Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to World Religions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a number of definitions of who is a Christian at the Religious<br/>\nTolerance site I mentioned before. Some are definitions given by particular<br/>\ndenominations, some by scholars. So there&#39;s a wide range.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_defn.htm\">http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_defn.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(The Religious Tolerance site covers just about all religions so is a good<br/>\nplace to dip your toe in about other religions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently some people who *self-identify* as Christians view Jesus as not<br/>\ndivine but as a great moral teacher. The fundamentalist churches are pretty<br/>\nexplicit about what is and isn&#39;t truth and therefore what must be believed.<br/>\n(*No* question about Jesus being God.) As you go across the spectrum of<br/>\ndenominations towards the liberal end, the list of what is truth diminishes<br/>\nand what is left up to the individual grows.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing God and all -- to most Christians -- whether God was speaking through<br/>\nJesus and therefore a prophet, is rather unimportant ;-) But I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nhistorically or during Jesus&#39;s time there was a progression. Was he seen<br/>\nfirst as a prophet and then as the Messiah. Did Jesus speak of himself that<br/>\nway, first as a prophet then as God? I&#39;m sure someone here knows! Well,<br/>\nknows in a scholarly sense of what is believed since the New Testament was<br/>\nwritten well after the events.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I believe the Muslims view Jesus as a prophet (along with Abraham and<br/>\nMoses and others, including Mohammed.) (If you type Jesus and prophet into<br/>\nGoogle, the websites on the first page are almost entirely Islamic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard of Jesus being considered divine but not part<br/>\nof God. That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t anyone just that it isn&#39;t a popular<br/>\nenough belief for me to have heard of it ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":257127,"authorName":"Deb","from":"Deb &lt;herbtea@...&gt;","profile":"live_oak2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Religion question","postDate":"1025798919","msgId":38974,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEMjQ3MzA3LkFCRTEwNzUyQGd0ZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjU3ODU0NDYuNDAzLjcxMTY4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38977,"prevInTime":38973,"nextInTime":38975,"topicId":38974,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oooh, this is interesting!
