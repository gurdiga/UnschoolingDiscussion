She moved to New Mexico from <br/>\nVirginia and hooked up with a temp agency.  She did a variety of jobs <br/>\nand made enough money to support herself while she tried to figure <br/>\nout what she wanted.  One of the temp jobs led her to the right path <br/>\nand she went back to school 3 years after she dropped out.  She is <br/>\nnow in acupuncture school and loving it.  She says dropping out of <br/>\nschool was the best thing she ever did.
