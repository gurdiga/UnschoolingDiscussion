I had been in Kirby&#39;s room playing the <br/>\nnew game on Neopets (Destruct-O-Match II, a Tetrisish kind of thing) and had the <br/>\nTV on PBS just to see what they had on Sundays.  Something on garage sales <br/>\nand thrift stores, and tracking some of the items to their inventors (with video <br/>\ninterviews and tie-ins, VERY cool).    Then the video game thing came on and <br/>\nI was stuck to it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith came home from being out and about, and the pot of chicken curry I had <br/>\nput on was done, but I could not leave the TV.

They do consider<br/>\nthat there is a disease of addiction, particularly because experientially<br/>\nwhen someone is addicted to one thing (the &quot;drug of choice&quot;) and begins to<br/>\nwork a program of recovery, often the addictive behavior or obsessive<br/>\nfeelings crop up somewhere else or are recognized as being part of other<br/>\nareas of the addict&#39;s life (like shopping compulsively) or with some other<br/>\ntype of substance (food is big substitute substance). It is probably not a<br/>\ndisease in the medical sense that there is some germ or organism necessarily<br/>\ncausing an immune response, or however a doctor might define the word<br/>\n&quot;disease&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this naming issue is a bit like the word &quot;Unschooling&quot;. We who are<br/>\ndoing it fully - whole life Radical Unschooling - have a definition and<br/>\nusage of the word that is different from other people who (somewhat<br/>\nannoyingly to me) consider themselves &quot;unschooling, except for math&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;unschooling with unit studies&quot;. The addicts seeking recovery are the ones<br/>\nwho are using the phrase &quot;disease of addiction&quot; because it seems to help<br/>\nrecovery, even if outside of that community the phrase seems wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main point I was trying to make earlier is that sometimes past<br/>\nexperiences with addiction color our perceptions, have us making negative<br/>\nassumptions, and influence our word usage in ways that can increase fear and<br/>\ndecrease our ability to just observe our children. I don&#39;t think that being<br/>\nafraid of electronic media is helpful for Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

If one of my <br/>\nnormally high-energy, active, productive teenage daughters began, for <br/>\nno apparent reason,  to spend most of her days lying on the couch <br/>\nwatching daytime tv like Oprah, soap operas, Jerry Springer, and <br/>\ninfomercials, that would indicate that something was going on with her <br/>\nthat almost certainly wasn&#39;t healthy. I&#39;d suspect depression and be <br/>\nworried about her.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I don&#39;t worry at all when they have periods of time <br/>\nof watching an unusual amount of tv - usually, but not always, it is <br/>\napparent to me that they are TIRED and this is recuperation time from a <br/>\nperiod of intense activity. Or there is emotional stuff going on in <br/>\ntheir lives (boyfriend breakups, etc.) and they are utilizing this time <br/>\nto keep one part of their brain occupied while other parts are <br/>\nprocessing the issues. Occasionally it means they are coming down with <br/>\na cold or something. Once in a while it has meant, for Roya, that she <br/>\nwas procrastinating on doing something she felt she should do, but <br/>\ndreaded. Sometimes I can say, &quot;So, what is up?&quot; and that&#39;ll initiate a <br/>\nstream of information and deep discussion. Other times, the kid&#39;ll say, <br/>\n&quot;Nothing, just tired.&quot; So be it. I keep an eye on them - usually spend <br/>\ntime watching with them (which I don&#39;t usually do, by the way).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you just tell them, &quot;Turn off the tv - two hours a day is enough for <br/>\nyou,&quot; then you could be treating a symptom and masking a problem.
