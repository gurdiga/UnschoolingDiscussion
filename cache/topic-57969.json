None of it really matters, but I do know just from seeing <br/>\n&gt; mine our first year homeschooling that they really do retain more when they <br/>\n&gt; are seeking the knowledge.  <br/>\n&gt; I honestly do worry about writing because my son&#39;s writing skills aren&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; very good compared to &quot;grade expectations&quot;.

His boy scout club is with the ps kids. <br/>\nHe&#39;s the only homeschooler there but they treat him great. One time they <br/>\nasked a question and all the other kids knew the answer except Christopher. <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t mind but his Dad did a little. I reminded his Dad of all the things <br/>\nChristopher know that they don&#39;t and may never if it&#39;s not a part of school. <br/>\nChristopher hates to write too! If use to get to me but since we started <br/>\nunschooling I just let it go. I look at his Dad&#39;s handwriting and my brother <br/>\nand even mine at time and ours isn&#39;t any better so I figured when he wants it <br/>\nto look better he&#39;ll do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nLori in MI<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57834,"nextTopicId":57970}}
