Communities are such a vital part of life and it&#39;s sad<br/>\nthat most neighborhoods are no longer really communities. We had the same<br/>\nideas as you all, we were living in NW Washington and we visited some of the<br/>\ncommunities there. If you can, Sharingwood is a great community to visit,<br/>\njust Northeast of Seattle. I think they have a website up somewhere. We<br/>\nwanted to start a community, out in Central Oregon, but found the task too<br/>\ndaunting and figured out that by the time we really got it off the ground,<br/>\nour kids would be older than we wanted them to be. Instead, we ended up<br/>\nmoving here to Eugene and we live right next to an intentional neighborhood<br/>\ncommunity which we will hopefully join at some point (they are growing). Our<br/>\nwhole neighborhood is so community-oriented, it is great. We know all our<br/>\nneighbors and do many things with them, we&#39;ve had holiday parties and<br/>\ncanning get-togethers and we get gardening advice and so much more.<br/>\nCommunity definitely makes a big difference in how our lives go on a daily<br/>\nbasis. The one thing I like about where we are now is that we have community<br/>\nand we&#39;re also right in town, so we can bicycle anywhere and have all the<br/>\nadvantages of being in town. Anyways, if you&#39;re interested in visiting our<br/>\nneighborhood and the community that is down the street, let me know! It&#39;s a<br/>\nbit unique, because instead of going rural to form their community, these<br/>\npeople all bought lots in a subdivision and built their own houses around a<br/>\ncul-de-sac in town. But the houses are not your typical suburban houses, the<br/>\nre&#39;s a strawbale house and some made out of rast-crete (sp?) and other<br/>\nalternative building materials.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I was going to grow up to be a<br/>\nweirdo&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy swim!&quot; at the aquarium, her favorite place<br/>\nin the world<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3y7XiaTdrekEEbv4lLKtz_I3OZsIyxCIzRJPKQw6cMDFt12hjrjetJGtMns2TZdj-qlp_7BmpcfH9mpse4GmaNbpmdwTga8ReRBPYe5GxoYiOM3w1Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intentional Community (WA)","postDate":"985472214","msgId":17220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBQkQxQ0Q2LjIxNDkyLjEwNkFEQjVAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5ZGpkdCtxZGs5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17169,"nextInTopic":17238,"prevInTime":17219,"nextInTime":17221,"topicId":17169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For anyone interested, we are investigating the possibility of \u000f Cohousing, or a similar such ecovilliage community, in NW Washington \u000f most likely.\u000e Nanci,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1837272471\">For anyone interested, we are investigating the <br/>\npossibility of \u000f<br/>\nCohousing, or a similar such ecovilliage community, in <br/>\nNW Washington \u000f<br/>\nmost likely.\u000e<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci, wow, I am so jealous!
