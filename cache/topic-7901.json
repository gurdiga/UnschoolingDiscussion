Rather than send messages through <br/>\nemail, and wait for the person to respond, this chat program allows <br/>\nfor real time chat.  I see what you type the minute you press enter, <br/>\nand vice versa.  You can &quot;talk&quot; to people from all around the world.  <br/>\nBecause of the time differences, and everyone&#39;s different sleep <br/>\npatterns, you could literally stay connected 24/7, and always find <br/>\nsomeone to talk to.  Some of the kids channels can be pretty <br/>\nvulgar.  Some of the older kids get on the channels, and like to <br/>\npractice their &quot;lovely&quot; new vocabulary, away from mom and dad&#39;s <br/>\nears.  They also like to &quot;teach&quot; some of the younger kids things <br/>\nwhich would shock you and I.<br/>\nI have set up a channel, which will be secret.  Only those people <br/>\nwho are aware of this channel, (the unschooler&#39;s list) will have <br/>\naccess to the channel.  It will not be listed for everyone to see.  <br/>\nYou will also need a password to enter the channel.  <br/>\nInitially I would suggest monitoring your child, until we are sure the <br/>\nchannel takes off in the direction we would like.  Anyone using <br/>\ninappropriate language, and/or vulgarity, will be banned <br/>\nimmediately, meaning, they will no longer have access to the <br/>\nchannel. <br/>\nOnce again, the download site is:   www.mirc.co.uk<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot to keep my post with all of the information on it.  If someone <br/>\ncould repost it, either to the list, or to me, I would appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen<br/>\n<br/>\nDitto for me.  I confess, I&#39;m not very web-literate.
