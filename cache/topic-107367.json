My <br/>\nquestion is:  what if there is an emergency?  Once, school was <br/>\nclosed early because of ice and snow and Noelle made her way home <br/>\nand didn&#39;t call anyone (or maybe they wouldn&#39;t take her calls?!) and <br/>\nher parents were surprised to find her at home alone when they got <br/>\nthere.
