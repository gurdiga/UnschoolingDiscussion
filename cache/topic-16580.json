I co-habitated with my British boyfriend for awhile<br/>\n(many years ago), and I remember the first time I stepped onto his scale,<br/>\nlooked down and thought. &quot;OK, I&#39;m 10, but 10 what??? A perfect 10?&quot;  :-). I<br/>\nhad no idea what stone was. For those who don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s about 14<br/>\npounds per stone, right??<br/>\nAFA the weight goes, I hear you! I gained over 60 pounds with each pregnancy<br/>\n(despite daily exercise and a good diet) so each time it has been a long,<br/>\nhard effort to take it all back off. Again, I try to break it down into<br/>\nlittle goals. One thing that worked well for me was that I would try to eat<br/>\nhealthy, be very active on a daily basis, and get regular exercise but I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t really focus on &quot;dieting&quot;, except for one week a month I would have<br/>\na &quot;get tough&quot; week, where I would really crack down on what I was eating,<br/>\nand be very intense about exercise. I usually lost about 1.5 pounds that<br/>\nweek and 1 - 1.5 pounds the rest of the month, so I lost about 3 pounds a<br/>\nmonth total but 75% of the time I didn&#39;t feel deprived :-).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So I can set goals within goals - but loosing weight isnt the only<br/>\n&gt; gaol - or change.  How does a rather shy reserved person become more<br/>\n&gt; out going!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, brainstorming here. How about going to certain activities - like a book<br/>\ndiscussion group or a knitter&#39;s guild or something that interests you? Have<br/>\nyou heard of &quot;Toastmasters&quot;?? Here in the US (at least), it&#39;s a group that<br/>\nhelps reserved people learn to be more outgoing and get public speaking<br/>\npractice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;AND how does one become a country girl again, when one<br/>\n&gt; lives in town - and is likely to do so for a long time yet!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess that depends on whether or not there&#39;s anything rural near to you.<br/>\nCan you take horseback riding lessons at an arena? Or take a bicycle out on<br/>\nweekends and toodle through the countryside? Go on a hike? Start a small<br/>\nvegetable garden (you can even do it in containers on a patio)? Take a<br/>\nweekly walk through a botanical gardens?  Here in the U.S. we have something<br/>\ncalled &quot;4H&quot; where kids (and adults) can get involved in raising animals or<br/>\ndoing craftwork and then display their work at a yearly fair that takes<br/>\nplace in the summer. Rural kids/adults often do things like raising dairy<br/>\ncattle or goats, but urban kids/adults can participate by raising things<br/>\nlike Guinea Pigs (Cavies), rabbits, birds, etc. or doing quilting, canning,<br/>\nbaking, or other crafts. Is there a group like this where you live? Or some<br/>\nsort of &quot;country fair&quot; you could participate in?

Goals need to be concrete things, that are<br/>\nmeasurable. If you set a goal like &quot;eat healthier&quot;, it&#39;s really hard to know<br/>\nif you&#39;re doing it, to know when you&#39;ve achieved your goal. A more<br/>\nconcrete goal would be &quot;Eat 5 fruits and vegetables a day&quot;. That&#39;s something<br/>\nyou can track in a notebook. Or &quot;Don&#39;t add any sugar to my tea, coffee, or<br/>\nbreakfast cereal&quot; or &quot;Substitute whole-grains for white flour in all my<br/>\ncooking&quot;. If you break your goal of eating healthier into mini-goals like<br/>\nthis, and tackle one of them every 4 - 6 weeks (the amount of time it<br/>\ngenerally takes to change a habit), you will slowly and surely improve your<br/>\neating habits over the course of several months. This is the same for any<br/>\nnebulous over-all goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly you can answer the question of why you want to change, what, and how<br/>\nmuch. If you can think of concrete things you want to be able to do, you can<br/>\ntailor your goals towards accomplishing them. A health/fitness goal might be<br/>\nto hike up to a local mountain or butte, or to do a 5k run, or to walk to<br/>\nand from the grocery store every shopping day. Or it might be something<br/>\nbigger and longer term like a walking trip of Europe or a major mountain<br/>\nclimb. I remember going through a goal-setting course a few years ago (back<br/>\nwhen I was gainfully employed, and my employer paid for it), and I thought<br/>\n&quot;what a bunch of hocus-pocus&quot;. But now that I&#39;m older, and my time is more<br/>\nlimited (so that I do need to decide which things I want to focus on in my<br/>\ntime), I&#39;ve found that having concrete goals out in front of me is very<br/>\nhelpful towards prioritizing my daily schedules, and changing my daily<br/>\nplans and habits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have specific health/fitness/weight questions, about how to change,<br/>\netc. I&#39;d be glad to help answer any I can. Both my husband and I have been<br/>\ntrainers/coaches and competitive athletes. I spent the majority of my life<br/>\nbeing overweight, out of shape, eating terribly and feeling worse. I was<br/>\ntold I was &quot;unathletic&quot; and &quot;uncoordinated&quot;. Then I met a really great coach<br/>\nwho changed my life. Since then, this &quot;unathletic&quot; and &quot;uncoordinated&quot; woman<br/>\nhas competed at a university and national level in several sports. I<br/>\nstrongly believe in the power of the human to change, grow, and overcome<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;This is a great life!&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) Who walks backwards<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"April Spitzer","from":"&quot;April Spitzer&quot; &lt;aprilspit@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"IgEqUYotvDnh5-Ams20UKGK4C2I1EkyZ5u8Aq0SBuWgzAAyfmhwXyhldBYKO2ul_BsBORbhd6AF62PzlzWnYENLLruDG_UPDiz31x27U","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Is it menapause!!","postDate":"982585235","msgId":16590,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyNjdSQzFzWlY0Q2xsUEY2cDAwMDAxMDkwYUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16582,"nextInTopic":16628,"prevInTime":16589,"nextInTime":16591,"topicId":16580,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Marianne, when I want to change something, I decide what it is and then get the books about it and read read read..
