I <br/>\nstill have a great deal of bitterness about the cruelty that my son was <br/>\nsubjected to. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince you are a school teacher, and I have your ear, I&#39;d like to tell you <br/>\nsome of what I think might help the situation in schools today. First problem <br/>\nI believe is that we seem to be living in a time when it is somehow <br/>\npolitically not correct to place blame. If you look into the reality of <br/>\nbullying, it is quite different from a typical squabble between playmates. A <br/>\nsquabble generally erupts because of a temporary misunderstanding between a <br/>\ncouple of friends. If the adult intervenes, mediates and helps the children <br/>\nto figure out where they went wrong, the problem is usually quickly resolved <br/>\nand everyone resumes playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of bullying, you have usually a child with poor social skills and <br/>\nusually &quot;different&quot; in some way. The difference in my son&#39;s case is that he <br/>\nis more advanced intellectually than his age mates, and behind in emotional <br/>\nmaturity, and thinks way outside of the box. Everything he says is considered <br/>\nweird and therefore held in contempt. The &quot;difference&quot; can be just about <br/>\nanything though--race, religion, clothing, culture, body size, you name it. <br/>\nThe bully on the other hand is usually someone who may at first feel inferior <br/>\nfor whatever reason. He/She  needs to find someone even lower in the pecking <br/>\norder so that he/she can think &quot;Well I may be a loser, but at least I&#39;m not <br/>\nWeird, black, Hindu, unfashionable, listen to stupid music, fat/puny, you <br/>\nname it and therefore I am one step up from the bottom of the heap&quot; &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nbetter.&quot; Pretty soon the bully realizes that picking on the &quot;different&quot; one, <br/>\nis not only useful as a tool for self social promotion but it gives one a <br/>\nheady feeling of POWER! We all know how addictive power is. The bully has now <br/>\nmade the mental transition from &quot;I&#39;m inferior&quot; to &quot;I&#39;m superior.&quot; We are now <br/>\nfar from the realm of misunderstandings where a little heart to heart and <br/>\nplay session will solve anything. Unfortunately the adults who could actually <br/>\nintervene and put a stop to all of this are frequently clueless as to what is <br/>\nreally going on because they either believe that all youthful disagreements <br/>\nare innocent misunderstandings, are not paying attention to the situation <br/>\nand/or don&#39;t give a damn. Kids really can be extremely mean, just because <br/>\nthey derive pleasure from feeling superior. This is bad and evil behavior, <br/>\nand should be called such, at whatever age. You need to truly identify a <br/>\nproblem before you can deal with it. Sadistic adults, thugs, wife beaters, <br/>\nand unethical CEOs don&#39;t just appear out of nowhere. They are raised and <br/>\ngroomed by well meaning clueless or careless adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to deal with all of this... First, adults must have many many discussions <br/>\nabout the fact that just because the majority thinks or acts a certain way, <br/>\ndoes not mean they are somehow superior, or correct. A great method in <br/>\nschools would be regular circle discussions involving all of the kids.( <br/>\nBullying usually occurs in front of an audience of other kids, and frequently <br/>\nas a way to impress them) led by an adult who knows the score and who <br/>\nintroduces provocative subjects such as &quot;What would you say or do if you saw <br/>\na kid kick another kid? What if the kid who had been kicked was somebody who <br/>\nis considered a nerd? What if the nerd had said something nasty or stupid, <br/>\nwould he deserve it then? Why do you think the nerd might have said something <br/>\nnasty? Do you think it might have been because he might have seen the other <br/>\nkid mimicking him?&quot;  Other examples of subjects could cover basic right vs. <br/>\nwrong issues such as &quot;If someone took $20.00 out of someone&#39;s backpack, would <br/>\nyou consider that stealing? If someone took a pencil out of someone&#39;s <br/>\nbackpack, would that be considered stealing?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, adults have to actually pay attention. Lastly, once there is a general <br/>\nconsensus about what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is <br/>\nbad, then there must be some reliable rewards and punishments/consequences. <br/>\nMost people in power unfortunately will never relinquish power unless forced, <br/>\n even though they may know that they are abusing that power. A bully must be <br/>\nput into a position where he/she only stands to lose when they bully. That is <br/>\nthe way to get them off of their power trip. The other kids and adults are <br/>\nreally critical, because they can boo, applaud or silently give their consent <br/>\nto the bully. They can&#39;t boo the bad behavior and have a positive influence <br/>\nif they can&#39;t see bad and evil behavior for what it really is. Evil requires <br/>\nan atmosphere of ignorance and apathy to flourish. <br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] teachers like me?","postDate":"1025461260","msgId":38805,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhYy40NmEzOGI2LjJhNTBhNjBjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38800,"nextInTopic":38831,"prevInTime":38804,"nextInTime":38806,"topicId":38800,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/30/02 12:27:51 PM Central Daylight Time, Bj4kids@aol.com ...
