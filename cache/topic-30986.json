I<br/>\n&gt; tried to talk with my ex about taking my older boy out.  He didn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; want to discuss it.  I finally decided that Noah&#39;s sanity was the most<br/>\n&gt; important thing and took him out.  The ex put up with it for a year and a<br/>\n&gt; half and then announced that we were going to court if I didn&#39;t put him<br/>\n&gt; back in school.  Being 8 months pregnant at the time, I didn&#39;t want a<br/>\ncourt<br/>\n&gt; fight.  Neither did Noah, so he went to school.  Worst thing that ever<br/>\n&gt; happened to him, and his father even agrees......now.  What I&#39;m trying to<br/>\n&gt; say is that waiting until the divorce is final does not guarantee that he<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t fight homeschooling.  I&#39;m inclined to say that stability for the<br/>\n&gt; children would be the thing to argue for.  They&#39;re going to be going<br/>\n&gt; through a lot of changes because of the divorce.
