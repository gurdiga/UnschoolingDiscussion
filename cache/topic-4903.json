I tried to find a more appropriate address to send my comments regarding an article by Tom Danehy in the Tucson","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-225956977\">Copy of my letter re: Tom Danehy article.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to find a more appropriate address to send my comments regarding<br/>\nan article by Tom Danehy in the Tucson Weekly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article, &quot;Poor Sports&quot; was filled with many highly charged negative<br/>\nreferences to homeschooling. Having failed to find an address for<br/>\n&quot;letters to the editor&quot; I thought I would pass my comments on to you<br/>\nwith the hope that you would know to whom they should be forwarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose controversy is a sign of success, but be that as it may, I<br/>\nthink some corrective information would be useful to provide a more<br/>\nbalanced view.<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Danehy makes many generalizations about who would homeschool and the<br/>\n(from his point of view) nefarious motivations that drive such<br/>\nfamilies.  Mostly he seems to be concerned about narrow mindedness and<br/>\nbigotry being the driving forces behind homeschooling.  This ironic<br/>\nobservation would seem to be a case of projection on the part of Mr.<br/>\nDanehy or perhaps simple ignorance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homeschooling &quot;movement&quot; such as it is contains a wide spectrum of<br/>\nindividuals with an equally wide spectrum of views.  Yes there are<br/>\npeople who choose to homeschool because they are threatened by diversity<br/>\nand seek to preserve their own insular world view for themselves and<br/>\ntheir children.  I personally think that they are entitled to their view<br/>\nand so long as they don&#39;t make me and mine conform to it they are<br/>\nwelcome to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever Mr. Danehy&#39;s ignorance of the homeschooling/ unschooling<br/>\nmovement are revealed by his focus on what I believe is the minority<br/>\n(though a significant one) of homeschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that he visit<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm\">http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nwhich is a preeminent site for the growing without schools point of<br/>\nview.  It is sponsored by a foundation established by John Holt who was<br/>\nprobably the leading critic of the educational system of the last fifty<br/>\nyears.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe community of homeschoolers with whom my family associates is<br/>\nmotivated by a dislike of the bland, superficial, prejudiced,<br/>\nauthoritarian, consumerist orientation of schools everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also suggest a small collection of essays &quot;Deschooling Our<br/>\nLives&quot; edited by Matt Hern, &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; by Ivan Illich and any<br/>\nof the many books by John Holt as an antidote to the profound ignorance<br/>\ndisplayed by Mr. Danehy&#39;s shallow, thoughtless and bigoted remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your attention to this.  I hope you are able to fwd my<br/>\ncomments to either &quot;letters to the editor&quot; or a similar appropriate<br/>\naddress.<br/>\n--<br/>\nbest wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a wonderful gift possibility and to support a great cause check out:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html\">http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.
