I&#39;ve read through 5 digests now, and only caught bits and pieces of<br/>\nthe puppy conversation. Has anyone suggested the best way to find them GOOD<br/>\nhomes and I&#39;ve maybe missed it? We have a stray and her 9 pups that will be<br/>\nready for homes next week, and I&#39;m undecided about whether to just take them<br/>\nto the flea market and give them to whoever will take them or to take them<br/>\nto the rescue shelter. We&#39;ve also got a stray cat that just had 3 kittens<br/>\ntwo weeks ago under the house, so we&#39;ll have to do something with them too<br/>\nin about a month. I don&#39;t have the money to run an ad or to keep any of them<br/>\n much as I&#39;d love to. Three dogs, four cats, and a horse is our limit, I&#39;m<br/>\nafraid. These have got to go. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMyranda\r<br/>\nMommy to Brett (7.5), Tyler (6), and Cassidy (16 mths)\r<br/>\nAIM myrandamomof3<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74223,"nextTopicId":73914}}
