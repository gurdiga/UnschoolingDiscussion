(Likely applies to half<br/>\nworld pop.)<br/>\nb. In 37% of Americans,the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often<br/>\nmistaken for hunger.<br/>\nc. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one&#39;s metabolism as much as 3%.<br/>\nd. One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of<br/>\nthe dieters studied in a U-Washington study.<br/>\ne. Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.<br/>\nf. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could<br/>\nsignificantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.<br/>\ng. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory,<br/>\ntrouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or<br/>\non a printed page.<br/>\nh. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by<br/>\n45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less<br/>\nlikely to<br/>\ndevelop bladder cancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you drinking the amount of water you should every day?<br/>\n<br/>\nCOKE<br/>\nNo wonder coke tastes soooo good:<br/>\n1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of<br/>\nCoke in the trunk  to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.<br/>\n2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two<br/>\ndays.<br/>\n3. To clean a toilet:  Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl<br/>\nand.......Let the &quot;real thing&quot; sit for one hour, then flush clean. The<br/>\ncitric acid in Coke removes<br/>\nstains from vitreous china.<br/>\n4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a<br/>\ncrumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.<br/>\n5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola<br/>\nover the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.<br/>\n6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the<br/>\nrusted bolt for several minutes.<br/>\n7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap<br/>\nthe ham in aluminum foil, and bake.
