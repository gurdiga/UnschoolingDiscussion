Put the rest of the cards in the <br/>\nmiddle as a draw and discard pile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe object of the game is to replace the face down cards with the correct number card to <br/>\ngo in order from one to ten. Kings are wild cards and can be used for any number. Jacks <br/>\nand Queens are worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst player either uses the discard or draws a new card. Look at your face down cards and <br/>\nreplace the correct one with the drawn card (if it will work). For instance, if player A draws <br/>\na six, she would replace the first card int he second row with the six. Flip the card over <br/>\nthat is in the six spot and see if it can replace another card in the two rows. If it&#39;s, say, a <br/>\nfour, then put it in the four position and turn over the card that is there. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s a <br/>\nKing. Place it anywhere there is a face down card. Flip that card and look to see if it can <br/>\nreplace another card and so on until you turn up a card that can&#39;t be used (either the slot <br/>\nis already full or it&#39;s a Jack or Queen). Discard the card that won&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Caveat: If the king is placed in a slot that has a card that can be put where the king is, <br/>\nlucky you! You can now move the king to yet another spot until that card is replaced by it&#39;s <br/>\ncorrect number. It is possible to fill up the number rows with up to all four kings-there is <br/>\nno need to replace them, but if you can, go ahead.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the next player takes her turn. She can either use the discard or draw a new card. She <br/>\ndoes the same thing - checks to see if the card will work in her two rows and flips up and <br/>\nreplaces cards until she can&#39;t go any further.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst player to replace all her cards with the correct numbers and/or kings, goes out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGather up all the cards and shuffle. Deal them out again only this time, the player who <br/>\n&quot;went out&quot; first gets nine cards while the other player gets ten. This time the player with <br/>\nnine cards won&#39;t be able to use tens at all, but she&#39;ll have fewer cards to replace.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay continues like this until one player has gone from ten cards, to nine to eight to seven <br/>\nall the way down to one card (which only need be replaced by a King or an ace). <br/>\n<br/>\nA player wins when she goes out with only one card before the other player (no matter <br/>\nhow many cards that player has left).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that&#39;s clear enough! My kids love this game and it&#39;s been a wonderful help with <br/>\ncounting and numeric order. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135843572,"authorName":"learn2day2002","from":"&quot;learn2day2002&quot; &lt;24hrmom@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Concentration","postDate":"1080243486","msgId":92252,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMzdmNldStmMTlpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMzdXMyMCszOG81QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":92249,"nextInTopic":92256,"prevInTime":92251,"nextInTime":92253,"topicId":92245,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I sent this a couple hours ago and it didn t seem to go through.

She has not really grasped the relationship of numbers to items and this was a <br/>\nbreakthrough of her own making. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also play &quot;I doubt it&quot; which has taught the subtlety of strategy and organization of <br/>\ncards into &quot;sets.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t set out to &quot;teach&quot; anything, and there is no lesson going on.
