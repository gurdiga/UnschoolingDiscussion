There&#39;s only 3 chairs left in this house -<br/>\ndh has one, the cat (very stressed) has the second, so I just have to<br/>\nsit on the computer chair!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been homeschooling my kids nearly all there lives. No 1 went to<br/>\nschool for 7 weeks, no. 4 went for 5 weeks. No 1 is now 18, has recently<br/>\nleft home and is working for a beekeeper.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have just sold our house to another homeschooling family, with 8<br/>\nchildren, who we didn&#39;t know till they came to look at the house. We are<br/>\nplanning to buy a little land in the country and build, but in the<br/>\nmeantime are renting a house 1/2 an hour from town to see how we like<br/>\nit!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always liked the ideas of unschooling, but am not always as<br/>\ntrusting as I could be - kids with some learning difficulties in &#39;basic&#39;<br/>\nareas such as reading and writing test one&#39;s philosophical outlook<br/>\nsomewhat. Still, I think I&#39;m far too lazy to spend too much time being<br/>\nstructured and organised and trying to manipulate unwilling people so we<br/>\ndo tend to be pretty much unschoolers, in spite of my internal battles!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63,"nextTopicId":43}}
