What I saw and still see<br/>\nis someone saying that &quot;most&quot; people who say their kids have allergies<br/>\nare either delusional or using it as a control issue.  I believe the<br/>\nexact phrase was something about the minute number of people with deadly<br/>\nallergies.  Granted there aren&#39;t oodles of people out there with life<br/>\nthreatening allergies.  There are, however, oodles more with non-life<br/>\nthreatening allergies.  Lynda discussed the differences in medical<br/>\nterminology.  Whether you call it an allergy or a sensitivity there are<br/>\nthousands of people out there with these problems.  They are often<br/>\nmisdiagnosed and put on medications they don&#39;t need.  They are often<br/>\nconvince sugar in general is the problem when it is really dyes or corn<br/>\nor wheat or milk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot one of the people who has stated here that his/her child has<br/>\nallergies has said that those experiencing no problems should limit their<br/>\nchildren&#39;s diets.  They have instead said, &quot;if you see these kinds of<br/>\nsymptoms, you might want to consider looking into the allergy<br/>\nconnection.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned long ago that those who do not recognize that my children have<br/>\nallergies should not be allowed in any way shape or form to  influence my<br/>\ndecisions about food for my family.  One of the biggest problems I<br/>\npersonally face is that it is darn near impossible to feed us all without<br/>\nhaving something someone is allergic to in the house.  And I&#39;m not sure<br/>\njust not buying it is a great way to handle it either.  They need to<br/>\nlearn to monitor themselves and if it is never in the house they may not<br/>\nlearn how.  I guess it is sort of like the soda pop thing someone here<br/>\nwas discussing.  For a long time, I kept most corn products out of the<br/>\nhouse because both Rachel and I are allergic.  I found that she would<br/>\nbinge on it at her friend&#39;s house and then come home with a miserable<br/>\nmigraine-like headache.  So, we decided to keep it in the house and just<br/>\nremind her every time she got headaches why she had them.  She learned to<br/>\ncontrol it.  Obviously that does not work if you have life-threatening<br/>\nallergies though!<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n                                                     - Robert Frost</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bridget","from":"&quot;Bridget&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"n9BOFhJnu98c-gDUrQNyOaPsXzqqazBwT3D5q4rSnddzu4Ud-WYdQMujK3YlbOp5ZTozV79gw_sLq5pM-GK_StBGcCtuNGkSjWSf","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Allergies","postDate":"1005922157","msgId":27789,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl0MzkxZCsyOGJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0LjE2NTE5NjhhLjI5MjUyMmM2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27755,"nextInTopic":27953,"prevInTime":27788,"nextInTime":27790,"topicId":1944,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... mouths.

For a month I wrote down every<br/>\nsingle thing that went in my mouth.  I also wrote down every symptom and<br/>\nwhen it occured.  My Doctor reviewed it and picked out the correlation<br/>\nbetween corn and my headaches immediately.  I then did an elimination and<br/>\ntest thing.  For four or five days I ate no corn at all.  Then I ate pure<br/>\ncorn (mush if I recall) and he tested my bp, pulse, etc. for changes.  Of<br/>\ncourse, I promptly had a killer headache too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the kids the discoveries were more difficult.  I am not disiplined<br/>\nenough to put them through an elimination diet.  We found Rachel&#39;s corn<br/>\nallergy because he symptoms were so much like mine we decided to test<br/>\nthat one first with her.  Jenni&#39;s milk problem (and it is beyond just<br/>\nlactose intolerance) we found by accident when she was three and a half. <br/>\nWe ran out of milk one day and I didn&#39;t go get any for two days.  Her<br/>\nsymptoms cleared up but I didn&#39;t make the connection until I ran out of<br/>\nmilk a second time!<br/>\n<br/>\nWyndham is the difficult one.  I figured out the dye allergy in a very<br/>\nnovel way.  He kept throwing up a lot.  It was always bright yellow. <br/>\nAfter about a dozen cases of vividly bright yellow vomit, I made the<br/>\nconnection.  He developed dye allergies one color at a time.  Wheat was<br/>\nanother trial and error thing.  We tested milk first with him because the<br/>\nsymptoms were bowel related.  It wasn&#39;t that so I went looking for other<br/>\nallergies that tended to present with bowel symptoms first and decided to<br/>\ntry wheat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often run into people who think I am exaggerating (or making up) my<br/>\nkids allergies.  Then they happen to be around for a Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde<br/>\nand they usually are turned into true believers on the spot.  With<br/>\nWyndham especially, they difference is astounding.  You will see a nice<br/>\ntalkative but calm and intelligent little boy suddenly turn into a boy<br/>\nshaped pingpong ball bouncing off the walls and acting very peculiar.  I<br/>\nam alway the first to know he had something but my mother is now running<br/>\na close second.  We can both hear a change in the pitch of his voice that<br/>\nprecedes the outbursts by about 20 minutes or so.  If we can get<br/>\nanti-histamines in him in that window, we can keep him from going<br/>\ncompletely over the edge.  Our biggest problem right now with him is that<br/>\nhe seems to be allergic to a cleaner or a purfume in a cleaner.  We know<br/>\nZep carpet cleaner is a big no-no, but Wal-mart doesn&#39;t have carpet and<br/>\nsomething there sets him off too.  The reaction from wheat is more subtle<br/>\nand involves skin and wheezing and bowels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think it is important to make certain your kids understand why they<br/>\ncan&#39;t have certain foods.  It has taken several years but Wyndham is<br/>\nfinally getting the connection between how he feels and what he eats.  If<br/>\nI had not limited his foods though, he would never have known he could<br/>\nfeel good.  He is allergic to so many things that he would never have<br/>\nbeen allergen free to feel the difference.  For that matter, I would<br/>\nnever have figured out my own allergies without a really great doctor who<br/>\ntook the time to really explain things to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes and one other allergy related baby hint - If your baby is rashhy<br/>\nand no amount of lotion helps - try NO lotion.  When Rachel was a newborn<br/>\nbaby she had a constant full body rash.  I finally just gave up trying to<br/>\nmake it go away.  I washed her with water only and soap on the ucky parts<br/>\nonly.  I used no lotion or soap or powder anywhere on the rest of her. <br/>\nThe rashes magically cleared up.  Just because the nice nurse sent that<br/>\ncute bottle of lotion home with you, does not mean it is necessary or<br/>\neven good for every kid.  Wyndham was allergic to diapers with that gel<br/>\nstuff too, just another thing to think about.  Oh yes, and I had nasty<br/>\nred sore nipples.  The culprit was the nipple cream they sent home from<br/>\nthe hospital!<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>\ngoes on.<br/>\n                                                     - Robert Frost</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"lite2yu@aol.com","from":"lite2yu@...","profile":"lite2yu2000","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"F9Y6K9enMFepvW-loIaTdAzwLAe0qv056pkI46U4ItsLvSCr5NQXuE6mDvootYKdiEfJBWW3","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Allergies","postDate":"1005832390","msgId":27754,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0LjE2NTE5NjhhLjI5MjUyMmM2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27697,"nextInTopic":27755,"prevInTime":27753,"nextInTime":27755,"topicId":1944,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/14/2001 11:52:09 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

Yes, dyes and preservatives can be<br/>\nallergens and frequently are.  I highly recommend a book called, &quot;Is this<br/>\nyour child?&quot;  I often hear people talk about how their kid gets &#39;wired on<br/>\nsugar&#39;  and I&#39;d be willing to bet that in at least half those cases the<br/>\ntrue culprit is the baggage with the sugar.  You can use Kool-Aid as hair<br/>\ndye, why would you want to drink that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked about the symptoms, here are Wyndham&#39;s.  When he eats wheat he<br/>\nhas predominately intestinal symptoms with just a few behavioural ones<br/>\nthrown in.  Wheat will cause him to mess his pants and not know it is<br/>\ngoing to happen.    It will also cause him to get rashy and wheezy a bit.<br/>\n The chemical allergens act completely different.  The initial symptoms<br/>\nare behavioural.  He will go from a sweet little boy to Mr. Hyde in the<br/>\nspace of an hour.  I am always the first to see it coming because I can<br/>\nhear a change in the pitch of his voice.  He will bounce of the walls and<br/>\nact really bizarre.  He also will be more prone to the OCD symptoms I<br/>\ndiscussed earlier.  I believe all of this is connected, the ICD and<br/>\nallergies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting allergy symptom is handwriting.  There is a really<br/>\ngood example in the book I mentioned above.  I know with myself that I<br/>\ncan look at my handwriting and tell how close to a major allergy attack I<br/>\nam.

He was a<br/>\nmember of the Food Allergy Network, and very informed on the latest research<br/>\nregarding allergies.  He helped me through two hour long sessions identify<br/>\nand eliminate the most prominent allergens, and encouraged me to breastfeed<br/>\nmy son as long as I could.   We did scratch testing when he was nine months<br/>\nold and discovered his worst allergies were obviously dairy, dust, and mold.<br/>\nThis helped in managing his severe eczema.

Do you have any idea<br/>\nhow many things have NUTS in them?!  He can eat butter and yogurt, which do<br/>\nnot contain the dairy proteins that cause most allergies, and that is a big<br/>\nhelp to us as I can make him sandwiches with butter instead of Mayo, or<br/>\nmake buttered noodles, give him frozen yogurt in lieu of ice cream, etc.<br/>\nWe also look for foods with Calcium added (O.J., cereal bars, Eggo<br/>\nWaffles)to ensure that he gets enough in his diet.  He cannot eat the<br/>\ntypical kid things like canned pastas, cheese, ice cream, cake, pizza, most<br/>\ncookies, etc.  We also have to be careful with things like Ketchup.  He<br/>\nloves the stuff, and will eat it with a spoon, but it affects his sensative<br/>\nskin (as if his food allergies were not enough!!)  So if he is having<br/>\n&#39;tater tots&#39; or chicken nuggets or some such with ketchup, we have to keep<br/>\na damp towel handy and wipe off his face every few minutes or he gets a<br/>\nhivey rash around his mouth.  He eats a lot of whole foods (fruits and<br/>\nveggies) dried, jellied, raw, steamed or otherwise prepared simply, loves<br/>\nfish (although we are avoiding shellfish for now as a common allergen)<br/>\nchicken and other meats, and eats a lot of crackers (like wheat thins and<br/>\ngraham crackers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, when we are out to eat, we will construct meals out of several<br/>\nside dishes, or ask for a special meal for him if we cannot find anything<br/>\non the menu for him.  I sometimes make a seperate &quot;kids meal&quot; at home for<br/>\nthe boys (although our youngest has no known allergies of any type) if we<br/>\nadults would like to eat something Thomas cannot have.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I can get myself together to test for allergies soon, what would you<br/>\nsuggest<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;as the best place to start? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would not know about allergy testing.  Thomas is only 2.5 and too young<br/>\nfor it.  Anyway his protein type allergies (nuts, eggs, dairy) do not<br/>\nrespond to traditional testing.  We discovered his allergies the hard way,<br/>\nwith very scarey trips to the ER, particularly for the nut one.  The ER doc<br/>\nsaid it was a good thing he did not actually ingest any of the peanut<br/>\nbutter, but meerly played with it (his first try of peanut butter at age 1)<br/>\nor else I would never have made it to the hospital in time.  His reaction<br/>\nwas VERY severe.  We also had ER visits for Dairy allergy (9 months,) Egg<br/>\nallergy (15 months,) and Asthma (18 months.)  The pet allergies,<br/>\npreservative allergies and dust allergy were less severe and we were able<br/>\nto treat his reactions at home with the allergy medication we already had<br/>\non hand.  His sensative skin surfaced at about 6 weeks old when we had to<br/>\nput a humidifier in his room and cycled through several perscriptions<br/>\nlooking for something that worked on his Eczema and rashes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98585,"nextTopicId":98584}}
