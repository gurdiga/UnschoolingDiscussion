I find it <br/>\nheartbreaking.  When I worked for Dominoes Pizza (before being put on bedrest <br/>\nwith Briana)...we had this single mother who came in on Fridays.  She would <br/>\ncount her all her coins and then tell her 2 children that they could afford <br/>\nbreadsticks. After a week of robbing Peter to pay Paul, all she had was $1.99 <br/>\nleft over.  I ended up getting fired because I would send her home with 2 <br/>\nextra large pizzas, free of charge, and the bread sticks that she insisted on <br/>\npaying for.

She is raising these kids alone, father is not even<br/>\n&gt; involved(by his choice).

Of COURSE, situations<br/>\n&gt; like these, might be handled a little differently and more sensitively! <br/>\n&gt; I think few would argue that daycare has its place in these rare<br/>\n&gt; circumstances.  By far though, the families opting for non-parental<br/>\n&gt; care, are not of such dire circumstances.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Presently in Canada, the government is considering offering families a<br/>\n&gt; child care tax credit.  And that is regardless of what choice a family<br/>\n&gt; makes in terms of child care.  The same dollars that go into daycare<br/>\n&gt; subsidies could also go to the families with a stay-at-home mom.  In<br/>\n&gt; most situations those tax dollars could help make the difference for<br/>\n&gt; having a mom (or dad) at home.  As many have already written, by the<br/>\n&gt; time you pay for childcare, extra wardrobe, lunches, car, gas etc. to<br/>\n&gt; hold down a job, you have little left over.  A tax credit, equal to the<br/>\n&gt; minimal amount most have left over after expenses, would probably be a<br/>\n&gt; more efficient use of public funds.  Otherwise, it&#39;s a self-perpetuating<br/>\n&gt; process to trap kids in daycare. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is an unschooling issue in my mind.  Unschooling, &quot;un-daycare-ing&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s the same thing.  It&#39;s all about the de-institutionalization of<br/>\n&gt; children!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sonia<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!<br/>\n&gt; 1.

I do the admin <br/>\nstuff; he sets the tile.  He also employs his brother and an occassional <br/>\nadditional setter or helper as needed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are constantly amazed that my husband&#39;s brother does not &quot;get it&quot; - that <br/>\nhe wants to show up and do X amount of work and go home.  That&#39;s all he <br/>\nwants.  He doesn&#39;t want to assume any more of the responsibility and he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get any of the profits.  He gets a wage and that is all he wants. He <br/>\ncould get a license and start his own tile biz (he actually has much more <br/>\nexperience than my husband) but we see no sign that this will ever happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have both been employees in the course of our work lives and <br/>\nwe were pretty bad at it.  We are just not the employee type.  Some people <br/>\nare just not the boss type.  I&#39;m sure it is very complicated, psychologically <br/>\nspeaking, but I cannot see that anyone could or should change one set of <br/>\nthese people to the other type.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are not cut out to be bosses.  You apparently are, but, like so <br/>\nmany things, this does not mean it will fit everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So how about raising our daughters to not marry these bums...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of us do try to instill the proper values in our daughters (and <br/>\nour sons).  And yet . . . things happen which a mother cannot prevent or <br/>\npredict.  Certainly we can try to do our best but that doesn&#39;t mean a perfect <br/>\nhusband is ready or willing or needed for every girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, what is working in your life may not apply to others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me to be very hard to address these issues successfully unless we <br/>\ncan embrace world views that include others&#39; points of view.  <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, this is one of the issues that I find comes up periodically when I <br/>\nam with my children.  We discuss many things and I always try to inject some <br/>\nsort of perspective into the discussion.  I think it is very easy for them to <br/>\nget lost in their own little worlds, and even tho I try not to introduce <br/>\nthings too early that might upset them, I try to point out that others might <br/>\nfeel different than they do and that the other person&#39;s pov is valuable too <br/>\nand may make sense to them and so it is not kind or correct to criticize <br/>\nothers simply because they play ball differently or eat different food or <br/>\nhave a different sort of house or go to church or some such that is different <br/>\nfrom our life.  Children seem to me to have a hard time not being <br/>\nself-centered and certain that their way is the best way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, back to the Sunday paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m being waaaay lazy today!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lisa Bugg","from":"&quot;Lisa Bugg&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"mIzEj2BQSAFGO4_CU_69COJAugKgy2ErJn3021JEmAGIf8HI_xxWnLBEh7IGxGAkTSyLLjn6Dum4KVtxdtG7Avtrq1rGj-bsxey9oOA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]feminism","postDate":"961958023","msgId":9901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzNmIwMWJmZGVkMyRlNGVhNzZhMCQ4ZTgzYjAzZkBlZHVjYXRlPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3LjVlZWNiM2UuMjY4NzliNDBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9900,"nextInTopic":9903,"prevInTime":9900,"nextInTime":9902,"topicId":9772,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":". ... you ...

By far though, the families opting for non-parental<br/>\ncare, are not of such dire circumstances.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPresently in Canada, the government is considering offering families a<br/>\nchild care tax credit.  And that is regardless of what choice a family<br/>\nmakes in terms of child care.  The same dollars that go into daycare<br/>\nsubsidies could also go to the families with a stay-at-home mom.  In<br/>\nmost situations those tax dollars could help make the difference for<br/>\nhaving a mom (or dad) at home.  As many have already written, by the<br/>\ntime you pay for childcare, extra wardrobe, lunches, car, gas etc. to<br/>\nhold down a job, you have little left over.  A tax credit, equal to the<br/>\nminimal amount most have left over after expenses, would probably be a<br/>\nmore efficient use of public funds.

I wish I&#39;d said that!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know of instances where children have been in daycare or other<br/>\nsecond/third/fourth-best care and somehow still thrived.  But daycare is<br/>\na RISK.  (And so obviously is bad parenting...there may be the odd, one<br/>\nin hundred, child who&#39;s safer or better off in daycare but that&#39;s<br/>\nanother issue...)  There are lots of people who drive drunk and don&#39;t<br/>\nget in car accidents, but does that mean driving drunk is a good thing<br/>\nor appropriate!  I&#39;m not meaning to insult anyone or suggest that<br/>\nso-called &quot;working moms&quot; (Isn&#39;t EVERY mother a &quot;working mother&quot;?) are<br/>\nequivalent to drunk drivers but I&#39;m trying to illustrate that there is a<br/>\nRISK, in most non-parental care situations, and is it worth the gamble<br/>\nwhen not ABSOLUTELY necessary?  Besides, when nothing but the breast<br/>\nwill console a fussy or pained baby, can any babysitter provide that? <br/>\nMy neighbour, who is a very pleasant and wonderful woman, runs her own<br/>\nin-house daycare.  I see what goes on there in a supposedly &quot;good&quot;<br/>\nsituation, and she has her share of babies that basically spend the<br/>\nwhole day crying for their mothers.  It is beyond pitiful to see.  I<br/>\nthink society grossly underestimates the heroic role mothers play in the<br/>\ndevelopment of their children.  There are far too many babies suffering<br/>\nneedlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we deny mothers and our children, we deny womanhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDia Garland wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; And I feel it is important to remember that there may be points during<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life when one set of circumstances fits and then another period where<br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; set fits.

One may have a career.  A calling. Or a job.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I heartily disagree with the sentiment that women have the right to work and<br/>\n&gt; leave their kids in daycare.  Noone has the right to work when it interferes<br/>\n&gt; with the rights of another.  Actually none of us even have a *right* to<br/>\n&gt; work, it is not listed in our bill of rights anywhere!
