I know the grass looks<br/>\n&gt; greener on the other side and no I dont want to be them but it all does way<br/>\n&gt; heavy on my heart.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (((Laura))),<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It IS hard.  We spent the first seven years of marriage dirt poor.  Lost <br/>\n&gt; our <br/>\n&gt; first house to foreclosure and often wondered where our next meal was <br/>\n&gt; coming <br/>\n&gt; from.  We were renting a house with a terrible landlord and spent three <br/>\n&gt; months in a sewage backup, not having the money to hire an attorney to get <br/>\n&gt; us out.  We had a four bedroom home and could only use one room.  About <br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; time, my mom lost her job and didn&#39;t want to lose her house, so we moved in <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and took over payments, which she didn&#39;t send in and now we are in HER <br/>\n&gt; foreclosure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband fell into an high paying job and I really thought things would <br/>\n&gt; turn around for us.  I wasn&#39;t really worried about getting forced out of <br/>\n&gt; this house because we now have the money to buy any house we want, well <br/>\n&gt; cover the payments, lol.  Problem is, we can&#39;t get anyone to look at us <br/>\n&gt; because of our credit.  Renting/leasing looks even worse.  They see our <br/>\n&gt; foreclosure and dumped lease house and won&#39;t even consider us, even with a <br/>\n&gt; sizeable downpayment/security deposit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other side of the coin is that my husband is NEVER home.  Chloe is 7.5 <br/>\n&gt; months old and Chis has been home a collective 2 months of that time.  I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; thankful we don&#39;t have the financial struggles but the price is too high.  <br/>\n&gt; When he&#39;s home, Caeleb and Chloe take a few days to warm up to him.  I <br/>\n&gt; really believe they don&#39;t recognize him when he gets back from trips.  Just <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; when they warm up to him again, he&#39;s gone on another trip.  We&#39;ve talked <br/>\n&gt; about him finding another job where he can be home more but he can&#39;t find <br/>\n&gt; anything in the middle.  It&#39;s either this job or something that won&#39;t cover <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; the bills, much less food.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ironic that you should mention te grocery store outing.  The last time I <br/>\n&gt; went grocery shopping, I was standing behind a family of four.  Mom, Dad, <br/>\n&gt; and two girls.  They were sifting through their coupons and the mom was <br/>\n&gt; adding everything up on the calculator, hoping (aloud) that they wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have to put anything back.  Dad was playing with the baby who was smiling <br/>\n&gt; and cooing at him and the older girl was riding piggyback laughing over his <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; shoulder.  Here I was, the person NOT paying attention to what was in the <br/>\n&gt; cart, wishing like hell I had to count coupons because it would mean my <br/>\n&gt; husband would be there, helping me with the kids, playing with our babies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a double edged sword and it cuts no matter where you touch it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could all just fall in the middle?  I long to <br/>\n&gt; live <br/>\n&gt; in a cooperative community.  Commune??  Where everyone shares the load, <br/>\n&gt; barters for what they need and all the families live happily.  Is there <br/>\n&gt; even <br/>\n&gt; such a place?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for everyone&#39;s support!<br/>\nJennifer as for the house that&#39;s what I am trying to avoid. My lawyer cant <br/>\nanswer me as to weather would loose it.  I think im just going to file and <br/>\nhope for the best, I cannot take the stress anymore. It is leaving me angry.<br/>\nYes, there is such a place. I saw an email on it a few weeks ago.  I do think <br/>\nthough that they where all book HS&#39;ers.  But it did sound kinda neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think today I am looking at things a bit better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68855,"nextTopicId":68857}}
