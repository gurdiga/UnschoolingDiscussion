We just <br/>\nhappened upon it after dessert, and it was mostly empty  and a guy was playing <br/>\nlove songs and it was non-smoking, so we stepped in for a  drink.  We listened <br/>\nand talked and pretty soon I realized *this* was the  place someone was <br/>\ntelling me about how fun it was.  We found out the  dueling piano guys were going to <br/>\nstart in about an hour, so we decided to  stay.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was amazing.  They were very talented, and there were  three of them.  Not <br/>\nonly did they play piano, but to keep the evening  going, they rotated in <br/>\naround the pianos to play a drum set and guitar.   That&#39;s how one guy got a break <br/>\nwhile the other two kept the act going.  It  was very participatory and we <br/>\nsang all night.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI sat there all night thinking, &quot;I wish I could play like  that!&quot;  &quot;I wish I <br/>\ncould sing like that.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nI am not going to out to buy a piano.  I don&#39;t want to  learn how to do it.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t have that kind of talent.  I want it, but  I don&#39;t to learn it.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] How do you support a child&#39;s goal?","postDate":"1124050088","msgId":107783,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxMC42ZGNhMWUxLjMwMzBmZWE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107782,"nextInTopic":107784,"prevInTime":107782,"nextInTime":107784,"topicId":107757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/14/2005 1:35:53 PM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: Neither are fountain pens.

He doesn&#39;t set too many long  range goals (except <br/>\nto play in the Majors--really looong range). So I can&#39;t  help you with that.  <br/>\nI got to thinking this might not be about goal  setting, but more about <br/>\nreadiness to write.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son also has very illegible handwriting and he can&#39;t  write in small <br/>\nspaces (like registration cards).  He holds any writing  instrument with his thumb <br/>\nand all 4 fingers (not in his fist, but between his  thumb and pinkie and the <br/>\nother three fingers stacked up the pencil).  That  method is really bad for <br/>\nmaking fine details.  He&#39;s been doing it that way  since he started drawing at 2 <br/>\nor 3, and resisted my attempts to show him an  easier way, so I&#39;ve let it go <br/>\nfor years.<br/>\n <br/>\n  He is always amazed in a &quot;wish I could do that&quot;  way at how fast I write <br/>\nwhen he sees me write something.  Early  on I attributed his inability to not <br/>\nbeing literate, and then not knowing a lot  of spelling (having to think about <br/>\nit too much).  Then when he could read  and spell, it would occur to me that <br/>\nthe physical part was in the way,  too.  Then there&#39;s the desire aspect.  He <br/>\njust wasn&#39;t ready, in some  way or another.  So, I usually just said something <br/>\nlike, &quot;Oh,  you&#39;ll be able to write as fast as you need to, someday&quot;.  Sometimes <br/>\n we&#39;d have a conversation about why he thought he couldn&#39;t write that fast, <br/>\nand  I&#39;d reassure him that some day his muscles in his hand and his ability to <br/>\nget  his words down to his fingertips would develop eventually.  Just like his <br/>\n pitching arm has gotten faster and his hand able to grip the ball for <br/>\ndifferent  pitches as he got older and bigger (to put it in a perspective he can  <br/>\nunderstand &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust the other day, we were talking about it,  again.  The dental hygenist <br/>\nfound out he was homeschooled and  asked him a math question in the context of <br/>\nthe treatment (hours in a  day divided by (12) hours it takes bacteria to <br/>\ncolonize = how  many times a day you must brush your teeth).  At the end of  the <br/>\nexam she gave him a reminder card to fill out write his  address on.  He handed <br/>\nit to me and I filled it out, even though it was  clear she wanted him to do <br/>\nit.  When he gave it to me, he said, &quot;You know  more of this information than I <br/>\ndo.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the car he brought it up again, how he doesn&#39;t feel  comfortable writing <br/>\ntoo much.  This time it was about the way he holds his  pencil.  He said, <br/>\n&quot;Maybe I oughta try holding it the way you do.  My  hand gets sore when I do it the <br/>\nway I do it.&quot;  That was his first hint  *ever* that he thought there might be <br/>\nsome validity to a different way to do it  other than &quot;his&quot; way.  When he <br/>\nfirst really resisted when he was 2 or 3, I  just told him his way was fine for <br/>\nhim, and other people did it  differently.  He just grabbed on to that &quot;my <br/>\nway!&quot; and never let go.   I never pushed it, although I did occasionally suggest <br/>\nit might be better this  way or that way if I was helping him with something.<br/>\n <br/>\nI attribute his change of heart to maturity and  readiness.  Some people can <br/>\npick something up right away...it&#39;s  natural for them.  With some, it&#39;s more <br/>\nof a developmental  thing.  I&#39;m happy I never made Will do handwriting lessons. <br/>\n I&#39;m happy  that he had the guts and determination to say &quot;his way&quot; was best <br/>\nfor him,  because that&#39;s served him well (in other areas, too).  Some day <br/>\nhe&#39;ll have  a burning desire or pressing need to have legible handwriting (or <br/>\nnot--then  he&#39;ll learn other coping skills), and at that point he can learn to do <br/>\nit in a  short time.  All the components for it will be in place.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: How do you support a child&#39;s goal?","postDate":"1124047094","msgId":107778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRkbzVkbStlbmtxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRkbzQyayszcjBsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107777,"nextInTopic":107782,"prevInTime":107777,"nextInTime":107779,"topicId":107757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So he&#39;ll start a related project and the whole cycle<br/>\nrepeats itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is something in your description of the kids setting goals that  <br/>\n&gt; is bothering me - making me itch a little.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to hear what the other goals are like - the kinds of goals  <br/>\n&gt; the other child is &quot;quitting&quot; and then hating himself for quitting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Those are some STRONG words you used.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m torn, in answering, because of this odd itchy feeling your post  <br/>\n&gt; is giving me. I know one thing that&#39;s bothering me, a little, though  <br/>\n&gt; - that is the way you described his asking for help to help him  <br/>\n&gt; improve his handwriting. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is my other son (who is 11). He&#39;s been totally unschooled for<br/>\nthree years. He spends his time on the computer and X Box. And I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen totally fine with it. Really.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d expect to hear about the ways HE has  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; decided to go about doing it - it isn&#39;t at all hard for an 11 yo kid  <br/>\n&gt; to figure out how to improve his own handwriting - to come up with  <br/>\n&gt; ways to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He did. He came and asked me for a pen, a notebook and the cookbook<br/>\nstand to put his poetry book in.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got frustrated with the look of his writing and asked if I could<br/>\nhelp him with the lettering. He really doesn&#39;t have a handle yet on<br/>\nthe formation of the letters when he writes them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n So it is giving me pause that he&#39;s coming to you for  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; help as he is. I mean - he could come and say, &quot;I need you to write  <br/>\n&gt; something for me to trace,&quot; or &quot;Write the letters for me so I can see  <br/>\n&gt; what good handwriting looks like.&quot; Or he could come and say, &quot;I want  <br/>\n&gt; to buy a handwriting workbook.&quot; Or there are MANY things he might ask  <br/>\n&gt; you, Julie. But - there is something overly helpless in the way you  <br/>\n&gt; described him asking AND here you are asking us. It is like you&#39;re  <br/>\n&gt; going to take charge - come up with a system of learning FOR him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you have a kid who asks you for help, what do you do? Just put<br/>\nit back on him and see what happens?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; IF that is the way your other son&#39;s goals have been approached, then  <br/>\n&gt; ONE reason they&#39;ve failed is because they were too much yours and not  <br/>\n&gt; enough his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know this well enough to know not to make it my goal for him. Yes.<br/>\nHe&#39;s always been the most sensitive to anyone controlling his time or<br/>\nbehavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m here asking. I don&#39;t typically structure his<br/>\nlife at all. We read aloud because he loves it, we read poetry<br/>\nfrequently (he loves teatimes where we read poetry), we bird watch, he<br/>\nplays his games. He made a notebook last year with an island chain<br/>\nthat he created and would ask me to help him to work on it since it<br/>\ninvolved writing. I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s asking for help with handwriting so I want to be a help, not<br/>\nan unwitting hindrance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The way you know someone is serious about achieving a goal is that  <br/>\n&gt; THEY come up with the steps to do so and THEY work on the first step  <br/>\n&gt; until they succeed and then THEY move on to the second.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do kids already know the steps for learning to handwrite comfortably<br/>\nand beautifully? I thought my job is to help provide resources and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I have a feeling you&#39;re getting involved too quickly. I know  <br/>\n&gt; there is a fine line between being supportive and getting too  <br/>\n&gt; involved - but I just have this underlying feeling that you&#39;re doing  <br/>\n&gt; the latter.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So - oddly enough - my suggestion for you is to back off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can casually say, &quot;Oh - don&#39;t get too worried about it - LOTS of  <br/>\n&gt; really brilliant successful people have trouble with handwriting,&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; And if he insists that he wants some &quot;system&quot; for improving his, you  <br/>\n&gt; can say, &quot;Handwriting usually just gets better with practice and as  <br/>\n&gt; people get older.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm. Okay. So even though this has been how I&#39;ve handled it for the<br/>\nlast two years, I ought to keep going.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel like you&#39;re taking over the MOST important part of this - the  <br/>\n&gt; process of figuring out how to respond, himself, to his OWN feelings,  <br/>\n&gt; urges, desires - how to figure out how to get what he wants.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If one of my daughters had come to me and said, &quot;I want to learn to  <br/>\n&gt; read,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t immediately start trying to figure out some system  <br/>\n&gt; for helping her learn to read. I&#39;d say, &quot;I know. You will.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow. Really?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay that is really new to me. My daughter is nearly nine, not reading<br/>\nfluently at all. When she asks for help, I&#39;ve helped her. She&#39;s<br/>\nstruggled all along so when it&#39;s hard I suggest letting it go and<br/>\nwaiting until she feels ready to try again. I always assure her that<br/>\nshe&#39;ll read. But it never occurred to me to do nothing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just have this feeling that you&#39;re taking over the goals - at least  <br/>\n&gt; just a bit. Maybe you&#39;re worried about his poor penmanship and just a  <br/>\n&gt; little too pleased at the chance that he&#39;ll improve it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Worried... Hmmm. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m worried. I was happy he wanted to<br/>\nimprove it mostly because it was touching to me that he came up with<br/>\nthat idea himself. I haven&#39;t had a kid have that impulse before<br/>\nbecause I had always scheduled handwriting before I fully unschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking that what both kids sound like they need to learn is not  <br/>\n&gt; how to achieve their goals, but how to relax and let the learning  <br/>\n&gt; happen naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>After reading my older son&#39;s description, would you still say this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Too much &quot;goal-setting&#39; for young kids who are  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; better off living in the here and now and not feeling ashamed or  <br/>\n&gt; guilty (and therefore hating themselves) and too much thinking YOU  <br/>\n&gt; have responsibility for their learning. You&#39;re just not really away  <br/>\n&gt; from that mindset far enough - that&#39;s what is making me itchy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Got it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The best &quot;help&quot; you could give him would be NOT to step in and  <br/>\n&gt; organize his learning for him - but to just say encouraging things  <br/>\n&gt; like, &quot;You&#39;ll learn. It&#39;ll happen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Respond to his SPECIFIC requests, of course. But I think you have to  <br/>\n&gt; lay off MORE than some other people, at least for a while, because  <br/>\n&gt; your kids are still asking you to be responsible for their learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is very true. Thank you for putting it like this. I can<br/>\nsee this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So even offering a whole list of possible ideas of how he can improve  <br/>\n&gt; his handwriting - and letting him decide which of your ideas he might  <br/>\n&gt; choose to try to reach his goals - I think that is coming across as  <br/>\n&gt; handing the responsibility over to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh - and I&#39;m also going to guess that he really doesn&#39;t, in fact,  <br/>\n&gt; want to spend time working to improve his handwriting. He just wants  <br/>\n&gt; it to be better. Those are different.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lol! Well, we&#39;ll see, right? He wrote for fifteen minutes all on his<br/>\nown yesterday with no prompting from anyone and then put it away<br/>\nwithout even showing it to me. That spoke volumes to me. I found the<br/>\nnotebook on the couch and noticed he had written an entire poem (which<br/>\nis hard for him).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your son wants to HAVE good handwriting.<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re interpreting that as if he wants to LEARN to have good  <br/>\n&gt; handwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, he did say he wants to &quot;work on his handwriting because it<br/>\nwould be cool to have beauitful handwriting&quot; (those are his exact words).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think you&#39;re jumping in with ideas of how to improve his  <br/>\n&gt; handwriting - but if he really wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d  <br/>\n&gt; be figuring out how to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If he wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d be WRITING all the time,  <br/>\n&gt; trying to do it better and better. It would be on his OWN initiative,  <br/>\n&gt; he would not need to ask you for help with that unless he needed you  <br/>\n&gt; to get him paper or pens or something concrete like help him find  <br/>\n&gt; writing samples to trace or copy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is precisely what he asked for. I think what I was wondering (and<br/>\nyou&#39;ve now answered it) is if I needed to remind him of the goal he<br/>\nset for himself when it got hard. I think what you are saying is to<br/>\nlet it be totally his goal, whether he goes after it or not. I don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to &quot;hold&quot; his goal for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; When your son asks for paper and pens to practice his handwriting -  <br/>\n&gt; help him with that. Be really careful that you&#39;re not making too big  <br/>\n&gt; a deal out of &quot;goals.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great. got it. Thanks that was helpful. If you have something to say<br/>\nabout my older son (18) that would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him recently that I didn&#39;t think he should be relying on me to<br/>\nhelp him reach his goals - that he will have to work out what it is in<br/>\nhim that helps him get there. I&#39;m wondering if from reading your post<br/>\nhere if he has internalized me as his goal-keeping partner that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t yet know what it is to finish what he cares about without<br/>\ndepending on someone else to push him, remind him, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] How do you support a child&#39;s goal?","postDate":"1124044532","msgId":107773,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRmLjE5OTNjNmZiLjMwMzBlOGY0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107772,"nextInTopic":107775,"prevInTime":107772,"nextInTime":107774,"topicId":107757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know one thing that&#39;s bothering me, a little, though  <br/>\n- that is the way you described his asking for help to help him  <br/>\nimprove his handwriting. I&#39;d expect to hear about the ways HE has  <br/>\ndecided to go about doing it - it isn&#39;t at all hard for an 11 yo kid  <br/>\nto figure out how to improve his own handwriting - to come up with  <br/>\nways to do that. So it is giving me pause that he&#39;s coming to you for  <br/>\nhelp as he is. I mean - he could come and say, &quot;I need you to write  <br/>\nsomething for me to trace,&quot; or &quot;Write the letters for me so I can see  <br/>\nwhat good handwriting looks like.&quot; Or he could come and say, &quot;I want  <br/>\nto buy a handwriting workbook.&quot; Or there are MANY things he might ask  <br/>\nyou, Julie. But - there is something overly helpless in the way you  <br/>\ndescribed him asking AND here you are asking us. It is like you&#39;re  <br/>\ngoing to take charge - come up with a system of learning FOR him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF that is the way your other son&#39;s goals have been approached, then  <br/>\nONE reason they&#39;ve failed is because they were too much yours and not  <br/>\nenough his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way you know someone is serious about achieving a goal is that  <br/>\nTHEY come up with the steps to do so and THEY work on the first step  <br/>\nuntil they succeed and then THEY move on to the second.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have a feeling you&#39;re getting involved too quickly. I know  <br/>\nthere is a fine line between being supportive and getting too  <br/>\ninvolved - but I just have this underlying feeling that you&#39;re doing  <br/>\nthe latter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - oddly enough - my suggestion for you is to back off.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can casually say, &quot;Oh - don&#39;t get too worried about it - LOTS of  <br/>\nreally brilliant successful people have trouble with handwriting,&quot;  <br/>\nAnd if he insists that he wants some &quot;system&quot; for improving his, you  <br/>\ncan say, &quot;Handwriting usually just gets better with practice and as  <br/>\npeople get older.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like you&#39;re taking over the MOST important part of this - the  <br/>\nprocess of figuring out how to respond, himself, to his OWN feelings,  <br/>\nurges, desires - how to figure out how to get what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of my daughters had come to me and said, &quot;I want to learn to  <br/>\nread,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t immediately start trying to figure out some system  <br/>\nfor helping her learn to read. I&#39;d say, &quot;I know. You will.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just have this feeling that you&#39;re taking over the goals - at least  <br/>\njust a bit. Maybe you&#39;re worried about his poor penmanship and just a  <br/>\nlittle too pleased at the chance that he&#39;ll improve it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that what both kids sound like they need to learn is not  <br/>\nhow to achieve their goals, but how to relax and let the learning  <br/>\nhappen naturally. Too much &quot;goal-setting&#39; for young kids who are  <br/>\nbetter off living in the here and now and not feeling ashamed or  <br/>\nguilty (and therefore hating themselves) and too much thinking YOU  <br/>\nhave responsibility for their learning. You&#39;re just not really away  <br/>\nfrom that mindset far enough - that&#39;s what is making me itchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best &quot;help&quot; you could give him would be NOT to step in and  <br/>\norganize his learning for him - but to just say encouraging things  <br/>\nlike, &quot;You&#39;ll learn. It&#39;ll happen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRespond to his SPECIFIC requests, of course. But I think you have to  <br/>\nlay off MORE than some other people, at least for a while, because  <br/>\nyour kids are still asking you to be responsible for their learning.  <br/>\nSo even offering a whole list of possible ideas of how he can improve  <br/>\nhis handwriting - and letting him decide which of your ideas he might  <br/>\nchoose to try to reach his goals - I think that is coming across as  <br/>\nhanding the responsibility over to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - and I&#39;m also going to guess that he really doesn&#39;t, in fact,  <br/>\nwant to spend time working to improve his handwriting. He just wants  <br/>\nit to be better. Those are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to BE a good horse rider.<br/>\nMy daughter wants to LEARN to be a good rider.<br/>\n<br/>\nI seldom get on a horse.<br/>\nShe spent hours and hours, several days per week, ON  a horse.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son wants to HAVE good handwriting.<br/>\nYou&#39;re interpreting that as if he wants to LEARN to have good  <br/>\nhandwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say I want to BE a good horse rider, I really don&#39;t need  <br/>\nanybody to give me a list of options as to how I could learn to be a  <br/>\ngood rider. If I really wanted to LEARN to ride, I&#39;d be figuring out  <br/>\nhow to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re jumping in with ideas of how to improve his  <br/>\nhandwriting - but if he really wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d  <br/>\nbe figuring out how to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t that hard to tell the difference between a kid wanting to  <br/>\nlearn something versus just wishing they KNEW something. Sounds like  <br/>\nyou need to be more aware of that difference and not respond to the  <br/>\nlatter - you really need to let them have that experience of wishing  <br/>\nthey knew something but not really wanting to spend time or energy  <br/>\nlearning it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d be WRITING all the time,  <br/>\ntrying to do it better and better. It would be on his OWN initiative,  <br/>\nhe would not need to ask you for help with that unless he needed you  <br/>\nto get him paper or pens or something concrete like help him find  <br/>\nwriting samples to trace or copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter wanted to LEARN to ride horses, she asked for a  <br/>\nhorse! &lt;G&gt; Pretty concrete. She said, &quot;I want to find somewhere that  <br/>\nI can ride horses.&quot; Okay - that is a specific request and I was able  <br/>\nto help her with THAT one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your son asks for paper and pens to practice his handwriting -  <br/>\nhelp him with that. Be really careful that you&#39;re not making too big  <br/>\na deal out of &quot;goals.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227139139,"authorName":"elizabeth roberts","from":"elizabeth roberts &lt;joyfullzoo@...&gt;","profile":"joyfullzoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] How do you support a child&#39;s goal?","postDate":"1124034795","msgId":107768,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwODE0MTU1MzE1Ljk5NjU0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRkbmgwcisycmNnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107767,"nextInTopic":107772,"prevInTime":107767,"nextInTime":107769,"topicId":107757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe a nice calligraphy set and plenty of paper to practice with?

He keyboards very well and he likes to copy poetry.<br/>\nSo he&#39;s done that off and on according to his own interests for the<br/>\nlast several years.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last week, he went paintballing and had to fill out one of those<br/>\nlittle forms.

He said it would be nice to be able to draw well (he wants<br/>\nto work for Wizards of the Coast some day desigining gaming cards...)<br/>\nand to have &quot;beautiful handwriting&quot; (his words). :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to help him without it becoming a chore. I talked with him<br/>\nabout what feels like the best approach and he gave me ideas. He began<br/>\non his own yesterday. Thing is, this isn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s brought<br/>\nup wanting to work on handwriting. We&#39;ve moved downt hat path before<br/>\nbut then he gets frustrated and stops.
