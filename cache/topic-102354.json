It&#39;s Wednesday, January 5, 2004 and time for Language Arts at<br/>\n&gt; ClickSchooling!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d like to thank list member, Michael G., who recommended two websites<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; offer FREE old-time radio shows in mp3 format that you can download and<br/>\n&gt; listen to with your family. Develop listening skills, great vocabulary,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; get a glimpse of entertainment prior to the advent of television. The<br/>\n&gt; historical significance of some of these programs (many with controversial<br/>\n&gt; themes) can launch lots of discussion around the house. Of course, you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; also find pure entertainment in the form of dramatic interpretations of<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; of the world&#39;s greatest literature. Here are the radio websites, with<br/>\n&gt; descriptions taken directly from the sites...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recommended Websites:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; RadioLovers.com<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.radiolovers.com\">http://www.radiolovers.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; RadioLovers.com offers hundreds of vintage radio shows for you to listen<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; online in mp3 format, all for free. Before the days of video games,<br/>\nshopping<br/>\n&gt; malls, MTV, and the Internet, families used to sit in their living room<br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; night to listen to radio shows such as Abbott and Costello, Superman,<br/>\n&gt; Groucho Marx, The Avenger, Gunsmoke, Sherlock Homes and many others. When<br/>\nTV<br/>\n&gt; become popular in the 1950s, most of these shows went off the air, but<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; now live on at Web sites such as this one and on weekly nostalgia radio<br/>\n&gt; broadcasts worldwide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mercury Theatre On The Air<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unknown.nu/mercury/\">http://www.unknown.nu/mercury/</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The finest radio drama of the 1930s was The Mercury Theatre on the Air, a<br/>\n&gt; show featuring the acclaimed New York drama company founded by Orson<br/>\nWelles<br/>\n&gt; and John Houseman. In its brief run, it featured an impressive array of<br/>\n&gt; talents, including Agnes Moorehead, Bernard Herrmann, and George<br/>\nCoulouris.<br/>\n&gt; The show is famous for its notorious &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast, but<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; other shows in the series are relatively unknown. This site has many of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; surviving shows, and will eventually have all of them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The show first broadcast on CBS and CBC in July 1938. It ran without a<br/>\n&gt; sponsor until December of that year, when it was picked up by Campbell&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Soup and renamed &quot;The Campbell Playhouse.&quot; All of the surviving Mercury<br/>\n&gt; Theatre shows are available from this page in RealAudio format (some are<br/>\n&gt; also in MP3 format). There are several Campbell Playhouse episodes<br/>\navailable<br/>\n&gt; here as well, in both RealAudio and MP3 formats. The rest are being added<br/>\n&gt; gradually.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Note: If you would rather not install Real Player on your computer, you<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; install Real Alternative, allowing you to play RealMedia files without<br/>\n&gt; having to install RealPlayer/RealOne Player.
