The key I<br/>\nsoon learned.....water.  Not too much, not too little.  Second most<br/>\nimportant, the amount of light a plant receives.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlants for the kids outside to start from seed - herbs.  When the last frost<br/>\nis done, chuck the seeds in some dirt and add water.  Parsley, dill and<br/>\nbasil are SO easy to grow from seed, and most rewarding.  Even better is my<br/>\nfavorite, chives - they came back for me this year(surprisingly enough<br/>\nbecause I grew them from seeds I had tucked for about 3 years).  Herbs are<br/>\nhardy - stay away from lavender - that is tough unless you have an abundance<br/>\nof sandy-ish soil and full sun.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know what zone you are in(or what state), soon you may be able to<br/>\nthrow a clove of garlic in the dirt and you have your own fresh in late<br/>\nfall.<br/>\n<br/>\nStart easy with the gardening, maybe just some hardy annual (impatient or<br/>\ngeranium), just so you can get the feel of it.
