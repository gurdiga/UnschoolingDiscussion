I was so angry at the schools for sending home all this homework for young children. Like the 8 hours a day they had them wasn&#39;t enough. But once I gave them the option to be at home and they decided to go back to school because they missed their friends ( and honestly  I believe they are so brainwashed by school and friends they truly believe they&#39;ll be stupid if they don&#39;t go) I started to question what the right thing to do is. I mean helping them feels right because I love them and want them to succeed at what&#39;s important to them, but I also feel like an enabler at times. Enabling them to stay in a situation that I don&#39;t think is all that healthy by not making them suffer the consequences of either the hours of homework and the time it takes away from family and friends or not doing it and dealing with the teacher comments/punishements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is they are slowly seeing that their sisters and brother at home are learning the important things like reading and having a great time all day too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with what that author said for parents stuck sending their kids to school. Why make a kid with no choice suffer any more then they have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the info.<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: The Scanlons <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, November 05, 2003 4:55 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Sandra question about an article you wrote<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kathy,<br/>\n  I read in a book called One to One about homework help.
