My situation is a little different because he has a big sister, but she","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-506617680\">I understand a little bit how you feel because I also<br/>\nhave a 4 year old unschooled boy. My situation is a<br/>\nlittle different because he has a big sister, but she<br/>\noften has friends over and he gets left out. <br/>\nMy suggestions are twofold:<br/>\nFirst, I would start a local unschooling group,<br/>\nperhaps even focused on preschool/kindergarden age. I<br/>\nwould make up flyers and post them anywhere parents<br/>\ngo: Library, Health food store, grocery store,<br/>\nplaygrouds, baby product stores, etc. where they will<br/>\nlet you put up flyers. There may be parents who have<br/>\ndecided to postpone sending their child to<br/>\nkindergarden for one year who are also looking for<br/>\nplaymates. You may even want to start a yahoo group<br/>\njust for local unschoolers. Advertize it to all<br/>\nhomeschoolers in the area, the word will eventually<br/>\nget around! I did this and to my surprise have 22<br/>\nmembers within on month. Of course I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nbig of a town you live in, but I think it&#39;s woth a<br/>\ntry. I bet there are people out there in the same<br/>\nsituation as you are in, and all you really need are 3<br/>\nor 4 that you get along with and you can get to know<br/>\nthem and start trading babysitting eventually.<br/>\nAlso, on a sunny day, go to playgrounds, walk up to<br/>\nMoms who are there with kids his age and strike up a<br/>\nconversation. You will eventually meet some friends.<br/>\nRegarding the second isssue, about him being too<br/>\nrough, I don&#39;t think it is sexist to want him to play<br/>\nwith boys and to encourage that. I have a daughter who<br/>\nis very rough and tumble, very active and loved<br/>\nplaying with boys up to a certain age, and then no<br/>\nmore! I think it is a developmental phase they go<br/>\nthrough. As long as you don&#39;t deny him the opportunity<br/>\nto play with a girl who wants to be rough and tumble,<br/>\nI don&#39;t see any harm in trying to find more boys for<br/>\nhim. They do have a big reserve of testosterone after<br/>\nall and they do sometimes act in ways that are very<br/>\n&quot;boyish&quot;, I think if we honor that in our sons we can<br/>\nreally help their self esteem in the long run rather<br/>\nthat act like it is negative is some way.<br/>\nThat said, of course he shouldn&#39;t hurt anyone, and<br/>\nfrom your description, I wonder if he might not suffer<br/>\nfrom food allergies. Have you looked into that at all?<br/>\nI hope some of this helps, <br/>\nD-<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nDenise Thomas<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease visit us at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NWAcohousingcommunity\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NWAcohousingcommunity</a> to learn more about the cohousing community currently forming in Nortwest Arkansas.

Unless I have a headache. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is that he is a very active, loud, spirited child who enjoys<br/>\n&gt; playing around other children but often just gets too rough.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you talked to him about the too rough?

Maybe it&#39;s because his play often turns rough.  It <br/>\nseems some people think that really rough play is a &quot;boy being a boy&quot; <br/>\nwhen in reality it is play out of control and that child needs some help <br/>\nplaying more gently. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Although some people do come over to our house for a playdate<br/>\n&gt; when invited, he is not a child who others seek out to play with, and <br/>\n&gt; many<br/>\n&gt; parents aren&#39;t too keen on him playing with their kids because of his <br/>\n&gt; activity<br/>\n&gt; level I&#39;m guessing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have two very active children.

I&#39;m hoping to perhaps find homeschoolers who are closer to us <br/>\n&gt; who aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; the school-at-home type.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry this is so long.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Amanda, I am not going to respond to every bit of what you say.  It <br/>\nseems to me that your child needs a few things.  First, little girls can <br/>\nbehave just as you say above.  Stop being so sexist.  Your child needs <br/>\nto be in a play group with children of all ages and sexes.  Second, if <br/>\nyour child has a hard time understanding physical boundries and rules <br/>\nfor play, then he needs your one on one help continually to get that <br/>\nmessage.  When he&#39;s playing with another child, you should be RIGHT <br/>\nTHERE, next to him.  You and your son should come up with a signal you <br/>\ncan give him when he is is starting to get rough--it can simply be a <br/>\ntouch on his arm or a secret code word.  With that word, or touch, he <br/>\ncan then back off, count to ten, or have some other self-controlling <br/>\nactivity to do until he gets it together.  It seems that your son might <br/>\nneed to find a lot of other really gentle children to play with so he <br/>\ncan model THOSE behaviors, instead of putting him in with other &quot;active&quot; <br/>\nboys.  A lot of time I see parents of active children sitting with the <br/>\nother parents across the park when the mom of the active child needs to <br/>\nbe WITH her child, all the time, in order to help that child learn the <br/>\nskills he or she needs to behave in a social setting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not at all convinced that all children under the age of five or six <br/>\nneed constant interaction of children their own age. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that the best way for your child to find and make friends <br/>\nis for you to be right there helping him through the process and <br/>\nteaching him one on one constantly what behaviors he needs to be a friend. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Amanda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
