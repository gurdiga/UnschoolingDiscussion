Ugh, it seems so obvious that this is <br/>\nthe best way for her to hate piano.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Laura J<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I started piano lessons at about age 7. (your hands aren&#39;t usually <br/>\nbig enough to span an octave before then, so the teacher I had said <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t really a good idea to start formal lessons then) I liked <br/>\nplaying around on the piano that my mother had bought a couple of <br/>\nyears before. She has always wanted to play the piano, read music, <br/>\netc. She drug my butt to lessons once a week, made me practice with a <br/>\ntimer, every day for six freakin years.. She learned to keep the <br/>\ntimer with her, or set her watch, because I&#39;d change the time on it. <br/>\nShe forced my sister to do the same thing. We both had musical <br/>\ninterests, but were not asked if we wanted to take piano lessons, and <br/>\nif we wanted to do something else, outside of school band or choir, <br/>\nthe piano lesson thing was always brought up. &quot;Well you didn&#39;t try <br/>\nwith piano lessons, so why should I pay money for you to not try at <br/>\nsomething else??&quot; Yes my mother is a gem. NOT!<br/>\nBut anyway, Both my sister and I hated piano, and wouldn&#39;t even sit <br/>\ndown and play after we quit lessons if my mom was home. I am probably <br/>\ngetting a keyboard of some kind for either Christmas or my birthday, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m not taking lessons, I want to teach myself. And if the kids <br/>\nshow an interest, I&#39;ll certainly encourage it, but it&#39;s going to have <br/>\nto come from them, because it will backfire if it doesn&#39;t. I know <br/>\nthat from personal experience. You cannot really force someone to <br/>\nlearn and retain something long term. It just doesn&#39;t work. <br/>\nNisha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] classes for kids","postDate":"1097634480","msgId":100623,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNkM5MkIwLjgwMTA4MDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMzYwMWM0YjBjOCQ3NzA1NGI4MCQ2ZjYzMDgwNEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQtREFWMTFqV0M1cU5wSXgwMDAwMTM0Y0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDAwMzYwMWM0YjBjOCQ3NzA1NGI4MCQ2ZjYzMDgwNEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":100620,"nextInTopic":100627,"prevInTime":100622,"nextInTime":100624,"topicId":100620,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**He asked for lessons after watching a kid on tv.

We have gone to some classes at the zoo or science museum, but these are the first ones where he has gone in alone without me participating with him.  He asked for lessons after watching a kid on tv.  His first comment after walking out was &quot;These teachers were telling me what to do.  I sure didn&#39;t expect that.  You know how much I hate being told what to do.&quot;  But, he wants to go back.  He seems to like it fine, he said it wasn&#39;t what he expected and he wasn&#39;t able to do the tricks right away that the kid on tv did.  But, he wants to continue.  Everyone is telling me how good it is for him to have someone else tell him what to do instead of just me.  &quot;All kids need to learn that.&quot;  whatever, I don&#39;t think so.  He can take the class as long as he wants to.  We go to science class in the park, but that&#39;s basically a guy that brings animals and the kids go on nature hikes, very very informal.  He doesn&#39;t really like structured classes.  As I watch him, the more I&#39;m confident we are doing the best for him by keeping him out of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do see a friend of mine who&#39;s daughter is in piano at 4.  She has to force her to practice everyday.  She just started and she&#39;s already forcing her to do it.  Ugh, it seems so obvious that this is the best way for her to hate piano.<br/>\nLaura J<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100622,"nextTopicId":100626}}
