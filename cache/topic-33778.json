I&#39;ve been in contact with a number<br/>\nof friends both on-line and IRL and I&#39;ve spent a lot of time talking<br/>\nwith my dearest friend of all, my husband.  The conclusion that I<br/>\nreached is that I cannot be an owner of this list now.  In fact I<br/>\nwill no longer be a member of this list.  The reasons that drew me<br/>\nhere in June, 1999 no longer exist for me.  Just so no one feels<br/>\nlike I am singling out this list - I&#39;m leaving a lot of others too.<br/>\nI&#39;ve unsubbed from 18 lists in the past 24 hours and I have a few<br/>\nmore to go...  (I guess my Flylady 27 Fling Boogie will be email<br/>\nlists this week.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish all of you well in your unschooling journey.  It&#39;s very likely<br/>\nI&#39;ll see you around the Internet in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood-bye and good luck whereever your journey takes you, <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33776,"nextTopicId":33762}}
