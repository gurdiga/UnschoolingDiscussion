Was he actually<br/>\nfinding peace in eating? Now that he has a choice, does he eat more<br/>\nnutritious foods only when he is hungry? I ask, because my daughter seems<br/>\nto be a muncher. She wants to eat all day long, but won&#39;t really eat much<br/>\nat a sit down meal.

A box of raisins for the 5 minute car ride, crackers while<br/>\nwatching a tape, granola bar while she is painting, etc.etc. I&#39;ll will<br/>\nask her if she is hungry and she will tell me no. It is like she is<br/>\nmunching for the sake of munching. I don&#39;t want her to start bad habits<br/>\nshe will have problems braking later, but I don&#39;t want to deprive her<br/>\neither.

Some families just have large people in them no matter how they <br/>\neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really have no one on my families side that is heavy.

They are always dieting and always big. As in fat big. <br/>\nOnce I got away from her dad, I let her eat the way she wanted to. Her <br/>\nsister, (me ex step daughter who I am very close to) is very overweight and <br/>\nstill has issues now at age 28. Tara was away from her dad and with my <br/>\nhusband now from age 4 on. She is not overweight at all. I don&#39;t worry about <br/>\nher getting that way and she doesn&#39;t diet, although she&#39;ll have the same <br/>\nanxiety pains every once in awhile that most 17 year old girls have like, <br/>\n&quot;does my stomach look fat in this outfit?&quot; She&#39;s a lot better now than she <br/>\nwas even a year ago. The Oprah show helped that a lot and she is pretty well <br/>\npleased with herself now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur other 3 children are not even looking like I have to worry about weight. <br/>\nMy 8 yr old Joseph is downright skinny. Of course pictures of me at that age <br/>\nshow the same incredibly skinny legs!!! The two younger girls are not big at <br/>\nall. The kids all wear sizes of their ages and most a year younger even.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although there is potential there for them to possibly have a problem, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t worry or see it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

I do, on occasion say; okay to the<br/>\ncookies, but then something nutritional, if they&#39;ve been going at cookies<br/>\nand candies a lot over a set period of time, but most of the time, they ask<br/>\nfor something, and if we have it they get it.  My worry is actually the<br/>\nopposite; mine are all on the small side.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFWIW, most of the children who I see who are overweight are from the<br/>\nregulated, clean your plate, dessert after more nutritional food (one mom<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t let her child have more blueberries until she had more veggies or<br/>\nchicken, can&#39;t remember which. Because blueberries were sweet and she wanted<br/>\nher to not be so use to sweet tastes.)  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI look at it this way; if you have a cookie and a sandwich, you are getting<br/>\nthe cookies from both.  If all you want is a cookie, that is all the<br/>\ncalories you are going to get.  What eating a good meal before dessert does<br/>\nis train the body to eat more than it is hungry for in order to satiate the<br/>\ntaste buds. If you satisfy both your physical/emotional and sensory needs<br/>\nwith one thing, then you are not adding more food into your body than you<br/>\nwant.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nbe well,\r<br/>\nRachel Ann\r<br/>\nmom to one sick little girl (Tehila, my 3.5 threw up 3x---last time on<br/>\nbreast milk) so if I&#39;m rambling that is why...well, that is what I&#39;m saying<br/>\nis why,  it may or may not really be true.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today\r<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!\r<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I chose peanut M&Ms for my substitute for smoking last year.  It took about 6 months of binging(and about 20 lbs.) for me to quit craving them (or cigarettes).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was one of those kids who was severely (imo) restricted regarding junk food.  We could not have sugary cereals (always had to be Cheerios, Rice Crispies, Chex), no kind of Little Debbie&#39;s or snacky cake type stuff, pretzels--no chips, and we couldn&#39;t even chew gum.  I remember vividly when I was about 10 or 11 going through my mother&#39;s old discarded purses for any forgotten sugar free gum that she might have had stashed for herself (she didn&#39;t share either).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs soon as I was old enough to walk to the store, my main allowance expenses were 1 large bag of Doritoes, 1 box of Little Debbie&#39;s (Swiss Cake Rolls is my all time fav.), and a 45 RPM record.  I would go to my room, listen to my new music and eat, and eat, and eat.  I felt like I was really getting away with something.  My mother didn&#39;t know about it or she probably would have found a way to stop my indulgences.  I ended up gaining about 30 lbs. in Jr. High School due to this bad habit.  I still haven&#39;t conquered this need to &#39;treat&#39; myself whenever I want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I have a friend who was allowed all kinds of junk to eat and she ended up gaining a lot of weight too........so I guess poor eating habits happen for different reasons for different people but for me it was definitely the restriction that led to the bingeing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor my kids, I try so hard to model good eating behaviors but it&#39;s still hard not to want to eat crap all the time.  They are allowed pretty much whatever they want but I have always limited quantities.  Such as, only 1 snack cake a day, 1 soda a day, chips only with a sandwich (or a meal) instead of allowing them to snack on them at will.  I have even relaxed these &#39;rules&#39;( maybe about 4-5 months ago) and I have already noticed a difference in their eating.  My daughter biggest request from the store this week was canned spinach (yuck!).  My son&#39;s was celery.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Need help unschooling food...","postDate":"1042565607","msgId":54935,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNy4xZDlkYzgxNi4yYjU1YTNlN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54931,"nextInTopic":54939,"prevInTime":54934,"nextInTime":54936,"topicId":54834,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/14/03 11:30:40 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

My 2 girls<br/>\nwill pretty much eat any fruits or vegetables that they grow and pick. So<br/>\nduring the summer time they eat plenty of strawberries, blackberries,<br/>\npeaches, cherries, pears, apples, and a variety of garden vegetables.<br/>\nThey are not all too interested in junk food, and I don&#39;t bake that much<br/>\nin the summertime. The winter time is a different story. They will eat<br/>\nsome store bought fruits and veggies, but only if they are fresh, ie: no<br/>\ncanned or frozen. They don&#39;t even care for the fruits or veggies that we<br/>\ncanned ourselves. But they do tend to fill up on junk food all winter. I<br/>\ntry to buy junk food of the healthful sorts, with no artificial colors or<br/>\nflavors, no MSG, low fat, low amount of refined sugar, and do bake a lot.<br/>\nAnd herein lies the problem. The oldest is starting to get pretty chunky.<br/>\nIt may be just a stage thing (she&#39;s 5), but I don&#39;t want it to become a<br/>\nhealth problem. I was wondering, do all of you who let your children eat<br/>\nwhatever they want have concerns for their childrens&#39; weight? And I am<br/>\nnot talking from a societal view, but a health view. I know that lack of<br/>\nexercise during the winter months is also a contributing factor, and I<br/>\nhave seen some of the weight come off during the summer months, but never<br/>\nthe same amount that was put on. Is this something I should be concerned<br/>\nabout? How do you all handle the unhealthy aspect of allowing your<br/>\nchildren to eat whatever they want?<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Need help unschooling food...","postDate":"1042561703","msgId":54912,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5My4xM2ZhYjMwNS4yYjU1OTRhN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54911,"nextInTopic":54931,"prevInTime":54911,"nextInTime":54913,"topicId":54834,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/14/2003 10:48:14 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...

But buy four pounds, and keep <br/>\nrefilling the bowl, and they&#39;ll probably get tired of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalloween is one of the best tests for people wanting to stop being the <br/>\nfood-controllers for their kids.  If kids eat two candies a day, or whatever, <br/>\nthey can manage to eat every bit of it, even stuff they don&#39;t like.  If they <br/>\ntry to eat it all at once, lots will end up in the trash or they&#39;ll get to <br/>\nthe point that they don&#39;t want to see it for the rest of the week, or year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have an advantage, having done this way always (thanks in part to an <br/>\narticle in Mothering Magazine many years ago, and because my husband binges <br/>\nand I didn&#39;t want to do anything against which a binge would be reactionary, <br/>\nhoping to help the kids avoid that).   It has been many years since any child <br/>\nhere finished holiday candy (Christmas, Easter, Halloween) before the next <br/>\nholiday rolled around.  Often they end up throwing their stash away because <br/>\nthe outsides of the wrappers are getting dusty (New Mexico does that) and <br/>\nthey already have new candy from the last holiday, in a box lid or bowl <br/>\nsomewhere in their room.  We never make a big deal about it one way or <br/>\nanother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby takes Red Vines with him to the anime convention he goes to.  He took <br/>\ntwo of the plastic buckets (from costco) of 200 or however many last year, <br/>\nand they were gone in one day (he gives them out to anyone who comes and <br/>\nasks).  Last year and this he&#39;s signed up to have his convention badge say <br/>\n&quot;Licorice Boy.&quot;  So if any of you are at Nan Desu Kan in Denver this fall, <br/>\nlook for him.  He&#39;ll probably take three or four buckets this year.   When he <br/>\nhas an of that in his room at home, he&#39;ll eat one or two a day, if he <br/>\nremembers, and it will get hard before it gets gone.  Unless he has a lot of <br/>\ncompany.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need help unschooling food...","postDate":"1042558037","msgId":54897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3LjE2ODA2ZWVmLjJiNTU4NjU1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":54895,"nextInTopic":54900,"prevInTime":54896,"nextInTime":54898,"topicId":54834,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We make homemade cookies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not manaichal about it.

It has been about 3 months since we stopped limiting Jason&#39;s (6 yo) <br/>\njunk food. I want to say<br/>\nup front that I have not given up...I do believe that this will work. But I <br/>\nreally could<br/>\nuse some advice here. I honestly felt pretty good about giving up this <br/>\nrestriction...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell 3 months isn&#39;t a really long time and you have admitted to some outward <br/>\nbehavior that goes against totally letting go. So in essence it hasn&#39;t even <br/>\nbeen a total 3 months of total non restriction. Depending on the child and <br/>\nthe parent, it will take awhile for things to even out. And even then, some <br/>\nkids are totally erratic anyway. My kids have such swings in their eating <br/>\nhabits it would drive me crazy if I worried. Some say to look at the week <br/>\nand it will balance. Sometimes I would probably have to do it by months with <br/>\nmy kids!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNext thing is to maybe not have so much &quot;junk&quot; food available. Just because <br/>\nyou don&#39;t want to restrict doesn&#39;t mean you have to have tons of junk <br/>\navailable all the time. If you run out, say so and offer what else you have <br/>\navailable. If your child asks for more to be replaced, you can promise to <br/>\nget it the next time you go shopping. I also find what works well with my <br/>\nkids is to just put certain foods out and if it&#39;s there, they will eat it. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t do this as a trick but more as conveniece for me if I have things to <br/>\ndo and would like the flow not to ber broken with getting 3 kids 3 different <br/>\nfoods and 3 different times. I&#39;ll put out a bowl or plate of whatever and <br/>\nmost of the time, someone eats most of what&#39;s there. You can do that with <br/>\nfruit or whatever you like. Kids love finger foods and my kids love to dip <br/>\nstuff. Their dip of choice is creamy white, which is ranch dressing. They <br/>\nput it on stuff I can&#39;t even stomach to think about. Not sure where it came <br/>\nfrom as I hate the stuff!!!! They also like cheese dip and recently salsa. <br/>\nMy kids also like to eat things with toothpicks. I buy the fancy colored <br/>\nplastic ones and they love that too. Make it fun and different. Cut shapes <br/>\nand offer little bowls of different things.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust hang in there, which it seems like you want to do anyway and it will <br/>\nwork out fine. Good luck with being patient!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE* <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi &lt;bunsofaluminum60@hotmail.com&gt;","from":"&quot;Heidi &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Need help unschooling food...","postDate":"1042523414","msgId":54851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGIwMDhlbSs3aTRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDEzREM4NzFAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54848,"nextInTopic":54855,"prevInTime":54850,"nextInTime":54852,"topicId":54834,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How about...filling the fridge with those fruits you mentioned?

Don&#39;t have the <br/>\njunkfood as part of the staples of your pantry and fridge. Bring them <br/>\nout for special occasions, even have a special occasion once a day! <br/>\nLet him eat as much of what you provide, as he wants, and provide <br/>\nwholesome stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, Heidi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; <br/>\n&lt;stephanie.elms@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OK.
