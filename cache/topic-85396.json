So <br/>\nthis may be or may not be a disappointing XMAS.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to keep in mind is that by altering the way you are handling <br/>\nthis day you are altering tradition. I&#39;m not talking about a social <br/>\ntradition but what is considered a tradition in your family. So I think <br/>\nwhat you might need to take into consideration is tradition. What kinds <br/>\nof new traditions can you think up? Since you are ready to give up the <br/>\nsuspense, in what other way can you bring it into the day? Is this <br/>\nsomething you think your family would be into?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, no matter what they may be in for a downer. Change can do that to <br/>\nya. The thing to remember is that change and the disappointment that <br/>\nmight come with it are OK. When you boiled it down to the bone, a <br/>\ntradition is a practice. When you  start a new practice, just as any <br/>\nnewbie, you will have more misses than hits. But as the cliche goes, <br/>\npractice makes perfect. This may not be a perfect XMAS but maybe next <br/>\nyear will.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, this whole deschooling / unschooling experience has been rife <br/>\nwith ups and downs for my husband and I. Our kids? Not at all. They <br/>\ntake our cues from us. Like with the patience thing. Thing1 (Evan) is <br/>\nthe NOW guy, way more than the little one who is 3 1/2. Of course, used <br/>\nto drive me up the wall until after being here for a while and going <br/>\nback to yoga, I got that patience is not just a quality one is born <br/>\nwith, it&#39;s a skill one develops with practice. So every time he gets <br/>\ntesty because it is not NOW, I remind him (and myself) that what he <br/>\nneeds is to practice patience. He&#39;s into sports and is learning guitar <br/>\nso he understands how much better he gets at things after practicing. <br/>\nHe hates to hear and yet he smiles because he now takes it as a <br/>\nchallenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe you guys may want to take this XMAS as a &quot;practice run&quot; for <br/>\nnext year. I know, it sounds utterly moronic but that&#39;s the point. If <br/>\nyou are doing something completely different might as well go all the <br/>\nway in the silly department --- a good does of levity might be just <br/>\nwhat you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: xmas presents dilemma","postDate":"1069894298","msgId":85413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzExMjYxNjQ5NTUuMDI1OWJiZDBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGJxM2EwbSsxNmMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzExMjYxMzE1MDUuMDI1OGYzZTBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4gPGJxM2EwbSsxNmMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":85412,"nextInTopic":85416,"prevInTime":85412,"nextInTime":85414,"topicId":85396,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
