I have been trying all night to get caught up<br/>\nand have not quite gotten there yet. But I wanted to jump <br/>\nin really quick and give some of my impressions as an &quot;older&quot;<br/>\nnewbie (LOL! is there such a thing? I have been reading here<br/>\nfor a little over 8 months now I guess).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically when I first joined, I loved hearing the ideas, most <br/>\nspoke to what I believed in my heart. But they seemed scary. So I<br/>\nread. And listened to lots of discussions like these (which to<br/>\nbe honest with you I have learned lots from). I definitely got<br/>\ndefensive from time as things that I did were pointed out as<br/>\nbeing controlling (restricting tv, sweets, etc). After all I <br/>\nwas one of the most relaxed/non-controlling moms I knew...I<br/>\nwas definitely not controlling! But then I realized that no<br/>\none was saying that I was a bad mom...just that by restricting<br/>\nmy kids in these ways I was being controlling. I became less<br/>\ndefensive and decided that I was comfortable with the few<br/>\nrestrictions that I had. I kept reading and more and more<br/>\nI started getting *un*comfortable with these restrictions. So<br/>\nI started lifting them.  I still did not completely get it<br/>\nand hit some bumps here and there (with me and my comfort level).<br/>\nI posted a little but was definitely worried about the responses<br/>\nI might get. Maybe because I knew that I did not get it<br/>\ncompletely. I got some good advice and had a few &quot;aha&quot; moments<br/>\nand went back to reading. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I found is that even if I did not have the <br/>\ncourage to post, I still learned from reading what everyone<br/>\nelse was posting. Usually there would be a discussion about<br/>\nmy concerns at sometime or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I feel like I would have the courage to post and I think <br/>\nthat is because I have seen wonderful answers to posts that <br/>\nare genuinely looking for help to get past their fears. And that<br/>\nis where I am. :o) The key is to keep from getting defensive...<br/>\nhard to do sometimes when you are talking about your own <br/>\nparenting and kids. But I do believe that no one here makes it<br/>\npersonal. It is about the ideas, not the person.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents...<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63229,"nextTopicId":18430}}
