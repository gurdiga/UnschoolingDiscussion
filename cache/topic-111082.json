I was responding to similar kinds of peer pressure.  The difference for me was I&#39;m a spender at heart so I would go ahead and buy it anyway much of the time and then beat myself up for it.  Another thing I used to do is I would say to my kids since I bought you this..then you need to do that..fill in the this /that with toy/some chore.  In my mind then I could justify that they somehow &#39;earned&#39; it.  Such crap!

But then I also realize what a blessing my kids&#39; outgrown stuff has been to other people, so it is truly out of abundance that we can share with others I think.<br/>\n  It is just so great to hear about other moms that ENJOY buying stuff for their kids.

This is a conversation my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-331101056\">One thing that has started to shift for me since thinking about  <br/>\nunschooling is the idea that all our kids have &quot;too many&quot; toys. This  <br/>\nis a conversation my friends have all the time, how our kids have so  <br/>\nmany toys, so many more than we had, it&#39;s like they just proliferate,  <br/>\nwhat can be done? Even six months ago, I was saying, &quot;The only thing  <br/>\nI&#39;d do differently as a mother is be more selective about which toys,  <br/>\nand how many, I let into the house.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started reading these lists, and a few things started to get  <br/>\nclear for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I realized I was parroting the &quot;too many toys&quot; mantra without  <br/>\nreally thinking about it. It&#39;s what all my lefty, organic-food- <br/>\neating, Birkie-wearing friends say. Also, we&#39;re Quakers, so there&#39;s  <br/>\nthe whole burden of the Testimony of Simplicity hanging over our  <br/>\nheads. So I was walking around saying, &quot;Too many toys! Too many  <br/>\ntoys!&quot; without ever thinking about what &quot;too many&quot; might really mean  <br/>\nor why I thought there were too many (just because there are more  <br/>\nthan I had? Wrong answer! I want my kids to have lots more of lots of  <br/>\nthings than I had in my childhood!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I realized that I had always had this other voice of regret  <br/>\nin my head...like, I would see something and think, &quot;it would be so  <br/>\ncool to get that for Eric...but he already has too many toys.&quot; I felt  <br/>\nthis cognitive dissonance because there were so many things I thought  <br/>\nwould be valuable and interesting for him that we didn&#39;t have, but I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think we could get because I thought we had too much stuff  <br/>\nalready.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, I visited my friend down the street one day. This is a woman  <br/>\nwho owns so much stuff it scares me--her daughter has no fewer than  <br/>\nsix different winter coats, which would be too much for me--I&#39;m not  <br/>\ncapable of dealing with having to decide every day which coat my kid  <br/>\nis going to wear! But she loves buying cute things for her daughter,  <br/>\nand making those choices is pleasurable for them both. When I first  <br/>\nmet this friend, her daughter (an only child at that time) had so  <br/>\nmany toys, and so many that seemed like duplicates to me (like five  <br/>\ndifferent ride-on toys) that I wondered if she had been thinking of  <br/>\nopening a day care!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I dropped by one day and her 4-year-old had set up a whole  <br/>\nFisher Price Little People village and was playing with it. Which  <br/>\nreminded me of...<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, I remembered that when I was a kid, I never had enough of  <br/>\nanything to do anything cool. Like, I&#39;d get a Legos starter set...and  <br/>\nthen never any more Legos. So I could never build anything cool. If  <br/>\nmy friend&#39;s daughter had been me, she would have gotten one Little  <br/>\nPeople set...period. And I thought about how rotten that felt to me  <br/>\nas a kid. How much I would have liked to have a whole village of  <br/>\nLittle People, or so many Legos I could build a castle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI no longer think we have &quot;too many&quot; toys. And I feel free to buy  <br/>\nsomething new for the kids if I think they&#39;d enjoy it. It&#39;s much more  <br/>\npleasant than looking at my kids&#39; toy shelves and feeling sour  <br/>\nbecause they have so much stuff by some arbitrary standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 8, 2006, at 1:28 PM, Wendy S. wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for sharing this.
