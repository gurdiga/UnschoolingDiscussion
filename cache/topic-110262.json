They weren&#39;t constantly bombarded with all kinds  of <br/>\nstimulation and activity that they weren&#39;t used to (no matter how normal or  <br/>\nexemplary we think it is).  <br/>\n <br/>\nEVERYONE got a break and we were able to come together for meals or other  <br/>\nactivities that made things much more pleasant for everyone.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also found that IF you aren&#39;t actually &quot;living&quot; in their house but merely  <br/>\nthere for one activity or the other (such as a shared meal or visiting time)  <br/>\ngrandparents are way less likely to feel they can demand certain things from <br/>\nthe  children.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat won&#39;t solve all the worlds ill tempered grandparents and just  downright <br/>\nthink they know best ones either, but it will help to make things a  bit more <br/>\npeaceful and the children almost always have a much much better  time.  <br/>\nHotels are an adventure all in themselves, so having to &quot;put up with  the old <br/>\npeople&quot; if that&#39;s how it is, seems much better in a lot of ways.<br/>\n <br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109668,"nextTopicId":110258}}
