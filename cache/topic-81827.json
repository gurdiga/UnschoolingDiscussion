Suddenly, everything fell apart and I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow where to turn. The AP advice just didn&#39;t work anymore - then I found this <br/>\nbook! Though I didn&#39;t agree on every point, the basic philosophy makes sense <br/>\n- and works! It&#39;s a breath of fresh air not to be at the mercy of my 30 month <br/>\nold any more. Rosemond gives moms permission to take charge, to teach and <br/>\ndiscipline their children.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a book review of <br/>\nA Family Of Value<br/>\nby John Rosemond<br/>\nAverage Customer Review:  <br/>\nMass Market Paperback (October, 1995)<br/>\nlist price: US$12.95 -- our price: US$10.36 <br/>\n(price subject to change: see help)<br/>\nCanada | United Kingdom | Germany | France<br/>\n<br/>\nSame page, negative review of a book on Christian unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Take, for instance, a case appropriate for the Christian audience. A child <br/>\nmight love the great heroes of the Bible, earnestly researching their lives <br/>\nand tales, while at the same time showing no desire to ever understand or pursue <br/>\ndoctrinal knowledge. Certainly no parent would want that to continue. The <br/>\nhole in the unschooling model is that there are few ways of remedying this lack <br/>\nwithout moving outside of unschooling. Therefore, as a philosophy unto itself, <br/>\nit fails. Other examples that find the chinks in the armor abound.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gggg.com/best/books/372QPTZA3895G.html\">http://www.gggg.com/best/books/372QPTZA3895G.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81822,"nextTopicId":81828}}
