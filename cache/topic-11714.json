Have you<br/>\nread  &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;.??.. your girls might be ready  to<br/>\nread that for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read it twice and now I gave it to my 11 year old to read so he can<br/>\nunderstand the unschooling way better--in terms of options and ideas.   .<br/>\nWe have always been child-led but for my kid...he needs some direction.<br/>\nThis year since he is technically doing upper middle school /high school<br/>\nlevel work , I told him we would be more hands-off.  It will be more<br/>\ndirected my him as to what he wants to study.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach year I have him sit down and do a list of things he might want to<br/>\ninvestigate or study..... we don&#39;t stick to it but its a starting point.<br/>\nWhen we run out of ideas or get bored we try to remember what was on the<br/>\nlist to see if its sounds interesting or not and go from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime,,, we just &quot;live&quot;  !!!!.  Between activities, the dog, the<br/>\nhouse, the shopping, the meal prep,visiting our friends, volunteer work,<br/>\nthe laundry, field trips and our huge appetite for books and  going to the<br/>\nlibrary....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been mostly &quot;unschoolers&quot; for years but have in just the past few<br/>\nyears gone to a more text approach for math only.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time to come up with your own family&#39;s rhythm.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\nJeanne in Wisconsin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11693,"nextTopicId":11715}}
