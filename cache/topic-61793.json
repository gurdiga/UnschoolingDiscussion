(mixed age class goes up to about age 12)  They never<br/>\npaid attention, they wound everyone up, they were mouthy and rude.  It<br/>\nwas just another place there parents dumped them to get rid of them for<br/>\nawhile.

I made it through<br/>\nthe rest of that year, but didn&#39;t go back.  <br/>\n <br/>\nRecently, the kids wanted to go try it out again.  (They wanted to go do<br/>\na craft with the other kids.)  So, off we went. (my kids like me to stay<br/>\nin class with them.)   It seems the class is now being taught (at least<br/>\nthe week we were there, they rotate weeks) by a ps teacher.  It was so<br/>\nawful!  There were worksheets and a condescending tone. The one thing<br/>\nshe was good at though, was keeping the kids who obviously didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto be there, in line.  She even threatened one little boy with a time<br/>\nout.  The whole experience was awful.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt the end of the the class, she said she heard I was homeschooling and<br/>\nwanted to know if I taught based on the Maine Learning Results.  (not<br/>\nsure how she worded it)  I misunderstood her to be asking if I would be<br/>\nmaking my kids take the MEA (Maine assessment test.)  I told her no, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t test and we don&#39;t teach to the test.  We follow the children&#39;s<br/>\nlead.  I could see the gears going.  Se explained how the learning<br/>\nresults show where Mainer children are weak in certain areas and how if<br/>\nwe focus on those points, we can do better on the Maine Assessment Test.<br/>\nLike, how would that apply  to us?<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, that was a little glimpse into public school and it was enough for<br/>\nme.

Luckily for me, it was a 3/4 class, so I got them both in <br/>\nwithout a fight and stayed with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep one was everyone sit down on your mat with your legs folded. Do not <br/>\nspeak until recognized (this is before the CLASS started). I was not <br/>\nsurprised to hear that the TEACHER was also a preschool TEACHER the rest <br/>\nof the week, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story is told and played out with little wooden characters. Then the <br/>\nkids have a few minutes to choose a free-choice activity (Brian&#39;s? draw <br/>\na train! big surprise there!) Then they re-form in their circle on mats, <br/>\nwith legs folded (very important) to have snack/fake communion. Then as <br/>\nparents arrive to pick up kids each may get up when their name is called <br/>\nand get a sticker, their art, and go. There is no minute allowed for <br/>\nconversation at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBLEAH!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey wanted to go back this week, and did, but I haven&#39;t had the heart <br/>\nto ask if they&#39;re planning to do so again. BLEAH!<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61802,"nextTopicId":61882}}
