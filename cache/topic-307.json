My unschooler friend<br/>\nDawn goes to lots of stuff like dance, 4-H, etc. and loves it. However I<br/>\nhave another friends (homeschooled the veeeeery structured way) who&#39;s mother<br/>\nmakes her do all these activities to keep her busy -- that&#39;s why I never see<br/>\nher anymore! :-( Activities are probably a good thing except when the parent<br/>\ngoes in overdrive, trying to make the child/teen do everything :} I&#39;d say to<br/>\nyou not to worry, though. :) ~Eryn<br/>\n<br/>\n==<br/>\n&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>\nthen I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>\nbeing a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>\na man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/\">http://www.camenaworks.com/Eryn/</a><br/>\n#24591173  ::she just is::<br/>\nAIM ::  Opal Fayre</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"mainmom@xxxxx.xxx","from":"mainmom@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"V8f8u-hO5RZWmX_Sfz5fKg1lANKG3nh7AeoDjZdFijKxAb5ED68OrVdpa1lGaPPFHMq8G41i0NE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Socialization","postDate":"928433631","msgId":309,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40NC4zMDkuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":307,"nextInTopic":317,"prevInTime":308,"nextInTime":310,"topicId":307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think the social schedule depends on the child.

It doesn&#39;t matter if<br/>\nthey&#39;re in school or not. I think the child should really love and want<br/>\nto do what they are doing. I&#39;ve seen my own SIL who has kids in school<br/>\nmake them take a sport or music lesson because she feels like they<br/>\nshould have something to do. I&#39;ve seen many parents do this to their<br/>\nchildren and yes some of them are homeschoolers. Maybe they are trying<br/>\nto &quot;make up&quot; for something they feel is missing. I have also seen kids<br/>\nthat really want to do a lot and they have something going on every<br/>\nnight of the week. IMO, that&#39;s too much, even though they enjoy it. I<br/>\nthink following the child is the key and then moderation. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary in FL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kim","from":"&quot;Kim&quot; &lt;cook4you@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"c0kjEEEYz0z1DOLrG5ZgZdgdoXMQyCNqz83ynafydvEQ-uBcWmA7TAO_EtPnIrFniFN1QbVd83dVB245uN_y","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Socialization","postDate":"928431601","msgId":307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40NC4zMDcuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":309,"prevInTime":306,"nextInTime":308,"topicId":307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone think that maybe we are overcompensating for what non-home schoolers perceive as lack of socialization?
