He comes with &quot;the chair, wired helmet,<br/>\n&gt; floorboards<br/>\n&gt; and electrocuting switch.&quot; For $23.95, you, too, can<br/>\n&gt; purchase<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;deluxe box set&quot; and share the cheap thrill of<br/>\n&gt; executing a<br/>\n&gt; murderer: &quot;Feel the burn as the electric buzz fills the<br/>\n&gt; room and<br/>\n&gt; he starts to shake and convulse,&quot; an ad promotion for<br/>\n&gt; Death Row<br/>\n&gt; Marv beckons. &quot;Experience the pain as the shaking<br/>\n&gt; continues and<br/>\n&gt; his eyes start to glow bright red.
