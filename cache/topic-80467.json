So is it my &quot;social responsibility&quot; <br/>\n&gt;to not do anything around anybody else that might irritate them?  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s your responsibility to avoid doing irritating things &quot;in-your-face&quot; <br/>\nto people you should know it will annoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I believe in extended breastfeeding, is it my social <br/>\n&gt;responsibility to not breastfeed in public or around other people <br/>\n&gt;because it might bother them?  No, my child needs to be fed when they <br/>\n&gt;are hungry, and I am going to honor that need no matter where I am.  <br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t care if others are bothered.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s rude to flop it out in public--breastfeeding discretely is pretty <br/>\nreasonable most places. Even so, there are times and places that most <br/>\nsensitive people could predict it would be best avoided if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I believe in not immunizing my children, does that mean I should <br/>\n&gt;keep them away from all other children because some parents may <br/>\n&gt;believe mine will infect theirs?  No, I won&#39;t do that.  They are <br/>\n&gt;misinformed, my child is actually more in danger of being infected <br/>\n&gt;from theirs than they are from mine.  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t send them out in t-shirts that advertise their immunity <br/>\nstatus. The point is not that you should live your life for others, just <br/>\nthat discretion is often a good plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I believe in unschooling, and parents object to my kids talking to <br/>\n&gt;theirs because it might give their kids ideas about quitting school, <br/>\n&gt;am I going to tell my kids they can&#39;t talk to the other ones if they <br/>\n&gt;see them in the neighborhood?  No, my kids can talk to whoever they <br/>\n&gt;want to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;re not talking about *can* but should. If your kids have consistently <br/>\nhad a problem bringing up unschooling with certain friends, they might <br/>\nwant to learn to talk about other things instead. It&#39;s about tact, not <br/>\nrubbing people&#39;s noses in things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Because I don&#39;t teach my kids that drinking, cussing, dancing and sex <br/>\n&gt;are wrong, some parents don&#39;t like their kids to be around mine, <br/>\n&gt;because they might get bad &quot;ideas.&quot;  So, it is socially responsible <br/>\n&gt;for me to make sure that my kids aren&#39;t around anyone that might be <br/>\n&gt;offended by our beliefs?  No, that&#39;s not my responsibility.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But it *is* your responsibility to let your kids know that some people <br/>\nare offended by those things, and that by doing those things around <br/>\ncertain people/groups, they may limit their options.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may not agree, but I do think it&#39;s my responsibility as a mom to <br/>\nmodel socially responsible behavior, including removing my child from a <br/>\nsituation where they&#39;re screaming or hitting others. I want my kids to <br/>\nhave the option to hang around others, not to be excluded from groups <br/>\nbecause they feel they have a &quot;right&quot; to cuss where it&#39;s not OK or keep <br/>\ndoing things others find objectionable.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-) Diane</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143396710,"authorName":"Dawn Blum","from":"&quot;Dawn Blum&quot; &lt;dawnblum@...&gt;","profile":"dawnblum2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Anime and Manga fans","postDate":"1063679410","msgId":80556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2IwMWMzN2JmYSQ3NDNhYjFmMCQ2NjAxYThjMEBOT1RFQk9PSz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJCOEI0RkQ3LjFFNjlDJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":80554,"nextInTopic":80573,"prevInTime":80555,"nextInTime":80557,"topicId":80467,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hehe I saw it today at diamond shamrock so it is pretty available..

The School Chaplain has an article in each<br/>\nnewsletter and in this issue she dealt with the Golden Rule. Her<br/>\nresearch revealed that Jesus in the New Testament is the only religious<br/>\nor spiritual leader to express it just this way as above. All the other<br/>\nreligious traditions express it thus: Do NOT do unto others what you<br/>\nwould NOT like to be done to you. The Chaplain unsurprisingly preferred<br/>\nthe Christian interpretation. However I am not so sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal problem with the Golden Rule is that it would set me up as<br/>\nthe arbiter of what other people want - and expects me to be a mind<br/>\nreader to boot. Suppose that I would want someone to come up and hug me<br/>\nwhen I am upset, but the other person desperately prefers to be left in<br/>\nsolitude to think, cry or perhaps pray when they are bothered by<br/>\nsomething. My responding to them with what I would want is likely to<br/>\ncreate even more misunderstanding. I wish I could have the expectation<br/>\nthat everyone could simply say clearly, &quot;I need thus and such right now<br/>\nfrom you&quot;, without rancour. However I don&#39;t think that is likely even if<br/>\nit is desirable. Another saying springs to mind. &quot;The Road to Hell is<br/>\nPaved With Good Intentions&quot;. I think it could be better to ask other<br/>\npeople what they need from me. Gee I Hope I remember to implement that<br/>\nsound notion here at home!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also prefer the Witch&#39;s Rede as mentioned by another Pagan. &quot;An it<br/>\nHarm None, Do What You Will&quot;.

No, my kids can talk to whoever they <br/>\nwant to.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan they say whatever they want to without regard to the personal or social <br/>\nconsequences?   I talk about unschooling most of the time.  I don&#39;t when I&#39;m <br/>\nwith someone I KNOW has to work, who has relatives (especially stepchildren) <br/>\nthey can&#39;t even begin to consider homeschooing, let alone unschooling.   If they <br/>\nwant information it&#39;s there.  If they ask about my kids, I tell them stories.  <br/>\nBut even my kids know when their freedom isn&#39;t the most polite topic of <br/>\nconversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Because I don&#39;t teach my kids that drinking, cussing, dancing and sex <br/>\nare wrong, some parents don&#39;t like their kids to be around mine, <br/>\nbecause they might get bad &quot;ideas.&quot;  So, it is socially responsible <br/>\nfor me to make sure that my kids aren&#39;t around anyone that might be <br/>\noffended by our beliefs?

It&#39;s not my job to keep my kids away from them because <br/>\nthe way I am raising them makes somebody uncomfortable. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDepends where the people are.  Are they in their own home?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, if one of my kids is walking around singing songs from the <br/>\nSouth Park movie, nobody in the family cares.  If we have company, they&#39;re not <br/>\nlikely to do it.  If they&#39;re visiting Christian friends, they definitely won&#39;t <br/>\nburst into &quot;Step one, &#39;stead of ass say buns, like kiss my buns or you&#39;re a buns <br/>\nhole.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sin.<br/>\nI do think there are times and places, and if a child is told that he can say <br/>\nfuck anywhere he wants to and to anyone he wants, that&#39;s a great disservice, <br/>\nand when he&#39;s grown he could have legal problems with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s the <br/>\nresponsibility of parents of difficult kids to apologize for their <br/>\nbehavior or to make sure they aren&#39;t disrupting anybody&#39;s lives.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had unschooling get-togethers for years.  Often they were at our house.  <br/>\nOne family could (and a couple did) keep others from returning to the group.  <br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t cool for their kids or mine, or the other families who no longer <br/>\nfelt comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a park, I could move away from them.  When it was my house, I could ask <br/>\nthem to leave or let them stay and disturb the peace of others who were there.  <br/>\nUsually I just dealt directly with the child and bypassed the mom if the mom <br/>\nwasn&#39;t interested in keeping the peace of others.

With true &#39;nastiness&#39; I step in immediately <br/>\nand tell them that its not acceptable (I&#39;m not talking sibling bickering <br/>\nbut when it gets nasty). I aslo talk to them afterwards. With &#39;rage&#39; I <br/>\ndo leave the park/house or wherever I am cos I am embaressed and <br/>\nstressed and afraid of bothering other people. When the child has <br/>\nemerged from the other side we talk and on the whole the child is <br/>\nactually more sorry for the &#39;rage&#39; than for being nasty to a sibling.<br/>\nMy mother advocates spanking for both cases. She says a child should be <br/>\nbroken and is unconcerned that the apparent good behaviour is through <br/>\nfear. Despite this attitude and many beatings she managed to control the <br/>\nevery day behaviour of my brother and me but not our &#39;rages&#39; They are <br/>\ngenerally as uncontrollable as depression or anorexia or autism. My <br/>\nbrother and I both left home at 16, the day we were legally able too.<br/>\nMy Unschooling and TCS philosophy doesn&#39;t allow me to take the <br/>\n&#39;beatings&#39; path or to humiliate or shame the child in order to break <br/>\nthem however easy it would be and to be honest &#39;abusive&#39; behaviour is <br/>\nrare. I can&#39;t recall a time when any of them said something nasty to me <br/>\nout of nastiness or meaness. It is the uncontrollable rages the child <br/>\nexperiences where neither beatings nor TCS seem to help (not that I&#39;ve <br/>\ntried beatings...). I also find myself helpless against the depression <br/>\nthat H is beginning to suffer, at the same age I developed it. My own <br/>\ndepression led to anorexia, self harm and attempted suicide and years of <br/>\nobnoxius doctors and drug therapy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis problem with her friend which stemmed from somthing she couldn&#39;t <br/>\ncontrol is leading her deeper into depression yet people are treating <br/>\nher like both are her fault and that she chooses to rage or be <br/>\ndepressed. Being a homeschooler in a way makes things worse. Generally <br/>\nparents have to get on for the kids to be friends. If they were at <br/>\nschool then parents wouldn&#39;t even come into it, the girls would meet at <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m going to end my participation in this topic here.
