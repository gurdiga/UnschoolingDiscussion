Charles Hayes and I<br/>\nhave been corresponding for some time now.  Hayes is perhaps our country&#39;s<br/>\nbest thinker on the subject of self-education.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry this morsel from his review of Morris Berman&#39;s new book &quot;The Twilight of<br/>\nAmerican Culture&quot; (New York: W.W. Norton, 2000)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;...[Berman]  points out that out of 158 countries we are 49th in literacy,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that 60 percent of our population has never read a book of any kind, that<br/>\nthe number of truly educated individuals in America may amount to less than<br/>\n5 million people, and that liberal education is being commodified at the<br/>\nuniversity level into little more than another means of entertainment.<br/>\nIndeed, at times it seems to me that the genuine end of history will find<br/>\nAmerica&#39;s epitaph amounting to little more than having become a colossal<br/>\ntheme park.<br/>\n<br/>\nBerman reminds us that &quot;&#39;consciousness&#39; gurus declare that we are in the<br/>\nmidst of a &#39;paradigm shift,&#39; and millions, who never managed to understand<br/>\nthe present paradigm, grunt the phrase like a mantra.&quot; As for remedy he puts<br/>\nit this way, &quot;In terms of a future renewal, much of it will depend on a<br/>\ncommitment to individualism, something that has been much maligned in recent<br/>\nyears. We hear so much trendy, tedious talk today of how bad individualism<br/>\nis, and how we need to think in terms of &#39;the group.&#39; The problem is that<br/>\nthe group usually offers conformity, not genuine community.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t miss this latest intellectual feast which Hayes has so freely served<br/>\nup.
