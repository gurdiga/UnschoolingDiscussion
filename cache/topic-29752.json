Always has. <br/>\nIt&#39;s just a part of who she is. A big part. I sometimes say she was born <br/>\nwith a pencil in her hand. (Although I&#39;m certain that would have hurt. :-o) <br/>\nSo I was moving from that point of joy and interest in her. It was not <br/>\nsomething I was trying to get her to learn. And even still, all of her <br/>\ncursive is not &quot;beautiful&quot;. But her sig is gorgeous. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCasey is also a big time perfectionist. She&#39;s ripped up more pages than I <br/>\ncan count. I try to help her through, pointing out the obvious &quot;it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to be perfect&quot; stuff. At the same time I try to honor her need for a <br/>\nwhat she considers a &quot;perfect&quot; product. I like to tell her that if I ever <br/>\nneeded brain surgery, I&#39;d hope my surgeon was as precise as she is. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Her writing at this point is far from perfect - as is her spelling-&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When Casey is writing for need or meaning, her writing is fast and furious. <br/>\nHer spelling is also inventive, but getting better all the time. How? She <br/>\nasks me, I tell her, she writes it down. It may take 100 tries per word, but <br/>\nshe&#39;s getting there joyfully and with no pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have used Math curriculum in the past and she is great with math - She <br/>\n&gt;&gt;reads really well, but I have never used a phonics, spelling, writing <br/>\n&gt;&gt;curriculum and was wondering if there was a connection there?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Casey&#39;s never used a structured curriculum of any kind. At times she&#39;s <br/>\nplayed around in workbooks, or the Phonics Game (her request :-P~~~) or <br/>\nwhatever, but always in a light, take it or leave it kind of way. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink kids need a structured approach to learn to spell. Casey is making her <br/>\nconnections with words and their spellings all the time. She writes because <br/>\nit&#39;s fun. If it wasn&#39;t fun, I wouldn&#39;t MAKE her for the sake of some <br/>\nsuggestion or schedule in some book. (Not saying anyone is doing that BTW. <br/>\n:o))<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Do you have any suggestions on what helps writing, and spelling develop?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Writing for the joy and usefulness it brings. Reading for the joy and <br/>\nusefulness it brings. Seeing words used in the real world. Having a mom (or <br/>\ndad) around to answer questions, provide spellings and maybe point out a <br/>\nphonics rule in a light, matter of fact way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have also read that sometimes motor skills develop at different levels <br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, of course they do. :o) Kids don&#39;t all learn to walk or talk or ride <br/>\nbikes at the same age, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;- I notice she really presses hard with her pens/pencils - she says her <br/>\n&gt;&gt;hand hurts - maybe she just isn&#39;t ready?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe. I would certainly not force any writing on a child with complaints <br/>\nlike that. Practice won&#39;t help, it&#39;ll just make her hand hurt more and <br/>\npossibly build up a hatred for writing. And it makes it hard to separate the <br/>\nidea of writing (Hey, I have a story I&#39;d like to tell!) and writing (Gee, <br/>\nhow do people get their leters so neat?).<br/>\n<br/>\nConor had those same complaints too. He&#39;s more drawn to keyboards these <br/>\ndays. His dad tries to handwrite as little as possible, too. Conor finds <br/>\nthat pencil grips, fatter pencils, and squeezy hand relaxing toys help when <br/>\nhe does have to handwrite. He&#39;s almost 13 and right now most of his <br/>\nhandwriting involves cheat codes for computer games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I really try not to worry about it - but it&#39;s hard ... I think<br/>\n </span></blockquote>being able to write(not necessarily beautiful) and clearly express yourself <br/>\nis important.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many different ways to express ourselves. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nwriting,or even words are the only way. Try to relax and let your still very <br/>\nyoung daughter ease into it at her own speed. If you focus too much on <br/>\nwriting skills, you may miss her passion or talent in another area of <br/>\nexpression.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"kaydeecross","from":"&quot;kaydeecross&quot; &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: cursive","postDate":"1017072568","msgId":33821,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE3bmkzbytpbjQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYzMHpWbFREMFVaZWMwOGNEMFcwMDAwNTk4Y0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33700,"nextInTopic":33846,"prevInTime":33820,"nextInTime":33822,"topicId":29752,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... for us. ...
