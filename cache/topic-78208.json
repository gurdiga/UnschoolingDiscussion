However, I don&#39;t think that <br/>\nthat existing affection between posters is actually used to taunt others <br/>\nor to play &quot;keep away&quot; from them or to purposely make people feel &quot;less <br/>\nthan&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood point.  If there were an unschooling list which was invitation only and <br/>\nyou kept hearing it was good, but you couldn&#39;t get invited, and they  kept <br/>\nhaving information you wanted but wouldn&#39;t let you have it, THAT might be a <br/>\nclique.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Clique&quot; is an insult-word, used only in negative ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went looking for a dictionary definition but found some better stuff:<br/>\n<br/>\nThree Cheers For Cliques <br/>\nby Michael Cook  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is common practice in our clubs to say &quot;Of course&#39; this club is run by a <br/>\nlittle clique, and nobody can break in.&quot; The connotation is overwhelmingly <br/>\nnegative. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrue sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever it can be said of most clubs that there is a core group of people who <br/>\ndo most of the work. attend virtually all of the events, and keep the <br/>\norganization running. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also form a clique - &quot;A small, exclusive group of people&quot; according to <br/>\nRandom House. No negative connotation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis type of clique doesn&#39;t want to be exclusive. They want others to join <br/>\nthem. They want help doing all of the things they do for the organization. They <br/>\nwant company at all of the eventsthey so faithfully attend. BUT, they will be <br/>\nthere working, anyway. /P&gt; Sure, there are cliques which jealously guard their <br/>\ncontrol over a club and refuse to let other members penetrate their little <br/>\norganizational group, but there are few of those. In most clubs, the small group <br/>\nof people you see regularly on the list of officers and heading committees <br/>\nare really the most interested members. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis type of clique doesn&#39;t deserve jealous critcism. They merit your <br/>\nsupport. The real enemies of the organization are the members who don&#39;t volunteer but <br/>\nstand around complaining about cliques! If there isn&#39;t a core group of <br/>\ninterested peopleto keep a club running, there will soon be no club. When the core <br/>\ngroup decides they have had enough of carrying the load, let&#39;s hope there are <br/>\nother members ready to step in and shoulder it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you helped your club&#39;s clique lately? <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.britcars.net/JAN2000.html\">http://www.britcars.net/JAN2000.html</a><br/>\na site for owners of British automobiles<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid, who are you protecting here?  What are you trying to do?  It seems that<br/>\nyour trying to say that this has damaged the group and that worries you, but<br/>\nit makes me think you are just using this oppurtunity to cast your imaginary<br/>\n&#39;clique&#39; in a light of shame.  I don&#39;t believe such a clique exists.  The term<br/>\n&#39;clique&#39; carries a connotation of exclusion, an element which simply does not<br/>\nexist.  Jonathan&#39;s offhand remark doesn&#39;t seem to have offended anyone, or<br/>\nthey would have said something.  You yourself don&#39;t seem to be offended, just<br/>\ncarrying on with your political manuvering.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that after Jonathan responded to your last email about &#39;Those<br/>\nconcerned about the future of WPLUG&#39; and made some very good points, you have<br/>\nresorted to attacking HIM personally under the cover of, &#39;look what you&#39;ve<br/>\ndone to the group&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(Discussion about a logo contest on wplug.org)<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is a clique, anyhow?<br/>\n    Clique 1. Noun. A small, exclusive set of people. <br/>\n    Exclusive 1. Adjective. not shared with any others, confined to a <br/>\nselected few. <br/>\n    Exclude 1. Verb. To keep out, prevent or forbid the entry of. <br/>\n    <br/>\nSome groups are, by nature, exclusive. It’s important to define the reason <br/>\nfor the exclusivity <br/>\nbefore we call that group a ‘clique’, which has a negative connotation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to run programs or functions in any organization, committees or <br/>\ngroups must be formed. People are chosen, by various methods, to be on such <br/>\ncommittees. If these groups were accessible to everyone at any time, there would be <br/>\nlittle work accomplished. As the saying goes, “Too many cooks spoil the <br/>\nbroth.” Congress is this kind of group. By definition these committees could be <br/>\ncalled ‘cliques,’ as they are exclusive. Cliques are a matter of perception - <br/>\nunless you really are trying to prevent someone from befriending your friend. <br/>\nThis is a truly rare occurrence. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s not our job to judge, to label as cliques or to purposely exclude <br/>\nothers. As Christians, we are a chosen people. From the outside, we might look like <br/>\na clique. Let’s do what we can to be an “inclusive clique.” One that draws <br/>\nothers into fellowship in Christ! <br/>\n<br/>\nYour Sister and the one most likely to crash your party, <br/>\n    Beth Kolar <br/>\n<br/>\nwww.harvestchapel.net<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on just the first page of a google search, I found similar discussions <br/>\nabout religion, geekitude and car ownership.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is for unschoolers to discuss unschooling.<br/>\nIf anyone who is NOT really interested in that feels like an outsider, that&#39;s <br/>\nnot a bad thing.<br/>\nIf people who don&#39;t contribute resent those who do contribute, that&#39;s a <br/>\npersonal problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78839,"nextTopicId":78858}}
