Mine wasn&#39;t so bad - but I did have several other experiences with teachers that weren&#39;t so positive. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow true is it that I tend to know how to please teachers to get an A. I still can do this in graduate school. I am sure there are some of you who have been unschooling for awhile to where it has rubbed off on your own attitude toward learning...I am hoping that this happens for me personally. I want to learn things for the sheer joy of knowing them - not because it will further my &quot;degree&quot; -   How much I have to &quot;unschool&quot; myself! Sometimes I find this easier for my children- as they are all so naturally curious and imaginative. I don&#39;t want to mess that up. It is harder to undue 25 years of schooling.... and let myself just be....<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Elizabeth Roberts <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, August 10, 2004 10:57 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Awesome article about compassion in teaching<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was near tears remembering some of the things I went<br/>\n  through in school.
