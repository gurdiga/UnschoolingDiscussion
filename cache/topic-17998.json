I am learning how to \n  organize MY way. I&#39;m a stamper and so consequently alot of my clutter has to \n  do with my creativity. My daughter on the other hand....(shakes head) needs to \n  learn to put her garbage into the garbage can and her dishes into the kitchen. \n  She makes worse messes in the livingroom than I do! She&#39;s 10, but I&#39;m still \n  trying to get her to do even those basic responsibilities...I&#39;m hoping time \n  will tell as she gets older and gets disgusted with her own messes that she \n  will clean up after herself. Nagging doesn&#39;t work, it produces the opposite \n  extreme...that of a very angry, moody child. So usually I don&#39;t say anything \n  except like once a week, I will say...today we need to get this room cleaned \n  up...so lets have at it and she will help out. But lately the Dr has been \n  telling her she needs to take over the heavier work that I cannot do anymore \n  and she&#39;s sorta getting the idea.

My daughter is almost 3 (will be in mid-May), and I took her<br/>\nto my sister&#39;s public school, where my sister teaches 2nd grade.  Just the<br/>\nvery thought of going in this school didn&#39;t thrill me, as I had decided<br/>\nseveral months ago that I wanted to let my daughter learn at home, but since<br/>\nI love my sister, and the Scholastic Book Fair was going on (got  a nice<br/>\ndiscount through my sister!), I decided to drive 50 miles across the<br/>\nMetroplex (Dallas/Ft. Worth) to visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nRipley (my daughter) did very well with all the children in my sister&#39;s 2nd<br/>\ngrade classroom, ate lunch with them just fine, and played on the playground<br/>\nwith them just fine.  My sister, who arranged to have playground duty so<br/>\nthat we could stay through recess, finally told me that she was very much in<br/>\nfavor of schooling your children at home, whether you home or un-school.<br/>\nThis is coming from a public school teacher!  I had plenty of opportunity to<br/>\nwatch these kids in my sister&#39;s class, and most of them were able to deal<br/>\nvery well with a 3yo interrupting their daily schedule, and one of them even<br/>\nlet Ripley sit in her lap during reading time (the 2nd grader was, however,<br/>\na little taken aback when Ripley starting asking questions about the book<br/>\nthe 2nd grader was reading, some Berenstain&#39;s Bears book, I think).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was just a nice point in an otherwise hairy visit; I&#39;m sure you all know<br/>\nthe rigamarole you have to go through to even visit a public school anymore.<br/>\nPlus, my child likes to eat the stupid stickers they want you to wear!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was both sad (the whole ps atmosphere) and encouraging (my sister&#39;s<br/>\nacceptance and support of me to educate Ripley at home).<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer, in Ft. Worth, glad she&#39;s going to keep her daughter at home!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18246,"nextTopicId":18148}}
