And <br/>\nthere&#39;s no really good way for us to get that across, especially in a writing-only <br/>\nway.  La Leche League meetings are a little better, but even then parents are <br/>\nbehaving in front of other parents and it might not match the way they&#39;ll be <br/>\nwhen they get home.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, though, if a parent says &quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; it can be said with a <br/>\ngreat range of emotion and &quot;message&quot; through posture and intonation, eye <br/>\nmovement, other subtle clues that some people read better than others and some kids <br/>\nlearn to ignore if their parents express too much non-verbally.  So if a <br/>\nparent reports &quot;I just said &#39;Fine&#39;&quot; or &quot;I told him I wasn&#39;t angry,&quot; it&#39;s possible <br/>\nthat the messages were actually &quot;I can&#39;t stand this&quot; and &quot;You suck,&quot; though <br/>\nthe words themselves were not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo long story tied back to beginning, the best parenting book in the world <br/>\nwon&#39;t work for a parent whose personal frustration level is topping out all the <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister used to be totally wired (sometimes with substances, sometimes with <br/>\nguilt, sometimes just naturally).   And everything was the last straw.  &quot;Calm <br/>\ndown,&quot; for her, meant &quot;Take one straw off your hay wagon, so that you can <br/>\nmove, slightly.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next thing that happened was the last straw.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I told her she had to unload at least half that wagon, not just <br/>\nenough to stop yelling or stop crying.  She wasn&#39;t going to be ANY good at <br/>\nparenting if she was blaming her kids for everything she felt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she did get better for a long time.  But she got self-righteously angry <br/>\nabout new and different things and didn&#39;t have the tricks and tools to process <br/>\nthose feelings and move on calmly.  She ended up divorced a couple of years <br/>\nago, and that was NO damned good for her kids, the youngest of whom is 16 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s okay to recommend books or methods or ideas that aren&#39;t <br/>\nspecifically parenting-focussed.

I&#39;m Jenny, mom to two kids: Scotty age<br/>\n&gt; 4 on the 23rd and Eliza almost 10 months, and wife to Chris.  We knew we<br/>\n&gt; were going to homeschool when Scotty was 6 months old, and by the time<br/>\n&gt; he was 2 we were convinced that unschooling was the only way to go.  We<br/>\n&gt; were already practicing mindful parenting so, as a recent thread<br/>\n&gt; discussed, it was not much of a leap to unschooling.  I have been on<br/>\n&gt; Sandra&#39;s New Mexico Homeschooling list for 3 years already and I was<br/>\n&gt; heavily influenced by her posts about unschooling.  I was also totally<br/>\n&gt; fired up by the book Deschooling our Lives edited by Matt Hern.  I have<br/>\n&gt; yet to get into more John Holt and the others because right now I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; spending all my reading time on positive discipline books!<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m writing tonight because we have just had a bit of an upheaval in our<br/>\n&gt; lives-I had to fire Scotty&#39;s long-time babysitter today because of a<br/>\n&gt; serious violation of my trust in her.  I&#39;m heartbroken but I&#39;m sure I<br/>\n&gt; made the right decision.   Anyway, he had been going to her house two<br/>\n&gt; days per week for 6 hours each day.  I really needed this time to work<br/>\n&gt; on our owner-built house, for which I am the general contractor.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; basically like being a WAHM.  So, now that I no longer have child care,<br/>\n&gt; I have some problems to deal with.<br/>\n&gt; People are telling me to put Scotty in preschool.  They are coming up<br/>\n&gt; with the usual stuff about socialization, etc.  They are telling me that<br/>\n&gt; I would like Waldorf schools because they have an unstructured teaching<br/>\n&gt; philosophy.  But that&#39;s the problem-it&#39;s still a set teaching<br/>\n&gt; philosophy!  What if he likes structure?  Or what if he likes some<br/>\n&gt; things to be structured and others to be unstructured?  So, I am 100%<br/>\n&gt; opposed to him going to any kind of school or anything that resembles<br/>\n&gt; school (unless he specifically asks for it-like the swimming lessons you<br/>\n&gt; were discussing).  I have a collection of pat responses to almost every<br/>\n&gt; argument they give me, and I am unswerving in my commitment to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  The only thing I really don&#39;t have an answer to is &quot;how<br/>\n&gt; are you going to get anything done without putting him in some kind of<br/>\n&gt; childcare?&quot;  At this point I don&#39;t want to hire another babysitter so<br/>\n&gt; basically he and his sister are going to be with me full time.<br/>\n&gt; So I guess my question is, how *am* I going to get anything done?<br/>\n&gt; Almost everyone I know has their kids in preschool now, and if they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t they &quot;can&#39;t wait&quot; until they do, so they can finally &quot;get<br/>\n&gt; something done&quot;.  Here&#39;s what I need to do specifically:<br/>\n&gt; Internet research, money management, ordering materials, telephone<br/>\n&gt; calls, and general office work, much of it on the computer.  This is<br/>\n&gt; nearly impossible with Scotty around.

I&#39;m Jenny, mom to two kids: Scotty age<br/>\n4 on the 23rd and Eliza almost 10 months, and wife to Chris.  We knew we<br/>\nwere going to homeschool when Scotty was 6 months old, and by the time<br/>\nhe was 2 we were convinced that unschooling was the only way to go.  We<br/>\nwere already practicing mindful parenting so, as a recent thread<br/>\ndiscussed, it was not much of a leap to unschooling.  I have been on<br/>\nSandra&#39;s New Mexico Homeschooling list for 3 years already and I was<br/>\nheavily influenced by her posts about unschooling.  I was also totally<br/>\nfired up by the book Deschooling our Lives edited by Matt Hern.  I have<br/>\nyet to get into more John Holt and the others because right now I&#39;m<br/>\nspending all my reading time on positive discipline books!<br/>\nI&#39;m writing tonight because we have just had a bit of an upheaval in our<br/>\nlives-I had to fire Scotty&#39;s long-time babysitter today because of a<br/>\nserious violation of my trust in her.  I&#39;m heartbroken but I&#39;m sure I<br/>\nmade the right decision.   Anyway, he had been going to her house two<br/>\ndays per week for 6 hours each day.  I really needed this time to work<br/>\non our owner-built house, for which I am the general contractor.  It&#39;s<br/>\nbasically like being a WAHM.  So, now that I no longer have child care,<br/>\nI have some problems to deal with.<br/>\nPeople are telling me to put Scotty in preschool.  They are coming up<br/>\nwith the usual stuff about socialization, etc.  They are telling me that<br/>\nI would like Waldorf schools because they have an unstructured teaching<br/>\nphilosophy.  But that&#39;s the problem-it&#39;s still a set teaching<br/>\nphilosophy!  What if he likes structure?  Or what if he likes some<br/>\nthings to be structured and others to be unstructured?  So, I am 100%<br/>\nopposed to him going to any kind of school or anything that resembles<br/>\nschool (unless he specifically asks for it-like the swimming lessons you<br/>\nwere discussing).  I have a collection of pat responses to almost every<br/>\nargument they give me, and I am unswerving in my commitment to<br/>\nunschooling.  The only thing I really don&#39;t have an answer to is &quot;how<br/>\nare you going to get anything done without putting him in some kind of<br/>\nchildcare?&quot;  At this point I don&#39;t want to hire another babysitter so<br/>\nbasically he and his sister are going to be with me full time.  <br/>\nSo I guess my question is, how *am* I going to get anything done?<br/>\nAlmost everyone I know has their kids in preschool now, and if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t they &quot;can&#39;t wait&quot; until they do, so they can finally &quot;get<br/>\nsomething done&quot;.  Here&#39;s what I need to do specifically:<br/>\nInternet research, money management, ordering materials, telephone<br/>\ncalls, and general office work, much of it on the computer.  This is<br/>\nnearly impossible with Scotty around.  He can&#39;t stand to have my<br/>\nattention diverted.<br/>\n90% of the housework (because Chris is working on the new house).  <br/>\nActual work on the new house.<br/>\nI would sure appreciate either general or specific advice on how to<br/>\naccomplish these kinds of things with preschool-age children at home.  <br/>\nThanks for reading-this was actually a very therapeutic rant for me<br/>\nafter a troubling day.<br/>\nJenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling didn&#39;t blossom until I stepped away from traditional parenting.","postDate":"1084326104","msgId":93883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTExLjE5NDE0NS4yMTkyLjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":93877,"nextInTopic":93893,"prevInTime":93882,"nextInTime":93885,"topicId":93788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You can find Whole Child, Whole Parent by Polly  Berends at Amazon.

This is so appropriate for me right now. I&#39;ll try to be <br/>\nsuccinct.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest difference in how I see parenting now is that I no longer <br/>\nsee it as my job to *get* my kids to: be, do, say, prepare, achieve, <br/>\ndream, become or learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy job is to point, admire, offer, support, listen, encourage, hug, <br/>\nunderstand, laugh, embrace, shore up, help and learn alongside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m less concerned with how they should be. I&#39;m more interested in who <br/>\nthey really are. (That means I am less worried about preventing them <br/>\nfrom becoming a danger to themselves or having wrong ideas or thoughts <br/>\nor attitudes and more interested in what they actually think, believe, <br/>\ninfer, do or judge right now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m more optimistic about their futures and less anxious about the <br/>\npresent, rather than being anxious about the present and pessimistic <br/>\nabout their futures as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see uniqueness rather than &quot;He is so much like his... X - father, <br/>\nbrother, uncle, the guy I dated in high school...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned to live in trust rather than expectation. Do I trust <br/>\nthat learning is contagious and natural? Do I trust that my child has <br/>\nwhat he needs to make his way in the world? Do I trust that my daughter <br/>\nis capable of judging human behavior and drawing wise conclusions for <br/>\nher own well-being? Or am I still expecting to find dangers, mistakes, <br/>\nmoral failures...?<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that my own life is not about how they are turning out but about <br/>\nthe adventure of life itself and that my living out a life engaged in <br/>\noptimistic learning is contagious. I can&#39;t do it so that they will <br/>\nlearn to live like that. That is phony. But I can live it because it&#39;s <br/>\nthe kind of life I like to life, and by living it, they seem to want to <br/>\nlive like that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are the first ones off the top of my head. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling didn&#39;t blossom until I stepped away from traditional parenting.","postDate":"1084233523","msgId":93788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NC4zNGI1OGVjOS4yZGQxNzEzM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":93807,"prevInTime":93787,"nextInTime":93789,"topicId":93788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1665384180\">&lt;&lt; Unschooling didn&#39;t blossom until I stepped away from traditional <br/>\n<br/>\nparenting.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought maybe that could be a separate topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a kind of rough exchange going on at www.unschooling.com where a mom <br/>\nis being very defensive, and insulting unschoolers for not really caring about <br/>\ntheir kids (implication, not exact words).
