The first<br/>\n&gt; page<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of that section begins with this: &quot;More and more frequently, home<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; schoolers are turned in on child abuse hotlines to social services<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agencies.

Who can you call?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The local public school official insists that your home school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arrangement is not legal and threatens you with criminal charges.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; can you get help *fast?*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is the answer...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The irony was revealed when, during Woodruff&#39;s talk, another HSLDA<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attorney, David Gordon, piped up from the back of the room. He said,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the 60,000 members, if I got 1 call a day [about CPS<br/>\n </span></blockquote>problems]--about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; 200 per year-- which I don&#39;t, that would equal only 1/3 of 1% of<br/>\n&gt; members.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody here should be afraid. Most [CPS] reports come through public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; schools. Nine out of ten end up unfounded or unsubstantiated.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, this brief statement did little to alleviate the fears<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; promoted by the talk and materials. Furthermore, I had the distinct<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impression this comment was not a usual part of the presentation, but<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; added because of my presence--as was Woodruff&#39;s disclaimer, after the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first break, stating that &quot;HSLDA speaks only for it&#39;s members, and we<br/>\n&gt; try<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to make that clear.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, during the panel discussion at day&#39;s end, someone<br/>\n </span></blockquote>asked a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; question like, &quot;How can homeschoolers make ourselves less of a target<br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPS?&quot; The HSLDA response (Woodruff, I believe, but I didn&#39;t write it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; my notes) was, &quot;Don&#39;t physically punish your children in public.&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; was *the* answer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also during the panel discussion, someone asked about daytime<br/>\n </span></blockquote>curfews.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; The panel speakers used scary phrases like the &quot;police take your<br/>\n </span></blockquote>child<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the closest public school or curfew center.&quot;  I forget exactly who<br/>\n </span></blockquote>was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; speaking, but I got the impression that the speakers implied that<br/>\n&gt; daytime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; curfews are a continuing possibility, especially when someone said,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;let<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; HSLDA know that your area is considering a daytime curfew.&quot; None of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; panel mentioned that, here in VA, the law was amended last year to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specifically prohibit daytime curfews; any locality that institutes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>one<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; is in violation of state law.

In the state of Michigan 1, I repeat 1<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling family (to my knowledge) has been truly involved in Social<br/>\n&gt; Services. They were abusive. end of that story.<br/>\n&gt;     I agree with what you are saying. I called HSLDA and asked them<br/>\nquestions<br/>\n&gt; like the what if scenarios. They told me that if I was not already a<br/>\nmember,<br/>\n&gt; they would not take my case. Soooo, If the police come here, take my<br/>\nchild,<br/>\n&gt; and tell me that I have to put him in PS, I grab my trusty telephone, dial<br/>\nup<br/>\n&gt; HSLDA, finally get a human, I am told sorry, we cannot help you. The state<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; Michigan (to my humble knowledge) does not even have a HSLDA<br/>\nrepresentative.<br/>\n&gt;     I can say that Michigan Social Services can be truly deceiving in the<br/>\n&gt; ways they approach their &quot;victims&quot;. My dh is the head of security for<br/>\ntheir<br/>\n&gt; office here, and I have witnessed some devious tactics. BUT when they<br/>\nheard I<br/>\n&gt; was homeschooling, they never said a bad word about it. I have even loaned<br/>\n&gt; out some of my books to caseworkers (for their children). Since my<br/>\ndecision<br/>\n&gt; (June 99) I have not had one CPS (children&#39;s protective services) worker<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; my door. (Other than a friend who incidentally works there, we attend the<br/>\n&gt; same church, LOL)<br/>\n&gt;     my personal insight of HSLDA is NOT to go through them. If you feel<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; need a backbone through the law, hire an attorney. Tell him your fears,<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; he will snuff them directly. So for the cost of  the initial visit<br/>\n(usually<br/>\n&gt; free to $50) you have the same  backing, but with half the money. IF you<br/>\never<br/>\n&gt; need something for the state, you can call your lawyer (and speak to him<br/>\nWOW)<br/>\n&gt; and find out if it is something small or if you need to actually do<br/>\n&gt; something!<br/>\n&gt;      I have an attorney here in Michigan. I call and normally speak<br/>\ndirectly<br/>\n&gt; with him. Even better yet, I call him by the same nickname his wife uses.<br/>\nHe<br/>\n&gt; is helping me through protecting one of my children from his father. I can<br/>\n&gt; normally call him at any time, and I have his HOME NUMBER on my card!!!! I<br/>\n&gt; have asked him homeschool-related questions before. He writes them down,<br/>\n&gt; finds out and gets back with me. he hasn&#39;t added them to the bill (yet,<br/>\nlol)<br/>\n&gt;     IMHO, I would rather see a law firm that I know is in the best<br/>\ninterest<br/>\n&gt; of me. One that I can stop by and get answers, and that I will see the<br/>\nsame<br/>\n&gt; lawyer every time that I need one. I would rather pay to have the same<br/>\nperson<br/>\n&gt; (who is knowledgeable of the case) than one of 100, who were pushed into<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; for today...<br/>\n&gt;     You could pay $100 every year and not need them until your child is in<br/>\n&gt; the 8th grade ($800) or call a private attorney and have him do it for<br/>\n$200.<br/>\n&gt; I cannot afford to pay an entity $100 a year, even if it is for the cover<br/>\n&gt; net. I take the chance, heck, by homeschooling I am taking a chance. the<br/>\n&gt; chance of a better education, future, and life. Just by homeschooling, I<br/>\nam<br/>\n&gt; different -- strange -- not in the norm -- why conform to money hungry<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; now?<br/>\n&gt;     I have seriously considered going into the law practice.

Am I ever grateful<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; NHEN is now here and will be making REAL information available to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public and homeschoolers alike so that this continue misinformation that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is self-serving from H$LDA will be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; seen for what it is!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is closely related to a topic I&#39;ve been investigating--the fear<br/>\n&gt; &gt; inducing element of HSLDA. Last month I attended their Support Group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Seminar, and was struck by several things, including the information and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discussion about the threat to homescholers by Social Services. One of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the presentations was titled &quot;What Parents Should Know About Child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Welfare Agencies.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Scott Woodruff regaled us with tales of CPS folks and assorted law<br/>\n&gt; &gt; officers forcing their way into peoples&#39; homes, and claiming they were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; admitted voluntarily.  He told a horror story of a family whose children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were clued in, by CPS questioners, to the possibilities of child sexual<br/>\n&gt; &gt; abuse. He gave plenty of advice on how to handle such situations, and,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when asked, said that the number of homeschoolers falsely accused of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child abuse/neglect was a &quot;chronic, steady&quot; number, with occasional<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;rashes,&quot; such as an increase in the number of &quot;kids left in the car&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; complaints.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Evonne Bunn, HEAV Exec. Director, interrupted Woodruff, to say that her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; organization &quot;will most often refer parents to HSLDA, and recommend you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; join because you can&#39;t forsee problems.&quot; Woodruff replied with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; recommendation on the HEAV homeschool manual, and especially its legal<br/>\n&gt; &gt; section.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Accompanying all this frightening talk was the 16 page &quot;Dealing With<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Social Services Contacts&quot; section of the seminar workbook. The first<br/>\npage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of that section begins with this: &quot;More and more frequently, home<br/>\n&gt; &gt; schoolers are turned in on child abuse hotlines to social services<br/>\n&gt; &gt; agencies. Families who do not like homeschoolers can make an anonymous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; phone call to the child abuse hotline and fabricate abuse stories about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; home schoolers. The social worker then has the obligation to<br/>\ninvestigate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Each state has a different policy for social workers, but generally they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to come into the family&#39;s home and speak with the children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; separately. To allow either of these to occur involves great risk to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; family.&quot; The last 10 pages of this section include &quot;How to Handle Visits<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From Social Service Agencies,&quot; which uses two fear-inducing scenarios<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; illustrate how to and now not to handle social workers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The seminar workbook also includes a 5 page publication titled &quot;What Is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; HSLDA?&quot; which starts with, &quot;A truant officer is at the door. He pushes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his way in. He will not leave until he can take your children to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public school. What can you do?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A police officer is at your door with an arrest warrant to take your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; six year-old child. Who can you call?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The local public school official insists that your home school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; arrangement is not legal and threatens you with criminal charges. Where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can you get help *fast?*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) is the answer...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The irony was revealed when, during Woodruff&#39;s talk, another HSLDA<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attorney, David Gordon, piped up from the back of the room. He said,<br/>\n&quot;Out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the 60,000 members, if I got 1 call a day [about CPS problems]--about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 200 per year-- which I don&#39;t, that would equal only 1/3 of 1% of<br/>\nmembers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nobody here should be afraid. Most [CPS] reports come through public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; schools. Nine out of ten end up unfounded or unsubstantiated.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course, this brief statement did little to alleviate the fears<br/>\n&gt; &gt; promoted by the talk and materials. Furthermore, I had the distinct<br/>\n&gt; &gt; impression this comment was not a usual part of the presentation, but<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; added because of my presence--as was Woodruff&#39;s disclaimer, after the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; first break, stating that &quot;HSLDA speaks only for it&#39;s members, and we<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to make that clear.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, during the panel discussion at day&#39;s end, someone asked a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; question like, &quot;How can homeschoolers make ourselves less of a target<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; CPS?&quot; The HSLDA response (Woodruff, I believe, but I didn&#39;t write it in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my notes) was, &quot;Don&#39;t physically punish your children in public.&quot; That<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was *the* answer.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also during the panel discussion, someone asked about daytime curfews.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The panel speakers used scary phrases like the &quot;police take your child<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the closest public school or curfew center.&quot;  I forget exactly who was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; speaking, but I got the impression that the speakers implied that<br/>\ndaytime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; curfews are a continuing possibility, especially when someone said, &quot;let<br/>\n&gt; &gt; HSLDA know that your area is considering a daytime curfew.&quot; None of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; panel mentioned that, here in VA, the law was amended last year to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; specifically prohibit daytime curfews; any locality that institutes one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is in violation of state law. Not exactly a small omission. The speaker<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also urged support group leaders to contact HSLDA if a daytime curfew<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were in the works in their area--not to simply point out to legislators<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that such acts are illegal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -Shay<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Q0drTmOcHjEVREzEGz41D0CaqX5f9mphuS5Vuwko6g1nUw8wHwoS_kOxMFXR1OzV0eusVqGJ-YLfGAgFqT6D7oO_Eg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: HSLDA Paranoia/was: Something of interest","postDate":"943807389","msgId":4947,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTkuNDk0Ny45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4943,"nextInTopic":4958,"prevInTime":4946,"nextInTime":4948,"topicId":4937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Speaking of no lawyer in your state, that is another area that they conveniently gloss over.

I mean, I really would like a lawyer to put<br/>\ntogether a form for me that starts out by me admitting that I knew I was<br/>\nbreaking the law.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd all this nonsense about CPS is just that.  By using their advise of<br/>\ncalling H$LDA before you answer the door, blocking the door, sending your<br/>\nkids to hide in another room, you justify investigating a report.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some of the horror stories they come up with really make me wonder! <br/>\nLike the store clerks threatening to turn you in because you swat a kid for<br/>\nmisbehaving.  Most store clerks couldn&#39;t get out of their own way or be<br/>\nbothered to even provide the minimum of service let alone take time to make<br/>\na complaint.  What do these folks do, walk around using the Ezzo sticks in<br/>\npublic??<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ex-MIL from h*ll turned me in and I have CPS on my doorstep when I got<br/>\nback from the store (kidlets were out back with the dogs playing) which was<br/>\non the same block as our house.  The guy explained why he was there and I<br/>\nlaughed.  I told him to go talk to MIL and then call me.  Well, she took<br/>\ncare of the call, alright!  The guy called me back and told me that he had<br/>\nflagged my file and put a synopsis of his visit with MIL in there.  He<br/>\nended the call by asking how I had managed to stay married as long as I had<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you treat the vast majority of these folks like people instead of with<br/>\nparanoia, you get treated the same.  But then, who would join H$LDA??<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Shay Seaborne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s-seaborne@...\">s-seaborne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: HSLDA Paranoia/was: Something of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>interest<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Date: Sunday, November 28, 1999 1:10 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Shay Seaborne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s-seaborne@...\">s-seaborne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sat, 27 Nov 1999 22:21:32 -0800<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Something of interest...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;some H$LDA paranoia/fear encouraging garbage.

One of<br/>\n&gt; the presentations was titled &quot;What Parents Should Know About Child<br/>\n&gt; Welfare Agencies.&quot;   <br/>\n&gt; \tScott Woodruff regaled us with tales of CPS folks and assorted law<br/>\n&gt; officers forcing their way into peoples&#39; homes, and claiming they were<br/>\n&gt; admitted voluntarily.

He gave plenty of advice on how to handle such situations, and,<br/>\n&gt; when asked, said that the number of homeschoolers falsely accused of<br/>\n&gt; child abuse/neglect was a &quot;chronic, steady&quot; number, with occasional<br/>\n&gt; &quot;rashes,&quot; such as an increase in the number of &quot;kids left in the car&quot;<br/>\n&gt; complaints.<br/>\n&gt; \t Evonne Bunn, HEAV Exec. Director, interrupted Woodruff, to say that her<br/>\n&gt; organization &quot;will most often refer parents to HSLDA, and recommend you<br/>\n&gt; join because you can&#39;t forsee problems.&quot; Woodruff replied with a<br/>\n&gt; recommendation on the HEAV homeschool manual, and especially its legal<br/>\n&gt; section.<br/>\n&gt; \tAccompanying all this frightening talk was the 16 page &quot;Dealing With<br/>\n&gt; Social Services Contacts&quot; section of the seminar workbook. The first page<br/>\n&gt; of that section begins with this: &quot;More and more frequently, home<br/>\n&gt; schoolers are turned in on child abuse hotlines to social services<br/>\n&gt; agencies.

In the state of Michigan 1, I repeat 1 <br/>\nhomeschooling family (to my knowledge) has been truly involved in Social <br/>\nServices. They were abusive. end of that story. <br/>\n    I agree with what you are saying. I called HSLDA and asked them questions <br/>\nlike the what if scenarios. They told me that if I was not already a member, <br/>\nthey would not take my case. Soooo, If the police come here, take my child, <br/>\nand tell me that I have to put him in PS, I grab my trusty telephone, dial up <br/>\nHSLDA, finally get a human, I am told sorry, we cannot help you. The state of <br/>\nMichigan (to my humble knowledge) does not even have a HSLDA representative. <br/>\n    I can say that Michigan Social Services can be truly deceiving in the <br/>\nways they approach their &quot;victims&quot;. My dh is the head of security for their <br/>\noffice here, and I have witnessed some devious tactics. BUT when they heard I <br/>\nwas homeschooling, they never said a bad word about it. I have even loaned <br/>\nout some of my books to caseworkers (for their children). Since my decision <br/>\n(June 99) I have not had one CPS (children&#39;s protective services) worker at <br/>\nmy door. (Other than a friend who incidentally works there, we attend the <br/>\nsame church, LOL)<br/>\n    my personal insight of HSLDA is NOT to go through them. If you feel you <br/>\nneed a backbone through the law, hire an attorney. Tell him your fears, and <br/>\nhe will snuff them directly. So for the cost of  the initial visit (usually <br/>\nfree to $50) you have the same  backing, but with half the money. IF you ever <br/>\nneed something for the state, you can call your lawyer (and speak to him WOW) <br/>\nand find out if it is something small or if you need to actually do <br/>\nsomething! <br/>\n     I have an attorney here in Michigan. I call and normally speak directly <br/>\nwith him. Even better yet, I call him by the same nickname his wife uses. He <br/>\nis helping me through protecting one of my children from his father. I can <br/>\nnormally call him at any time, and I have his HOME NUMBER on my card!!!! I <br/>\nhave asked him homeschool-related questions before. He writes them down, <br/>\nfinds out and gets back with me. he hasn&#39;t added them to the bill (yet, lol) <br/>\n    IMHO, I would rather see a law firm that I know is in the best interest <br/>\nof me. One that I can stop by and get answers, and that I will see the same <br/>\nlawyer every time that I need one. I would rather pay to have the same person <br/>\n(who is knowledgeable of the case) than one of 100, who were pushed into it <br/>\nfor today... <br/>\n    You could pay $100 every year and not need them until your child is in <br/>\nthe 8th grade ($800) or call a private attorney and have him do it for $200. <br/>\nI cannot afford to pay an entity $100 a year, even if it is for the cover <br/>\nnet. I take the chance, heck, by homeschooling I am taking a chance. the <br/>\nchance of a better education, future, and life. Just by homeschooling, I am <br/>\ndifferent -- strange -- not in the norm -- why conform to money hungry people <br/>\nnow?<br/>\n    I have seriously considered going into the law practice. Just for the <br/>\nhomeschooling families. HSLDA makes me want to even more. <br/>\n    Okay, I give the soapbox up, ever so unwillingly......for now!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nTeacher and Mommy of 4 homeschooling fanatics, wife to the best principal, <br/>\nprotector of many pets and wild ones, and unpublished writer.<br/>\n            ***Life&#39;s Learnings Academy - Protecting Our Children***<br/>\n        IT&#39;S GREAT TO LEARN WHERE THE PRINCIPAL LOVES YOU<br/>\n                           ICQ: 43428000     AOL IM: Lifeslearn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Shay Seaborne","from":"Shay Seaborne &lt;s-seaborne@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"GF5p8gJbXCtkWnfKzFiKlmRwP4EauyJXx29rUnNh3qY9GINcYWfGVj5-erZXrAQsLshlfbus9j5_sV1qJoTlT0wjzPFYloiqZMo","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: HSLDA Paranoia/was: Something of interest","postDate":"943780223","msgId":4937,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTkuNDkzNy45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4939,"prevInTime":4936,"nextInTime":4938,"topicId":4937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sat, 27 Nov 1999 22:21:32 -0800 From: Lynda  Subject: Re: Something of interest...
