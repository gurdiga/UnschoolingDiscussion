They&#39;ve already said (more than once, more than twice) that posters<br/>\nwho are coping with just having taken their children out of a bad situation<br/>\nin a school are of course going to talk about that bad situation (and<br/>\nshould) in their process of heading toward healing, and in their process of<br/>\nbeginning unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a big (huge, galactic) difference between Jane Doe showing up on<br/>\nthe list with school tales of horror just done to her 10 year old twins and<br/>\nhow she&#39;s so glad to find unschooling and can we please help... versus what<br/>\nseems to be your never-ending posts that either attempt to derail<br/>\nnon-school-bashing discussions to school-bashing discussions or complain<br/>\nthat you can&#39;t understand simple list parameters, simply stated, repeatedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, others here have given it as their opinion that you must know that<br/>\nyou&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing. But I&#39;ve seen people who can write pretty<br/>\nwell who are so caught up with their own voices that they truly do NOT hear<br/>\nanyone else (similar to the way a pet Basset Hound will pick up a ground<br/>\nscent and will not HEAR his owners calling him away from the busy road --<br/>\nnot a matter of ignoring, just a matter of physical limitation and strong<br/>\ntracking drive).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you really don&#39;t understand but are sincere in wanting to, I suggest<br/>\nyou email one of the moderators privately and try to get it worked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, you are doing what others have said, intentionally<br/>\nderailing conversations, then please stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam &quot;back from hiatus&quot; Hartley<br/>\n(And the more things change, the more they stay the same.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41993,"nextTopicId":2713}}
