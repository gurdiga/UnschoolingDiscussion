By<br/>\n&gt; &quot;permissive&quot; I mean they need to permit their children to be themselves,<br/>\n&gt; rather than nudging them and nipping them too much towards being some<br/>\n&gt; other type of more conventional or better paid person.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Betsy </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] (unknown)","postDate":"1061992099","msgId":79221,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCNzIyRUUzLjFEOEREJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJpaWFpaytxZjZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79220,"nextInTopic":79223,"prevInTime":79220,"nextInTime":79222,"topicId":79220,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
