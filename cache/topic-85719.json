They named it the COKE Float and christened it with a can of the stuff.  Grammy sent photos to the company and they sent a nice letter and some freebie coupons.  I teased her that if they had actually painted it red instead of green (some left over stuff they had) they might have ended up in a commercial or add or something!!  I have the letter etc in our scrapbook.  Very cool summer fun.<br/>\nBeth snowed-in in MD<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85644,"nextTopicId":85668}}
