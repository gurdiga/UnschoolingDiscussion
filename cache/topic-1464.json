It&#39;s interesting<br/>\n that with as many homeschoolers as there are in this area, that there aren&#39;t<br/>\n many unschoolers.  This will be our first year homeschooling, after a very<br/>\n bad kindergarten year.  I actually found out about homeschooling by trying<br/>\n to find anti-homeschooling info for a case I&#39;m working on... and lo and<br/>\n behold I started to really like the idea of child-led learning and the<br/>\n entire unschooling theory.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJenn,<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t ya know......I have a girl 14 and you have a boy 6!!  Couldn&#39;t be <br/>\nmore opposite!! Oh well!!  I started homeschooling Valerie right after <br/>\nKindergarten also...we had been to a museum in Chicago and she was very <br/>\ninterested in Egypt (the museum had a great pyramid) so we bought lots of <br/>\nbooks, etc.  When she came back to school, she asked the teacher when they <br/>\ncould study Egypt and was told that &quot;you aren&#39;t scheduled to be interested in <br/>\nthat until you&#39;re older&quot;!!!  We started with Calvert (which as you may or may <br/>\nnot know is veeerrrry  structured) because I wasn&#39;t sure if I could do it <br/>\nalone,  but pretty soon we couldn&#39;t stand the one-lesson-a-day, <br/>\n&quot;school-at-home&quot; stuff...that was not what I thought home education was going <br/>\nto be like.  I first learned about unschooling when I read Mary Pride&#39;s &quot;Big <br/>\nBook of Home Learning&quot; (or something like that) and she described all the <br/>\ndifferent approaches to home education.  Unschooling was one way and she <br/>\nmentioned John Holt and his theories.  I bought &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; and that was <br/>\nit!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you do??.....you mentioned working on a &quot;case&quot;.  You said you came <br/>\nback to Jax...are you natives?  We&#39;re all from Los Angeles with a <br/>\nhubby-career stop in St. Louis, but we love it here...a lot like &quot;home&quot; <br/>\nwithout all the problems of LA (so far....fingers crossed).<br/>\n<br/>\nSam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1461,"nextTopicId":1441}}
