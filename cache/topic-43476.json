But Joseph actually time <br/>\nouts himself. He likes and actually needs his time alone far more than any <br/>\nof us in the family. So time outs don&#39;t work cause he likes that. So we <br/>\ndon&#39;t do time outs with him anymore. And to clarify again, our time outs are <br/>\nnot &quot;go to your room&quot; it&#39;s more like a &quot;I know you must be upset maybe you <br/>\nneed some time to think about, etc&quot;<br/>\nSo that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to find what does work for him to get the point. I <br/>\nfind that most of what works with the knowledge I have doesn&#39;t work with <br/>\nJoseph.

Let&#39;s try again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is rather an old soul and so very different from our other 3.<br/>\nMuch more complex. He just doesn&#39;t get keeping his hands to himself<br/>\nwith his sister. I also don&#39;t go with the never hit thing and have<br/>\nexplained that whole scenario. He gets that, he understands that it&#39;s<br/>\nnot nice to hit or even productive within the family.

I just can&#39;t seem to get him to come to me or<br/>\nsay something to her first. His first reaction is to pop her one. Now<br/>\nit&#39;s not really bad.(meaning she&#39;s not really physically hurt) He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nuse anything but his hand and it&#39;s<br/>\nnot a punch or anything and she gets very dramatic when he does it.<br/>\nThe whole thing ends up a major deal on both parts.

You can tell right away he&#39;s sorry he does it but just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think about it first. We&#39;ve worked out together all kinds of<br/>\nother ways for him to solve the problem but when the time comes, he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t use any of them.
