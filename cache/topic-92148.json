To answer your","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-457843297\">Thanks for the prompt response Kelly, Rue and Pam!  We watch a lot of <br/>\nScooby around here, so the misspell was totally understood as <br/>\nproactive!  To answer your question, we live about an hour south of <br/>\nSt. Louis, MO. I checked out the site Rue suggested.  Looks really <br/>\ninteresting.  I am hoping to get a few families going out here in the <br/>\nboonies so I don&#39;t have to drive so far for the St. Louis group <br/>\nactivities.  I participate in a St. Louis group and had found a <br/>\nfamily that was in the southern suburbs, but they moved!  So instead, <br/>\nI&#39;m shifting my focus.  My girls are old enough to help out too!  And <br/>\nas for showing up at functions by yourself, Pam, 90% of the <br/>\nactivities we&#39;ve done in the past 10 months have been just us.  My <br/>\n13yo dd even tried getting her friends together on a Saturday <br/>\nafternoon for a matinee recently and 4 of the 6 invited dropped out <br/>\nat the last minute.  It ended up being like a DATE!  Oh well, we <br/>\nstill plan the activities cuz they are so fun!  Just need to take all <br/>\nthis wonderful info and get moving on it!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92122,"nextTopicId":92152}}
