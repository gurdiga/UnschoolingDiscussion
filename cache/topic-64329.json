He said to me, &quot;My mom scared me.&quot;  I said,<br/>\n&quot;She was worried about you because you wandered off.&quot;  He just looked at<br/>\nme and said, &quot;No.  She doesn&#39;t care about me.  She doesn&#39;t even care<br/>\nwhether I grow up.&quot;  I didn&#39;t know what to say to him.  He was about<br/>\nfour.  She didn&#39;t look at him again until she was ready to go home.&gt;<br/>\nThat kind of stuff kills me.
