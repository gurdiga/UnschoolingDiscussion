I used to work in a preschool, and it was just like you describe. <br/>\n  I loved being around the kids, but I HATED the &quot;make out your lesson plan&quot; <br/>\ndemands from the director ( who was really just operating under the command <br/>\nof the preschool Board of Directors)   Anna and I talked about how totally <br/>\nludicrous it was to try to mold those little kids to such a structured day.   <br/>\nWe talked about ways to nurture and &quot;take care&quot;  of 10   2 yos at one time.  <br/>\nHow to handle &quot;nap/quiet&quot; time for kids who need and want to sleep and kids <br/>\nwho don&#39;t, meal times, outside time.. all the standard daycare routines.   <br/>\nAnna had solutions and ideas that were so wise and sensitive to children.   I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Anna, you are so wise, you must have lived 3 lives&quot; .. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n  I know that some parents have to work. They have to put thier children in <br/>\ndaycare. Everything   I have learned about children in my own experiences, <br/>\ncoupled with my recent embracing of unschooling, has confirmed to me that the <br/>\nMontessori method of preschool/daycare is the best alternative IF a parent <br/>\nhas to put thier child in an out of the home child care situation.  My neice <br/>\nand nephew go to a public Montessori school and they absolutely love it. If <br/>\nthey didnt go there, my sister would most likely homeschool.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs we discussed Montessori methods, Anna said that she wants to have a <br/>\nMontessori preschool, and maybe even a Montessori  &quot;grade&quot; school, when she <br/>\ngrows up.  I am going to call our local Montessori school next week and see <br/>\nif she can volunteer.  She is VERY excited!   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65535,"nextTopicId":65541}}
