But he did say that if my kids ever want to get into any good (selective) college <br/>\n  they&#39;ll HAVE to have good SAT&#39;s whether we like it or not.  He was very nice and I think his point had more to do with his thought that reality dictates their necessity, not that testing is a poor way to evaluate learning.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever really run into a situation where he&#39;s *had* to think about how to get around it.  And if the circumstances had been different, I might have talked more about that.   He was a family member visiting a patient that I had, and circumstances were such that I did not want to cause any distress.  He *DID* say that the university where he teaches doesn&#39;t use SAT&#39;s though, and I thought that was interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He teaches in West Virginia I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But, at that point, I started using my &quot;evasive&quot; tactics then (aka diplomacy LOL) and said that I have been reading up on it and that I think I&quot;ve found some ways around it.  I also mentioned that I wasn&#39;t quite sure which direction my kids were going to take yet so it wasn&#39;t really an issue quite yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  In my favor though, the reason we began talking was bec. he was watching a Benedict Arnold movie and telling me how the movie has it all wrong, etc.  We got to talking about history and he said his students often don&#39;t know about the names of the two original political parties, etc.  I knew about them (but couldn&#39;t remember their names).  And then we got to talking about Jefferson and I said &quot;oh yeah, he&#39;s the one who was sort of the aristocrat but believed that every man should have a vote, and not be overun by aristrocracy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  From there we got into a lively discussion about history, students, education, etc etc.  And the SAT kind of fell by the wayside...but he did say he was impressed that a nurse would know this information when his political science majors and History majors do not.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We also talked about learning and some of the books I&#39;ve chosen to have around the house...some of the ones we&#39;ve read.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Overall, I think we agreed on more than we would have disagreed on. I *really* enjoyed the discussion and I know he did too.  Its so neat to see someone come alive with their passion like that and it was very affirming to be able to say &quot;I never learned this stuff in school, but I&#39;m learning it now with my kids&quot;.   We had so much to talk about.  We talked about the constitution and declaration, etc etc. and I told him how I finally understood how the constitution came to be when I read it side by side with the declaration and how we had never done that in school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I even shared that I was involved in the legislative effort here in PA and that the legislators on the ed commmittee don&#39;t even know what is in the PA constitution (sad isn&#39;t it!).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The whole family was such a neat neat family.

We were supposed to take a trip together.  Our boys have never met though, and we&#39;ve never done anything like that before.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and I are very different in how we parent, etc.  It turned out we couldn&#39;t go on the trip anyway, but I was glad because after thinking about it, I realized it very well could have been a disaster.  She would have seen some things in my son that she would have &quot;disciplined&quot; and I would have handled it much differently than she does.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe talks about her son all the time and I do understand her frustration, but I think she needs to change the way she thinks about him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the only way I seem to be able to maintain many of these kinds of friendships is just not to talk about what I do or how I do it, and not to have our kids spend time together, or at least under certain circumstances.  I share very little of my philosophy with these people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts not hard in this case because we are co-workers so we see each other there without having to get together outside of work.  But I also have friends of all kinds everywhere, and there are just some people who I count as a friend but not the kind of friend I would share things with.  There are just different kinds of friends I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts amazing to me to listen to some of these people though.  When I told my hacker story, the first thing they jumped on was why an 11 year old would be online chatting in the first place (sigh).  I&#39;ve met really wonderful people online and spent time at their HOMES!  Why would I deny that to my children? It expands their universe and their cultural experience to meet people this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many people have bought into a deeper philsophy, not just about education, not just about spanking or &quot;training a child&quot; but the idea that children are really little more than animals (though none of them would ever use &quot;animal&quot; to describe their child&#39;s intelligence).   People just cannot conceive that children would have intelligent thinking even at their young ages and that it is *good* to support and encourage that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked me last night why I homeschool.  Turned out he was a college history prof. but I didn&#39;t know that right away.  I told him it wasn&#39;t the teachers necessarily, and we liked family time together, but I want my kids to have a real opinion on things...even if it differs with authority.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked if I was prepping them for SAT&#39;s.

Look at the many people you and your daughter <br/>\nwill meet who will see your relationship and reconsider their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend I&#39;d known for years before either of us had children.  She has <br/>\nnot excuse for spanking but that she&#39;s just controlling and mean.  Although <br/>\nshe has fundamentalist ancestors (grandparents and beyond there), she was <br/>\nraised &quot;logically&quot; and scientifically.  And they had saved in their set of <br/>\nlogical &quot;facts&quot; that if you didn&#39;t spank kids they would be bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when Kirby was being absolutely normal and curious and active, and her <br/>\ndaughter was sitting right where they had told her to sit and being quiet <br/>\nthey way they told her to be, they wanted me to spank Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main purpose was so that they were justified.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey would have been happy for me to hurt Kirby to make their daughter feel <br/>\nbetter about her sitting still to avoid a spanking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that sad?<br/>\n<br/>\nOur friendship started to fail then.   <br/>\nShe told me that Kirby was going to grow up to hit me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent situation is her kids are cynical and frustrated and mean and I have <br/>\nbeen told by a mutual friend that her son (Marty&#39;s age) has actually hit her <br/>\nat least once.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are happy and peaceable and generous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe both had choices.  I asked her several times to think about homeschooling. <br/>\n She said she might homeschool when they were older.  But by the time they <br/>\nwere older the dad had shot himself in the head and she had to work fulltime. <br/>\n  More happiness sooner could have turned their lives around HUGELY.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dozen+ families who knew both my family AND that family have a no-brainer <br/>\ndisplay of whether being gentle with little kids can turn out well, and <br/>\nwhether spanking guarantees good teen behavior.   And more.  It took a while <br/>\nto set the tableaux up for them, and I&#39;m sad that it involved a death, but <br/>\ntwelve, fourteen years after the parting of ways, we are making serious <br/>\ndifferences in MANY lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1658973,"authorName":"Barb Eaton","from":"Barb Eaton &lt;homemama@...&gt;","profile":"homesmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: The EVILS of  Exercises for Mindful Parenting /Re:\t[Unschooling-dotcom] I...","postDate":"1044216917","msgId":57638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNjJFNjg0LjE1RTgxJWhvbWVtYW1hQGluZmluZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5ZS4xMDRlMmI5OC4yYjZlZDQxM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57636,"nextInTopic":57640,"prevInTime":57637,"nextInTime":57639,"topicId":57636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I mm join you there Kris.

I <br/>\nunderstood why she did what she did, even when it appeared to be &quot;bad&quot;.  Even <br/>\nselfishness comes from a real human need.  Now I have to explain this concept <br/>\nto HER when dealing with her brother!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Lanora was three we were her friend&#39;s birthday party.  The people <br/>\nattending were primarily from church.  One woman, an avid spanker, came to me <br/>\ninsisting that I start spanking Lanora because she was becoming a brat.  <br/>\nEvidently Lanora had yelled at this woman&#39;s mother, &quot;You get out of here!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout seeing your child as whole and perfect the knee jerk reaction would <br/>\nbe to assume the worst.  Instead, I simply ASKED why.  She had recently <br/>\nlearned about &quot;stranger danger&quot; and had been told that if she was approached <br/>\nby a stranger and couldn&#39;t get to an adult she trusted that she should yell <br/>\nat them to go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe woman, someone Lanora didn&#39;t know, came up to her while she was standing <br/>\ninside a play structure.  She couldn&#39;t get out and run to me so she did what <br/>\nshe had heard.  Real simple, no rudeness, no evil &quot;sin&quot; nature, no need for <br/>\ncorrection of any kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen so many parents in church accuse their kids, refuse to hear any <br/>\nexplanation and then punish.  These are the same people who look at me like <br/>\nI&#39;ve got two heads when I BELIEVE my kids.  They can&#39;t conceive of trusting <br/>\ntheir own children!
