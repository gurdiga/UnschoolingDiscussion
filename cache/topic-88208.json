But she doesn&#39;t dance. She&#39;d be up on stage with music just moving around..it&#39;d be embarassing. Ok..maybe not for her, but it would for me. And while maybe not for her...I doubt she&#39;d come off the stage and nobody have laughed at her. People can be cruel and no offense but I don&#39;t know a darn person who would be there. You can tell me that nobody there would do that...but how do I really know that?<br/>\n <br/>\nI didn&#39;t remind her of the way she was teased at a dance she went to, where I just let her go and do her own thing like she had just talk about doing. She was hurt, and I hurt for her. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll think about it some more though.But I&#39;d rather she slow down and really look at all of the possibilities of what she can do, and do well, rather than doing something simply for the sake of doing something which is where I think this idea came from. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 1/8/2004 9:07:30 PM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamabethuscg@...\">mamabethuscg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-But when do you really dance?

Is this just for the children or is it anyone who&#39;d like to perform? <br/>\n <br/>\nI just had a good conversation with Sarah. Right away when I told her about it she got excited and started yammering about dancing or something, but she&#39;s NOT a dancer. I said that I didn&#39;t think dancing would be a good idea, and she started to get upset. I said &quot;Now hold on. I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t be in the talent show. I know you just want to show everyone how special you are. But when do you really dance? Would that really be the best way to show your special-ness? What might be a really really good way to show that?&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nWe thought for a couple minutes about just what she likes to do and I remembered how much she enjoys memorizing her Bible verses for AWANAs. She has a great memory, and enjoys being on stage as well. She has been in a production of &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; and a couple of small skits through our church. So I suggested that she memorize and recite a poem or something. She&#39;s very excited about the opportunity, and so am I. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s exciting to watch her beginning to blossom with this aspect of herself..the acting/reciting part. She&#39;s always had a great imagination and ability to fully immerse herself in &quot;playing pretend.&quot; I didn&#39;t become interested in theater until high school, my thing was always just music. But I do enjoy it. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not?!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
