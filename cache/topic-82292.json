They don&#39;t sit<br/>\n&gt; around and do long division or divide fractions or even solve quadratic<br/>\n&gt; equations &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What they do is &quot;play around.&quot; In fact, they play games. Some games are<br/>\n&gt; number games, some are spatial puzzles, some are strategy games and<br/>\n&gt; others are logic games.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t just play the same old games, though. Mostly, they take a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;game&quot; that has been played and won by somebody and they change the<br/>\n&gt; rules a little and then they watch it play out and look at how the play<br/>\n&gt; of the game changes and how the outcomes change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Only the very most brilliant mathematician ever makes up a whole new<br/>\n&gt; game.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So - when you play games, you are doing exactly what mathematicians<br/>\n&gt; really do IF you fool with the games a bit, experiment, see how the<br/>\n&gt; play change if you change a rule here and there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are lots of ways to change game rules - sometimes a simple<br/>\n&gt; seemingly innocuous change can have major impacts on how the game plays<br/>\n&gt; out and what the outcome is.  What if you let people have the option of<br/>\n&gt; skipping a turn, for example? Or - what if at the end of a turn they<br/>\n&gt; roll a die and call out a number - if they get a match with the number<br/>\n&gt; on the die, they get an extra turn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh - and when you make up games and they flop - be sure to examine why<br/>\n&gt; they flop - that is a big huge part of what mathematicians do, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

He <br/>\ncame to talk to me about it last night.  He&#39;s rejected two plans, and got a <br/>\nphone call from a friend asking him to hurry, because he wanted to play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said he wants it to be &quot;money based,&quot; but he doens&#39;t want people to cheat, <br/>\nand the main problem with money-based games (points, but they&#39;re calling them <br/>\ndollars) is people just cheat to get money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a wild-west based game the ways to get money (that he discussed) are <br/>\nrents, fines, bounties, bank robbery, mining and selling properties.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are &quot;battles,&quot; in this case gun battles.  He wants to make them <br/>\nfairly quick, like no more than three rolls each.  He tried working with a <br/>\nleast-points-was-best chart, but the problem there is it&#39;s not balanced.  If you <br/>\nroll three dice (in this case, online dice, which are little random-number <br/>\ngenerator routines with dice pictures or just number series like 1-4-5) you don&#39;t <br/>\nget all the numbers between 1 and 18.  You only get 3 to 18, because you can&#39;t <br/>\nroll a one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was really interesting to hear him pouring out all his mathematical and <br/>\nlogistical situations.  It seemed to be so complex as to not be worth doing, but <br/>\nthen I look at his dad who voluntarily became an engineer and who works with <br/>\nsystems integration and sometimes long, LONG piles of sheets of computer code, <br/>\nlooking pretty merrily for why one subroutine occasionally doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nEEEEEP!<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I couldn&#39;t get my webpage text to turn back to another color and I <br/>\nwas about to give up, and that was mostly in English!

Or - what if at the end of a turn they <br/>\nroll a die and call out a number - if they get a match with the number <br/>\non the die, they get an extra turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - and when you make up games and they flop - be sure to examine why <br/>\nthey flop - that is a big huge part of what mathematicians do, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Kings Corner","postDate":"1065494798","msgId":82302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzOGM3ZCQzZTJhNWMzMCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwMDI2OUNFLUY4NkEtMTFENy1BQ0NBLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":82294,"nextInTopic":82303,"prevInTime":82301,"nextInTime":82303,"topicId":82292,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2018848524\">&lt;&lt;Another fun thing to do is change the rules a little so you can play <br/>\nwith some of the more unusual dice.

First person rolls. They can choose to <br/>\n&quot;stay&quot; or roll again. If they roll again, they add what they got the <br/>\nfirst time to the new roll. Again, they can choose to stay or roll <br/>\nagain. If they choose to roll again, they add the third number to their <br/>\ntotal.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is player two&#39;s turn. Player two must roll as many times as <br/>\nplayer one did.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth players are trying to get as close to 12 as possible without <br/>\nreaching 12 or more. If player one goes over, player two automatically <br/>\nwins a point for that turn. If player one doesn&#39;t go over, and player <br/>\ntwo doesn&#39;t go over in the same number of rolls, then whoever is closer <br/>\nto 12 wins the point. If player one doesn&#39;t go over, but player two <br/>\ndoes, then player one wins the point. Continue to play, alternating <br/>\ngoing first.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can either just say the game is over when one of the players <br/>\nreaches five points and wins, or you can make it more exciting and have <br/>\nit that once either player has gotten to five points, you win by being <br/>\nahead of the other player by at least 2 points.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122649447,"authorName":"sonyacurti","from":"&quot;sonyacurti&quot; &lt;jcurtielectric@...&gt;","profile":"sonyacurti","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Kings Corner","postDate":"1065489511","msgId":82292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJsdDQ5NytrNjBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":82294,"prevInTime":82291,"nextInTime":82293,"topicId":82292,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh I have some fond memories playing that game with my grandmother.
