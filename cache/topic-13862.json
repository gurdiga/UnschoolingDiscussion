After removing my then 11yr old from school we did <br/>\nschool at home and moved onto unschooling because it didnt work.<br/>\nFor 4 months my dd has been deschooling - I waited and waited and <br/>\nwaited for something to happen....becoming more and more desperate. <br/>\nSuggesting things - starting things - but all she wanted to do was <br/>\nwatch TV.  I bought a mathwork book. (This is the only structured <br/>\nthing I insisted she do)......and waited.<br/>\nToni is a night owl and a late riser. I am the opposite and I found <br/>\nthis hard to handle - but I allowed her body clock to take over.  I <br/>\nlearned not to nag.  I also learned that Toni is at her best late <br/>\nafternoon and early evening - I also found that she works better with <br/>\nnoise.......<br/>\nToni did 5 pages of math yesterday while watching TV and got most of <br/>\nthem right!! This is happening more and more.  She has several e-pals <br/>\nwho she now correspondces with several times a week - before i used <br/>\nto TELL her to answere these emails and she would leave them - Now <br/>\nthat i leave her to her own device as far as *school* goes, we get <br/>\nmuch more done.<br/>\nSo dont give up.
