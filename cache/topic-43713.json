For example, my dh said, they wouldn&#39;t have  learned cello and violin if you wouldn&#39;t have suggested it.  Or another example would be, if we were traveling somewhere and the kids didn&#39;t want to see a cathedral and would rather go play in an arcade they would miss out on a historical cathedral.  These are the questions I get alot of.  <br/>\n  I think that me being who I am and the way my kids are we will find wonder where ever we go.

Instead, I<br/>\n  hear conversations stressing the importance of making the kids &quot;do&quot; work<br/>\n  over and over from the homeschool support group that we meet with weekly.<br/>\n  Most if not all of the moms are into academics - in varying degrees. Some<br/>\n  are strict pre-packaged curriculum users and others construct their own<br/>\n  curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\n  While they do accept me as an unschooler, they ask me questions that I know<br/>\n  must concern them about how I&#39;m educating my boys. Today they asked me &quot;so<br/>\n  what do you guys DO all day if you don&#39;t do schoolwork?&quot;. I was honest and<br/>\n  couldn&#39;t think of a better answer and told them that the kids spend a lot of<br/>\n  time on the computer and how I don&#39;t mind that at all because I see them<br/>\n  being challenged by these computer games all the time. They asked me &quot;and<br/>\n  they can watch TV whenever they want?&quot; and I said yes they can, but they&#39;ve<br/>\n  really self-regulated themselves and don&#39;t spend more than a couple hours a<br/>\n  day watching TV - most days less. Well, I could tell I just wasn&#39;t<br/>\n  convincing them that this was the best way to go. I could almost hear their<br/>\n  self-righteous mutterings to themselves like &quot;those poor boys won&#39;t amount<br/>\n  to anything because Karin isn&#39;t giving them a proper education!&quot; Okay, they<br/>\n  didn&#39;t say that but I could just tell they were thinking it. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;Hmmmmm .... sort how I feel after trying to implement unschooling!!  I<br/>\n  thought I had settled the whole unschooling thing, and &gt;dh was a &quot;go&quot; for<br/>\n  it, but today the questions started again.   &quot;Sooooo..... when are you going<br/>\n  to start up with the kids?  I &gt;mean, you had a really good summer, but<br/>\n  shouldn&#39;t you guys get back to the books?&quot;  I point to where the kids are<br/>\n  sprawled &gt;on the floor, coloring huge maps of the world and putting stickers<br/>\n  on them with  pictures of famous landmarks ( the kids &gt;found the maps as<br/>\n  part of a kit in a Winners store).  &quot;Yes, but shouldn&#39;t you be talking to<br/>\n  them about maps and how they &gt;were invented, or about the politics of why<br/>\n  countries have borders, or how countries are named?<br/>\n  &gt;I mean, I understand doing things that the kids want to do, but shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n  you be making the connections between things for &gt;them?  Isn&#39;t that part of<br/>\n  why you are homeschooling in the first place, to get rid of jumping all<br/>\n  around without ever learning to &gt;see the big picture and how everything fits<br/>\n  together?&quot;  And in my heart, I felt he was right.  But when I start to do<br/>\n  those &gt;things, the kids listen politely for a bit, and then they just kind<br/>\n  of tune out after a while.  Are they still de-school-at-home-ing, &gt;or am I<br/>\n  still missing something here? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids do this too. In fact, whenever I start to doubt unschooling and<br/>\n  think I should be &quot;making&quot; them do something, I remember back to our 5 years<br/>\n  of attempting to do school-at-home, which were plainly miserable. Both of my<br/>\n  boys balk at my mere suggestion of doing ANYTHING resembling learning. They<br/>\n  have gotten way past the &quot;listening politely&quot; stage and tune out<br/>\n  immediately. I then remember how FAKE it feels to be *teaching* kids this<br/>\n  way. I mean, they don&#39;t want me tell them about how maps were invented or<br/>\n  why countries have borders unless they ask me why. And if I&#39;d tell them<br/>\n  without them asking, they would look at me like &quot;I don&#39;t care about that!&quot;<br/>\n  and I know it&#39;d just go in one ear and out the other. So, I still don&#39;t know<br/>\n  if they&#39;re deschooling (from school-at-home) or if it will just be like this<br/>\n  from now on!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;ve been reading some Paulo Freire, an educator in Brazil who decries<br/>\n  schools as they &gt;operate by what he calls the &gt;&quot;banking theory&quot; -- kid opens<br/>\n  head and teacher pours in knowledge.  He prefers to let the &gt;students talk<br/>\n  about what they &gt;know, and then gives them the proper terminology or<br/>\n  whatever else they are lacking for a full &gt;understanding.  But they don&#39;t<br/>\n  &gt;really ever ask me any questions about what they are doing -- they just<br/>\n  sort of do it.  They&#39;ll &gt;invite me to join in, but gently &gt;discourage my<br/>\n  attempts to help them name things.  Will they ever ask?  Or do I persist?<br/>\n  What &gt;has your experience been?   &gt;Debi  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve heard so much talk about early learning windows that will forever be<br/>\n  missed if kids aren&#39;t properly &quot;taught&quot; during those times and also stuff<br/>\n  like how it&#39;s so important to give kids challenges (like forced<br/>\n  memorization) to help develop and fire neurons in the brain, to increase<br/>\n  knowledge capacity and such. I know several moms who make their kids<br/>\n  memorize poems every week or even every day! One of my good friends is<br/>\n  teaching her 8 yo Latin! All I know that if I made my boys do such things, I<br/>\n  would never hear the end of their complaints. My boys like me to join in<br/>\n  with their activities, too, only to a certain point. If I stop being &quot;mom&quot;<br/>\n  and start being &quot;teacher&quot;, I&#39;m outta there. I&#39;ve been feeling frustrated<br/>\n  too, at times, but I&#39;m being to think this is how unschooling looks in our<br/>\n  family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Karin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!

For example, my dh said, they wouldn&#39;t have  learned cello and violin if you wouldn&#39;t have suggested it.  Or another example would be, if we were traveling somewhere and the kids didn&#39;t want to see a cathedral and would rather go play in an arcade they would miss out on a historical cathedral.  These are the questions I get alot of.  <br/>\nI think that me being who I am and the way my kids are we will find wonder where ever we go.

Thankfully, he doesn&#39;t do that to me and lets<br/>\nunschooling happen naturally. I&#39;m so lucky he &quot;gets&quot; unschooling. Instead, I<br/>\nhear conversations stressing the importance of making the kids &quot;do&quot; work<br/>\nover and over from the homeschool support group that we meet with weekly.<br/>\nMost if not all of the moms are into academics - in varying degrees. Some<br/>\nare strict pre-packaged curriculum users and others construct their own<br/>\ncurriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they do accept me as an unschooler, they ask me questions that I know<br/>\nmust concern them about how I&#39;m educating my boys. Today they asked me &quot;so<br/>\nwhat do you guys DO all day if you don&#39;t do schoolwork?&quot;. I was honest and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t think of a better answer and told them that the kids spend a lot of<br/>\ntime on the computer and how I don&#39;t mind that at all because I see them<br/>\nbeing challenged by these computer games all the time. They asked me &quot;and<br/>\nthey can watch TV whenever they want?&quot; and I said yes they can, but they&#39;ve<br/>\nreally self-regulated themselves and don&#39;t spend more than a couple hours a<br/>\nday watching TV - most days less. Well, I could tell I just wasn&#39;t<br/>\nconvincing them that this was the best way to go. I could almost hear their<br/>\nself-righteous mutterings to themselves like &quot;those poor boys won&#39;t amount<br/>\nto anything because Karin isn&#39;t giving them a proper education!&quot; Okay, they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t say that but I could just tell they were thinking it. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hmmmmm .... sort how I feel after trying to implement unschooling!!  I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thought I had settled the whole unschooling thing, and &gt;dh was a &quot;go&quot; for<br/>\nit, but today the questions started again.   &quot;Sooooo..... when are you going<br/>\nto start up with the kids?  I &gt;mean, you had a really good summer, but<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t you guys get back to the books?&quot;  I point to where the kids are<br/>\nsprawled &gt;on the floor, coloring huge maps of the world and putting stickers<br/>\non them with  pictures of famous landmarks ( the kids &gt;found the maps as<br/>\npart of a kit in a Winners store).  &quot;Yes, but shouldn&#39;t you be talking to<br/>\nthem about maps and how they &gt;were invented, or about the politics of why<br/>\ncountries have borders, or how countries are named?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I mean, I understand doing things that the kids want to do, but shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you be making the connections between things for &gt;them?  Isn&#39;t that part of<br/>\nwhy you are homeschooling in the first place, to get rid of jumping all<br/>\naround without ever learning to &gt;see the big picture and how everything fits<br/>\ntogether?&quot;  And in my heart, I felt he was right.  But when I start to do<br/>\nthose &gt;things, the kids listen politely for a bit, and then they just kind<br/>\nof tune out after a while.  Are they still de-school-at-home-ing, &gt;or am I<br/>\nstill missing something here? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do this too. In fact, whenever I start to doubt unschooling and<br/>\nthink I should be &quot;making&quot; them do something, I remember back to our 5 years<br/>\nof attempting to do school-at-home, which were plainly miserable. Both of my<br/>\nboys balk at my mere suggestion of doing ANYTHING resembling learning. They<br/>\nhave gotten way past the &quot;listening politely&quot; stage and tune out<br/>\nimmediately. I then remember how FAKE it feels to be *teaching* kids this<br/>\nway. I mean, they don&#39;t want me tell them about how maps were invented or<br/>\nwhy countries have borders unless they ask me why. And if I&#39;d tell them<br/>\nwithout them asking, they would look at me like &quot;I don&#39;t care about that!&quot;<br/>\nand I know it&#39;d just go in one ear and out the other. So, I still don&#39;t know<br/>\nif they&#39;re deschooling (from school-at-home) or if it will just be like this<br/>\nfrom now on!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been reading some Paulo Freire, an educator in Brazil who decries<br/>\n </span></blockquote>schools as they &gt;operate by what he calls the &gt;&quot;banking theory&quot; -- kid opens<br/>\nhead and teacher pours in knowledge.  He prefers to let the &gt;students talk<br/>\nabout what they &gt;know, and then gives them the proper terminology or<br/>\nwhatever else they are lacking for a full &gt;understanding.  But they don&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;really ever ask me any questions about what they are doing -- they just<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sort of do it.  They&#39;ll &gt;invite me to join in, but gently &gt;discourage my<br/>\nattempts to help them name things.  Will they ever ask?  Or do I persist?<br/>\nWhat &gt;has your experience been?   &gt;Debi  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard so much talk about early learning windows that will forever be<br/>\nmissed if kids aren&#39;t properly &quot;taught&quot; during those times and also stuff<br/>\nlike how it&#39;s so important to give kids challenges (like forced<br/>\nmemorization) to help develop and fire neurons in the brain, to increase<br/>\nknowledge capacity and such. I know several moms who make their kids<br/>\nmemorize poems every week or even every day! One of my good friends is<br/>\nteaching her 8 yo Latin! All I know that if I made my boys do such things, I<br/>\nwould never hear the end of their complaints. My boys like me to join in<br/>\nwith their activities, too, only to a certain point. If I stop being &quot;mom&quot;<br/>\nand start being &quot;teacher&quot;, I&#39;m outta there. I&#39;ve been feeling frustrated<br/>\ntoo, at times, but I&#39;m being to think this is how unschooling looks in our<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Frustrations","postDate":"1031774609","msgId":43730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEN0ZBMTkxLjc0RDM5OTdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGFsbzJoaytrOGZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43726,"nextInTopic":43737,"prevInTime":43729,"nextInTime":43731,"topicId":43713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** If you start lecturing kids about all kinds of things everytime they show an interest in something, they will be afraid to show an interest in much of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1763322927\">**<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you start lecturing kids about all kinds of things everytime they <br/>\nshow an interest in something, they will be afraid to show an <br/>\ninterest in much of anything.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThis &quot;lecture&quot; question is crossing in my mind with the Kama Sutra<br/>\nthread. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think next time your dh wants to have sex you should give him a<br/>\nlecture about the details of human physiology instead.
