Our family has gone  through <br/>\nquite a bit of trauma and upheavel in the weeks right before and after  the <br/>\nconference. Right before the conference, two close friends of our  family died, <br/>\none very suddenly and very young.  (Todd was the organist and  music director <br/>\nat the church I worked at for seven years. He played organ for  and attended <br/>\nour wedding in June.)<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter the conference I needed to go directly into work mode, as my work  year <br/>\nbegan the beginning of September, and I had mostly neglected prep because  of <br/>\nthe conference. (I work for a Unitarian Universalist church as Director of  <br/>\nReligious Education.)  I had made a bit of money with the  conference, which <br/>\nturned out to be good because Beth&#39;s organization had to make  budget cuts, and <br/>\neveryone in the organization will be going on four day work  weeks with 20% <br/>\nsalary reductions October through December.<br/>\n <br/>\nRight after the conference another very close friend, Daniel, who had just  <br/>\ndone one of the readings at our wedding, was admitted to the hospital with his  <br/>\nkidneys beginning to fail. He seemed to be getting better, but they were <br/>\nstill  trying to figure out what was going on with him. A couple of weeks ago he  <br/>\nentered a coma. The day after that our 17 year old cat, Charlotte, was  <br/>\ndiagnosed with terminal cancer.<br/>\n <br/>\nSaturday Charlotte died. Sunday, yet another friend (who&#39;d thrown our  <br/>\nwedding shower) was having heart pains and was admitted to the hospital. <br/>\n <br/>\nToday our friend Daniel died.<br/>\n <br/>\nBeth, Julian, and I are so raw right now. We wander around in a kind of  <br/>\ndaze, periodically just crying and falling into each other&#39;s arms. There is so  <br/>\nmuch death and sickness, and so much is so close to us.  We&#39;re planning a  <br/>\nvacation in a few weeks because we just need something good to look forward to.  <br/>\n(We&#39;re actually a little glad about Beth&#39;s furlough right now, because, despite  <br/>\nthe money issue, we just need her with us.)<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s us. With any luck at all things will be getting better very  <br/>\nsoon, and we&#39;ll be able to get things handled. In the meantime, please be  <br/>\npatient, and send us (and our family and friends) good energy and hugs.<br/>\n <br/>\nLove, Kathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99210,"nextTopicId":99751}}
