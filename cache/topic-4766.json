I am thinking <br/>\nof finishing my B.A. through Goddard&#39;s off campus program and then maybe even <br/>\ngoing for a Master&#39;s.  Their approach seems so much more sane and progressive <br/>\nand exciting. <br/>\n   I told my oldest about it and he thought it sounded interesting.  He&#39;s one <br/>\nwho is planning to go to college because the things he&#39;s interested in tend <br/>\nto require a degree but he and I are having a negative experience right now <br/>\nin a community college class we&#39;re taking together and it has made me <br/>\nquestion the whole approach.  I know most classes aren&#39;t as bad as this one <br/>\nbut I would hate for him or me to ever be in a class like this again.  It is <br/>\neverything I hate about institutional learning (learning for the grade and <br/>\nthe transcripts rather than the information, dealing with a power crazy <br/>\nauthoritarian teacher, etc.).   It has really put a damper on the subject for <br/>\nus both (Geology) because we associate it with that class and that teacher.  <br/>\nBefore this, I had had good experiences in college classes and found them to <br/>\nbe totally different than high school.  This was the last general ed. class I <br/>\nneeded for transfer or an A.A.<br/>\n     I also love the flexibility of the off-campus learning because it is <br/>\ndifficult for me to arrange for being on campus every week right now.  And <br/>\nGoddard&#39;s description of their degrees&#39; processes speaks of choosing the ways <br/>\nto learn each subject and working with a long-distance tutor to come up with <br/>\na plan.  <br/>\n     How do you like the Norwich program?  Is it similar?  Are you glad you <br/>\nchose it?  It sounds really interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"sara woodall","from":"sara woodall &lt;swoodall@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"C4cc2qGEIXtrWMpArKn5_AX32LAD5GnJ-G6ehPmOwPCbzhtW_FD8Tv5Q1HQwaQNKKpKVCs5CAR1ALQeJEMC9HtAT8g80GDakTIDP","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Goddard College","postDate":"943390814","msgId":4788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTEuNDc4OC45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4766,"nextInTopic":4810,"prevInTime":4787,"nextInTime":4789,"topicId":4766,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, Lucy.
