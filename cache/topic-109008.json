My dh has many concerns about our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s education, most of which we don&#39;t talk about much, without<br/>\ndistress on both our parts.  We are not the great communicators that<br/>\nso many unschooling parents seem to be on these lists.  In fact, my dh<br/>\nwould move us to another state if his job necessitated it, so he says.<br/>\n He would buy a new or new-used car if he wanted to, and while he<br/>\nmight like for me to appreciate it, it is his deal, not mine. However<br/>\nif I thought we needed one, he wouldn&#39;t buy one. (Both our cars are 15<br/>\nyears old, and running pretty well because of the endless amount of<br/>\nmaintenance he does on them)  I homeschooled the curriculum way for<br/>\nten years, with sorry results.  Coming back to unschooling has been<br/>\nhappening since January &#39;05...too soon for dh to see any great<br/>\nresults. (I&#39;m not sure if anything impresses him except for doing well<br/>\non standardized tests, ACT, SAT, etc. and so far the kids do well on<br/>\nthem until 6th grade, when they start falling behind, until the ACT<br/>\ncomes and then they are in the bottom 5%) He wasn&#39;t impressed with how<br/>\nour kids have done in our old way of homeschooling, but since that was<br/>\nclosest to what he thought of as &quot;school&quot;, he accepted it. If this<br/>\nsounds really depressing, sorry.  He is pretty hard on them, hard on<br/>\nme, and hard on himself. I personally feel badly for my oldest, who is<br/>\nnow trying to get into the Coast Guard, and will soon be taking the<br/>\nmilitary&#39;s test that determines where one can be placed, or accepted<br/>\nat all (the CG has the strictest admittance requirements for<br/>\nenlistees)...he seems to have no idea how to study for it, or for<br/>\nanything.  None or almost none of the math he struggled through in<br/>\nhome high school stuck, to his dismay, and his dad&#39;s almost dispair. I<br/>\nput in my bits of &quot;It (algebra) doesn&#39;t matter as much as you think&quot;,<br/>\nwhich he doesn&#39;t believe.  He (dh) believes you have to go along with<br/>\nwhat &quot;they&quot; say is required, in order to get along in life.  I used to<br/>\nbelieve that, but I don&#39;t anymore.  I think that doing what one loves<br/>\nto do, and what brings one joy is what will make one happy &<br/>\nsuccessful, and one&#39;s corner of the world a better place. Dh thinks<br/>\nthat&#39;s unrealistic.  So, as you all in unschooling land can see, dh &<br/>\nI have a lot to work on, and mean while, I want to let our children be<br/>\nfree to learn what they want, when they want.  I&#39;ve tried &quot;making&quot;<br/>\nthem learn stuff - it&#39;s what I did for years!  They, surprise, have<br/>\nforgotten almost all of it! Sorry if I went on and on and all over the<br/>\nplace as well.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109009,"nextTopicId":109023}}
