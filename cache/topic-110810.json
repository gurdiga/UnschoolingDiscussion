On Sunday, the preacher&#39;s wife <br/>\nhad her traditional basket o&#39; goodies there - she makes up little <br/>\npackets of Hershey&#39;s kisses, maybe a candy cane, other holiday type <br/>\ntreats and sets them in a basket near the door for each person to <br/>\ntake a packet. Nice holiday thing. DS got his little packet, I had <br/>\none, DH had one, many other people had one. A friend went to get one <br/>\nfor herself and found two boys (similar ages to DS) contemplating <br/>\nhow to grab as many as would fit in their pockets. She came back <br/>\nfrom that encounter and, casual jokingly (DS has known her since he <br/>\nwas about 18 months old) she asked DS for one of his candies. He <br/>\nloked in his packet and pulled out a Kiss and handed it to her and <br/>\nroamed off to munch the rest of his packet. No fuss no muss. She <br/>\ncommented on the contrast between the two who were trying to get as <br/>\nmuch as they could carry and DS who handed over a piece of candy <br/>\nwithout a whinge (and no requirement to either - he could have said <br/>\nNo if he chose). I said Well, he knows that if he wants more Kisses, <br/>\nand we&#39;ve got the funds in the budget, he can have as many more as <br/>\nhe wants.
