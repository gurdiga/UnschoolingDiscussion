So important to treasure our children&#39;s gifts and allow them the peace to enjoy them without requirements. At a young age I was told to either audition for Julliard or stop playing piano. I quit.  I hated performing.  Every recital was so anxiety producing! Fortunately I made my own rules for guitar and singing. I allow my children to decide what instruments they want to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarole in CT<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne isn&#39;t necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency.
