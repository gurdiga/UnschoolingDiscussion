I just shared something I heard and choose to<br/>\n believe and someone disagreed/reacted. I wasn&#39;t asking for anyone to agree<br/>\n with me. <br/>\n I am wondering why some people seem so afraid of disagreements. At least<br/>\n that is my projection here. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    It&#39;s interesting that you responded to me this way. I don&#39;t think of <br/>\nmyself as being afraid of disagreement, but maybe there&#39;s an element of that <br/>\nin me, so thanks. It just seems to me that religious beliefs are very <br/>\npersonal and often not connected to logic, mine included, and people often <br/>\nfeel very strongly about them. So I guess I was concerned that we not get too <br/>\ncaught up in this thread. On the other hand, if we can debate without <br/>\nalienating each other that&#39;s great.<br/>\n    We are members of a Hindu satsang and followers of a living woman saint <br/>\nfrom India. Of all the hs groups that are available to us in the SF Bay area <br/>\nwhere we live, 10 minutes from Berkeley, my youngest daughter, age 11, has <br/>\nchosen the mostly fundamentalist Christian one. She likes the classes they <br/>\nteach and the spiritual focus and is taking anatomy and English this <br/>\nsemester. Last year in the spring when we joined, I kept my mouth shut about <br/>\nmy religious differences. Since then, however, I found out that my friend <br/>\nwho&#39;s in the group had already told them. So they know and we are accepted <br/>\nand left alone. This is really good for me to be able to work with people who <br/>\nare so different. I feel that my daughter is learning about people. In some <br/>\nways we are very much like these folks and in some ways we are very <br/>\ndifferent. I wish I could have more discussions with them but mostly we seem <br/>\nto maintain a respectful silence. -Amalia-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"czuniga145@aol.com","from":"czuniga145@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QRZhyPoB_BWTYp42K8LuISG_xIriXb88IcgKqLZq61ixuFHMsVQvd2EFM0C4tHwUWRfwxnnuJJaz","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Jesus and Emotions and the stuff of life and Rules a...","postDate":"980399743","msgId":15362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI1LjYzNTMzYTcuMjdhMTEwN2ZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15375,"prevInTime":15361,"nextInTime":15363,"topicId":15362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/24/01 8:48:57 PM Pacific Standard Time, snmanns@attcanada.ca writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1887437213\">In a message dated 1/24/01 8:48:57 PM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snmanns@...\">snmanns@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I am wondering why some people seem so afraid of disagreements.
