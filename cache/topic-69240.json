But it&#39;s helpful<br/>\nto see the dynamics that lead up to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few people on this list who devote hours a day to helping people<br/>\nunschool. It&#39;s voluntary. No one makes us. We do it because we want to and<br/>\nlove to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of those hours many children&#39;s lives are more joyful and peaceful.<br/>\nThere are children in this world who are never going to be spanked again,<br/>\nwho will never be shamed for not doing their school work or keeping up with<br/>\ntheir peers, who are growing up free from the burden of living their lives<br/>\nto relieve false parental fears, because of the hours the volunteers put<br/>\ninto this list explaining unschooling and peaceful parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll because of the hours of a few people on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe work we do is akin to volunteering on a rape crisis line or family<br/>\ncounseling center. *Hours* each day. How many other people can say they too<br/>\nare volunteering hours out of every day doing work that changes hurting<br/>\nfamilies for the better?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many people can say they do even an hour a *week*?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is asking anyone to appreciate the hours involved but the volunteers<br/>\nwould appreciate not being treated as though what we do is nothing and no<br/>\nbig deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for someone to respond directly to one of those volunteers who probably<br/>\nspends the most time with:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We can help one child at a time, one person at a time.  We can be loving<br/>\n&gt; parents and give our children a wonderful upbringing and STILL have time to<br/>\n&gt; help those who need help along the way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If only one child is spared the suffering the is oft times described in the<br/>\n&gt; news media isn&#39;t it worth that one child&#39;s life to CARE?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We cannot sit in our peaceful little worlds and ignore the pain and suffering<br/>\n&gt; happening right outside our doorsteps.  Nor do we have to turn our backs on<br/>\n&gt; our children and families to make a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>how incredibly insulting is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s akin to some &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot; dismissing you with being &quot;just a<br/>\nmother&quot;. It&#39;s akin to a husband saying to a stay at home mom &quot;Yeah, but you<br/>\ndon&#39;t do anything all day.&quot; She shouldn&#39;t call him a &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot;.
