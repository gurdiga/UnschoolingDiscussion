My closet is that way too, which is where I got the idea. I didn t want to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2076333254\">Kirby has t-shirts folded on shelves, socks and underwear in baskets on  <br/>\nshelves.<br/>\nMy closet is that way too, which is where I got the idea. I didn&#39;t want to  <br/>\ntake the shelves out of my closet, so my few hanging clothes are in my <br/>\nhusband&#39;s  closet and mine is all shelves.   It works well in stores.<br/>\n <br/>\nHolly has some in drawers and some on shelves and a little bit  hanging.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMarty has drawers and a few hangers.  He turned his closet into a  &quot;computer <br/>\noffice.&quot;  He and his dad built a desk and shelves in there.   It was a wide <br/>\nshallow closet that lost its cheap folding doors long  ago.<br/>\n <br/>\nI fold the clothes and put them in a laundry basket in the room, and then  <br/>\nsay I need the basket back when I do.  Sometimes they&#39;ll live out of the  clean <br/>\nclothes basket for a day or two.  Or I&#39;ll put Marty&#39;s folded stuff on  the end <br/>\nof the couch he has right inside his room, and sometimes they stay there  <br/>\nuntil he uses them if he doesn&#39;t feel like putting them away.  Same with  Holly, <br/>\nI might put hers in a basket, or on the chest right inside her  room.  Holly <br/>\nalways puts hers away.  Marty usually.  Kirby... I&#39;m  more likely to put them <br/>\naway than he is.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have a laundry chute under the bathroom sink upstairs that falls right  <br/>\non/near the washing machine.  It&#39;s not convenient for Kirby, so his dirty  <br/>\nclothes get piled in the corner of his bathroom until he brings them down.   He&#39;s <br/>\nstarting to do his own laundry more.<br/>\n <br/>\nMarty and Holly shower in there, so they&#39;re most likely to drop clothes  <br/>\ndown.  And Marty&#39;s room is right near the laundry room, so he throws dirty  stuff <br/>\nout the door and around the corner, which is close.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106011,"nextTopicId":106014}}
