For example, I would have been perfectly happy <br/>\nletting Rachel drive at 14 and she wanted to at that point.  <br/>\nUnfortunately our state law is 16.

What she does in six more months is up to her. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that isn&#39;t really a good example of what I mean.  Maybe this is <br/>\nbetter, Jenni is allergic to milk.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve mentioned her <br/>\ndiet to her since she was 5.  Once she understood how milk made her <br/>\nfeel she took control of it.  She accepted the responsibility if she <br/>\ncheated and felt bad.  Rachel, whose allergy is corn, was also given <br/>\ncomplete control very early.  But she was not as comfortable with it. <br/>\n When she started taking out her bad reactions on the rest of the <br/>\nfamily, she lost the priviledge to choose for a while.  We <br/>\nperiodically let go several times and once she learned not to take it <br/>\nout on us, she kept the control all to herself.  Although, I can&#39;t <br/>\ncount how many times I&#39;ve asked her how much corn she had when she has <br/>\na headache - not nagging, just a reminder to think about it.  <br/>\nEventually, she will either grow out of the allergy or come to terms <br/>\nwith it and stop binging, I hope.<br/>\nI guess I could have let her keep eating it when she was 9 and just <br/>\nlet her have daily temper tantrums and rages and headaches.

The constant of <br/>\nunschooling, though, is that they are still each free to pursue their own <br/>\ninterests in their own way. The constant of unschooling is in *my* <br/>\nperception of their ability to learn. I&#39;m absolutely certain that they will <br/>\ndo it, and that they do NOT need a schoolish scope and sequence guideline to <br/>\nfollow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the parenting differences that come up also have to do with my kids&#39; <br/>\ndifferences. Conor tends toward depression. So if I see that his interests <br/>\nare leading him somewhere dark and potentially dangerous to his psyche, I&#39;ll <br/>\nstep in and try to suggest some equally appealing lighter alternatives. <br/>\nThat&#39;s just a part of caring and helping out someone you love.

In fact, NO child should be <br/>\ndenied what they need.

And people have <br/>\nsaid that, to them, it makes sense that unschoolers would be less controlling <br/>\nin those areas and I&#39;ve seen posts (and written posts) pointing out the <br/>\nbenefits (imo, obviously) of BEING less controlling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I never saw ANYBODY say that you can&#39;t unschool without relinquishing all <br/>\ncontrol over children&#39;s choices. I think you&#39;ve set up a straw man with this <br/>\nstatement. I do know that there are a few people who do believe in <br/>\nrelinquishing all &quot;control.&quot; That would be the &quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot; <br/>\nnoncoercive parenting crowd. But many people unschool - do not &quot;do school&quot; in <br/>\nany way, shape, or form - while still requiring chores, bedtimes, and/or <br/>\nlimiting television. They probably have all kinds of other ways they make <br/>\nchoices FOR their kids too. My kids must wear seat belts in the car. My kids <br/>\nare not allowed to eat in the bedrooms. My kids have chores to do on a <br/>\nregular basis. My kids have to share the computer with me &lt;G&gt;. They aren&#39;t <br/>\nordered around harshly  -  they help make the decisions, but there are times <br/>\nthat I have the final say. When we&#39;re running to catch an airplane and they <br/>\nwant to play just one more game on the PlayStation, I might say, &quot;No, you <br/>\nhave to turn it off now we have to leave now.&quot; I might tell them, &quot;Please <br/>\nhave the table cleared off before you leave today.&quot;  None of this has <br/>\nanything to do with our unschooling - it is just our parenting and the way <br/>\nour family has evolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are being respectful and thoughtful and considerate of how <br/>\nchildren really learn best and so they are LIKELY to be respectful and <br/>\nthoughtful and considerate of their children in general and to TRUST their <br/>\nkids much more than other parents do. So they are likely to be less <br/>\ncontrolling and less limiting. I, personally, think they are less likely to <br/>\nfeel the NEED to be those things because the kids are not being shaped by <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Those who have said their children have special needs (like food <br/>\n&gt; allergies, diabetes, mood disorders) say they are unschooling but that <br/>\n&gt; it does not look like the unschoolers in the first statement.<br/>\n&gt; And many here have said that you should put the control withthe child <br/>\n&gt; even in cases like diabetes, because that is the only way to unschool.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen anybody say that.
