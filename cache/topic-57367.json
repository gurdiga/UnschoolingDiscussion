Got a <br/>\nbunch of books on all the planets, out of the library, and in one of <br/>\nthem was an idea: Make a model of the solar system with the sun on <br/>\none wall, and the planets placed where they &quot;would be&quot; in your model. <br/>\nWe tried to do both the sizes and the distances of the sun and <br/>\nplanets to scale, but we&#39;d have had Pluto across the street, which <br/>\nsort of blew everyone&#39;s mind, OR Jupiter and Saturn&#39;s girth would <br/>\nhave had them overlapping. So, we made some guesstimates and some <br/>\nadjustments, and stuck our planets on the ceiling. Sun on the dining <br/>\nroom sliding glass door drape. Seven foot sun, btw.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the planets are up on the ceiling, and I&#39;m getting dinner <br/>\ntogether, and Robby is pretending to be on the various planets. <br/>\nSuddenly he says &quot;I&#39;m on Uranus&quot; and I totally lost it! You know, he <br/>\npronounced it Your Anus LOL and it was just too silly. We all were <br/>\nlaughing our heads off, as the food is making its way to the table. <br/>\nThen he changes his voice and says &quot;Now I&#39;m on Jupiter and this is <br/>\nwhat I sound like! You want to hear Uranus?&quot; same pronunciation. <br/>\nWell, I couldn&#39;t resist &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to hear from my anus, thank <br/>\nyou very much.&quot; My hubby made a fart noise...<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, is this a typical unschooling moment? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you know what? All that free-flowing language set us up for some <br/>\namazing dinner time conversation. I did insist we drop the &quot;anus&quot; <br/>\nstuff at the dinner table, though! L But that got us talking about <br/>\nwhat that planet is named after, if not a Roman God, and what each <br/>\nplanet&#39;s god stood for, and then Holst&#39;s &quot;The Planets&quot; into the tape <br/>\ndeck, and Abbie, who knows a lot of Greek mythology, mentioned the <br/>\nrape of Europa and now the kids know that Zeus made himself into a <br/>\nbull to kidnap Europa. <br/>\nWe tried to figure out if Holst got it right. Does that sound <br/>\nwarlike? Is Jupiter&#39;s music happy and grand and jovial and kinglike? <br/>\nIs Mercury fast music, and Venus sexy music? <br/>\n<br/>\nRobby, when he got up to get the salad dressing, had to change it <br/>\nfrom Plutonian salad dressing, into &quot;human salad dressing.&quot; which, <br/>\nwhen applied to potato skins, was another hilarious side-trek. Flayed <br/>\npotatoes, we called them. and then it was &quot;Flays Potato Chips. Bet <br/>\ncan&#39;t eat just one&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nRobby acted like an alien off and on the rest of the night, and I <br/>\nwent to bed early! what a day, what a night.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace, heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57395,"nextTopicId":57402}}
