Assuming they&#39;re not offering more than 1/3 off, that&#39;s some pretty  <br/>\nexpensive assistance.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Holly was five and we were hosting a weekly unschooling get-together a  <br/>\nfamily came by.  The dad was into unschooling.  The mom was half owner  of a <br/>\nnew Sylvan center (which she had added onto a kids&#39; gymnasium she had  bought). <br/>\n The family ended up separated and then divorced, but the kids  (two little <br/>\ngirls) liked Holly so she was in on the whole unfolding,  visiting at various <br/>\napartments and houses for six or seven years after, and was  invited to the <br/>\nmom&#39;s remarriage wedding etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTurns out the mom&#39;s interest in coming to our group was the hope of  <br/>\nrecruiting people for her Sylvan center.  A couple of times when Holly was  with her, <br/>\nshe &quot;let Holly have a lesson.&quot;  She really had zero confidence in  humans and <br/>\na lot of love for her potential business.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m sorry for the school culture that makes parents put time  and <br/>\nenergy into afterschool tutoring and pressure, when they could have done  better <br/>\nto have spent that time and money taking kids on overnight trips to the  next <br/>\nstate, or just BEING with them in relaxed and happy ways.   Poor kids and poor <br/>\nparents.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd I&#39;m reminded to be grateful for my own life in which the list of  <br/>\nquestions about confidence, report cards and struggle are not applicable.   Kirby <br/>\nstruggled some with his math class the first couple of weeks, but he chose  to be <br/>\nin it and it was tuition-free.  We paid for the books.  He kept  asking <br/>\nquestions in class and asked a few different people to explain this or  that their <br/>\nway, so he had more than one perspective.   Kids at school  are pretty much <br/>\ntrained away from doing that, and it&#39;s sad.  So they pay  &quot;professionals&quot; to try <br/>\na different outside insertion method.<br/>\n <br/>\nHooray, we don&#39;t need it!<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103926,"nextTopicId":104153}}
