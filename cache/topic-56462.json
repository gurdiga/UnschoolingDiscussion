And would I even be able to call myself a Christian anymore,<br/>\n&gt; because what would I know to be true about Christ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You call yourself a Christian because you believe Jesus to be the Christ,<br/>\nthe son of God.  That&#39;s all you need to know to be true about Christ to be<br/>\nChristian, and many people are faithful Christians without believing every<br/>\nword of the Bible to be literally true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ways that we receive information about the world.  Not all of<br/>\nit is from writing and books, some things you know because you have felt<br/>\nthem.  There is nothing written that tells you that you are in love with<br/>\nanother person; you simply know that because of how you feel.  In this way,<br/>\nif you have felt God&#39;s love, then you have certainty in your heart about<br/>\nwhat you believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of unschooling is letting our children learn by experience.  They can&#39;t<br/>\nread about fire being hot and understand without having experienced its<br/>\nheat.  No matter how many times we tell them about it, they won&#39;t get it.<br/>\nIf you have experienced God&#39;s presence in worship or prayer, then that<br/>\nconfirms what you believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if I don&#39;t take scripture to be literal, I still learn a lot about God<br/>\nfrom what the Bible tells me.  Here&#39;s a non-bibilcal example of that: the<br/>\nstory of George Washington chopping down the cherry tree and admitting to<br/>\nhis father that he did it.  This is not believed to be an historic event,<br/>\nbut it does reveal him as a man of integrity.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, one of the great scripture scholars, Raymond Brown, wrote the<br/>\nfollowing in reference to the two differing versions of the story of the<br/>\nNativity found in Matthew and Luke&#39;s gospels:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our Christmas pageants usually combine the two stories, but when biblical<br/>\nscholars attempt to reconcile the conflicting material they can&#39;t.  We might<br/>\ndo better to recognize that the Holy Spirit was content to give us two<br/>\ndifferent accounts and that the way to interpret them faithfully is to treat<br/>\nthem separately.  Not try to force a harmony out of some mistaken notion<br/>\nthat if scripture is inspired it has to be historical as well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI like that last sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda, <br/>\nwith help from dh, alan, who was actually in town this weekend</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56468,"nextTopicId":56137}}
