Extended family - maybe 25 <br/>\npeople at big table - done eating and just having pie. My bil tried to <br/>\ntake the lid off of some whipped cream - the kind in a canister that <br/>\nsprays out - it sort of exploded and whipped cream flew up - stuck on <br/>\nthe ceiling and also kind of sprayed all over people sitting near him. <br/>\nI got it in the face - more than anybody else. So I grabbed another can <br/>\nand pointed it at him and sprayed him back. I don&#39;t think the kids ever <br/>\nlaughed so hard in their lives as they joined in - it was self-limiting <br/>\nbecause we wanted the whipped cream for our pies and there were only a <br/>\nfew cans, but everybody who wanted to got at least one chance to spray <br/>\nsomebody. My bil died of leukemia a little over a year later - that was <br/>\nour last Thanksgiving together and that memory is just so precious to <br/>\nus all. He was a guy who had FAR more spontaneity than the rest of us <br/>\nand brought out the fun in us. Even now all these years later, we can <br/>\nbe kind of a serious family, but each of sometimes thinks, &quot;What would <br/>\nDes do?&quot; and then does some totally out of character wacky thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154422553,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"&quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; &lt;krisulam@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: food fight !!!","postDate":"1079917222","msgId":92151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PElORU5MQU5QUENKSEFJUE9NRklPRUVJRENFQUEua3Jpc3VsYW1AdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNzk4OTQ0MzcuNTkwLjUwMjU2Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":92170,"prevInTime":92150,"nextInTime":92152,"topicId":92151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on   Sun, 21 Mar 2004 18:11:52 -0000 Kathy said  ...

Do you really want to<br/>\npromote the wastefulness of a food fight?  Many people have<br/>\ndifficulties being able to afford to buy food to eat, let alone to<br/>\nuse it as a toy.  This might be a perfect opportunity to discuss<br/>\nwastefulness, and perhaps even to encourage a charitable donation to<br/>\na hunger center with the very foods that may have been used in the<br/>\nfood fight.  I may be a bit biased about this because of my<br/>\nupbringing, but my parents lived throught the Second World War in<br/>\nEurope and suffered from hunger, so from early on it was instilled in<br/>\nme that we do not waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a waste.  You could go on a shopping trip<br/>\nto find some foods that are so cheap that you could have a very satisfactory<br/>\nfood fight for a few dollars.  Since no one is eating it, the brand and<br/>\nflavor don&#39;t matter.  Jello, rice, old cereal from the pantry that no one<br/>\nate before it went stale.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, maybe spontaneity is what makes a good food fight and<br/>\nthis much planning kind of squelches it?  Find out what it is that intrigues<br/>\nyour kids about the Hollywood style food fight.  I remember my brothers and<br/>\nI used to fantasize about a pie fight like they had on the Brady bunch<br/>\nvacation episode.  We had a lot of fun trying to figure out if they wasted<br/>\nall those real pies or if they were just pie tins filled Redi-Whip.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my kids love it when serious people like my dh and I do something<br/>\nout of character and wacky (even I wish that sort of thing happened more<br/>\noften).<br/>\n<br/>\nYours truly<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92031,"nextTopicId":92172}}
