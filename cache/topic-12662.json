I&#39;m going to try it.  I&#39;m so afraid my ds<br/>\n will hurt himself when he goes into one of his &quot;out of control&quot;.  I&#39;ve tried<br/>\n holding him & talking to him softly but that takes so long.  I used to take<br/>\n 1-2 hours now 30-45 minutes.  But when the moment passes he&#39;s such a sweetie<br/>\n & like he doesn&#39;t know it ever happened.  Later he&#39;ll tell me he&#39;s having a<br/>\n really bad day.  I&#39;ve tried swats (through pants & only enough to feel) a<br/>\n few times but that doesn&#39;t work at all so it&#39;s been dropped.  But your idea<br/>\n of laying next to him & talking is worth a try.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;I will never forget Ali&#39;s first meltdown (my term)...it was scarey for us <br/>\n </span></blockquote>both....thrashing about and screaming....since then (over a yr ago and many <br/>\nmeltdowns since then) Ali and I are discovering prevention <br/>\ntechniques....watching for too much simulation, not enough sleep,  not enough <br/>\nhealthy food or too long in between snacks.....however even watching for <br/>\nthese is not a cure all.....when meltdowns happen....I sit on the floor and <br/>\ntalk in a low voice stating &quot;I understand you are having trouble getting <br/>\ncontol of yourself..I will sit here and when you need me I will be waiting <br/>\nfor you...with in minutes she is usually crawling on my lap, then I let her <br/>\ncry.  When the storm is calming with deep breathing we do together, we talk <br/>\nabout what led to the meltdown and try to fix whatever we can.... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat am I hopeful my little one is learning,.....when she is out of control I <br/>\nam here to help her, plus how to help herself by following my led (deep <br/>\nbreathing)....seems a little better that a swat on the bottom...<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12660,"nextTopicId":12667}}
