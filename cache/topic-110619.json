Thanks for the  inspiration.<br/>\n*****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Glad to send some inspiration to someone today. &lt;g&gt; As for my folks... well lets just say that losing them wasn&#39;t a hardship by any stretch. Not anything by any comparison to what so many others went through. The house they still have is way too much. Now my Dad acts as if he lost the world... There is a shanty town (for lack of a better word) down the road from them. (Way down the road, but when I heard about it, before I saw it, I thought it was right down the road, like next door down the road.) And my Dad has no compassion. The people there are living in fifth wheels. (campers that hitch to pick up trucks, nice but still not a home) And he has no compassion. He makes statements like *look what they get to live in! The government is spoiling these people, the way the government is supporting them is a step up from where they were living before...* and worse. When my sister pointed out his logic all he said was *but I lost the other two houses, you don&#39;t see me getting handouts.*<br/>\n I just shake my head. There is absolutely no sense arguing that kind of ignorance. He is a great grandpa, and he would give a stranger the shirt off his back, but the rest of us would hear about it and the way he would tell it you would think he gave the stranger a new wardrobe from Saks and shoes from Prada. So honestly don&#39;t feel bad. :o( <br/>\n  ~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227522899,"authorName":"camden","from":"camden &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt;","profile":"ccoutlaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Gift giving","postDate":"1134438316","msgId":110667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxOTcwMWM1ZmY4NiRmMTBhYmIwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBIT01FPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE0MS41MmMwZDVlNS4zMGNmNGRkYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":110664,"nextInTopic":110673,"prevInTime":110666,"nextInTime":110668,"topicId":110619,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"May I suggest some butt naked reindeer wearing some of the famous bunny ears ??

I am totally happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DS also plays GBA games, so my pokemon games are in one side and<br/>\nthe DS games are in the other and I am crazy happy to know it is in my<br/>\npocket whenever I am bored in a checkout line or waiting at the dr.&#39;s<br/>\nor waiting in the car until my DD gets off work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious what tops your kids&#39; wishlists?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris in IA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sarah, at 16, would love her own car (not happening on our budget this<br/>\nyear), but she might get her own set of keys to the cars we do have. <br/>\nShe is also getting a calligraphy set and a jewelry making tool kit,<br/>\nand a gift card to Michael&#39;s craft shop, her own copy of Animal<br/>\nCrossing DS so we can play together, and a furby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew, 14, is getting 6 new G.A.
