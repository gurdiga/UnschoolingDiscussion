Children, a subset of people, will try things that may<br/>\nnot be good for them, but will ultimately respond to the behavior modeled<br/>\naround them (most children; there are doubtless some who will not follow the<br/>\nmodel).  If you watch TV all day, they&#39;ll assume this is OK to do and will<br/>\nwant to do it too.  If you&#39;re involved in meaning and interesting stuff,<br/>\nthey&#39;ll want to participate with you in what you&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost children won&#39;t choose to sit at a desk, day after day, filling in<br/>\nworksheets.  Mine would choose to be outside running around, reading a book,<br/>\ncreating their own world and games with Legos and other toys, or playing on<br/>\ncomputer or video games.   They do learn from all these things.  Maybe they<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what year some war ended.  Maybe they don&#39;t know what happened at<br/>\nsome famous battle, or who invented penicillin.  If it becomes important to<br/>\nthem to know that, they&#39;ll learn it quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody makes mistakes.  Children, having less experience on which to base<br/>\ntheir decisions, might be expected to make more mistakes; having parents<br/>\nclose by to model good decision-making is what lets so many of them survive<br/>\n&lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\npsam<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psamo@...\">psamo@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMotherhood - not just a job, it&#39;s an Adventure!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"joanna514","from":"&quot;joanna514&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: On good choices","postDate":"1013267027","msgId":31970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE0M2RvaityaHZtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzZGUwMWMxYjE2NSRkODE4YzYwMCQ3NmNlMDdjNEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":31963,"nextInTopic":31972,"prevInTime":31969,"nextInTime":31971,"topicId":31963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... parents seem ... always seem ... interests. ... instance. ... saying ...

The only choices my kids <br/>\nmake, that I sometimes have problems with, is dealing with other kids <br/>\nor their siblings.  They aren&#39;t always kind.  They sometimes hurt <br/>\nfeelings, and we talk about it, and I usually find, someone <br/>\nembarrassed another, or wasn&#39;t playing fair, or was just being grumpy.<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m grumpy and don&#39;t handle it all well, but we ALWAYS come <br/>\nback to it later, and we discuss it again, and talk about other ways <br/>\nof handling things(even for me) and we forgive ourselves and each <br/>\nother for being grumpy, and not making the right choices.<br/>\nI do think some people have easy going kids, and make it all sound a <br/>\nlittle unrealistic, esp. when applying it to my life.  My kids have <br/>\nlots of energy and lots of passion.  That&#39;s not easy to control for a <br/>\nlittle kid.  It&#39;s not always easy to control for me!<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":29255176,"authorName":"ECHSA","from":"&quot;ECHSA&quot; &lt;echsa@...&gt;","profile":"cathykoetsier","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"On good choices","postDate":"1013195478","msgId":31963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZGUwMWMxYjE2NSRkODE4YzYwMCQ3NmNlMDdjNEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGEzNDZ2YytycGczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31970,"prevInTime":31962,"nextInTime":31964,"topicId":31963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Reading this:  As I said in my previous post, many unschooling parents seem to have children who don t struggle with choice.
