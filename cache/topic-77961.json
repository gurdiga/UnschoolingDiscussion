Where we used to live there was a game group that met at the library.  We went every week.  My daughter makes friends everywhere we go, but my son has a harder time.  He prefers the older kids to kids his own age.  I think the difference between a game/play group held in a public place and setting up a playdate in someone&#39;s house is that when you are in a public place with a group of people your kids have the opportunity to leave, while in someone&#39;s house they&#39;re kind of stuck there.  I think that&#39;s the part that&#39;s making me squeamish.  I would rather the kids meet in a public place where they don&#39;t feel forced to be friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154033277,"authorName":"Crystal","from":"&quot;Crystal&quot; &lt;crystal.pina@...&gt;","profile":"crystalinma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] is unschooling perfect?","postDate":"1060174543","msgId":78009,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGMwMWMzNWMxYSQwYzE5YWMyMCRiYWVhZmVhOUBTRVlNT1VSQlVUVFM+","referencesHeader":"PE5IQkJKQklMQUxHRE5NR0dETkxIQUVGQkRBQUEubmFsaWVkZWxAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":78006,"nextInTopic":78010,"prevInTime":78008,"nextInTime":78010,"topicId":77961,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=Remember when you were 13?=- I hated being 13!

Unless they are 15 or 16 they can&#39;t <br/>\ndrive anywhere.  I know we don&#39;t go to church so there aren&#39;t any friends that <br/>\nway.  We live on 12 acres not in a housing development.  We do get out to do <br/>\nerrands, etc., but most children are in school, not out with their parents doing <br/>\nerrands.  If I didn&#39;t take my child to play group they would not have developed <br/>\nfriendships.  And they don&#39;t develop true friendships with everyone.  The <br/>\nones that they seem to click with they say so and we arrange to do things with <br/>\nthem.  They do play with everyone.  Putting children together does not mean that <br/>\nthey have to form friendships with everyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think for that age you could set up some sort of a bike day type of thing <br/>\nso that older children, preteen, teen, could bring bikes, roller blades, etc., <br/>\nand get together.  That way they wouldn&#39;t have to just sit and stare at each <br/>\nother they could bike.  Maybe bring a basketball or soccer ball and see if they <br/>\nwant to get a game going.  That way they are playing together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the unschooling conference last year I think all the ages of children were <br/>\nable to make friends and play or talk together.  Some were more quiet than <br/>\nothers but it was refreshing to see children that were so outgoing.  You may be <br/>\nsurprised.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it may be easier for adults although that is not always the case.  I <br/>\nknow my best friend has a hard time making friends, her job provides a little <br/>\nof that.  But I did get her a museum membership for Christmas which allows her <br/>\nto go to the openings etc and she meets interesting people there.  I set her <br/>\nup.

Trevor says he&#39;s missing out on some social stuff and that&#39;s it. He&#39;s 13 and really needing to be with peers more lately, but we seem unable to meet his needs entirely. Mainly because I&#39;m working a lot lately, but that will change next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that it is difficult to balance everyone&#39;s priorities sometimes. I know the two little ones need me to read, play and do tactile stuff with them. My oldest would like to be out and about doing things with other people more. Second oldest ds would like more one on one attention. But that&#39;s not about unschooling really, in the sense that these issues would exist regardless....actually, MORE so if they were in school. Trevor would get his social needs met, but he&#39;d also deal with the BS that he has NO desire to face. So it&#39;s not worth it, even to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that I don&#39;t get to my passions/interests nearly as often as I&#39;d like. I don&#39;t get the solitude I crave in order to be creative. But I also know that it is a short term thing...mostly has to do with having a toddler!  I think that with unschooling the parents DO have to juggle their interests a bit more, because everyone&#39;s interests are of equal value. But why would I want to change THAT? :) yk?<br/>\nI could be like other parents that don&#39;t value their children&#39;s interests and STILL don&#39;t seem to have passions of their own....<br/>\nSo I see that any challenges faced with unschooling are actually positives when you view the other options. <br/>\nI like that my children&#39;s interests are high priority. I see the genius in them flourishing and that makes everything totally worth it.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have children so I could put myself first all the time anyway, I just have to remind myself of that after a long day of go, go, go and a bed full of people and NO time to myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, unschooling IS perfect. The challenges have encouraged me to grow and proven that it&#39;s the ultimate environment to foster creativity and brain growth!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the list Stephanie...great question for discussion!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion]Shyrley and the conference (was   is unschooling perfect?)","postDate":"1060106886","msgId":77973,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDAzMDgwNTA4MTgxNi4wMWY1YjU2MEBtYWlsLmdhaWF3b2xmLm9yZz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNGMkZCRTAwLjcwNTA3MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDFlOS5lNTFjYmNlLjJjNjExNTUwQGFvbC5jb20+IDwxZTkuZTUxY2JjZS4yYzYxMTU1MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77968,"nextInTopic":77974,"prevInTime":77972,"nextInTime":77974,"topicId":77961,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey, Shyrley, are you still into Liam and me stopping at your place on the way down to the conference?
