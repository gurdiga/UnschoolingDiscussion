My name is Cathy and I have two boys at home and two <br/>\ngrown up children.  I was wondering if any of you are from NY state.  This <br/>\nstate is a bit difficult to be an unschooler in, not only in it&#39;s ridiculous <br/>\nreporting requirements but with other homeschoolers that school their kids at <br/>\nhome.  For example there was an article in the paper recently about homeschooling <br/>\nprofiling a family that&#39;s children work from dawn to dusk on their studies.  <br/>\nMight as well send them to school I think if you are going to homeschool like <br/>\nthat.  My philosophy is that life is education and you can learn whatever you <br/>\nreally want to learn.  Consequently one of my sons is learning all this stuff <br/>\non the computer, photoshop, Bryce, etc. etc,  making his own movies and <br/>\nanimations, designing etc, because he wants to.  He also got into clay modeling and <br/>\nhas built his own tire swing  and the other one is fascinated with snails that <br/>\nhe found in the backyard that are laying eggs.  You guys know the drill, chi<br/>\nldren love to learn.  But I live in this state where it seems that homeschoolers <br/>\nare obsessed with doing school at home.  So I am always the oddball, always <br/>\nbeing creative in my quarterly reports, and consequently have children that <br/>\nthink  and respond from their own inner persons and not the exterior motivations <br/>\nthat most want their children to operate from.  I am also a Christian which <br/>\nmakes me an oddball Christian too, but I think Jesus was the original <br/>\nunschooling model and that most Christians operate from rules and not grace.  Anyway, <br/>\nare any of you from this state?<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73006,"nextTopicId":73024}}
