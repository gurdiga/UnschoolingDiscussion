He wrote reports that required simple language.  He advocated schools make Shakespeare and algebra optional for those who delighted in it only.  Huge-o waste of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to him, Math and English are over-blown in school, and he had his kids find one subject they loved at school to excel in and they could get bare passes in all others - delight driven but unfortunately still in the system.  As a parent he told the finger-wagging Math and English teachers to take a hike, which made me giggle.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thots.<br/>\n<br/>\nTim Thomas<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandradodd@...\">sandradodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, May 11, 2003 7:59 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new to the list<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 5/11/03 7:08:33 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hitekmom@...\">hitekmom@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Don&#39;t yell at me, but probably our first year will be 20% teaching (from <br/>\n  Math, Bible readers, and English text) and 80% unschooling.
