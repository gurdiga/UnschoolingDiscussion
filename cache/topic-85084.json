It doesn&#39;t last forever. <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan didn&#39;t want to sleep alone when he was eight either.   We moved<br/>\ninto this house when he was seven.  The bedroom is a small, open loft<br/>\nupstairs and he was still regularly sleeping with us at the time.  He<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t go to bed without one of us.   He thought big prehistoric birds<br/>\nwould come out of the walls and peck him.  <br/>\nThat idea stirred in him, I think, because that summer we had a Starling<br/>\nwiggle through the vent and nest in our attic. We could hear her and her<br/>\nchicks peeping and scrambling around. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think he was ten before he was really comfortable with the idea of<br/>\nbeing asleep upstairs without someone else up there.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I know he is very miserable and wants to sleep. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got one of those little kid tents, just big enough for a mat and<br/>\nlittle nest of blankets and put it in the living room in the evening. <br/>\nWhen he was feeling sleepy he would go in there and it was cozy and he<br/>\ncould watch TV until he fell asleep.   We&#39;d wake him when we went up to<br/>\nbed.   Sometimes he&#39;d just sleep on the sofa until we all went upstairs,<br/>\nbut he did like having the little tent, and I think it helped him get<br/>\nused to being alone without really being alone.  And those little tents<br/>\npop up or down so fast it doesn&#39;t have to be up in the daytime if it&#39;s in<br/>\nthe way. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe can sleep anywhere these days.  He has his own bed upstairs and can be<br/>\nup there, and even in the little rooms under the eves by himself, without<br/>\nbeing afraid. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I don&#39;t want to be mean I want to be understanding and help him<br/>\nthrough this.*** <br/>\n<br/>\nWe know that! &lt;g&gt;  And he doesn&#39;t want to be afraid, or have you<br/>\nfrustrated with him.  He really can&#39;t help it.  Finding a place where he<br/>\nfeels safe and can fall asleep will make you both feel better. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow is your arm these days?
