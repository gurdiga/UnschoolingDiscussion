I thought after I wrote that post.. about &quot; <br/>\neveything they done for us was out of love&quot; and  yeah, thats true.. what they <br/>\ndone FOR US... But, my dad was (is) an alcholic and that certainly wasnt a <br/>\ngood role model.  He is a great man and his character and good qualities far <br/>\noutweigh his flaws.. ANd my mom is so great, she really helpled balance out <br/>\nthe &quot;yucky stuff&quot; with dads alcoholism.  Dad was never abusive or &quot;lazy&quot;.. he <br/>\nalways worked hard and provided for his family.   He just liked to drink and <br/>\nhave a good time.  ( still, not acceptable, to the extent that he did it)  In <br/>\nthat respect, I vowed to never drink in excess nor to marry a man that <br/>\nremotely had any of the flaws that my dad did.   My husband does not drink, <br/>\ngamble, hunt and fish excessively.. and lots of the other things that I felt <br/>\nmy dad did to the detriment of his family.  But, my dad also has qualities <br/>\nthat my husband lacks.   Still, all in all, I do count myself  and my family <br/>\nblessed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128897139,"authorName":"love-it-here@juno.com","from":"love-it-here@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]  My dear Grandpa.","postDate":"1044471965","msgId":57968,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMjA1LjE0MDYxMC4tMjcyNjM5LjIubG92ZS1pdC1oZXJlQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57936,"nextInTopic":57971,"prevInTime":57967,"nextInTime":57969,"topicId":57936,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... knees ...

I know this is pretty intense ( and <br/>\nprobably not uncommon)  but when he died, Grandma fell to her knees and <br/>\nbegged God to take her too.  She REALLY, wanted to die before Grandpa.   I <br/>\nthink Grandpa held on for months because he knew how his death with affect <br/>\nGrandma.    Its sad.. but, its also wonderful to remember Grandpa and know, <br/>\ntruely, sincerely KNOW that he was the nearest to perfect man that he could <br/>\nhave possibly been.   I know when folks die, all the accolades and testimony <br/>\ncome out professing how great the person was ( and most folks are).. But, <br/>\nwith my Grandpa...well, he REALLY was one of a kind.   Of all the people I <br/>\nknow, I cant think of anyone as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;real&quot; as my Grandpa.   My moms a <br/>\nclose second though :-)   She inherited Grandpas wonderful spirit and kind, <br/>\ngentle ways.. and his sense of fun too.

If  I could be half the mother that my mother is... <br/>\nwell, I&#39;de be a damn good mother.   One thing that mom said during the <br/>\n&quot;family viewing&quot; .. she was crying and hugged me and my sisters.. she said.. <br/>\n&quot;he was the best daddy in the world. . the VERY best daddy anyone could dream <br/>\nof.. I just wish everyone could have a daddy like mine&quot;   My sister <br/>\nsaid...&quot;your the best momma in the world, we&#39;re lucky to have you&quot;  Mom <br/>\nsaid.. &quot;well, anything good in me came from my daddy&quot;. I know my Momma is <br/>\ngood and wonderful in her own right, but, no one can deny what influence a <br/>\nparent has on a child.  Some of it &quot;modeling&#39; and some of it genetic. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see a lot of family estrangement on this list.  A lot of complaining and <br/>\npain from the past.  I know that a lot of folks came this way because of <br/>\nwanting to be &quot;better&quot; than thier parents.   Lots of parents have failed <br/>\nthier children.. mistreated them.. disrespected them.. and those children <br/>\nhave ended up &quot;here&quot;  looking for a better way to raise thier children.   <br/>\nI&#39;ve been extremely fortunate and blessed to have had a wonderful family that <br/>\nI can not find fault with.. Even if they did make me wash the dishes and come <br/>\nhome by midnight :-)  And, Ive got a spanking or two in my life.    I never <br/>\ndoubted for one  minute ANYTHING my parents did was out of love.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57970,"nextTopicId":57961}}
