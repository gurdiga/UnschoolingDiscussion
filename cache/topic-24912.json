It is indeed unschooling.  There is no curriculum and<br/>\nthey select what to do and when as long as it meets my basic standards of<br/>\nHOW MUCH.  For example, they have to write (physically) a certain amount<br/>\neach week.  They choose what and when.  If they want to write jokes or a<br/>\nterm paper it&#39;s fine by me as long as they write something.  These<br/>\n&#39;rules&#39; have come about because THEY asked for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they wanted the &quot;rules&quot; and later decide not to comply with &quot;rules&quot; that<br/>\nTHEY asked for, why are there consequences to that?  Maybe they feel that<br/>\nthey don&#39;t need the rules?  Maybe what prompted setting the rules isn&#39;t<br/>\nimportant to them anymore?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter tells me constantly that she has &quot;rules&quot; for her candy treats<br/>\n(those she gets from parties, halloween, Christmas stocking, trip to the<br/>\nstore, etc) like &quot;I&#39;m only going to eat one piece a day until my birthday,<br/>\n&#39;cause then I&#39;ll get more.&quot;  I don&#39;t feel a need to impose a consequence if<br/>\nshe suddenly decides to eat the whole lot of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that your kids are older and want to set some educational goals<br/>\nfor themselves.  But their motivation has to come from within to achieve<br/>\nthose, not from rules they set for themselves that are enforced by<br/>\nconsequences from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving them meet &quot;your basic standards&quot; in their learning is not what is<br/>\nmeant by the term unschooling.  You sound like a very relaxed homeschooler<br/>\nand a good parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people on this list carry the unschooling concept over into<br/>\nparenting, whereas others are totally unschooling in the learning department<br/>\nbut have other family standards (set bedtimes, mealtimes, chore lists,<br/>\nconsequences for family rules being broken, etc.).  Those for whom<br/>\nunschooling is also their total lifestyle are NOT by any means &quot;unparenting&quot;<br/>\nor letting their kids run wild to squish bread, trample the neighbors<br/>\nflowerbeds, etc.  The line between unschooling and parenting is kind of<br/>\nfuzzy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet, mom to Caroline, almost 7!! and Thomas, 3</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24909,"nextTopicId":24917}}
