I’d <br/>\nlike to give as many homeschoolers as possible a chance to submit their <br/>\nwriting/artwork for publication.  I homeschooled our two boys and now live on the <br/>\ncoast of New Jersey with my husband in an empty nest! I have had an idea for a <br/>\nbook for years and am finally pulling it all together!  The book will be a <br/>\nbeautiful one; I have found nothing similar in my search of books already <br/>\npublished.  It will show everyone just how incredibly creative and talented our <br/>\nhomeschoolers are.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks very <br/>\nmuch.  Kate Jennings<br/>\n <br/>\nAnnouncement –<br/>\nMy name is Kate Jennings, and I homeschooled our two sons for eight years, <br/>\nnot  counting  the  years  from  birth  to  age  six!   I am compiling writings <br/>\nby homeschoolers that will show the world just how talented we are!  I am <br/>\naccepting (very) short stories, essays/paragraphs (creative or instructive), diary <br/>\nentries, poems, letters to and from family or friends, etc.   Photos and <br/>\ndrawings that tie in with the writing would be great -- really, really great. The <br/>\nbook will be a showcase of the talents that homeschooled students possess.  <br/>\nAnything written by students would be appropriate, whether it is descriptive, <br/>\ninstructive or creative.  Please keep in mind my plea for accompanying artwork <br/>\n-- photos or sketches that relate to the written submission.  The presentation <br/>\nof the writing in the book is very, very important to me, and accompanying <br/>\nartwork is very important to the presentation!   One of my favorite submissions <br/>\nis from a boy whose family built their own home.  A photo and a sketch were <br/>\nincluded in the submission.  This entry will be most effective!
