We have been sick, one at a time and sometimes all four <br/>\ntogether, for 10 days now.  It&#39;s exhausting.  You&#39;ll get through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd both my kids watched PBS all day yesterday, when they weren&#39;t sleeping.  <br/>\nThe three of us spend the day in our bed, watching tv, sleeping, coughing, <br/>\nshivering and doing lots of snuggling.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday the kids are slightly better.  They got dressed for the first time in <br/>\nprobably a week (except that sometimes my son would wear his sequined cape <br/>\nover his pjs) and have gone up and down the stairs a couple of times.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re not interested in PBS today.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of days ago someone mentioned being annoyed by Sagwa on PBS.  Can I <br/>\njust say how annoying I find Arthur to be?  He&#39;s always in fear of being <br/>\nshamed at school by his friends.  I was probably just easily annoyed, even <br/>\nSesame street was getting on my nerves.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2995","postDate":"1044468958","msgId":57961,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNjcxMzM2LjFEOTAlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDQ0NTU3MzMuMzQyMC42MjU2MC5tMUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":57976,"prevInTime":57960,"nextInTime":57962,"topicId":57961,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
