As long as the expenses<br/>\nof public schooling are borne by the taxpayers, those funds must also be<br/>\nmade available to parents/guardians for use in the educational program of<br/>\ntheir choice whether that be public schools, charter schools, private<br/>\nschools, or homeschools. Instruction should be by persons who are approved<br/>\nby the appropriate parent or guardian, and a curriculum approved by the<br/>\nparent or guardian should be used.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Network also believes that public-schooled students should not<br/>\nparticipate in any extracurricular activities that are not open to all<br/>\nstudents. Extracurricular programs paid for by the taxpayers must be open to<br/>\nall residents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Network further believes that local homeschool parents should have the<br/>\nauthority to determine grade placement and/or credits earned toward<br/>\ngraduation for students entering or re-entering a homeschool setting from a<br/>\npublic school setting.3 (1988, 2000)<br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\n1) Public school programs artificially segregate children by age and require<br/>\nseating at desks set in rows. This does not permit a normal social<br/>\ninteraction with other children or adults such as may occur in everyday life<br/>\noutside of a school setting. The low number of adults encountered in the<br/>\npublic school setting provides little opportunity for children to see the<br/>\nmodeling of appropriate social behaviors and they are thus more likely to<br/>\nsee only the behaviors of other children their own age without an<br/>\nappropriate social context.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, public schools cannot provide the customized, extensive and<br/>\nflexible curriculum available to the homeschool. The public school setting<br/>\nartificially schedules learning and segregates it into separate subjects<br/>\nwith a limited amount of allocated time per day. This limits activities to<br/>\nwhat can fit the allocated time slot and to what can easily be classified as<br/>\nrelated to a particular subject. The predetermined schedule also means that<br/>\nmany children will either not have enough time to master the material before<br/>\nmoving on, or will have to waste time on material they have already mastered<br/>\nbefore moving on.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Parents have a compelling interest in the education of their children and<br/>\nshould therefore be able to determine the requirements that must be met when<br/>\ntheir children are educated in public school.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Test scores and evaluations from public schools may not be accurate<br/>\nindicators of knowledge or proficiency and are often of little value in<br/>\ndetermining grade placement or credits for a homeschool setting. The scores<br/>\noften reflect only the ability to memorize material long enough to complete<br/>\na test, and the skill set being evaluated is often limited. Therefore, the<br/>\nNetwork recommends that the initial months of homeschooling a former public<br/>\nschool student be used primarily to explore the interests and abilities of<br/>\nthe student while allowing the family to adapt to the challenges of the<br/>\nindependence and integration of the flexible and multi-disciplinary<br/>\nenvironment of homeschooling which can provide hands-on, &quot;real world&quot;<br/>\nactivities not available in public school settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright Â© 2000, The Family Unschoolers Network www.unschooling.org<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above may be reprinted freely as long as it is used in its entirety and<br/>\nincludes this note.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12982,"nextTopicId":13062}}
