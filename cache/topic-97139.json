What do you do with a child<br/>\nwho is insitent on being the center of attention?  To the point that the<br/>\nchild gets in your face if you are conversing with someone else.  It does<br/>\nnot seem to matter quantity of time you spend with this child but as soon as<br/>\nyou turn your attention away from this child, the child becomes immediately<br/>\nunruly, loud and gets right in your face.

To be honest I am always<br/>\nreluctant to make suggestions to third parties like this. You say &quot;the<br/>\nparents&quot; so it is not you, your child, with your personal and intimate<br/>\nknowledge of the whole story. That makes it harder to help.

There are unschooling families who use what my <br/>\nfriend calls &quot;cultural methods&quot; of responding to undesirable behaviors <br/>\nin their children. He means they spank, yell, isolate, shame, and take <br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, unschooling always involves trust in children - in fact, <br/>\ntrusting them to know, ultimately, what to learn, how to learn, when to <br/>\nlearn anything and everything. Parents offer information and <br/>\nexperiences. Parents offer guidance. Parents offer help. But <br/>\nunschooling parents don&#39;t offer to think &quot;for&quot; their children. All this <br/>\ntrusting children to think and choose when, what, and how to learn, for <br/>\nthemselves, tends to be extended, over time, into all areas of life, <br/>\nincluding things like chores and behavior, and is not limited to just <br/>\nconventional school subject areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers have adopted a belief that children naturally want to <br/>\nbecome part of the full society, in their own way, of course. <br/>\nPunishment tends to just fade from existence in the unschooling family <br/>\nbecause parents get into the habit of being &quot;helpers&quot; and of trying to <br/>\nunderstand what their kids&#39; motivations are for what they are doing. <br/>\nWhen parents understand motivation and are in the habit of looking for <br/>\nways to help - they eventually stop seeing punishment as useful. <br/>\nInstead, their focus become trying to help the child clarify and <br/>\nachieve his or her real goals. This is just turning the same attitude <br/>\nand approach we have, as unschoolers, on &quot;learning,&quot; onto other kinds <br/>\nof learning (learning to be courteous, learning when to be quiet, <br/>\nlearning to clean up after oneself, learning to share, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, if you observed a hundred unschooling families, you&#39;d see <br/>\na wide variation in how parents and children interact. We have <br/>\ndifferent personalities and we have different capabilities and <br/>\ndifferent life situations. Some have chosen to &quot;unschool&quot; in the most <br/>\nnarrow sense of the word - these families see that children don&#39;t need <br/>\nschoolwork in order to learn.  Instead, they provide lots of <br/>\ninteresting experiences and they pay attention to what catches the <br/>\nchild&#39;s interest and they follow up on those experiences in ways that <br/>\nthey&#39;ve observed are useful to the child. For example, they might go to <br/>\nan arboretum as a family outing. They notice that their son really <br/>\nlikes the carnivorous plants. When they go through the arboretum shop - <br/>\nthere are some small carnivorous plants for sale - so they buy one to <br/>\ntake home. They parent looks up carnivorous plants on the internet and <br/>\nshares some of what she learned, with her son. He asks, &quot;Wow, how did <br/>\nyou find that out?&quot; She shows him how to use Google. He thinks of other <br/>\nthings he could look up. Decides to look up &quot;Robot&quot; and finds a listing <br/>\nfor &quot;I, Robot,&quot; by Isaac Asimov. He says, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that was a <br/>\nbook - I just thought it was a movie.&quot; Next time they go to the <br/>\nlibrary, mom finds &quot;I, Robot&quot; and he reads it and loves it and wants to <br/>\nread more of Isaac Asimov&#39;s books. Mom also finds a book about Isaac <br/>\nAsimov. She doesn&#39;t think her son will want to read the whole book - <br/>\nbut she reads it and shares tidbits with him that she thinks are <br/>\ninteresting.  And so on.... Sounds like an unschooler, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, this could be a family with punishments for <br/>\nmisbehavior, with chore charts and bedtimes and 1 hour per day limits <br/>\non tv or video games and so on. But, over time, they&#39;re likely to <br/>\nchange that as they come to trust their children more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think these other parenting issues are &quot;part and parcel&quot; of <br/>\nunschooling. But they tend to often be natural outgrowths of <br/>\nunschooling. And examining them and analyzing what sense they make for <br/>\nour own famlies, questioning our own parenting choices, can help us <br/>\ncreate the kind of family life that is most conducive to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To parents I say, above all else, don&#39;t let your home become some <br/>\nterrible miniature copy of the school.  No  lesson plans!  No quizzes!  <br/>\nNo tests!  No report cards! Even leaving your kids alone would be <br/>\nbetter; at least they could figure out some things on their own.  Live <br/>\ntogether, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much as you can.&quot;<br/>\nJohn Holt in &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Punishment...","postDate":"1091374826","msgId":97155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWM0NzdkZCRkZGYzM2Q4MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGEzLjVmN2M0OTFhLjJlM2U2MGY5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97150,"nextInTopic":97158,"prevInTime":97154,"nextInTime":97156,"topicId":97139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1182136194\">From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But the way it works out is that very often when one person sees another<br/>\nvoluntarily taking out the trash, he<br/>\nor she will get a bag and replace it kind of out of gratitude that the trash<br/>\nis being taken out.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is in charge of the trash.

We have some expectations and <br/>\npracticalities, like if someone takes the trash out they should replace the bag.  If they <br/>\nuse the last of the milk, they should get another gallon from the back fridge <br/>\n(where we store quantities/extras of things).  But the way it works out is that <br/>\nvery often when one person sees another voluntarily taking out the trash, he <br/>\nor she will get a bag and replace it kind of out of gratitude that the trash is <br/>\nbeing taken out.  And with milk, if there are several people around when the <br/>\nmilk&#39;s about to empty out, one will say &quot;I&#39;ll go get milk,&quot; and regular <br/>\nguest-kids know where it is, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no &quot;contrary&quot; involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby&#39;s deal with us has been for years that we should know where he is, so <br/>\nhe will call or e-mail if he&#39;s going to be out all night.  He calls if he&#39;s <br/>\nchanging locations.   If he forgets (a time or two he has, but just forgetting, <br/>\nnot being sneaky or anything) that&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never wanted to &quot;ground&quot; any kids.  Much of their learning takes place <br/>\nout and about.  And we&#39;ve never wanted to make their rooms a place to avoid or <br/>\nresent.  And we don&#39;t want them to think staying home with the family is what <br/>\nhappens when you&#39;re bad. And because we&#39;ve been so supportive of and positive <br/>\nwith them there&#39;s rarely anything they do that anyone would consider &quot;bad&quot; <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&gt; Can you &quot;tell&quot; your child to do something and expect them to - i.e.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Feed the dog&quot;?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-=-Can you tell your husband to go do the week&#39;s shopping every week and <br/>\nexpect<br/>\nhim to do it?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have two grocery lists building at any moment, one for Costco (Keith&#39;s <br/>\nshopping) and one for regulary grocery store (mine).   When one hits critical <br/>\nmass or we&#39;re out of something, someone goes shopping.  I might ask him if he <br/>\ncould go soon, and he&#39;s glad to do that. Or if I need something quickly and it&#39;s <br/>\nnot a good day for him to go, I&#39;ll just go get it at the grocery store.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with the kids.  I ask them if it&#39;s a good time, or possible for them to <br/>\ndo something, if it&#39;s something I can&#39;t do and they can, or if I need help.    <br/>\nMarty and Kirby are both taller than I am so I ask them to put things up on <br/>\nhigh shelves and to change light bulbs.

So they feel big, and <br/>\ngood, and helpful, and adult when they do it, not small and helpless and <br/>\nput-upon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt ends up turning out that what we&#39;re talking about in all these cases isn&#39;t <br/>\nnearly so much &quot;who does what&quot; as &quot;who feels how&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-One of the reasons orders and punishment seem to work is that it makes<br/>\nsense.

It&#39;s because I&#39;ve not spent enough time with her. My mom saw this behaviour and I told her I thought it was because I wasn&#39;t spending time with her and she said something along the lines of, &#39;Bull, you&#39;re around her all the time!&#39; Well yeah but I&#39;m around her doing housework, chasing the toddler, checking email, whatever. When I sit down and give her my undivided attention and read to her for an hour or put together a puzzle or snuggle up for a movie the neediness goes away. Another thought, what about just including the child in the conversation? If the daughter&#39;s behaviour is rude what about the parents who may be trying to exclude her from the conversation they&#39;re having with someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Punishment...","postDate":"1091357320","msgId":97142,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMzI0MkM4LjI5NkJEJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwODAxMDI0MTEwLjM1NDM0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwNzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":97140,"nextInTopic":97143,"prevInTime":97141,"nextInTime":97143,"topicId":97139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So extending the philosophy into parenting gets discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s not something you want to do, then the discussion won&#39;t make any<br/>\nsense to you. It will seem like a lot of energy put into situations that can<br/>\neasily be solved with an order (and punishment if necessary).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What do you do with a child who is consistently contrary?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you don&#39;t relate in a way where there are things to be contrary about,<br/>\nthen there isn&#39;t a reason to be contrary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can you &quot;tell&quot; your child to do something and expect them to - i.e.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Feed the dog&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can you tell your husband to go do the week&#39;s shopping every week and expect<br/>\nhim to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is talking to your child ever not enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would talking to him about it ever not be enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve always believed in &quot;discipline&quot; which is defined simply as guiding or<br/>\n&gt; leading.  (I know many use the term &quot;discipline&quot; to mean spanking,<br/>\n&gt; etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Regardless of how one defines words, we all need to understand what we&#39;re<br/>\ntalking about in order to talk about it! We need to be using words in the<br/>\nsame way in order to understand what each is saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I say I guide my daughter, that may call up a different image to you --<br/>\nsince you followed &quot;guiding&quot; with leading as one might a dog on a leash --<br/>\nand you&#39;ll miss the point of what I&#39;m saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offere guidance but I&#39;m not trying to lead my daughter somewhere. I do<br/>\ntrust that she wants to live peacefully with others and, when she isn&#39;t, I<br/>\nunderstand that it&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t have the skills and understanding<br/>\nto figure out how to get what she wants without stepping on others.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your example was about chores. To understand how to put the unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy into practice in parenting, you need to see chores in a new way.<br/>\nAccept ownership of the home. It&#39;s all yours as are the messes your child<br/>\ncreates since her messes are part of the decision to have a child. (Just as<br/>\nlitter boxes are part of the decision to have an indoor cat!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesn&#39;t stop there! Ask for help. Ask as you would a friend and<br/>\naccept that the answer can be no since you are asking someone to set aside<br/>\nsomething that may be more important to them (even if it doesn&#39;t look<br/>\nimportant to you) to do something that may be uninteresting to them for you.<br/>\nAnd then appreciate the help they give, even if you think they could have<br/>\ndone more.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurn the situation around: If you had a friend who asked you to help -- but<br/>\nwasn&#39;t really &quot;asking&quot; since she wouldn&#39;t treat no kindly -- and then<br/>\ngrumped at you because you weren&#39;t helping the way she wanted and then said<br/>\n&quot;Thanks,&quot; when you were done but really meant &quot;It was the least you could<br/>\ndo,&quot; would you want to help that friend?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if your friend asked saying she understood you were busy but she was<br/>\nreally in a bind and could you help her out? And she appreciated whatever<br/>\nyou could do and thanked you sincerely at the end and offered lunch or to<br/>\ntake the kids for an afternoon (depending on how much she was asking) would<br/>\nyou want to help her again?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question really isn&#39;t can you say &quot;Feed the dog.&quot; The question is is<br/>\nthat treatment of another part of the type of relationship you want to build<br/>\nwith your child? I wouldnt&#39; want my husband to treat me that way, so I<br/>\ncertainly wouldn&#39;t want to treat another person -- and kids are persons too!<br/>\n-- that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yet... I have this lingering belief that &quot;punishment&quot; is not<br/>\n&gt; necessarily &quot;bad&quot;.  (punishment does not mean &quot;spanking&quot; only, but any type of<br/>\n&gt; correction like grounding, etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If your goal is to make your daughter conform to a certain behavior then<br/>\npunishment is one tool many people use.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is a more joyful family life and great relationships, then<br/>\nthere are better tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons orders and punishment seem to work is that it makes<br/>\nsense. The most direct path to getting what you want is to tell someone and<br/>\nhave them do it. Another reason is that it *looks* like it works. Compliant<br/>\nkids will do what they&#39;re told because fighting for what they want isn&#39;t<br/>\nworth it to them. That&#39;s conveninent for parents! But not a good character<br/>\nquality for a child when she&#39;s with people who are less trustworthy than her<br/>\nparents (a boyfriend? a pushy friend? an adult who seemed nice on the<br/>\nsurface?) and definitely not a useful character quality as an adult. Defiant<br/>\nkids may also comply. But then they&#39;ll do what they want when parents aren&#39;t<br/>\nlooking. (We can&#39;t really control what they do. But we can create the<br/>\nillusion that we can control them!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPunishment can raise great kids. It can also raise kids who want out of the<br/>\nhome as soon as possible and kids who are destructive and disrespectful. The<br/>\nsuccess of punishment based parenting depends on the child&#39;s personality and<br/>\nthe other ways the parent is relating to the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nParenting based on respect doesn&#39;t depend on the child&#39;s personality and it<br/>\nis the whole of how a parent relates to the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo really it isn&#39;t the punishment that works. It&#39;s other factors outside the<br/>\npunishment (the rest of the relationship and the personality.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is a sweetie and she&#39;s not punished. If decent kids can be<br/>\nraised without punishment, then why chance punishment?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It does not seem to matter quantity of time you spend with this child but as<br/>\n&gt; soon as you turn your attention away from this child, the child becomes<br/>\n&gt; immediately unruly, loud and gets right in your face.

Parents can be with a child<br/>\nwithout really *being* with a child if you know what I mean. They can spend<br/>\nthe time with a child in a way that they think is what the child needs, but<br/>\naren&#39;t really listening to what the child says (in various ways) that he<br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child says he needs attention, that&#39;s an honest message of what he&#39;s<br/>\nfeeling. The feelings aren&#39;t wrong and can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t be) changed. But<br/>\nhe can be helped to learn to set aside his needs for a bit so others can get<br/>\ntheir needs met. My daughter understood when I said it was my turn to talk.<br/>\nBut to understand allowing others their turn, she needs her turn to be given<br/>\njust as much respect. A needy 5 yo being asked to be away from mom for an<br/>\nhour isn&#39;t a reasonable expectation of his skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parenting focuses on behavior and ways to modify it. Peaceful<br/>\n(or mindful or respectful or relationship or unschooling or whatever one<br/>\nwants to call it) parenting focuses on building relationships, trusting that<br/>\nkids are doing the best they can with their skills and understanding of the<br/>\nworld. So problems aren&#39;t solved by finding ways to stop a behavior.<br/>\nProblems are solved by tending to what&#39;s causing the behavior. What&#39;s<br/>\nhappening isn&#39;t as important as why. Behavior is an expression of needs. The<br/>\nneeds don&#39;t go away because the behavior goes away. The needs often get<br/>\nexpressed in other ways or turned inward.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Punishment...","postDate":"1091338327","msgId":97140,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODAxMDUzMjA3LjYxNDc4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwODAxMDI0MTEwLjM1NDM0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwNzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":97139,"nextInTopic":97142,"prevInTime":97139,"nextInTime":97141,"topicId":97139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is one of the things I don t really understand.

(punishment does not mean &quot;spanking&quot; only, but any type of correction like grounding, etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that lingering belief is just the voice of your childhood in your head?  You&#39;ve seen that you don&#39;t need to punish your own daughter, so clearly you know it&#39;s not necessary to raise kind, happy child. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nand... if I can put in a late question... What do you do with a child who is insitent on being the center of attention?  To the point that the child gets in your face if you are conversing with someone else.  It does not seem to matter quantity of time you spend with this child but as soon as you turn your attention away from this child, the child becomes immediately unruly, loud and gets right in your face.  The parents are at their wits ends.  What suggestions can be given?  <br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nI would guess there&#39;s still some unmet need with that child.  Sure, the parents may be spending time in the same room with the child, but are they figuring out what his true needs for relationship are and how to meet them?  Is that time spent with the child, just time sharing space or time exploring the things that bring that child joy?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe child must be getting some reward for his behavior or he wouldn&#39;t continue doing it.  I&#39;d really try to find some way to give that child attention -- not just time -- that is his alone, in a consistent way always keeping the promise to be really with that child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn thinking about the idea that people are very happy to AP their infants and toddlers, but then drift away from it with older kids, it occurs to me that we recognize regression in a toddler or young child, as a sign that the child has an unmet need.  We then act accordingly, but we tend not to be as adept at seeing the same regression and clinginess in an older child -- we brand it rudeness or impatience, and don&#39;t honor their neediness.  I find I&#39;m guilty of it, too, with our 8yo -- he&#39;s always been very high needs, and sometimes I find myself thinking he should have outgrown this by now.  Then I remember it&#39;s a signal to me that he has an unmet need, not just a want but a real need he can&#39;t communicate to me in any other way.  That helps me to see he&#39;s really desperate and I can&#39;t ignore his desperation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so I&#39;ve rambled some -- I&#39;m on day two of serious neediness here -- but I&#39;d really try to see what the child&#39;s unmet need is.  Gotta go, Andy needs someone to help him settle down to sleep -- he (and I) were awake until 3 am last night. He was very keyed up a harrowing day yesterday and just still hasn&#39;t re-ordered himself.  I&#39;m beginning to fantasize about putting valium in his cocoa....<br/>\n<br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
