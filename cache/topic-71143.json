Call me crazy, but when <br/>\nsomeone is singing &quot;Looks like we made it....&quot;, supposedly written about her <br/>\nand her husband, makes millions on it, and a few months later has left him and <br/>\nis dating someone else...I just can&#39;t look at the song in the same way (not <br/>\nthat I ever liked it to begin with!)  When someone is singing about love, <br/>\nmarriage, leading a Christian life, and then leaves her husband of many years to <br/>\nmarry someone else who has left their wife of many years (Amy Grant and Vince <br/>\nGill), I just don&#39;t have the same respect for them or their &quot;work&quot;...it seems very <br/>\nhypocritical to me.  Remember Michael Landon?  He left his wife and family to <br/>\nstart a new one, and was constantly preaching &quot;family values.&quot;  *shrug*  this <br/>\nsort of thing just bothers me...I guess it&#39;s a fault of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And Michael Jackson, even if he has made some unfortunate cosmetic choices <br/>\n&gt; and even if he is an arrested development nutcase, has still written some <br/>\n&gt; really <br/>\n&gt; good music and survived a crazed abused life.   And he can dance.  And there <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is video of when he was dancing and NOT so sadly messed up.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the saddest thing about Michael Jackson is that he obviously had some <br/>\nreal deep problems...self esteem, abuse when he was younger, never being able <br/>\nto BE a child.  None of these things were addressed and when he tried to fix <br/>\nthings in his own way (cosmetic surgery, fantasy living (?)) it was all done <br/>\nin the public eye.  He was/is a very talented person who just has a lot of <br/>\nproblems. :o(  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s being done now with the King James Bible, which for hundreds of <br/>\n&gt; years <br/>\n&gt; was worshipped by many Christians as the perfect, inspired word of God.   <br/>\n&gt; Ah, <br/>\n&gt; but lately scholars are saying James was not quite a heterosexual model of <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; American family man.   Yeah?  Duh.  *HE* didn&#39;t translate the Bible any more <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; than Elizabeth herself built those ships and sailed against the Spanish <br/>\n&gt; Armada <br/>\n&gt; or Victoria personally made everyone sexually uptight.  Royalty gets their <br/>\n&gt; label on stuff in England.  Ancient tradition.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now Americans in DROVES are rejecting the King James Version (KJV as it <br/>\n&gt; was once lovingly referred to) for being the evil project of a sodomite.  I <br/>\n&gt; suspect the language finally became too archaic for them and they need a <br/>\n&gt; reason to <br/>\n&gt; dump it.  So homosexuality is scapegoated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if homosexuality is the whole thing...being of a Catholic <br/>\nbackground, we have problems with it in other areas...things being left out, others <br/>\nbeing added.  I think Christians are just being dealt now what Catholics have <br/>\nbeen saddled with their whole lives...being labled &quot;unrighteous&quot; because of <br/>\nthings like the crusades, indulgences, etc...things their &quot;leaders&quot; or those in <br/>\ncharge did in the name of their religion.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m really hoping my kids will judge art on its own merits, not on whether <br/>\n&gt; the artist had a cute butt, or whether the songwriter was a pinko commie.

Would she deserve respect from Hispanic people <br/>\nbecause she has a lovely voice?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I love the book, &#39;The Education of Little Tree&quot;....but it DOES sadden me to <br/>\nknow that the author also wrote white supremecist speeches...I just can&#39;t <br/>\nlook at it the same way.  If it turned out that a favorite actor of mine <br/>\nsupported a cause I absolutely disagreed with, should I give him more money to support <br/>\nthat cause by buying his DVD&#39;s because he&#39;s a great actor?  He&#39;s a <br/>\nhypocritical pig...who CARES what a great actor he is...there are PLENTY of other great <br/>\nactors out there, unknowns who have never gotten a break.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; That said, Kevin Costner seems to be paid huge amounts of money for doing a <br/>\n&gt; lame job.

Maybe <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; a good businessman who can keep his own franchise afloat financially.  And <br/>\n&gt; maybe he&#39;s there because lots of women find him attractive.

He is still with his wife who is the first woman he ever dated.  <br/>\nHe raised his kids nicely and did all kinds of physical family vacations with <br/>\nthem.  He was good to his mother, and his step father, and his sister.  He <br/>\nresearched his historical parts and characters and locations himself, instead of <br/>\njust showing up and taking someone else&#39;s word for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that said, I have friends who have expressed what you have about certain <br/>\nactors, and it baffles me (and makes me think they&#39;re not too analytical, or <br/>\nthat they have a teen-fan mentality).   Maybe it&#39;s because they don&#39;t really <br/>\ncare about acting or music or whatever it is.  Maybe they are using <br/>\nidentification with famous people for something I totally do not understand, but for <br/>\nexample my friend Wendy used to love Harrison Ford above all actors, and owned all <br/>\nHarrison Ford movies.  He left his wife, and she hates Harrison Ford now, and <br/>\nwill not watch his movies, and doesn&#39;t want God to let him be on any more <br/>\nmagazine covers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Michael Jackson, even if he has made some unfortunate cosmetic choices <br/>\nand even if he is an arrested development nutcase, has still written some really <br/>\ngood music and survived a crazed abused life.

So her music sucks (in my sister&#39;s world).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me the ultimate prejudice to judge someone for a socio-political <br/>\nsin and to go backwards and brand all his work prior to that as tainted or <br/>\nunworthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s being done now with the King James Bible, which for hundreds of years <br/>\nwas worshipped by many Christians as the perfect, inspired word of God.
