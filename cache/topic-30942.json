I have talked with counsellers from her school <br/>\nand they are not offering me anything except one program which is only <br/>\ntemporary( then she would go back to the big environment, yet it is full and <br/>\nso u cant get in anyway. They do offer that she could go to court...but <br/>\nnothing would be done( they told me this) as a result of her missing <br/>\nschool...only thing possibly is a charge...which parents would have to pay. <br/>\nBut... they have done nothing anyway. So.. she is sent by me out to school <br/>\nbut doesnt stay. thats the predicament and she is not yet sixteen till next <br/>\nnovember. thanks everyone.  :)  Faith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Sarah Carothers&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro and question<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 10 Jan 2002 11:49:49 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello Faith,<br/>\n&gt;glad you found the list... we need more teen parents here :-).<br/>\n&gt;I have a 15 yr old daughter and there are several others here with teens <br/>\n&gt;(boys and girls).<br/>\n&gt;  I&#39;m not sure of your question, so I&#39;ll restate what you said how I <br/>\n&gt;interpreted it.<br/>\n&gt;You dd is not happy at school & isn&#39;t thriving in that environment.<br/>\n&gt;You have taken her out but don&#39;t know what to do next.<br/>\n&gt;Do you know what your local laws are that you would fall under? (do you <br/>\n&gt;have to sign up with a charter school? do you have to test her annually?.. <br/>\n&gt;.that sort of thing).<br/>\n&gt;There are plenty of places to gather that type of information and I&#39;m sure <br/>\n&gt;some can provide links for you. If you are thinking along the lines of <br/>\n&gt;changing your whole outlook on learning and the goals your teen has, this <br/>\n&gt;would be the place to hang out and ask questions.<br/>\n&gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt;Sarah<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Faith Mills<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2002 11:41 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro and question<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Hello....someone told me about this list. I&#39;m from Ontario, Canada. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt;   sure if some of you have teenagers also out of school or if this list is <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;   younger kids out of school, but I have a fifteen yr. old daughter whom <br/>\n&gt;does<br/>\n&gt;   not do well in the highschool system and has been leaving because<br/>\n&gt;   emotionally she seems to not be coping, lots of circumstances of <br/>\n&gt;violence<br/>\n&gt;   from students and the toleration of it.. ..she is afraid to go, yet she <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;   not sixteen yet . Can anyone offer any substitute programs as the school <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;   not offering me much help. Kind of at my wits end. thankyou all  Faith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30940,"nextTopicId":30908}}
