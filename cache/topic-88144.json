She seemed into it. Each day I asked her when she wanted to it that day, where, etc., trying to let her lead it as much as possible. Not surprisingly, it rapidly turned into battle ground. After 3 weeks (only about a week of battling), I threw up my hands and said, &quot;Em, you really don&#39;t seem to be into this. It&#39;s not fun for me, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not fun for you. I want you to enjoy reading, not dread it. What do you want to do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe completely left off with, thankfully, minimal damage done. She didn&#39;t read for about 3 weeks--about the same amount of time as the &quot;deal&quot; lasted. Then, one night she brought a bunch of books into our room and proceeded to read four of them to me. I didn&#39;t interrupt, teach, anything. Now, she says things like, &quot;I only read when I want to!&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m getting really good at reading, aren&#39;t I?&quot; Whew! Thank goodness this crisis wasn&#39;t bigger and I found this board when I did! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night I touched base with dh again about the unschooling, how he thought it was going, was he happy with the reading, etc. He&#39;s been really impressed watching the kids lately, and I think he&#39;s been paying more careful attention. So, dripping sarcasm, he says to me, &quot;Ehhh, I think I need to sit on her some more about it. Set her back about another 6 months.&quot; Yes! He&#39;s finally getting it! That was a pretty great moment--almost as great as when Emily looked at me and said what a good reader she was! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Trouble with Dad","postDate":"1073853534","msgId":88449,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhLjEwYzg3OTMuMmQzMzBlNWVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":88445,"nextInTopic":88453,"prevInTime":88448,"nextInTime":88450,"topicId":88144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/11/04 12:50:03 PM, mulwiler@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1752118663\">In a message dated 1/11/04 12:50:03 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mulwiler@...\">mulwiler@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Maybe focus on one issue at a time?

As I have said, we are new to unschooling, so the changes are tough for him.  We have always been scheduled people, and it worked for us.  Or at least we thought it did.  I love this new lifestyle and want him to embrace it as I have.  He travels for work, so is away from home.  His travels comes and goes, so he will go for a while with no travel, then have 4-5 trips in as many weeks, being gone for 2-3 days each time.  He is trying go with the flow, but is refusing to budge on the food issue.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe sees no problem with telling our 6 year old son that he has to eat his vegetables.  We really do not have a problem with him eating them, he likes them. Go figure.  I have changed to letting him decide what he wants to eat and when he wants to do it.  Hubby feels that meals should be eaten at meal time, and that gummies after cereal and yogurt, is not appropriate.  I feel that he ate a great breakfast, and if he still wants gummies, then let him have them.  The entire meal was my sons choice, and it was eaten at 10:30, not at 8:00, like my husband feels it should be.  He was also upset at his choice of lunch, peanuts dipped in apple sauce.  My argument to him, fruit and protein, what is wrong with that.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would like to get my husband on my side, and have him see that this is a good thing, showing our son that we have faith in his decisions.  Any suggestions on how I can approach this issue again with him.<br/>\n <br/>\nI did mention to him that I was going to start making him eat vegetables. His response was that he is an adult.  My argument is why does that matter.  He does not see it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorry about this being so long.
