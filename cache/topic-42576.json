I finally got around to <br/>\n  reading John Taylor Gatto&#39;s book &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot;. I wish I&#39;d done <br/>\n  it sooner when we were agonizing about what to do for our kids. He <br/>\n  lays out what we figured out after being subjected to the system for <br/>\n  a few years. Anyway, I know many people audit these groups to learn <br/>\n  more about homeschooling and unschooling in an attempt to figure out <br/>\n  if it is for them. Read this book if there is any doubt in your mind <br/>\n  that institutionalized schooling in America damages children, <br/>\n  families and ultimately our society. You can also check out Mr. <br/>\n  Gatto&#39;s web site at www.johntaylorgatto.com . I also strongly <br/>\n  recommend &quot;Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes Sense&quot; by David <br/>\n  Guterson as well as David and Micki Colfax&#39;s &quot;Homeschooling for <br/>\n  Excellence&quot;. Good Luck. Caroline<br/>\n  PS Perhaps Gatto&#39;s book would be a good one for someone&#39;s mother in <br/>\n  law!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
