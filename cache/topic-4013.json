We are planning to continue<br/>\nutilizing Design-A-Study Guides, the Prairie Primer, our public libraries,<br/>\nand internet/computer educational materials.  We will further enhance our<br/>\ncurriculum with several of the following activities:  COSI, The Columbus<br/>\nZoo, The Wilds, Ohio Historical Society Events and Activities, Dawes<br/>\nArboretum, Girl Scouts, 4-H, piano lessons, Thistledown Youong Actor&#39;s<br/>\nTheater, swimming, and skating.  Some of our schedule field trips include:<br/>\nXXXXXXX (long list) and others.  We will be taking advantage of Fire<br/>\nPrevention Week activities, reading clubs and various other such emphasis<br/>\nweeks and activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis works here and allows us the freedom to change a lot!  It is just a<br/>\nlist to show we have thought through what we want to do we are not legally<br/>\nrequired to stick with all we write.  Even though I list Design-A-Study I<br/>\nprobably only use it a handful of times during the year.  You could<br/>\ncompletely leave out any names of curricula and show a list of the<br/>\neducational materials you plan to use other than that of an established<br/>\ncurricula.  I usually do this as a separate attachment page as their form<br/>\nonly allows me a small space to respond to what our curriculum will be.
