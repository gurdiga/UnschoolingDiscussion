What I do <br/>\nthink is that we, as human beings, react negatively to things happening to <br/>\nother folks that we would not want to happen to ourselves (ie, be abandoned <br/>\nin a most-public manner by our spouses, have a daughter kidnapped, etc) so <br/>\nin a feeling of solidarity with the injured party, we admonish the doer of <br/>\nthe negative actions and the negative action itself in story-form.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of us yearns somewhat for the story-teller mode of information <br/>\nin transmitting social mores, responsibilities and &#39;warnings&#39; to each <br/>\nother.  Actors and other media darlings are well-known, and so the stories <br/>\nthat surround them are more easily accessible (and retained?) than would be <br/>\na story about my cousin Steve, who nobody&#39;s met or is interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn another way, what some media darlings do in their personal lives where <br/>\nit transects professional lives, *does* affect &#39;my business&#39;.  (ie, putting <br/>\npersonal &#39;buddies&#39; into positions of authority where they can do great <br/>\nharm.)  When that happens, you can be sure that I make it my business and <br/>\nactually try to have influence over what is going on (or make some noise <br/>\nabout it at least!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;They are harassed daily by the media and the things done to them<br/>\n&gt;would be ILLEGAL if they were done to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like what?<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of any legal harassment that could happen to them that would <br/>\nnot also be legal if it happened to little-old-me.<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Self-reliance is the antidote to institutional stupidity.&quot; JTGatto, <br/>\nMonarch Notes guide to One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Judgemental: celebrities and standards","postDate":"1054510768","msgId":71761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0OS4xMjZkMzViNC4yYzBiZThiMEBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71789,"prevInTime":71760,"nextInTime":71762,"topicId":71761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the lime light of Hollywood, just as it isn t our business whether the President is doing an intern or not.
