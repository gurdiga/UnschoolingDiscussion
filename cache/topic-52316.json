The other day we were watching<br/>\na dvd , that we own by the way and can watch anytime, and he was geting<br/>\nrestless, not paying attention, so I stopped it, and he FREAKED out , and<br/>\nstarted screaming like he was being stabbed or something, and yelling at<br/>\nme to turn it on , &quot; quick, hurry,&quot; like it was a t.v. program he was<br/>\ngoing to miss. ( In reality it was LOTR which he&#39;s seen at least 20 times<br/>\nnow!) We went through probably 30 minutes of screaming and crying and<br/>\nteling me he hated me and pounding on the wall, before he finally calmed<br/>\ndown, and then - HE DIDN&quot;T WANT To watch the movie!<br/>\nThis happens alot, although not always as bad, when things don&#39;t go just<br/>\nhis way. It&#39;s a problem we deal with all the time. One thing that often<br/>\nworks for us, is that I will mirror his action s back to him, if he bangs<br/>\nthe wall , I bang the wall, and usually in a over the top exaggerated<br/>\nway, or I make a really obnoxious sound or face, and we wind up laughing,<br/>\nwhich breaks the tension.<br/>\n<br/>\nReminding him/ helping him to breathe often helps as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he yells ,I hate you!, I&#39;ll say, yeah, I know, like it&#39;s no big, or<br/>\nelse,(in a real sweet tone:) yes, of course , I hate you too! To this he<br/>\nusually responds &quot; No you don&#39;t! &quot; so I&#39;ll say No YOU don&#39;t and often<br/>\nleads to a discussion about emotions, and how anger can feel like hatred,<br/>\nor how you can love someone very much, but yet not like them at the<br/>\nmoment, etc. etc. - we&#39;ve had some pretty good conversations here.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften, I just sit back and let him get it out of his system, then he&#39;s<br/>\nfine.<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the days when my patience is short and I snap back at him<br/>\nand it turns into a day long power struggle! Not proud of THOSE days, but<br/>\nthey happen , much more than I&#39;d like to admit :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t really offer any advce about out in public though, as I lucked<br/>\nout there. He&#39;s usualy a perfect angel in front of other people!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrisha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52312,"nextTopicId":52112}}
