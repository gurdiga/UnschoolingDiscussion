Yelling.  I finally said &quot;WHY are <br/>\nyou yelling at me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said &quot;Because you were yelling at me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he started it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I&#39;m going to treat him like a person I shouldn&#39;t yell at him and I <br/>\ncan&#39;t get made because he yelled at his mom.  He was yelling at another <br/>\nperson.  I&#39;m the one who made the groundrules, so I couldn&#39;t say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>\nyell at your mother.&quot;  The little voices inside me said &quot;Don&#39;t let him yell <br/>\nat you like that,&quot; but the bigger wiser voice told me to stop yelling at him <br/>\nand the whole thing would be over.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe hugged and touched and checked on each other sweetly more the next day <br/>\nthan we had for two weeks before that.  And maybe that was part of the <br/>\nproblem too.  We hadn&#39;t connected as much as usual for several days before <br/>\nthe incident.  He had lost his normal contact with what I needed and was <br/>\ndoing and why, and I wasn&#39;t aware of the frustrations of his day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had failed to be together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59660,"nextTopicId":59657}}
