I don&#39;t push him on it (unless you count asking him to pay for something or figure how many blocks he needs to build a wall, etc.) but I usually end up asking him to come play a game or cards or figure his &quot;piggy bank&quot; contents, etc., to try to make using numbers a bigger part of his day.  It never fails to surprise me (happily, of course) when he pops off an answer to something I had no idea he even knew about, let alone how to do!<br/>\n <br/>\nFor example, we were &quot;practicing&quot; his basic addition (at his request!) - I asked 3+3=?  He wasn&#39;t even looking at me, so I thought he was getting bored and about to stop...  Hello?  He looks up at me and says, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s easy!  It&#39;s the same as 3x2=?  It&#39;s 6!&quot;  I thought my jaw was going to fall off since we hadn&#39;t really even touched on multiplication - just a short 30-second explanation several weeks earlier when he decided he didn&#39;t want to work on that yet!  Ds is 7 (almost 8) so I didn&#39;t really worry too much since he has plenty of time yet, but wow!!!  I was so excited that I called everyone I knew to brag!!!  (I know, most kids learn how to do math, but I was really proud of him for figuring the concept out on his own and to see his excitement reflected in my own was a real prize for him.)<br/>\n <br/>\nThen this weekend I showed him the sudoku game online (at the grandparents&#39; house.)  I hesitated to show him, since I thought it might be a little hard for him, but I sat with him and we finished the game several times.  The next night...  he came running asking to play it again!!!
