I find his way of talking to kids respectful and <br/>\nkind--it&#39;s very clear he really loves kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never tell a kid who loved Teletubbies it was stupid. And I actually <br/>\nkind of enjoy Pokemon...but mostly because of Jessie and James. Now, THEY are <br/>\ncool. But Ash is SUCH a whiner. And I&#39;m afraid Brock has a constipation <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took Julian to the first Pokemon movie when it came out. The short before <br/>\nthe main movie mostly involved Pokemon repeating their names over and over, <br/>\nwith occasional musical interludes with colors behind Pokemon. (A friend <br/>\ndescribed it as Pikachu on acid.) I kept thinking, &quot;If this whole thing is <br/>\nlike this my brain is going to explode!&quot; Luckily, it wasn&#39;t, and it didn&#39;t. I <br/>\nkind of liked the second one. We never got around to the third.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn, babbling once again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24984,"nextTopicId":24844}}
