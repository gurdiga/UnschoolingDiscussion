He also still naps, which is good down time<br/>\n for me, unless the older are wanting to do something special with me then.<br/>\n I just grab the time I can--first thing in the a.m., many days; in the<br/>\n afternoon during the littlest&#39;s nap time; whenever they&#39;re off playing<br/>\n together. I don&#39;t spend the whole day intensely involved with my kids. They<br/>\n spend a lot of every day at play--sometimes together, sometimes separately.<br/>\n So I&#39;ve not found getting my time alone to be all that hard.

So at 5 I was sent to first grade, it<br/>\ngets worse from there. But the year before I&#39;d already read the entire<br/>\nLittle woman novel on my own so the Dick and Jane books bored me to tears.<br/>\nThey brought me 8th grade readers (the highest grade in the school) but<br/>\nthose were too easy and still boring. From then on the teachers pretty much<br/>\nignored me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Good for you for taking him out and giving him the time he needed to know <br/>\n&gt;that he is an intelligent and capable human being.

I think the first thing my non reader read cover to cover was a<br/>\nbook on the titanic because it gave him all the information he needed to<br/>\nwork through a simulation game on the Titanic<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I heard something recently that says that performing movement at the same <br/>\n&gt;time one is learning something new actually helps the learner retain the <br/>\n&gt;information better<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve heard similar things. The theory I heard is that for some children<br/>\nthey just can&#39;t sit still for long as they get bored and the mind will<br/>\nwander, but if their hands are busy they can concentrate better.  All I<br/>\nknow is that my youngest still gets more out of being read to, and boy does<br/>\nhe, and he is usually doing something else at the same time.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;It&#39;s different at each stage.

My son also liked PE the<br/>\n most in school. So we made sure to have lots of physical things spread out<br/>\n through the week.  With art getting so little a section, maybe he just<br/>\n needs to see real art.  My children hated art at school.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason Wes hates art is because he was forced to paint flowers in <br/>\nwatercolors.  Last fall he told me he wanted to take a class in cartooning so <br/>\nI&#39;m going to find him one this fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Each year they<br/>\n made ceramics. they hated ceramics by the time they left. I have so many<br/>\n bowls I don&#39;t know what to do with them. That&#39;s all they made, bowls.  But<br/>\n they saw me crocheting and asked me to show them how, they both did well<br/>\n and enjoyed it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that art is something that should be explored not forced.  I <br/>\ntoo would dislike anything that someone told me I had to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &gt;I called another elementary school that 2 moms had recommended to see if <br/>\nwe <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;could come visit.

I don&#39;t like anyplace<br/>\n that wants me to wait until things settle down more.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually called two other schools the next week.  One of them, our <br/>\nneighborhood school, said that they didn&#39;t allow children to observe because <br/>\nit was too disruptive to the class.  And the next school closest to us warned <br/>\nme that the were expecting their fourth grade classes to have about 36 kids <br/>\nin each class and that they couldn&#39;t get funding to hire anything more than a <br/>\nteacher&#39;s aid.  Jeff and I decided that we didn&#39;t need to waste our time <br/>\nvisiting.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt; For me I didn&#39;t know I could hs my children. Then I listened to<br/>\n family/friends who reminded me that while I had my degree, I wasn&#39;t all<br/>\n that good at math and wouldn&#39;t be able to teach them. I wish I would have<br/>\n done it sooner, but then I think about the way this happened for us and<br/>\n realized that while I can&#39;t change the past at least I listened to my<br/>\n children and let them make the decision. Now at least I won&#39;t have to worry<br/>\n about them coming back asking why I never let them go to school.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs parents we do the best we can at any given moment.  The important thing is <br/>\nthat you listened to your kids and acted on it.  This is what good parenting <br/>\nis all about.

During that time my oldest could ride his bike<br/>\n around where I could see or could have my attention. We read a lot while<br/>\n the younger one, supposedly playing basketball, actually listened.  I<br/>\n realized how much he was listening when last year I asked him if he wanted<br/>\n me to read him Tom Sawyer as it was one of his brothers favorites. He told<br/>\n me he remembered me reading it while he played basketball.  I didn&#39;t really<br/>\n believe he remembered the story, but just to prove the point he told me the<br/>\n story mostly in order letting me know all his favorite parts. BTW his<br/>\n favorite part was how Tom convinced the others to whitewash the fence. He<br/>\n did ask what whitewash was, but he knew the story.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow this is great!  I have started reading the Lion the Witch and the <br/>\nWardrobe series to my kids.
