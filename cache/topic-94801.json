Mine are 4 and 7, and have relatively independent personalities anyways. They often go off and play with each other or on their own. Also, we&#39;re involved in a very active homeschooling group, so we&#39;ve got lots of group stuff and playtime. Often when we&#39;re together with other kids, the other mom(s) and I trade off going and doing things (like errands or exercise or whatever) while the kids play. Also, my DH is a big player in our unschooling day. He&#39;ll come home and wrestle with the kids, watch a TV show, build things, or make cookies with them. Sometimes we do things as a whole family, and sometimes I take the time to go and do things on my own. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My day today was a typical day. I had little breaks here and there<br/>\n&gt;but needed the breaks to rest, not to go pursue another activity.<br/>\n&gt;Collapse into a chair for some computer time here and there, a shower<br/>\n&gt;while the boys watched a video, and a short nap when dh got home.<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s how it usually goes. When I get breaks, I need to rest and<br/>\n&gt;recuperate, not dig into a new project of my own, no matter how<br/>\n&gt;appealing that project is to me!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think different people recharge in different ways, and it sounds like you&#39;ve found what works best for you. For me, I recharge by being active or creative, so I use my breaks to write, exercise, garden, or do other active things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Tomorrow I have to make a dessert to take to a memorial day picnic<br/>\n&gt;and pack up the minivan with extra clothes and stuff we need for the<br/>\n&gt;park. And I promised Matt we could sew his chair and I have a little<br/>\n&gt;bit of grass to mow and I promised Alisha I&#39;d help her organize her<br/>\n&gt;room, and work on her mighty beanz house some more because sometimes<br/>\n&gt;the mighty beanz are getting stuck when they go down the tubes.<br/>\n&gt;Alisha is low on shorts and I don&#39;t have any bras clean so I need to<br/>\n&gt;do some laundry. I seem to remember that Luke wanted to do something<br/>\n&gt;tomorrow (probably something to do with Christmas! lol) but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;remember what.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And I&#39;m supposed to pursue my own interests when? lol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, like I said, I think it&#39;s a matter of priorities. It sounds like your interests and your activities right now are in alignment - you&#39;re doing what you want to be doing. If you had other interests that were really calling to you, you&#39;d probably find time to pursue them on way or another. With stuff I really want to do, I&#39;ve found that I have to be creative to find the time. I can get up before the kids get up, or go to sleep a couple hours after them. I can do my stuff when DH gets home, I can ask a friend to have a trade-off playdate where we each take turns watching the kids and do things then. I can ask DH for a specific time commitment (when I wrote my 1st novel, DH committed to 2 hours a day, every day, so that I could leave the house and write - I found it impossible to keep the plot in my head and write when I was home with the kids). For exercise, I can take the kids to the gym, I can ride bikes with them, I can put my bike on my trainer in the basement and put in a movie and pedal while we watch . I&#39;ve started doing some runs where my son will ride his bike while I run. As soon as my daughter is off of training wheels, I&#39;ll probably be able to run while both of them bike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s not a huge priority. But I started some seeds indoors that will<br/>\n&gt;have to be thrown away because I never had time to plant them<br/>\n&gt;outside. It had me stressed out for awhile, but then I just accepted<br/>\n&gt;that it was okay to plant seeds and not finish the project. It has<br/>\n&gt;to be. I did get a few of them planted outside (despite protests<br/>\n&gt;from the kids!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree - sometimes we can&#39;t just do everything we plan to, and it&#39;s okay to let some expectations fall. I think it&#39;s only a problem if it&#39;s something you really want to get accomplished, and I don&#39;t think that all of a parent&#39;s projects should necessarily have to be given up. There&#39;s creative ways to find the time to get to them, but sometimes it does take a fair bit of effort to do so and so you have to figure in whether the trade-off is personally worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;But if gardening was really important to you, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;&gt; see anything wrong with saying &quot;I&#39;ll make mighty beanz houses for<br/>\n&gt;&gt; awhile, then I&#39;m going to go garden for awhile. You&#39;re welcome to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; bring your mighty beanz and play outside and talk with me while I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; garden.&quot; &quot;(okay, so I have do admit, I have no clue about what<br/>\n </span></blockquote>these<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; mighty beanz things are...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And if they&#39;re not happy with that? My kids wouldn&#39;t be. They&#39;d cry<br/>\n&gt;and tell me they hate when I don&#39;t play with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how old your kids are, but I guess I&#39;d assume that a kid who is old enough to bike to the store with a friend is probably old enough to understand that sometimes mom is going to do something she wants and that child can find something to fill their time for a little while. Also, I&#39;d think about finding other playmates for my kids other than just mom. It&#39;s hard to be 100% of the entertainment, 100% of the time and have no time left to even put a few plants in the ground without the kids carrying on about it. In my life, it&#39;s a balancing act. I try to make sure that my kids have enough time with me to do things that they want to do, and I also do things I&#39;m interested in. When I&#39;m gardening, they&#39;re always welcome to come outside and join me, or just bring their toys outside and play on the lawn next to the garden. <br/>\n<br/>\nOften, my kids are playing something imaginative, and I just join in while I&#39;m doing whatever I need to get done. For instance, this morning while I was cooking breakfast, I was being interrogated by Ogel, who is a tiny Lego bad guy that my son plays with. The reason that Ogel was interrogating me (this gets complicated) is that my daughter has a small Seadra (Pokemon) toy who has fallen in love with a Skeletor (one of Ogel&#39;s Lego minions). Skeletor and Seadra are planning to elope and get married. This has angered Ogel, who doesn&#39;t want his skeletor marrying into the forces of good (a bit of a Romeo and Juliet story going on here). Ogel is gathering his forces to crash their wedding and kidnap Skeletor. Meanwhile, the Ojos (my son&#39;s invented force of Lego guys) are marshaling their own team to post sentries around the secret wedding site. They have a plan to drop a bridesmaid&#39;s dress onto Ogel and make him a part of the wedding. It&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess how this soap opera will turn out, but it has been going on all morning. Asa (my daughter) just ran in here with Seadra and I had to hide Seadra and her lover Skeletor in my sunglass case. Today, we&#39;re going to use the digital camera to turn it all into a picture story, make sets and costumes and such. We&#39;ve done this with several of the kids&#39; Lego stories. I like to help them out with the stuff they need assistance with, but I also like them to create as much of the stuff as they can - that way their story is really theirs, and the sets and costumes and stuff are their own creations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I did it in<br/>\n&gt;spite of their complaints, they&#39;d probably start fighting and someone<br/>\n&gt;would end up crying because they got punched or scratched or kicked<br/>\n&gt;and I&#39;d have to stop gardening anyway to take care of the hurt child<br/>\n&gt;or break up a fight. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you&#39;re saying that your kids can&#39;t ever play together without you playing too? Maybe you can help them find ways to get along with each other. I know when kids are really young, they don&#39;t really have the skills yet to get along. It&#39;s only been in the last year, since my daughter turned 4 that the kids could play for long periods of time. But before that, I&#39;d play with them awhile, then go do some stuff, and when they got in a place where they couldn&#39;t solve problems themselves, I&#39;d come hang out for awhile again. Of course, we also do tons of stuff together, but I think being able to play with each other and play with other kids is a great thing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Or they&#39;d drop a mighty beanz in the grass and<br/>\n&gt;be all upset and need me to search the grass for their mighty bean.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find that putting a big blanket out on the grass lets the kids play with small stuff like Legos without getting them lost in the grass. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I worried about that for awhile. (me and my over-analyzing again!<br/>\n&gt;lol). I would hear people say that they pursue their own interests<br/>\n&gt;and get all kinds of work done while their kids are off playing by<br/>\n&gt;themselves, only asking for adult input once in awhile. Was there<br/>\n&gt;something wrong that my kids want to spend the majority of their time<br/>\n&gt;with me? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To me, it wouldn&#39;t be that they wanted to be with me, but that they were *incapable* of playing without me that would ring some warning bells. If the kids don&#39;t know how to get along without punching and scratching and kicking if I&#39;m not there, to me that would be a problem and I&#39;d need to find ways to help them figure out how to get along with people other than myself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Why does trying to never say no to a request seem to mean<br/>\n&gt;that I spend most of my day doing stuff with or for the kids when for<br/>\n&gt;other people it seems all the kids want is a sandwich here and there,<br/>\n&gt;maybe a board game for half an hour and occasional conversation? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on your goals. I don&#39;t have the goal of never saying no to a request. I try to accomodate requests as best as I can. *Usually* that doesn&#39;t mean saying no. It might mean &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll help you build a fortress as soon as I finish unloading the dishwasher - why don&#39;t you guys go get the pillows out of the closet.&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure my kids can get started building a fortress for a couple of minutes without me if I&#39;m in the middle of something else. Likewise, I wouldn&#39;t think to ask them to immediately stop a game if I wanted them to do something. In either case, we can wait for the other person to finish what they&#39;re doing and find a stopping point, we try to be respectful of each other&#39;s needs. We&#39;re all people in this household, and we all try to help each other do what we need or want to get accomplished. That includes their needs/wants and mine and DH&#39;s (and the cat&#39;s and dog&#39;s and the guinea pig&#39;s needs and wants too, for that matter).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;getting to the point where I&#39;ve just accepted that we&#39;re all<br/>\n&gt;different, our kids are all different, and the fact that mine need me<br/>\n&gt;a lot just has to be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s okay for you, and if it&#39;s working in your hoursehold and you&#39;re okay with the way it&#39;s working then I guess it is. If you feel that the things you do with your kids are all the fulfillment you need, then it is definitely working okay for you. But if you feel like there are things that you want to do but can&#39;t because your kids cannot play without you there, then I would guess that it&#39;s not working, and you could maybe find some creative ways for it to work for everyone a bit better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We had done that the day before. I left the younger 2 home with<br/>\n&gt;their dad and went bike riding on a trail with a picnic lunch (we<br/>\n&gt;drove to the trail) with Alisha and her friend and her friend&#39;s mom.<br/>\n&gt;I can&#39;t do that when I have the younger two with me though, because<br/>\n&gt;they ride slow and can&#39;t keep up with the older ones. Matt still<br/>\n&gt;needs me to walk beside him and hold onto the handle bars as he<br/>\n&gt;pedals to keep him from falling off.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have a tag-a-long, which is the cool bike contraption that is like a kid&#39;s tandem that attaches to the back of my bike. My youngest can ride on that while my oldest rides his own bike. It really makes family bike rides a blast. If you&#39;ve never seen one, you might be interested in checking it out:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whycycle.co.uk/children-tagalong.htm\">http://www.whycycle.co.uk/children-tagalong.htm</a>  . This year, we&#39;re going to get a regular tandem and hook the tag-a-long to that, so I can ride with both kids if we want to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She&#39;s not an outgoing person at all. What I did when she wanted to<br/>\n&gt;try working there was to go with her and when people came up to me to<br/>\n&gt;pay for stuff, I redirected them to her. So in order for her to<br/>\n&gt;spend a day at work earning money, I had to go to work with her.<br/>\n&gt;That worked out okay on days when dh was off of work to stay with the<br/>\n&gt;younger two, but I couldn&#39;t do that on days when I had the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, that would be hard. I wonder if there would be a way for her to look more official so that it was obvious without your presence. Some kind of outfit or name tag or something? A sign?

Right now my passion is unschooling my<br/>\n&gt; kids, and if I&#39;m going to do a good job of it, there isn&#39;t time for<br/>\n&gt; much else.  I expect to have time for different, changing interests<br/>\n&gt; as they get older.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My day today was a typical day.

Matt&#39;s took the most time because his was 2<br/>\n&gt; stories with an elevator and a fire escape.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday at the flea market my 4 year old asked his grandpa for a 3<br/>\n&gt; ft. Christmas tree and decorations, and he got it.  He is absolutely<br/>\n&gt; fascinated with Christmas, even in May. ;)  So we went up and got out<br/>\n&gt; Christmas videos and books and a few decorations from storage.  I<br/>\n&gt; helped him untangle Christmas lights and made him a cardboard tunnel<br/>\n&gt; for his train track. (His train track was Thomas the tank engine<br/>\n&gt; track going around the tree.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2 kids wanted a different kind of koolaid, so I made 2 pitchers of<br/>\n&gt; koolaid.  I ran the dishwasher 2 times and did a load of laundry.<br/>\n&gt; Luke broke a Christmas bulb in the livingroom so I had to clean up<br/>\n&gt; that area and then vaccum where he broke it.  I heated leftovers up<br/>\n&gt; for supper.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt wanted furniture for his mighty beanz house--a bed and a chair.<br/>\n&gt; So we went into storage to go through garbage bags of old sheets and<br/>\n&gt; clothes we saved for cutting up and sewing, and he picked out sheets<br/>\n&gt; to use.  I had to clean the kitchen table off to get the sewing<br/>\n&gt; machine out, which had gotten pretty cluttered from different<br/>\n&gt; activities in the last few weeks.  I probably spent 1/2 an hour on<br/>\n&gt; that.  Then I sewed a bed for the mighty beanz and a matching sheet<br/>\n&gt; for them to cover up with.  We didn&#39;t do the chair yet so that will<br/>\n&gt; have to wait for tomorrow. We tried gluing popsicle sticks together<br/>\n&gt; to make a chair but that flopped.   I&#39;m not an experienced sewer, so<br/>\n&gt; it took me awhile to figure out why the sewing machine wasn&#39;t sewing<br/>\n&gt; when I first started (I didn&#39;t have it threaded exactly right).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alisha needs help organizing her room and one idea we came up with<br/>\n&gt; was making a big doghouse out of cardboard boxes for her stuffed<br/>\n&gt; dogs.  We did that today.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Matt hit his head on the banister and I needed to take care of that.<br/>\n&gt; Luke took a bath and needed me to help him get the water and wanted<br/>\n&gt; me to help him pick out clothes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tomorrow I have to make a dessert to take to a memorial day picnic<br/>\n&gt; and pack up the minivan with extra clothes and stuff we need for the<br/>\n&gt; park.  And I promised Matt we could sew his chair and I have a little<br/>\n&gt; bit of grass to mow and I promised Alisha I&#39;d help her organize her<br/>\n&gt; room, and work on her mighty beanz house some more because sometimes<br/>\n&gt; the mighty beanz are getting stuck when they go down the tubes.<br/>\n&gt; Alisha is low on shorts and I don&#39;t have any bras clean so I need to<br/>\n&gt; do some laundry.  I seem to remember that Luke wanted to do something<br/>\n&gt; tomorrow (probably something to do with Christmas! lol) but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; remember what.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I&#39;m supposed to pursue my own interests when? lol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s all a matter of priorities. Obviously, gardening isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your top priority now and so you&#39;re not gardening (it&#39;s not mine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either ;-).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not a huge priority.  But I started some seeds indoors that will<br/>\n&gt; have to be thrown away because I never had time to plant them<br/>\n&gt; outside. It had me stressed out for awhile, but then I just accepted<br/>\n&gt; that it was okay to plant seeds and not finish the project.  It has<br/>\n&gt; to be.  I did get a few of them planted outside (despite protests<br/>\n&gt; from the kids!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But if gardening was really important to you, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; see anything wrong with saying &quot;I&#39;ll make mighty beanz houses for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; awhile, then I&#39;m going to go garden for awhile. You&#39;re welcome to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bring your mighty beanz and play outside and talk with me while I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; garden.&quot; &quot;(okay, so I have do admit, I have no clue about what<br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mighty beanz things are...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And if they&#39;re not happy with that?  My kids wouldn&#39;t be.  They&#39;d cry<br/>\n&gt; and tell me they hate when I don&#39;t play with them.  If I did it in<br/>\n&gt; spite of their complaints, they&#39;d probably start fighting and someone<br/>\n&gt; would end up crying because they got punched or scratched or kicked<br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;d have to stop gardening anyway to take care of the hurt child<br/>\n&gt; or break up a fight. Or they&#39;d drop a mighty beanz in the grass and<br/>\n&gt; be all upset and need me to search the grass for their mighty bean.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I tend to hang with the kids some of the time, and do my own things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of the time. That might include gardening, exercising,<br/>\n&gt; writing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or internet/email.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of times I start a post and go and finish it an hour or two<br/>\n&gt; later because a kid needs me.   Or I finish what I&#39;m working on<br/>\n&gt; quickly with a kid standing beside me saying, &quot;Come on, when are you<br/>\n&gt; going to be done on the computer?&quot;  I  rarely even unload the whole<br/>\n&gt; dishwasher before I get interrupted and asked to go do something.<br/>\n&gt; Usually I do it in spurts, for 30 seconds or a minute at a time when<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m warming something up in the microwave for someone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I worried about that for awhile. (me and my over-analyzing again!<br/>\n&gt; lol). I would hear people say that they pursue their own interests<br/>\n&gt; and get all kinds of work done while their kids are off playing by<br/>\n&gt; themselves, only asking for adult input once in awhile.   Was there<br/>\n&gt; something wrong that my kids want to spend the majority of their time<br/>\n&gt; with me?  Why does trying to never say no to a request seem to mean<br/>\n&gt; that I spend most of my day doing stuff with or for the kids when for<br/>\n&gt; other people it seems all the kids want is a sandwich here and there,<br/>\n&gt; maybe a board game for half an hour and occasional conversation?  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; getting to the point where I&#39;ve just accepted that we&#39;re all<br/>\n&gt; different, our kids are all different, and the fact that mine need me<br/>\n&gt; a lot just has to be okay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Wow, I&#39;m having a hard time wrapping my mind around that one. I<br/>\n&gt; grew<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up in a fairly small town (1800 people) but there were tons of<br/>\n&gt; places<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to ride bikes to (including the soda shop and ice cream place, of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; course). But there was also the museum, the park, friend&#39;s houses,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;chinese diggin&#39;s&quot; up behind town (old gold mining area where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; treasures could be found), etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No soda shop or ice cream place.  Just turkey hill and a cigar store!<br/>\n&gt; lol  There is a playground.  No library, no museum, and she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have any friends in town.  We have to drive out of town to get<br/>\n&gt; anywhere.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know what age they are, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what about packing a picnic and going on a bike ride together?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We had done that the day before.  I left the younger 2 home with<br/>\n&gt; their dad and went bike riding on a trail with a picnic lunch (we<br/>\n&gt; drove to the trail) with Alisha and her friend and her friend&#39;s mom.<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t do that when I have the younger two with me though, because<br/>\n&gt; they ride slow and can&#39;t keep up with the older ones.  Matt still<br/>\n&gt; needs me to walk beside him and hold onto the handle bars as he<br/>\n&gt; pedals to keep him from falling off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know, to me that&#39;s just part of life. We *don&#39;t* have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; money to buy everything in the world that they might possibly want,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so saying &quot;no&quot; is inevitable. I don&#39;t usually say &quot;no&quot; either. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might say &quot;We don&#39;t have the money for that right now, but you can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; save up for it, or add it to your birthday or Christmas list.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, that&#39;s very true about it being a part of life to not have money<br/>\n&gt; to buy everything in the world.  I usually do the same thing too<br/>\n&gt; (telling them they can save for it or add it to wish lists) but I<br/>\n&gt; wish they wouldn&#39;t act so darn disappointed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And just because I can&#39;t resist, here&#39;s a photo from a couple of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years back of him with his little money belt, pointing out the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; benefits of his plants to some customers at a garage sale:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What a great picture!  Thanks for sharing!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Maybe you could work with her on being proactive? Like walking out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and asking if people need help? I don&#39;t know if she would want to<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that, it&#39;s very hard for some people (kids or adults) to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s not an outgoing person at all.  What I did when she wanted to<br/>\n&gt; try working there was to go with her and when people came up to me to<br/>\n&gt; pay for stuff, I redirected them to her.  So in order for her to<br/>\n&gt; spend a day at work earning money, I had to go to work with her.<br/>\n&gt; That worked out okay on days when dh was off of work to stay with the<br/>\n&gt; younger two, but I couldn&#39;t do that on days when I had the boys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s having a yard sale in a few weeks.  She did that before and<br/>\n&gt; that worked out well for her.  People seem to be okay with paying<br/>\n&gt; kids at a yard sale.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Right now though, toys are made from about the worst type of <br/>\nplastic. It doesn&#39;t biodegrade, can&#39;t be recycled, is manufactured <br/>\nusing all kinds of nasty chemicals, and also leaches these chemicals <br/>\ninto landfills and groundwater when they&#39;re thrown away.

ITA, that simply by making the decision to buy cheap stuff, impulse<br/>\nbuys, whatever, the kids eventually learn valuable lessons without mom<br/>\nstanding over them and lecturing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we&#39;ve been doing here (dd6, dd5 and ds4)  in terms of allowance is a<br/>\nmonthly budget. The girls and I figured out where all the household expenses<br/>\nand what percentages went to each category--we used a pie chart in my excel<br/>\nbudget sheet.  Then we made up envelopes for all the categories relevant to<br/>\nthem--groceries, house, utilities, car, savings, classes, etc. We decided<br/>\nthat each child would get $40 as their monthly budget, out of which they had<br/>\nto pay bills and would keep as personal money whatever was left over. This<br/>\nis what I do, so it made sense that is what they could do. They really enjoy<br/>\ngetting all the money and paying it out--gives them a sense that they are<br/>\nparticipating in important ways towards keeping things together. They like<br/>\nhaving all the bills and different denominations and counting them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, some months, we don&#39;t get the time to do the elaborate ritual, and they<br/>\njust get handed their &quot;budget money&quot; because we&#39;re in the store and they<br/>\nwant something. They know how much they have left over after paying bills,<br/>\nso that&#39;s the amount I give them. They use it for whatever they want, though<br/>\nI still buy them plenty of stuff throughout the month.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn, I understand what you&#39;re saying about plastic money. I pay for<br/>\neverything with my Discover Card, because then we get free books and movies<br/>\nwith our cashback bonus (only &quot;free&quot; if you pay the bill off in full every<br/>\nmonth!). But, here&#39;s a story for forewarning:<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I made the mistake of paying for Julia&#39;s (5) Polly Pockets stuff<br/>\nwith all the other stuff I was buying (our trip to Alabama--buying stuff for<br/>\nthe beach). OMG! You would&#39;ve thought I had pinched her she was crying so<br/>\nhard! She was so devastated that she had to pay me--she didn&#39;t want to pay<br/>\nme, she wanted to pay the cashier. I apologized and offered to return it, so<br/>\nwe could go through the cashier line again. She would have none of it--the<br/>\ndamage was already done! I took away her sense of independence, pride and<br/>\nownership when I bought it with all my other stuff. I wasn&#39;t thinking in her<br/>\nterms, and I will never make that mistake again! All I could do was tell her<br/>\nhow sorry I was and that I would never do that again.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":161248438,"authorName":"Libby Morgan","from":"Libby Morgan &lt;sunshinemommy2001@...&gt;","profile":"sunshinemommy2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] money, allowances and buying kids stuff","postDate":"1085920162","msgId":94899,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTMwMTIyOTIyLjc4OTMxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjYwNDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5Nm9sYitibGNyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94897,"nextInTopic":94901,"prevInTime":94898,"nextInTime":94900,"topicId":94801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello My son is six soon to be seven.

I just<br/>\n&gt; try to buy them <br/>\n&gt; whatever they ask for whenever I can afford it, but<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s still <br/>\n&gt; sometimes hard to say no.  Usually what happens is I<br/>\n&gt; buy them just <br/>\n&gt; about everything they ask for at yard sales and more<br/>\n&gt; often than not <br/>\n&gt; whatever they ask for at thrift shops, and then<br/>\n&gt; sometimes splurge on <br/>\n&gt; stuff at regular stores.  Sometimes I end up<br/>\n&gt; spending more than I <br/>\n&gt; should because I don&#39;t want to tell them no.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They get spending money from their grandparents and<br/>\n&gt; aunt for lots of <br/>\n&gt; holidays.   Valentines day, Easter, summer<br/>\n&gt; birthdays, Halloween, <br/>\n&gt; Thanksgiving, Christmas.  So they get money that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pretty spread out <br/>\n&gt; throughout the year.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But as I look at what we&#39;re doing with money,<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s something I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; not liking.  What&#39;s happening is that they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; ever look for <br/>\n&gt; bargains.  If it&#39;s a bargain, I buy it.  Their money<br/>\n&gt; usually goes <br/>\n&gt; towards impulse purchases at Wal-mart and other such<br/>\n&gt; stores because <br/>\n&gt; they know that I will buy the thrifty stuff.  I feel<br/>\n&gt; that maybe my <br/>\n&gt; current system is keeping them from learning to shop<br/>\n&gt; for bargains, <br/>\n&gt; because the bargains are always taken care of and<br/>\n&gt; their money is <br/>\n&gt; never spent on a bargain.  And maybe it&#39;s putting<br/>\n&gt; too much control of <br/>\n&gt; their choices in my hands.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For example, this week at Wal-mart, I bought them 2<br/>\n&gt; noodles (for the <br/>\n&gt; pool) because ours were getting older and we really<br/>\n&gt; needed them.  I <br/>\n&gt; also spent $20 on a mighty beanz trading card game<br/>\n&gt; (2 decks at $10 <br/>\n&gt; each).  I figured that was all I could afford to do,<br/>\n&gt; and only 2 <br/>\n&gt; people can play at a time anyway, so the whole<br/>\n&gt; family could share the <br/>\n&gt; two decks.  But they each want their own decks (and<br/>\n&gt; want me to have <br/>\n&gt; my own deck so that I can play with them but not use<br/>\n&gt; their cards).  <br/>\n&gt; That would be another $20.  They also want booster<br/>\n&gt; decks which are <br/>\n&gt; extra.  And they each spent the last of their money<br/>\n&gt; on mighty beanz <br/>\n&gt; beans ($5 a pack).  Alisha was able to afford 2<br/>\n&gt; packs and Matt was <br/>\n&gt; only able to afford one.  He was upset.  But in<br/>\n&gt; order for him to even <br/>\n&gt; buy that pack, I had to lend him $3 until he gets<br/>\n&gt; his birthday <br/>\n&gt; money.  Was it okay for me to buy the trading card<br/>\n&gt; game but not the <br/>\n&gt; might beanz toys?  Honestly, I think I made the<br/>\n&gt; decision to buy the <br/>\n&gt; trading card game because I saw that it would<br/>\n&gt; provide a lot of fun, <br/>\n&gt; meaningful time spent together one on one with the<br/>\n&gt; kids but didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; consider the mighty beanz to be as &quot;worthy&quot;.  So I<br/>\n&gt; agreed to buy the <br/>\n&gt; one I saw as more valuable and told them they had to<br/>\n&gt; pay themselves <br/>\n&gt; if they wanted the one I didn&#39;t think was as<br/>\n&gt; valuable.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also said yes to a box of swedish fish candies,<br/>\n&gt; squirtable <br/>\n&gt; imitation cheese stuff, a bag of chips, a pack of<br/>\n&gt; straws, goober <br/>\n&gt; peanut butter and jelly, strawberry jelly, ice cream<br/>\n&gt; toppings, <br/>\n&gt; batteries we needed for toys, and we bought a new<br/>\n&gt; electric ice cream <br/>\n&gt; maker.  I said no to a set of plastic cups Luke<br/>\n&gt; liked because we have <br/>\n&gt; a ton of plastic cups at home.  I said no to 88 cent<br/>\n&gt; candies in the <br/>\n&gt; check out aisle.  Alisha scrounged up the money to<br/>\n&gt; buy herself one <br/>\n&gt; and Luke had money to buy one, but Matt was out of<br/>\n&gt; money and was <br/>\n&gt; upset that they got one and he didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In addition to the wal-mart trip I took them to a<br/>\n&gt; discount grocery <br/>\n&gt; store and gave them $3 a piece to spend on whatever<br/>\n&gt; they wanted.  <br/>\n&gt; Alisha chose to spend $1 on candy and keep the rest<br/>\n&gt; cash.  Luke spent <br/>\n&gt; all of his on candy and Matt spent his on the<br/>\n&gt; gumball and vending <br/>\n&gt; machines.  While at the discount store we saw some<br/>\n&gt; good deals on toys <br/>\n&gt; with damaged boxes ($20 toys for only a dollar or<br/>\n&gt; two), so I also <br/>\n&gt; bought them those.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Over the weekend I got them TONS of stuff at yard<br/>\n&gt; sales.  I spent $40 <br/>\n&gt; just on beanie babies.  I bought them a big<br/>\n&gt; gymnastic mat, games, a <br/>\n&gt; few clothes, books, and some other fun stuff. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also this week I bought Alisha new guitar strings<br/>\n&gt; and paid for her <br/>\n&gt; guitar lessons.  We pay for her monthly online video<br/>\n&gt; game <br/>\n&gt; subscription.  Luke (who&#39;s about to have his 5th<br/>\n&gt; birthday) threw a <br/>\n&gt; fit in the music store because I didn&#39;t buy him a<br/>\n&gt; new electric guitar <br/>\n&gt; right then and there.)  I told him he could play the<br/>\n&gt; acoustic guitar <br/>\n&gt; we have any time he wants, and that I would look for<br/>\n&gt; a used electric <br/>\n&gt; guitar for him. I even had the guitar in the car and<br/>\n&gt; offered to take <br/>\n&gt; him out and let him play the guitar right then and<br/>\n&gt; there, but he <br/>\n&gt; wanted the expensive electric guitar that I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; afford.  And of <br/>\n&gt; course Alisha wants an electric guitar too.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once this week when they didn&#39;t like what I was<br/>\n&gt; making for supper I <br/>\n&gt; went to burger king and got them kids meals, which<br/>\n&gt; they mostly wanted <br/>\n&gt; because of the toys. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alisha needs a belt and I&#39;m taking her to the thrift<br/>\n&gt; store tomorrow <br/>\n&gt; to look for belts, and taking her to a flea market<br/>\n&gt; to get more odds <br/>\n&gt; and ends for her &quot;club&quot;.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alisha needed a special lunch for an outing with<br/>\n&gt; friends, and she&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; been asking for lunchables (very expensive, imo,<br/>\n&gt; especially when all <br/>\n&gt; 3 kids want one!) and I&#39;ve been saying no to that a<br/>\n&gt; lot, so I took <br/>\n&gt; her shopping alone and let her buy a lunchable for<br/>\n&gt; her special lunch. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I shared all that to show that I&#39;m not always saying<br/>\n&gt; no.  I buy them <br/>\n&gt; a LOT, but sometimes they&#39;re still unhappy because I<br/>\n&gt; have to say no <br/>\n&gt; sometimes.  Will they ever get to the point where<br/>\n&gt; they are happy with <br/>\n&gt; what I do buy them and aren&#39;t always wanting more,<br/>\n&gt; more, more?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alisha is upset that she &quot;needs&quot; more money.  She<br/>\n&gt; wants to know what <br/>\n&gt; she could do to get more money.  I thought about<br/>\n&gt; it...she is almost <br/>\n&gt; 11 so there&#39;s nowhere for her to go get a job.  I<br/>\n&gt; told her I&#39;d give <br/>\n&gt; her $5 if she folds all the laundry that&#39;s piling up<br/>\n&gt; in the <br/>\n&gt; livingroom.   I also said maybe I could pay her to<br/>\n&gt; cut grass (We use <br/>\n&gt; an old fashioned push mower so it&#39;s not too<br/>\n&gt; dangerous for her to <br/>\n&gt; use).  Dh and I have toyed with the idea of paying<br/>\n&gt; someone to come in <br/>\n&gt; and cut the grass or do housework but never did<br/>\n&gt; it--but if one of our <br/>\n&gt; kids wants the job, that seems like a good solution.<br/>\n&gt;  But is paying <br/>\n&gt; her to do household stuff going against the thing<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to do <br/>\n&gt; with making chores a natural, joyful part of life? <br/>\n&gt; Would she always <br/>\n&gt; expect to be paid before she&#39;ll do stuff around the<br/>\n&gt; house?  Yet, <br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t I honor her desire to earn money? <br/>\n&gt; Babysitting wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; work because she&#39;s still afraid to stay home without<br/>\n&gt; me and doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; like to go places unless I go along.  My mom said<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;d pay her $10 <br/>\n&gt; plus lunch to come and help her clean for a day and<br/>\n&gt; she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>=== message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.

In fact, my kids are sitting <br/>\nin the living room with friends right now playing with a boatload of <br/>\ncheap plastic crap, LOL, that they got at a garage sale we walked to <br/>\nthis afternoon.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn comes running up in to me in a store having found some toy, and it<br/>\nreally is crappy but she is clearly delighted to have found it, I&#39;m not<br/>\ngoing to give her a lecture about the relative quality standards of this<br/>\nitem compared to some other toy. I&#39;d rather save that kind of discussion for<br/>\nwhen *I* am debating a purchase for myself. She hears me doing price<br/>\ncomparisons, or examining things thoroughly, as well as doing lengthy online<br/>\nresearch. She also is with me when I try on clothes before buying and making<br/>\nreturns of things that aren&#39;t right. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;Really cheap plastic toys make great pool or bathtub toys, and are<br/>\neasily tossed when mildew overtakes them.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow see, I have to disagree with this. We can only afford to do this <br/>\nin the western world because people aren&#39;t doing it all over the <br/>\nglobe. If everyone around the world created, consumed, and tossed as <br/>\nmuch cheap plastic stuff as we do, we&#39;d be buried in the stuff. <br/>\nSooner or later, it&#39;s going to grind to a stop (unless they can <br/>\ninvent biodegradable plastic, in which case we might buy more of it.)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is biodegradable plastic made from corn - the styrofoam type, and also<br/>\n- as I found out when I bought some apples (organically grown) in a package<br/>\n- indistinguishable from ordinary clear hard plastic packaging. I believe<br/>\nthere is also plastic made from soy. Biodegradable plastics can&#39;t always be<br/>\nrecycled, like into sweatshirts - that has to be the coke bottle stuff. And<br/>\nthen it&#39;s windproof.<br/>\n<br/>\nToys, regardless of price, used in the bath are going to become mildewed<br/>\neventually because moisture gets trapped inside them. My experience has been<br/>\nthat yes, soaking in bleach kills it temporarily, but then back it creeps as<br/>\nsoon as the toy is wet. I&#39;m not going to use something other than plastic as<br/>\nbath toys - a big favorite are old pump bottles (from cosmetics eg).<br/>\nEventually it is going to be tossed - trash or the recycling based on<br/>\nlabeling. I carry my own fabric shopping bags, use cloths instead of paper<br/>\ntowels for general cleaning, reuse Ziplocs numerous times until they split<br/>\nor have meat juices, sort my trash, and am thoughtful regarding the<br/>\nenvironment about the purchases I make for the household and myself. In<br/>\nreturn I guess I get to throw away a few small toys that have eventually<br/>\nbecome health hazards without guilt.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know, to me it would feel uncomfortable to have a child whose <br/>\nsadness could only be allayed by purchasing something. Especially if <br/>\nany old cheap piece of plastic crap would do to buy her happiness to <br/>\ncomplete an errand. Now I can see if a child really wants something <br/>\nspecific and then we would talk about when/how they/we could work <br/>\ntowards getting that thing, but just wanting to buy *something* is a <br/>\ndifferent story, to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this occasion Jayn didn&#39;t become upset until I refused to divert to get<br/>\nher a doll. I&#39;m sure she thought it was a perfectly reasonable idea. Often<br/>\nwhen we are going out to the market, I tell her that this is not a toy<br/>\nshopping trip. I like Trader Joe&#39;s because they don&#39;t have toys for sale,<br/>\nunlike Ralphs (Krogers), so those toy impulse buys are lessened. It has to<br/>\nbe a really special toy (the criteria for this are unrelated to $$) for Jayn<br/>\nto want to put it on her birthday or Christmas list - and then she gets<br/>\nupset if we try to buy it for her earlier than that special occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I have to say that recently, a couple of times she has become<br/>\nunhappy about something, then her crying has segued into wanting a new toy.<br/>\nThis has been while we are engaged in our regular activities. It&#39;s a bit<br/>\nbaffling to me, as she has always been allowed and encouraged to express her<br/>\nnegativity, cry as much as she needs to with courteous and sympathetic<br/>\nattention, and I have also learned here to encourage her to breathe for<br/>\ncalmness. I certainly don&#39;t use acquisition to fix my feelings. I&#39;m not sure<br/>\nwhere it&#39;s coming from. Maybe it&#39;s a kind of distraction, and what she<br/>\nreally wants is a change of scene. I&#39;m hoping it will pass, especially since<br/>\nit is just about the least successful strategy for getting a new toy ever<br/>\ndevised. Luckily she is rarely unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much allowance do you give your 4yo, and how did you arrive at whatever<br/>\nthat figure is? <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Right now my passion is unschooling my <br/>\nkids, and if I&#39;m going to do a good job of it, there isn&#39;t time for <br/>\nmuch else.  I expect to have time for different, changing interests <br/>\nas they get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy day today was a typical day. I had little breaks here and there <br/>\nbut needed the breaks to rest, not to go pursue another activity.  <br/>\nCollapse into a chair for some computer time here and there, a shower <br/>\nwhile the boys watched a video, and a short nap when dh got home.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s how it usually goes.  When I get breaks, I need to rest and <br/>\nrecuperate, not dig into a new project of my own, no matter how <br/>\nappealing that project is to me!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI made 2 different mighty beanz houses with the kids and spent 1-2 <br/>\nhours on each one.  Matt&#39;s took the most time because his was 2 <br/>\nstories with an elevator and a fire escape. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday at the flea market my 4 year old asked his grandpa for a 3 <br/>\nft. Christmas tree and decorations, and he got it.  He is absolutely <br/>\nfascinated with Christmas, even in May. ;)  So we went up and got out <br/>\nChristmas videos and books and a few decorations from storage.  I <br/>\nhelped him untangle Christmas lights and made him a cardboard tunnel <br/>\nfor his train track. (His train track was Thomas the tank engine <br/>\ntrack going around the tree.)  <br/>\n<br/>\n2 kids wanted a different kind of koolaid, so I made 2 pitchers of <br/>\nkoolaid.  I ran the dishwasher 2 times and did a load of laundry.  <br/>\nLuke broke a Christmas bulb in the livingroom so I had to clean up <br/>\nthat area and then vaccum where he broke it.  I heated leftovers up <br/>\nfor supper.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMatt wanted furniture for his mighty beanz house--a bed and a chair.  <br/>\nSo we went into storage to go through garbage bags of old sheets and <br/>\nclothes we saved for cutting up and sewing, and he picked out sheets <br/>\nto use.  I had to clean the kitchen table off to get the sewing <br/>\nmachine out, which had gotten pretty cluttered from different <br/>\nactivities in the last few weeks.  I probably spent 1/2 an hour on <br/>\nthat.  Then I sewed a bed for the mighty beanz and a matching sheet <br/>\nfor them to cover up with.  We didn&#39;t do the chair yet so that will <br/>\nhave to wait for tomorrow. We tried gluing popsicle sticks together <br/>\nto make a chair but that flopped.   I&#39;m not an experienced sewer, so <br/>\nit took me awhile to figure out why the sewing machine wasn&#39;t sewing <br/>\nwhen I first started (I didn&#39;t have it threaded exactly right).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha needs help organizing her room and one idea we came up with <br/>\nwas making a big doghouse out of cardboard boxes for her stuffed <br/>\ndogs.  We did that today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMatt hit his head on the banister and I needed to take care of that.  <br/>\nLuke took a bath and needed me to help him get the water and wanted <br/>\nme to help him pick out clothes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow I have to make a dessert to take to a memorial day picnic <br/>\nand pack up the minivan with extra clothes and stuff we need for the <br/>\npark.  And I promised Matt we could sew his chair and I have a little <br/>\nbit of grass to mow and I promised Alisha I&#39;d help her organize her <br/>\nroom, and work on her mighty beanz house some more because sometimes <br/>\nthe mighty beanz are getting stuck when they go down the tubes. <br/>\nAlisha is low on shorts and I don&#39;t have any bras clean so I need to <br/>\ndo some laundry.  I seem to remember that Luke wanted to do something <br/>\ntomorrow (probably something to do with Christmas! lol) but I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember what.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m supposed to pursue my own interests when? lol  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it&#39;s all a matter of priorities.

But I started some seeds indoors that will <br/>\nhave to be thrown away because I never had time to plant them <br/>\noutside.

My kids wouldn&#39;t be.  They&#39;d cry <br/>\nand tell me they hate when I don&#39;t play with them.  If I did it in <br/>\nspite of their complaints, they&#39;d probably start fighting and someone <br/>\nwould end up crying because they got punched or scratched or kicked <br/>\nand I&#39;d have to stop gardening anyway to take care of the hurt child <br/>\nor break up a fight. Or they&#39;d drop a mighty beanz in the grass and <br/>\nbe all upset and need me to search the grass for their mighty bean.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I tend to hang with the kids some of the time, and do my own things <br/>\n&gt; some of the time.

(me and my over-analyzing again! <br/>\nlol). I would hear people say that they pursue their own interests <br/>\nand get all kinds of work done while their kids are off playing by <br/>\nthemselves, only asking for adult input once in awhile.   Was there <br/>\nsomething wrong that my kids want to spend the majority of their time <br/>\nwith me?  Why does trying to never say no to a request seem to mean <br/>\nthat I spend most of my day doing stuff with or for the kids when for <br/>\nother people it seems all the kids want is a sandwich here and there, <br/>\nmaybe a board game for half an hour and occasional conversation?  I&#39;m <br/>\ngetting to the point where I&#39;ve just accepted that we&#39;re all <br/>\ndifferent, our kids are all different, and the fact that mine need me <br/>\na lot just has to be okay.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Wow, I&#39;m having a hard time wrapping my mind around that one.

Understanding my views about the earth, consumerism, <br/>\netc. has not dampened their joy in the least. It was fun to watch <br/>\nthem bargain, compare, combine money with friends, and try to get the <br/>\nmost bang for their buck at the garage sale.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were at the garage sale, one of the kids had to go in and use <br/>\nthe bathroom. The person&#39;s house who was having the sale definitely <br/>\ntook clutter to the extreme. My daughter said &quot;If we bought all that <br/>\nkind of stuff, would our house look like that?&quot; and I said it might, <br/>\nshe said &quot;I&#39;m glad we don&#39;t do that then!&quot; I think, different strokes <br/>\nfor different folks. Both the kids and us appreciate the lack of <br/>\noverall clutter in the house, but they have enough stuff that they <br/>\nare occupied from morning &#39;til night playing, creating, building <br/>\nstuff out of new stuff and old stuff. Yesterday the girls took about <br/>\nan hour making their own shoes from tinfoil, saran wrap, and a ball <br/>\nof yarn. They&#39;ll play with just about anything! I think it&#39;s a nice <br/>\nbalance between having too much stuff, and not enough, and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhere we&#39;re all comfortable.

We can only afford to do this <br/>\nin the western world because people aren&#39;t doing it all over the <br/>\nglobe.

I guess we keep it out of the landfill for a little while <br/>\nlonger. I think it *is* a hard line to walk when value systems <br/>\ncollide (like my values about plastic and consumption colliding with <br/>\nmy values about letting my kids experience the things they want to). <br/>\nWe try to find a good balancing point somewhere in there, but it&#39;s <br/>\nnot always easy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It feels awful to have to tell Jayn that something is really too <br/>\n </span></blockquote>expensive<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for us to buy right now.

Our kids know that we&#39;ve got enough to cover <br/>\neverything that they need - food, house, some toys, and that we have <br/>\nplans that would cover any scenario to make sure that their basic <br/>\nneeds are covered. Not buying them toys every time they ask for them <br/>\nhas not in the least made them worry about money. Our family *was* <br/>\nvery tight on money for a couple of years after 9/11 and they knew <br/>\nthat we had to tighten down on a lot of our spending. They also know <br/>\nthat we have more money now, and can therefore spend more on things <br/>\nwe &quot;want&quot; as opposed to just the needs.

I grew <br/>\nup in a fairly small town (1800 people) but there were tons of places <br/>\nto ride bikes to (including the soda shop and ice cream place, of <br/>\ncourse). But there was also the museum, the park, friend&#39;s houses, <br/>\nthe &quot;chinese diggin&#39;s&quot; up behind town (old gold mining area where <br/>\ntreasures could be found), etc.  I don&#39;t know what age they are, but <br/>\nwhat about packing a picnic and going on a bike ride together? We <br/>\nhave a place that we bike to and eat lunch sometimes, it&#39;s just a <br/>\ngrove of old oak trees out behind the fairgrounds, but we take a <br/>\npicnic there sometimes just for fun, it&#39;s about a mile or so from our <br/>\nhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s not a matter of me determining what I really want/need.

I like it because it lets our kids <br/>\ncontrol where/when/how they spend or save their money. It gives them <br/>\nan idea of worth, value, long-term value, etc. My son, Mackenzie, <br/>\ncalls toys that have been good purchases (that he has continued to <br/>\nenjoy playing with) things that have &quot;sticking power&quot;. Things that <br/>\ndon&#39;t have &quot;sticking power&quot; are those things that are used a few <br/>\ntimes and forgotten. He has started evaluating potential &quot;sticking <br/>\npower&quot; when he makes his purchases. I think that&#39;s a cool thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But <br/>\n&gt; still, I think they will run out of money and ask me to buy them <br/>\n&gt; stuff and I&#39;ll still have to say no, I can&#39;t afford that.  That is <br/>\n&gt; hard for me. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know, to me that&#39;s just part of life. We *don&#39;t* have the <br/>\nmoney to buy everything in the world that they might possibly want, <br/>\nso saying &quot;no&quot; is inevitable. I don&#39;t usually say &quot;no&quot; either. I <br/>\nmight say &quot;We don&#39;t have the money for that right now, but you can <br/>\nsave up for it, or add it to your birthday or Christmas list.&quot; They <br/>\nknow that if it&#39;s something that they really want, they can either <br/>\nbuy it themselves, ask for it as a present for a special occasion, or <br/>\nremind us at some time in the future when we might have more money <br/>\navailable. It&#39;s not really a &quot;no&quot;, but &quot;when circumstances allow&quot;. <br/>\nAlso, even if we did have the money to buy them lots of stuff, our <br/>\nfamily might choose not to in order to do something else. We are <br/>\nhoping to go to Australia next winter, for instance, and will <br/>\nprobably have enough frequent flier miles to get there. But we&#39;ll <br/>\nneed to use some of our available spending money to save up for that, <br/>\nand if we spend it all on random purchases, we won&#39;t get to <br/>\nAustralia. Since the whole family wants to go, it makes it easier to <br/>\nmake decisions about impulse purchases.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What if the kids ask for cheap plastic crap?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They buy it themselves. Or we get it at a yardsale. I&#39;ve explained to <br/>\nthem my principles and reasons for why I feel the way that I do. Like <br/>\nI don&#39;t like to buy things that are made in China, for instance. My <br/>\nmom has not bought a single thing made in China since Tiennamen <br/>\nSquare. I admire that, and &quot;voting with your dollars&quot; is a big <br/>\nconcept for me. I try to make sure that what I&#39;m paying for is <br/>\nsomething that I really want to own (including all the potential <br/>\nnegative consequences of buying it, like supporting governments I <br/>\ndon&#39;t agree with, etc.) I think the kids respect that, just as I <br/>\nrespect the fact that my son turned down BBQ chicken today because he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like the thought of killing animals. We all have different <br/>\nprinciples and make our decisions likewise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So you&#39;re okay with saying no to something they want, with your no <br/>\n&gt; being determined by your values or judgement rather than theirs? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You bet. I don&#39;t limit what they buy with their own money - their <br/>\nvalue system might be different than mine. That&#39;s why they get an <br/>\nallowance because I have no urge to completely control what they <br/>\nspend money on. But as far as what I spend money on, yes I determine <br/>\nit according to my own values. Of course, I try to keep an open mind! <br/>\nI was pretty much against Pokemon (in my own head) when the kids got <br/>\ninto it, but I still rented Pokemon movies for them and took them to <br/>\nplaydates to trade cards, and bought little cardholders to help them <br/>\nkeep their cards, and helped them read the names and information <br/>\nabout the Pokemon. I have to say, the little pocket monsters have <br/>\ngrown on me. So I try to keep my mind open, and we also talk a lot <br/>\nabout these things so that decisions are measured. But yes, the <br/>\nultimate decision on my money rests with me, and theirs rests with <br/>\nthem. If I buy something, I evaluate it according to whether I think <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to use it in the long haul, whether it is made and sold <br/>\nlocally, how environmentally friendly it is, how much we (or the kids <br/>\nwant it) and all sorts of other criteria. Their criteria are their <br/>\nown.<br/>\n    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My kids are very rarely willing to get rid of anything.  We&#39;ve got <br/>\n&gt; LOTS of clutter, but we also use all of it at some point or <br/>\n&gt; another.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing that I realized was that for my kids to become unattached <br/>\nto stuff, I had to be so myself. Having grown up in a pack-rat <br/>\nhousehold, it took awhile for me to look at my possessions and really <br/>\nsee which ones brought me joy and were useful, and which ones I was <br/>\njust moving from shelf to shelf and place to place and were draining <br/>\nme of energy. As I started getting rid of my own stuff, it was easier <br/>\nfor my kids to do so too. That&#39;s just how it happened here. That&#39;s <br/>\nnot to say that there aren&#39;t things that are very valuable to each of <br/>\nus (and in more ways than monetarily) but we try to distinguish <br/>\nbetween the stuff that *is* meaningful and the stuff that is not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s cool.  Who would they sell their plants or soaps to? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, Mackenzie has sold plants at garage sales and kid&#39;s flea <br/>\nmarkets. If they sold soaps, they&#39;d probably sell them there as well, <br/>\nor maybe get a booth at the local Saturday market, or go around to <br/>\nlocal stores and try to convince them to carry the soaps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; been our problem with the kids came up with business ideas--no <br/>\n&gt; market.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are markets everywhere, but you have to go out and find them. <br/>\nOne thing that makes a difference for my son is that he is a born <br/>\nsalesman. When he was selling his plants at the garage sales, he was <br/>\n*working* it. He would stand out in front of his little table and <br/>\napproach people: &quot;Hey, you look like you could use a plant!&quot;, &quot;How <br/>\nabout my ground covers, they save you from weeding!&quot; &quot;Are deer eating <br/>\nyour flowers? I have several deer-resistant varieties!&quot; OMG, he was <br/>\nso cute that I think half of the people buying plants just did so <br/>\nbecause he was really working hard at it. At the kid&#39;s flea market, I <br/>\nheard a lot of the kids complaining that they didn&#39;t do much <br/>\nbusiness, but Mackenzie was one of the few kids I saw who was really <br/>\nout in front of his table *actively* selling. I know that kind of <br/>\npersonality is not in everyone (I am not like this at all), but if <br/>\nyou know how to sell, there is always a market.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just because I can&#39;t resist, here&#39;s a photo from a couple of <br/>\nyears back of him with his little money belt, pointing out the <br/>\nbenefits of his plants to some customers at a garage sale: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exmsft.com/~robinc/May_02_Plant_Sale5_s.jpg\">http://www.exmsft.com/~robinc/May_02_Plant_Sale5_s.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We talked about buying a vending machine to set up in their <br/>\n&gt; grandpa&#39;s flea market.

She really does use the<br/>\ninexpensive stuff just as much as the quality stuff. If it is a question of<br/>\na little treat toy because we are all out together, isn&#39;t it better to buy<br/>\nsomething cheap, and save our money for other things that are more costly?<br/>\nI simply don&#39;t go into the chain stores unless I am willing to buy Jayn a<br/>\ntoy (often our only reason for going!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Jayn can&#39;t see as I do, that something is poorly made, or going to fade<br/>\nor break or not work as advertised, I&#39;m not going destroy her joy in the<br/>\nobject to make some point about consumerism or comparison shopping.<br/>\nSometimes in the past I have warned her that the doll is a bit more fragile<br/>\nthan her Barbies. I do that much less now that she is more likely to point<br/>\nout to me where they are flimsy. But she will still want it! I try to stay<br/>\naway from value judgements since Jayn has her own reasons for wanting<br/>\nthings. I figure an awareness of quality will come in time. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of her favorite toys are little paper people that we cut out and Jayn<br/>\ndecorates with markers - they turn into all kinds of story characters. Jayn<br/>\nsometimes enjoys that some doll&#39;s heads come off easily. Really cheap<br/>\nplastic toys make great pool or bathtub toys, and are easily tossed when<br/>\nmildew overtakes them.<br/>\n<br/>\nStuff gets modified and recombined. A couple of days ago, she took her very<br/>\nbig stuffed unicorn (like a giant floor pillow) and cut it open across the<br/>\nabdomen. She pulled out quite a lot of the stuffing, which spread around the<br/>\narea near the sofa, and turned out to be quite tactile and interestingly<br/>\nslippy underfoot. The next day we both enjoyed sweeping the stuff up with a<br/>\nwhisk broom and pushing it back in. Every day since, I have asked her if I<br/>\ncan sew up the hole, and she says &quot;not yet&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being afraid to tell my mother that one of the legs on my newest<br/>\nbirthday Barbie had come off, because I would have been punished for<br/>\nbreaking it. I wasn&#39;t able to push it back on myself, so I assumed it was<br/>\nirreparable. I played with her for years with an elastic band holding her<br/>\nleg on, feeling frustrated with it, but not daring to ask for another one.<br/>\nIt is only recently with Jayn&#39;s Barbies that I have realized how easy it is<br/>\nto snap the legs back on - if you have adult hand strength. I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nBarbies actually were terrifically expensive to buy in the mid-sixties in<br/>\nHong Kong, or if I was just given that idea by my mother in order to foster<br/>\na sense of gratitude or obligation, and make me not ask for stuff. I never<br/>\nhad candy either - having been convinced that it was all really expensive. I<br/>\nknow better now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels awful to have to tell Jayn that something is really too expensive<br/>\nfor us to buy right now. The other day I was trying to explain that we<br/>\nneeded to save some money for our trip to Disneyland next week, when she<br/>\nwill surely want to buy a doll or two that are not available elsewhere. She<br/>\nwas very unhappy, and started making up all sorts of reasons to not go to<br/>\nDisneyland so she could get a doll now. We were actually in the car on a<br/>\nnon-toy related errand, nowhere near any toy store. She ended up desperately<br/>\nunhappy and wanting to go home, so I put off the errand (non-urgent but<br/>\nstill undone) and brought her home. In retrospect I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t find a<br/>\n99c store on the way and grab a piece of &quot;plastic crap&quot; so that the errand<br/>\nwould have been completed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to walk the line between the truth about what we can afford, and<br/>\nputting our adult &quot;money woes&quot; or different priorities on to her. I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant her to start to worry about money. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a few dollar bills in her little handbag for fun, which she<br/>\nsometimes offers us for candy or something at the market. We let her keep<br/>\nit, and just add the item to the buggy. However I think she is too young in<br/>\nher math understanding for an allowance - all coins are still &quot;quarters&quot;. On<br/>\nthose occasions when it is possible, I show her the price tags and talk to<br/>\nher about how this one toy costs as much as all these toys put together.<br/>\nUsually she will choose quantity over quality, but not always. I suppose it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help that we use debit cards almost all the time instead of cash!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I wanted to plant a ton <br/>\nof stuff out in the yard this year and make tons of stuff from <br/>\nscratch, but there just isn&#39;t enough time because my kids aren&#39;t <br/>\nwanting me to do other stuff. So instead of gardening today, I made <br/>\nhouses for mighty beanz out of cardboard boxes and tubes.  One of the <br/>\nhouses has an elevator!  And after supper we&#39;re sewing pillows and <br/>\nbeds and couches for the mighty beanz houses.  I guess I&#39;ll have time <br/>\nto garden when I&#39;m old and the kids are grown. ;)  I&#39;m pretty <br/>\nsimplicity minded when it comes to buying for myself.  But I also try <br/>\nto not say no to my kids, and they&#39;re NOT very simplicity minded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to go to Walmart-type places very often, but in this case <br/>\nthey specifically asked to go.  So if they specifically ask to do <br/>\nsomething, I try to so yes.  In this case, they heard a friend say <br/>\nthat the next series of mighty beanz was out at Wal-mart.  They <br/>\nwanted to go get some.  And while we were there, they saw other stuff <br/>\nthey wanted.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the same day we went for mighty beanz, we had gotten our electric <br/>\nice cream maker out of the cellar and found that a little bit of <br/>\nwater had leaked from the ceiling above it at some point over the <br/>\nwinter and collected inside the ice cream maker.  The machine was <br/>\nblack and moldy and I didn&#39;t think I could save the ice cream maker <br/>\nand still have it not be a health hazard, so I threw it out and we <br/>\nbought a new one at Wal-mart.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we were at Wal-mart, we also picked up some groceries. I <br/>\nsometimes shop at Wal-mart for food, because I like to buy organic <br/>\nmilk and it&#39;s the only place around that carries it.  And of course <br/>\nwhile I&#39;m shopping, they see lots of stuff.  Can I have this?  Yes.  <br/>\nAnd this?  Yes.  And this?  yes.  This?  I think we have <br/>\nenough.  &quot;Oh, Mom, PLEASE?  I REALLY want it?&quot;  And I feel bad <br/>\nbecause I have to say no. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also on the same day, ALisha had a friend over and they wanted to <br/>\nbike ride to a convenience store for a soda and a snack.  This <br/>\ntradition of wanting to go to this convenience store for a soda and <br/>\nsnacks started years ago when an older friend took her to do that.  <br/>\nAnd now every time she has friends over she asks if they can ride <br/>\nbikes to there.  I think they like to have somewhere to ride bikes TO-<br/>\n-a destination and a purpose for riding, rather than just riding for <br/>\nthe sake of riding.  And that is the only place in town for them to <br/>\nride to except for a playground.  If I could control her mind, I&#39;d <br/>\nchoose for her to not ask to ride bikes to Turkey Hill for sodas and <br/>\nsnacks, but I don&#39;t get to control her desires and she does ask, and <br/>\nmy goal as an unschooler is to say yes as much as possible, so... I <br/>\nsaid okay, we would go there and I would give them each 3.00 to <br/>\nspend.  But her friend didn&#39;t have a bike along and rode Alisha&#39;s, <br/>\nAlisha tried to ride mine and it was too big and hard for her to <br/>\nride.  So they came back home and I said I would drive them, but <br/>\nsuggested going to a discount grocery store instead because they&#39;d <br/>\nget more for their 3.00.  And while we were there, we saw other stuff <br/>\nthat they wanted and asked me to buy for them. Like the nak nak sets <br/>\nand the ball toy that sells at wal-mart for 20 and we got for 2.00, <br/>\nand the mcflurry makers for 2.00.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; helps you look at the money you spend and determine how much of it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for stuff that you really want/need, as opposed to stuff that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you&#39;re <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just buying for various reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a matter of me determining what I really want/need.

One thing that might help is to just limit <br/>\nthe number of times you are someplace where stuff is available for <br/>\nbuying (like Target/Walmart type places), and another thing <br/>\nis to think about when/where/how and why you spend money and what <br/>\nyour emotional attachment to that is. One book that I really liked <br/>\n(in general) about money is called &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;. It <br/>\nhelps you look at the money you spend and determine how much of it is <br/>\nfor stuff that you really want/need, as opposed to stuff that you&#39;re <br/>\njust buying for various reasons. The book really transformed the way <br/>\nDH and I looked at money, shopping, buying (we read it before having <br/>\nkids).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our family, it works like this: The kids each get allowance. It&#39;s <br/>\nenough that they can save up for big things that they want fairly <br/>\neasily, but not immediately, or they can buy smaller things more <br/>\nimmediately. It also fits within our family&#39;s budget for spending <br/>\nmoney. For other stuff, I&#39;m not much of a shopper or buyer of stuff. <br/>\nMy general life principles tend towards not over-consuming, <br/>\nespecially of low quality, low life-expectancy stuff with high <br/>\nenvironmental impact (cheap, plastic crap, in other words). I also <br/>\ntry to avoid shopping at places like Wal-Mart for the same reasons <br/>\n(environmental and community impact). So we just don&#39;t tend to go in <br/>\nstores with stuff (other than groceries) all that often. If we do, <br/>\nthe kids know that I&#39;m unlikely to buy stuff, although that&#39;s not <br/>\nalways true. For instance, I might buy stuff like swim fins, <br/>\nsnorkels, pool toys, or scooters, or add to our board game stash, <br/>\nthough we also like to pick up that stuff at garage sales. Books are <br/>\nalso things I tend to buy, though again I go to our locally-owned <br/>\nbookshop, not a chain. If we do go to a store (like a recent <br/>\nexpedition to Target for Pokemon cards that I bought for the kids), <br/>\nthe kids know that I&#39;m unlikely to browse and make impulse purchases. <br/>\nWe do go to garage sales sometimes too, and to thrift stores, as well <br/>\nas to our town&#39;s Saturday market. The kids are great <br/>\nbargainers/dickerers and will sometimes buy stuff at these places. At <br/>\ngarage sales, I usually give them whatever change I&#39;ve got on me or I <br/>\nwill spring for a bigger purchase if it&#39;s a good deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I grew up in a family of shoppers, in a very cluttery <br/>\nhouse. I don&#39;t like clutter and I don&#39;t like to buy stuff just to be <br/>\nbuying it, and it feels claustrophobic to me to be surrounded by <br/>\nclutter and stuff that&#39;s not being used but just taking up space. In <br/>\nour family, if we choose to invite something to our house, we try to <br/>\nmake sure that it has a place and it is used. If it hasn&#39;t been used <br/>\nin a long time, we usually get rid of it (the kids decide this of <br/>\ncourse, I&#39;ll set out a goodwill box and they&#39;ll put whatever they <br/>\nwant in it, then I set it in the garage for a few weeks, just in case <br/>\nthey have giver&#39;s remorse on some item).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my kids tends to make impulse purchases and buy a bunch more <br/>\nstuff than the other. The other tends to make more considered <br/>\ndecisions and saves up more frequently for something truly needed. I <br/>\nthink that having an allowance lets them figure out saving/spending <br/>\nand their own values more easily than having to ask me for any little <br/>\nthing that they might want. It also cuts down on the &quot;gimmes&quot; at a <br/>\nstore, because they know that if they really want it, they can buy it <br/>\nthemselves. Not to say I don&#39;t sometimes buy things for them (I also <br/>\nkeep a &quot;rainy day&quot; stash of things I&#39;ve found that I know they&#39;ll <br/>\nlove, and I occasionally bring them out when one of the kids is <br/>\nhaving a tough time), but they know it&#39;s not the norm for me to <br/>\nconstantly be buying. Also, as I mentioned in another post, one of my <br/>\nkids has had his own plant-selling business, and both are considering <br/>\na soap-making business this year. They are very into the idea of <br/>\nearning their own money (they&#39;re 7.5 and 4.5). <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just how it works here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-RObin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153142310,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;tri_mom@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: money, allowances and buying kids stuff","postDate":"1085773524","msgId":94829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5ODRzays3MjM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBlMzAwMWM0NDRiNSQxZGY2MzJlMCQwMjAwYThjMEBUaW5rZXJiZWxsPg=="},"prevInTopic":94821,"nextInTopic":94831,"prevInTime":94828,"nextInTime":94830,"topicId":94801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... guys could brainstorm some ideas.

I just try to buy them<br/>\n&gt; whatever they ask for whenever I can afford it, but it&#39;s still<br/>\n&gt; sometimes hard to say no.  Usually what happens is I buy them just<br/>\n&gt; about everything they ask for at yard sales and more often than not<br/>\n&gt; whatever they ask for at thrift shops, and then sometimes splurge on<br/>\n&gt; stuff at regular stores.  Sometimes I end up spending more than I<br/>\n&gt; should because I don&#39;t want to tell them no.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They get spending money from their grandparents and aunt for lots of<br/>\n&gt; holidays.   Valentines day, Easter, summer birthdays, Halloween,<br/>\n&gt; Thanksgiving, Christmas.  So they get money that&#39;s pretty spread out<br/>\n&gt; throughout the year.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But as I look at what we&#39;re doing with money, there&#39;s something I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not liking.  What&#39;s happening is that they don&#39;t ever look for<br/>\n&gt; bargains.  If it&#39;s a bargain, I buy it.  Their money usually goes<br/>\n&gt; towards impulse purchases at Wal-mart and other such stores because<br/>\n&gt; they know that I will buy the thrifty stuff.  I feel that maybe my<br/>\n&gt; current system is keeping them from learning to shop for bargains,<br/>\n&gt; because the bargains are always taken care of and their money is<br/>\n&gt; never spent on a bargain.  And maybe it&#39;s putting too much control of<br/>\n&gt; their choices in my hands.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For example, this week at Wal-mart, I bought them 2 noodles (for the<br/>\n&gt; pool) because ours were getting older and we really needed them.  I<br/>\n&gt; also spent $20 on a mighty beanz trading card game (2 decks at $10<br/>\n&gt; each).  I figured that was all I could afford to do, and only 2<br/>\n&gt; people can play at a time anyway, so the whole family could share the<br/>\n&gt; two decks.  But they each want their own decks (and want me to have<br/>\n&gt; my own deck so that I can play with them but not use their cards).<br/>\n&gt; That would be another $20.  They also want booster decks which are<br/>\n&gt; extra.  And they each spent the last of their money on mighty beanz<br/>\n&gt; beans ($5 a pack).  Alisha was able to afford 2 packs and Matt was<br/>\n&gt; only able to afford one.  He was upset.  But in order for him to even<br/>\n&gt; buy that pack, I had to lend him $3 until he gets his birthday<br/>\n&gt; money.  Was it okay for me to buy the trading card game but not the<br/>\n&gt; might beanz toys?  Honestly, I think I made the decision to buy the<br/>\n&gt; trading card game because I saw that it would provide a lot of fun,<br/>\n&gt; meaningful time spent together one on one with the kids but didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; consider the mighty beanz to be as &quot;worthy&quot;.  So I agreed to buy the<br/>\n&gt; one I saw as more valuable and told them they had to pay themselves<br/>\n&gt; if they wanted the one I didn&#39;t think was as valuable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also said yes to a box of swedish fish candies, squirtable<br/>\n&gt; imitation cheese stuff, a bag of chips, a pack of straws, goober<br/>\n&gt; peanut butter and jelly, strawberry jelly, ice cream toppings,<br/>\n&gt; batteries we needed for toys, and we bought a new electric ice cream<br/>\n&gt; maker.  I said no to a set of plastic cups Luke liked because we have<br/>\n&gt; a ton of plastic cups at home.  I said no to 88 cent candies in the<br/>\n&gt; check out aisle.  Alisha scrounged up the money to buy herself one<br/>\n&gt; and Luke had money to buy one, but Matt was out of money and was<br/>\n&gt; upset that they got one and he didn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In addition to the wal-mart trip I took them to a discount grocery<br/>\n&gt; store and gave them $3 a piece to spend on whatever they wanted.<br/>\n&gt; Alisha chose to spend $1 on candy and keep the rest cash.  Luke spent<br/>\n&gt; all of his on candy and Matt spent his on the gumball and vending<br/>\n&gt; machines.  While at the discount store we saw some good deals on toys<br/>\n&gt; with damaged boxes ($20 toys for only a dollar or two), so I also<br/>\n&gt; bought them those.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Over the weekend I got them TONS of stuff at yard sales.  I spent $40<br/>\n&gt; just on beanie babies.  I bought them a big gymnastic mat, games, a<br/>\n&gt; few clothes, books, and some other fun stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also this week I bought Alisha new guitar strings and paid for her<br/>\n&gt; guitar lessons.  We pay for her monthly online video game<br/>\n&gt; subscription.  Luke (who&#39;s about to have his 5th birthday) threw a<br/>\n&gt; fit in the music store because I didn&#39;t buy him a new electric guitar<br/>\n&gt; right then and there.)  I told him he could play the acoustic guitar<br/>\n&gt; we have any time he wants, and that I would look for a used electric<br/>\n&gt; guitar for him. I even had the guitar in the car and offered to take<br/>\n&gt; him out and let him play the guitar right then and there, but he<br/>\n&gt; wanted the expensive electric guitar that I couldn&#39;t afford.  And of<br/>\n&gt; course Alisha wants an electric guitar too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Once this week when they didn&#39;t like what I was making for supper I<br/>\n&gt; went to burger king and got them kids meals, which they mostly wanted<br/>\n&gt; because of the toys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alisha needs a belt and I&#39;m taking her to the thrift store tomorrow<br/>\n&gt; to look for belts, and taking her to a flea market to get more odds<br/>\n&gt; and ends for her &quot;club&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alisha needed a special lunch for an outing with friends, and she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been asking for lunchables (very expensive, imo, especially when all<br/>\n&gt; 3 kids want one!) and I&#39;ve been saying no to that a lot, so I took<br/>\n&gt; her shopping alone and let her buy a lunchable for her special lunch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I shared all that to show that I&#39;m not always saying no.  I buy them<br/>\n&gt; a LOT, but sometimes they&#39;re still unhappy because I have to say no<br/>\n&gt; sometimes.  Will they ever get to the point where they are happy with<br/>\n&gt; what I do buy them and aren&#39;t always wanting more, more, more?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alisha is upset that she &quot;needs&quot; more money.  She wants to know what<br/>\n&gt; she could do to get more money.  I thought about it...she is almost<br/>\n&gt; 11 so there&#39;s nowhere for her to go get a job.  I told her I&#39;d give<br/>\n&gt; her $5 if she folds all the laundry that&#39;s piling up in the<br/>\n&gt; livingroom.   I also said maybe I could pay her to cut grass (We use<br/>\n&gt; an old fashioned push mower so it&#39;s not too dangerous for her to<br/>\n&gt; use).  Dh and I have toyed with the idea of paying someone to come in<br/>\n&gt; and cut the grass or do housework but never did it--but if one of our<br/>\n&gt; kids wants the job, that seems like a good solution.  But is paying<br/>\n&gt; her to do household stuff going against the thing I&#39;m trying to do<br/>\n&gt; with making chores a natural, joyful part of life?  Would she always<br/>\n&gt; expect to be paid before she&#39;ll do stuff around the house?  Yet,<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t I honor her desire to earn money?  Babysitting wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work because she&#39;s still afraid to stay home without me and doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like to go places unless I go along.  My mom said she&#39;d pay her $10<br/>\n&gt; plus lunch to come and help her clean for a day and she did agree to<br/>\n&gt; that, although she feels torn--she wants the extra $10 but doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to spend the day working for it.  I guess that&#39;s just a real<br/>\n&gt; life choice about how money comes into our lives--deciding if working<br/>\n&gt; all day is worth it for the money you receive.  But she CRIES about<br/>\n&gt; it to me.  If she ends up deciding against the job, she&#39;ll cry that<br/>\n&gt; she really wanted the money.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Should I start an allowance?  And if I start an allowance, how do I<br/>\n&gt; decide when I want to get them stuff just because I want to buy them<br/>\n&gt; stuff and when I should say, &quot;You can get that if you want to spend<br/>\n&gt; your own money on that...&quot;  Like yard sales.  It is REALLY hard for<br/>\n&gt; me to resist buying them something that&#39;s a really good deal. If they<br/>\n&gt; want something and I know they&#39;d have fun with it but don&#39;t buy it,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d have a hard time not getting it for them.  But then they&#39;d know<br/>\n&gt; that they don&#39;t ever need to spend their money at yard sales because<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll always just buy it if they say they don&#39;t want to spend their<br/>\n&gt; money on it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And what if they complain that the allowance isn&#39;t enough?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sheila<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

According to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-371176662\">Your question brings up something I&#39;ve been wondering about.  Have you ever<br/>\nread the book or taken the online test on what you love language is?<br/>\nAccording to the book &quot;The Five Love Languages&quot; people feel loved in<br/>\ndifferent ways.  (or a combination there of)  They are (to paraphrase)<br/>\ngifts, quality time, touch, words of encouragement,  and acts of service. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy question is...what makes one person value gifts more than another.  Do<br/>\nyou feel it is the way people were raised or do you think it&#39;s just how<br/>\npeople are made?  <br/>\n <br/>\nNeither dh or I place a lot of value on gifts.  We don&#39;t give each other<br/>\ngifts very often and neither one of us cares.  We both value quality time<br/>\nspent together the most.  I have a higher value on touch than he does.<br/>\nNeither one of us came from families that could afford to buy a lot of gifts<br/>\n(other than Christmas and birthdays).  Dh&#39;s family is more touch orientated<br/>\nthan mine.  Both of our families enjoyed playing board games and card games<br/>\nwith the children.  In our own family we now value this time spent together<br/>\nmore than anything else.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am the 5th of 6 children.  The first 5 were born close together and we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any extra money for things that weren&#39;t necessary.  The 6th<br/>\nchild was born after the rest of us were on our way to being grown up.  My<br/>\nparents had more money to spend on her and she got designer clothes, lessons<br/>\nof her choice, and more gifts because they could afford it.   She places a<br/>\nlot of emphasis on stuff.  She wants to have the nicest of everything and<br/>\nit&#39;s worth it to her to work for stuff.  None of my other siblings seems to<br/>\nplace half as much value on stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo from the examples I&#39;ve shown in my own life, it seems to me that feeling<br/>\nloved with stuff is a learned behavior or feeling.  Of course, the pool is<br/>\ntoo small to know whether that is true or not.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI give my kids an allowance.  They each get $2 a week to blow as they<br/>\nchoose. (I have one saver and one spender.)   I often buy board games or<br/>\nFrisbees or other things our family will enjoy for two reasons.  They&#39;d<br/>\nnever be able to save for it at the rate of pay they get.  And two, it<br/>\nbenefits our family to have things we enjoy doing together.  The kids are<br/>\nreally appreciative of what they have.  They don&#39;t spend much energy wishing<br/>\nthey had something that someone else has.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf they ask for something once in a while that isn&#39;t too expensive but they<br/>\neither don&#39;t want to spend their money on it or don&#39;t have any, I&#39;ll buy it.<br/>\nIf it would really set the family finances back, I probably wouldn&#39;t.  I got<br/>\nthem hula hoops the other day because one dd&#39;s broke and the other one<br/>\nprobably will soon because they were out all winter and the plastic gets<br/>\nbrittle.  They were $2 so it was no big deal.  I was replacing something<br/>\nthat broke.  They get to have a say on the groceries we buy.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes what we spend money on seems arbitrary to them but we do try to be<br/>\nfair.  Why did you buy this and why won&#39;t you buy that but it does all add<br/>\nup and I explain that to them.  In the end, they have an allowance that they<br/>\ncan save and spend on whatever they choose.  So if I do say no to it, they<br/>\nhave an option to still get it.  We also occasionally let them do a job<br/>\naround the house for money.  If I am feeling like I&#39;d pay someone else to do<br/>\nit and they are willing, I&#39;ll pay them instead.  Both girls were wanting<br/>\nsome extra money this week and they called Grammy to see if she had any work<br/>\nthey could do for cash. She had them pull up a brick walkway (I helped<br/>\nthem!) and she gave them each $10.  They were pleased and so was she.  We<br/>\nworked for an hour and a half on it. She fed us lunch and gave me a flower<br/>\nfor my garden.  :0)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\ngame-enthusiast@...<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: kayb85 [mailto:sheran@...] <br/>\nSent: Friday, May 28, 2004 3:11 AM<br/>\nTo: UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] money, allowances and buying kids stuff<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any input on money situations with kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now my kids don&#39;t have any allowances.  I just try to buy them <br/>\nwhatever they ask for whenever I can afford it, but it&#39;s still <br/>\nsometimes hard to say no.  Usually what happens is I buy them just <br/>\nabout everything they ask for at yard sales and more often than not <br/>\nwhatever they ask for at thrift shops, and then sometimes splurge on <br/>\nstuff at regular stores.  Sometimes I end up spending more than I <br/>\nshould because I don&#39;t want to tell them no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey get spending money from their grandparents and aunt for lots of <br/>\nholidays.   Valentines day, Easter, summer birthdays, Halloween, <br/>\nThanksgiving, Christmas.  So they get money that&#39;s pretty spread out <br/>\nthroughout the year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut as I look at what we&#39;re doing with money, there&#39;s something I&#39;m <br/>\nnot liking.  What&#39;s happening is that they don&#39;t ever look for <br/>\nbargains.  If it&#39;s a bargain, I buy it.  Their money usually goes <br/>\ntowards impulse purchases at Wal-mart and other such stores because <br/>\nthey know that I will buy the thrifty stuff.  I feel that maybe my <br/>\ncurrent system is keeping them from learning to shop for bargains, <br/>\nbecause the bargains are always taken care of and their money is <br/>\nnever spent on a bargain.  And maybe it&#39;s putting too much control of <br/>\ntheir choices in my hands.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, this week at Wal-mart, I bought them 2 noodles (for the <br/>\npool) because ours were getting older and we really needed them.  I <br/>\nalso spent $20 on a mighty beanz trading card game (2 decks at $10 <br/>\neach).  I figured that was all I could afford to do, and only 2 <br/>\npeople can play at a time anyway, so the whole family could share the <br/>\ntwo decks.  But they each want their own decks (and want me to have <br/>\nmy own deck so that I can play with them but not use their cards).  <br/>\nThat would be another $20.  They also want booster decks which are <br/>\nextra.  And they each spent the last of their money on mighty beanz <br/>\nbeans ($5 a pack).  Alisha was able to afford 2 packs and Matt was <br/>\nonly able to afford one.  He was upset.  But in order for him to even <br/>\nbuy that pack, I had to lend him $3 until he gets his birthday <br/>\nmoney.  Was it okay for me to buy the trading card game but not the <br/>\nmight beanz toys?  Honestly, I think I made the decision to buy the <br/>\ntrading card game because I saw that it would provide a lot of fun, <br/>\nmeaningful time spent together one on one with the kids but didn&#39;t <br/>\nconsider the mighty beanz to be as &quot;worthy&quot;.  So I agreed to buy the <br/>\none I saw as more valuable and told them they had to pay themselves <br/>\nif they wanted the one I didn&#39;t think was as valuable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also said yes to a box of swedish fish candies, squirtable <br/>\nimitation cheese stuff, a bag of chips, a pack of straws, goober <br/>\npeanut butter and jelly, strawberry jelly, ice cream toppings, <br/>\nbatteries we needed for toys, and we bought a new electric ice cream <br/>\nmaker.  I said no to a set of plastic cups Luke liked because we have <br/>\na ton of plastic cups at home.  I said no to 88 cent candies in the <br/>\ncheck out aisle.  Alisha scrounged up the money to buy herself one <br/>\nand Luke had money to buy one, but Matt was out of money and was <br/>\nupset that they got one and he didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to the wal-mart trip I took them to a discount grocery <br/>\nstore and gave them $3 a piece to spend on whatever they wanted.  <br/>\nAlisha chose to spend $1 on candy and keep the rest cash.  Luke spent <br/>\nall of his on candy and Matt spent his on the gumball and vending <br/>\nmachines.  While at the discount store we saw some good deals on toys <br/>\nwith damaged boxes ($20 toys for only a dollar or two), so I also <br/>\nbought them those.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the weekend I got them TONS of stuff at yard sales.  I spent $40 <br/>\njust on beanie babies.  I bought them a big gymnastic mat, games, a <br/>\nfew clothes, books, and some other fun stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso this week I bought Alisha new guitar strings and paid for her <br/>\nguitar lessons.  We pay for her monthly online video game <br/>\nsubscription.  Luke (who&#39;s about to have his 5th birthday) threw a <br/>\nfit in the music store because I didn&#39;t buy him a new electric guitar <br/>\nright then and there.)  I told him he could play the acoustic guitar <br/>\nwe have any time he wants, and that I would look for a used electric <br/>\nguitar for him. I even had the guitar in the car and offered to take <br/>\nhim out and let him play the guitar right then and there, but he <br/>\nwanted the expensive electric guitar that I couldn&#39;t afford.  And of <br/>\ncourse Alisha wants an electric guitar too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce this week when they didn&#39;t like what I was making for supper I <br/>\nwent to burger king and got them kids meals, which they mostly wanted <br/>\nbecause of the toys. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha needs a belt and I&#39;m taking her to the thrift store tomorrow <br/>\nto look for belts, and taking her to a flea market to get more odds <br/>\nand ends for her &quot;club&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha needed a special lunch for an outing with friends, and she&#39;s <br/>\nbeen asking for lunchables (very expensive, imo, especially when all <br/>\n3 kids want one!) and I&#39;ve been saying no to that a lot, so I took <br/>\nher shopping alone and let her buy a lunchable for her special lunch. <br/>\n<br/>\nI shared all that to show that I&#39;m not always saying no.  I buy them <br/>\na LOT, but sometimes they&#39;re still unhappy because I have to say no <br/>\nsometimes.  Will they ever get to the point where they are happy with <br/>\nwhat I do buy them and aren&#39;t always wanting more, more, more?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha is upset that she &quot;needs&quot; more money.  She wants to know what <br/>\nshe could do to get more money.  I thought about it...she is almost <br/>\n11 so there&#39;s nowhere for her to go get a job.  I told her I&#39;d give <br/>\nher $5 if she folds all the laundry that&#39;s piling up in the <br/>\nlivingroom.   I also said maybe I could pay her to cut grass (We use <br/>\nan old fashioned push mower so it&#39;s not too dangerous for her to <br/>\nuse).  Dh and I have toyed with the idea of paying someone to come in <br/>\nand cut the grass or do housework but never did it--but if one of our <br/>\nkids wants the job, that seems like a good solution.  But is paying <br/>\nher to do household stuff going against the thing I&#39;m trying to do <br/>\nwith making chores a natural, joyful part of life?  Would she always <br/>\nexpect to be paid before she&#39;ll do stuff around the house?  Yet, <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t I honor her desire to earn money?  Babysitting wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwork because she&#39;s still afraid to stay home without me and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike to go places unless I go along.  My mom said she&#39;d pay her $10 <br/>\nplus lunch to come and help her clean for a day and she did agree to <br/>\nthat, although she feels torn--she wants the extra $10 but doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to spend the day working for it.  I guess that&#39;s just a real <br/>\nlife choice about how money comes into our lives--deciding if working <br/>\nall day is worth it for the money you receive.  But she CRIES about <br/>\nit to me.  If she ends up deciding against the job, she&#39;ll cry that <br/>\nshe really wanted the money.    <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I start an allowance?  And if I start an allowance, how do I <br/>\ndecide when I want to get them stuff just because I want to buy them <br/>\nstuff and when I should say, &quot;You can get that if you want to spend <br/>\nyour own money on that...&quot;  Like yard sales.  It is REALLY hard for <br/>\nme to resist buying them something that&#39;s a really good deal. If they <br/>\nwant something and I know they&#39;d have fun with it but don&#39;t buy it, <br/>\nI&#39;d have a hard time not getting it for them.  But then they&#39;d know <br/>\nthat they don&#39;t ever need to spend their money at yard sales because <br/>\nI&#39;ll always just buy it if they say they don&#39;t want to spend their <br/>\nmoney on it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what if they complain that the allowance isn&#39;t enough?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: http://www.unschooling.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Well, those with no strings attached.  It gives<br/>\nthe control directly to the kids and they learn how to manage their money<br/>\nthemselves.  Maybe not the way I would do it, but the way they want to.<br/>\nWhen kids always have to ask someone else to buy something for them, it may<br/>\nnot really feel like their decision since they don&#39;t have the final say.<br/>\nSure, they can hear the parent explain their decision, but it&#39;s not the same<br/>\nas making the decision themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Was it okay for me to buy the trading card game but not the<br/>\n&gt; might beanz toys?  Honestly, I think I made the decision to buy the<br/>\n&gt; trading card game because I saw that it would provide a lot of fun,<br/>\n&gt; meaningful time spent together one on one with the kids but didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; consider the mighty beanz to be as &quot;worthy&quot;.

If I thought the toys may be an impulse buy<br/>\nand that they may get more play value out of the cards I may remind them to<br/>\nthink about which they think they&#39;d play the most with to help make a<br/>\ndecision.  Not in a judgemental way such that they can tell you obviously<br/>\n&quot;want&quot; them to choose the cards.  But truly giving them the choice which is<br/>\nmost important to them and accepting their decision happily.  And I&#39;d remind<br/>\nthem that they could spend their own money for the other (which you<br/>\nmentioned a couple of them did).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also said yes to a box of swedish fish candies, squirtable<br/>\n&gt; imitation cheese stuff, a bag of chips, a pack of straws, goober<br/>\n&gt; peanut butter and jelly, strawberry jelly, ice cream toppings,<br/>\n&gt; batteries we needed for toys, and we bought a new electric ice cream<br/>\n&gt; maker.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If money is the issue and they really wanted both the cards and toys I<br/>\nlikely would have looked through the cart at the other stuff they had chosen<br/>\nand offered an exchange.  You know, if they chose the cards they could put<br/>\nback other stuff they had picked for about the same value and take the toy<br/>\ninstead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Alisha is upset that she &quot;needs&quot; more money.

I know there are some books<br/>\naround about kids making money, maybe borrow a couple from the library.<br/>\nObviously I don&#39;t know your situation but maybe a paper route, making and<br/>\nselling crafts (eBay? local markets?), maybe babysitting kids at your house,<br/>\nwhat does she like to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I told her I&#39;d give<br/>\n&gt; her $5 if she folds all the laundry that&#39;s piling up in the<br/>\n&gt; livingroom.

I usually list some extra work that needs to be done, not the regular<br/>\neveryday house stuff.  Or if some room has gotten quite out of control and<br/>\nit&#39;s &quot;extra&quot; work to get it back in shape.  I like someone&#39;s suggestion a<br/>\nwhile ago about leaving a list of stuff to be done (maybe with a $ value on<br/>\nit) in the kitchen so they kids can see it any time and go ahead.

It&#39;s like strewing,<br/>\nit&#39;s best to do it without expectations because you realize that stuff you<br/>\nthink they&#39;d be interested in, they aren&#39;t (at least for now).  Same at the<br/>\nstore.  You may see stuff you think they&#39;d enjoy that&#39;s a good bargain but<br/>\nif they&#39;re there and they aren&#39;t interested, let it go.  Or if you think<br/>\nit&#39;s too good a bargain to pass up, or it&#39;ll be hard to find later when, or<br/>\nwhatever reason, realize you are buying it for you.  And then you should use<br/>\nit!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for who buys what, for us it&#39;s not a carved in stone rule &quot;you want it,<br/>\nyou have to buy it&quot;.  My kids realize it also goes hand-in-hand with the<br/>\nfamily budget.  Sometimes we have more money for spending, sometimes not.<br/>\nWhen we have some extra cash I may offer to buy something they are admiring<br/>\nwhen we&#39;re out, or I&#39;ll rent that game, order that pizza etc.  But sometimes<br/>\nwhen they ask about something I&#39;ll tell them I don&#39;t have the money for that<br/>\nright now, that they can pay for it if they have the money, or they can save<br/>\nfor it, or maybe we can split it.  They don&#39;t argue with me at that point, I<br/>\nthink they realize that I am telling them the truth, not using it as a tool<br/>\nto control them and their choices, and they understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"money, allowances and buying kids stuff","postDate":"1085728235","msgId":94801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5Nm9sYitibGNyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94806,"prevInTime":94800,"nextInTime":94802,"topicId":94801,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would appreciate any input on money situations with kids.

And of <br/>\ncourse Alisha wants an electric guitar too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce this week when they didn&#39;t like what I was making for supper I <br/>\nwent to burger king and got them kids meals, which they mostly wanted <br/>\nbecause of the toys. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha needs a belt and I&#39;m taking her to the thrift store tomorrow <br/>\nto look for belts, and taking her to a flea market to get more odds <br/>\nand ends for her &quot;club&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha needed a special lunch for an outing with friends, and she&#39;s <br/>\nbeen asking for lunchables (very expensive, imo, especially when all <br/>\n3 kids want one!) and I&#39;ve been saying no to that a lot, so I took <br/>\nher shopping alone and let her buy a lunchable for her special lunch. <br/>\n<br/>\nI shared all that to show that I&#39;m not always saying no.  I buy them <br/>\na LOT, but sometimes they&#39;re still unhappy because I have to say no <br/>\nsometimes.  Will they ever get to the point where they are happy with <br/>\nwhat I do buy them and aren&#39;t always wanting more, more, more?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlisha is upset that she &quot;needs&quot; more money.  She wants to know what <br/>\nshe could do to get more money.  I thought about it...she is almost <br/>\n11 so there&#39;s nowhere for her to go get a job.  I told her I&#39;d give <br/>\nher $5 if she folds all the laundry that&#39;s piling up in the <br/>\nlivingroom.   I also said maybe I could pay her to cut grass (We use <br/>\nan old fashioned push mower so it&#39;s not too dangerous for her to <br/>\nuse).  Dh and I have toyed with the idea of paying someone to come in <br/>\nand cut the grass or do housework but never did it--but if one of our <br/>\nkids wants the job, that seems like a good solution.  But is paying <br/>\nher to do household stuff going against the thing I&#39;m trying to do <br/>\nwith making chores a natural, joyful part of life?  Would she always <br/>\nexpect to be paid before she&#39;ll do stuff around the house?  Yet, <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t I honor her desire to earn money?  Babysitting wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwork because she&#39;s still afraid to stay home without me and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike to go places unless I go along.  My mom said she&#39;d pay her $10 <br/>\nplus lunch to come and help her clean for a day and she did agree to <br/>\nthat, although she feels torn--she wants the extra $10 but doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to spend the day working for it.  I guess that&#39;s just a real <br/>\nlife choice about how money comes into our lives--deciding if working <br/>\nall day is worth it for the money you receive.  But she CRIES about <br/>\nit to me.  If she ends up deciding against the job, she&#39;ll cry that <br/>\nshe really wanted the money.    <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I start an allowance?  And if I start an allowance, how do I <br/>\ndecide when I want to get them stuff just because I want to buy them <br/>\nstuff and when I should say, &quot;You can get that if you want to spend <br/>\nyour own money on that...&quot;  Like yard sales.  It is REALLY hard for <br/>\nme to resist buying them something that&#39;s a really good deal. If they <br/>\nwant something and I know they&#39;d have fun with it but don&#39;t buy it, <br/>\nI&#39;d have a hard time not getting it for them.  But then they&#39;d know <br/>\nthat they don&#39;t ever need to spend their money at yard sales because <br/>\nI&#39;ll always just buy it if they say they don&#39;t want to spend their <br/>\nmoney on it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what if they complain that the allowance isn&#39;t enough?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94938,"nextTopicId":78753}}
