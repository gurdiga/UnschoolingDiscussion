The major difference being if  you really don&#39;t want to attend you don&#39;t have to. Now, of course there are some classes that may be boring but required for a certain major - but again you still have a choice - I can either drop out or just get through it to move on to the more interesting things. I really thought high school a waste of time for me - but I am still taking college classes and loving them. I have had ones that I didn&#39;t like as much as others, but I figured I would get out of it what I put in. The key is choice and desire. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am enjoying your posts on Kirby. I think its good to see that truly whatever it is that our kids want to do - they can do it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, January 18, 2005 9:54 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] helping Kirby with homework<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is an irritating form of online workbook he needs to do.
