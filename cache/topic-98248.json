They turned out to be a <br/>\nsevere form of epilepsy called &#39;infantile spasms&#39; which lead to <br/>\nmental retardation. Off she went to hospital to start drugs. Drug <br/>\nnumber 1 didn&#39;t work. Nor did drug number 2. Drug number 3 was an <br/>\ninjected steroid called ACTH. She went seizure free after the 2nd <br/>\ninjection. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.<br/>\nShe&#39;s been on it for 4 weeks now and has bloated up. She cries <br/>\nconstantly and her Blood pressure is sky high. So far she has spent 3 <br/>\nweeks in hospital, once for suspected menigitis and then for BP. She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t smile or babble or do anything really but I&#39;ve been told by <br/>\nthose that have been through this that babies on ACTH are like this.<br/>\nWe are hoping that when we finish the drug wean (started yesterday)<br/>\nshe will come back to us and develop like a normal 5 month old baby. <br/>\nIt also makes it impossible to judge how bad her cerebral palsy is <br/>\nalthough we know all 4 limbs are affected. Despite this she is trying <br/>\nto gain head control and can suck and swallow!!! All things the doc <br/>\nsaid she would never do!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thats me.
