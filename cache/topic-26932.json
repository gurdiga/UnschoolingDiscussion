WE felt very safe- police and soldiers are everywhere-plus<br/>\nthousands of people are living and are busy doing their thing.<br/>\n Although ground zero is very sobering(the smoke,the building skeletons, the<br/>\nsmell, and the overwhelming sadness)there still remains an inspiring<br/>\npositive spirit, and it is something to experience- I felt it throughout the<br/>\ncity. I would loved to have stayed longer, and I am glad that we didn&#39;t<br/>\nallow fear to cause us to cancel our trip, because we seriously considered<br/>\ncanceling. It is awesome, cannot wait to return. Can you go?? Maybe that<br/>\nwould put you at ease. I know a wonderful hotel in the area-reasonably<br/>\npriced.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t fly, but I think passengers and flight crews are much more alert<br/>\nand are not going to let anyone get away with hi-jacking a plane. Have you<br/>\nread how several planes have had military escorts, immediate landings,<br/>\nconfetti spilling out of a card and someone reporting it as suspect,<br/>\ntroubled passenger getting restrained by other pax., etc. It seems like<br/>\neveryone is watching everything that used to go mostly un-noticed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWendy<br/>\nOhio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26929,"nextTopicId":26926}}
