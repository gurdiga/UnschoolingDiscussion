One reason is the obvious one in our culture -- as a<br/>\nman, much (too much) of my early self-esteem was tied up in making it in<br/>\nthe &quot;outside world&quot;, and &quot;making it&quot; was often seen (and often<br/>\nincorrectly) as tied to &quot;making it in the school world&quot;.  It has taken<br/>\nme a long time to undo this damage in myself, and I have worked with<br/>\nother men who have come to understand similar damage in themselves.  I<br/>\nwould be careful in asserting that this damage is caused by schools --<br/>\nit is definitely assisted and reinforced by schools -- but I think it<br/>\nhas much deeper cultural roots.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the other reason (and I don&#39;t think this is a bad thing) is that my<br/>\nwife (I think this is cultural too) sees homeschooling as somewhat more<br/>\nprotective of the home and of our daughters and hence is more likely to<br/>\nbe supportive of homeschooling on principle.  I, on the other hand, like<br/>\nhomeschooling because it works for us now, and we don&#39;t see anything<br/>\n(based upon our principles of course) that we like better now, but I&#39;m<br/>\nprobably more open to other possibilities  -- who knows where life will<br/>\nlead us?  Which doesn&#39;t at all detract from my advocacy for<br/>\nhomeschooling -- only that I&#39;m quicker to look at what works best than<br/>\nto defend against what doesn&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert<br/>\n--<br/>\nMy book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in Homeschooling and<br/>\nCommunity-Based Education&quot; will be off the press around September 20.<br/>\nTo read a sample chapter, reviewers&#39; comments, or the foreword, visit my<br/>\nwebsite at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skylarksings.com\">http://www.skylarksings.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"RRAINENJ@xxx.xxx","from":"RRAINENJ@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"kF3SVbs_xsAXrEvvWJ7gtborYgdWBOVURtNKjFl-KRaEk0pd7VmZikd3nYI9CksxCZDPQsJGRw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: men, dads","postDate":"937519536","msgId":2981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMDguMjk4MS45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2975,"nextInTopic":2982,"prevInTime":2980,"nextInTime":2982,"topicId":2969,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/16/99 4:03:00 PM EST, diasberry@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1518371193\">In a message dated 9/16/99 4:03:00 PM EST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diasberry@...\">diasberry@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  in the beginning i explained what i want to do and why i <br/>\n want to &quot;teach&#39; them in the &quot;natural learning&#39; way...he exclaimed &quot;you&#39;re <br/>\n preachin to the choir, i&#39;m with you on this...&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH said the same thing!!

One reason is the obvious one in our culture -- as a<br/>\n&gt; man, much (too much) of my early self-esteem was tied up in making it in<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;outside world&quot;, and &quot;making it&quot; was often seen (and often<br/>\n&gt; incorrectly) as tied to &quot;making it in the school world&quot;.  It has taken<br/>\n&gt; me a long time to undo this damage in myself, and I have worked with<br/>\n&gt; other men who have come to understand similar damage in themselves.  I<br/>\n&gt; would be careful in asserting that this damage is caused by schools --<br/>\n&gt; it is definitely assisted and reinforced by schools -- but I think it<br/>\n&gt; has much deeper cultural roots.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the other reason (and I don&#39;t think this is a bad thing) is that my<br/>\n&gt; wife (I think this is cultural too) sees homeschooling as somewhat more<br/>\n&gt; protective of the home and of our daughters and hence is more likely to<br/>\n&gt; be supportive of homeschooling on principle.  I, on the other hand, like<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling because it works for us now, and we don&#39;t see anything<br/>\n&gt; (based upon our principles of course) that we like better now, but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; probably more open to other possibilities  -- who knows where life will<br/>\n&gt; lead us?  Which doesn&#39;t at all detract from my advocacy for<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling -- only that I&#39;m quicker to look at what works best than<br/>\n&gt; to defend against what doesn&#39;t!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; David Albert<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; My book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me: Adventures in Homeschooling and<br/>\n&gt; Community-Based Education&quot; will be off the press around September 20.<br/>\n&gt; To read a sample chapter, reviewers&#39; comments, or the foreword, visit my<br/>\n&gt; website at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skylarksings.com\">http://www.skylarksings.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
