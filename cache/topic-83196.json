Gramma and Grampa run a successful construction <br/>\nbusiness.  Instead of just handing money or the business over to the next <br/>\ngeneration, they decided to *sponsor* a business for their 13 grandkids (ages 7-21). <br/>\n Business and marketing plans were required.  Research into licenses was <br/>\ndone.  They (the kids) came together and decided that growing and selling pumpkins <br/>\nwas the best idea.  The kids participated and were responsible for every step <br/>\nof the process.  <br/>\nWhen we went to the patch to pick out our pumpkins, there was a presentation, <br/>\nby a 9 & 11 year old team, on how the business came to be, goals of the <br/>\nbusiness, the process of growing pumpkins, stories about pumpkins and pumpkin <br/>\nrelated games.  The pumpkins were sold out by the second weekend in October!  <br/>\nNow Gramma & Grampa didn&#39;t unschool their children, but they fully support <br/>\nthe unschooling of their grandchildren.  Who else could completely understand <br/>\nthat in order to understand business, you have to *be* a business.  That kind of <br/>\nthinking so easily translates into how the unschooling life works.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndiana,<br/>\nThe wackiest widow westriver...<br/>\n&quot;You can follow your book and your map of wars, but I&#39;ll go and follow my <br/>\nkids.&quot; -- Woody Guthrie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83188,"nextTopicId":83211}}
