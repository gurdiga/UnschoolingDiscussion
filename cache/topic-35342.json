My kids are baffled - why would anyone want to watch tv <br/>\nwhen there are friends to play with and interesting things to do? We <br/>\ndiscuss a lot about choosing what to watch on television and making sure <br/>\nit&#39;s worth your time. We also sometimes like it on for background noise, <br/>\nand my eight yo dd and I had a discussion on good channels to put on for <br/>\nbackground noise - she was complaining about the lousy stuff that was on <br/>\nthe kids channels during certain times - so we looked at A&E, History <br/>\nChannel, Discovery and discussed those. Hubby and I tape shows and watch <br/>\nthem when we get a chance and then skip any that don&#39;t hold our <br/>\ninterest. Like a lot of things, there&#39;s good stuff on television and <br/>\njunk. It isn&#39;t evil, isn&#39;t great -- it&#39;s all on how you use it. I&#39;m a <br/>\nnews junkie and a big A&E fan, so I generally put those on when I want <br/>\nsome noise. Hubby goes for espn, oldest likes the animal planet.

His dad is a real<br/>\ntv and movie buff.  But there was a lot of fighting in their house and<br/>\nnot much positive connecting.  So, tv was either a buffer from the<br/>\nfighting or the only way people interracted.  My husband loves his night<br/>\nshows.  I used to not watch tv much, but now I do because I realize to my<br/>\nhusband it means connecting with me.  As a child, I always had unlimited<br/>\ntv, not that I over-watched or underwatched it.  There were times when I<br/>\nwatched a lot and other times I didn&#39;t watch any.  But I can&#39;t stand to<br/>\nhave the tv on all the time, like a lot of people I know do.  It is<br/>\nbecause of the way my mind is, or something.  I cannot not pay attention<br/>\nto it if it is on.  Also, I can&#39;t forget it when it&#39;s over.  I go over<br/>\nand over it again in my mind.  To me, the tv is like going to the<br/>\ntheatre.  When the show is on, it&#39;s got my attention.  I can&#39;t hold a<br/>\nconversation while it&#39;s on.  It&#39;s also very hard for me to follow the<br/>\ndialogue, so I really have to concentrate.  Maybe this is because I read<br/>\nso many books growing up, i.e., I can&#39;t follow an oral dialogue the way I<br/>\ncan a written one.  I used to read excessively, a real bookworm.  (I<br/>\nwould focus all my energy on what I was reading, and go into another<br/>\nlittle universe and have trouble shaking it off when I was in real life. <br/>\nSort of like an actor who can&#39;t get out of character even when he&#39;s not<br/>\nacting anymore.)  Maybe if as a child  tv was taught as a value, good or<br/>\nbad, it would affect one&#39;s viewing as an adult.  But I think enjoying it,<br/>\nhaving it on all the time, hating it, ignoring it, or being hypnotized by<br/>\nit has less to do with whether or not you watched too much of it growing<br/>\nup, and more to do with an individual&#39;s unique tastes and physiology and<br/>\npsychology.<br/>\nBonni  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7793011,"authorName":"Wendy Silver","from":"&quot;Wendy Silver&quot; &lt;wew99@...&gt;","profile":"wew992001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"tv viewing","postDate":"1019284033","msgId":35342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDIwMWMxZTgzNCQ2OGZkZWUyMCQyYzBkOGMxOEBzc3NuZXQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35415,"prevInTime":35341,"nextInTime":35343,"topicId":35342,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I grew up waking and falling asleep to the TV.
