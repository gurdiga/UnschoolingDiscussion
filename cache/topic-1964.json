One daughter age nearly 12.  With September coming up somehow in her mind she has started thinking *school* though we&#39;ve never done that here!!  She says, maybe I need a curriculum....AAAhhgghhh!!!  She does see school children at some of her activities and I am thinking that somehow the school mentality, energy is seeping into her ideas...what else could it be?  A few of these children are going to private schools, skipped grades and are in *gifted* classes.  Alot of the conversation is spent on trying to understand how my dd can possibly learn anything!  Anyway, Joel thanks for the reminder of why the heck we&#39;re doing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Joel Hawthorne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawthorne@...\">jhawthorne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it is a potential way of extinguishing the love of learning which is<br/>\n&gt; at the heart of<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  Pointing out the educational aspects of something is confused to<br/>\n&gt; begin with as is<br/>\n&gt; pointed out below i.e.  everything is educational.  The setting of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;educational&quot; priorities is<br/>\n&gt; something that the learner and the world, interacting together establish.<br/>\n&gt; obedience to authority is one of the main underpinnings of our consumer<br/>\n&gt; /consuming society. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1961,"nextTopicId":1966}}
