Around 7 to 7.2 <br/>\nis neutral....as it rises, it becomes alkaline, as it lowers, it <br/>\nbecomes acidic.  Naturopathic doctors (I&#39;m studying to be one) <br/>\nwould like your pH as neutral as possible.  However, since we eat <br/>\nso many foods which produce acid when metabolized, they usually <br/>\nencourage you to eat as many alkaline foods as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, here is the misconception.....you can take a piece of litmus <br/>\npaper and test an orange, a lemon, etc. and it will test very acidic.  <br/>\nBut the surface pH is not what we are referring to when we say a <br/>\nfood is alkaline or acidic.  It&#39;s the whether that food, when eaten <br/>\nand metabolized, raises or lowers the body&#39;s total pH.  Almost <br/>\nevery fruit and vegetable, when eaten and metabolized, raises the <br/>\npH.  In other words, fruits and vegetables cause an alkaline <br/>\nresponse in the body, just what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh protein foods such as meat and dairy products, and some <br/>\ngrains as well, when eaten produce acidic by-products.  Meat in <br/>\nparticular produces pyruvic acid when it is broken down.  Now if <br/>\nyou take a piece of meat and try to test the pH, you will not get a <br/>\nvery acidic pH.  But after it enters the body and is broken down, it <br/>\nproduces a very acidic response.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what we are talking about when we say something is acidic <br/>\nor alkaline.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie C.

To answer Mary Ellen&#39;s question, even if the pH of the lemon will not sustain life, I&#39;m guessing that ingesting it does not change overall body pH enough to kill us, or the digestive enzymes of the stomach correct it.  The duodenal valve of the stomach opens and releases stomach contents to the intestines when a certain pH is reached.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21141,"nextTopicId":20943}}
