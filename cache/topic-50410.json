An unschooling parent is a <br/>\nfacilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>\nenthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>\nhow of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>\nSquarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>\nabout how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>\nus!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>\n*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>\nlearning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in <br/>\nunschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>\nmind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>\ndesigned to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>\nunschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a <br/>\n&quot;feel&quot; for ths.
