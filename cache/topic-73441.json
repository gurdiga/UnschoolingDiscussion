( again that<br/>\n  &gt; probably sound harsh but these guys will do as little as possible even <br/>\n  &gt; accepting<br/>\n  &gt; punishment rather than help out or even take care of their own things)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, what on earth caused  this perfect, whole, wonderful newborn you had to <br/>\n  become &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;unmotivated&quot;?  I doubt you saw him as a lazy and <br/>\n  unmotivated toddler?<br/>\n  Could it be that punishment and school have actually CAUSED these character <br/>\n  traits, rather than him being a flawed individual. He HAS interests, honor <br/>\n  them.<br/>\n  He is just fine the way he is, he simply needs time to heal. A year off? What <br/>\n  do you have to lose at this point? Obviously the current methods have created <br/>\n  a lazy, unmotivated individual ( I truly, really hope you drop these very <br/>\n  thoughts from your head though) and the best thing you could do to reverse that <br/>\n  damage is to take a year off and focus on being his friend, not punishing him <br/>\n  and getting really excited about the interests he DOES have.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
