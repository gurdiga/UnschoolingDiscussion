I really feel good that maybe I can contribute and not be seen as .. <br/>\n???  anything but helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n I DONT credit &quot;school&quot; with much at all that my kids have learned.. Not <br/>\nreading, not math.. maybe some history and science that they wouldnt have <br/>\nread on thier &quot;own&quot;  but they have only retained what they found interesting <br/>\nin those subjects..   When I hear folks  talk about phonics and teaching  <br/>\nkids to read.. ..even with my kids going to school, that seems like a foreign <br/>\nconcept  to &quot;teach&quot; a kid how to read.   I read to my kids since they day <br/>\nthey were born.  Landon loved it.. from an infant he was entralled with books <br/>\nand being read to..  He would sit for hours and let us ( ask us) to read to <br/>\nhim . He started talking when he was 9 mos old.. ( NO KIDDING) He could carry <br/>\non a converstaion with an adult when he was two.. I mean a REAL conversation. <br/>\n  He started reading pretty much on his own when he was about 5.. I will <br/>\nnever forget.. We had a Richard Scarry story book. . . my first reading book <br/>\nor something.. The first story was.. See See, I see a bee!  Oh Oh.. the bee <br/>\nsees me!   I see the bee and the bee sees me.. ect ect.. You get the idea.   <br/>\nI read the story to him. then , he read to me.  He didnt memorize it. he read <br/>\nit.. He learned the word &quot;see&quot; and then just went from there.. It was easy as <br/>\npie for him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anna was pretty much the same way.. She was reading easily in <br/>\nkindergarten..    I know she had &quot;phonics lessons&quot;  but.. I really dont think <br/>\nthey had anything to do with her learning to read.  <br/>\n<br/>\n Ethan.. I read to him just like the other.. He HATED it.. wouldnt sit <br/>\nstill.. squirmed.. wandered off.. Even if Landon and Anna tried to read to <br/>\nhim. no go.. I continued to read to them. they read to themselves and to each <br/>\nother.. Ethan sometimes joined in for few minutes.. but usually not.   He <br/>\nnever liked books.. Wasnt  interested in reading.  He was tested at 5 ( <br/>\nbecause of some behavioral concerns at preschool)  I was already pretty sure <br/>\nthat he was ADHD.   They said he was about 18 mos behind developmentally... I <br/>\ncould buy that.. he did &#39;act&quot; like he was bout 3 and half a lot of the time.  <br/>\nThey more or less told me.. &quot;He will fail in school, he may not read til he&#39;s <br/>\nolder ( than &#39;average&quot;) he will struggle.. etc etc.. OH GEE THANKS.. what a <br/>\nwonderful label for my child.  Anyway, when he went to school, he couldnt <br/>\nrecognize all of his letters..   But, by the end of kindergarten, he could <br/>\nread.  Was it the phonics?  The &quot;lessons&quot;?  &quot;school&quot; in general?  I dont <br/>\nthink so.  Although, the phonics program that the charter school they <br/>\nattended had a WONDERFUL approach to learning to read. ( which, I am <br/>\nsure.helped a lot, rather than hindered his reading) .. I think he just <br/>\nlearned to read when he was ready.  I never &quot;worked&quot; with him. .Other than to <br/>\ncontinue to read to him.   They didnt have homework at all .. They did send <br/>\nbooks home and we read them together.   He had a teacher sent straight from <br/>\nheaven.  I DO credit a lot of his success to her.. as a person, a loving, <br/>\ncaring, intelligent individual... she was wonderful for Ethan.   Basically, <br/>\nwe got lucky.  He was also fortunate to have her in 1st grade too.  ( I <br/>\nsingle handedly &quot;saved&quot;: my kids school from the sole motivation of Ethan <br/>\nhaving Mrs Douglas again for 1st grade. . another , long story)  Now, Ethan <br/>\nresists reading..  He still doesnt care for books.. He may pick one up and <br/>\nread a few pages, but hes never finished a chapter book.  Books as gifts,  he <br/>\nrolls his eyes..  Library.. hates it.. But, he CAN read.. he just doenst like <br/>\nto.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  JP learned to read much like Anna and Landon. he just did it.. ( he had a <br/>\nteacher from HELL in Kindergarten... I KNOW he didnt learn anything from her) <br/>\n   Hes almost 8 now. and he reads like a typical 8 year old.. He would still <br/>\nrather me read to him aloud. but he will read to me if he really likes a <br/>\nbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think kids are either &quot;wired&quot; for reading and math .. Some &quot;get it&quot;.. some <br/>\ndont.  None of my kids are proficient in math.. Im not either.   Landon didnt <br/>\nlearn his times tables til he was ??? later than 5th grade.. He had the great <br/>\nfortune of skipping the 6th grade. . went straight on in to pre algebra.. and <br/>\ngot to use a calculator.. .. I asked him one day.. Landon, how did you learn <br/>\nyour times tables ?  He said.. I dont know.. over time I guess I just <br/>\nmemorized them. some of them I still dont know.  And, yeah, hes failed in <br/>\nmath.  He failed Algebra 1, part A as a freshmen, and he failed Geometry this <br/>\nyear.  Shrug.. I hate it for him.. mostly because I KNOW he could have passed <br/>\nit if he really tried.(honestly, he didnt do his homework or study,,I never <br/>\nmade my kids do homework). and because its just time &quot;wasted&quot; that he has to <br/>\nrepeat the classes... but it was his choice to fail. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anna is the better than any of the rest of us in math.  But she has been a <br/>\n&quot;model&quot; student in everything.. She loves to do &quot;work&quot;  , loves to &quot;excel&quot; , <br/>\nloves to please and succeed..   Anna should be the poster child for the <br/>\nperfect public school student.   Smart, popular, polite, caring, concerned, <br/>\nevery body loved her from students to staff..  Honestly, I got the most flack <br/>\nfrom everyone for taking Anna out of school.. And, she has hinted several <br/>\ntimes that she wishes she hadnt &quot;quit school&quot;   She&#39;s bored, lonely, <br/>\nunmotivated, and feels quilty and useless.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEthan.. not wired for math or reading.  .. He did pick up reading, I think <br/>\nfrom &quot;exposure&quot;  But, math.. not yet. Im not really worried though.. At least <br/>\nat home hes not being demeaned and berated because he is &quot;behind&quot; or stupid.  <br/>\nEthan likes to build things.. Move things.  Ride things.. He likes speed and <br/>\nmotion.  Hes just got his strengths in different areas.. NOT &quot;academics&quot; per <br/>\nse..  Thats why staying at home, and NOT going to school is wonderful for him<br/>\n<br/>\nJP.. he more like Anna in his &quot;learning style&quot;  he learns pretty easily and <br/>\npicks up stuff with just a little &quot;guidance&quot; and support.. But, hes got the <br/>\nlittle boy peronality that tends more toward playing and having fun than <br/>\n&quot;working&quot; or showing progress.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, I think I just basically rambled on more than answering the question.. <br/>\nBut, the bottom line is.. Although my kids have been in school.. ( and one <br/>\nstill is)  I dont really credit &quot;school&quot; with much they&#39;ve learned at all.  <br/>\nAnna has had some really good times at school.., so has Landon.. But they <br/>\nwere all social things. not academics.AND, yes, they learned &quot;real life&quot; <br/>\nstuff about relationships, interacting, and about society in general.  . They <br/>\nalso had some really good teachers who enriched thier lives and had positive <br/>\ninfluences on them as &quot;really good people&quot;   But, all the busy work, tests, <br/>\nhomework, etc.. theyve done.. basically a waste of time and energy, a source <br/>\nof stress, and nothing but a headache for them and me.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] MNO&#39;s Re: You may be unschooling if.....","postDate":"1044123931","msgId":57544,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3LjM3ZjliOWJhLjJiNmQ2YjFiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57521,"nextInTopic":57551,"prevInTime":57543,"nextInTime":57545,"topicId":57212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/1/03 8:41:27 AM, bunsofaluminum60@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1075999684\">In a message dated 2/1/03 8:41:27 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; This concept seems to <br/>\nbe capturing my imagination, and I&#39;d like to have some input about <br/>\nexperienced homeschoolers making the decision to loosen the reins and <br/>\nlet the kids go for it.
