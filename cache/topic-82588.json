Many clergy today are speaking out <br/>\n&gt; against that<br/>\n&gt; interpretation of scripture. The Reverend Dr. Thomas E. Sagendorf of <br/>\n&gt; Bexley<br/>\n&gt; United Methodist Church in Columbus, OH says the following “I can find no<br/>\n&gt; sanction in the teaching of Jesus or the witness of the New Testament <br/>\n&gt; to encourage<br/>\n&gt; the practice of corporal punishment at home, school or anywhere else. <br/>\n&gt; A number<br/>\n&gt; of popular voices take a different view, often quoting Old Testament<br/>\n&gt; scriptures to prove their point. Those who subscribe to this argument <br/>\n&gt; misunderstand<br/>\n&gt; and misuse scripture. A similar method of selective reading could just <br/>\n&gt; as well<br/>\n&gt; be used to justify slavery, suppression of women, polygamy, incest and<br/>\n&gt; infanticide”.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

What worked for me was the deconstruction of the <br/>\nbible itselfrecognizing how many places I don&#39;t operate on the <br/>\nliteral level with Scripture. A couple examples: I don&#39;t wear a veil <br/>\nor head covering, I still wear makeup and gold jewelry, we don&#39;t <br/>\nbaptize the dead, and we don&#39;t marry our girls off at 14 either. <br/>\nThere is not clear teaching on parenting. There are inferences <br/>\nthat moderns use to create these massive parnetal routines and <br/>\nstructures that probably bear little resemblance to actual <br/>\npractices of the ancient world. (I remember that the Ezzos, for <br/>\ninstance, inferred that Mary must have had Jesus on a schedule <br/>\nbecause she was so busy with first century tasks such as <br/>\ngetting water from the well.... Ugh! That&#39;s the kind of ignorance <br/>\npeddled as biblical parenting that makes me ill.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe supposed biblical mandate for spanking has always <br/>\nseemed suspicious to me because you can be sure that the <br/>\nJews of the OT didn&#39;t take their children into a bathroom with a <br/>\nwooden spoon and follow the steps outlined by Dr. Dobson <br/>\nwhen they smacked their chidlren. children were viewed as <br/>\nmini-adults until Freud. Seriously. Violence against those who <br/>\ndidn&#39;t obey was routine for centuries. There was no internal self <br/>\nto appeal to. External regulation was all that humans knew. <br/>\nEverything has changed since the Enlightenment.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoss Campbell and Dr. Sears (both Christian authors) helped <br/>\nme a lot when I was sorting through these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, I like the book by Dr. Michael Bradley _Yes, Your Teen <br/>\nis Crazy_ which does a great job explaining why parenting <br/>\nmethods by necessity have had to change in the 20th century. <br/>\nHe&#39;s not a Christian though.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as spanking being biblical or notthe OT definitely does <br/>\naffirm its value. What I like to point to is the NT and how Jesus <br/>\nteaches us to treat others. If we insert our children into the <br/>\ncontexts he speaks of, we have a very different approach than <br/>\nspanking. &quot;Turn the other cheek&quot; &quot;Go the extra mile&quot; &quot;Give your <br/>\ncoat&quot; &quot;Bless and curse not&quot; &quot;Do not judge&quot; Even the story of the <br/>\nprodigal son can be read to show that the father is not held <br/>\nresponsible for the rebellion of the son but that his role is <br/>\nforgiver and receiver when the son returns.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few of my thoughts.

Many clergy today are speaking out against that <br/>\ninterpretation of scripture. The Reverend Dr. Thomas E. Sagendorf of Bexley <br/>\nUnited Methodist Church in Columbus, OH says the following “I can find no <br/>\nsanction in the teaching of Jesus or the witness of the New Testament to encourage <br/>\nthe practice of corporal punishment at home, school or anywhere else. A number <br/>\nof popular voices take a different view, often quoting Old Testament <br/>\nscriptures to prove their point. Those who subscribe to this argument misunderstand <br/>\nand misuse scripture. A similar method of selective reading could just as well <br/>\nbe used to justify slavery, suppression of women, polygamy, incest and <br/>\ninfanticide”.<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":63919499,"authorName":"Brian and Kathy Stamp","from":"&quot;Brian and Kathy Stamp&quot; &lt;bstamp@...&gt;","profile":"kathysta","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Can somebody help with a biblical translation","postDate":"1065714429","msgId":82588,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOWUwMWMzOGU3YyQ5OWMxYTcwMCQ5Mzc2ODQ0NUBjYXJvbGluYS5yci5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGJtM2p1citwYzFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":82593,"prevInTime":82587,"nextInTime":82589,"topicId":82588,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I belong to another list where a lady had been asking for help with disciplining her daughter.
