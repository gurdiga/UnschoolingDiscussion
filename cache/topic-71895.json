You came at a good time!!!! I live in FL, just outside of Ft.<br/>\nLauderdale and although my kids are registered with a private school option,<br/>\nI know many who do the evaluations. Some are very relaxed and it&#39;s not hard<br/>\nto get by. First off I should say put all your curriculum crap on E Bay and<br/>\nmake some money back!!! Next, if you belong to a support group, ask around<br/>\nfor an evaluator who is familiar with unschooling or at least very relaxed.<br/>\nThen stock your portfolio full of pcitures from the photo albums of things<br/>\nyou did. Don&#39;t date anything if you can help it. Makes for better looking<br/>\nwith no gaps. The put in a bunch of pictures your son drew and anything with<br/>\nletters or numbers or words on it. Doesn&#39;t have to lool schooly and workbook<br/>\nlike, just in English! If he does anything like building or puzzles or even<br/>\nmaking things out of playdough, take a picture of that too. Once you get<br/>\nstarted, you can pack so much into it, it will look like you&#39;ve been saving<br/>\nfor years!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Hi.
