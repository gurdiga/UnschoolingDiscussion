Sandi , I love your comment about Gatto.  That is *the perfect way to describe him.  When I first read his words I felt like I had heard a voice cutting above the din of a (very negative) crowd, you know?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid, you are sooo right.  I can&#39;t wait to read your book.  We need to hear more of the positive, more of the real.  I look forward to hearing your voice cut above the crowd too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSessuale<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom:\tSandi Chelan [SMTP:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:S-Chelan@...\">S-Chelan@...</a>]<br/>\nSent:\tMonday, August 09, 1999 12:30 AM<br/>\nTo:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\nSubject:\tRe: [Unschooling-dotcom] I&#39;m new here<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sandi Chelan&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:S-Chelan@...\">S-Chelan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSessuale and David!<br/>\nGatto&#39;s book saved my sanity when we were deciding to homeschool.

Sessuale here :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Just a quick thought.  I&#39;m a vet unschooler but new to this list and I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have been experiencing a little chaos of my own (computer chaos that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is).  At any rate, this is my first op to speak up.  I just wanted to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; say that I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.  In fact your sentiments<br/>\n&gt;&gt; reminded me of a wonderful book:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Dumbing Us Down.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Susan if you read nothing else this summer, read this.  It made me<br/>\n&gt;&gt; really stop and think.  It strengthened my resolve and made me proud<br/>\n&gt;&gt; of my choices and remember I&#39;m a former homeschooler myself!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear Sessuale -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It does my heart proud that you liked Gatto&#39;s book.  I was the editor<br/>\n&gt;and publisher (I&#39;m the one with the note in the front), and I think the<br/>\n&gt;book is even better today than when it came out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In about six weeks, my own book on our homeschooling experiences will be<br/>\n&gt;out (published by New Society Publishers/Holt Associates) -- it was<br/>\n&gt;interesting to homeschool being very conscious in advance of Gatto&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;critiques, so I hope it will be seen as building on his work.  The book<br/>\n&gt;will be called &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me:  Adventures in<br/>\n&gt;Homeschooling and Community-Based Education&quot; (I finished the proofing<br/>\n&gt;this weekend.)  Chapters will appear on my website:<br/>\n&gt;www.skylarksings.com  (which won&#39;t be up until September 5 or so.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;David Albert<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;ATTN ONELIST USERS: stay current on the latest activities,<br/>\n&gt;programs, & features at ONElist by joining our member newsletter at<br/>\n&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/onelist_announce</a> &quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate a list for FRIENDS & FAMILY...<br/>\n..and YOU can WIN $100 to Amazon.com.
