No joke. Sometimes I forget what the rest of the world (the<br/>\nnonunschooling part of it) is really like.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe schools here last week had a four hour orientation on Saturday for<br/>\nmiddle-schoolers (6th grade). Four hours? To know how to find a locker and<br/>\nwhere your classes are? Without parents, of course. And without what you<br/>\nreally need to know to survive middle school, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic school started here yesterday. I hugged my six year old until she<br/>\nasked me what was going on and I told her I was so glad she was here and not<br/>\ngone on a school bus at 7 a.m. She still doesn&#39;t have the concept that we<br/>\nhomeschool; when people ask her where she goes to school, she&#39;ll mention the<br/>\nenrichment classes she takes. What we do here, that&#39;s just fun, for her (and<br/>\nfor me!)<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40936,"nextTopicId":40942}}
