This woman<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt;   the grocery store one day, she yanked her kid by<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;   braid so hard I think that kid&#39;ll have permanent<br/>\n&gt; neck<br/>\n&gt;   problems if she keeps it up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   But, all this talk of violence in movies leads to<br/>\n&gt; ask<br/>\n&gt;   what you all think of guns in the house? We don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt;   guns, but my ex-husband, my kids&#39; dad, is a cop.<br/>\n&gt; They<br/>\n&gt;   do NOT play with toy guns because they need to<br/>\n&gt; KNOW<br/>\n&gt;   guns are not toys, since he has to have a gun for<br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt;   job. And they aren&#39;t allowed to play at houses<br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt;   guns. Except their own dad&#39;s house. But being a<br/>\n&gt; cop,<br/>\n&gt;   he&#39;s seen plenty of kids killed in accidental<br/>\n&gt;   shootings, so he keeps that gun away from where<br/>\n&gt; anyone<br/>\n&gt;   can get at it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I used to ask, when arranging playdates, do you<br/>\n&gt; have a<br/>\n&gt;   gun in your house? But now that they&#39;re older and<br/>\n&gt;   arrange their own social lives, more or less, I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;   slacked off. And the other day, my daughter came<br/>\n&gt; home<br/>\n&gt;   and said that she and Kaylee had been playing<br/>\n&gt; Easter<br/>\n&gt;   Egg Hunt at Kaylee&#39;s house. It was the day before<br/>\n&gt;   Easter, and they hid rocks and pretended they were<br/>\n&gt;   eggs. So, Aubrey went to open a cedar chest to<br/>\n&gt; look<br/>\n&gt;   for eggs in there, and it was locked. Kaylee said,<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;Oh, that&#39;s where my dad keeps his guns.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   So here&#39;s my problem. What if it hadn&#39;t been<br/>\n&gt; locked?<br/>\n&gt;   Is it always locked? Does Kaylee know where the<br/>\n&gt; key<br/>\n&gt;   is? Does Kaylee&#39;s older (and scary) brother know<br/>\n&gt; where<br/>\n&gt;   the key is? Are the guns loaded? Are the bullets<br/>\n&gt; kept<br/>\n&gt;   locked with the guns? If not, are the bullets<br/>\n&gt; lying<br/>\n&gt;   around where kids can get them? If the bullets are<br/>\n&gt;   locked separately, do the kids know where THAT key<br/>\n&gt; is?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   So I said no more playing at Kaylee&#39;s house. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt;   rare thing, anyway. Kaylee&#39;s parents are rarely<br/>\n&gt; home,<br/>\n&gt;   and she probably spends more of her waking, out of<br/>\n&gt;   school, hours here than she does there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I just read a book called Evening News that got me<br/>\n&gt;   thinking about this. In it, a boy accidentally<br/>\n&gt; shoots<br/>\n&gt;   his sister when his friend takes out his dad&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; gun.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;From a LOCKED drawer. The boy knew where the key<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt;   hidden. Anyway, the book is about how the family<br/>\n&gt; falls<br/>\n&gt;   apart. It&#39;s a good book, but sad. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Juli<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   =====<br/>\n&gt;   You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help<br/>\n&gt; him to find it within himself --Galileo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;   Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;   Yahoo!

Recently they witnessed \n<br>the father of a friend (12) chase him around the yard screaming that he was \n<br>going to kill him, while waving a belt (btw....I had a case worker from \n<br>social services here on Monday, because there was an incident of sexual \n<br>misconduct from a boy on our street and she ended up here as part of her \n<br>investigation, since the younger 2 boys played with this boy and she was here \n<br>a month ago and came back to give the 4 boys some materials on sexual abuse \n<br>and to talk about it with them and while she was here I told her about the \n<br>incident, made a formal complaint. I have a &quot;relationship&quot; with social \n<br>services because of the above incident as well as because a neighbor called \n<br>on me because the boys don&#39;t go to school and I cooperated with the case \n<br>worker while she was here, the case was marked unfounded) and my boys could \n<br>not believe that any parent would treat their child like that for being 10 \n<br>min. late. It upset them greatly.\n<br>\n<br>Also..we watch movies as a family which many wouldn&#39;t consider &quot;family \n<br>movies&quot; and my dh and both swear, quite a bit. The boys probably swear around \n<br>their friends but never have around us.\n<br><p ALIGN=\"CENTER\"></p></font><font COLOR=\"#008000\" SIZE=\"6\" FACE=\"Minya Nouvelle\"> </font><font

The other night they watched Gladiator and<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; thought that the historical info. they soaked in was well worth the few<br/>\n&gt; violent scenes.  Now I have more of a problem with shoot em ups and  that<br/>\n&gt; type of violence but when it comes to war movies and such I overlook a<br/>\nlot.<br/>\n&gt; Also language doesn&#39;t bother me either, my mother drives me nuts about<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; one, because my kids know what bad words are.....they don&#39;t repeat them<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; because they heard them in a movie.......and I think they would miss out<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; a lot of good movies just because of that.  So yes, my 8 & 6 yo&#39;s have<br/>\n&gt; watched Aliens, The Patriot, The Matrix, etc...  I just would like to know<br/>\n&gt; how other people.........especially unschoolers......handle this.

However, in recent years, I have thought that maybe <br/>\nour kids are exposed to too much violence in movies, even the ones with a <br/>\ngood message, and especially the ones where violence ends up to be the only <br/>\nsolution to the problem in the movie.

They just relented and watched ET a<br/>\nmonth ago. So we don&#39;t have the problem of wondering<br/>\nif movies they want to see are too violent or sexy or<br/>\nwhatever. But we don&#39;t have TV, so maybe they&#39;re<br/>\nlimited exposure to those sorts of images keeps them<br/>\nhorrified by what we would be horrified by in real<br/>\nlife. I&#39;m really sensitive myself. I don&#39;t like to<br/>\nwatch strangers have sex in real life, and I don&#39;t<br/>\nlike it on the screen. And any violence that would<br/>\nscare me in real life bothers me on the screen. That&#39;s<br/>\njust us, I suppose. We&#39;re sensitive in lots of ways.<br/>\nSo sorry, I know I haven&#39;t answered your question, but<br/>\nmaybe I&#39;ve let you see your friends&#39; point of view. I<br/>\nmean, if their kids are sensitive, they might think<br/>\nyours are, too, you know?

Besides, my 9 yo learned the infamous &quot;F&quot; word from the neighbor kid and promptly taught it to his 5 yo brother.  I don&#39;t even worry about the language in their movies anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nViolence:  Same.  They watched several &#39;children&#39; movies that have children verbally and physically abusing each other and, at least, the implied abuse from adults.  And what about all the dark, dreary violence in the cartoon movies?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys don&#39;t watch horror or the heavy blood and guts, then we don&#39;t watch them either.  Otherwise... The evening news is more sickning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe down side:  Words get repeated and sometimes at inappropriate times.  We do what any other parent would do, I guess, I tell them it doesn&#39;t sound nice coming from anyone, no matter their age.  I say the same thing when I slip.  But, like I said, they didn&#39;t learn everything from the movies either.  Also, I wonder if some of their physical aggression towards each other may have been promoted by the shows, but I remember my brothers having knock-down punching battles back when tv was, supposedly, less violent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like tv (although I love those animal, nature, and geography shows) because it seems so passive and does not challenge thinking, but I don&#39;t think the guys are going to falter in their steps forward because of tv/movies.  I think they are intelligent enough to figure it out and I&#39;m willing to clarify things when needed (ie. the 5 yo needed some explanations with why there were dinosaurs in Jurassic Park if all the dinos were extinct).  <br/>\n<br/>\nKandi<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nI would love to ask opinions here about something.........<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 8 and 6 and I let them watch movies some of my friends would stroke out over if they knew.  The other night they watched Gladiator and I thought that the historical info. they soaked in was well worth the few violent scenes.  Now I have more of a problem with shoot em ups and  that type of violence but when it comes to war movies and such I overlook a lot. Also language doesn&#39;t bother me either, my mother drives me nuts about this one, because my kids know what bad words are.....they don&#39;t repeat them just because they heard them in a movie.......and I think they would miss out on a lot of good movies just because of that.  So yes, my 8 & 6 yo&#39;s have watched Aliens, The Patriot, The Matrix, etc...  I just would like to know how other people.........especially unschoolers......handle this.  My kids don&#39;t have nightmares, they don&#39;t dwell on the violence, they ask questions sometimes and we discuss it but then they move on.

In fact, the oldest can hardly wait for &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; to<br/>\ncome out next month. Both my dh and I answer all their questions, if they have<br/>\nany about any movie they watch. We explain to them how movies are made, costumes<br/>\nare applied and how cartoons are not real. Neither of the two have nightmares<br/>\nthat attribute back to any movies so far. Both of their favorites, to date, have<br/>\nbeen any of the Dinosaur related movies (including Jurrassic Park both 1 & 2,<br/>\nGodzilla, Godzilla 2000, any of the Land Before Time series, & most recently,<br/>\nDisney&#39;s Dinosaur). I try to have all my movies explained in some fashion that<br/>\nit becomes a learning process.  My oldest is currently focusing on weather this<br/>\nweek. We talk about tornadoes and the most popular states for having them, their<br/>\ndescruction levels, etc. The movie, Twister, is also watched then and discussed.<br/>\nWe have found several errors already on the movie.
