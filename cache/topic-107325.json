She agreed to help keep <br/>\nthe nursery while I taught a class for the week and my older <br/>\ndaughter Sarah was in a class and my younger daughter Olivia was to <br/>\nbe in the nursery with Noelle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first day of VBS Olivia didn&#39;t want to stay in the nursery and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t force her.  We went in and out through the morning as our <br/>\nschedule allowed but mostly she stayed with me.  At one point Olivia <br/>\nwas eating a snack in the nursery and stayed there without me for <br/>\nabout 20 minutes.  I looked in to check on her and she was crying.  <br/>\nI immediately took her out.  Noelle told me, &quot;Olivia is the only <br/>\nproblem.  All of the other kids are doing fine.&quot;  I said, &quot;Olivia is <br/>\nnot a problem.&quot;  Noelle replied, &quot;Well, she is a Mama&#39;s baby.&quot;  I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;There is nothing wrong with that.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater on in the morning Olivia wanted to play again in the nursery <br/>\nand I left her for about 20 minutes and checked on her twice during <br/>\nthat time.  The second time I looked in she was listlessly sitting <br/>\nwith her blankie and sucking her fingers.  She saw me through the <br/>\nwindow and brightened up when I motioned for her to come to the door <br/>\nand go with me.  Noelle immediately rushed to the door and, while <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t say anything, it was clear from her facial expressions <br/>\nand her tongue clicking that she didn&#39;t approve.  I said, &quot;I know <br/>\nyou don&#39;t approve of my parenting, but I am taking her out.&quot;  She <br/>\nsaid nothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t leave Olivia in the nursery again the rest of the week.  <br/>\nShe stayed with me in my class and was my little helper.  She <br/>\ncolored and cut when she was bored by the class and she handed out <br/>\npapers and sat with me when she was interested in what we were <br/>\ndoing.  She was fine and she didn&#39;t disturb my class in the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Wedsnesday of our VBS week my older daughter Sarah was very <br/>\ntired.  (We are not used to getting up early and having to be <br/>\nsomewhere and follow an agenda!  Thankfully, it was only for a week!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah said she didn&#39;t want to go to class that day.  I told her she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to that she could sit with me in my class and take it <br/>\neasy or help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle came downstairs to breakfast and Sarah told her she wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to class.  Noelle said, &quot; But you have to go.  You should <br/>\nfinish what you start.  You need to go, just for the experience.&quot;  I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Sarah, you don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to do.&quot;  <br/>\nNoelle said, &quot;But she has to go.  She should finish what she <br/>\nstarts.  That&#39;s what I was taught and that&#39;s what I think.&quot;  I <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I don&#39;t really care what you think.  Here&#39;s what I think.  I <br/>\nthink this visit is not going well and I think you need to call your <br/>\nparents and change your flight.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt badly about saying this to her but I was also relieved.  I <br/>\nwanted her gone because of her constant challenges to our way of <br/>\nlife, her rudeness (everything I did and said was wrong and could be <br/>\ntweaked or improved).  I had told her earlier in the week that I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t used to being critized and judged all of the time, that my <br/>\nkids still thought I was pretty great.  This got no response from <br/>\nNoelle. The understanding about homeschooling that she had had a few <br/>\ndays earlier seemed to have vanished.  I guess all of her beliefs <br/>\nwere being challenged on too many levels at once.<br/>\n<br/>\n She had also been &quot;shushing&quot; Sarah and telling her to be quiet.  <br/>\nWhen I asked her to stop this Noelle said,(in front of Sarah), &quot;But <br/>\nshe is too loud.&quot;  My reply was, &quot;This is her house.&quot;  Anyway all of <br/>\nthis is a roundabout way of saying there was a lot of stuff leading <br/>\nup to my saying, &quot;You need to go home.&quot;  It was one thing to <br/>\nconsider when she was disturbing my peace but when she disturbed my <br/>\nchildren--it was time for her to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of 2nd installment.  Next, the truth comes out, a tearful <br/>\nconfession, and I call Noelle&#39;s parents.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107315,"nextTopicId":107330}}
