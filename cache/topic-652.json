I&#39;ve got my 5 1/2 year old and a 3 1/2 year old.  My oldest one<br/>\nis about to start first grade level stuff... my 3 year old, is<br/>\npre-preschool.. hehe :)  The only way I can deal with homeschooling my older<br/>\none while having my younger one around is I have things for him to do that<br/>\nare as similar to his brother as possible.  He has papers that he writes on<br/>\nwhile we do spelling and writing, he does flash cards with his brother (he<br/>\njust has to tell me what the color or picture is of, where his older brother<br/>\ntells me what letter it starts with or something along that line),I will<br/>\nalso switch them working on the computer as well... one will play for 30<br/>\nmins and then it&#39;s the other&#39;s turn, usually schoolish style of programs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for time for myself... well, that&#39;s extremely difficult in this<br/>\nhousehold.  I&#39;m a single mom and we live with my mother and older sister.<br/>\nThere&#39;s not a lot of chances for me to have time to myself.  My mother does<br/>\nhelp out and watches the boys for me as often as she can... but I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto take advantage of that either.   It&#39;s a hard thing to do, to find time<br/>\nfor yourself, time for friends or anything else... but I feel it&#39;s worth the<br/>\nlittle bit of sacrifice now.  They won&#39;t be with me forever, and if I can<br/>\nraise two good men for this world... then it will be well worth my LOONG<br/>\nvacation after they are on their own... LOL!!  hehehehe... I&#39;m gonna do<br/>\neverything in MY power to make sure these two boys are independently<br/>\nwealthy!! hehehe, then I&#39;ll go.. ya know I think  you two owe me a<br/>\nretirement!  hehehehe  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine - Pomona, Ca.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -Wesley has a 2 year old sister (Very 2!).
