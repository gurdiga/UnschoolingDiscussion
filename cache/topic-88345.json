Both children clearly have a good ear and a passionate relationship<br/>\nwith music and violin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two questions i&#39;d welcome feedback on.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Today, while sitting in on the lesson (sometimes i stay, sometimes i do<br/>\ngroceries) I again noticed how much the teacher praises. She really does it<br/>\nquite a bit and says things like &quot;That was excellent!&quot; or asks things like<br/>\n&quot;Now doesn&#39;t that feel good when you play it without mistakes?&quot; things i<br/>\nwould never say and wish she wouldn&#39;t either. Despite this, she is really a<br/>\ngreat teacher--she&#39;s young and hip and very creative and down-to-earth and<br/>\ninspires the kids with her own obvious love of music, fiddling etc. Above<br/>\nall, they both absolutely adore her and feel very safe with her (she&#39;s the<br/>\nonly &quot;stranger&quot; I&#39;ve ever been able to leave my 2.5yo with!). i really like<br/>\nher too. She has a special relationship with Ayden and she has kept him on<br/>\nas a student even while cutting other more experienced students when she<br/>\nreduced her schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen the praising interfere with Ayden&#39;s learning or his<br/>\nenthusiasm (yet) and in some ways i hate to get in there when it&#39;s all going<br/>\nwell and he&#39;s happy, *but* i also feel uncomfortable with the praise and<br/>\nsomewhat &quot;schooly&quot; language. I sometimes think she only does this because<br/>\nshe thinks she &quot;should&quot; and that she would be open to learning how to do it<br/>\ndifferently. She&#39;s been very open to my input so far and i know i can talk<br/>\nwith her but want to be succinct, specific and helpful. She also gives<br/>\nstickers, which Ayden loves (the stickers) but i don&#39;t like her giving them<br/>\nfor &quot;good playing&quot;  even if his playing is always &quot;good&quot;. Any thoughts of<br/>\nhow i could quickly and easily explain why i&#39;d rather she didn&#39;t use praise<br/>\nas &quot;motivation&quot; and how she could speak instead? Or should i leave it alone<br/>\nas it doesn&#39;t appear to bother ds?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Practicing. I&#39;ve spoken with the teacher about this and told her that i<br/>\nwill not force Ayden to practice and after a year of watching his enthusiasm<br/>\nwhile other kids drifted off, she really got it and encourages but doesn&#39;t<br/>\npush it. However, we all see (including Ayden) how quickly and noticably his<br/>\nplaying improves when he practices. He says he would like to practice more<br/>\nand wants my help because he doesn&#39;t always think of it but i&#39;m not very<br/>\norganised and have baggage about being nagged to practice so i tend to just<br/>\nshy away, often forget and am not very helpful in this regard. Could someone<br/>\nshare with me really concrete ways they help their children to remember<br/>\npracticing in a way that really respects their integrity and natural<br/>\nlearning?<br/>\n<br/>\nTHanks!<br/>\ningrid</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88433,"nextTopicId":88442}}
