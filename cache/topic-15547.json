The camp is in Southern California, near Big Bear, please see the <br/>\nwebsite listed below.  I know some people came from Arizona before.  The <br/>\nfood is wonderful and filling (they do vegan and vegitarian too!), the <br/>\npeople are great, the events are always fun, and if they aren&#39;t what you <br/>\nwant to do you can do something else, take a nap, or go for a walk.  <br/>\nNothing is manditory.  The swimming pool will be open as will the hot <br/>\ntub (not for the kids, Lexie hates that!) The mountains are great, fresh <br/>\nclean air, and great water.  The drive, from LA or OC, isn&#39;t that bad, <br/>\nwithout traffic we can make it in about 1 hour and 45 minutes, even <br/>\ngoing up the mountain!  Even with me now teaching school I am figuring <br/>\nout a way to be there at least for part of it, with Mark being there the <br/>\nentire time.  It is so worth the money!  If you have any questions, <br/>\nemail Caroline below.  Or I suppose you can ask me. <br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;We hold the Camps for Homeschooling Families about 3 times a year.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Our next<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;two camps are scheduled for Monday, September 22 - Thursday, September 25,<br/>\n &gt;2003 and a Holiday Camp on Saturday, December 6 - Thursday, December 11,<br/>\n &gt;2003.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;Anyone interested in the December camp can go to the camp&#39;s web site at<br/>\n &gt;www.uucamp.org.
