When I ask them<br/>\nabout it, they don&#39;t really seem<br/>\nto know why they watched it again.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to say something about this.  Even people who make children&#39;s<br/>\nshows know that they like to watch the same things over and over.  On<br/>\nthe Teletubbies they even have them saying &quot;Again, again&quot; after watching<br/>\nthe video on one of their telly tummies and then they show the same<br/>\nvideo again.  Just like children - they are children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids used to ask to see the same videos over and over, have the same<br/>\nbooks read to them over and over (The Little Prince, Harriet the Spy,<br/>\nHoles, any book from the Series of Unfortunate Events series, etc...),<br/>\ntell them the same stories about me or their father as children over and<br/>\nover, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nI read books that I really enjoy over, sometimes 3 or 4 times (Catcher<br/>\nin the Rye, Mists of Avalon, Autobiography of a Yogi, etc...)  There&#39;s<br/>\nnothing abnormal about it, it&#39;s what people do.  I&#39;ve seen Camelot at<br/>\nleast 4 times, Hair countless times, Love and Death 15 times in one<br/>\nsummer, About a Boy twice, Matrix twice, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople like to watch and read things that interest them, I do, so does<br/>\nmy husband and so do my kids.  I wouldn&#39;t want some one telling me that<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t watch McClintock (is that how it&#39;s spelled?) again.  Just<br/>\nlike I&#39;m not going to tell my kids not to watch Star Wars for the<br/>\numpteenth time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho loves to own movies just so she can watch them again</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62254,"nextTopicId":62244}}
