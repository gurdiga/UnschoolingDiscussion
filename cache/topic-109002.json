It is a documentary for the non- <br/>\nunschooing public, not conceived of as something useful for  <br/>\nunschoolers or potential unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t think it would be particular great at convincing a spouse  <br/>\nor in-laws.

I know it would have been more  <br/>\nof a turn-off for my dh, not an inspiration to want to BE like them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying there is anything negative about those people featured  <br/>\nin the film - they&#39;re great, interesting, articulate, etc. Two of the  <br/>\nthree families in the documentary are friends of mine and the third  <br/>\nwas really interesting, too. But the film-maker chose them and chose  <br/>\nto feature them as unusual, quirky, a bit eccentric. Which they ARE,  <br/>\nof course, and that&#39;s WONDERFUL and inspiration to ME, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nthinking that a spouse, who already thinks this unschooling stuff  <br/>\nsounds a bit too weird, might be more turned off than convinced by  <br/>\nthe video.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband turned out to be an unexpectedly conventional kind of guy  <br/>\nwho likes to &quot;fit in&quot; to society way more than I care about.  <br/>\nWhodathunk it? He came to this country from Iran, a member of a tiny  <br/>\nminority religion that believes in equality of women and men, an end  <br/>\nto racism - very very progressive. I thought he was a risk-taker,  <br/>\nunconventional type of person - but I think he&#39;d USED up his  <br/>\nadventurous spirit just getting here and marrying ME! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo once he was sort of settled in, finished school, good job, married  <br/>\nwith children, homeowner, in a community with good schools -- he was  <br/>\nset and happy. &quot;I,&quot; on the other hand, was still the same person who  <br/>\nhad studied in a field not much open to women,  joined a tiny  <br/>\nminority religion, married a guy from Iran - still a person who LIKES  <br/>\nto do the quirky, different thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo unschooling appealed to that part of me, while my husband is still  <br/>\ncompletely bewildered by it. He&#39;s never actively fought it - but he  <br/>\nhad to &quot;just trust&quot; me. Never &quot;got it.&quot; Can&#39;t really quite understand  <br/>\nhow this all happened - how the kids turned out so &quot;okay.&quot; He&#39;d have  <br/>\nliked to have had them in school, winning accolades that he could  <br/>\nbrag about to other parents, especially at work. It is hard for him -  <br/>\nhe can&#39;t say to the guys at work, &quot;Oh, well, MY 14 year old spends  <br/>\nmost of her time hanging around at a karate studio with mostly older  <br/>\nguys, playing RISK. That is, when she isn&#39;t sleeping late because she  <br/>\nstays up half the night IMing with online friends. He could say she&#39;s  <br/>\ntaking &quot;college courses,&quot; but he&#39;d have to &quot;admit&quot; that those courses  <br/>\nare &quot;musical theater&quot; and &quot;piano&quot; classes.

When someone is just starting <br/>\nout  I tell them just to start their day by asking their kids what <br/>\nthey would like to do that day, and then do that. I would follow up <br/>\nthat activity by asking &#39;what sounds interesting to do next?&#39;, Or I <br/>\nwould offer several suggestions/choices and let them choose. The <br/>\nother thing I tell them is that when their kids ask to do something <br/>\njust say yes more.  I remember I would think &#39;is there any real <br/>\nreason why they can&#39;t?&#39;, and if there wasn&#39;t I would say yes.  These <br/>\nare small changes that you can do even if hubby isn&#39;t on board yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith other lifestyle issues like food, just offer them lots of <br/>\nchoices, if your tradition has been set meal times, don&#39;t just scrap <br/>\nthat.  Instead just ask your kids questions like what sounds good for <br/>\nlunch etc...  With bedtimes, I would just say would you like to watch <br/>\nthe rest of the program, not you don&#39;t have a bedtime anymore.  You <br/>\ncan evolve into this over time.

But then if we were not unschooling he would be the more permissive parent in that area. &lt;g&gt; Unschooling was foreign to Darin, he didn&#39;t get it and constantly questioned me. He would even sabotage (right word?) things when he got home. He would ask me what I did for school with the kids today. He would ask the kids math and spelling questions. So taking a page from other matters in our marriage I snuck unschooling up on him. Quietly, unassuming. Darin isn&#39;t a big reader, he does like to read, just doesn&#39;t have the time or energy. So taking that into consideration I would email him articles from Sandra&#39;s and others web sites. I would leave books laying around with paragraphs highlighted. And I never, ever said things like &#39;did you get my email?&#39; or &#39;did you read such and such in that book I left open on your pillow?&#39; I just sent or left and didn&#39;t mention. If he brought it up or asked a question, fine,<br/>\n great! And I rarely mentioned the word unschooling, to us that was almost a catalyst. I would talk about all the things the kids and I did during the day, and quietly guide schoolish conversations into other, more productive matters. I didn&#39;t argue with him or contradict him in front of the kids or otherwise. When he asked the kids schoolish types of questions I would say things like &#39;did you know that today Jack kept the shopping list and read from it for me while Moly kept the price book and calculator and kept us in our budget?&#39; And my kids aren&#39;t quiet about their accomplishments. A few years ago my mom gave Jack a bunch of wood projects, bird houses and such. Lots of instructions, measuring, cutting... not one of those pre cut kits. He had to do most of the work himself. That was impressive for Darin, who when he saw the gift, thought it was more for someone in a high school shop class than a seven year old. <br/>\n <br/>\nNow six years later if you were to spend a day with us, (a day Darin is here that is) you would probably think he is the more unschoolish of us. And yes it did take years. You can probably deschool a child in a few months to a year, depending on the length of time spent in school. You can deschool your self in about the same amount of time, maybe a bit longer, but someone who is resistant it can take years. But those years can be good. Keep it low key, keep things non-confrontational. You have to be THE example. Take a cue from the moderators of this group. When things get too far away from unschooling topics and become more about schoolish or whatever things, they gently guide the group back on track. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca Benson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rjpbenson@...\">rjpbenson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI know this was written to someone else, but...My husband knows that I don&#39;t agree with his views on a lot of unschooling issues and he knows that the kids are aware of this, but what gets messy is that he wants certain rules, like &quot;No TV before 3pm,&quot; or &quot;No video games before 5pm&quot; enforced by me while he is at work all day.

Make it clear why you want to unschool and give him some articles and stuff to read but keep in mind and let him know that this is not to convince him, but to help him understand why it&#39;s important to you. Then ask what he thinks are important issues surrounding homeschooling and parenting and take his concerns seriously. Then you guys need to work out some compromises. My DH just won&#39;t go for no bedtimes. So we have a &#39;quiet time&#39; where my kids can go to their room by a certain time and read or play in bed until they&#39;re ready for sleep. That covers his need for time alone and with me and leaves the kids in control of their sleep. Not ideal but it works reasonably well for now. And down the road, who knows? He&#39;s loosened up on a LOT in the two years we&#39;ve been unschooling and really enjoys a lot of the perks now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Back up, take a breath and regroup. If your prime concern is for your kids then your desire to unschool should NOT be threatening your marriage. If it&#39;s a good and healthy relationship then it would just be cruel to your children to break it up over this. You&#39;re in a partnership. You guys HAVE to negotiate this stuff. You have to listen to his concerns respectfully and help shape some compromises that will address both of your concens. And you won&#39;t get to lift limits and all that right away. It just won&#39;t happen if he&#39;s as opposed as it seems. But take smaller steps. Give him time. Remember, I&#39;m two years in and bedtimes are still something we have to compromise on.
