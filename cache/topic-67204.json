The second time, there were the three :( <br/>\nregulars and another new kid.  Luckily, we newbies have felt right at home <br/>\nand are completely comfortable with just 6 kids (sometimes 7) in RE.  They&#39;re <br/>\nall aged 4 to 9 and we do one program including all of them.  The parents <br/>\nusually take turns doing the programs for the kids, though I&#39;ve begun asking <br/>\nothers [who I find interesting] to contribute to our children, as well.  We <br/>\ndo UU Principles every-other week with a fun crafty project [or just playing <br/>\nsoccer] in between.  My kids have no problem being the only homeschoolers, <br/>\njust as they have no problem being the only ones with a dead dad ;)  We got <br/>\nthe UU&Me magazine for the first time ~ how blessed we were to have a topic <br/>\ncovered that my children know so well (death) and for it to be talked about <br/>\nin a *this is how SOME people believe* format.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and I wanted to tack this on ~ How could you not LOVE a church that says <br/>\nthis:  <br/>\nGrateful for the religious pluralism which enriches and enables our faith, we <br/>\nare inspired to deepen our understanding and expand our vision.
