I went with her to the Dr <br/>\nwhen she found out she was pregnant   We came back to my house and went in my <br/>\nbedroom.  My mom came and gently knocked on the door.  I let her in and she <br/>\nasked what was wrong.  My friend ( and I , too) was crying.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nhesitate for a minute.. I said.. &quot;Dawn&#39;s going to have a baby&quot;  Moma teared <br/>\nup too and she sat down on the bed and hugged Dawn, and said, &quot;oh, <br/>\nsweetheart, it&#39;s going to be OK&quot;.  We all had a good cry, and Dawn asked Moma <br/>\nif she would call in to her work to tell them she was sick.  Mom did it.  <br/>\nThat was it.  No lecture to me, no warnings of  &quot;dont hang arond her&quot;   The <br/>\nextent of Mom&#39;s input about the situation was to ask me how Dawn was doing <br/>\nand to talk to me about how I felt about it and how it affected Dawn.   Never <br/>\na passing of judgement or a waiver of trust in me.  How wonderful<br/>\n<br/>\n    Dawn had a good mother too, but she was still scared to tell her she was <br/>\npregnant.  She didnt tell her family til she was 4 months along, and by then, <br/>\nher mom had figured it out herself.   They didn&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;disown&quot; her or <br/>\nanything like that.. They supported her and helped her didn&#39;t demand that she <br/>\nmarry her boyfriend.   But, her boyfriends parents said, ABORTION or <br/>\nMARRIAGE!  Thier son was not going to have a bastard child.  So, they got <br/>\nmarried and spent 10 years in a terrible marriage til they got divorced.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I rambled as usual.  sorry.. I can never keep it short<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! Groups Sponsor<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I went with her to the Dr <br/>\nwhen she found out she was pregnant   We came back to my house and went in my <br/>\nbedroom.  My mom came and gently knocked on the door.  I let her in and she <br/>\nasked what was wrong.  My friend ( and I , too) was crying.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nhesitate for a minute.. I said.. &quot;Dawn&#39;s going to have a baby&quot;  Moma teared <br/>\nup too and she sat down on the bed and hugged Dawn, and said, &quot;oh, <br/>\nsweetheart, it&#39;s going to be OK&quot;.  We all had a good cry, and Dawn asked Moma <br/>\nif she would call in to her work to tell them she was sick.  Mom did it.  <br/>\nThat was it.  No lecture to me, no warnings of  &quot;dont hang arond her&quot;   The <br/>\nextent of Mom&#39;s input about the situation was to ask me how Dawn was doing <br/>\nand to talk to me about how I felt about it and how it affected Dawn.   Never <br/>\na passing of judgement or a waiver of trust in me.  How wonderful<br/>\n<br/>\n    Dawn had a good mother too, but she was still scared to tell her she was <br/>\npregnant.  She didnt tell her family til she was 4 months along, and by then, <br/>\nher mom had figured it out herself.   They didn&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;disown&quot; her or <br/>\nanything like that.. They supported her and helped her didn&#39;t demand that she <br/>\nmarry her boyfriend.   But, her boyfriends parents said, ABORTION or <br/>\nMARRIAGE!  Thier son was not going to have a bastard child.  So, they got <br/>\nmarried and spent 10 years in a terrible marriage til they got divorced.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I rambled as usual.  sorry..

Not long ago I <br/>\noffered Will (9) a chance to go somewhere where no one could hear us, and <br/>\nscream out all the cuss words we could think of as many times as we wanted.  <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t take me up on it, because he was kind of shocked at the suggestion. <br/>\n He began to see them in a new light.  We got to talk a lot about what words <br/>\nthat are appropriate in a given situation.  I told him he could get them all <br/>\nout any time he wanted, just to let me know and I&#39;d clear a path for him.  It <br/>\nseems like they hold a special fascination for kids around this age.  They <br/>\nthink about them and hear other people say them, and eventually they&#39;re using <br/>\nthem when adults aren&#39;t around.  It&#39;s like a dirty little secret.  I say <br/>\nbring it out in the light of day, and let them taste the words and feel and <br/>\nhear them in their own voice  Take all the sting out of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day he said he was being spun on a swing by the neighbor kids (12 <br/>\nand 11) and he was so excited and enthralled he said shhhhhhhhhhh.....it!  I <br/>\nknow it was about impressing the older boys, but I had to warn him about what <br/>\nthose older boys&#39; mother&#39;s reactions would be if they heard him saying that <br/>\nin front of their 3 yo sister.  With 4 adults in our house, Will&#39;s heard them <br/>\nall anyway.  I will not shame him if I hear one out of his mouth. <br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3899762,"authorName":"coyote&#39;s corner","from":"&quot;coyote&#39;s corner&quot; &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"calourojm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] boys,drugs,and cussing!!long,,sorry","postDate":"1051626483","msgId":66586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4MmUwMWMzMGU1YiQ4YjY1MjNlMCQ2ODAxYThjMEBBb3Blbj4=","referencesHeader":"PGI4bDNmbCs3ZmRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8M0VBRTg5MUUuOTA1MDcwNEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":66504,"nextInTopic":66614,"prevInTime":66585,"nextInTime":66587,"topicId":66494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think you should have stayed on the phne.

Well, since you asked, my take on this situation is that your son was handling it just fine without your intervention.  Ratting the boy out to his loser parent was probably the worst thing you could have done IMO because the boy thought of your home as his safe place now he probably feels that he&#39;s not safe with you either.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do NOT encourage that your son show anyone where the pot is.  It&#39;s not his business and I see it as being made to &quot;prove&quot; (in his mind) that he&#39;s a &quot;good&quot; boy.  I hope that made sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as the cussing goes..... why do you care???  He wasn&#39;t saying anything to YOU and &quot;sh!t&quot; is hardly a word to get worked up over.  LOL  Besides, do you think that his friend would even hear him if your son talked like Mr. Rodgers or something?  ;)  He&#39;s talking in 13yo-boy-ese.
