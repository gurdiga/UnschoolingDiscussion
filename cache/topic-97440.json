It is an inclusive magazine, not only for and by <br/>\nexperienced homeschoolers, but also for and by those just starting <br/>\ndown the path. It embraces those who are radical in their <br/>\nunschooling methods and those who are less so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking for parents and children involved in home education <br/>\nto contribute material to the magazine. Live Free Learn Free strives <br/>\nto bring home educating families together by publishing articles, <br/>\nstories, poems, letters, reviews, and other items written by <br/>\nhome/unschooling parents and children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe prefer contributions written in the first- or third-person (I/we <br/>\nor she/he/they) to those written in the second-person (you). <br/>\nSubmissions focused on the readers&#39; own experiences most closely <br/>\nreflect the spirit of the magazine.  There is no requirement for <br/>\nword length. Simply say what you have to say.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d like to receive, on an ongoing basis, articles or letters about <br/>\nwhat works (or doesn&#39;t work) for you as home educators: lifestyle <br/>\nchoices (such as bedtimes, chores, meals, etc.), curriculum/non-<br/>\ncurriculum choices, resource reviews, etc., as well as glimpses into <br/>\nthe days and ways of an unschooling family. This is a recurring <br/>\nsection of the magazine. Tell us what it means to you to be an <br/>\nunschooler. What obstacles have you encountered? What advantages <br/>\nhave you discovered? This area of the magazine has a very broad <br/>\nfocus, so tell us what&#39;s on your mind! For those who need a bit more <br/>\ninspiration, here are a few topics we&#39;d like to cover in upcoming <br/>\nissues:<br/>\n<br/>\nCollege? <br/>\nUnschooling the special needs child <br/>\nRural unschooling <br/>\nSupport groups <br/>\nConferences <br/>\nStructure <br/>\nLate readers <br/>\nRole of technology <br/>\nActivism and unschooling <br/>\nMath anxiety <br/>\nWhen kids want to try school <br/>\nCamp <br/>\nUnschooling teens <br/>\nDeschooling <br/>\nUsing community college <br/>\nApprenticeships <br/>\nTraveling and unschooling <br/>\nSingle parents unschooling <br/>\nUnschooling large families<br/>\nUsing the community <br/>\nUnschooling shy children <br/>\nTesting <br/>\nJobs/work for kids <br/>\nRelinquishing &quot;control&quot; <br/>\nUnschooling the only child <br/>\nSocialization <br/>\nLabels (ADHD, LD, Etc.) <br/>\nWhen spouses disagree about unschooling <br/>\nT.V. <br/>\n&quot;Failing&quot; <br/>\nUnschooling on the cheap <br/>\nBoth parents working <br/>\nWhen they want to try school <br/>\nDealing with criticisms of unschooling <br/>\nDeschooling for parents <br/>\nReporting to school authorities <br/>\nQuitting <br/>\nEveryday math/science/language/art/etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubmissions may be sent to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:folkypoet@...\">folkypoet@...</a>. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first issue has been printed and is being readied for mailing.  <br/>\nTo learn more about the magazine, to subscribe, or to find detailed <br/>\ninformation about submission procedures or ad rates, please visit <br/>\nour website at www.livefreelearnfree.com. <br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nShana Ronayne Hickman<br/>\nwww.livefreelearnfree.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97418,"nextTopicId":97401}}
