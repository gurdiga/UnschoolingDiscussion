And thanks for all of the <br/>\nsuggestions re: getting cheap paper.  We do have tons of typing paper <br/>\nand leftover computer paper.  I come from a teaching family (I&#39;m the <br/>\nfirst girl to not only graduate college w/out a teaching degree, but <br/>\nthan choose to homeschool) Try picturing how well that sits.<br/>\nAnyways, we get lots of leftovers from their classrooms.  I think <br/>\nthey use the drop ins as a opportunity to see what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I meant by wasting was drawing an itty  bitty lady bug and <br/>\ngetting a new sheet.  I just prefer that they realize paper does cost <br/>\nus in trees and use the other side also.  I don&#39;t care if they get <br/>\nfrustrated and crumple it up or throw it away.  But utilize the whole <br/>\nspace, unless of course they are making a book or magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that for some of you this might be nitpicking but in the <br/>\npast year I have seen 5 forests timbered near us just for profit. Not <br/>\nfor ill trees.  These are areas where nothing new has been planted <br/>\nand the land isn&#39;t for sale.  Just harvested.
