I&#39;m just not sure there is anything that <br/>\ncan be done about that.  It is an incomfortable and scary idea and people <br/>\nhave strong reactions to it and sometimes that is expressed in anger.

THAT is the message <br/>\nthat Kate wasn&#39;t seeming to hear. I don&#39;t blame her - I think we are <br/>\nsometimes sort of too reticent to say it - out of a sense of courtesy, <br/>\nbelieve it or not &lt;G&gt; - not wanting to tell other people that we think that <br/>\nwhat they are doing could be harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think people here were hearing perfectly well what she was saying - that <br/>\nshe allows a lot of freedom and child-determined time and pays attention to <br/>\nwhether her kids are wanting to continue the lessons, etc. That&#39;s nice. It <br/>\nbeats the heck out of making the kids sit at the table in tears until they <br/>\nfinish their math curriculum every day. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I think I said in another post, I have a friend who uses Calvert <br/>\nCurriculum and calls herself an unschooler. I don&#39;t correct her, much less <br/>\nberate her - not ever. But if SHE wanted to talk about unschooling, I&#39;d tell <br/>\nher what I thought, that what she was doing was absolutely contrary to what I <br/>\nbelieve is the whole POINT of unschooling. I&#39;d tell her what Kate was hearing <br/>\nhere - that if you do school stuff that it isn&#39;t unschooling just because you <br/>\ndo it flexibly and nicely and because the kids have lots of other free time <br/>\nto learn stuff their own way in between the lessons. It is nice - nicer than <br/>\nrigid, meanspirited schooling - way nicer. But unschoolers STILL see it as <br/>\npotentially harmful. Why?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, it is absolutely CRITICAL that no &quot;lessons&quot; are being imposed on the <br/>\nkids. To me, the whole point of unschooling is to avoid the unintended <br/>\nconsequences of schoolish, adult-imposed lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was still in school, 7 years ago, she was in a WONDERFUL <br/>\nschool. They had no testing, no grades, a LOT of freedom, and an exciting, <br/>\ninteresting, stimulating environment where all subjects in the curriculum <br/>\nwere integrated into what homeschoolers would call unit studies. She loved <br/>\nit. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT - I started to see the signs of a &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; taking place. And <br/>\neven though my child was absolutely happy there, I wanted her out before more <br/>\nharm was done.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is what needs to be said more openly. Unschoolers see potential <br/>\nharm coming from imposed schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are challenging people to think something that can be pretty darn <br/>\nuncomfortable or VERY scary. Or even dangerous. I can understand why people <br/>\noften don&#39;t like hearing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome years ago, Sandra gave a talk and said something like, &quot;Be brave - think <br/>\ndangerous thoughts. If you&#39;re too scared, duct-tape yourself to a chair and <br/>\nget someone to watch you. &lt;g&gt; When you&#39;re done thinking dangerous thoughts, <br/>\nyou&#39;ll still be there and you can just go right back to whatever you were <br/>\ndoing before - nothing has to change.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dangerous thoughts I needed to be brave enough to ponder were: how <br/>\nschooling had harmed ME and how I was potentially harming my own kids by <br/>\nimposing any kind of schooling on them. It profoundly affected me to simply <br/>\nhear the suggestion that it is SAFE to carry out such &quot;what if&quot; scenarios in <br/>\nmy head. It was a challenge and I couldn&#39;t stop myself from doing it, if I&#39;d <br/>\nwanted to &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat IF my kids can learn all the basic literacy stuff, that will make them <br/>\nable to fully self-educate, in 50 hours total (which is what John Taylor <br/>\nGatto claims)? What if what an imposed curriculum teaches is mostly <br/>\ndependency? What if, by requiring my kids to just &quot;do math,&quot; I&#39;m teaching <br/>\nthem that they can&#39;t really trust themelves, that they should rely on someone <br/>\nelse to tell them what they should learn? What if what they are learning is, <br/>\nas John Gatto says, &quot;...the most important lesson of all, that we must wait <br/>\nfor other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our <br/>\nlives.&quot; What if I&#39;m teaching them that their worth depends on someone else&#39;s <br/>\nevaluation of how well they&#39;ve learned what someone else decided they should <br/>\nlearn? What if I&#39;m undermining their self-trust?
