My in-laws just told me about this.  They live just a few miles from there and asked me if I had heard about it.  This is the kind of town where &quot;regular&quot; hard working families live - probably like where most of us live.  It&#39;s just sad.  I am so glad I have the priviledge of staying home with my kids and protecting them from a lot of this.
