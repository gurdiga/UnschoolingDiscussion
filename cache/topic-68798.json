In this case, it is not the parent that has to <br/>\ndecide that they kids can&#39;t play together though, which is not a natural <br/>\nconsequence.  Also, with young children, addressing the situation with them <br/>\nboth (if possible) and finding peaceful solutions together will most likely <br/>\nprevent continued hard feelings and allow them to continue playing.  I would <br/>\nalways try to focus on solutions that bring back peace immediately, not <br/>\nthose that leave  the child left alone in guilt and unhappiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.

When something like <br/>\nthis has happened in our home, I have also walked away from the situation and <br/>\nsaid that I&#39;d rather not &quot;play&quot; with that person for now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone says mean, hateful things to me, then I may say I would rather not <br/>\nbe around that person at the moment.  I have also stated that I would not <br/>\ntalk to that person in the same manner, and that it hurts me to be spoken to <br/>\nthat way, and that I&#39;d rather not be hurt anymore so I am &quot;removing&quot; myself <br/>\nfrom the conversation and I don&#39;t want to  talk for the time being.  If the <br/>\nchild continues to spout off at me, I ignore.  When there is a change in <br/>\ntone, or an apology, or I can see a real change in heart, I don&#39;t dwell on <br/>\nthe unkind things, we just continue the conversation without the attacks.  <br/>\nMaybe I believe this way a little more because we deal with foster children <br/>\nwho have been raised very differently and on some things, I have to set a <br/>\nclear standard or our home would be chaos.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one deserves to be spoken to hatefully.  If you were walking down the <br/>\nstreet and observed an elderly person, or someone of a minority race, or <br/>\nanyone for that matter, being spat on, being slurred, or attacked <br/>\nverbally/physically, would you do nothing?  No one deserves to be treated in <br/>\nthis way, especially other people in the family and/or ourselves.  When <br/>\nsomeone is stuck unable to function because one child decides they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto go, or they cannot control their anger, it affects the entire family, <br/>\nespecially the other children.  I think the 2 choice principle would work <br/>\nwell here...we are going to the bank...would you like to bring a book or your <br/>\ngame so you don&#39;t get bored?  We&#39;re going to the play park to visit with <br/>\nother families,...would you like to bring your skates/bike/games to share <br/>\nwith the other kids, or would you rather read in the car?  <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68808,"nextTopicId":68812}}
