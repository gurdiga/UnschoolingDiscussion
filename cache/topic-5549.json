It has lungs","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-856470934\">The African Lungfish lives in the swamps and rivers of West and South Africa<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oregonzoo.com/cards/Rainforest/lungfish.african.htm)\">http://www.oregonzoo.com/cards/Rainforest/lungfish.african.htm)</a>.  It has<br/>\nlungs which allow it to breath and stay alive during the dry season in soft<br/>\nmud within a mucus-lined cocoon.  It can survive in such a state for up to<br/>\nfour years.  When the waters return, it leaves the cocoon and pretty much<br/>\nswims around like your average fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe African Lungfish is well adapted to the seasonality of it&#39;s physical<br/>\nenvironment.  It instinctively knows when it&#39;s time to carry on as usual and<br/>\nsimilarly, when to slow down and burrow in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if I&#39;m as in touch with my own instincts as the African Lungfish<br/>\nis.  Humans live in physical/emotional/business environments which have<br/>\ncycles and seasons as well.  There is a time to build, to plant seeds, to<br/>\nprepare, and there is also a time to retrench, to rest, and to burrow in.<br/>\nSometimes, in our 24-hour, instant gratification, hyper-materialistic<br/>\nsociety,  it can be too easy to forget these principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank goodness for the animals to help us remember!<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn O.
