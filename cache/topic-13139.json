I STILL had my agenda to &quot;get her<br/>\nreading.  I moved from overt attempts (before I was truly comfortable with<br/>\nunschooling),  to covert attempts.....thinking it would help her.  I finally<br/>\n*really* got it....that I was still subtly trying to steer her toward<br/>\nreading....I don&#39;t think I was totally consciuos of all that I was<br/>\ndoing.....and she reacted consiusly at times unconsciously at other<br/>\ntimes....but always resisting.<br/>\n    I finally took the focus off of her completely.  I began examining *my*<br/>\nthought,  feelings,  and actions.  And *finally* was able to get out of her<br/>\nway.  It&#39;s been about 6 months since I&#39;ve let go of MY issues,  agenda,  and<br/>\ndesires about it.<br/>\n    She has recently become comfortable enough to come ask me things about<br/>\nwords now.  And I&#39;m capable of simply giving her the information.  I have<br/>\nworked through my feelings about it and she is healing from all my attempts<br/>\nto turn it into a lesson,  or to please, dissappoint,  or try to control me.<br/>\nShe is making her way along,  though hasn&#39;t had a major breakthrough yet.<br/>\nSomehow,  I&#39;m sure she has a better chance now...as she learns she can trust<br/>\nme to facilitate,  not push or *teach*.<br/>\n    It also helped me to read Holt&#39;s Learning all the Time.  He addresses<br/>\nreading....and talks about &#39;immersing youngsters in written language&#39;  from<br/>\nthe grownup world,  not that dull kid stuff.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m trying to be creative in how to do this ....like putting &#39;menus&#39; on<br/>\nthe fridge,  hanging a calendar with activities spelled out clearly and<br/>\nlegibly,  copying words to songs family members like,  and changing<br/>\n&#39;inspirational&#39; quotes I post on the fridge.   Though I&#39;m sure the *key* to<br/>\nit all is my having moved past &quot;my problems&quot; about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helped me to read Holt&#39;s description abput learning math....where dd<br/>\nand I have had the &#39;opposite&#39;  experience.  I had a natural inclination to<br/>\nsimply be interested in her mathematical,  logical processing....and so have<br/>\nbeen a much more capable facilitator......of course,  her confidence in this<br/>\narea soars!<br/>\n<br/>\nShew1  This turned out long!  Look out....maybe I&#39;m back!  :-)<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Pat wrote:<br/>\n&gt;How could you use trickery in regards to reading?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anytime your agenda, hidden or otherwise, superceeds the child&#39;s agenda<br/>\nto just learn at their own pace, then you are out of the unschooling<br/>\nrealm. This may be an option for a parent, but they will get questioned<br/>\non those choices when in an unschooling forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the agenda is hidden, its trickery. And they will catch on. And<br/>\nthere will be resentment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I recommended a bringing some comic books and magazines but after reading<br/>\n&gt;a few of the replies, I realize it is not the unschooling way to take the<br/>\n&gt;lead with regard to a resistant reader.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, there are no resistant readers in the unschooling realm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;That being said, why can&#39;t we<br/>\n&gt;look at it the same way we would look a feeding a child not thriving.  If<br/>\n&gt;I was concerned about my child&#39;s health because he wasn&#39;t interested in<br/>\n&gt;eating due to a health problem (here I am comparing the damage from ps to<br/>\n&gt;a health problem), wouldn&#39;t I offer a good variety of food to help him?<br/>\n&gt;Wouldn&#39;t it be ok in this situation to bring home some fun things to read<br/>\n&gt;and let him know what you have?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, its the parent putting their agenda over a child&#39;s natural desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving stuff around the house is a far cry from going to a bookstore and<br/>\nspending 3 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids learn to read because the written word is all around us. And they<br/>\nwill learn best at their own time, if given the space and trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nkolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MorelFam@aol.com","from":"MorelFam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"391fNt8HEXpnCPbPGBRJYZxfACVyfWRqtVS6P3tmrD02df_CFJ0PmMQyJUK4PbEOOe9NSi8aBQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"reading ideas","postDate":"968905639","msgId":13139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGExLmE5OTQ1YTIuMjZmMWFkYTdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31754,"prevInTime":13138,"nextInTime":13140,"topicId":13139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/13/00 6:08:54 AM, Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1404641783\">In a message dated 9/13/00 6:08:54 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; would it help any if she read into a <br/>\ntape recorder?  ...
