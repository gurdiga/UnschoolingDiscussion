But all that high order thinking keeps getting<br/>\nin my way of reading about it ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the varieties (Mahayana, Therevada, Buddhist) and subvarieties (Zen)<br/>\nmake it a daunting task. There are Western Buddhists (which some consider<br/>\nlegitimately another branch of Buddhism and some don&#39;t) who have stripped<br/>\naway the mystical stuff and gotten to the heart of things, from a western<br/>\npoint of view anyway. Like Sylvia Boorstein (I found the one book of hers<br/>\nthat I read very down to earth and practical) and Jon Kabat-Zinn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had good luck with the About.com sites. If you&#39;ve never been there,<br/>\nthey have hundreds of subject areas, with one person being an expert on one<br/>\nsubject area. They are usually people with a passion for the subjects so<br/>\nthey do a great job combing the web for great sites. (They have pages on<br/>\nPlastics, Sandra ;-) As well as Boston, Webdesign, Physics, Basenjis,<br/>\nGardening, Video games, Japanese ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more than one for Buddhism but the one I checked had a Beginners<br/>\nGuide: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://buddhism.about.com/\">http://buddhism.about.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI had a website of books on religions for kids and adults at one time. It<br/>\nwas fun collecting, but maintaining was more than I had time for. :-/ The<br/>\ndesign isn&#39;t anything to brag about, but the information is pretty well<br/>\norganized. I think the China one links back to my defunct AOL account and a<br/>\nfew sites I suspect are dead by now. But the list of books should still be<br/>\nuseful. (They link to Amazon. I scoured Amazon for what appeared to be<br/>\nhighly recommended *and* easy to read.) I *think* I did a credible job of<br/>\nsummarizing Buddhism and the varieties on the main Buddhism page.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/JFetteroll/worldreligions.html\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/JFetteroll/worldreligions.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(It seems to be case sensitive for some reason.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I love the Dummies and Complete Idiot&#39;s books. Frankly I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nwell the stuff sticks. But I love the concept and I keep reading them.<br/>\n(Though some are much better than others.) Perhaps I was lucky at never<br/>\nhaving to take seriously anyone&#39;s thoughts that I was dumb so I see the Dumb<br/>\ntitles as a way of saying that they understand that I&#39;m looking for a book<br/>\nthat won&#39;t assume I know anything about the subject. I&#39;ve never had a book<br/>\nmake me feel dumb.
