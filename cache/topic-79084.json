I assumed people would fear arrest/prosecutuion rather than wave guns about.<br/>\n<br/>\nVia la Canada! I guess - I&#39;ll be renting &quot;Columbine&quot; this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS. As a teen, I loved my old Toyota stick shifter as the handle came off and I could threateningly wave it at other teenage drivers.  Power! I was a sick puppy!  :O))  Too much sitting in desks with Craig behind me drilling his pen into my spine!<br/>\n<br/>\nTim T<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReminds me of the time I followed a driver. I had stopped in front of my <br/>\nhouse to see if the power had come on during the ice storm here in Maine. The car <br/>\nof teenagers came up behind me and laid on its horn and yelled something at <br/>\nme. I drove down the road behind them to ask what the problem was and the kid <br/>\nstopped his car got out and opened the trunk. I didn&#39;t stay to find out what he <br/>\npulled out. <br/>\nAnother time some kids went by our home at like 90 mph, I called the police <br/>\nand I went to find them. A local officer flagged me down and said not a good <br/>\nidea. That if I went to their door they could shoot me for trespassing. Ugh, <br/>\nnice.. Good ol&#39; Maine. This was the same kids that drove by me retrieving my <br/>\nloose dog and their mirror brushed my shirt as they flew by. The speed on our <br/>\nstreet is 35 but not many follow it. Laura <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Oh sheesh!! <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to have told a story too much like an ugly truth. <br/>\n<br/>\nVery sorry about your brother. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had thoughts of potential death when I confronted my behind-me neighbor <br/>\nabout being mean to his kids but at that moment it was worth the risk. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79040,"nextTopicId":79081}}
