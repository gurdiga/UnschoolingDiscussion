Sunday night he\r<br/>\nfelt hot in the bed with us, he was restless, got up alot with &quot;snot choking\r<br/>\nhim&quot; and generally felt worse throughout the night. Monday morning, he slept\r<br/>\nVERY late ( after getting up very early and taking some medicine) He felt\r<br/>\nwarm on and off all day, but nothing extreme. He laid in the bed pretty much\r<br/>\nall day, no appetite or energy. But, by evening, he was feeling a little\r<br/>\nbetter. He ate supper and stayed up til his normal bed time. He slept well\r<br/>\nlast night. He still has cold/allergy symptoms today, but in general, he has\r<br/>\nfelt much better.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAlso yesterday, he came to me and said that &quot;his balls were red and hot&quot; I\r<br/>\nasked him if they hurt, or if it hurt when he peed, she said, &quot;no, I think\r<br/>\nthey are just too hot from my fever&quot; Then again today, he asked me &quot;what\r<br/>\ndo balls look like?&quot; I said, &quot;what?, what do you mean, do you think yours\r<br/>\nlook &quot;funny&quot;, do they look different than normal?&quot; He again said &quot;no&quot;.. He\r<br/>\nsaid he meant on the inside.. and I told him we would look it up on the\r<br/>\ninternet to see a picture of inside your testicles.. OK. .then later again\r<br/>\nthis evening, he came to me and said his ball were hot. So, this time, I\r<br/>\nsaid.. well, let me look at them. I took a look and his whole groin area is\r<br/>\nred and irritatied looking.. Like.. around his pubic area ( where a man\r<br/>\nnormally has hair), all down his scrotum, its red, similar to a diaper rash.\r<br/>\n  The area is hot, like a heat rash. His scrotum looked a little swollen,\r<br/>\nbut, not a lot.. its really hard for me to tell if its swollen. He said\r<br/>\nit hurt when he walks, from what he described, not an &quot;inside pain&quot; but an\r<br/>\nouter irriation. I had him put on some loose boxers and he is just taking it\r<br/>\neasy right now.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n  My husband was VERY concerned. I am more puzzled than anything. I have\r<br/>\nnever seen anything like this on a boy his age. He does not wet his pants,\r<br/>\nand he has not been hot and sweaty from playing or anything.. No tight\r<br/>\nunderwear or pants.
