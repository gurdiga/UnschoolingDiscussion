A lot of the bus drivers around here<br/>\nare nasty...and I can actually see a few of them doing it. I&#39;ve even heard<br/>\nit threatened. I went to public school and have heard things like that<br/>\nbefore...and when I was in Kindergarten, the bus driver missed my stop...but<br/>\na few houses up (we lived in a pretty &quot;rural&quot; area and that was VERY far),<br/>\none of the parents said they knew me and my parents...so the bus driver put<br/>\nme off there! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...things are just too crazy. We have considered sending the children<br/>\nto high school...but I&#39;m not so sure any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n~`*S*`~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*~* Want a beautiful, inexpensive heirloom your family will treasure for<br/>\ngenerations to come? <br/>\nAsk me for details!<br/>\n--Be your own Detective!
