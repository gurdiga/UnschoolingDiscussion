He also seems to ...be more<br/>\n&quot;spirited&quot;... when he gets embarrassed about<br/>\nsomething...like if someone notices, for example, how<br/>\n&quot;much energy he has!!!&quot; or if someone gets annoyed<br/>\nwith him for literally bouncing off the walls, he just<br/>\ndoes it even moreso. Not to spite, but out of<br/>\nembarrassment and he &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; (my words) and<br/>\njust acts bonkers. He gets an insomniatic (my very own<br/>\nword) hair from me, and I give him &quot;sleepytime&quot; tea<br/>\n(Celestial Seasonings makes it) with lots of honey,<br/>\nand now he loves it and actually asks for it,<br/>\nespecially when he&#39;s sick. Also I got one time at the<br/>\nhealth food store here a &quot;bar&quot; (like a candy bar..or<br/>\nto him anyway) that is called &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; or<br/>\nsomething like that, and there were little<br/>\n&quot;Pedi-Active&quot; chewable pills too, that we tried. They<br/>\nseemed to help somewhat, but not as much as the bar.<br/>\nWho knows why. Maybe the bar had more EFA&#39;s in it.<br/>\nAlso my most favorite thing in the whole world (aside<br/>\nfrom Rescue Remedy, of course, which we share) is<br/>\ncalled &quot;Humphrey&#39;s 3&quot;...and they are &quot;teething/colic&quot;<br/>\nhomeopathic tablets and I gave them to ds when he<br/>\nfirst started teething and to dd when she was a very<br/>\ngas-filled cranky baby and now when they have tummy<br/>\naches or are getting restless (oh, it&#39;s also for<br/>\n&quot;wakefulness&quot;), and sometimes 30 minutes before bed.<br/>\nds takes 5 now (he&#39;s a very skinny almost 6yo), and dd<br/>\nstill takes 3, she doesn&#39;t need more. I have taken<br/>\nthem sometimes, for a stomach ache and I took 7...(I<br/>\nweighed about 115 at the time, to give you some idea<br/>\nof dosage for you dd) and they worked immediately.<br/>\nThe ingredients are:<br/>\nchamomila coffee belladonna and sugar. <br/>\nthey dissolve on the tongue and taste ...like sugar.<br/>\nI get them at wal-mart or any pharmacy open...you have<br/>\nto ask for them at the counter. It&#39;s about 3-5 dollars<br/>\nfor a bottle of 135 pellets.<br/>\nHope that helps a little.<br/>\n-Bobbie <br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RValvo7626@...\">RValvo7626@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 3/30/01 7:25:36 PM Mountain<br/>\n&gt; Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;  Dh and I did try an herbal supplement for<br/>\n&gt; &quot;active&quot; children to help his <br/>\n&gt; neurotransmitters connect so stepson could think<br/>\n&gt; better and control himself. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     May I ask what this herbal supplement was?
