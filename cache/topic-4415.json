The day will come that they will be living with us and they <br/>\nsay they want to be unschooled too.  The problem is they have NO <br/>\nsocial skills (their current living situation has them ashamed to <br/>\nhave friends over and the friends they do have they fight with <br/>\nsometimes because of their situation and basically has them <br/>\nsocial hermits).  They also say that they don&#39;t like school because <br/>\nit is boring and they are always WAY ahead of the other students.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took them a minute to realize that they are schooled over here <br/>\nevery waking minute.  They are here every other week (about) and <br/>\nwe glean lessons from everything.  We have gotten moral lessons <br/>\nfrom every movie we have seen (from Queen to the Aliens movies).  <br/>\nBecause of their mothers racism and religious intolerance, they <br/>\nkeep many of their lessons under a bushel (they refused to say <br/>\nwhat they did the weekends we watched X and the weekend we <br/>\nwatched Roots).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to know is do they need a good enough reason to be <br/>\nhomeschooled by me?  Their mother would like nothing more than <br/>\nto see them have trouble getting to college because they were <br/>\nhomeschooled.  I was thinking I would homeschool them until HS <br/>\nage and then send them to the local HS.  Then when they are here <br/>\nthey won&#39;t have the problem inviting friends over for snacks, dinner, <br/>\novernight, etc that they do living with their mom (except here they <br/>\nhave the annoying brother and sister -- they just don&#39;t think of Terry <br/>\nand Lapis as annoying -- yet &lt;VEG&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do.
