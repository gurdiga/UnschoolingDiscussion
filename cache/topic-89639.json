I guess my comment <br/>\nkind of encompasses this list and the always learning list since I have been <br/>\nreading both for the last few weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I would like to say that I personally think that Sandra shows great <br/>\nrestraint and compassion in her posts, this is not a yippee, jump on the Sandra <br/>\nguru wagon endorsement, I am not that kind of person. I think the posts I have <br/>\nread so far have been very considerate of peoples feelings. Sometimes though <br/>\npeople might think that anyone who disagrees with them is being mean, that is <br/>\nnot the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think taking the time to read over time is a good idea especially with <br/>\nthreads that might shake the foundations of our beliefs. That is not to say we <br/>\nhave to change what we believe, we don&#39;t, we don&#39;t even have to respond to the <br/>\nposts, in fact no one has to know we even read them, LOL. But, one might find in <br/>\nreading and thinking that even their own beliefs become clearer for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is one thing to believe in something, anything be it a religion or a way <br/>\nof learning or a way of eating but to truly own it I think it helps to know why <br/>\nwe believe it. Over the years it has been the challenging discussions that I <br/>\nhave been in here on the yahoo lists that have helped me to see more clearly <br/>\njust exactly who I am. I won&#39;t even pretend it was easy, in fact it often took <br/>\na lot of guts to stay in the discussion. I think those of us who were/are <br/>\nwilling to keep the talking going help a great many others to clarify what they <br/>\nbelieve also. Not everyone has the constitution to handle conflict, it can be <br/>\nscary. Lots of people read and never post but they stay so something is <br/>\nhappening.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes I just sit and read and then I think and read some more.

Thanks for several factors, I have that freedom, and I guard it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the freedom to learn more in the way I want to learn it.  Not everyone <br/>\ncan provide that to me, but I have been thankful to find it over the years <br/>\nfrom La Leche League leaders, other moms, friends who&#39;ve had children before or <br/>\nalong with me, and generous strangers (some of whom because friends) who <br/>\nhelped me by writing articles in GWS and HEM and online, helping me clarify and <br/>\npurify what I was doing and thinking with Kirby, when he was little, when we <br/>\nthought Kirby would need to be homeschooled, but Marty would probably like school <br/>\nand want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the freedom to share what I have learned with other unschoolers.  <br/>\nThanks to e-mail and the internet, I have that freedom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want the freedom to ask  people to keep their voices down in my house when <br/>\nmy kids are sleeping late because they stayed up reading and playing and <br/>\nwriting to their friends.  Due to my own insistence, I have that freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like that I have the freedom not to invite people into my home if I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want them there.  I like that when someone is in my home and starts <br/>\nbeing difficult or offensive I can ask him to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the freedom yahoogroups offers for just anybody to start an e-mail <br/>\nlist there.  I have a few, and am on several more.  I&#39;ve been on some that were <br/>\ntemporary, and some that died out, and some that have lasted years and years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the freedom of assembly which I&#39;ve exercised many stated and <br/>\nadvertised in advance.  I like it when people are peaceable and cooperative in those <br/>\nmeetings.   I would NOT like it if someone followed me out after I left such a <br/>\nmeeting and accosted me in an alley.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what it feels like when someone writes me a hateful kind of attack on <br/>\nthe side because I&#39;ve expressed my honest feelings on a list which has a <br/>\nstated and advertised purpose. On a list on which over half a dozen people <br/>\ncooperatively designed a set of guidelines, I was singled out privately and insulted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI want the freedom to live my private e-mail life in peace.  Is that asking <br/>\nfor too much freedom?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, without a paragraph that might identify the person, is my response to <br/>\nmy attacker.  The quotes are the whole post, barring that identifying bit, and <br/>\nthe other paragraphs are my responses of earlier today:<br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know that you are some sort of unschooling icon, published books, <br/>\nfounded a website, etc. but I have to wonder by your postings if you have let your <br/>\nown &quot;expertness&quot; take over.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t published a book.  Anyone can have a website.<br/>\nI&#39;ve never tried to make anyone listen to me.  Some do and some don&#39;t.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve listened to others, too.  I learned about unschooling from a couple of <br/>\nLa Leche League leaders whose kids were not in school.  I learned a lot from <br/>\npeople online, then, when Kirby was five and six.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Yes, I just rejoined the group a few days ago,  but I had been a member <br/>\nwith a different email address some time ago.  I just wondered why you feel the <br/>\nneed to control what other adults say when your philosophy with your own and <br/>\nothers children seems to be one of unlimited ideas and freedom of expression?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like these kinds of discussions off the list.   I would much prefer <br/>\nto have them ON the list, because my purpose with my volunteer time is to help <br/>\nlots of other people understand that they don&#39;t have to teach their children <br/>\nfor them to learn, and they don&#39;t have to control their children for them to <br/>\n&quot;be good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It&#39;s possible to be just as narrowminded in the name of unschooling as in <br/>\nanything else.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFocussed.  I am focussed on unschooling.  If yo&#39;ure not, why is what I do any <br/>\nconcern of yours?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Apparently, you feel that &quot;warnings are put there to justify limiting and <br/>\ncontrolling children&quot;, and that&#39;s wrong, but for adults to express their own <br/>\nopinions they should &quot;read a while longer, maybe read in the archives, maybe <br/>\nread at www.unschooling.com  (the message boards there).  With such a large list, <br/>\nmoderators sometimes don&#39;t catch all the too-new posters&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Apparently?&quot; I&#39;m involved with several other people in keeping a VERY large <br/>\nlist functioning and useful.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to yahoogroups.com there are clear directions for creating a <br/>\nyahoogroup.  If you want to create your own and run it the way you&#39;re sure we should <br/>\nbe running this one, it would be no problem for you to list it and invite <br/>\npeople to join, not ony on this list but at www.unschooling.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we&#39;re not &quot;doing it right.&quot;  We&#39;re not keeping you from doing it <br/>\nbetter.  But we (Joyce, Pam Sorooshian and our half dozen moderators, all <br/>\nvolunteers) are doing what we think is the best use of our volunteer time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not everyone is happy, some are.   If what we&#39;re saying or the way we&#39;re <br/>\nsaying it isn&#39;t helping you or your family, that might be more about you and <br/>\nyour family than about what we&#39;re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;[deleted identifying info] I found www.unschooling.com right away, and have <br/>\nbeen on the path to unschooling most of that time [several years]. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been unschooling for twelve and a half years without getting off the <br/>\npath.  Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m entirely confident, and you call it &quot;smug.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll discuss some of the other questions on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n-------------end of quoted e-mail--------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a big world.  There are lots of e-mail lists and websites.  Take what <br/>\nyou need and leave the rest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89620,"nextTopicId":89730}}
