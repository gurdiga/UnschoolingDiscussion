Boneless Pork Loin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Preparation: <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Add the dry ingredients to the water and bring to a boil. Allow to completely cool, then put<br/>\n&gt; mixture in the icebox, until very cold - usually over night. Take the cure and load your pump<br/>\n&gt; and inject it to about 10% of the weight of the loin. I have tried just soaking the loin with<br/>\n&gt; the cure and it wasn&#39;t as good as it is when injected. Get a good metal meat pump, I have a<br/>\n&gt; old one that holds five ounces. A cup of cure weighs about roughly a half a pound if you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have a scale. If you have a five pound loin you will need to inject eight ounces (one<br/>\n&gt; cup) of mix. Place in a bag and pour remaining cure over the loin to cover, close the bag up<br/>\n&gt; and tie it. Try to remove as much air as you can from the bag. Place bag in pan and put in<br/>\n&gt; the bottom of fridge. You want to make sure that you keep the temperature between 35°<br/>\n&gt; and 40°. Do not allow to get above 40° or to freeze. You can allow to cure for as little as two<br/>\n&gt; days and as much as five. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I take them out after three days. Wash them and wash them again and just for drill, do it<br/>\n&gt; again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here ends the Canadian part. Now it is ready to freeze or slice and fry<br/>\nin a little oil as it is very lean. The honey and sugar part I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink are quite accurate from a Canadian view point. Our Canadian<br/>\npeameal bacon has no sweetness to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest is for smoking it , which sounds pretty tasty too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dry it off and place on smoker at 160° and light smoke for about 3 hours and them<br/>\n&gt; crank the temperature up to 225°. Pull it off the smoker when the temperature is 160°<br/>\n&gt; internal, or whatever you feel is safe. Allow to cool back down and then place in the fridge.<br/>\n&gt; It is now ready to eat, so enjoy it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you cut a loin in half or use two loins, you can pull one and cook it after two days of<br/>\n&gt; curing. This way you can know how salty it is after just two days, if you like it pull the other<br/>\n&gt; one out and smoke it. Apple and hickory is what I prefer for the smoking wood. Another<br/>\n&gt; twist to this recipe is to drop the coriander and substitute the honey with Dr Pepper syrup.<br/>\n&gt; Before you try the DP in this recipe, spray or baste some ribs when you cook them with Dr<br/>\n&gt; Pepper. That way you will have an idea what taste you&#39;ll get. We like it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;                                                            Submitted by Ashley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   <br/>\n The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when <br/>\n Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been <br/>\n Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n Samantha                  B.F.
