I tell them that I don&#39;t homeschool because I think the schools are bad, but because I find the benefits of homeschooling are working well for my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is true, because when I began to homeschool I didn&#39;t think school was such a bad thing and I did start for the reasons stated above.  Now that I&#39;ve done more research, I do think that school is very bad for many children in many ways, but there isn&#39;t much point in going into that with people who are invested in the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----&gt; I of course told her I was<br/>\n  &gt; going to home school and she responded in a loud voice saying - &quot;what, our<br/>\n  &gt; elementary school isn&#39;t good enough for you?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"local elementary school","postDate":"1058552476","msgId":76704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExZC4yNDYyOTMwZS4yYzQ5OTQ5Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76706,"prevInTime":76703,"nextInTime":76705,"topicId":76704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/18/2003 2:11:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
