I&#39;m mostly a lurker here.. and seldom post,<br/>\nbut you are definatly in the right place to learn and gain confidence in<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your concerns about teens and college.. Our Emily is now 18..<br/>\npresently works as a waitress..and at a clothing store. She also spent a<br/>\nSummer working at a local State Park,, doing trail maintence, lots of<br/>\nmowing, and office/computer work. She continues to research and try out her<br/>\nideas for alternative house building (she was in the yard with bare feet<br/>\nmixing up a clay, straw, sand mixture a few weeks ago..learning to make<br/>\n&#39;cob&#39;.. at least I think that&#39;s what she called it. She is building a small<br/>\nshelter at the end of our yard..the younger sister thinks it will be a cool<br/>\nplay house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think we ever experienced any sort of transition..we never pay much<br/>\nattention to what grades the girls would be in anyway..life just flows. I<br/>\nalso have a daughter who&#39;s 12, so can definatly relate to what you are<br/>\nsaying, about friends and social activities becoming so much more important<br/>\nto them now.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily has thought about going to college, even spent time on campus<br/>\nshadowing one of her friends, another unschooled girl. She stayed in the<br/>\ndorm and attended a few classes with her too..but right now, Emily doesn&#39;t<br/>\nthink college would be of much benefit to her. She continues to learn quite<br/>\nwell on her own..and thinks it&#39;s foolish to spend so much money when what<br/>\nshe wants to know is already out there, free for the taking at the local<br/>\nlibrairies and talking with those who are already doing what she is<br/>\ninterested in. She came home so excited last week..a friend of a friend got<br/>\nwind of her interest in alternative building and back to the land stuff and<br/>\ngave her his entire collection of old Mother Earth News! Number 1thru about<br/>\n80 I think. (I&#39;ve been happily reading those myself!)

I&#39;ve written in the past for HEM and have <br/>\nbeen an unschooler for the last several years. (I also draw from <br/>\nCharlotte Mason&#39;s philosophy for our home education).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have five kids ranging in age from 15 down to 6--all of whom <br/>\nhave never been to institutional schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have loved the odyssey of home education from the chances to <br/>\nshare beloved literature together, to hosting what we call &quot;school <br/>\nparties&quot; (focusing on a topic and creating an event to share with <br/>\nfriends be it the California Gold Rush or a Journey to India). So <br/>\nfar my kids have exhibited all the fruits of what I expected from <br/>\nunschooling: a passion for learning, the ability to tackle a topic of <br/>\ninterest and milk it for all its worth and a voraicous appetite for <br/>\nbooks and the arts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, until now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly I have teens. My oldest is a sophomore. I feel the <br/>\nboom, boom of the college drumbeat right behind me most <br/>\ndays. (Husband teaches college English. We&#39;re highly aware of <br/>\ncollege admissions and wht it takes to go to college.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year for the first time, we enrolled our son in Algebra II at the <br/>\nlocal high school (since I am not equipped to teach it and the <br/>\nschool offers it for free--and are very friendly to homeschoolers). <br/>\nThis has been an eye-opener. My very bright son suddenly <br/>\nflunked two tests. While he is getting 95%+ on homework, we <br/>\ndiscovered he had no test taking skills. His mistakes were not in <br/>\nthe Algebra, but in the calculation errors (little stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve worked hard at developing this skill and he&#39;s now gotten <br/>\nboth a A- and a B+ in his most recent efforts. But this experience <br/>\nhas me a bit spooked. I suddenly find myself wondering if he <br/>\nneeds to experience ordinary school life in order to be prepared <br/>\nfor the more ordinary approach to academics that will be college. <br/>\nHow do we as unschoolers prepare them for &quot;schoolish&quot; <br/>\nbehavior? Or do we?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond set of questions has to do with 13 daughter. She <br/>\nsuddenly lost her passion for outside interests and is now <br/>\nconsumed with her social life.
