We&#39;ll still never be close, but we do send a digital<br/>\nphoto of the kids to them every so often (every couple of months).  No<br/>\nneed for me to get into my situation, just to say that I learned that<br/>\nmaybe people could walk all over me prior to having children, but once<br/>\nmy first baby was born I wasn&#39;t going to let ANYONE do anything in front<br/>\nof her that was horrible and I was not going to let anyone make me do<br/>\nthings that I didn&#39;t want my daughter to see me do.  Then was the time<br/>\nfor me to prove who I was and stand up for the things that I believed<br/>\nin.  If not then, then when would it ever matter?  I didn&#39;t want to be a<br/>\nhypocrite in my beliefs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs hard as that was to endure, I have gained the strength to know that I<br/>\ncan and would stand up to anyone when it comes to matters that I believe<br/>\nstrongly in.  I could walk away from any relationship if it were a toxic<br/>\none to me.  I will fight hard to make my relationships with my children<br/>\nnever be toxic, but that requires an honesty and closeness that is like<br/>\nvery few relationships that I will ever have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple questions:<br/>\nDoes your husband always go out of town to the same location?

I live in a rather<br/>\nlarge city, so we have several stores that will deliver groceries for<br/>\nfree if over a certain dollar amount ($250) or for a reasonable charge<br/>\nfor less.  There are also several personal shoppers that I&#39;ve seen<br/>\nadvertised and their rates aren&#39;t ridiculous once you figure just how<br/>\nlong it takes to shop with children and the cost of driving, etc.  There<br/>\nare also a couple of online grocery stores that I&#39;ve seen before (not<br/>\noffered here yet) that might cover your area.

I&#39;d eat<br/>\npopcorn every day for a week, rather than have a person drive my family to<br/>\nthe grocery store who was going to hit my child! Lock your door and don&#39;t<br/>\nlet her &quot;drop in unannounced&quot;. How to deal with her &quot;tactfully&quot; in front of<br/>\nyour children? I&#39;d personally say &quot;it is not okay for anyone to hit my<br/>\nchildren&quot;. I think it&#39;s more important for my kids to know that I will not<br/>\nlet someone abuse them than for some adult woman to not have hurt feelings.<br/>\nI&#39;m very unclear why you would invite a woman like that to your birthing,<br/>\nespecially a second time after she acted like that the first time. I&#39;m<br/>\nunclear why you continue to have her be a part of your daily existence. I&#39;m<br/>\nunclear why if she insists that the kids pray, you don&#39;t just say &quot;My<br/>\nchildren don&#39;t need to pray if they don&#39;t want to.&quot; and if she &quot;loses it on<br/>\nyou&quot; as you&#39;ve said the she does, go out of her house and don&#39;t go back!<br/>\nLife is too short to choose to be in the presence of people like that. Life<br/>\nis *way* too short to insist that children be in her presence.<br/>\nI would do whatever it takes to get your van fixed and not be dependant on<br/>\nthis woman. If that is not possible, do all your shopping when your husband<br/>\nis there and stay at home or find alternate transportation when he&#39;s not. It<br/>\nis within your power to choose to be around her abuse, verbal and otherwise,<br/>\nor not.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"dealing with family","postDate":"1050291402","msgId":64793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjI3UzZ4YzEwb2N1VlcwMDA0NDk1NUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64833,"prevInTime":64792,"nextInTime":64794,"topicId":64793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Four years ago, (or so) we were a very mainstream family.

I don&#39;t remember <br/>\nwhen it started, but I heard about homeschooling and fell in love with the <br/>\nidea.  I began reading and by the end of the year, I decided to pull my <br/>\ndaughter out of school and bring her home.  During those days of reading, I <br/>\nbecame aquainted with gentle parenting, decided to have unassisted births, <br/>\nuse cloth diapers and threw out the bottles for extended breastfeeding.  The <br/>\nprocess has been quite gradual, for me, but for my family (and my husband <br/>\nsometimes, lol) I&#39;ve turned into this radical hippie overnight.  I should <br/>\nalso add that during this process of reading and learning, I slowly drifted <br/>\nfrom the belief system in which I was raised (Episcopalian) and began <br/>\nexploring other faiths to the point that I now am left with basically no <br/>\nreligious beliefs whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children attended church off and on while they were very young, but 10 <br/>\nyears ago, I lost my daughter to stillbirth and I suppose that&#39;s when my <br/>\nreligious beliefs came under intense fire from within.  For some reason, now <br/>\nwhen my children visit my grandparents house, my grandmother INSISTS on them <br/>\nsaying a prayer at mealtime.  They actually are not allowed to eat unless <br/>\nthey participate (heads bowed, hands folded).  I have explained to my <br/>\ngrandmother that they don&#39;t need to pray if they don&#39;t want to because we <br/>\ndon&#39;t pray at home, but I hesitate to go further because she has gotten <br/>\nquite good at losing it on me, in front of my children, which I like to <br/>\navoid at all costs.  Today, in the car, my older son was irritating my <br/>\nyounger son and she actually turned around and slapped his hand!  Our van is <br/>\nbroken down and she was taking us to the grocery store, so I, once again, <br/>\nhesitated to say anything...not to mention I was completely shocked!  I have <br/>\nnever seen her raise a hand to a child in my life!  Anyone for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few days ago, she was over and read a couple of unschooling articles I had <br/>\nlying around and went off on me about how behind my children will become if <br/>\nI follow this nonsense, how they NEED to be in school, how terrible it is <br/>\nthat my almost 7 year old is just learning to read (she easily forgets this <br/>\nsame child has been  multiplying and dividing since the age of four.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my last two children were born, she raised hell, WHILE I was in LABOR!, <br/>\nthat I was going to kill my children by not having at least a midwife here <br/>\nwith us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting to the point where I feel like throwing in the towel and not <br/>\neven speaking to her.  I&#39;ve asked her to read books, websites, anything, but <br/>\nshe refuses.  She sees what happy, bright children I have and does not <br/>\nhesitate to comment on how wonderful they are, but bring up anything related <br/>\nto my choices in parenting and watch out!  Suddenly, those wonderful, <br/>\nbright, happy children are in dire straits.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you dealt with this in one form or another?  How can I tactfully <br/>\ndeal with her in front of my children?  Hell, away from my children?  If she <br/>\ndrops in unannounced during &quot;school days&quot; and sees them doing their own <br/>\nthing, she goes haywire.  My husband works out of town a LOT and until we <br/>\nget our van in working order, she is my only source of help for getting <br/>\nanywhere, not to mention just getting a break now and then.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long, but after tonight&#39;s prayer and hand slapping episode, <br/>\nmy blood is past boiling and I&#39;m at my wits end.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
