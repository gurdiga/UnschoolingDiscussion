He <br/>\ntold me the older boy came in to his room and ripped his blankets off and said <br/>\n&quot;lets go!&quot; I know he did say no several times and it was a big step for him. <br/>\n(thank you Sandra for reminding me of that)<br/>\n<br/>\nI then went to the tv room with my husband.

I asked <br/>\nif either one would be hit by their parents (I suspected the older one but <br/>\nafter some delay he finally answered a no and said I talk to my parents). The <br/>\nother boy and I spoke before went home. He began to cry. I wanted to cry with <br/>\nhim, I kinda did just less tears.<br/>\nI told him I was sorry this happened. I told him how important it is not to <br/>\ncave to pressure when you know its not kind. I told him soon this will pass but <br/>\nfor now 5 minutes of fun has now turned into prob a few months of no play (I <br/>\nknew his dad would ground him for months and he did). My husband and I spoke <br/>\nto the dad and he has had many issues with the older boy and the boy was <br/>\nactually banned from their home.

The two boys both <br/>\nattend school and one is two years older and has some family stresses. Im not <br/>\nfond of him bc he leaves a trail of trouble but I feel bad bc his parents have <br/>\nbeen fighting and his mom has a drinking problem (Got a DWI last week). I <br/>\ntook the boys to Walmart with me bc they wanted to go. I found when I got there <br/>\nthat they only wanted to go so they could take their skateboards which I have <br/>\nsafety concerns with (at Walmart) and my son knows this. He didn&#39;t speak up to <br/>\nthem and say no until they listened. I listened to them interact and its just <br/>\nsad. My son is soo different with this kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater in the night the boys came in about 10:30 from jumping on the <br/>\ntrampoline. We had some nice conversations about unschooling. We talked about me as a <br/>\nparent and how &quot;cool&quot; they think I am. Well, I had said to them &quot;you know im <br/>\nnot a strict parent all I ask is to know where my son is going and that he is <br/>\nmaking good choices.<br/>\nMy son popped his head in my room around 11ish and said &quot;were going to bed <br/>\nnow Mom.&quot; I KNEW something was up he never does that. I thought for a sec and <br/>\nthen said to my self no, Laura your going to trust his judgement..........&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell,.... Some time after 11:30 ish one of the boys (the one with the <br/>\ntroubled family) pretty much nagged my son and the other boy to go egging. At some <br/>\npoint walking down the street my son began to cry and ran home. He told the kid <br/>\nyou know I cant do this my mom will be so upset. More pressure from the boy <br/>\nand they ended up going. They egged two houses and one is a family that dislikes <br/>\nus bc we HS. Its my understanding that my son didn&#39;t throw one at this house <br/>\nbut rather the older boy did. We told him that just bc he didn&#39;t throw it he <br/>\nstill was there. The family knows we are not too impressed with them and they <br/>\nthe same. They have been looking for a reason to be irritated with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight the daughter of the family said to the older boy in IM that her <br/>\nparents think it was my son. My thoughts on this are why do they think it was my <br/>\nkid? He has never done anything the hurt anyone or break the law why my kid?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very upset inside that he caves into peer pressure. Im sad that he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t stand up to the boy. I didn&#39;t yell, I didn&#39;t punish but I did speak with <br/>\nhim. The last couple days he has been pretty close to my side and has apologized <br/>\na few times. Because the situation with the family and us isn&#39;t good and they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t throw the egg we all (three families) choose to say <br/>\nnothing. I feel guilt, I feel dishonest and I know they are going to find out.<br/>\nI have been not wanting to say he cannot play with this boy but in light of <br/>\nthis situation I dont think anything good is going to come from this <br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?
