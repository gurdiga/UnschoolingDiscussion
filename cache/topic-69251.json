SOS welcomes anyone with an interest <br/>\nin unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince its inception in April 2001, SOS has supported families that have made <br/>\nthe decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and challenges. <br/>\nThese families may wonder about socialization, the legal issues surrounding <br/>\nunschooling, accountability associations, or integration of John Holt&#39;s <br/>\neducational philosophy into their everyday lives. Some families may doubt <br/>\ntheir abilities, feel confused and ask themselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. <br/>\nSOS encourages parents to trust themselves and their children to make good <br/>\ndecisions and empowers them to find the support and information they need. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur Presenters<br/>\nFor our Keynote presenter we are very fortunate to have the popular <br/>\ncontributor to Unschooling.com message boards, its e-list, AlwaysLearning, <br/>\nand regular columnist in HEM---unschooling guru, Sandra Dodd.
