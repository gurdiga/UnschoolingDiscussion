Our main reason was that the bottom mattress was up too close to the top bunk that once the kids got bigger it didn&#39;t work so well.  So, Noelle wanted her mattress/boxspring on the floor.  So we did this, leaving the back railing and discarding the one in the front.  We didn&#39;t have any problems, but you&#39;re the best judge...if it seems wobbly don&#39;t do it....or maybe you can secure the frame to the studs in the wall to ensure safety?<br/>\n <br/>\nBrandie<br/>\n<br/>\nnellebelle &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nWe are thinking about converting this bunkbed (see photo here:) <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://melonary.blogspot.com/2005/05/bedrooms.html\">http://melonary.blogspot.com/2005/05/bedrooms.html</a><br/>\ninto a loft bed <br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Possibly<br/>\nto look at additionally fixing of the top bed to the wall (find the studs!)<br/>\nto help take some of the weight and minimize movement.
