His <br/>\nlast documentary, Bowling for Columbine, made for US$3m pulled in US$22m at the <br/>\nUS box office. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Moore&#39;s publicity stunt, if that is what is, appears to be working. <br/>\n<br/>\nA front-page news piece in The New York Times was followed yesterday by an <br/>\neditorial denouncing Disney for censorship and denial of Moore&#39;s right to free <br/>\nexpression. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoore told CNN that Disney had &quot;signed a contract to distribute this [film]&quot; <br/>\nbut got cold feet. But Disney executives insists there was never any contract. <br/>\nAnd a source close to Miramax said that the only deal there was for <br/>\nfinancing, not for distribution.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100379,"nextTopicId":100286}}
