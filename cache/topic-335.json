So, the government has created a new mandatory level of <br/>\neducation - the Baby Genius school.  We will teach your baby to sit up, <br/>\ncrawl, walk, and talk, and toilet-train your toddler.  The government <br/>\nhas created classes for the following age groups:  the sitting class, 6 <br/>\nmonths; the crawling class, seven months; the walking class, 11 months; <br/>\nthe talking class, 18 months.  Basic toilet training, 24 months; <br/>\nadvanced toilet training, 30 months.  Should your child fail to pass our <br/>\nmonthly examinations, he or she will be insulted and verbally abused <br/>\nuntil he or she finally gets it.  Late graduation from our school will <br/>\nresult in rejection from entering prestigious pre-schools where children <br/>\nwill be taught to color in the lines and conform to government set <br/>\nstandards in order to prepare them for kindergarten.  This new law will <br/>\ngo into effect August 29th.  All babies must attend.  Those parents <br/>\nwishing to homeschool their infants must complete all 40 pages of form <br/>\nS-537 to register by August 29th.  Text books will be provided upon <br/>\nrequest.  If approved, they will be visited monthly by an education <br/>\nauthority to make sure their child can pass the tests.  The parents then <br/>\nreserve the right to be ridiculed by their parents, friends, and <br/>\nneighbors for depriving their child of the right to an education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I made this up.  It&#39;s not true at all.  Sometimes this is how <br/>\nI feel our public school system is going.
