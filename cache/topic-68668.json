","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-271890541\">****Our social group is so small because of our choices for our children<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point in time, I feel exceptionally alienated from<br/>\nnon-homeschool<br/>\nmoms!!<br/>\nNancy****<br/>\n<br/>\n****I now find myself separating from friends who follow<br/>\nvery mainstream parenting practices.  These weren&#39;t overnight losses.<br/>\nMany<br/>\nof them took years to disolve but the change in lifestyles crept in and<br/>\nate<br/>\naway at the friendships<br/>\nJennifer****<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting that this should come up now.  My husband and I have been<br/>\ndiscussing this at length for a while now.  We&#39;ve recently lost a bunch<br/>\nof friends (ok, we know where some of them are, it&#39;s just when we go<br/>\nthere there&#39;s some one else living there - they&#39;ve moved).  Two families<br/>\nhave moved far away, one family has dissolved in a sea of drugs and<br/>\nfighting, one has left us because of our family/schooling choices (she<br/>\nwas a friend from high school, I&#39;d known her for over 25 years), and our<br/>\nhomeschooling group is disintegrating due to lack of interest and who<br/>\nknows what else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe long term friendship has been the hardest for me, I thought it would<br/>\nalways be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homeschooling group is also hard.  Most aren&#39;t interested in getting<br/>\ntogether anymore, every time a new family shows up they are turned off<br/>\nby the group and it&#39;s cliqueishness (is that a word?) and they leave<br/>\nus.  It&#39;s the only group in town, except for the Christian group and<br/>\nthey make you sign a statement of faith form before joining, so that&#39;s<br/>\nout for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are, losing our friends, lost our homeschooling group (I&#39;m<br/>\ntired of fighting for it, I feel like I&#39;m the only one), and struggling<br/>\nto find new friends.  We lost our non homeschool friends a long time<br/>\nago, when their children started school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I feel I am doing my kids a disservice by not sending them to<br/>\nschool, but then I slap myself on the head and our life goes on<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a little disjointed, sorry for that.  I just wanted to say that<br/>\nit&#39;s happening here too.  And I&#39;m hoping that this summer brings new<br/>\nfriends for my kids to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nin CA where our school is called Windystreet School, just like our email<br/>\naddress.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68377,"nextTopicId":68622}}
