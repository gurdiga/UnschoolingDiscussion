The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1225050455\">I also have FMS...or at least that&#39;s the best diagnosis there is so far.<br/>\n(I&#39;ll be checking out the link to NAET (?) that was posted...thanks for the<br/>\ntip).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe description that was allured posted was pretty good and I definitely<br/>\nagree about Devin Starland&#39;s books.  Excellent resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been dealing with this condition for at least 10 years, diagnosed for<br/>\nthe last 7 or 8.  It can be very debilitating and frustrating.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nfortunate because my doctors believe me.  OTOH if one more person tells me<br/>\nthat I&#39;ll feel better if I exercise...!!!...well, it will not be pretty.<br/>\nPretty hard to exercise when my goal for the week is to get dressed more<br/>\ndays than not.  I often have to use a wheelchair when I go out.  For the<br/>\nlast several months, if there is not someone around to push my chair I can&#39;t<br/>\ngo anywhere.  The most recent doc assures me that the odds are in my favor<br/>\nthat I will have a remission, especially since I&#39;ve been in such pain for so<br/>\nlong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendations:  Do anything that feels like it will be helpful.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad more than one doc tell me that I can probably do more for myself than<br/>\nthey&#39;ll be able to do for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid to insist on pain meds if you need them and don&#39;t be afraid<br/>\nto fire any doc that won&#39;t listen to you.  If the office staff is not<br/>\ncooperative and you can&#39;t gain access to the doctor, find another.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t feel that if you have to take time off from normal every day<br/>\nactivities that your children will suffer irreparable harm.  They&#39;ll simply<br/>\ngrow in a different direction than you had originally planned.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn all you can about this condition or any others that may mimic it.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot confident that I have a complete diagnosis at this time, but the docs<br/>\nhave pursued every reasonable path to try to identify something else.  Until<br/>\nmore is learned or there is reason to repeat tests, I&#39;m stuck with FMS as a<br/>\nprimary diagnosis.  Unfortunately, insurance companies try to use the &#39;it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exist/isn&#39;t a real illness&#39; excuse to deny assistance.  I&#39;m starting<br/>\nthe battle now for a power chair.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re comfortable with joining a support group, I highly recommend it!<br/>\nAn online group is great because you don&#39;t actually have to GO someplace to<br/>\nparticipate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll add to the other offer...if there is anything I can do to help, feel<br/>\nfree to send me a note on or off list (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brownville77@...\">Brownville77@...</a>).  I&#39;d be happy<br/>\nto help in any way I can.  This can be a very lonely condition.  I&#39;m lucky<br/>\nif I get out more than once a week these days.  Getting to a doctor or any<br/>\nother appointment is a major ordeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15020,"nextTopicId":15727}}
