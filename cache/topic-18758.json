belated reply to stuff from a month ago or so- thanks to the folks that <br/>\ngave positive feedback about me writing here, i&#39;m never sure whether to jump <br/>\nin especially in a discussion among parents, which i&#39;m not yet... someone <br/>\nasked me what it was like coming to college after unschooling... it was like <br/>\neveryone was getting used to an unstructured life while i had to deal with <br/>\nmore structure, i felt a little backwards of everyone, and there is a matter <br/>\nof cultural history that i don&#39;t share to the same degree, when people bond <br/>\nabout middle or high school experiences, i used to feel left out some, and <br/>\nshy about bringing up homeschooling, because while they can banter equally <br/>\nabout school back and forth, bringing up homeschooling turns the <br/>\nconversation over to me answering questions a lot of the time... in a <br/>\nreceptive group that can be very rewarding though... and it is interesting <br/>\nto listen to others&#39; culture, its just as when someone is talking about <br/>\npeople you don&#39;t know or tv shows you haven&#39;t seen or if someone comes here <br/>\nfrom a different country without knowing the pop icons and such... i can ask <br/>\nquestions, to stay in the conversation, and learn more about other&#39;s point <br/>\nof view.<br/>\nacademically i came to a school where there are no required courses and you <br/>\ndo independent work for each of your classes, so you make your own <br/>\ncurriculum, perfect for me... though i must say i am very bad at sticking to <br/>\ndeadlines, because i have a &#39;time is in our mind&#39; philosophy that whatever <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get done today, can be done tomorrow or the next day... from <br/>\nhomeschooling, where this is true, it is hard to come to school where things <br/>\nare run on a clock and calendar and if you don&#39;t get it done by x date you <br/>\ndon&#39;t get credit... i show up late for things and get extensions on <br/>\nassignments, maybe more my personality but i think homeschooling let me see <br/>\ntime in an unclocked light and i&#39;ll always prefer it that way.<br/>\nits good to keep reading this list, i&#39;ve been stuck in the book that i&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to write about homeschooling, its hard to write about myself and to <br/>\nshow how my journey t unschooling was natural and much better for me than <br/>\nthe huge institution of school- also i got a real mean letter from a teacher <br/>\nthreatening to take away credit if i don&#39;t write more, i think i want to put <br/>\nthat in the book, as an example of a school tactic that&#39;s counterproductive- <br/>\nhe made me too upset to write much at all! :-)<br/>\ni am rememering lately the homeschooling ideas that helped me: keeping a log <br/>\nof what i actually did in a day, rather than what i planned on doing... felt <br/>\na lot more productive that way... also, remembering to deschool every once <br/>\nin a while, is very necessary... this college thing goes on too long, i <br/>\nsometimes wish i&#39;d kept unschooling all the way, tho its been great to meet <br/>\nteachers and lovers of learning and to get a whole new vocabulary in liberal <br/>\narts college, i wouldn&#39;t trade that.... its expanded my ideas politically <br/>\nemotionally spiritually physically, put my energy into a broader context of <br/>\nwhat the world is doing... how i can be of service to the world... <br/>\nunschooling was sometimes too me-focused, i needed to learn how to network, <br/>\ncollaborate, and accept criticism: this is hardest, because for the past 12 <br/>\nyears i&#39;ve been the authority on my own work...<br/>\nay well i tend to ramble just wanted to say thanks for your feedback and i&#39;m <br/>\nstill listening... are there any unschoolers on  this list near portland, <br/>\noregon? i may be moving there come summer. i&#39;ve been in ny for far too long. <br/>\n;-)<br/>\nlove and light,<br/>\nlarla dey :-)<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18733,"nextTopicId":18759}}
