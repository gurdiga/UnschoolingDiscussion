It&#39;s my luxury to enjoy hot water and bubbles, <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s my pleasure to read, and it&#39;s the time for daddy and the boys to <br/>\n&gt; do whatever the heck they want without my interference.  And it keeps <br/>\n&gt; me sane.  Meeting other people&#39;s needs all day long and pretending <br/>\n&gt; that my only need is to please the people around me wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\n&gt; healthy for me, and it wouldn&#39;t be healthy for them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s the thing, I do LOTS of things for me and I don&#39;t just pretend my <br/>\nonly need is to please the people around me.  I just spent a wonderful <br/>\nweekend at a beautiful bed and breakfast because it was MY need, MY desire to <br/>\nbe pampered myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one resented me for that.  I have long bubble baths myself, not every <br/>\nnight but several times a week.  Sometimes one of the children will come in <br/>\nto sit and chat with me, sometimes not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI read a lot.  I crochet and knit layettes for infants who have passed so <br/>\nthat their parents have something beautiful to see them in for the first and <br/>\nsometimes last time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also do other things with grieving parents and siblings.  That is for me.  <br/>\nLot of things are for me.  But I still think it&#39;s important to make each of <br/>\nmy children feel special and loved and know that there is at least one person <br/>\nin the world who thinks they are the most special person ever born.  I want <br/>\nthem to know that I am grateful I am their mother and that they are precious <br/>\nto me in every way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want them to feel like they&#39;ve been wrapped in that cozy well worn quilt <br/>\nand surrounded by a mothers arms and some days it&#39;s probably too warm to be <br/>\nwrapped up in that quilt or they are just too busy and that&#39;s fine with me <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I might be angry if I didn&#39;t have other things that were done just <br/>\nfor me.  I could see how one might become angry if they felt they HAD to do <br/>\nany certain thing for their child and they had no life other than to please <br/>\nothers.  I don&#39;t think that would be blessing anyone at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66600,"nextTopicId":66647}}
