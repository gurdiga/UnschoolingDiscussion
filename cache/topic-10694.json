No meat, dairy, or eggs. I also have a <br/>\nvegan daughter, another daughter who is a vegetarian by necessity (she has <br/>\nPKU) and my 9 year old son told me almost a month ago he wanted to become <br/>\nvegetarian and has done marvelously with it so far. I&#39;m not pressuring him in <br/>\nany way and he decides what he wants to eat and he has not come close to <br/>\neating meat in the last few weeks. I&#39;m very proud of him. He does still eat <br/>\ncheese sometimes though and an occasional egg. I&#39;m hoping that eventually <br/>\nhe&#39;ll want to avoid those. My husband though is still very much a meat eater. <br/>\nHe will tell me he thinks we&#39;re doing the right thing to go meatless and that <br/>\nhe wants to do it too but he never lasts more than a day. Oh well, it&#39;s his <br/>\nchoice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all you Vegetarians/Vegans....

Vegan Vittles is very good with nice familiar foods. I also <br/>\nhave Ecological Cooking and The Uncheese Cookbook by her and like both of <br/>\nthem very much. Ecological Cooking in particular has lots and lots of recipes <br/>\nso it&#39;s easy to find something in there that I can cook. The Vegetarian Times <br/>\ncookbook has a lot of tasty stuff though many of the recipes are lacto-ovo <br/>\nand so I don&#39;t use them. Same with the Moosewood Cookbook and anything else <br/>\nby Molly Katzen. Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone by Deborah Madison is <br/>\nexcellent though not vegan exclusively. Even more than cookbooks, I&#39;d <br/>\nrecommend Diet for a New America by John Robbins for anyone willing to <br/>\nconsider going vegetarian/vegan. It&#39;s such an eye-opener. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;  We cut out meat for a couple of weeks, but I was having a hard time <br/>\n </span></blockquote>getting <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  enough protien, (my blood sugar, energy, and mood were wild)  I love eggs <br/>\n&gt; but <br/>\n&gt;  can&#39;t eat them because my nursling has bouts of screaming and tummy pains, <br/>\n&gt; if <br/>\n&gt;  I eat them or take protien suppliments....he is not to bad with beans, but <br/>\n&gt;  really how many beans can you really eat.... any suggestions....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>About protein, try out some of the cookbooks I mentioned by Joanne Stepaniak. <br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot you can do with tofu and seitan that is wonderful. You really <br/>\ndon&#39;t need meat or dairy or eggs to get high protein foods. And for a view on <br/>\nhow damaging high protein diets can be and why lower protein is actually <br/>\nbeneficial try some of John McDougall&#39;s books. I&#39;d recommend The McDougall <br/>\nPlan for Women for a very good discussion of osteoporosis. Any of his books <br/>\nare good though. <br/>\n<br/>\nPriss</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Stella","from":"&quot;Stella&quot; &lt;stella@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"JNgfV9Js0o7na4a22iftEKPHPcoGxw2QSEAlMdlIcLUw5YgqXuuymLF12ORB7zJdDUnvMFaDsgDtqIWzz1_q2xXV5d_R18zQKN4ESuBYHjNn7C3Y8jg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Bacon etc./vegans","postDate":"962879824","msgId":10694,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWJmZTc2MSQ0MzQ4MDJlMCQ0YzJhODgzZUBzdGVsbGE+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzA2MDcwNi5lNjY3NlkzMjg1MzVAc20wMTAxLnByb21lZGlhLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11082,"prevInTime":10693,"nextInTime":10695,"topicId":10694,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hello- all this talk of english bacon and chocolate, feel that I must say that even though we live in england we don t eat any of this. we are vegans (strict","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-721013976\">hello- all this talk of english bacon and chocolate, feel that I<br/>\nmust say that even though we live in england we don&#39;t eat any of<br/>\nthis.<br/>\nwe are vegans (strict vegeatarians) and we don&#39;t eat any animal<br/>\nderived ingredients. so no bacon or cadburys chocolate!<br/>\nany more vegans on the list?<br/>\nstella</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11073,"nextTopicId":11094}}
