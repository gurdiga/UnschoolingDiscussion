My husband and I went to a parenting seminar once that <br/>\nreccommended a similar method as Eirauls 3 strikes, but it was a bit more <br/>\nformal. It really does work wonders. I&#39;ll see if I can explain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst you make House Rules. No More than four-I think the ones I used were <br/>\nNo physical Violence, No Rudeness, Do your chores, and Do Homework (we were <br/>\nstill in school then)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing you do is rank privledges-5 things that your kids <br/>\nlike-maybe T.V., Nintendo, playing outside, whatever. You rank them so the <br/>\none they love the most is the last on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you make your X chart. Everytime one of the house rules is violated, <br/>\nthe offender gets an X. The first two X&#39;s are freebies, the third one, they <br/>\nlose the first privledge. Another X, they lose the next privledge. At the <br/>\nseminar they said that for young kids like yours they only lose the <br/>\nprivledge for the day, but older kids-like mine-they lose it for the rest of <br/>\nthe week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was perfect here. It was all there in black and white, the rules as <br/>\nwell as the price for breaking them. There was no whining about it, or <br/>\nbegging me, or saying that I wasn&#39;t being fair, because it was the same for <br/>\nall of them. And it was very good for me, because I do tend to let them off <br/>\nthe hook for alot of things. Once the kids realize that you are serious and <br/>\nthat you will not give in, they shape up amazingly quickly. After the first <br/>\nweek, I don&#39;t think anyone ever got as high as 5 X&#39;s. The only thing that <br/>\nreally matters is that you make all the things work for you-if you can&#39;t <br/>\nstick to it, don&#39;t do it. I think that those idle threats are the <br/>\nworst-saying &quot;Stop or you won&#39;t go to the birthday party&quot; when you know darn <br/>\nwell that you are going to go no matter what. Those are the things that make <br/>\nyour kids not pay attention to what you say-they aren&#39;t stupid, they know <br/>\nthey can get away with ignoring you. So, if you can&#39;t live with saying No <br/>\nPlaying Outside, then don&#39;t make that one of the things they lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps-good luck-and know that you are not alone, we all go through <br/>\nthis sort of thing at one time or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"JENNIFE30@aol.com","from":"JENNIFE30@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UCca0W__O5pdNIVJii5ne_quqFuaKulgJ4TsdOHNt22MWSqxU63wD6tqj_VgSNUUtnMMrbXbcP0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] from the sassy kids&#39; mom","postDate":"965028008","msgId":11651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2LjhkOTBlZmYuMjZiNjgyYThAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11667,"prevInTime":11650,"nextInTime":11652,"topicId":11651,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Annette, I ve just finished reading the responses to the sassy e-mail you sent before and I feel very lucky to digest such a wide variety of responses and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1277168649\">Hi Annette,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just finished reading the responses to the &#39;sassy&#39; e-mail you sent <br/>\nbefore and I feel very lucky to digest such a wide variety of responses and <br/>\ninformation.  This forum is such a wonderful thing.  I can only imagine how <br/>\nhard it was for my mom, and others, who had problems come up and didn&#39;t have <br/>\nsuch a resourse.  And, even with the resourses, it still isn&#39;t an easy <br/>\nthing,,,(and ,,,hey, who said it would be?!!)<br/>\nI have a 9 yr old daughter who is extemely strong willed and bright (aren&#39;t <br/>\nthey all, really!), who has been a source of great frustration, and my <br/>\ngreatest teacher.  I have handled her sassyness/rudeness in different ways at <br/>\ndifferent times, and it seems to me now that it has had to do more with where <br/>\nI am at the moment, than with her outbursts.<br/>\n  When I am out of sorts, frustrated, or in stressful times I tend to do the <br/>\n&quot;ok, that&#39;s it, i&#39;m sorry, but you can&#39;t talk to me like that&quot; and there are <br/>\nconsequenses, etc.  <br/>\nWhen I am balanced, and my needs are being met, it seems I have much more <br/>\npatience and I am willing to ask her questions &quot;is there something that is <br/>\nbothering you&quot;, &quot;is there something that you need that you aren&#39;t feeling <br/>\nlike you&#39;re getting right now&quot;, &quot;what is this really about&quot;.  Sometimes I can <br/>\nsee she is just tired, or overwhelmed, but there are times when I have asked <br/>\na question like this and the answer is nothing that I could have ever <br/>\nexpected and it led to a great conversation, and a greater awareness of where <br/>\nshe is and who she is.  <br/>\nIf I am really honest with myself, I think there are times (I am a single <br/>\nmom) where I know I don&#39;t have the inward resourses to really be able to <br/>\nhandle the answer to a question like &#39;what do you really need right <br/>\nnow&#39;,,,,,where the answer would be, &#39;i just need your undivided attention <br/>\nwith no interruptions&#39;, when I, myself feel empty and overwhelmed.  <br/>\nI know I am a &#39;good mom&#39;, we all are, we&#39;re all doing the best we can.  And <br/>\nyet, there is always room for improvement, but I know the answer is not to <br/>\nbeat myself up because I didn&#39;t do it right or perfectly, because there is no <br/>\nsuch thing.  I keep finding the better I am to myself, the kinder I am to <br/>\nmyself, the kinder I am to my daughter.  The more I listen to, and respect <br/>\nmyself, the more I listen to , and respect my daughter.  And, since in the <br/>\npast, I have had an issue with perfectionism, I keep hearing something: <br/>\n&#39;Growth is not an event, it&#39;s a process&#39;.  It&#39;s not some place to get to, <br/>\nit&#39;s an ever winding, ever discovering vehicle.  The &#39;answers&#39; will come only <br/>\nto facilitate new questions.  It&#39;s all been a wonderful ride and just keeps <br/>\ngetting better :-)  I feel honored to have the opportunity to be at home with <br/>\nmy daughter, no matter what challenges have come up.  I know this is not the <br/>\n&#39;norm&#39;, in societal terms, and I relish the opportunity to live our lives <br/>\ntogether in this way.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t usually write on here and just want to thank everyone for their <br/>\ninput, it&#39;s been very helpful and insightful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11678,"nextTopicId":11680}}
