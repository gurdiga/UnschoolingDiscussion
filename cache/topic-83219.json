If even unschoolers label themselves in terms of &quot;school&quot; that&#39;s <br/>\nsomething to think about. Maybe it says more about those grocery clerks who are so <br/>\ncurious about a child out and about on a &quot;school day&quot; than it does about the <br/>\nhomeschooler. Maybe it says hsing isn&#39;t as accepted and natural seeming an idea <br/>\nas it should be, among those who choose not to hs -- and even among some <br/>\nhsers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it says we&#39;re just not all that bright. We need to label each other. <br/>\nAnd we label each other in terms of our jobs, some of the time. &quot;There&#39;s Jim, <br/>\nthe fireman. There&#39;s Molly, the lawyer. Oh, that&#39;s Nance, she stays at home with <br/>\nher kids and homeschools -- can you believe it.&quot; We&#39;re just not very clever <br/>\nin talking to one another. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a lot of grownups are horrible, just horrible, at talking to kids. DD was <br/>\nrelieved the other day when an older gentleman at the deli counter did NOT <br/>\nask her too much about school -- only asked if all her homework was done; it was <br/>\n:) -- but then he proceeded to ask her about -- ta da!! -- other things. What <br/>\nshe liked at the deli, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe proclaimed later that he was a pretty boring old man, but at least he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t ask her what grade she was in! Gosh, how many times has she been asked <br/>\nthat stupid question?  Grownups just don&#39;t seem to know what to talk to kids <br/>\nabout so they fall back on these stock questons -- which may be completely <br/>\ninappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it just seems to me that it&#39;s a small idea to ponder -- getting past all <br/>\nthe other fluff in the article -- why we label each other in terms of &quot;school&quot; <br/>\nat all. We need to describe each other, to know each other somehow and this is <br/>\nthe best we can do? Not very impressive. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd &quot;Hello list&quot; -- Nance here, unschooling Mom to 2 fantastic kids in <br/>\nFlorida. (But I do other things too and you might describe me completely differently <br/>\nin a different context. :) )<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83208,"nextTopicId":83189}}
