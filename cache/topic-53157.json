My ds-9 threw it after losing to his Dad in a football game.  Dad tried to fix it but it was beyond repair.  We did talk about getting so angry, how to avoid breaking things, etc.... but no lecture.  I told him what a bummer it was and that he would have to spend his money to replace it.  He said &quot;Sure, I know.  I won&#39;t do that again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe shall see, but my bet is that he will be more careful in the future.  Dad did make a special trip to Walmart just to get the new controller (he was upset too that they couldn&#39;t play against each other any more) so he only did without for a few hours.  Ds luckily had some Christmas money left over and was able to replace it and get another memory card for about $15.<br/>\n<br/>\nKimber  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1941157,"authorName":"Natrlmama@aol.com","from":"Natrlmama@...","profile":"natrlmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Interesting things..","postDate":"1041822892","msgId":53262,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFjLjM1NzJlYWMxLjJiNGE0ZWFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53250,"nextInTopic":53277,"prevInTime":53261,"nextInTime":53263,"topicId":53157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/5/03 2:05:27 PM Pacific Standard Time, grlynbl@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1479838559\">In a message dated 1/5/03 2:05:27 PM Pacific Standard Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; But, I still am <br/>\n at a loss for what ( if any) consequence is natural for breaking the <br/>\n controller out of anger. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe natural consequences are already playing out I am sure.

Dh and Ethan got up around 6am to go meet BIL to go to <br/>\nthis house on the lake that my SIL boss GAVE them.. YEAH.. she works for a <br/>\ncouple of doctors ( husband and wife) and they bought a house on the lake <br/>\nthat they decided they didnt want.. They were going to just have it <br/>\ndemolished and rebuild on the lot, but  they &quot;gave&quot; the house to my  b and <br/>\nsil... They couldnt move it.. it was partially underground.. but they have <br/>\nbeen taking every possible item/material out of it that they can.. They <br/>\noffered us to come get anything we wanted too.   We figured this was an older <br/>\nranch style home with little salvagable.. But, OH NO. it was  HUGE, <br/>\nimmacualte, stucco home with top of the line fixtures and construction.   It <br/>\nis just blowing our mind that folks are going to TEAR DOWN a perfectly good, <br/>\nactually wonderful home.  This home would probably sell for over 200K!! <br/>\nAnyway, we&#39;ve been so fortunate to get out light fixtures, garage doors, <br/>\nmolding, sinks, vanities, mirrors. ceiling fans..ect.  What I REALLY want is <br/>\nthe outdoor jacuzzi spa!!. But, its in the ground and we dont ahve the <br/>\nequipment to dig it up and move it.   These folks also had a huge garden tub <br/>\nwhirlpool in thier house.  Its so big, we dont have anywhere in our house to <br/>\nput it.   OK.. so.. ( I know, a bit of background there.. lol) Dh and Ethan <br/>\nwent back to the house yesterday to get some more goodies.  Ethan ws SOO <br/>\nexcited to be going with Daddy to be helping out.    Anna was spending the <br/>\nnight with my folks.  Me, JP and Landon all slept late.   Well, I got up <br/>\nbefore the boys and did my post obsessing while they were still asleep.   <br/>\nWhen JP got up, he wanted to play XBOX.   That posed a problem, which I would <br/>\nappreciate some feedback/suggestions on.   Ethan got mad at his game the day <br/>\nbefore, he often loses his temper in frustration.. He threw the controller <br/>\ndown and broke it.   So, whats the natural consequnce to that?  I told Ethan <br/>\nhe would ahve to buy another controller .. That seems appropiate to me.  But <br/>\nin the mean time, what about the rest of the family??? Now JP ( or anyone <br/>\nelse for that matter) cant play XBOX either.   I really dont have the $30 to <br/>\nbuy another controller.. If I DO scrape up the $$, then what? dont let Ethan <br/>\nplay with it til he buys another one?  Or should I make everyone suffer til <br/>\nEthan comes up with the $$ to buy a new one.???  Of course JP was upset that <br/>\nthe controller was broken and he threw a fit of his own.  Screaming and <br/>\nkicking and generally being enraged because the controller was broken.  I <br/>\nfinally got him calmed down and told him we would go buy groceries and go get <br/>\nsome lunch.   Landon got up and he wanted to go with us.. He was washing his <br/>\nclothes, so we waited on him to finish his laundry.   JP and I played Army <br/>\nmen and Nintendo while Landons clothes dried.  Landon washed the dishes and <br/>\ncleaned the kitchen.  I folded some laundry that Landon brought up out of the <br/>\ndryer.  I picked up some toys off the landing at the top of our stairs.  JP <br/>\nrode his bike.  I called Anna and checked in with her to see what she was <br/>\ngoing to do.  My Mom was going up to my Grandparents ( I could interject <br/>\nanother long background story here.. but I wont. :-) )  She said she could <br/>\ndrop Anna off on her way, or Anna could stay with Grandpa.  I told her we <br/>\nwere getting ready to leave, but either way was fine with me, whatever Anna <br/>\nwanted to do.   Just as we were leaving, Dh and Ethan got home from their <br/>\nadventure.  Ethan was so excited to show me all the stuff they got ( GREAT <br/>\nstuff too)   Then, Landon, JP and I left to run our errands.   We decided to <br/>\neat at Pizza Hut... Landon kicked in $5 because he has more $$ than I do.. <br/>\nLOL.  My budget was more like Taco Bell, but they really wanted Pizza Hut, so <br/>\nLandon offered to help pay..  The pizza was great, after dinner we went over <br/>\nto Big Lots to let JP spend a couple of dollars.  JP wanted a Harry Potter <br/>\nplay set that was $12.. I couldnt swing it.. He threw another tantrum in the <br/>\nstore.  I told him he could chose something else, or we would have to leave. <br/>\nAfter much persuasion, he chose a micro machine set that was $3.. That was <br/>\nwithin my budget, so we were both happy and we made the purchase.   Then onto <br/>\nthe grocery store.  We got our groceries and headed on home.. I stopped at <br/>\nthe video store and we got a DVD to watch that night.   We got home @ 4.. And <br/>\nJP had a wonderful surprise!! ( another background fill in)<br/>\n I had bought him a viewmaster projector for Christmas and he only had 6 <br/>\nreels to look at.  I had joined a Viewmaster group on yahoo and posted a note <br/>\nthat i was looking for a good source for VM reels for my 7yo.  A wondeful <br/>\nfella emailed me and offered to send JP some duplicate reels that he had on <br/>\nhand.  I  accepted graciously and offered to pay him for them.. He said.  no <br/>\nno. they are just collecting dust, Ill be glad to give them to him.. I asked <br/>\nhim to address the package to Jon Phillip because I knew he would love to get <br/>\nsome mail  So.. when we got home the package was there.  I hadnt told JP <br/>\nabout the reels.  I expected there to be a dozen or so reels.. The fella has <br/>\nsent close to 100!.. ALL kinds.. cartoons, history, places and people, <br/>\nEVERYTHING.. I was so ecstatic.. And was JP. He was thrilled..  I was so <br/>\ntouched by the kindness and generosity of this &quot;stranger&quot;  JP is going to <br/>\nwrite him a thank  you note and mail it.  I am constantly inspired by the <br/>\ngenuine goodness of folks.  That was really the highlight of our day.  We <br/>\ndidnt get a chance to look at the reels, as JP only has the projector and we <br/>\ndidnt get it out last night.  I am getting him a regular viewer VM ASAP.  <br/>\nAnother VM enthusiast has the older black models for sale for $2.00 each.. <br/>\nThats next on my list for Paypal.. :-)  After the view master excitement,   I <br/>\ncalled Anna and told her that we were thinking about going to the matinee at <br/>\n4:30 to see TT.  I knew she really wanted to see it.  She said that Grandma <br/>\nhad already left and that she was going to spend the night with my sister ( <br/>\nwho lives next door to my folks) and babysit my nieces.  I offered to come <br/>\nget her, but she said it was OK.. we would go see the movie again later.   <br/>\nSo, we loaded up and headed to the theater.  This was Landons 3rd time seeing <br/>\nthe movie!  First time for the rest of us.  We throughly enjoyed it.   When <br/>\nit was over.. JP said.. &quot;that wasnt what I was expecting, it didnt seem like <br/>\n3 hours to me&quot;  I think he expected to get sleepy and bored.. lol.. but he <br/>\ndidnt, he watched the whole movie intently . Well, with the aid of some candy <br/>\nand drink...lol.  After the movie, we came home and made ourselves some <br/>\nsupper.  Landon made a frozen pizza for himself and JP  Ethan, Dh and I ate a <br/>\nrotisseire cooked pork loin that I bought on sale at the grocery store.... Dh <br/>\nhad to go to the hardware store to get some more propane for our heater.  I <br/>\ngot back online to do some more obsessing.   When Dh got back, I made some <br/>\nginger bread cookies ( refrigerated dough, not homemade.. lol)  We had <br/>\ncoffee, milk and cookies and put the DVD in.. It was Snatch, and Landon had <br/>\nheard it was really good.  The little boys were playing Mario Kart <br/>\ncontendedtly , til we put the movie in, ( of course)  We werent sure if the <br/>\ncontent was appropiate for them, so we kept delaying and delaying starting <br/>\nthe movie til they occupied with playing again.. FINALLY, they wandered out <br/>\nand started playing again.. And I watched Snatch while Dh worked on a bike ( <br/>\nhe collects and restores vintage bikes) and Landon chatted online with his <br/>\nbuds ( our PC is in our bedroom, as is our DVD player).. The movie was GREAT. <br/>\nI LOVE LOVE Beniccio Del Toro.. :-)    The movie was actually fine for the <br/>\nboys to watch.  A lot of the F word, a lot of shooting and killing,  a few <br/>\nglimpses topless women.. but all in all, nothing theyve not seen before.   I <br/>\nmostly dont want them to see explicit sexual content or anything too <br/>\n&quot;scary&quot;.. Sometime yesterday, they watched a bit of &quot;Freddy Krueger&quot; on TV <br/>\nand neither of them could go to sleep. ( or take a shower, or go downstairs <br/>\nby themselves)  JP slept with us last nigh because of Freddy.. After Landon <br/>\nfinally got offline around midnight.. I got on and did some more obsessing..  <br/>\nG ( my husbands name is Gralyn, and I call him G on all my other groups.. so, <br/>\nDh is harder for me to use.. So, I&#39;ll just use G) Anyway, G finished working <br/>\non his bike, then we went to bed.  Its 11:00 now, I got up around 10 (started <br/>\nobsessing)  G is gone to church( he plays the organ)   JP  is watching TV in <br/>\nbed,Landon is still in bed and Ethan is playing Nintendo.. G is going back to <br/>\n&quot;the house&quot; today after lunch and I think we are all going today.. We have to <br/>\nborrow my Dads truck to get some more stuff.  We will pick Anna up when we <br/>\nget the truck.. JP is really excited about going the &quot;the house&quot; today.    I <br/>\nneed to get downstairs and get some lunch ready.   OH.. JP just threw <br/>\nsomething down the stairs.. !!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53602,"nextTopicId":53659}}
