And, I had a great time, though I cried half the <br/>\nweekend because I didn&#39;t have my kids with me. *lame*  The conference <br/>\nwas amazing, and I&#39;m already really looking forward to next year! Ren, <br/>\nlet me know if there&#39;s anything I can do to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was lucky enough to pick up the last set of Sandra&#39;s thinking sticks, <br/>\nand Emily (7) loves them! We played twice last night and again this <br/>\nmorning, and she&#39;s asking to play again and finding new ways to play <br/>\nwith them. For those who don&#39;t know, the sticks are about making <br/>\nconnnections. So, you throw out two sticks, which will have two <br/>\ndifferent categories on them, and those playing make connections between <br/>\nthe two.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, Emily seemed so amazing to me--it was great to see how her <br/>\nmind works. Even at 7, she was making some really interesting <br/>\nconnections. She got computers/ containers and said that computers were <br/>\n&quot;like a big storage box of knowledge.&quot; Then she got safety/ economics <br/>\nand made the connection that lifeguards have to pay money for <br/>\ncertifications to get their job. For music/ cooking, she made up a cool <br/>\nsong about cooking in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Sandra! Well worth the money!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98614,"nextTopicId":98932}}
