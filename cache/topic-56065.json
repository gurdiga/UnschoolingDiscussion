Not cos I think my kids will hand out my IP address or email online but to stop hackers. We get our ports scanned every few minutes. Hackers use automatic software to detect vunerable ports.<br/>\nMy computer is always in stealth mode. If you go to Privacy International you can get additional free software to protect your computer - there&#39;s even stuff that blocks Carnivore :-). Apart from yahoogroups email, my private email is encrypted so only people that have the key can read it. I can&#39;t remember<br/>\nwhere I got that from but I&#39;ll look it up if anyone is interested. The downside is your recipient must have the same software.<br/>\nGuess I&#39;m just paranoid :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"internet dangers","postDate":"1043382586","msgId":56065,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmIwMWMyYzM2MSQzOTlmNGIyMCRiNTU3NTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56125,"prevInTime":56064,"nextInTime":56066,"topicId":56065,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone mentioned on the late night thread I think about the dangers of the internet.
