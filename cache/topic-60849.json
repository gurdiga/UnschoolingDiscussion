Unschoolers beware! Do not read if <br/>\n  violence towards children will ruin your day. Seriously.  I can&#39;t <br/>\n  even believe this stuff still goes on in our schools. THIS will help <br/>\n  some people understand why I think  things are different in the <br/>\n  South. Ugh.&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you really want to put yourself into total shock about what is <br/>\n  actually going on in the schools go get a job as a substitute <br/>\n  teacher, especially in an urban school system.  I have written <br/>\n  volumes from my &quot;in the trenches&quot; experience as a sub.  It is so much <br/>\n  worse than most can imagine.  So if you live in an urban area and can <br/>\n  qualify for a sub license or certificate then try it, just for a <br/>\n  little while, and you will quickly know why we homeschool and why we <br/>\n  unschool.  So much psychological brutality out there that it amazes <br/>\n  me.  And the folks doing it really believe they are helping the <br/>\n  children.  I even run into parents who still say to me that if the <br/>\n  schools would just reinstate the paddle that things would be much <br/>\n  better!  I take the time to talk to them, to try to get them to <br/>\n  understand a different point of view.  Sometimes I think a little bit <br/>\n  gets through.  Most of the time, not.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  And I don&#39;t live in Florida, or the south, but in the heart of the <br/>\n  midwest, in Ohio.  Some days it is just too much and I can&#39;t sub <br/>\n  again for a long time.  Right now I am about to do some other <br/>\n  contract work, which will give me another bit to write about, <br/>\n  correcting state proficiency exams from different states.  That will <br/>\n  keep me out of the schools for the rest of this school year, but I am <br/>\n  sure I will have an even more interesting subject to report after six <br/>\n  months of learning all about these tests and how they are graded.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  If you&#39;re not up to subjecting yourself to being in the schools just <br/>\n  rest assured that paddling is not the worst of what is going on in <br/>\n  many of them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Norma<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SosinkyHS\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SosinkyHS</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

She was not surprised just noting something that happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot wanting to offend her and make her defensive but still wanting to make <br/>\nher think, I said I was appalled that schools still did that.  I thought that <br/>\nwas abandoned years ago.  She said Oh no but now you have to sign a consent <br/>\nform to allow them to do it.  I said I couldn&#39;t imagine a stranger laying a <br/>\nhand on my child and me not going off the handle.  And the embarrassment of <br/>\ndoing it in front of peers.  I told her how I would feel if that happened to <br/>\nme. Imagine signing a paper to allow your child to be hit. I know she does <br/>\nspank at home as a form of punishment.  She kind of paused for a minute and <br/>\nthought about it.  Not sure if anything came out of our little conversation <br/>\nand of course we talked more about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n It amazes her that I don&#39;t use punishment and yet have well Behaved kids.  I <br/>\nhate those words too &quot;well behaved.&quot;  No one ever says that about me.  Is <br/>\nthat supposed to mean I am a good parent?  <br/>\nAnyway enough rambling for this morning.<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60996,"nextTopicId":61098}}
