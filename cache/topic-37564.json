I <br/>\nhappened to go to a library that we didn&#39;t normally use and saw a beautiful <br/>\nbook about herb gardens around the world.

They&#39;d been buried in the bottom of this box and I pulled <br/>\nthem out and left them on the dining room table just because they hadn&#39;t been <br/>\navailable for a while (being buried in the bottom of a box) and I thought <br/>\nmaybe somebody might like to fool with them. My husband started playing with <br/>\nthem first and my daughter and her friend got in on it too, later. They&#39;re <br/>\nstill sitting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis wasn&#39;t superimposing my likes over theirs  - it was making something <br/>\navailable IF they felt like using it. They could have left them sitting on <br/>\nthe table for a day or a week  and everybody could have ignored them until <br/>\nthey got put away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also leave the new magazines lying around - so people can see that they&#39;ve <br/>\narrived and choose to look them over, if they want to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, Rosie said, &quot;THANKS Mommy, for finding the pattern blocks.&quot;<br/>\nShe hadn&#39;t asked for them, but was glad to see them resurface.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Had I kept them fully involved in the overlapping <br/>\n </span></blockquote>parts, they may never have found the outer parts of the circles.  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - strewing doesn&#39;t mean keeping the kids involved in something you are <br/>\nalso involved in. It just means THINKING about them and knowing them, being <br/>\nable to guess that something might interest them and leaving it out where <br/>\nthey can find it and decide for themselves if it does, in fact, interest <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, the consequence of having the five of us with varied i <br/>\n </span></blockquote>nterests in one house has not led to an unstrewn house but no one <br/>\ndoes it with the intent of seeing if anyone else is interested.  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you were in the library and ran across a book that you thought would <br/>\ninterest your daughter -- you&#39;d never bring it home and leave it on the table <br/>\nwhere she&#39;d be sure to find it? You&#39;d object to that? You&#39;d think that was <br/>\nsuperimposing your own interests over that of the child? <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I think that some people&#39;s lifestyles are very very calm and they are <br/>\nsort of &quot;minimalist&quot; families. If they brought in a book from the library, <br/>\nthey&#39;d hand it to the kid and talk to them about it, etc. In my family, I <br/>\nmight put it on the shelf where we keep the library books and then let it go <br/>\nfrom my mind -- knowing that the kids will be rummaging through that shelf <br/>\nand will stumble across it and, if it interests them, they&#39;ll take a look at <br/>\nit. I don&#39;t need to remember to introduce it to them - just need to leave it <br/>\nsomewhere they&#39;ll find it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other families, especially those with kids just out of school, even a <br/>\nparent just suggesting a book to a kid might be &quot;felt&quot; by the kid as if it is <br/>\nan assignment. So kids might be a bit resistant to recommendations by their <br/>\nparents, for a while.
