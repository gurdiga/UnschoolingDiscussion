The author of the Redwall books. My son Nicholas,<br/>\n9<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years old, reads them for hours on end. You would be able to purchase<br/>\n&gt; &gt;them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; anywhere. Or at least you should be able to. Some of the book titles<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Redwall, Marlfox, Pearls of Lutra, Legend of Luke, Mossflower,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Mattimeo,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastrom, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Outcast of Redwall, The long Patrol, The Great Redwall Feast (this is<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; short BEAUTIFUL book, that even my 5 year old enjoys). There are<br/>\n&gt; &gt;probably<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more, but he has read all but two of these books. They range anywhere<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about maybe 350 to 450 or so pages, except for the Redwall Feast,<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about 30 pages or so, with gorgeous illustrations. The books are just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fantastic. There are parts in them with some of the characters<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; killed or whatnot, but I feel Nicholas has dealt with the stories<br/>\nfine,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they fuel his imagination tremendously.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We have checked most of them out at the library, however they would<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to own and we are planning on getting his Brian Jacques library<br/>\n&gt; &gt;expanded<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Have fun!

The author of the Redwall books. My son Nicholas, 9<br/>\n&gt; &gt; years old, reads them for hours on end. You would be able to purchase<br/>\nthem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anywhere. Or at least you should be able to. Some of the book titles are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Redwall, Marlfox, Pearls of Lutra, Legend of Luke, Mossflower, Mattimeo,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastrom, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Outcast of Redwall, The long Patrol, The Great Redwall Feast (this is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; short BEAUTIFUL book, that even my 5 year old enjoys). There are<br/>\nprobably<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more, but he has read all but two of these books. They range anywhere<br/>\nfrom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about maybe 350 to 450 or so pages, except for the Redwall Feast, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about 30 pages or so, with gorgeous illustrations. The books are just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fantastic. There are parts in them with some of the characters getting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; killed or whatnot, but I feel Nicholas has dealt with the stories fine,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they fuel his imagination tremendously.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have checked most of them out at the library, however they would be<br/>\n&gt; nice<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to own and we are planning on getting his Brian Jacques library expanded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; soon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have fun! I&#39;m sure your son/daughter will love them!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, just a quick note, we also ADORE Jane Yolen, good books, full of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagination and magical ideas and lore.
