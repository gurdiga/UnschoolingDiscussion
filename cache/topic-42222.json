However, based on the above, we<br/>\nhomeschoolers do a lot more parenting than folks whose children are in<br/>\nschool all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true that people whose children attend schools talk about these things.<br/>\nAs unschoolers, our children have far more access to &quot;movies, computer<br/>\ngames, etc.&quot; than schooled or schooled-at-home children.  As a result, we<br/>\ndiscuss them here in order to get feedback from folks in our same situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side point...while homeschooling and unschooling are certainly not the<br/>\nsole domain of women, the majority of folks on this list are ladies.<br/>\nSometimes women get off topic and enjoy a silly giggle about a former<br/>\nboyfriend or such.  If the majority of at-home parents handling their<br/>\nchildren&#39;s education were men, the list might get similarly off topic, but<br/>\non different &quot;men&#39;s subjects&quot;.  Humor us, Ned, as we&#39;ve humored you a couple<br/>\ntimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned a lot from discussions of what you consider &quot;just parenting&quot;.<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry they bore you.  But they&#39;re what my life looks like right now, and<br/>\nthis list has been a wonderful gift to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\nwho loved some of these folks&#39; writings in print, and still gets a charge<br/>\nout of seeing their messages in her in-box every day!  :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42132,"nextTopicId":42097}}
