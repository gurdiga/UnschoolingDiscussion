New-to-homeschooling families<br/>\n&gt;sometimes haven&#39;t thought of the range of definition of mathematics.  <br/>\n&gt;School<br/>\n&gt;presents it as a continuum of counting, money, arithmetical functions,<br/>\n&gt;introductory algebra, plane geometry, algebra II, solid geometry, calculus,<br/>\n&gt;trigonometry, as though they belonged in that order as surely as... the<br/>\n&gt;alphabet, or the kings of England.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This morning too early (5:30) a cat woke Holly up.  I was sleeping with <br/>\n&gt;her.<br/>\n&gt;She wanted to go back to sleep.  I asked if she wanted me to read something<br/>\n&gt;boring so she could sleep.  She did.  I picked up the Hirsch 2nd Grade book<br/>\n&gt;and flipped to something that looked boring, and I read it in a soft, slow,<br/>\n&gt;monotonous way.  I was reading about Arabic and Roman numerals.  And then I<br/>\n&gt;continued into measurement.  I did inches and feet and was going to move on<br/>\n&gt;to weights when Holly, NOT asleep, said &quot;What does measuring have to do <br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;Roman numerals?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;DAMN.  #1, she wasn&#39;t bored.<br/>\n&gt;#2, it was making her think, and she was being analytical.<br/>\n&gt;#3, I have studiously, consciously avoided &quot;subject area&quot; descriptors with <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;kids.  So I was not about to say &quot;They&#39;re both considered to be <br/>\n&gt;mathematics.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I wasn&#39;t even going to say &quot;They both have to do with numbers and <br/>\n&gt;counting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  I said, &quot;Oh.  I forgot to read the subject titles so you didn&#39;t know the<br/>\n&gt;next section had started.&quot;  It&#39;s not that my kids don&#39;t know what &quot;history&quot;<br/>\n&gt;and &quot;science&quot; mean; they do.  They could not, though, I think, recite a <br/>\n&gt;list<br/>\n&gt;of the subjects which fall under those headings.  To them, rocks are rocks,<br/>\n&gt;light is light, and plants are plants.  Rocks, light and plants are not all<br/>\n&gt;&quot;science,&quot; to be accepted happily as a group (along with how planes fly and<br/>\n&gt;how soap works) if one &quot;likes science&quot; or rejected if one &quot;hates science.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So back to math.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Holly loves math.  It is her native thought-language.  She loves music, and<br/>\n&gt;sees the math in it--in the distances between notes (intervals) and in the<br/>\n&gt;patterns on the piano keyboard, and in how written music works.  She <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;read music, but she likes to follow along, or have me show her some of the<br/>\n&gt;patterns.  We got the score for Handel&#39;s Water Music Suite (from Dover <br/>\n&gt;books,<br/>\n&gt;cheap) and I&#39;ve played it and showed her how in a full score you can see <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;pattern of the music flowing by.  I didn&#39;t try to get her to listen to the<br/>\n&gt;whole thing, just a couple of pages.  She looked, she got it, she did other<br/>\n&gt;things in the room while the rest played.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That was math.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Holly loves pattern blocks and puzzles involving shapes.  That&#39;s math.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Holly likes Master Mind for Kids.  That is methodical deductive reasoning <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;patterns.  That&#39;s the kind of math computer programmers use.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Holly likes Zoombinis and Third Grade Adventures.  Logic games and patterns<br/>\n&gt;without numbers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Origami.  Making a square piece of paper from an 8.5x11, for starters.  <br/>\n&gt;Sure,<br/>\n&gt;you can buy square Japanese paper, but most kids learn how to make a square<br/>\n&gt;by tearing a piece off, and exactly how to determine which piece to tear <br/>\n&gt;off<br/>\n&gt;by folding, not by using numbers or a ruler.  Math.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Others help build this big picture, please.

She loves music, and <br/>\nsees the math in it--in the distances between notes (intervals) and in the <br/>\npatterns on the piano keyboard, and in how written music works.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>\nread music, but she likes to follow along, or have me show her some of the <br/>\npatterns.  We got the score for Handel&#39;s Water Music Suite (from Dover books, <br/>\ncheap) and I&#39;ve played it and showed her how in a full score you can see the <br/>\npattern of the music flowing by.  I didn&#39;t try to get her to listen to the <br/>\nwhole thing, just a couple of pages.  She looked, she got it, she did other <br/>\nthings in the room while the rest played. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was math.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly loves pattern blocks and puzzles involving shapes.  That&#39;s math.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly likes Master Mind for Kids.  That is methodical deductive reasoning and <br/>\npatterns.  That&#39;s the kind of math computer programmers use. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly likes Zoombinis and Third Grade Adventures.  Logic games and patterns <br/>\nwithout numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrigami.  Making a square piece of paper from an 8.5x11, for starters.  Sure, <br/>\nyou can buy square Japanese paper, but most kids learn how to make a square <br/>\nby tearing a piece off, and exactly how to determine which piece to tear off <br/>\nby folding, not by using numbers or a ruler.  Math.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers help build this big picture, please.  I&#39;ll write more later.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22357,"nextTopicId":22300}}
