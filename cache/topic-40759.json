Many of your posts are <br/>\nwitty, informative, enlightening and interesting. So it puzzles me <br/>\nthat you seem unable to distinguish those posts from the merely <br/>\nobnoxious political propaganda posts that I and others have objected <br/>\nto. And when we do object you try to whitewash the situation by <br/>\nclaiming nonsense such as what you wrote above.

Are you saying <br/>\nyou&#39;ve finally found a group that - some of us, anyway - understands <br/>\nand relates to what you&#39;re trying to say? Did it ever occur to you <br/>\nthat many of us have been here for many years, saying the same <br/>\nthings, and your blatherings are nothing we haven&#39;t heard before <br/>\nhundreds of times? You seem to have risen up from the ranks of this <br/>\nlist to seize some crown of virtuosity - King of the Hairy Unwashed <br/>\nUnschoolers? Well, if you want to be our Fearless Leader, fine. Lead <br/>\non, McDuff. Some will probably follow you, but I think most will <br/>\nprobably do what all good unschoolers do, which is take what&#39;s useful <br/>\nand pitch the rest and go merrily on their own way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In fact, this list just might be where homeschooling should be planning its<br/>\n&gt;national survival, or maybe its great surge to achieve total acceptance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If it&#39;s not here, where?

No, really, I&#39;m interested. I&#39;ve read <br/>\nquite a bit of your writings over the years, not here, but in many <br/>\nother forums.
