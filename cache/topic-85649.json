We live way out in the woods and trees <br/>\noften fall on the power lines.  It was last winter when much of the east coast <br/>\nwas out.  We ended up buying a generator at about day 5 (this happens to us, <br/>\nfor at least 4 or 5 hours or more, about 5 times per year) but before we did we <br/>\nreally enjoyed ourselves.  Lots of card games, stories, board games, etc.   <br/>\nPlus, we have a well run on electric, so no electric means no water.  We had to <br/>\ncarry buckets from the creek and buy drinking water.  The boys all peed in <br/>\nthe woods to keep the water consumption down.  <br/>\n********************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;ANYWAY..I know that I&#39;m rambling..I just wanted to share my thoughts with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>others who understand.

We have one unschooling family about 1 hour away, but <br/>\ntheir youngest is 15, oldest is heading off to college, and they are <br/>\ncrafters/shoe makers that sell at shows and work out of their home, so they&#39;re often too <br/>\nbusy to get together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI, too, have been trying to let go more.  This is the first year we&#39;re <br/>\nhomeschooling our adopted son, who was in special ed at school and floundering, so I <br/>\nworry a little about him.  He is always busy with something though! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there still an email list for &quot;beginning unschoolers?&quot;  I never did sign <br/>\nup for the other lists, though I wish I had<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85590,"nextTopicId":85638}}
