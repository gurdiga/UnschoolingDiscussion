But, to me, <br/>\n&gt; that <br/>\n&gt; fits in the category of waiting until he has an interest and then <br/>\n&gt; supporting it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A lot of the stuff I get for Rain is sort of connected to something she<br/>\nlikes, but different. I got her Heathcliff books when she was interested<br/>\nin Garfield, and TinTin when she was interested in Asterix (or maybe the<br/>\nother way around), and sometimes they catch and sometimes they don&#39;t... <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he read any manga, or has he seen any? It&#39;s also sort of along the<br/>\nlines of a comic book, but different...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are financially very limited, but Borders will let you sit there and<br/>\nread for hours, without buying anything... we do usually buy coffee,<br/>\nwhich is cheaper than a book. They have a better selction than our<br/>\nlibrary, anyway. You can also buy books on ebay and half if you find<br/>\nanything interesting... or put out a call to your local group or friends,<br/>\nmost of the homeschoolers we knows have thousands of books and we borrow<br/>\n(and lend) a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since we aren&#39;t in stores often, because he dislikes shopping, it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; not <br/>\n&gt; hat common for us to even see cool new stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How about online shopping? Then you can just show him the screen. Ebay is<br/>\ntruly awesome, and then if something isn&#39;t a hit you can turn around and<br/>\nsell it again, and not be out much at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about going to the theater, but am often <br/>\n&gt; discouraged <br/>\n&gt; by the ticket prices.  (even if only multiplied by three people)  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Usher! It&#39;s a great way to see shows for free! I know the Davis Musical<br/>\nTheatre Company is always looking for ushers, and they have no minimum<br/>\nage limit for ushers, as long as you can. They&#39;re doing Annie in the<br/>\nadult theatre and the kids are doing Beauty and the Beast (which, in the<br/>\ninterest of full discolsure, Rain is in). Beauty might be more appealing<br/>\n- it&#39;s funnier, and there&#39;s some swordfighting choreographed by a local<br/>\nfencing instructor, and both leads are older teens and just awesome<br/>\n(/plug)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  We don&#39;t talk much.  He doesn&#39;t seem interested in <br/>\n&gt; talking <br/>\n&gt; to me.  Even in the car<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How about putting on NPR in the car and making occasional comments... I<br/>\ndo that naturally, but Rain generally either challenges me or asks a<br/>\nquestion agrees... it&#39;s sort of like getting a conversation going without<br/>\nhis needing to be involved, but then maybe he&#39;d jump in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what are you into now, what are your interests? Is he seeing you<br/>\ngetting excited about new things, learning, growing?  I firmly believe<br/>\nthat &quot;children need interesting mothers&quot; (as Ariel Gore put it) and I<br/>\nthink my getting excited about things that interest me is more important<br/>\nto Rain than anything I buy for her. She sees me eagerly perusing the<br/>\nlatest knitty.com, and jumping on stage when an actress has to leave<br/>\nrehearsal early (so fun!), and mastering online scrabble... <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, she&#39;s watching a video of Pippin that she&#39;s watched dozens of<br/>\ntimes, and she just paused it and rewound, and pointed out that Pippin&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;mail&quot; shirt is really knitted, on big needles... which she knows because<br/>\nI took up kniting, and then she decided to learned, too..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if you are depressed, I think getting that treated is the most<br/>\nimportant step you can take for your son&#39;s unschooling... and for your<br/>\nown happiness, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=freeformlife\">http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=freeformlife</a><br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103937,"nextTopicId":104155}}
