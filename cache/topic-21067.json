DoDDS (DoD Dependent Schools)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1414168978\">To the NHEN Board,<br/>\n<br/>\nDoDEA (Department of Defense Educational Authority) is the governing<br/>\nauthority for all DoD military schools.  DoDDS (DoD Dependent Schools)  is<br/>\nthe governing authority for DoD schools overseas, and they fall under the<br/>\nauthority of DoDEA (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/index.htm)\">http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/index.htm)</a>.<br/>\nUSAREUR (US Army Europe) is a separate command, and the lines of authority<br/>\nare separate.  Think of DoDEA as the Board of Education for the military,<br/>\nwhereas USAREUR is doing the *job* of the *army* in Europe.   They both<br/>\nreport up the chain (up to the Secretary of Defense), and they meet with each<br/>\nother formally, but neither one has authority over the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my understanding of what&#39;s happening.  If anyone has a different<br/>\nunderstanding, I would appreciate hearing about it so that we can resolve the<br/>\ndifferences and arrive at a correct understanding.  Also, if any of my<br/>\nterminology is incorrect, I would appreciate the correction.   I am basing my<br/>\nunderstanding on discussions I have had personally with people within DoDEA,<br/>\nweb research and contacts in Germany.  I am the homeschooling spouse of an<br/>\nAir Force officer.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoDEA is under pressure to develop policies allowing homeschoolers to receive<br/>\nservices from DoD schools.  HSLDA has been exerting this pressure via<br/>\ncongressional directives and, since the language in subsequent DoDEA policy<br/>\nletters was not satisfactory, and because they wanted a standardized policy,<br/>\nthey found sponsors to introduce HR830.  This forced DoDEA to begin<br/>\nconsidering the establishment of a home school task force, and the<br/>\ndiscussions of establishing such have taken place at meetings of the Defense<br/>\nEducation Council (DEC).  The Dependents Education Council includes<br/>\nDoDEA/DoDDS as well as command/regional/operational commanders (&quot;flag<br/>\nofficers&quot;), who, again, are in a separate chain of command from DoDEA.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least one regional commander, including USAREUR (General Jordan),<br/>\nreportedly has had isolated bad incidents occur at one or more of their<br/>\nbases, in which people claimed they were homeschooling, *or* they have base<br/>\ncommanders who are worrying along the lines of &quot;well, what if?.&quot;   Base<br/>\ncommanders are not typically any more savvy about or accepting of<br/>\nhomeschooling than your everyday Joe.  Thus, when the subject of providing<br/>\nDoD school services to homeschoolers was raised, their concerns were seen as<br/>\npotentially addressable, and the issue was raised &quot;how do we know they&#39;re<br/>\nreally educating their kids?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere exists a draft DEC report, which has yet to be approved by the DEC,<br/>\nwhich reportedly contains recommendations for the establishment and conduct<br/>\nof a home school task force to study homeschooling issues.  DoDEA personnel<br/>\nhave stressed to me that nothing has been approved yet, and that thus there<br/>\nis no direction from the DEC for any sort of task force meetings to be taking<br/>\nplace.  In fact, in a recent meeting, DoDEA asked the DEC members to hold off<br/>\non any such meetings.  However, DoDEA cannot direct the DEC members to act or<br/>\nnot act, as the DEC members are not under the authority of the DoDEA.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears that the questionnaires and school liaison meetings in Germany are<br/>\nbeing driven by USAREUR, as an initiative of their own, related to but not<br/>\ndirected by the possible DEC action.  The USAREUR commander who apparently is<br/>\ndriving this, is the Deputy Commanding General, HQ USAREUR, General Jordan<br/>\n(see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/htmlinks/cmdgrp.htm)\">http://www.hqusareur.army.mil/htmlinks/cmdgrp.htm)</a>.  Also, a Dr. Perez<br/>\nwho is listed in a set of minutes from the European Schools Council as the<br/>\nEducation Director for USAREUR<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)\">http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)</a> especially has been active<br/>\nat school liaison officer meetings with homeschoolers in Germany.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I can tell, the appropriate intended audience for a letter from<br/>\nNHEN is, then, at this time, Dr. Perez, and probably General Jordan, even<br/>\nthough the letter would go to the school liaison officers.  The school<br/>\nliaison officers, who are holding the focus group meetings, do not have<br/>\nauthority to work policy; they are (no offense) worker bees.  Perhaps<br/>\naddressing it to the school liaison officers and sending courtesy copies to<br/>\nDr. Perez and General Jordan (or to General Jordan&#39;s Chief of Staff) would be<br/>\nappropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, The European Schools Council - European military commands<br/>\n(including USAREUR) and DoDDS - evidently have established their own working<br/>\ngroup, independent of DoDEA.  &quot;ESC recommended establishing a working group<br/>\nwith DoDDS to develop a home schooling policy for the Theater. This policy<br/>\nwill be sent to OSD for possible implementation throughout DoD&quot; (September<br/>\n2000, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)\">http://www.eucom.mil/programs/deped/esc0900.pdf)</a>.   This should be<br/>\nfollowed up, and it may be appropriate to send a courtesy copy to Mr. David<br/>\nLabuhn, Chief of Staff, DoDDS-E (DoDDS Europe).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe DoDEA has no desire to get involved with regulating homeschoolers.<br/>\nTo my understanding, they don&#39;t see themselves having the authority to do so.<br/>\n  The regulations give them authority only within the military schools.  At<br/>\nleast one high-ranking DoDEA person has a close family member who has<br/>\nhomeschooled.  They are more concerned with their efforts to reform DoD<br/>\nschools, measuring progress with the NAEP, standardizing curriculum across<br/>\nthe board in order to address transition issues, etc.  It is not an<br/>\nenvironment in which homeschoolers should be making themselves an issue or a<br/>\ntarget.  They are being pressured by congressional directives to standardize<br/>\npolicy for services to homeschoolers.  I think it would be *wise* to start<br/>\nactively working against HR830 so that the pressure is taken *off* DoDEA.  I<br/>\nthink they&#39;d be glad not to have to go through this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is troubling to me that members of HEART of Germany (an HSLDA-affiliated<br/>\ngroup) apparently knew about the USAREUR efforts for weeks, and did not make<br/>\nthe information publicly known to the general homeschooling community.  I<br/>\nwish I knew who has been controlling the flow of this information.<br/>\nNevertheless, now that it&#39;s come out into the open, I&#39;m glad that NHEN is<br/>\nstepping forward to help make the entirety of the homeschooling community<br/>\nvisible to the military.  Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some background documentation and additional information which I&#39;ve<br/>\ncollected, which I will send in a separate email, after I&#39;ve made the<br/>\ncollection manageable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila Nugent<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hsmick@...\">hsmick@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRead articles from the current<br/>\nissue of Home Education Magazine:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe send a blank emailing to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Networking-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">HEM-Networking-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
