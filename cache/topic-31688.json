After all a child<br/>\nunschools exactly like that. He follows the path that leads to *his* goal.<br/>\nHe isn&#39;t seeking out a path that leads to someone&#39;s definition of &quot;Jimmy&#39;s<br/>\ngoal in life&quot;.

Good questions.  We still have a couple of <br/>\nissues we are working through at our house.  Bedtime and chores being <br/>\nconsistently a challenge for me.  That, to me, falls under the realm <br/>\nof non coercive parenting.<br/>\nUnschooling to me, is about the child controlling their own learning, <br/>\nand the parent not deeming certain things more valuable, or less <br/>\nworthy as a learning tool, or interests more or less worthy.<br/>\nBedtimes and chores are about controlling my own sanity!  These <br/>\nissues, for me, are about living in a house with 6 people and how we <br/>\nall get along.  It&#39;s not about my children choosing what they want <br/>\nout of life.<br/>\nI do have trouble with this one.  Though, I know in my heart, a non <br/>\ncoercive approach in all parts of life, is the ideal, I&#39;m not at this <br/>\npoint, capable of completely embracing it.
