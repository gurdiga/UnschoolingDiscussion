I would absolutely be too afraid to confront a loudly violent<br/>\nneighbor directly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Los Angeles, mecca of gangs. It is more than merely possible that<br/>\nthe violent neighbor might have a gun and/or be a gang member. It is<br/>\nactually pretty likely. Too likely to risk for me. <br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I spoke softly to my behind-my-house neighbor ( in the vacant lot of his <br/>\nside yard, our back yard==and then it turned to yelling) last year, I was <br/>\nafraid, but not shaky-afraid.  I was apprehensive that he might do something <br/>\nlater.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does help that I have a big scary husband.  I never have sicced him on <br/>\nanyone, but in terms of bullying males, if they see a bigger male with a brave <br/>\nwife, it&#39;s a deterrent.  But my husband wasn&#39;t home.   The guy didn&#39;t know that. <br/>\n But I was tired of hearing him and the mom yell at those kids all the time <br/>\nfor nothing, and hateful things.  Their kids were bullying Holly verbally.   So <br/>\nI was doing something for Holly, indirectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwice afterwards that I know of, the police were looking for that guy.  Once <br/>\nthey had the police helicopter over the neighborhood.  They didn&#39;t find him <br/>\neither time.  But there&#39;s been no yelling, no young boys, for many months, so <br/>\nsomething happened. There&#39;s a girl there with a baby sometimes.  Late teens, <br/>\nearly 20&#39;s.  I did feel bad for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I thought he had a gun while he was out trying to fly a kite with his kids <br/>\n(and calling them idiot and stupid because the kite wasn&#39;t going up), I <br/>\nmight&#39;ve acted differently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there can be another downside to reporting something.  My friend Cathyn <br/>\nand I were in a Village Inn on Central/66 one night and a very drunk couple <br/>\nwere the only  others in the big section, and he hit her (not very effectively, <br/>\nthey were SO drunk) and I saw it, and the two of us bailed out of our booth and <br/>\nCathyn saw him drag her out of the booth and gently got him away from  her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe manager called the police.   He should&#39;ve done something sooner. They had <br/>\nalready decided to ignore the couple, but they hadn&#39;t asked them to leave.  <br/>\nSo they were totally disturbing OUR visit.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI advised the couple to go on home (they lived walking distance) but they <br/>\nsaid no, they were going to eat.  The restaurant people said they weren&#39;t going <br/>\nto serve them.  I said if the police came they would have to deal with that, <br/>\nbut they should go home and sleep it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guy was scrawny and weak.  The woman was not even going to remember, she <br/>\nwas so drunk.  But they stayed.  The police took him in.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathyn and I were subpoenaed to court as witnesses.  He had to miss half a <br/>\nday of work.  I had to arrange for the kids (not too bad, as Holly was eight or <br/>\nnine by then).   The guy didn&#39;t show up, so they issued an arrest warrant and <br/>\nwe were subpoenaed again.  Cathyn had to miss another half day of work.  <br/>\nBecause I could identify the guy in the courtroom before court started, they let us <br/>\ngo home without testifying.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy cost was time, inconvenience and paying to park downtown.

My problem with talking to the parents is that it would only enrage them, risking a really nasty beating for the child as a result.  <br/>\n <br/>\nYes, offering any victim of abuse a place to stay means putting yourself, and your own family, at risk.  The most dangerous time in an abused woman&#39;s life is when she leaves her abuser, I have to think the same would be true for a child trying to escape.  Invite her into your home and you&#39;ve invited in the same danger.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally, I think everyone should feel an obligation to be a mandatory reporter.  The real problem is that, in some states (New Mexico, for example) parents can do abusive things to their child in the name of discipline, and even social services thinks it&#39;s okay.  As long as it&#39;s legal for parents to hit a child in any way, there will be levels of interpretation -- some workers and agencies won&#39;t have a problem with paddles, belts, etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m glad you called social services, Julie, and it&#39;s good to hear her boyfriend called the police.  No matter how this plays out, she needs counseling -- and real life models of good relationship skills --  because it&#39;s not uncommon for abused children to become abused wives (been there, lived that) or abusers themselves.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n****<br/>\n <br/>\nThe only problem with offering her a place to stay is that the parents would then know where to find her. A women&#39;s shelter, where the addresses are confidential might be a better place. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142002410,"authorName":"Kristi","from":"&quot;Kristi&quot; &lt;hayes@...&gt;","profile":"morgainesmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Child abuse","postDate":"1090065646","msgId":96312,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkYjRkZStoazEzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNkYW9wcSthcTByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96311,"nextInTopic":96314,"prevInTime":96311,"nextInTime":96313,"topicId":96258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone mentioned earlier about the girl being worried about the younger children.

I&#39;ll add from experience that when I was being <br/>\nabused, I understood also my mother&#39;s codependence w/my stepfather.  <br/>\nI rationalized that while I only had to live with it a few more <br/>\nyears, my mother couldn&#39;t live without a man, and had often chosen <br/>\nstanding up to him to standing up to me, like when I told her he was <br/>\nbeing sexually inappropriate w/me and she replied that he would <br/>\nnever do that.  I was not willing to &quot;wreck our home,&quot; knowing that <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t seem to abuse my brothers and that my mother did not want <br/>\nto be without him.  So I stuck it out.  When I finally tried to <br/>\ncommit suicide, my stepfather didn&#39;twant me in counselling.  So I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I really wish one of my friends had talked to their <br/>\nparents about what was happening and that an adult had stepped in.  <br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m glad noone stepped in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also feared being in an unknown situation.  Sometimes the evil you <br/>\nknow is easier than the evil you don&#39;t.  Furthermore, most abuse is <br/>\nabout power.  When someone holds power over you it is hard to look <br/>\npast that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t give you advice, Julie.  But I can tell you: I survived ... <br/>\nI survived being beaten, I survived a suicide attempt, I survived <br/>\nsexual inappropriateness and even found the strength to say &quot;no&quot; <br/>\nwhen it began to evolve into something far worse.  In many ways I&#39;m <br/>\na stronger person and a better mom because of it.  In some ways <br/>\nnot.  Lots of people are abused in far worse ways than I was.  Lots <br/>\nof them survive, too.  Some don&#39;t.  Or some survive and go on to be <br/>\nself-destructive.  I was fortunate when I was 19 to have a friend <br/>\nrecognize that I was suicidal and help me get counselling.  That <br/>\nhelped me take back the power I&#39;d lost and break out of a cycle of <br/>\nbeing involved in abuseive relationships.  I feel fortunate I had a <br/>\nfriend who saw it and got it; sometimes I wonder what would have <br/>\nhappened if she hadn&#39;t intervened.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI called CPS once because of a large buildup of neglect with a child <br/>\nI cared for.  Sometimes I&#39;m sorry I called, as they looked in, <br/>\nnothing happened, and things did not get at all better and probably <br/>\nwere a bit worse for a while.

I would absolutely be too afraid to confront a loudly violent<br/>\nneighbor directly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Los Angeles, mecca of gangs. It is more than merely possible that<br/>\nthe violent neighbor might have a gun and/or be a gang member. It is<br/>\nactually pretty likely. Too likely to risk for me. We call the local station<br/>\n(not 911) for loud shouting at night, gunfire or scary odd lurkers in the<br/>\nalley. We have done it four or five times in the last seven years that we<br/>\nhave lived here. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly the gang and drug activity in my *immediate* neighborhood is<br/>\nfairly low. However the signs, such as graffiti, are increasing, and the<br/>\nheart of it is within just a few miles. No shoes on the power lines yet, at<br/>\nleast. A woman in my local group had a drive-by shooting directly outside<br/>\nher front gate last year, in an area considered &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;family<br/>\nfriendly&quot;. The shrine was there for months.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe drug dealers down the street seemed to have moved, possibly after a few<br/>\nof the locals (including dh) complained - to the police in patrolling squad<br/>\ncars - about the endless stream of vehicles parking illegally in the alley<br/>\nat all hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of the reason there is a strongish<br/>\npolice presence in our area is the Airport - we get LAPD *and* Airport<br/>\nPolice, and occasionally Bomb Squad, driving by. That and an ongoing attempt<br/>\nto deter the street racers who love the Parkway. Huge increases in this<br/>\nafter that movie and its sequel came out. Only one small floral shrine that<br/>\nhas been kept up and renewed for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlucky criminal story: A man tried to mug at gunpoint another guy at the<br/>\nend of our street, by the high school, last year sometime as I recall.<br/>\nUnfortunately for the mugger he chose an off duty FBI agent, and ended up<br/>\nshot dead for his trouble. No shrine in this case. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we were dating, James and I were on our way to meet up with some<br/>\ncolleagues after work. It was in Hollywood, not a spectacularly safe city,<br/>\nbut we had parked to walk only one block to the main road. We were mugged at<br/>\ngunpoint by two well-spoken polite young men. One had a revolver and the<br/>\nother some kind of automatic pistol. When they told us to walk away, I<br/>\nthought I was going to die, but fortunately they just ran off in the other<br/>\ndirection with my bag and his wallet. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn early morning jogger found my bag the next day, and called me. They had<br/>\nleft my credit cards, but taken my cash, the nasty sweaty shorts I had been<br/>\nwearing at work earlier (creepy), and pager. For several months, when I had<br/>\nreplaced the pager, I received a lot of odd pages from people confused by me<br/>\nreturning their page. I passed each of these numbers on to the detective in<br/>\ncharge of this case. Evidently they were drug customers looking for their<br/>\ndealer. This was before the universality of cel phones.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

However, what it does do <br/>\nis stop the violence NOW and many times that can prevent hospitalization, emergency <br/>\nroom visits or worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s visit probably worked well because it was after the fact.  You can&#39;t reason with <br/>\nthese people in the middle of their rages.

Strangers are going to be harder to &quot;trust&quot; when <br/>\nyou haven&#39;t learned trust in one&#39;s own family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue also may be fear for the younger children.

Counseling has helped me too. Is any <br/>\nsort of counseling available from someone who as also experienced <br/>\nthis type of abuse?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe internet is easier to &quot;trust&quot; than people who might end up <br/>\nhurting you. Perhaps you could find some useful sites for her to read <br/>\naccording to her age.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce she KNOWS she doesn&#39;t deserve to be treated this way, she can <br/>\nchoose to change the situation.
