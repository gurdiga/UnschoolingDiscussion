It&#39;s traditionally made on All Saints Day or<br/>\nHalloween and some families would leave out a plate of it, with a<br/>\nlump of butter in the center for the fairies and the ghosts. There is<br/>\neven a traditional Irish song that was written long ago about<br/>\ncolcannon that you can sing while preparing it!<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you ever eat colcannon<br/>\nWhen &#39;twas made with yellow cream<br/>\nAnd the kale and praties blended<br/>\nLike the picture in a dream?<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you ever take a forkful<br/>\nAnd dip it in the lake<br/>\nOf heather-flavored butter<br/>\nThat your mother used to make?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, you did, yes you did!<br/>\nSo did he and so did I,<br/>\nAnd the more I think about it<br/>\nSure, the more I want to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod be with the happy times<br/>\nWhen trouble we had not,<br/>\nAnd our mothers made Colcannon<br/>\nIn the little three-legged pot.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The little pot was known as a Bastable oven, which looked a<br/>\nlittle like a cauldron with a lid that was put over a fire and used<br/>\nas an oven to bake bread and other dishes. )<br/>\n<br/>\nTraditional charms were put in the colcannon that symbolized<br/>\ndifferent things. A button meant you would remain a bachelor<br/>\nand a thimble meant you would remain a spinster for the coming<br/>\nyear. A ring meant you would get married and a coin meant<br/>\nyou would come into wealth. Gather the family together and make<br/>\nthis simple, but fun recipe for dinner!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Colcannon Recipe<br/>\nIngredients:<br/>\n1 pound cabbage<br/>\n2 pounds russet or yukon gold potatoes<br/>\n2 small leeks, green onions or scallions<br/>\n1 cup milk<br/>\nSalt and pepper, to taste<br/>\n1/2 cup (1 stick) plus 2 tablespoons butter<br/>\ndash of nutmeg or mace<br/>\n<br/>\nCore, quarter and shred the cabbage and place in a pan, covering<br/>\nwith boiled salted water til tender-about 15 minutes. Peel and cut<br/>\nthe potatoes into 2 inch pieces and cook those too in salted water<br/>\nfor about 15 minutes in another pan. (Assign duties to different family<br/>\nmembers!) Drain the cabbage and chop into very small pieces. Drain<br/>\nthe potatoes and mash by hand. Do not use a processor or mixer!<br/>\nMeanwhile, wash and chop the onion-use what is available to you,<br/>\nusing the middle parts-not the root end or rough ends of the green<br/>\npart. In a pan large enough to hold the cooked potatoes and cabbage,<br/>\ncombine the onions and milk and cook over medium heat until they<br/>\nare tender, about 8 to10 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd the potatoes, salt, pepper, and mace to the onions and milk and<br/>\nstir over low heat until well-blended. Add the cabbage and 1/2 cup of<br/>\nbutter and stir again to the consistency of mashed potatoes. Mound<br/>\nthe mixture in the middle of a platter and make an indentation. Add<br/>\nthe remainder of the butter.  Serves 4 to 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nMORE IRISH FUN:<br/>\nWhy shamrocks?
