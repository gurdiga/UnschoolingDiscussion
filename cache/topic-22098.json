Only make one or<br/>\nfour blocks and strip piece the rest of it by machine.<br/>\nLike a giant log cabin.  Then machine quilt only the<br/>\ncorners and tie the middle.  That way he can finish it<br/>\nin one summer, won&#39;t take over your sewing area all of<br/>\nthe time, and learns lots of techniques as well as<br/>\nmostly creates it himself.  If he begins to loose<br/>\ninterest, make the strips wider and tie the whole<br/>\nthing. Use the thickest batting you can find for<br/>\ntieing, then it is more comforter like, and any<br/>\n&quot;mistakes&quot; (like gathered seams) don&#39;t really show up.<br/>\nThey usually look like part of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun.......let HIM choose his colors.

I made my first quilt 21 years ago when I <br/>\nwas expecting child #1 since then I&#39;ve made mostly baby quilts and have <br/>\ngiven most of those away - unless they were for child #2 & 3!!  In the past <br/>\ncouple of years I found a list for quilters, got involved in that and the <br/>\nnext thing I knew I was making more and more quilts.  In the past 2 years <br/>\nI&#39;ve put together 4 charity quilts and an almost full size quilt for my dd <br/>\nfor her very blahhhh dorm room and I&#39;m in the process of handquilting an <br/>\nAmish style quilt for ds #1.  Should have that finished in a couple of <br/>\nmonths!<br/>\n<br/>\nTerri, I found your comments about the quilt guild your MIL attends very <br/>\ninteresting.  I just starting attending a local guild and most everyone <br/>\nthere machine quilts.... they just put together so many tops that there <br/>\nisn&#39;t enough time to hand quilt them.  In fact at least 2 of the members are <br/>\nprofessional long-arm machine quilters.  I guess they&#39;d never fit in with <br/>\nyour MIL&#39;s group!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think they both have a place.  Machine quilting is beautiful, <br/>\naccepted by the judges at most shows and is quick!  Hand quilting has <br/>\nhistory and there are some quilts that just &quot;need&quot; to be hand quilted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love all kinds of designs, too.  Like I said the one I&#39;m making right now <br/>\nis a traditional style design.  The one I made for ds was a little newer, <br/>\ngeometric design.  And then I have the Maple Leaf blocks calling my name in <br/>\nmy sewing room - they seem to want me to put them together into one quilt!  <br/>\nLOL!!  And the ones I&#39;ve been enjoying lately are the watercolor designs.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried a block-of the month of one of those and just loved the look!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now it&#39;s my turn to apologize.  I got a little carried away, but this <br/>\nis my passion - next to my kids and I can spend hours playing with fabric!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, ds #2 (13 yo) wants to make a quilt this summer.  I love the idea <br/>\nbut have wayyyyyy too many patterns to choose from.  I don&#39;t want him to get <br/>\nbored by doing the same pattern over and over but I want it to be fairly <br/>\nquick - something we can actually complete this summer!!  Any <br/>\nsuggestions????<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a ton! of novelty prints and was thinking of an I Spy type of quilt, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t know if I have enough patterns he&#39;d enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA for the ideas!<br/>\nJeanmarie<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"&quot;Betsy Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"wzr5T8Wxyv1iXVWNV-EE6geU7WFNBgLkQe5xaCs15OSBRx9SacNS1-bWtcfHXRRJJkFB6uIapxCGPm-TOIRv2DHL2ztVFPKkRpe0emQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Quilting - was Apology","postDate":"991101068","msgId":22107,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3Mzg0MDkxLUVEMTRDQDIwOS4xNzkuMjUxLjExND4="},"prevInTopic":22098,"nextInTopic":22163,"prevInTime":22106,"nextInTime":22108,"topicId":22098,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
