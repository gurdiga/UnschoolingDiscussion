I read but ignore all posts which I would classify as negative. There are still plenty of other coversations going on that are beneficial without the bickering. I&#39;ve been learning a lot. I&#39;m also on the other list.

I hope you stay, DB, and don&#39;t get scared off by a little nastiness. IMO, it doesn&#39;t mean anything.
