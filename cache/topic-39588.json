It <br/>\nis ALL he wants to do. When there&#39;s no one around to pitch-and-catch with, <br/>\nhe sits on the front porch and mopes. In his precious, ragged baseball cap.  <br/>\nBaseball just ended -- and he wants to know when sigh-ups start. Of course, <br/>\nbaseball is full of statistics... a great way to learn percentages and <br/>\nfractions!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a small problem. My 5 yo thinks he&#39;s much bigger than he is. He <br/>\nthinks he&#39;s 9, basically, like his big brother. THe trouble with that is <br/>\nthat he looks down on anyone his age. There is a  a little boy down the <br/>\nstreet and my 5yo won&#39;t play with him because this kid, who is his age, is a <br/>\n  &quot;stupid wussy baby.&quot; The little boy is admittedly bossy (a very verbal <br/>\nonly child) but I think it&#39;s wrong for my 5yo to be so mean to him-- , if <br/>\nthe little boy shows up at our door, my son runs off, locks a door, and <br/>\ncalls the little boy a baby or a &quot;wussy boy&quot; until the other kid leaves in <br/>\ntears. I don&#39;t care if they play together or not, actually. I just don&#39;t <br/>\nwant my llittle guy to be a bully. When I try to reason with him -- ie, &quot;how <br/>\nwould you feel if someone called you names?&quot; -- he responds by saying, &quot;But <br/>\nMom! William IS a wussy boy!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;s getting this from his brother and his brother&#39;s friends, and <br/>\nreally fixated on it! Has anyone had a problem with their child being mean <br/>\nto some other kid, and what do you do??<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39586,"nextTopicId":39592}}
