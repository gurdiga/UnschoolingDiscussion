Casey and I actually changed rooms for her last week.

We accomplished most of it <br/>\nwithin 2 days too and on much less than a 500 pound budget. We painted the <br/>\nnew room purple, made curtains and pillows, put a bead trim around an old <br/>\nlight shade, organized, sorted and (like you said so wonderfully) remembered <br/>\nour way through her stuff.
