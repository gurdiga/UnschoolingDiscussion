If a nationwide curriculum was strongly enforced<br/>\nit could have a narrowing effect on the diversity of ideas found in the<br/>\nAmerican population.  Just like plants need to be diverse and evolving<br/>\nto create a healthy ecosystem, ideas need to flourish individually and<br/>\ndifferently, not be &quot;planted&quot; in a &quot;monoculture&quot; consisting of a single<br/>\ntruth that is the right answer on the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf everyone always believed the same &quot;party line&quot; about everything, how<br/>\nwould the knowledge base ever expand and change.  I think there needs to<br/>\nbe conflict and competition and destruction for ideas to grow and improve.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomogenized ideas fed alike into all young citizens is a scary idea to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45073,"authorName":"amycats2@aol.com","from":"amycats2@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re Core Knowledge","postDate":"1052592232","msgId":68481,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2YS4xZTcwZjI4Ny4yYmVlYTI2OEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68517,"prevInTime":68480,"nextInTime":68482,"topicId":68481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/9/2003 8:38:53 AM Central Daylight Time, ...
