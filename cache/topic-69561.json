Looked at the lego site a bit but so slow loading  that  I will have to go back another time. We have a dial up server. Our rural phone lines wont support Telus and no cable of course. Kids sites are always very slow  for us-computer needs  to go in for scrubbing  as well. Will see if the lego magazine goes out to Canada.<br/>\nWe do  some &quot;playing &quot; with them-my husband  will sit and put things together if that what they want. I usually listen a bit  and if they make something I might say-oh that looks like it might be a neat hut for Hagrid. <br/>\nAnyway-yes the girls  have huge  &quot;do not touch&quot; setups for their animals and &quot;barbies&quot;  and  they can get in a real uproar if someone comes over and trashes things-they have a cousin their  age who can be very like  Syd in Toy Story 1. yikes-:0(<br/>\nThursday evening the  theme line was &quot;school in the olden days&quot; because their Brownie troup walked to our little local museum and the  guide showed them the old school house complete with STRAP-that really blew them away-they had to hear all  about the times  that I got the strap as a kid-Grandpa never did get the strap. ??? guess  I  started bucking authority early-thats what mine were all about. <br/>\ngrace<br/>\n{Miss Frizzle says &quot;Take Chances-Get Messy-Make Mistakes&quot;}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69293,"nextTopicId":69502}}
