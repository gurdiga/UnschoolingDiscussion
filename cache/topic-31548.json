The concern was over letting<br/>\nideas that were counter to unschooling philosophy pass by unexamined.<br/>\nPerhaps some can&#39;t imagine those ideas being examined without being blunt.<br/>\nBut they can if phrased carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that the list has felt &quot;kinder and gentler&quot; recently *solely*<br/>\nbecause people have been more attentive to how they respond. (Though I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s a factor.) I think that there just hasn&#39;t been anything posted that<br/>\nrose above people&#39;s comfort level. (Until the past few days of course!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have a higher comfort level than others. Ren&#39;s was at the level<br/>\nof the concept of being behind. (Whether that was what the poster meant or<br/>\nnot is irrelevant if Ren was certain she understood because if it *was*<br/>\ntrue, she would still have asked the question.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really think -- even banning the &quot;blunt&quot; folk from posting -- that<br/>\nthe newly reformed kinder, gentler folk would have been uniformly kind and<br/>\ngentle if someone had said she had to spank because she knew her kids would<br/>\nrun wild if she didn&#39;t? I don&#39;t think so because I think that idea exceeds<br/>\nthe comfort level of most of the posters here. And the more it exceeds it,<br/>\nthe more &quot;not gentle&quot; their response would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a function of comfort level.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *also* a function of the style of people&#39;s posts. No one can control<br/>\nthat, though Mary and Cindy can send out reminders and talk to people.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some people *are* just looking for support and &quot;good job&quot; pats on  the back<br/>\n&gt; for how far they&#39;re progressing.

I was describing what *some* people come to<br/>\nunschooling.com to find. I said in the sentence *right before* the one you<br/>\npulled out to quote: &quot;Even this list where parenting and unschooling ideas<br/>\nare examined isn&#39;t for everyone.&quot; I said it right there that people here<br/>\nwere questioning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe a lot further than if she was blasted away the minute she arrived and<br/>\n&gt; feeling wounded. Look at the number of people who leave because of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I *do* see people leaving because they felt attacked a problem. I&#39;m sad<br/>\nevery time that happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n*But* I also suspect it&#39;s because unschooling is on the edge of people&#39;s<br/>\ncomfort level. For people who aren&#39;t there yet, it *does* take<br/>\nself-examination to get it because society has filled us full of unexamined<br/>\n&quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;musts&quot;. There isn&#39;t anyway to shed those that isn&#39;t<br/>\nuncomfortable. (It doesn&#39;t mean it must be painful, but it won&#39;t be a<br/>\nparty.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a forum where someone can be supported for doing the best they can and<br/>\nexpecting their (nonunschooling) solutions to problems to be received<br/>\nwithout comment *can&#39;t* be a forum about unschooling. It might be a nice,<br/>\ngentle, supportive place! But it *wouldn&#39;t* be unschooling. People don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to be attacked because they suggest Saxon as a good way to do math, but<br/>\n*if* they expect to be able to suggest it without it being commented on<br/>\nbecause &quot;whatever works for your family is best&quot;, then they aren&#39;t going to<br/>\nfeel comfortable in an *unschooling* forum. They need a &quot;whatever works best<br/>\nfor you family&quot; homeschooling forum! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I mean, seriously... this is a big list of over 600 people. LOOK at how many<br/>\n&gt; post on a regular basis. WHERE are all the other 500 or so???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From what others have said, that isn&#39;t unusual. Most lists, even the gentle<br/>\nlists, have more readers than participants. Maybe it&#39;s a school thing<br/>\nbecause most people feel more confident in their ability to read than in<br/>\ntheir ability to write.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Subjects of substance WAS: new and in\tneed of support","postDate":"1012163229","msgId":31660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4NzlDNTkzLjQ3REYlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDBlZTYzNDM0NjE4MWIxMkZFNkBNYWlsNi50cmlhZC5yci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31658,"nextInTopic":31661,"prevInTime":31659,"nextInTime":31661,"topicId":31548,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *Please* Sarah.

About understanding, I think I needed a very strong wake up call kind of message, very blunt and to the point, and that is what you get at unschooling.com a lot of the time. I have since come to really value this bluntness because unschooling was spelled out so clearly for me. I was convinced of what I needed to do and started almost immediately when it became clear to me. BTW, for all the bluntness at unschooling.com, there are many, many people there who all have their own unique styles of posting which come across friendlier, respectful and that treat the poster as a human being. Whenever I post, that is how I try to be. But sometimes a poster comes along and asks the most ridiculous questions relating to unschooling and I don&#39;t even have a clue how to answer so I don&#39;t even try.

Although I really agreed with his philosophy I never made the connection to try unschooling, or maybe never had the courage back then. No, his books where not enough to make me realize I should try this in my house. Mabye I was naive and insecure back then. I really appreciate the unschooling support I have found online and I don&#39;t know if I could have started unschooling without it.
