Obviously, it&#39;s best if the whole family can go, but if you can at <br/>\nall manage to do it, you should come, even if it means just you and the <br/>\nbaby being there.  You will get sooooo much out of it that the benefits far <br/>\noutweigh the bummerness of leaving your son and husband home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I say this is that most of us do not live in unschooling <br/>\ncommunities, and it can be really tough to do something that is as fringe <br/>\nas unschooling when you&#39;re the only one in your area doing it.  Okay, well, <br/>\nit may not be tough to *do* it, but it can be tough to deal with the doubts <br/>\nand concerns and all that when you are feeling like an oddball.  But at the <br/>\nconference, you are in a community and you are not on the fringe!  You&#39;ll <br/>\nbe able to bring that sense of community home with you and it will benefit <br/>\nyou long after the conference has ended.  You&#39;ll have a sense of <br/>\ncomradeship that you didn&#39;t have before, and you&#39;ll be able to see living, <br/>\nbreathing, functioning unschooling families comprised of younger children <br/>\nand older children, treating each other with respect and joy.  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nhow it is where you live, but that kind of thing is pretty rare in my neck <br/>\nof the woods.  Being in the midst of so many unschoolers really helped me <br/>\nto feel a kinship with people whom I had never even met, and helped me see <br/>\nwhat this whole thing can really look like.  It helped me believe in myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, no, Kelly Lovejoy is not paying me!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you have the support of your husband, I hope you will <br/>\nreconsider.

I can only imagine how much energy it has taken for you to <br/>\ndo this, and when you are able to redirect and dedicate *that* energy to <br/>\nyour home and farm, I&#39;d bet it&#39;s going to be a knockout!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;d truly recommend coming THIS year.
