Did this person mean <br/>\nto suggest that the only things we learn from are people and books?  &quot;<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nWhat about atmosphere?  A stimulating atmosphere vs. a sterile boring atmosphere has to change a person.  A kid who grows up in a house where he can&#39;t touch anything and it just feels stuffy and stifling would probably have a different outlook on the world than he would have if he had grown up in a stimulating house where he had freedom to create and make messes.  And a person who goes from having her own house to be institutionalized is sometimes changed so much that they give up and die (I&#39;m thinking old people who want to remain in their home but are forced into nursing homes).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that takes us right back to your theory (or early idea &lt;g&gt;) again.  Because atmosphere affects how you learn.  It also affects emotions though too.  A little old lady happy and content in her home can become despondent when she has to leave it...is it because she can&#39;t learn and think the way she wants to in the institution?  Maybe! <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s love and shame and acceptance and fear and other emotions.  Someone could learn a lot academically even though she&#39;s made fun of or ignored by most of the people around her.  A kid who&#39;s abused at home and never learned to be herself and is withdrawn so much into a shell that the other kids make fun of her and so she just throws herself into academic work in school because it&#39;s all she has.  She&#39;s learning, but not learning the same things she would have learned if she had been loved and accepted and free to be herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Someone asked what non-spiritual explanation/term for changes after illness <br/>\nmight be, and I think maybe it&#39;s that adversity brings on different <br/>\nbiochemistry, and new neural pathways (and emotional &quot;sets&quot;) are created during <br/>\nadversity.  We learn to cope.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie What the Bleep Do we Know hit on that a little bit. It talked about how the chemical patterns in our brain affect everything about us, and how we can consciously change the chemical patterns in our brain to create what we want to see in our lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, so I think movies could be added to the list!   <br/>\nI have heard people say that What the Bleep  was life changing.  Several people on other lists said that they actually think they&#39;ll be able to break addictions because of watching the movie. <br/>\n I watched the movie and enjoyed it, but I really got the most insight from it when talking to my husband and friend about it.  (That&#39;s an interesting thing I&#39;m learning about myself...I always thought of myself as such an introvert, yet I&#39;m realizing as I&#39;ve been reflecting on this thread that I really do learn and change the most when I discuss ideas with other people. )  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember as a kid our church would show those end time movies.  Anyone else from a conservative Christian background remember them?  Thief in the night, Mark of the Beast, Distant thunder (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amfchristianvideos.com/Thief_Night.htm)\">http://www.amfchristianvideos.com/Thief_Night.htm)</a>.  LOTS of people &quot;went forward&quot; to commit their lives to Christ after those movies.  Lots of little kids (including me!) had nightmares after those movies.  So there&#39;s another example of life-changing (maybe in a not so positive way, imo) movie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] book worship, and if not then what?","postDate":"1115563112","msgId":105909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlNi4zYjUwZmFjYi4yZmFmN2U2OEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105907,"nextInTopic":105910,"prevInTime":105908,"nextInTime":105910,"topicId":105874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had ideas, but wanted to see what others thought too.

Plain <br/>\nand simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I&#39;m going to suggest a book. ;) Seriously, an <br/>\ninteresting and compelling argument (as I see it) for the importance of <br/>\nprint can be found in Partha Chatterjee&#39;s book _Imagined Communities_. <br/>\nIn it, he tracks the rise of the vernacular (English taking over in <br/>\nprint from Greek and Latin) as it coincides with the rise of <br/>\nnationalism--the American and French Revolutions and all the smaller <br/>\nnational revolutions in Europe and South America that took them as a <br/>\nmodel. His argument is that as the vernacular became available in print <br/>\n(newspapers grew astoundingly in this period) and literacy rates rose <br/>\nbecause people could read stuff in their own language, a broader <br/>\ncommunity that spanned geographical space and time became possible. A <br/>\ncolonist in America, the Virgin Islands or South America could read the <br/>\nsame newspaper as the citizen in the mother county, creating an imagined <br/>\nsense of simultaneous community and connection with those far away in <br/>\nspace and time (could take weeks for the newspapers to arrive to the <br/>\ncolonies). His argument is that this print culture made nationalism as <br/>\nwe know it possible--prior to that religion (think crusades) was the <br/>\norganizing principle. He traces this phenomenon through several <br/>\ncountries, looking at the importance of coffee houses during the <br/>\nRevolutionary period, the importance of papers and pamphlets, the rise <br/>\nof secret societies and the papers associated with them, that kind of <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an interesting argument for the importance of print culture in <br/>\nEnglish even though &quot;the novel&quot; was denigrated in its early development, <br/>\nthough I have my own arguments as to the purpose novels served during <br/>\nthe formation of modern nationalism.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (7), Julia (6), Sam (4.5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: book worship, and if not then what?","postDate":"1115501394","msgId":105903,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1amMwaSs1ODE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkNy4zYzE2M2RlOC4yZmFlNDIxZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105899,"nextInTopic":105905,"prevInTime":105902,"nextInTime":105904,"topicId":105874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... felt ... prepared ... small beach in ... there too ... did have. ... movie could ve ...

The person <br/>\nstating that &#39;only people and books change you&#39; might argue that it <br/>\nis the actual book format that helps create change.

Yeah, I guess both books and people have shaped me as a person<br/>\n(as have pop tarts and cheeseburgers :-)) but so have other things.  Here<br/>\nare some:<br/>\n<br/>\n***As a college student, I spent 6 months in Germany.  I backpacked around<br/>\nEurope, spent Christmas in Paris, and did the usual student stuff.  When I<br/>\ngot back to the states, I felt like I could do anything.  I had not felt<br/>\nthat way before.  I did read books and interact with people in Europe, but<br/>\nthose are not what made me feel invincible.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Before my oldest child was born, I lost two babies.  My first was<br/>\nstillborn at 39 weeks.  I miscarried my second 5 months later at 9 weeks.<br/>\nThat changed me.  Yes, these babies were people, but I didn�t �hang out�<br/>\nwith them in the sense that the freecycle poster meant.  The experience<br/>\nchanged me.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Living in Japan as a military family member has changed me.  Not because<br/>\nI hang out with military or non-military people, but since we don�t live on<br/>\nthe base, my day-to-day life is lived in Japanese society.  Since I speak<br/>\nonly minimal Japanese and don�t read it at all, I�m living as a functional<br/>\nilliterate here.  I�ve definitely changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay�my brain is stormed out.  Thanks for the mental exercise!<br/>\n<br/>\nTami<br/>\n(who struggles with trying to learn the 2 phonetic alphabets in Japanese and<br/>\nso far can recognize the words for �beer� and �baseball�  Go figure! :-)).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 07, 2005 5:58 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] book worship, and if not then what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis came in the e-mail from someone on our local freecycle list:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I&#39;m looking to add to my book collection!  afterall, the only thing<br/>\nthat changes you are the people you hang out with and the books you<br/>\nread!!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote back:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Even though I disagree with your quote, I might be willing to give you<br/>\nsome books!&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n-=-  What are your interests?<br/>\n-=-  Sandra-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt struck me as evidence of book worship, something I&#39;m tracking down in my<br/>\nspare time.

I think my changes came from a combination of: <br/>\n<br/>\n-talking things through with my husband<br/>\n-being online and reading stuff people were saying about different philosophies and ideas<br/>\n-coming to this list specifically, and having people like you (Sandra) and others being able to take my arguing (at first) and my insecure questioning later and come back at me with REALLY good blunt, to the point, mindful, honest, helpful, insightful  answers.  <br/>\n-talking things through with my homeopath<br/>\n-I guess I should give myself a bit of credit for being willing to at least think about things that might cause me to change. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband came first...he helped me be open minded enough to even consider the stuff I was reading here.  Then I came here and showed him stuff and helped him be open minded about different stuff.  Then my homeopath helped me even further after that...without the progress I made here and research about alternative healthcare that I did online the homeopath wouldn&#39;t have gotten anywhere with me <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess the answer for me is people.  But not just the hanging out with friends locally kind of people interaction.  The &quot;getting on the internet and deeply discussing issues with people you never would have met without the internet&quot; kind of talking to people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBooks were fun too, but mostly they were affirmations of what I already had acknowledged and understood from talking to people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: book worship, and if not then what?","postDate":"1115413814","msgId":105875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1Z21mbSt0NjVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkYS4zYmE1NWI4My4yZmFkMzQ2NEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":105874,"nextInTopic":105876,"prevInTime":105874,"nextInTime":105876,"topicId":105874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
