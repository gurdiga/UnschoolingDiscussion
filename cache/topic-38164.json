What I have noticed with some of the children that I know who<br/>\nhave been diagnosed with ADD is the family life is so structured and too<br/>\nmuch is happening in the childs life. ie/ school, afterschool sports 3<br/>\nnights a week and on Saturday plus their parents busy social life. When does<br/>\nthe child ever get the chance to take a breather and to organise their<br/>\nthought processes - a classic case of the hurried child syndrome for some of<br/>\nthese children.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also found with one family that their home life has become explosive and<br/>\nthey would comment on how well their boy would do with me and how calm he<br/>\nwould be - All I did was stop and listen to him and join in on activities<br/>\nwith him ie/ experiments he would do. I would video tape them and make a<br/>\ncommentry on them. This experiement was the same one that his mother said no<br/>\nto immediately and that it was dangerous - I said that I could look into it<br/>\nfor her and him and she said fine you can do it with him and we had a<br/>\npleasant afternoon - no hassles whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand that this boy is more intensive then most children and<br/>\nliving with him fulltime would be a challenge but I don&#39;t see the family<br/>\nmaking any adjustments to suit his special needs. I think that person (sorry<br/>\nforget who it was) did a wonderful thing for his nephews taking them on<br/>\nholiday with them and his intentions came from a very good and loving place<br/>\n(excluding the stopping of medication - not for or against just not educated<br/>\nin that area to comment) but I  wonder if half the children diagnosed with<br/>\nADD are just reacting to an environment that they do not want/appreciate/or<br/>\nneed to be different for what ever reasons but to force them to remain in<br/>\nthat environment is harmful to them in a number of ways!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSue<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:staclarspr@...\">staclarspr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 06, 2002 1:23 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] clear up a ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yes, I agree with many here who say Ritalin is overprescribed and that ADD<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t apply in an unschooling life.
