It gives a wonderful intro and overview <br/>\nto homeschooling and covers all of the different approaches.  It <br/>\nlists lots of resources too.  It&#39;s a very easy read packed with <br/>\ninformation.  She also wrote _The Unschooling Handbook_ which I love.<br/>\nYou mentioned the Teenage Liberation Handbook which is great for <br/>\nteens and their parents.  Grace Llewellyn also wrote _Real Lives_ or <br/>\nactually the kids wrote it themselves.  It&#39;s a collection of essays <br/>\nabout how 11 different teenage unschoolers spend their days - really <br/>\ninteresting and very reassuring.  Or how about a subscription to Home <br/>\nEd Magazine or GWS.  Those were my very first intros to <br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry,  I don&#39;t know what essay you were referring to.  Hopefully <br/>\nsomeone else will.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2947,"nextTopicId":2952}}
