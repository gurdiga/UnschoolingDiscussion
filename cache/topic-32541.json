My son Andrew who just turned 10 yesterday was still <br/>\nnot reading as of January of 2002. He is a VERY smart child and we <br/>\njust couldn&#39;t understand why he wasn&#39;t reading. SOOO we started <br/>\ngetting him tested to find out why. Well, first they did an IQ test <br/>\nand he scored a total score of 141. By his IQ he should have been <br/>\nreading. lol Well, after days and days of testing they told us he was <br/>\ndyslexic. We have worked with him here at home etc.. and it was still <br/>\nnot doing that much good. However, a few months ago, Andrew <br/>\ndiscovered a book called Junie B. Jones is a Party Animal.
