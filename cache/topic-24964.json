I think I <br/>\nwould say something like &quot;Do you know about homeschooling?  We really love <br/>\nit. &quot;  Then follow up with more info if there was any interest.  In a way <br/>\nthat reassures the parent that there are several other options without <br/>\nfinding fault with the parent -- and probably just making them defensive <br/>\nanyway.  I would try to offer hope and encouragement without a pinch of <br/>\njudgement and superiority.  Some folks think they have found the answer -- <br/>\nthat&#39;s terrific.  But it&#39;s not the answer for everyone.  The only &quot;answer&quot; <br/>\nfor everyone, imo, is to figure it out for yourself, one situation, one <br/>\nfamily, one child at a time.  The only &quot;movement&quot; I hope to see developing is <br/>\none where every parent knows what all their choices are and feels confident <br/>\nenough to make a conscious decision.

As though it were a cult where<br/>\nthe goal is to follow some nonsensical rules to reach nirvana ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst there&#39;s the certainty -- from observation, personal experience,<br/>\nreading and thought and discussion, at least to our satisfaction -- that<br/>\ngiven a rich, nurturing, real environment free from coerced learning we<br/>\ntrust that kids will grow in the direction that suits them best.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, perhaps the first sticking point for people understanding why<br/>\nunschoolers defend the unschooling process is that unschoolers have<br/>\ndifferent goals for their kids than the average parent and the second<br/>\nsticking point is we&#39;re certain that the standard way of thinking about<br/>\nlearning will interfer with those goals. It&#39;s more on the order of trusting<br/>\nthat nurturing kids interests to the fullest extent -- if immersed in the<br/>\nprocess of living (like food shopping and bill paying and voting and so<br/>\nforth) -- will allow kids to absorb what they need for life and grow into<br/>\nwho they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe average parent thinks of learning more in terms of feeding their kids&#39;<br/>\ncapabilities. They want to make sure the kids have a solid foundation to<br/>\nbegin building whatever the kids want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, like most foundations, the kids are limited to what they&#39;ve been handed<br/>\nand unfortunately aren&#39;t given the skills to expand or start over from<br/>\nscratch. On the other hand, the unschooled kids will have a foundation<br/>\nthey&#39;ve been shaping to their own specifications from the get go *and* in<br/>\nthe process they&#39;ll have been acquiring the skills to build in any direction<br/>\nor configuration they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost homeschooling parents are on a continuum between the two extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first sticking point doesn&#39;t get talked about much. It just sort of<br/>\nevolves out of taking the unschooling journey. It&#39;s hard to stay on the fast<br/>\ntrack to Harvard when you realize how wonderful the flowers and streams and<br/>\nwoods are along the way ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second sticking point is where unschoolers get defensive about what is<br/>\nand isn&#39;t unschooling. Without understanding the first and then also<br/>\nrealizing the second is necessary for the first, then unschoolers can come<br/>\noff as seeming rigid and inflexible as though they&#39;re saying &quot;McDonalds is<br/>\nnot food!&quot; when it seemed like people were just generally talking about<br/>\nlunch ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo unschoolers basically believe coerced learning will interfer with the<br/>\ntype of unfolding their hoping to nurture in their child.<br/>\n<br/>\n*To me* the purpose of the list is to help people along the unschooling path<br/>\nand to share with other unschoolers. Anything else the list gets used for is<br/>\nfine as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with those two. (Others may perceive<br/>\nthe purpose of the list differently.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the defensiveness is because most people come to unschooling filled<br/>\nwith scripts about how learning needs to take place: practicing, directing<br/>\nand so forth. And those people who are trying to &quot;get&quot; unschooling need to<br/>\nsee a model free from those scripts so they can build new paradigms for<br/>\nthemselves. Whether they become radical unschoolers or not, it&#39;s still a<br/>\ndifficult process to go through and most unschoolers are sympathetic to<br/>\nnewbies coming along, being painfully aware of their own difficult journey<br/>\nto a new way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd part of it is because the list is for unschoolers to share unschooling<br/>\nwith each other. For those who aren&#39;t pure unschoolers to suggest ideas that<br/>\naren&#39;t unschooling is sort of like a visitor suggesting a Buddhist ritual<br/>\nmight be nice in the middle of the Catholic service ;-) It does cause some<br/>\nconfusion when a self-identified unschooler comes in and offers methods that<br/>\nother unschoolers are ceertain will interfer with unschooling goals and<br/>\npeople&#39;s understanding of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4NCBGcvPhRk47BV8YxIbybumhbh2ApC7PAXiHXm5e5G4BDKFU-D9TwvyJX9QeUPuyV2NaPb4k1m0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:  Unschooler/homeschooler...whatever!","postDate":"1000224201","msgId":25242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwLjEyNDhhNGM2LjI4Y2Y4ZmM5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":25241,"nextInTopic":25243,"prevInTime":25241,"nextInTime":25243,"topicId":24964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1939570719\">&lt;&lt; Some, like Sandra and<br/>\nothers, will feel strongly enough about the social impact  they begin to<br/>\nthink beyond their own children, to what it could mean for all children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a little kid I wanted to be a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a teen, I wanted to be one of these three:  missionary, teacher, <br/>\nor journalist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTadaa!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"hS3SVYYTdg5duEsQpsE7gV2AVer_rxjWmVGz3V0lLvsXxQSQccwHaRqOgEdQhjBMfXp3xS-JPFZrfNOC2-2Rcpu_xs8awl-6ty-15Tq7ug","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:  Unschooler/homeschooler...whatever!","postDate":"1000222336","msgId":25237,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCOUUyRTdELjU3MzU0NzcwQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTExLjA1NTAxNy4tMTAxMjUxLjIuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":25219,"nextInTopic":25241,"prevInTime":25236,"nextInTime":25238,"topicId":24964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I guess I never<br/>\nthought of aiming to be any sort of homeschooler.  I just wanted to be with my<br/>\nkids, and for us to live our life together.  Sort of share the journey of life so<br/>\nto speak.but it *does* work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe analogy of traveling beyond the shore is wonderfully put.  A very clear picture<br/>\nin the mind of learning at home I think.  (probably alot of other things that are<br/>\ndone against the popular opinion)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Is it so wrong to want to fiercely protect<br/>\n&gt; information we feel is unique and valuable?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, seems like a very normal, human reaction.  This sentence has really been<br/>\nsticking in my mind though...  I just don&#39;t feel a need to defend it.  If others<br/>\ndon&#39;t agree with the way I raise my children, birth my children, feed my children,<br/>\nconduct my marriage, plant my garden ect, ect so on and so on...  that is just fine<br/>\nwith me.  They can do it their way.  I just never thought of protecting and<br/>\ndefending.  Maybe I&#39;m living in a safe fog though.  (though I like that safe fog)<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As another example pure, unadulterated unschooling or vegetarianism or<br/>\n&gt; sailing or Buddhism or living off the grid information is useful to those<br/>\n&gt; who want to be those things in their pure form without compromising. The<br/>\n&gt; information is *also* useful to those who don&#39;t mind compromising. They can<br/>\n&gt; take what they like and leave the rest. On the other hand information about<br/>\n&gt; those ideas that suggests compromises for the uncomfortable parts is *only*<br/>\n&gt; useful to those who don&#39;t mind compromises but *isn&#39;t* useful to those who<br/>\n&gt; want to embrace those ideas without compromises.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I read this three or four times outloud....heee...heee...  I think I understand<br/>\nwhat you mean here.  I may be too loose in my thinking.  I am the most unrigid of<br/>\npeople.  This seems like a very rigid ...um....whats the word....  classification?<br/>\nI see things &quot;looser&quot; if that makes sense.  I have a hard time believing that<br/>\npeople are all or nothing of anything.  We (as in humans)  seems to be constantly<br/>\nchanging, and evolving in many ways...our thoughts as well as bodies.<br/>\nAm I understanding this the way you meant?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We&#39;re just trying to say here&#39;s unschooling in it&#39;s pure, unadulterated<br/>\n&gt; form.

Or take just the parts you like<br/>\n&gt; but please call it something else as a courtesy to those who are trying to<br/>\n&gt; get the pure form.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I understand this, I just can&#39;t figure out what I am I guess...  LOL.  This is<br/>\nalmost getting funny how much I keep trying to figure this out.  Maybe like I said<br/>\nbefore I don&#39;t care what I am, and I don&#39;t feel a need to defend a movement (as in<br/>\nthe unschooing movement)<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure much of my post is making sense, but I really appreciate your hard<br/>\nwork in explaining.

It&#39;s *scary* to get away from the well traveled shore. We&#39;re trying<br/>\nto show how people do navigate successfully without relying on the shoreline<br/>\nat all. There *are* some parts where you&#39;ll be scared and most people will<br/>\nfeel more comfortable retreating back to shore.
