I didn&#39;t mean to get the catfights going over Sandra&#39;s demeanor or person. I was just trying to make my points, and I admit, I sometimes resort to my own intellectual bullying.  Sandra has lots of good advice and comment. Strong opinions are good, based on her belief in her own experiences. She does, however, get carried away on the thrill of the argument, and miss the point at times. (e.g. I compared her to Ayn Rand&#39;s intellectual bullying, but I didn&#39;t mean she was a conservative capitalist. I can spot a peacenik communist right away :-)<br/>\n    Along that thread, I have been told I am so far &#39;right&#39; that John Birch is pink, and when I say &quot;liberals&quot;, I mean anyone who thinks they need to liberally disperse their commands on others. You know who I mean, the ones who use the &quot;It&#39;s good for everyone.&quot; attitude to get a majority together and create zoning laws that steal property rights. Or, the &#39;they&#39; who conspire to redistribute wealth in order to &#39;help&#39;, when, in actuality, it is just a ruse to let them build their own legacy in life, thinking that anyone who is not like them needs guidance to become &#39;better&#39;.<br/>\n    This all relates to unschooling because my point about &#39;trust&#39; is that you can only trust what you know. Teaching your children to trust what they know (and test it) is more important than teaching them to trust a &#39;system&#39; or method (graduated income tax? Who believes the rich are paying?). Some systems and methods have been passed down for thousands of years and only now do we really question them. (Is God a marketing gimmick for churches?) The internet allows us to find that we are not alone. Almost anyone can find a kindred spirit somewhere in the world just by typing a few words, or spending some time to read. It brings us all closer together, no matter how frustrated and cynical some of us may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Bridget, but don&#39;t let it worry you. I&#39;ve known people who could egg on a spirited argument in the armpits of the world, and walk away with everyone laughing. I don&#39;t think Sandra does it on purpose. There isn&#39;t enough scientific method to her responses. Hers are all from her soul, and the errors made at times add to the humanity of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Sandra, it&#39;s fun, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nDan C<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27951,"nextTopicId":27997}}
