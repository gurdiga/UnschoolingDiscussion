The points helped determine how much aid the district rec&#39;d.<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 07, 2003 1:55 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] re: 14 year olds was new member intro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/7/2003 1:47:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m actually shocked and appalled that anyone would even think of giving<br/>\n  &gt; high school SAT&#39;s to grade schoolers.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Yep, that&#39;s what happens to children who have mothers who bought into the <br/>\n  whole SCHOOLING notion like I did.
