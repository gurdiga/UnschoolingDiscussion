Love life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want my children (and by extension, myself and dh) to be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think healthy (physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually) is<br/>\nnecessary to be happy.  It&#39;s part of it, not separate.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Loving to learn&quot; is not my goal.  We learn everyday in whatever we do.<br/>\nLearning is a natural part of being alive, like breathing.  Some people want<br/>\nto limit the definition of &quot;real&quot; learning to &quot;academic&quot; ideas; some will<br/>\ninclude social concepts; and others may just say &quot;positive things&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;what&#39;s good for the child&quot; or &quot;what the child Needs to know.&quot;  I know<br/>\nplenty of homeschoolers who do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my children are happy and love life, they will automatically love<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaula used the phrase &quot;love to learn.&quot;  I think I&#39;d rather they &quot;learn to<br/>\nlove.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54665,"nextTopicId":54747}}
