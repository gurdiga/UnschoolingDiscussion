Seriously. Look at all the <br/>\ninformation I and I am sure others,just learned by Teresa asking her question. <br/>\nWithout someone asking, perhaps your own knowledge on this bit of American <br/>\ncartooning and film would not have been shared. At least to this degree. That is why <br/>\nasking questions is a good thing. It opens dialogue and learning can occur <br/>\nfrom such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx again,<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - who still hates Bugs Bunny but enjoyed learning about his history in <br/>\nspite of her disdain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bugs Bunny  Was, Re: manners / rank","postDate":"1056161509","msgId":75057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjIwLjIwMTE0OS4xNzMyLjUuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75058,"prevInTime":75056,"nextInTime":75058,"topicId":75057,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I find Bugs Bunny himself to be a sarcastic character.
