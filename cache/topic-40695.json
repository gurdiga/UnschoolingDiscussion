I feel like I have sailed a rough<br/>\nsea and finally found dry land - and that is a modest way of saying<br/>\nit!:) I have wanted to teach my kids (6) at home the unschooling way and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know there was any such thing. My kids endured school and that is<br/>\nputting it mildly. More than one has suffered to the extreme by just<br/>\nbeing in the building. I don&#39;t want to go into it all and drag up the<br/>\ntrauma. I am SO happy to have finally found exactly what I have been<br/>\nlooking for. If it weren&#39;t for my youngest son yelling and screaming and<br/>\ntelling me about his nightmares about going back to school - he&#39;s 11 - I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have bothered to investigate homeschooling again. I found this<br/>\nsite when I went to VAHE site. So now that I am on dry land I am off to<br/>\nexplore the territory!
