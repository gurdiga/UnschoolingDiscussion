I don&#39;t quite understand some accusations of not being <br/>\ninvolved in our children&#39;s lives just because we are trusting them.           <br/>\n Do we always have to expect the worse from our children?  hmmmmm...  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a conference here in Albuquerque last weekend.  One of the <br/>\nquestions I was asked was about the effects on my children and on my <br/>\nexpectations of them because of them being &quot;known&quot; unschoolers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids have been good sports all along about being &quot;poster children,&quot; and <br/>\noccasionally still I&#39;ll ask them all to go with me to meet another family, or <br/>\nto be available at the house to be seen and maybe interrogated some by <br/>\nsomeone really interested and skeptical.  (People rarely ask them anything, <br/>\nthey just kind of eyeball them sidelong.  They&#39;ll still ask Holly, but for <br/>\nsome reason, it seems, the older the kids get the less likely people are to <br/>\njust &quot;interview&quot; them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern, I told her, was that one would shoot the president or something <br/>\nand get us four pages in People magazine, where they would interview me and <br/>\nsay &quot;SO... you &#39;unschooled&#39; him?&quot;   And that maybe since everybody&#39;s looking <br/>\nI might be tempted to compromise my beliefs and offer Kirby $1000 to enroll <br/>\nin college, PLEASE!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut those are flitting worries or concerns brought out for the sake of <br/>\nstating concerns.  I&#39;m not actually worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was visiting another family whose mom explained to Holly that she <br/>\nwanted the kids to get into college, and so she was teaching them now the <br/>\nthings they would need to know, because when they&#39;re teenagers they won&#39;t <br/>\nwant to sit down and do the work.  (Holly said she had asked why she didn&#39;t <br/>\njust wait until they were older and needed to know.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly came home and told me the story, and said &quot;Mom, if I go to college and <br/>\nthere&#39;s something I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll just figure it out then!&quot;  Even though <br/>\nwe don&#39;t talk about unschooling much as we&#39;re just living our lives, she <br/>\nhears the explanations elsewhere (me talking to people who call and ask,  or <br/>\nstories that get told of online discussions or conference presentation <br/>\nmoments).  And her confidence in her ability to learn something is calm and <br/>\ndeep.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday morning Holly asked about centimeters to inches, and Keith, her dad <br/>\ngave her figures and ratios and explanations, and I just overheard.  But I <br/>\nwent to find a ruler with both, and instead the first thing I found were two <br/>\nratty old proportion rulers, the kind that my dad always had (he was a welder <br/>\nand building contractor who did specialty things of steel).  They have three <br/>\nsides, so there are six edges for markings,and it&#39;s like a footlong pyramid <br/>\n(I don&#39;t know the name of that shape, triangle ends, three long sides...)<br/>\n<br/>\n[the good part of this is at the bottom, so if you get bored, scan]<br/>\n<br/>\nThey looked at and talked about what those were good for, and I wandered off <br/>\nto keep packing up boxes of stuff to clear out of my office so Holly can have <br/>\nit as her bedroom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly went to visit a friend and ended up spending the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday came, Keith went to work, Holly and I took the van to the shop and <br/>\nwalked home with the dog through alleys, talking about construction and art <br/>\nand neighhborhoods.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I tried to learn a three-note harmony for a medieval song because <br/>\nshe wants to play with our little music group which meets Mondays.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nplay violin, but I know enough music to find where she needed to play it.  <br/>\nNot the open A string, because the notes are F, G, A, so she needed to do it <br/>\non the D string.  But the positions she knows on that string are E, Fsharp <br/>\nand G.  And she doesn&#39;t read music, she reads a kind of notation of string <br/>\nand finger, so she wasn&#39;t able to just slide up the string and use her three <br/>\nfingers in new places.  I called her teacher to ask if that was indeed the <br/>\nway to go and she said yes, but that was a position Holly wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nlearning for a long time, and couldn&#39;t we transpose.  No, because the <br/>\nvocalist needs to be where she is, and the harder part is in an easy key for <br/>\nthe rest of them/us.  Holly got frustrated and quit, and they&#39;ll work on it <br/>\nWednesday at the lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to music practice, almost two hours, Holly played with the baby of <br/>\nthe family where we practice, carrying him around and crawling around with <br/>\nhim.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to Appleby&#39;s afterward, Holly, me and Keith.  [Marty was home playing <br/>\nWarcraft III, doing Neopets games, and chatting with friendsonline.   Several <br/>\nhours of uninterrupted computer time in an empty house, he loves.  Kirby was <br/>\nat work, and going to play D&D or something straight after. ]  At the <br/>\nrestaurant there were musical instruments up on the wall as decorations, with <br/>\nband uniforms and photos of musicians, and record albums and 45s.  There was <br/>\na violin, but no bridge or strings, just the body.  That was a little <br/>\ndistracting for her because it looked so wrong. &lt;g&gt;  There was a baritone <br/>\n(which our regular-attendee friend Eric plays in band at the high school), <br/>\ntwo guitars (we have three, but one of theirs was an electric) some drums, <br/>\nand she was liking that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s only time constraint was she wanted to be home to watch the Simpsons <br/>\nat 10:00.   My husband usually goes to bed at 10:00 sharp, because he goes to <br/>\nwork at 6:00.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got home at 9:30, I went back to packing boxes, and she and Keith started <br/>\nmaking a scale model of the room, using those proportion rulers.  I came <br/>\nacross a good, clear plastic, inches/centimeters ruler and took it to her in <br/>\nthe library.  She said &quot;*OOOOOH!*&quot; like I had just brought her the coolest <br/>\nthing she had seen for a week.  Probably I had.  And not for lack of having <br/>\nseen other things, but because their conversation about centimeters had been <br/>\na good one, and her interest was real.  (And they were wanting a smoother <br/>\nstraight edge than those 40-year-old wooden rulers were offering &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA while later it was 10:00, and I said &quot;Holly, the Simpsons.&quot;  She said <br/>\n&quot;Thanks.  That&#39;s okay.&quot;    And for the next half an hour the one who really <br/>\nwanted to watch one show in a whole day, and the one who usually goes to bed <br/>\nat 10:00 no matter what, were making carefully measured rectangles to <br/>\nrepresent her bed, her dressers, her My Little Pony box, and figuring out how <br/>\nshe could best fit the furniture in that room so she could get around both <br/>\nsides of her queensized bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason Holly has a queensized bed was when she was little she told us if <br/>\nwe ever got a new bed she wanted our old one.  We hadn&#39;t thought she was <br/>\nfully serious, but she loves this old bed which is older than any of our <br/>\nkids, and although a twin or full would give her way more room, she insists <br/>\nthat THAT is her bed.  She would throw out the other furniture before losing <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was spending time with her dad (who no longer goes into overwhelming <br/>\nmath-talk about such things as he once did), and she was doing something <br/>\nbrand new and useful for life.  He was talking to her about how easily it&#39;s <br/>\ndone on computers nowadays, and how architects and designers even put in <br/>\nplants and chairs, and that there are ways to mark the outlets and...  I <br/>\nmissed most of it, but Holly missed NONE.  There was not the slightest big of <br/>\nfrustration on either one&#39;s part.  Keith happily went to bed an hour late.  <br/>\nHolly happily missed The Simpsons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43495,"nextTopicId":43654}}
