I thought a while ago that she was trying <br/>\nto get the other child&#39;s attention, but dismissed that after some incidents <br/>\nwhere she lashed out when she was exhausted. It more complicated to deal <br/>\nwith, but I&#39;m wondering now if it&#39;s a combination: a behavior she&#39;s using <br/>\nwhen she&#39;s overtired, and also when she wants to interact (but doesn&#39;t know <br/>\nhow). I think we&#39;ve been looking for one answer, and it looks like it might <br/>\nbe more than that. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour idea that she isn&#39;t sure how to ask another child to play might be on <br/>\ntarget - Kalie&#39;s our only one, and although she gets a fair amount of <br/>\nplaytime with other children, they&#39;re all just at the age where they&#39;re <br/>\nstarting to actually play with each other (instead of playing side-by-side, <br/>\nbut not involved with each other). <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - we&#39;ll give this one some thought, too!<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen her walk up to a playmate who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has been playing quietly, and kick them in in the heels for no apparent<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reason.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could she be wanting the other child to play or wanting to join in but not<br/>\n&gt; sure how to go about asking?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47740,"nextTopicId":47741}}
