Playing games, etc... can be excellent for learning and adapting.  If you are concerned with what they are seeing/doing, talk to them.  Also, have them pick games, books, activities, etc... that can be accessible while you are gone.  Is there a hobby they are interested in?  Give them plenty of opportunity to explore those things...

I am lucky that my mother has been able to care for my daughter during the day when I am working.  This will change this coming year, though.  I am beginning to look for a homeschool/unschool friendly home provider since I am unaware of any daycare facility that will cater to a school-age child all day.  My DD is 7 (and a half if you ask her... lol).  She just had her assessment a week ago, and did way better than I had thought she ever would...  So that reassured me that I am doing the right thing via unschooling.  Scary still... but I&#39;m not sure parents ever get over the worry/guilt thing with regards to doing the &quot;right&quot; thing for their child(ren).  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlicia<br/>\n<br/>\nGerard Westenberg &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:westen@...\">westen@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI know its possible to unschool and work part time - I am doing it! - but I am looking for practical ideas.
