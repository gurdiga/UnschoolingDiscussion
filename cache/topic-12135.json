It is written to a higher reading level <br/>\nthan he&#39;s ready for, but he will still get a lot out of it.  Our son pretty <br/>\nmuch learned to read from Nintendo Power and scriptures.  Since he was really <br/>\ninterested in winning the games, he would pour over the magazine and work <br/>\nreally hard to understand what was written.  His reading level improved <br/>\ndramatically and all at his own effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The scripture reading came from daily family reading.  If you are not into <br/>\nscripture/religion, I highly recommend having some form of &#39;higher&#39; reading <br/>\nthat the family does together on a regular basis (Shakespeare, other <br/>\nclassics, or poetry for instance).  There is something about reading to the <br/>\ncadence of a &#39;different&#39; language that stimulates the reading ability.  FWIW, <br/>\nDr. Seuss or Shel Silverstein are great for this, IMO! )<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you didn&#39;t necessarily ask for an educational gift.  &lt;g&gt;  Eight is <br/>\nthe age we finally got DS his own subscription to Nintendo Power.  He kept <br/>\nsnagging his brother&#39;s copy and having his personal copy brought much peace <br/>\nto our home!
