Cultivating friendships with <br/>\n  them now may very well lead to future playdates with your children.  <br/>\n  Perhaps you have a birthing group?

(I&#39;m thinking they must get <br/>\ndone with their lessons earlier in the day than people doing a whole <br/>\ncurriculum.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that if I were surrounded by a large group of conservative <br/>\npeople (and if I were a Christian myself), I would try hosting playdates <br/>\n(if they would come) or open-ended art exploration or science <br/>\nexploration days.  I think that would be a way to find who are the most <br/>\nflexible and kind-hearted people in the group, or at least who had the <br/>\nmost interesting kids.  I suspect (without much knowledge) that in a <br/>\nfundamentalist HS group the strictest people might be the loudest, and <br/>\nit might *seem* that everyone else toed the line all the time.  But I <br/>\nthink, in their hearts, there are some moms who are less adamant, less <br/>\ndoctrinaire, and maybe more meek who are more tolerant than the <br/>\nparty-line, or at least less bossy about it.   So I think friendships <br/>\nmay be possible with some of the less hard-line members of the group, <br/>\nbut they are probably hiding behind the hard-line members for fear of <br/>\nstepping out of line and looking soft.  I think it would take time to <br/>\nget to know them.  (Although, maybe you can know them right off the bat <br/>\nbased on how decently they treat their children within the essential <br/>\nframework of childraising their church promotes.

I have older kids (15 and 11).  We&#39;re in our <br/>\nsecond year of unschooling after years of more traditional homeschooling.  It <br/>\nis a huge Christian Homeschooling area and even the group the we used to be <br/>\ninvolved with and who I once considered  inclusive thinks we are weird. Quite <br/>\nhonestly, I never quite fit in because of my liberal viewpoints and once I <br/>\ndiscovered unschooling, I really didn&#39;t fit in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter outings where I was asked in an openly negative tone things like..&quot;Are <br/>\nyou still doing that unschooling thing?&#39;&quot;or a mom saying she unschools in the <br/>\nsame sentence as talking about math curriculum, I just quit hanging out with <br/>\nthem.  One woman in particular was so caustic and dominant in the group that I <br/>\nfound I didn&#39;t want her negative energy surrounding me or my children. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to spend any time around people who disrespect their children in their <br/>\ninteractions with them or in their conversations about them or treat me with <br/>\ndisdain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard Elton John say in an interview the other day, &quot;I&#39;m 57 and I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel like pussy footing around any more.&quot;  Not that he ever did but that&#39;s just <br/>\nhow I feel. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Some members of that group were not only a million miles from unschooling <br/>\nbut so obviously were more into controlling their children than enjoying and <br/>\nhonoring them.  I just don&#39;t want my children around it and I don&#39;t feel like <br/>\nputting up with crap any more..:-) Right now that means we are doing most things <br/>\nwith just the three of us but we&#39;re all okay with that for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n I  think it may be more difficult to find other unschoolers when your kids <br/>\nare older.  Unschoolers are few and far between to begin with and beginning a <br/>\ngroup just naturally will have much younger children. The answer seems to lie <br/>\nin not so much looking for unschoolers (although I haven&#39;t given up) but <br/>\nencouraging each of our interests and passions and meeting other chilren and adults <br/>\nthat share them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe times we are around other unschoolers are just the best and I try to <br/>\ncarry that energy and joy with me.  Last weekend, we drove 6 hours to a one day <br/>\nunschooling conference and that should get us through a few weeks!  My 15 year <br/>\nold keeps in touch through the internet with other unschoolers she met at <br/>\nconferences and Not Back to School Camp.  She hangs out with public school and more <br/>\ntraditionally homeschooled kids some but I think her spirit is fed by her <br/>\ncontacts with other unschoolers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGail <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Socializing","postDate":"1100695799","msgId":101126,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMTE3MTI0OTUxLlRaUkoxOTMzOC5tdGExMS5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbGVpZ2g+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMTE2LjIzMTMyMy4yMzAwLjQuZWNvdG9waWFuQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101124,"nextInTopic":101129,"prevInTime":101125,"nextInTime":101127,"topicId":101090,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lisa, Aren t any of the parents willing to let their dd come over for a play date without them?

I hope I&#39;m just emailing you, here.  Congrats on being newly wed and I love the thought that you&#39;re already putting into your children&#39;s future!<br/>\n<br/>\nSocialization:  I&#39;m desperately seeking some relaxed homeschoolers/unschoolers in our area.  My closest homeschooling friend had just passed away after a courageous three year battle with Cancer.  We&#39;re still friends with her hubbie and children, who will continue to homeschool this year, but will probably start with the school system next year. As more and more people look at unschooling, I&#39;m sure there will be more and more opportunity for socialization, which, btw, is the last reason children go to school.  Remember the rules:  no talking, no passing notes, etc.  Socialization is only allowed at recess or a few precious moments within the classroom.  Recess time is not necessarily all positive socialization, either.  My son came home three different times with life-threatening concussion.  He was only in school that year from February until June.   Is it any wonder he&#39;s no longer in school?  The kid that hit him had a lot of problems and was mentally handicapped.  He was bigger than me at the time (grade six, my son was one of the smallest kids in his class), and his parents felt he could do no wrong.  Police had already completed an investigation into this child&#39;s behaviour and I thought all was well before allowing my son into that school.  I was wrong with a capital W.  :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re actually leaving now for socialization with my friend&#39;s family (funeral was just a week ago today), then some shopping and a hockey game.  Can&#39;t ever possibly need more socialization than what you get at a hockey game!  ;-)  Especially when you have a 15yo playing! lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I&#39;m much help.  I do live in a very rural area, too.  Homeschoolers are hard enough to find, around here, as it is, never mind any that are relaxed enough to spend an afternoon socializing.  I am still hopeful to find someone in the area!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings to you,<br/>\nDonna Kovacs:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kovacsfamily.tripod.com\">http://kovacsfamily.tripod.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Lila <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 16, 2004 1:01 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Socializing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is my first time posting; I&#39;m new to the group.

I think it&#39;s important to listen to your children and meet whatever<br/>\nneed for friends they have, if you want homeschooling to be successful.  For<br/>\nsome of them that means, don&#39;t pressure them to meet new people because they<br/>\nare satisfied with the one or two good friends they already have.  For<br/>\nother&#39;s that means, take their need for more friends seriously, even if it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t match your own, and go outside your comfort zone and get them into<br/>\nsituations where they can meet other kids with similar interests.  Some kids<br/>\nseem to have a high need to be with friends more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest reached school age, and didn&#39;t go, I felt like she would need<br/>\na peer group to form wonderful childhood memories with, since she lacked<br/>\nschoolmates and neighborhood friends.  (we live in the country.)  We joined<br/>\na group homeschoolers for a relaxed play group but my dd was very unhappy<br/>\nand stressed being in the group. (other people couldn&#39;t see it, but I knew<br/>\nshe just wasn&#39;t herself there.) We tried a few other group activities and<br/>\nshe was never overly happy with them.  She just doesn&#39;t like group dynamics<br/>\nvery much.  Thankfully, it didn&#39;t take me too long to realize that she is<br/>\nhappiest just having one friend over at a time and having one or two good<br/>\nfriends, as apposed to a group of friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we dropped out of the group, I felt like I lost my argument for<br/>\nsocialization, because when we were in it, I could say, we have this great<br/>\ngroup of homeschoolers and we get together regularly for socialization.  But<br/>\nafter thinking about it more, I just started pointing out that the most<br/>\nrewarding relationships that I have in my life are the ones that are close<br/>\nand meaningful.  I am not a group person myself.  I am not sure why I<br/>\nthought that kids would be any different, other than that they are forced to<br/>\nbe in groups by going to school.  I do have some good memories of playing<br/>\nwith the kids in the neighborhood after school, but my best memories are the<br/>\nones of hanging out with close friends who had similar interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela ~ Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163132749,"authorName":"ivorygrace7@aol.com","from":"ivorygrace7@...","profile":"ivorygrace7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Socializing","postDate":"1100607286","msgId":101094,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJiLjRhODJlM2ZlLjJlY2I0OTM2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":101093,"nextInTopic":101095,"prevInTime":101093,"nextInTime":101095,"topicId":101090,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"All of my kids are far more  social than me, and I attended public school.

Our brains are so full of the image of school that<br/>\nit&#39;s hard to imagine what it&#39;s like without school. For instance it&#39;s hard<br/>\nto imagine that if kids are in school that homeschooled kids have anyone to<br/>\nbe with. But reality is very different. There&#39;s a network of homeschoolers<br/>\nout there who get together for social reasons and trips and classes. And in<br/>\nfact, at least in the Boston area, there&#39;s almost too many activities to<br/>\nchoose from :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for being different ... it&#39;s really the schooled kids who are warped.<br/>\nOnce you&#39;re out of the system and see what natural life is like, you realize<br/>\nhow bizarre the social atmosphere is at school and how kids have to change<br/>\nthemselves to fit it. Because school is an expected part of life, we don&#39;t<br/>\nlook at it objectively. It just is the way it is. But if you were to go to<br/>\nsome natural tribe in South America and tell them that from now on all their<br/>\nchildren would basically lead separate lives from each other and from their<br/>\nparents, spending majority of their waking hours with just their age mates<br/>\nand a stranger so that husband and wife could spend their days apart, what<br/>\nwould that look like? At what age would that seem like a normal, healthy<br/>\nlife to lead?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when family life is made whole again, kids get to live as biology<br/>\nintended. They are lively and creative and happy and whole :-) Unschooled<br/>\nkids get to grow up being the way adults spend a lot of energy (and therapy<br/>\nand money on self-help books) trying to get back to. Unschooled kids don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to throw off the baggage of school and the warping messages of school<br/>\n&quot;socialization&quot; to find out who they are and what they love and to give<br/>\nthemselves permission to pursue it because they&#39;ve been living it their<br/>\nwhole unschooled lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to see what unschooled kids are really like -- as opposed to<br/>\nwhat you imagine -- is to attend an unschooling conference or get together<br/>\nwith an unschooling group.
