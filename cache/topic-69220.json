I just looked it up in my compact dictionary and it is said to mean<br/>\nwoman or wife.  It also says that it can be offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not aware of an offensive usage.  Honestly.  I have never heard anyone<br/>\nuse it offensively in my presence or in any of the literature that I have<br/>\nread.  I am ignorant of squaw being a derogatory term.  At least I was.  Now<br/>\nit has been pointed out to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage usage is another thing I discuss with my kids.  Lisa recently asked<br/>\nme if I knew there were two &quot;dams&quot;.  We looked both up in my dictionary and<br/>\nin her children&#39;s dictionary.  Only one of them was listed in the children&#39;s<br/>\ndictionary - the one that refers to something blocking water, of course.  We<br/>\ntalk about how some words used to mean one thing and have come to be &quot;swear&quot;<br/>\nwords or derogatory terms.  We talk about why certain words are best avoided<br/>\nin certain situations.  We talk about the impression others get when you use<br/>\ncertain words liberally.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69210,"nextTopicId":69219}}
