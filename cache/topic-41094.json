We let a couple of our <br/>\n&gt; (formerly) schooled kids have some time to unschool their way into life <br/>\n&gt; after they left school.  (These were the ones whose other parent opposed <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling.)  I think it did them a lot of good.  What&#39;s so magic about <br/>\n&gt; age 19 that a kid automatically has to be grown up and out into the working <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; world by then?  We aren&#39;t supposed to worry if a kid isn&#39;t reading by some <br/>\n&gt; certain age.  Why should they be ready to work by a certain age?  I&#39;ve even <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; heard of some parents who were willing to support their kid away from home <br/>\n&gt; but not in college during the &quot;college years&quot; if they were doing anything <br/>\n&gt; that could lead to a career.*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with this, I went through this myself when I was 17.  Back then, it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t considered homeschooling or unschooling by my mother it was just <br/>\ndropping out.  Her theory was if your not at school, your at work.  Even <br/>\nthough my leaving school was prompted by her.  She hounded me for weeks to <br/>\nget a job, and we lived ten miles from the nearest town and she rarely gave <br/>\nme access to the car.  So my options were very limited.  The final result was <br/>\nthat I never found any job or career that I was passionate about.  I stayed <br/>\nwith my jobs for quite a while (never worked anywhere less than a year) but <br/>\nthey never were important enough to pursue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strange thing about this is, I had a job when I was 15 that I enjoyed.  <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t prompted by anyone else and I was able to juggle school, work and <br/>\nsocial activities.  My point here, is that people seem to have the view that <br/>\nas of such and such an age, we should have our lives planned out.  Isn&#39;t the <br/>\npoint of unschooling, not to follow &quot;our&quot; plans but to facilitate the child&#39;s <br/>\ninterest?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really new at this method of teaching, it wasn&#39;t until recently that I <br/>\nhave realized my own experience with unschooling (yes folks, mom is still <br/>\ndenying it).  But I know if I had been left to make the decisions on my own, <br/>\nit would not have taken so long to find what I enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I think chucking a kid out of the house at a certain age to make it on <br/>\ntheir own is something like throwing a kid in the water so he&#39;ll learn to <br/>\nswim*<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember this being an option in the original post, but in my case <br/>\nthis is exactly what happened.  In my experience this only leads to <br/>\nalienation from the parent.  Everything you have worked the last 17 years for <br/>\nis gone, no trust, loss of respect, and tons of resentment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just thought I would add my thoughts.  I hope everything works out <br/>\nwith the 20 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41286,"nextTopicId":41334}}
