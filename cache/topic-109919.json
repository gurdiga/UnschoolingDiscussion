Ideas for snacks containing protein is not to increase <br/>\nthe overall quantity of protein necessarily (since each person&#39;s <br/>\nprotein needs vary) but rather to provide ideas for things that are <br/>\nrelatively quick and easy and tasty and help meet that need For <br/>\ninstance, hummus scooped in bits of flat bread is a quick finger <br/>\nfood that can be munched while playing board games. (If breastmilk <br/>\nis 5% protein and a baby averages 6 ounces of it every 3 hours or <br/>\nabout 6-8 times per day, totalling 36-48 ounces, then 2 to 4 ounces <br/>\nof protein or so spread over a day is about the same amount, not <br/>\nmore, just different sources - a piece of cheese, some hummus, <br/>\nwhatever). I&#39;ve looked at McDougall&#39;s information and I tracked what <br/>\nwe ate each day for a few weeks and wouldn&#39;t you know it, we still <br/>\ncame in within what his &#39;good range&#39; except on days when we had <br/>\nchicken for dinner - we still ate grilled cheese sandwiches and nuts <br/>\nand cheese and such. The thing was we were eating it spread out <br/>\nthroughout the day to help balance the carbs/sugars (crackers, <br/>\nfruit, veggies, etc). And keeping that balance is definitely helpful <br/>\nfor my DS to maintain an even keel emotionally and behaviorally.<br/>\nJust my two cents<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] snack ideas for kids","postDate":"1132330499","msgId":110008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmZC5kOWVhYmVhLjMwYWY1ODAzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109998,"nextInTopic":110013,"prevInTime":110007,"nextInTime":110009,"topicId":109919,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
