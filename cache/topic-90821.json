Going to school<br/>\nmatinee of the visiting Shakespeare company once a semester and joining a<br/>\nrowdy crowd of kids who are just glad to be out to see a walked through<br/>\nperformance? Memories, memories. Perhaps he means the rush the herd through<br/>\nthe art gallery, looking only at the assigned pictures and fill in the<br/>\nblanks on the workbook interaction. Or perhaps he is referring to band<br/>\npractice, or standing in line to use the potter�s wheel because that is the<br/>\nassignment, or being told to paint pictures of fish today. :P~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously though, sometimes arguing is futile, but getting him to expand on<br/>\nhis position and explode his own myths is more helpful.

And like any good<br/>\norganic movement (-grin-) this would grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe schools would get less money, and they would have less kids.  They would<br/>\nreally be forced by hard tax numbers to try new things--really have to sell<br/>\ntheir schools to the parents.  And less kids in school could mean that the<br/>\nones there actually get a decent experience.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly this sounds something like vouchers. I think NHEN has a forum<br/>\ndebating this kind of stuff. Also there is the whole �Should children who<br/>\nare in PS ISP�s be counted/labelled as home schoolers or public schoolers�<br/>\nissue that was around last year. Public schools are targeting �services� to<br/>\nhs�ers with the agenda of pulling them back in and receiving the tax moneys<br/>\nbased on attendance. Again there are many other forums for that discussion,<br/>\nwhich is so not unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Califoria there is the private school option for hs�ing. Many parents I<br/>\nknow get educator discounts at all kinds of places, including bookstores.<br/>\nAlso parents in my local group arrange field trips (hate the phrase but<br/>\nthat�s what they are I guess) and by sheer weight of numbers get the school<br/>\ngroup discount. We don�t go on too many of these yet, since historically<br/>\nJayn always wants to leave early, but it must be different for the hosts to<br/>\nsee such a wide age range in one group, compared to school groups of one<br/>\ngrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think homeschooling is already a growing movement, but I don�t care<br/>\nwhether it grows or not. I can�t worry about every child in school and<br/>\ndirect my energies and thoughts towards school system reform. In California<br/>\nthere is yet another bond issue on the ballot for LA Unified School<br/>\nDistrict�s massive building program. If it passes property taxes will<br/>\nincrease again � part of my rent goes towards that. They haven�t spent all<br/>\nthe last bond, building and improving school facilities. There are more<br/>\nchildren than spaces supposedly available, yet the kids still head off each<br/>\nday, some onto buses to other areas. They talk about increasing the number<br/>\nof �seats� and the number of school children is growing. Better minds than<br/>\nmine are spending all their time debating these issues. Since we do have<br/>\nschools, and if we must have schools in existence, I�d rather they had<br/>\nenough money and were good, but Jayn isn�t going regardless of how good they<br/>\nare, and I hope she never wants to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My friend&#39;s one comment on that was, &quot;And then you create a two tiered<br/>\nsystem.  Those in school and those at home.  But I saw we already have a<br/>\nclassist society and to pretend we don&#39;t is foolish.  Let&#39;s open up the<br/>\noptions.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy fear is that accepting tax money closes the options, and leads to more<br/>\nrequirements. Some of the parents in my group are in charter schools. It<br/>\nseems like they have fewer options and must give more (documenting work<br/>\ndone, keeping up with the curriculums) than the law asks for because of it.<br/>\nThey have chosen the discounted materials and books over the level of<br/>\nfreedom available to them in CA. In some ways we have a system with 50 tiers<br/>\n� since every State is different.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
