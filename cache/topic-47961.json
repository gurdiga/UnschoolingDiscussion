I was lucky my parents were older when they got to me,  my older siblings got the physical abuse.<br/>\nIn this new life for us, (unschooling) it is really opening my eyes to how different my family lived, compared to many.   I thought that was the right way to parent.  My mother would still argue that we are just helping our children see what it right.  How to eat, what to say, how to react, etc...<br/>\nI never knew how to do those things.  She never let me figure it out.<br/>\nNow it&#39;s very hard to let those things go and it definitely comes into conflict with new ideas (new ideas to me anyway) such as attachment parenting, the continuum concept and peaceful/joyful parenting.  For me,  I know I have to try and seperate my childhood feelings/sadness from how I react to my children.   I believe that this is my biggest hurdle.    If I am completely rested and feeling healthy, I do pretty well at it.   But yet on the other hand if I am feeling the way I am right now how I did last night, I fail miserably at it!!              What happens with me also is when I&#39;m around my family, my parents especially, I fall back into those feelings.   Hence then I come back home and yuck!              Slap on top of that a bad cold and my period and I think its a recipe for disaster!!

It could be something as simple as making a mess with water.<br/>\n&gt; These realizations make it hard for me to accept her apology in my<br/>\n&gt; heart. She said to me, &quot;I felt about you the way you feel about Jayn&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; There must have been something in my face, because her next words were<br/>\n&gt; &quot;you don&#39;t believe me&quot;.

I am the bulwark against the teeming<br/>\n&gt; rages of my family history. There is nothing that Jayn could ever do<br/>\n&gt; that would cause me to spank her, or believe she deserved to be spanked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With gratitude,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>God Robin! What a great post! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is long and full of some much needed venting, so skip if you need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say that you sometimes think *My Mom would have hit me for this* is <br/>\nit at times when Jayn is doing something and you are frustrated and have to <br/>\nthink before you act? Or are you just watching Jayn, thinking, but not in the <br/>\nleast upset? (makes no sense? &lt;g&gt;) I ask this because, unlike you, I used to <br/>\nspank and I still find there are times when I have to stop, remind myself how <br/>\nunfair I used to think things were in my house. How much I hated the belt, <br/>\nthe spoon, the hand, my parents. And remind myself that I am not going to <br/>\ntake my anger at a perceived situation and turn into that wild woman I once <br/>\nsaw in the mirror. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany times I have to remind myself that the ideas I have about how children <br/>\nshould act come from being hit, or even just the looks. I&#39;m not exaggerating <br/>\nwhen I say that I could eat too loud, breath the wrong way, sit the wrong way <br/>\nand get a nasty look or a pinch or a slap. I remember too many colds, not <br/>\nbeing able to breath through my stuffed up nose and forcing myself not to <br/>\nbreath through my mouth, cause *mouth breathers look like retarded dopes*. I <br/>\nremember sitting at the table with a plate of food being taught how to eat. <br/>\nYou keep one hand in your lap, you take a fork of food and put it in your <br/>\nmouth. You close your mouth, but not your teeth, around the food. You take <br/>\nthe food off the fork, but don&#39;t scrape your teeth on the fork and make an <br/>\nirritating noise. You slide the fork out of your mouth, without opening your <br/>\nlips too far, making sure your teeth don&#39;t make any noise, then you set your <br/>\nfork down and chew, making sure not to open your mouth. Eating chips was pure <br/>\nterror. No noise. I remember eating a chip very slowly to keep from getting <br/>\nsmacked. There were ways to dust, to vacuum, to make a bed, to eat, to wash <br/>\ndishes, to set a thermostat, to put pillows on a couch... <br/>\n<br/>\nLast Thanksgiving Darin was in the kitchen with my Mom, Sister and me and he <br/>\nasked if there really was a right and wrong way to do dishes. My Dad and <br/>\nBrother walked in just then and my whole family just looked at him. I looked <br/>\nat Darin, shrugged my shoulders and said, I told you so. He understands me <br/>\nnow when I sit at a table and cry just to keep myself from saying something <br/>\nto the kids about how they are eating. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Sister called me a month or so ago, crying. She had just moved to <br/>\nPennsylvania, just gotten married, and was trying to set her new husband&#39;s <br/>\nkitchen in order. She had taken everything out of the cabinets, washed every <br/>\nsingle cup, fork, cookie sheet and bowl and put everything away. She had <br/>\nstacked all the dry goods up in the *right* order, placed all the cans on the <br/>\nshelves in the *correct* place. That evening, her husband did the dishes *all <br/>\nwrong* and then put them away with no regard to how Renee&#39; had organized <br/>\neverything. They didn&#39;t have a fight, but he couldn&#39;t get her to understand <br/>\nthat it was okay if he put a bowl on top of plates. He put some groceries <br/>\naway and he just stacked the cans in the cabinet. She called, crying and the <br/>\nfirst words out of her mouth were &quot;Aren&#39;t the cans of green beans supposed to <br/>\nall be together? Doesn&#39;t the cereal all have to be stacked in order of box <br/>\nsize?&quot; She was frantic. She wanted me to tell her new husband that he did it <br/>\nall wrong, that there was a right way to do things, to explain it to him, to <br/>\nmake him understand. But what I heard was a terrified little girl. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I had avoided passing some of this crap onto my kids. I have never <br/>\nsaid to anyone how to wash a dish, or put things away in a certain order. I <br/>\nwas wrong, I didn&#39;t have to. Actions speak volumes. Moly was washing dishes <br/>\nthe other night and Darin went in and asked her if she wanted help. She said <br/>\nsure, you wash, I&#39;ll dry. So they were going about it and about 5 minutes <br/>\nlater, she came into me and said, &quot;Daddy&#39;s washing the dishes in the wrong <br/>\norder.&quot; Darin laughed and said to me that she is just like me! Then he told <br/>\nme that when I was gone for a week last summer, she had helped him with the <br/>\ngroceries and they were putting things away and she put things in the cabinet <br/>\njust like I did. He said she dusts like me, folds clothes like me... I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe it. Sometimes I really feel like I haven&#39;t escaped all that <br/>\nabuse, and I have passed it on through my genes or something. Its like ugly <br/>\ncold fingers that have reached past my efforts to keep my kids safe and <br/>\ntouched them despite me. I really hate that. Does anyone who has made it to <br/>\nthe end of my long post, go through this too? I hope not. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

And sometimes I say &quot;My mom would have spanked me <br/>\nfor that, so it&#39;s hard for me not to see you do that and get kind of <br/>\nagitated.&quot; (or whatever)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust today I was really angry with Holly, so I asked her to go and check <br/>\nwhether the back gate was locked.  Kirby had gone out, to walk to work (since <br/>\nI can&#39;t take him) and I wanted her to make sure it was locked.  But I mostly <br/>\nwanted her to go for a walk outside and breathe.  While she was out I told <br/>\nMarty, &quot;Marty I&#39;m really angry with Holly, so much I felt like hitting her.  <br/>\nHelp me!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty said, &quot;Okay, you want to hit me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said no, that I just wanted him to talk to me to help me figure out how to <br/>\nsolve the afternoon&#39;s social problems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was supposed to go to a movie with some teenaged girls, homeschoolers.  <br/>\nAnother homeschooling family invited her over at 3:00, for just a while. She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know yet whether they were going to the 4:30 or 7:00 show.  She was <br/>\nvery indecisive, and as the mom was calling me from some phone somewhere and <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t call her back, Holly said okay.  Then she started whimpering and <br/>\nwhining and saying she also wanted to go swimming with her dad at 6:00.  So <br/>\nmarty called and found out the movie was at 4:30.  So we can cancel the one <br/>\nplaydate, she can go to the 4:30 movie and then swim with her dad.  Then she <br/>\nstarts whining that she really wants to play at 3:00.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was the whining and pouting and hitting the floor that was bugging me the <br/>\nmost.  The embarrassment of having to tell this other really nice family that <br/>\nHolly wasn&#39;t able to go after all (they&#39;re going to come pick her up).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a horrible big deal, but my mother&#39;s spirit came into me and wanted <br/>\nto tell Holly to go to her room, she couldn&#39;t go anywhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s stupid, and not a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we discussed (Marty and I, in front of Holly who was pouting) what all the <br/>\nfactors were.  It&#39;s really not a huge problem.  The family won&#39;t be crushed <br/>\nabout Holly not playing; they had some stuff to pick up here anyway, and it&#39;s <br/>\njust a very few miles out of their way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out after the movie the girls are going to the mall, and so she <br/>\ncancelled swimming with her dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll my angst and frustration was MINE!  (Mine and my mom&#39;s.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made the difference was me thinking &quot;How important is it?&quot;  And seeing <br/>\nthat Marty wasn&#39;t the least bit agitated, even though there was a time that <br/>\nhe was in on the movie plan and he can&#39;t go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly will see her friend for probably half an hour this afternoon and then <br/>\nNOT go home with them.  She can show her her new room (my old office) and I <br/>\ncan talk to the mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo long, but freesh evidence that the urge to smite still comes upon me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2099467,"authorName":"EBA7009@aol.com","from":"EBA7009@...","profile":"mikemom3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: shift in thinking (got a bit -make that very- lo...","postDate":"1035573167","msgId":48017,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0My4xNDM1ZjE0LjJhZWFmMWFmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48015,"nextInTopic":48050,"prevInTime":48016,"nextInTime":48018,"topicId":47961,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/25/02 6:55:23 PM !!!First Boot!!!, Dnowens@aol.com ...

What a great post! <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is long and full of some much needed venting, so skip if you need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say that you sometimes think *My Mom would have hit me for this* is <br/>\nit at times when Jayn is doing something and you are frustrated and have to <br/>\nthink before you act? Or are you just watching Jayn, thinking, but not in the <br/>\nleast upset? (makes no sense? &lt;g&gt;) I ask this because, unlike you, I used to <br/>\nspank and I still find there are times when I have to stop, remind myself how <br/>\nunfair I used to think things were in my house. How much I hated the belt, <br/>\nthe spoon, the hand, my parents. And remind myself that I am not going to <br/>\ntake my anger at a perceived situation and turn into that wild woman I once <br/>\nsaw in the mirror. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany times I have to remind myself that the ideas I have about how children <br/>\nshould act come from being hit, or even just the looks. I&#39;m not exaggerating <br/>\nwhen I say that I could eat too loud, breath the wrong way, sit the wrong way <br/>\nand get a nasty look or a pinch or a slap. I remember too many colds, not <br/>\nbeing able to breath through my stuffed up nose and forcing myself not to <br/>\nbreath through my mouth, cause *mouth breathers look like retarded dopes*. I <br/>\nremember sitting at the table with a plate of food being taught how to eat. <br/>\nYou keep one hand in your lap, you take a fork of food and put it in your <br/>\nmouth. You close your mouth, but not your teeth, around the food. You take <br/>\nthe food off the fork, but don&#39;t scrape your teeth on the fork and make an <br/>\nirritating noise. You slide the fork out of your mouth, without opening your <br/>\nlips too far, making sure your teeth don&#39;t make any noise, then you set your <br/>\nfork down and chew, making sure not to open your mouth. Eating chips was pure <br/>\nterror. No noise. I remember eating a chip very slowly to keep from getting <br/>\nsmacked. There were ways to dust, to vacuum, to make a bed, to eat, to wash <br/>\ndishes, to set a thermostat, to put pillows on a couch... <br/>\n<br/>\nLast Thanksgiving Darin was in the kitchen with my Mom, Sister and me and he <br/>\nasked if there really was a right and wrong way to do dishes. My Dad and <br/>\nBrother walked in just then and my whole family just looked at him. I looked <br/>\nat Darin, shrugged my shoulders and said, I told you so. He understands me <br/>\nnow when I sit at a table and cry just to keep myself from saying something <br/>\nto the kids about how they are eating. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Sister called me a month or so ago, crying. She had just moved to <br/>\nPennsylvania, just gotten married, and was trying to set her new husband&#39;s <br/>\nkitchen in order. She had taken everything out of the cabinets, washed every <br/>\nsingle cup, fork, cookie sheet and bowl and put everything away. She had <br/>\nstacked all the dry goods up in the *right* order, placed all the cans on the <br/>\nshelves in the *correct* place. That evening, her husband did the dishes *all <br/>\nwrong* and then put them away with no regard to how Renee&#39; had organized <br/>\neverything. They didn&#39;t have a fight, but he couldn&#39;t get her to understand <br/>\nthat it was okay if he put a bowl on top of plates. He put some groceries <br/>\naway and he just stacked the cans in the cabinet. She called, crying and the <br/>\nfirst words out of her mouth were &quot;Aren&#39;t the cans of green beans supposed to <br/>\nall be together? Doesn&#39;t the cereal all have to be stacked in order of box <br/>\nsize?&quot; She was frantic. She wanted me to tell her new husband that he did it <br/>\nall wrong, that there was a right way to do things, to explain it to him, to <br/>\nmake him understand. But what I heard was a terrified little girl. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I had avoided passing some of this crap onto my kids. I have never <br/>\nsaid to anyone how to wash a dish, or put things away in a certain order. I <br/>\nwas wrong, I didn&#39;t have to. Actions speak volumes. Moly was washing dishes <br/>\nthe other night and Darin went in and asked her if she wanted help. She said <br/>\nsure, you wash, I&#39;ll dry. So they were going about it and about 5 minutes <br/>\nlater, she came into me and said, &quot;Daddy&#39;s washing the dishes in the wrong <br/>\norder.&quot; Darin laughed and said to me that she is just like me! Then he told <br/>\nme that when I was gone for a week last summer, she had helped him with the <br/>\ngroceries and they were putting things away and she put things in the cabinet <br/>\njust like I did. He said she dusts like me, folds clothes like me... I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe it. Sometimes I really feel like I haven&#39;t escaped all that <br/>\nabuse, and I have passed it on through my genes or something. Its like ugly <br/>\ncold fingers that have reached past my efforts to keep my kids safe and <br/>\ntouched them despite me. I really hate that. Does anyone who has made it to <br/>\nthe end of my long post, go through this too?
