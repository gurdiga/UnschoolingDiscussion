My own kids fight A LOT and I was also at a loss to deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t thought to &quot;remove the apparent victim&quot; first.

I always felt like in order to be &quot;fair&quot; (and not knowing what really happened) I had to send them both to their rooms.

A trick I learned as a Jr. High <br/>\n  teacher has served well.  To break up a fight, grab the loser and remove him. <br/>\n  He WANTS to be saved.  If you grab the winning participant, you  might get <br/>\n  hurt.  If you remove the underdog, they both save face.  He can think he <br/>\n  wouldn&#39;t have necessarily lost.  The winner still thinks he won.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I talk to the apparent victim first.  Sometimes it turns out he wasn&#39;t such a <br/>\n  victim.  But In our case at home, with my boys, that has usually been Marty, <br/>\n  who&#39;s younger by two and a half years.  At the moment they&#39;re 16 and 14 and <br/>\n  physical problems might be over.  Kirby&#39;s learned enough karate that he&#39;s <br/>\n  developed the self control that ideally comes with being able to seriously <br/>\n  hurt someone.  And they&#39;re both verbal, so physical isn&#39;t their first <br/>\n  thought.  So what I&#39;m going to tell is a summary of various things over the <br/>\n  years when they were younger, in various stages.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  What has worked best is taking the one away and letting him tell me what <br/>\n  happened.  While he&#39;s calming down and stating his case, I&#39;m asking him what <br/>\n  he did to try to make things better.  &quot;Did you think of doing this?&quot;  &quot;No,&quot; <br/>\n  or &quot;Yes, but it didn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  So partly it&#39;s a session in possibilities.   Then that kid&#39;s calmer.  But I <br/>\n  remind them that I&#39;m responsible for seeing that BOTH of them are safe in <br/>\n  their own homes, and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then I go to the other kid (usually Kirby) who&#39;s calm by then too, and ask <br/>\n  for his side.  He tells me the whole thing, and I ask him at the end (since <br/>\n  I&#39;m wanting his whole story to compare to the other whole version) whether he <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t think he could have prevented it by this or that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then I say &quot;Marty says you said/did this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unfortunately in many of the scenarios, Marty had sneaked up close enough to <br/>\n  hear and jumped in with &quot;I DID NOT!&quot; so I have to go and deposit Marty <br/>\n  elsewhere and say later &quot;That really didn&#39;t help me convince him, y&#39;know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  So Kirby tells me his version of the evils Marty contributed to the argument. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I remind Kirby he&#39;s older and has a responsibility to show some maturity and <br/>\n  set an example (as appropriate, if appropriate).  And I tell him yada yada, <br/>\n  Marty needs to be safe in his own home, and not feel like his life is ruined <br/>\n  because he has an older brother who&#39;s bullying him (if appropriate...)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Finally I&#39;d go back to Marty and say &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me this part?&quot;   or <br/>\n  &quot;Kirby says you threw this/said this...&quot;  And I go through it again with <br/>\n  Marty.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I know lots of people say to let kids work out their own stuff but I think <br/>\n  it&#39;s lazy at best and sadistic at worst.  My parents raised two cousins of <br/>\n  mine and one was mean and violent and frustrated and hurt both me and my <br/>\n  sister.  There should have been more active supervision and peace making and <br/>\n  advisement.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I know some people believe each soul chose their family and they need to <br/>\n  learn to work out their own interactions.  I think it&#39;s random, personally.  <br/>\n  I don&#39;t think any one of my kids needs to be the material on which another <br/>\n  kid works out his karma unchecked anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So in the interest of helping them develop a set of alternative responses and <br/>\n  social skills, and keeping them safe, I let each tell his story in private <br/>\n  instead of in front of the other.  It cuts out arguments instead of turning a <br/>\n  little argument into a big one (Jerry Springer show style, in worst cases).  <br/>\n  And it lets each kid vent to me about his frustrations about the other one.  <br/>\n  They NEED to express that.  Better to me than to friends outside the family, <br/>\n  I think.  Because in this case they have a lot of mutual friends.  It&#39;s to <br/>\n  the benefit of lots of people for them to be sociably at peace.  And it lets <br/>\n  me commiserate with them about the flaws of the sibling and to tell them how <br/>\n  hard it is to be a parent and to love both kids but to see when one is being <br/>\n  hurt without me saying in front of one &quot;Yeah, I know it can be a drag&quot; in <br/>\n  front of the other one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That might not be clear.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;ll say to Marty &quot;Yeah, Kirby sucks, <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t he?&quot;  It&#39;s more like &quot;Marty, I really did want to have you.  I LOVE <br/>\n  you.  And things would be different if you were the oldest.  I&#39;m sorry it <br/>\n  frustrates you.  But I was an oldest and there are disadvantages to that <br/>\n  too.&quot;   It helps the relationship between me and each child for me to be able <br/>\n  to discuss the emotions and reactions in some depth with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On verbal abuse, one thing that has worked here is to remind them that it&#39;s <br/>\n  their own reputation and self/soul that they&#39;re hurting when they&#39;re mean.  <br/>\n  If someone is cruel, it makes him a cruel person.  It might hurt the other <br/>\n  kid too, but it immediately hurts the one who was mean for meanness sake.  <br/>\n  And it disturbs the peace of the others around them.  If two kids are <br/>\n  fighting, the other kid isn&#39;t having peace either.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good luck!  I wish you could get back to San Diego and to the situation you <br/>\n  had before.  I hope things get better for you soon.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
