Unschooling is new to me; but <br/>\nI am very interested and believe this is the direction we&#39;re to go in.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen homeschooling for two years now.  The first year was rough, as I <br/>\nimagine the first year is for anyone.  This year has been much more relaxed <br/>\nand more enjoyable.  We used the Five In a Row unit studies.<br/>\nMy daughter has been an unschooler.  We just didn&#39;t know it.  :)  She&#39;s been <br/>\nable to read since she was 3.  I began teaching my son Kindergarten lessons <br/>\nand she insisted on joining.  So, she&#39;s learned a lot in these past two <br/>\nyears, not being &quot;made to&quot; do ANYTHING.  She&#39;s learned just by her own <br/>\ndesire to know and not be left out of anything.<br/>\nMy son on the other hand, I feel, has been squashed a bit by the pressure <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve put on him from time to time (Bad Mommy!!!) to swallow all the <br/>\ninfo. I was giving him.  He&#39;s doing well.  But, from what I&#39;ve been reading <br/>\nin your e-mails and on a few different websites; he would do much better if <br/>\nwe just relaxed and allowed things to progress at a more natural pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the idea of letting the kids pursue their own interests.<br/>\nMany times in the last couple of years they have interrupted me to ask more <br/>\ndetailed questions and desiring to pursue another subject that tied into the <br/>\none we had been discussing.  Sometimes I was too uptight to allow this <br/>\nnatural progression to run its course.  (Doggone, me!)  But, when I have <br/>\nlightened up and gone with the flow, it&#39;s always been a great delight to me <br/>\nand the kids.  They never cease to amaze me...some of the things they think <br/>\nof.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way...Gus, I really enjoyed what you wrote about your own educational <br/>\nexperiences in free-schooling.  Very interesting!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my little natives are getting restless.  So, I&#39;d better hit the road.  <br/>\nYou all have a wonderful day Friday!!!   :)  :)  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marcy~<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8429,"nextTopicId":8436}}
