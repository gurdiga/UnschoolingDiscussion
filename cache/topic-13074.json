My eldest is an 11 yog. She started<br/>\nreading on her own at 6.5 with no help from me (except daily reading aloud),<br/>\nand has had her nose in a book ever since. My 8 yog is more &quot;normal&quot;. She<br/>\nreads haltingly and shyly. I went over phonics with her, which I didn&#39;t have<br/>\nto do with the eldest. Last night she read a chapter of &quot;Little Bear&quot; to me<br/>\nand was so proud of herself. She has to live in her older sister&#39;s shadow<br/>\nand that&#39;s not easy. My eldest is very dramatic and the center of everything<br/>\nand smart. My 8 yo is just as smart, etc, but she is doomed to be forever 3<br/>\nyears younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago, Tabitha (8) was complaining that she can&#39;t read. I pointed<br/>\nout that I&#39;ve heard her read plenty of times...reading to her little<br/>\nsisters, the cereal box, something on TV, labels....She didn&#39;t count that as<br/>\nreading because it&#39;s not what _Cristina_(11) was reading, some big book with<br/>\nbig words. I had to convince her that what she&#39;s doing is in fact reading<br/>\nand she should be proud of herself and enjoy it. Then I started reading with<br/>\nher without her big sister around. I think that&#39;s really helped. We sit<br/>\ntogether and take turns reading aloud with books I know she can<br/>\nhandle...children&#39;s poetry, short stories. She was really proud of herself<br/>\nwhen she read &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; to her little sister (she determinedly read<br/>\nthe words, not just going by memory...this is really important to her). You<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have a little one for her to read to, would you?  If not in your<br/>\nown family, then a neighbor, a friend you see often? It really boosts<br/>\nTabitha&#39;s confidence when she&#39;s the older, wiser one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe my 8 yo could be e-pals with your 8 yo? She loves writing letters with<br/>\nlots of help from Mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MorelFam@aol.com","from":"MorelFam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QF76-Oxje_tkIi0ZXONgW-bs0Vb2JCnGbriDi2ZfehCGq0ofNVIYEHxjDQFF_MPL2BTunn31hg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"8yog reading struggles","postDate":"968679419","msgId":13074,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwLjZjM2NiZTYuMjZlZTM5ZmJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13077,"prevInTime":13073,"nextInTime":13075,"topicId":13074,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"my dear little 8yog fell apart last night over her not yet being able to read.  i really felt for her, she knows that most little people her age have learned","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1048192600\">my dear little 8yog fell apart last night over her not yet being able to <br/>\nread.  i really felt for her, she knows that most little people her age have <br/>\nlearned to read by now, and she is still struggling.  she doesnt spend much <br/>\ntime trying, mind you, she is very creative and i have been focusing on her <br/>\nother strengths (for myself as much as for her) allowing her to create (do <br/>\ncrafts and artwork) play games and soccer, etc.  i only have one child older <br/>\nthan she, who was reading at around her 7th bday and for the ensuing 3 yrs <br/>\nhas spent many of her waking hours reading.  but up til now, i have seen no <br/>\nreal frustration with herself (8yog)-- i think she thought it would just <br/>\nhappen, and by now, too.  i told her that i believed that it would get easier <br/>\nfor her as she gets older, but if she wanted to speed things up, we could do <br/>\nsome sort of daily session of practice: up to her.  she was in a sad mood, so <br/>\ni didnt get a firm answer... just discouragement, so maybe i&#39;ll ask her <br/>\nagain, or maybe i will leave it alone.  btw, she can read easy words...  any <br/>\nadvice is welcome.<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13084,"nextTopicId":13086}}
