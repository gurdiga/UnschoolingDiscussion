Now I can see that natural acquisition of<br/>\n&gt; math is a totally different process than how math gets taught in<br/>\n&gt; school. I can see huge similarities between naturally acquiring math<br/>\n&gt; and English by using them and learning math and Spanish in school.

But a child can more easily picture<br/>\n&gt; temporarily bumping 4.99 up to 5, subtracting 5 from 6 to get 1. And<br/>\n&gt; then, since 4.99 is further from 6 than 5 (or however they picture it)<br/>\n&gt; knowing that the extra penny we borrowed has to be added to the 1 for<br/>\n&gt; 1.01.

So they really are having a hard time understanding our unschooling choice.  But since its our life they pretty much butt out.  Which is good.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut in your case, its your husband,,,I&#39;m wondering,  Is your family planning on moving back to the UK?    That would be the only reason you would need to worry about that test,  right?   If so, they can prepare for it and that would be a very attainable goal.   Lots of mathmatical brains on our help line in the unschooling.com, right?<br/>\nSecond,  for me with my dh,  I often have to try and put the attention off him so he doesn&#39;t get emotional about it(and stomp away).  Try and sit down with him when you both aren&#39;t emotional and just try and talk about how you feel you are doing what you think is best for your children.  And if they want to be mathematicians they still can be,  they will be able to figure out if that is for them or not.   That&#39;s what is great about unschooling, they have time to figure those things out.   <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know where he is on control,  I know if he really wants them to develop a certain way this is probably going very hard for him.  I know its hard for me when I think about certain things:  like if they don&#39;t want to be musical or if they hated certain things; but I know now, even if they don&#39;t like those things there will be other things that will fill their lives and they will probably be well adjusted adults because of this type of parenting.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps,    is sounds like you are doing great with your kids and I hope you are able to continue your unschooling efforts!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Shyrley &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shyrley.williams@...\">shyrley.williams@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nOnce again I&#39;ve had one of those &#39;not getting anywhere&#39; discussions <br/>\nwith DH about unschooling.<br/>\nActually, it was more to do with maths. He is quite happy to <br/>\n*unchool* everything else, mainly cos he thinks maths is the most <br/>\nimportant thing in the galaxy and everything else isn&#39;t.<br/>\nI would guess that my kids know everything taught at elementary <br/>\nlevel for maths and have learnt this through everyday life. He now <br/>\nwants them to start workbooks for the rest of it. They do not want <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried explaining to him that they only need higher level maths if <br/>\nthey wish to take an exam in the subject or want to become <br/>\nscientists or mathematicians (which is what he is). He then scoffed <br/>\nat my own inability to solve some problem.<br/>\nIt was, if a+b=1000, and a is 150 more than b, what are a and b.<br/>\nI could have done it 15 years ago when I was at school and doing <br/>\nmaths daily.

To get <br/>\nexams he said.<br/>\nTherefore his argument is you need to study maths to pass the <br/>\nexams.<br/>\nNow, he has a small point in that in the UK you need GCSE maths <br/>\n(taken at 16) in order to get nearly every job, even the dead-end <br/>\nones and you will be passed over in favour of another applicant if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t have it.<br/>\nI personally think you shouldn&#39;t take exams if you don&#39;t want too, <br/>\nand if the child wishes to learn maths in order to get that piece of <br/>\npaper then they will do so when the motivation is there. It also <br/>\nseems pointless learning things like quadratic equations. The only <br/>\nuse they serve is too pass that exam. That appears to be their <br/>\nfunction!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel I can elucidate my arguments well in favour of the <br/>\nchildren doing or not doing maths as they wish too. He turns into a <br/>\nlogical mathematician when I try to speak and I feel unable to <br/>\nexplain &#39;feeling&#39; in a way that makes sense. Which is why I&#39;m <br/>\nturning to you lot for help.<br/>\nWhy is it necassary to learn something that you are only learning <br/>\nto get a bit of paper that is irrelevant to everyday life and who they <br/>\nare?<br/>\nHe is starting to push them, especially DD as once upon a time <br/>\nshe was 6 years ahead of her age group in maths and now she is <br/>\nno longer. This is, of course, my fault. For Homeschooling and for <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nwaaaaaaaah<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.
