Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t keep it up on the shelf of her closet like we&#39;d asked and her brother and my friend Laura&#39;s son dropped toys down inside of it and there is a piece of wood splintered off of it. And two broken strings, one of which happened earlier than that incident when Sarah let Gracie grab at the strings. I haven&#39;t been able to replace the strings yet, and I&#39;m hoping that the piece of splintered wood is not going to mean that the guitar is ruined. I was really upset and not at all certain how to handle it, that she wasn&#39;t taking care of it...she suggested that her allowance next month pay for part of the cost of a new one if needed and I said that would be fine. <br/>\n <br/>\nOther than that I think she&#39;s just really enjoying the fact that I&#39;m not asking her to pitch in so much, especially when Paul is gone. This morning, when one of the little ones got yogurt on the living room carpet while I was changing Gracie&#39;s diaper I asked Sarah if she&#39;d get me a wet washcloth so I could wipe it up. I turned around after I finished with Gracie to find that Sarah had a bowl of water and a cloth and was cleaning it up for me!! She&#39;s also offering to help more. <br/>\n <br/>\nShe&#39;s been disappointed that my mother hasn&#39;t written her back yet, but she has also written a letter to Paul&#39;s mom. <br/>\n <br/>\nLogan&#39;s behavior is calming down somewhat too. We&#39;ve been playing HotWheels alot lately, and he picked out a new HotWheels movie DVD that we&#39;ve been talking about. This led to me talking about NASCAR with him, and how he&#39;s related to Fireball Roberts. Watching Pirates of the Caribbean with me got him interested in pirates, and so lately when he isn&#39;t talking about racing cars he&#39;s pretending to be a pirate. He&#39;s also a descendent of Redbeard, so he gets a kick out of that too! His birthday is coming up and I think I&#39;m going to get him a wooden sword and shield to play with. <br/>\n <br/>\nMegan is enjoying her time with the lady from Early Intervention. She is really beginning to talk now, although you still have to listen very closely sometimes to understand her. She&#39;s busy doing things all over the house, but still looks for paper and crayons and asks to be read to.<br/>\n <br/>\nSarah and I are reading &quot;A Little Princess.&quot; We&#39;ve been working on a couple of her Brownie Try-Its badges and towards her goal of a plaque for finishing her third book in AWANAs. Other than that, she&#39;s been spending time reading or on the computer mostly. She decided that she did want to continue with her IEP, and the other day she came home from it with a little book she&#39;d colored about MLK Jr. which led to a couple interesting conversations about history and civil rights and how people act to each other. So we found a book at the library called &quot;Rabble Rousers&quot; about some women from American history who have worked to change things and she has enjoyed that as well. I think it&#39;s kinda cool that she&#39;s beginning to have an interest in history, as I enjoy it as well. <br/>\n <br/>\nGracie is growing like a little weed. She has her first tooth beginning to poke through now. She&#39;s sitting braced on her hands a little longer now, still very talkative, and reaching out like crazy for everything she can. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo that&#39;s what has been going on with them lately...<br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
