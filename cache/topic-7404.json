I too was an only child, and I am somewhat of a loner. I have to have <br/>\ntime alone. Gary, seems to always want company he hates being alone. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow if it&#39;s just a phase he&#39;s going through? or maybe it&#39;s just his <br/>\npersonality. What makes it even harder is that he tends to be shy and <br/>\nself-concious. I tried enrolling him in community programs like karate <br/>\n(which he loves at home) but he wouldn&#39;t participate. I didn&#39;t want to force <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n   I think a pen-pal would be a great idea when he can spell or perhaps they <br/>\ncould dictate short notes. Sorry it takes me so long to respond, but I often <br/>\ndon&#39;t get time to be online until late. I appreciate the feedback though.<br/>\n                              Thanks again<br/>\n                                 Trisha<br/>\n______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"hartshape2@aol.com","from":"hartshape2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"eKKGowwEcc2kFmHbwKzz-jK_GtDxB2zFMdcEE0sHrPHwfhJlQzmmvRDByscxSDYZLRMbwZJy5XnV","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:Only Child","postDate":"954300585","msgId":7404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIuMWZhY2E2Ni4yNjEyZDJhOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7411,"prevInTime":7403,"nextInTime":7405,"topicId":7404,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Michelle and Trisha, I too, have an only child, his name is Payton.

He is 5, and will be 6 at the <br/>\nend of April.  I feel sorry for him when he says he&#39;s lonely.  It&#39;s funny <br/>\nthough, when he does get together with his friends or cousins, all he does is <br/>\nfight!  He doesn&#39;t really have a problem with sharing, but it&#39;s more that he <br/>\nwants to be in control of everything they do.  He&#39;s bossy, and used to having <br/>\nthings his way.  His imaginary friends seem to get along with him just fine <br/>\n;O).  I  think that we have a special bond that may not be there if he had a <br/>\nsibling.  It&#39;s a friendship type bond, we laugh and play games all the time, <br/>\nwe even argue like friends do sometimes, hehe.  As hard as he can be to get <br/>\nalong with at times, I&#39;m thankful he doesn&#39;t have a sibling!  I would much <br/>\nrather be his playmate, it&#39;s very rewarding.  We started homeschooling in <br/>\nDec., that&#39;s when I took him out of ps.  We&#39;re taking it easy and learning <br/>\nall the different ways of hs&#39;ing, and finding out what we both like.<br/>\n<br/>\n       -Tracy-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7395,"nextTopicId":7415}}
