I know I dropped off the face of the earth.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen reading every message that comes through, but couldn&#39;t reply <br/>\nvia my HLSelden@comcast address.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of changes are going on right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe long and short of it is, I came out of the closet, I am getting <br/>\na divorce and I currently have custody of 2 of the 3 kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was not an easy decision, but in the long run, I feel it&#39;s best <br/>\nfor all of us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to stop the posts from coming to that inbox for now as I <br/>\nonly check it once a week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen things settle down, perhaps I&#39;ll return to regular posting.  In <br/>\nthe meantime, the kids are doing well and my roomates are both very <br/>\nsupportive of Unschooling.  They have two children with a &quot;One in a <br/>\nmillion&quot; genetic skin disorder who have teachers come in 3 times a <br/>\nweek.  So we&#39;re thinking of getting them on the unschooling <br/>\nbandwagon and out of the &quot;schoolish&quot; mode.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope you are all well and hope to see you again soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95206,"nextTopicId":95250}}
