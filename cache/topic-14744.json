I don&#39;t spend as much time explaining things to him/ reading to<br/>\nhim etc, as I did with his two older sisters.  But that hasn&#39;t stopped him<br/>\nfrom learning.  Sitting in the car the other day , (kicking my seat, hands<br/>\nflying) he suddenly said, &quot; I know what&#39;s in your body! BOnes!&quot;  He went on<br/>\nto add muscle, blood, heart, and with a few hints, got some other organs<br/>\ntoo.  But it was reassuring that he is learning even though  much of his<br/>\nlife is being dragged around while his older siblings do things.  Also we<br/>\nwere in a multistory carpark the other day and he was running up and down<br/>\nthe stairs reading the numbers on the levels!  I only just realized he even<br/>\nknew his numbers :-)   He NEVER sits still, always jumping around, on the<br/>\nfurniture, me, his baby sister :-/, but I have to remember that  his mind is<br/>\ngoing at the same rate :-)  Not to be outdone, his 6 year old sister said to<br/>\nme &quot;I want a 2p, a2p, and a 1p and another 2p,2p and 1p.&quot;  She wanted to buy<br/>\na 10 pence licorice twist from the shop we were going to. Needless to say,<br/>\nshe got the licorice twist. :-)<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I just wanted to share something I observed my 5yo dd<br/>\n&gt; do today. We had sat down to each lunch together (rare<br/>\n&gt; treat kids are usually much to busy to do so lately)<br/>\n&gt; Dd said ya know 2 and 2 and 1 make 5.  I was floored<br/>\n&gt; wow math. While she was doing this she was rocking<br/>\n&gt; back and forth on her knees.  She was constantly in<br/>\n&gt; motion while describing simple math problems and also<br/>\n&gt; asking me how to spell several words. I also remember<br/>\n&gt; when she wanted me to scribe some stories she made up.<br/>\n&gt;  She recited the stories nad I wrote them down while<br/>\n&gt; she was dancing around the room. She could not sit<br/>\n&gt; still.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Peace,<br/>\n&gt; Samantha<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
