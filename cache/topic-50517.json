He has a plantars wart getting<br/>\n&gt; worse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and worse, after two liquid nitrogen treatments.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know that this sounds really off the wall, but we successfully reated my<br/>\n&gt; son&#39;s plantars warts with banana peels!  I read about banana peels for warts<br/>\n&gt; in _Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child_ by Zand, Walton and Rountree.  I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know if it would work on plantars warts, but it did.  He had a<br/>\n&gt; cluster of 4 on his foot.  Every night, before bed, we would put a fresh<br/>\n&gt; slice of banana peel on the warts, inside side facing the skin, and cover<br/>\n&gt; with a band-aid.  After about a month, it looked like the &quot;seed&quot; of the wart<br/>\n&gt; (the blackisk spots that are usually inside) were at the surface.  We went<br/>\n&gt; swimming for the day, and they came out.  There were little craters where<br/>\n&gt; the warts used to be.  There was no pain and no blood.  In a few weeks the<br/>\n&gt; skin had evened out and you couldn&#39;t tell that there had ever been warts<br/>\n&gt; there!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FWIW,<br/>\n&gt; Marjorie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; P.S.
