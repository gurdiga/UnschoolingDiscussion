Julian sometimes idly ponders whether we actually <br/>\nremember his given name. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is often called Puff, which is short for Juli-Puff, from a long ago <br/>\ninterest in Pokemon, when he gave himself the name. (He also gave Beth the name <br/>\nBeffy-boo when he was little, and she is still his Beffy-Boo. Interestingly, <br/>\nother, close family friends also often call her Beffy-Boo, which is a little odd, I <br/>\nguess. He also gave her the name Fluff. I am rarely anything other than <br/>\nMama.) Other names include Pokey, Bubbles, and other things.  He likes them, but we <br/>\nare all clear that we be careful not call him those things in front of his <br/>\nfriends. (At youth group which Beth advises she called him sweetie once, and <br/>\neveryone just pretended she was talking to the other Youth Adviser LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn utero he was Ignatius.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould we all be taking out Trust funds for future counseling?<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78220,"nextTopicId":78304}}
