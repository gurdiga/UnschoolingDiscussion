Here are some - I have tried to make all decisions without the money","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1780498509\">Hello dear listmates-<br/>\nSo many thoughts have come into my head while following this thread. Here<br/>\nare some -<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to make all decisions without the money factor playing such a<br/>\nhuge part in the dialogue (either an internal dialogue or one with my<br/>\nchildren) . . . If we make our decisions with money being the issue, we<br/>\nusually are acting out of fear that we will never replace that money. We<br/>\neffectively close down our hearts to the process. I doubt anyone here would<br/>\nreally care about a course or sport dropped if they had not plunked down<br/>\ngood, hard-earned money for the activity. (well, maybe some would). I find<br/>\nthe more energy I give to the financial portion of my life, the more<br/>\nelusive the funds become. When I operate out of integrity and clarity as to<br/>\nthe appropriate decision, not focusing on the money aspect, I am always<br/>\nmore content with the outcome, even if it means losing money. Money is just<br/>\nthat - only money. My relationships with my children, and their happiness<br/>\nare way more important to me. And, yes, I have had my children drop<br/>\nactivities they did not enjoy that cost money  and I have left a rental<br/>\nwithout proper notice, gotten a divorce, and, inadvertently, been late<br/>\nand/or not shown up for an appointment! And, on the other end, I have been<br/>\nthe one who has had guests at my B&Bs cancel (sometimes for good reasons,<br/>\nsometimes not) and I have had to make judgement calls on refunding their<br/>\ndeposits or not . .  .so, I&#39;ve had to suck it up sometimes, and so have<br/>\nthey - all depending on the appropriateness of the situation. . . not<br/>\nstrictly on the money aspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of being partners with our children, not adversaries cannot be<br/>\nover-emphasized. Do my children always clean up after eating or after a<br/>\nproject? Absolutely not. Do I ask for their participation? Usually.<br/>\nSometimes it is in my flow to do it without disturbing their flow.<br/>\nExamples: My 20 year old, Sky, just returned from a month-long adventure<br/>\naway (another story!). Obviously, there was mountains of laundry to be<br/>\ndone. Now, while away, he managed to do all his laundry without my help.<br/>\nBut, it was my pleasure to do it for him upon his return. It came time to<br/>\nhang it all on the line (2 loads) - he and I were hanging and talking.<br/>\n&quot;Hey, Sky, I need to get these clothes on the line - let&#39;s keep talking and<br/>\ndo it together.&quot; &quot;Sure, Mom.&quot; Conversation did not miss a beat while we<br/>\nworked side by side, hanging out the clothes. Thirteen year old son, Bay,<br/>\nhas just returned from dirt biking with friends - gear strewn all over the<br/>\nshed, while he tinkers with the what-ja-jicket on his bike. . . &quot;Bay, can<br/>\nyou get this gear out of my way, it is in the middle of the lettuce we just<br/>\nharvested.&quot; &quot;Let me just get this thingie cleaned, Mom, I&#39;ll do it in a<br/>\nbit.&quot; Now, I had the choice then to hurumph and do it myself with attitude,<br/>\nyell at him that it had to be done THEN, because it was my time frame, or<br/>\nwait and let him do it. He did it - right after finishing what he was<br/>\nfocused on at the time. Nell, 16 year old daughter, has a habit of leaving<br/>\nher clothes in a laundry basket at the foot of the stairs (she has the<br/>\nupstairs bedroom). The basket overflows and often takes up the small hall<br/>\nat the stairs often. &quot;Nell, the clothes monster is devoring the hall again,<br/>\nhoney - did you notice?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m on the way out to rehearsal, Mom, I&#39;ll do it<br/>\nwhen I get home.&quot; Next morning, as tired daughter sleeps following a late<br/>\nnight long rehearsal, the clothes are still there, with more added on top.<br/>\nI see them, scoop them up on my way upstairs to my office and fold them,<br/>\nleaving them outside sleeping teenage girl&#39;s door. &quot;Thanks so much, Mom - I<br/>\nwas exhausted when I got home,&quot; comes the sleepy words from Nell with arms<br/>\naround my neck while I work at the computer. The examples abound. I try not<br/>\nto be a dictator around here. That is exhausting. And, yet, things get done<br/>\n- and, yes, I do more than my &quot;share,&quot; I suppose. But, my children are all<br/>\nresponsible, honest, kind and actively involved in the home and all our<br/>\nbusinesses. And no one resents their participation, because it is voluntary<br/>\nand offered and requested with mutual respect. We have no contracts, no<br/>\nchore lists. Just an intense love and clear way of being together.<br/>\n<br/>\nForgive my rambling, but these thoughts have been running through my brain<br/>\nwhile I&#39;ve read this discussion.
