I remember the injustice of it as a grade school <br/>\nchild, sitting at my desk getting my knuckles struck with a ruler because one <br/>\nor two students had been disruptive. <br/>\n       This is not fair to the children of Kulpmont who just want to ride <br/>\ntheir scooters up and down the sidewalks in front of their houses. Yes, there <br/>\nare the foul-mouthed,extreme sporters that can give this group a bad name. <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that most of the people act in such a manner.<br/>\n       In Charlottesville, VA we are lucky enough to have Dave Matthews as a <br/>\nlocal celebrity (not originally from here, but made his name here). Dave was <br/>\ninstrumental in providing funding for a city skatepark. What a great place. <br/>\nMany are hesitant at first (assumed behavior) but quickly find out what a <br/>\ngreat place for all ages. There are rules, and they are enforced (the guys <br/>\nwho run the place are boarders). This seems to be done in such a way that <br/>\nempowers the participants. It is their park; they need to keep things running <br/>\nsmoothly. It&#39;s impressive to watch their responses to new or younger riders <br/>\nor if anyone falls. The group does not tolerate foul language or risky (not <br/>\nmeaning some of the stunts that they try) behavior.<br/>\n       I would personally push this solution (skatepark) plus try to soften <br/>\nthe knee-jerk law (people not engaging in activities that damage property). <br/>\nMaybe enlist the help of the skating community. If they want a park bad <br/>\nenough, they&#39;ll find a way. There has bound to be somebody out there who&#39;s <br/>\nwilling to front money for a skatepark. Find out information from other <br/>\ncities with similar programs. Come armed to meet with the mayor. Let the <br/>\nmayor know that you agree that the skaters should not be destroying property <br/>\nand should respect the other citizens in the community, but what harm is a <br/>\nsmall child riding her scooter do? Then present your proposal with any <br/>\nresearch that you&#39;ve done.<br/>\n       I&#39;m climbing down from my soapbox now. Good luck with all this.<br/>\n       Ginny<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] skateboards and scooters","postDate":"1034296824","msgId":46122,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTgwMWMyNzBiZSRjOWEwMDVjMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4="},"prevInTopic":46121,"nextInTopic":46145,"prevInTime":46121,"nextInTime":46123,"topicId":46098,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They are trying to pass an ordinance <br/>\nwhich would ban skateboards and scooters on all sidewalks and roads, <br/>\neven alleys.  Not just trying to adopt it, they told me on the phone <br/>\nthat it WILL be adopted at the next meeting, November 12.  This would <br/>\nmean my kids can&#39;t ride their scooters on the sidewalk in front of <br/>\nour house.  My kids are upset, especially my daughter.  I think we&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to walk around getting petitions signed to stop it.
