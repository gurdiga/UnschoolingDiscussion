I told the mom that I valued her friendship<br/>\n&gt; but that Aaron was beginning to treat me the same way<br/>\n&gt; and I felt some time apart would be better.  Aaron was<br/>\n&gt; just too young to understand why her child was allowed<br/>\n&gt; to act this way but he wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The mom wasn&#39;t willing to do this, though, so our<br/>\n&gt; friendship died out.  But after a couple months of not<br/>\n&gt; seeing them, and spending time as a family treating<br/>\n&gt; each other with respect and gentleness, my little guy<br/>\n&gt; stopped acting that way too, and would even say, &quot;it<br/>\n&gt; was bad when {child&#39;s name} did that, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I mean is, if other people are treating the mom<br/>\n&gt; badly, and no one is saying, &quot;this is not right, this<br/>\n&gt; must stop NOW,&quot; then the child isn&#39;t going to learn<br/>\n&gt; that either?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; --Susan in VA<br/>\n&gt; WifetoVegman<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for<br/>\nchildren&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the<br/>\nschools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.

If a child picked it up, looked around, and<br/>\n&gt; dropped it to experiment and see if it would break, I&#39;m going to wonder<br/>\nwhy the<br/>\n&gt; child cares so little about me, my things, my time, possibly being<br/>\ninjured, the<br/>\n&gt; expense of a new teapot...  It&#39;s not the one act, it&#39;s the greater<br/>\nsituation<br/>\n&gt; and relationship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Spilling in the van will happen if kids are allowed drinks in there.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; certainly picked toddlers up out of puddles in carseats before. &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to be holier than thou about this.  I&#39;m trying to say that<br/>\n&gt; there are few acts or responses between parents and children, husbands and<br/>\nwives,<br/>\n&gt; any set of people who have an ongoing relationship, which are not<br/>\nindicative<br/>\n&gt; of their mutual trust and cooperation (or lack thereof).  And every<br/>\nresponse<br/>\n&gt; we make to our children will affect the future of that relationship.    If<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; backhanded Holly for dropping a teapot, I could apologize like crazy for a<br/>\nyear,<br/>\n&gt; but it wouldn&#39;t rewind/erase/record for either of us.  Similarly, if I<br/>\n&gt; treated a deliberate act the same way I would treat an accident, even if I<br/>\ndid it<br/>\n&gt; carelessly, Holly would notice.  And IF I carelessly don&#39;t bother to<br/>\n&gt; discriminate between accidents and deliberate messes, it would be because<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t paying<br/>\n&gt; enough attention to *Holly.*  Not to Holly being in the van and whether<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; soda was still in her cup, but to whether Holly was comfortable, happy,<br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; wanted her soda or was through with it, or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Digging through vaccuum bags is something that someone who strongly<br/>\nbelieves<br/>\n&gt; in respecting others would choose to do for someone else, rather than<br/>\n&gt; choosing digging through vaccuum bags as a way to show respect.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just knew how much he loved his Ninja Turtles.

Something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If people change action instead of changing belief, they&#39;ll be awkward at <br/>\n  what they&#39;re doing at best, and eventually will break down in tears or anger <br/>\n  because they have no idea what they&#39;re doing, and it&#39;s not working.<br/>\nI think that actions and beliefs are interrelated and reciprocal rather than cause and effect. I think a person has to change both for real change to come about. One can believe in something, but if her actions do not exemplify those beliefs then the belief is kind of beside the point. Same thing with actions, like Sandra said. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a change in one is enough to initiate a change in the other. I, for one, would rather see someone going through actions awkwardly with the hope that in doing comes believing than to listen to someone preach ideas whose actions have yet to follow. <br/>\n<br/>\nExpressions like &quot;I would never,&quot; &quot;I am unwilling&quot; and &quot;works for us, period&quot; seem extremely rigid to me--far more rigid than I would want anything to be in my life, that&#39;s for sure. I am always looking for better ways to do things, better ways to meet my children&#39;s need and my own needs, better ways to live our lives. Reading around on this list as well as the unschooling.com message boards have offered loads of really useful ideas--some concrete and some abstractly adaptable given further thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all have our boundaries, but to dig one&#39;s feet into the ground over those boundaries without inspection and questioning is doing a disservice both to oneself and those around. I&#39;ve rummaged through many a vacuum bag *after* I heard something go up--not something I do on a regular basis. We&#39;ve had several small toys go up the chute only to be broken beyond repair. We found Aladdin broken in two, and I tried valiantly to melt him back together, but he always broke apart again. We had a &quot;wounded&quot; dinosaur around for quite a while whose vacuum injuries were incorporated into the kids&#39; imaginative play. I don&#39;t make it a habit to dig through my vacuum bags, but I do make it a principle to respect the other members of my family, which sometimes includes digging through vacuum bags. At the same time, the kids have learned the principle that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and maybe it&#39;s better to be careful about picking things up before the vacuum comes out than to risk mom vacuuming them unwittingly. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome boundaries ARE unbreachable, as several people on this list have already said. There is never an excuse for hurting someone or deliberately destroying property--for example, carving initials into a dining room table, like Sandra mentioned. Unschooling isn&#39;t about no boundaries any more than it&#39;s about rigid boundaries.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was struck by Julie&#39;s post about being closed in dark closet and flinging the door open. All I could imagine was how much the light would hurt everyone&#39;s eyes, and how much kinder it would be to let that light in a bit more gradually. Maybe working more gradually, taking one boundary at a time or incremental steps in multiple boundaries would be more gentle. In my experience, extremes are rarely useful--you don&#39;t want to be wholly in the dark, but maybe not flooded by light either, at least not before your eyes have had a chance to adjust a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling, for me, is about looking for a better way, giving up rigid rules and boundaries and embracing, instead, a way of life that is about joy, respect, togetherness, ease and comfort. This doesn&#39;t mean dismissing my needs or comforts, but it does mean re-examining them and being open to other ways of meeting them and new ways of thinking that might not make them seem so important after all.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"Wife2Vegman","from":"Wife2Vegman &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Kids &quot;going insane&quot;","postDate":"1073854117","msgId":88452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTExMjA0ODM3LjY2OTI5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJDMjZFMTU5LjIzMDEzJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":88450,"nextInTopic":88454,"prevInTime":88451,"nextInTime":88453,"topicId":88339,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you think that perhaps also that a child of 3 doesn t understand why the mom lets other people treat her badly but they are supposed to be different?

I was in late pregnancy, uncomfortable, and unable to, and at times unwilling, to spend all day sitting outside in the muggy heat to watch him play. So he&#39;d sneak out. He didn&#39;t understand that the worst hours of the day for the heat weren&#39;t the best times for me to be outside, or that I had to make lunch, or just needed to be inside awhile.

And IF I carelessly don&#39;t bother to <br/>\ndiscriminate between accidents and deliberate messes, it would be because I wasn&#39;t paying <br/>\nenough attention to *Holly.*  Not to Holly being in the van and whether her <br/>\nsoda was still in her cup, but to whether Holly was comfortable, happy, still <br/>\nwanted her soda or was through with it, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Digging through vaccuum bags is something that someone who strongly believes<br/>\nin respecting others would choose to do for someone else, rather than<br/>\nchoosing digging through vaccuum bags as a way to show respect.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just knew how much he loved his Ninja Turtles.

Not because it&#39;s impossible to do, but because I had been so kind and careful with their things that <br/>\nthey were easily and naturally reciprocating.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat a child of 3 will reciprocate or emulate respectful behavior shown to them is absolutely TRUE.  But to expect a child of 3 to know that pouring out a drink into a cup holder is NOT being &quot;kind and careful&quot; is a stretch.  Cause and effect are not entirely clear at this age, nor are consequences, such as messes and how to get something OUT once it&#39;s in - Knots, little things stuck in small-necked bottles, small toys poked into a knothole in paneling because &quot;that is a fairy house,&quot; etc.  To insinuate this is because of disrespect (lack of &quot;kindness and caring&quot;) with children and their posessions, for this one situation, is a reach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to acknowledge my own judgment, I personally would never, ever give a 3-year-old an open soda or drink of any kind in my car.  I DO believe in some rules for little people, with a gradual relaxation as they mature, gain better motor control, and understand cause and effect.  Even now my 5-year-old daughter has a two-hand rule with drinks in the car, and only if we are parked, where we hand her the drink, she takes it with two hands, drinks it with two hands, and then passes it back with two hands.  The only exception is a sippy cup with a small amount in it when on a long trip, and that is always water. My daughter is also not allowed in the front of the vehicle ever, even when parked, as recommended by all child automobile safety guidelines, so there is no danger of releasing the emergency break, etc., an effective preventative for pouring a drink into any electronic equipment, for instance.  As for the adults, we also do not drink in a moving vehicle unless it is a long trip and it is in a closed container (like a travel coffee mug). I am unwilling to accept the mess of liquids and stains in my car or anywhere in my house outside of my kitchen or dining room, so we have rules in place to avoid the problem entirely. This is what works for us, period. As for other folks who advocate more freedom, to each their own.  I unschool; I don&#39;t unparent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also because I know that children do like to try new things, and little holes or cubbies are irresistible, as is any kind of water play.  With an open soda and the boredom that can accompany frequent car trips, to make a judgment on parenting ability because of a child doing this is ludicrous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will not comment on the social worker visits, etc., because I cannot know the situation based on a few posts.  To assume or insinuate there is violence or constant yelling is prejudice, plain and simple, unless, of course, I have missed the posts that detail such behavior, in which case I stand corrected.  I do agree that there are definitely some boundary issues clearly evident in these posts (toxic friends, etc.), and boundary issues always send up red flags for me, but I really don&#39;t feel I have a 3D perspective of the situation from a few e-mails to comment on that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I have a bigger problem with the post asking if a mother has the right to ask her kids to keep their rooms clean when there are snakes and rats/mice nesting in their rooms! A huge part of parenting is providing a safe and harmonious environment for children.  I would expect social workers to be involved in THAT situation, for certain, as children are in danger of rodent-borne illness, snake bite, etc. I actually thought that post was a joke and still am hoping it is! <br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully to all,<br/>\nAmy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 11, 2004 12:32 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Kids &quot;going insane&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 1/10/04 9:29:12 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sherrycook@...\">sherrycook@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; I would have handled it exactly the same way MamaBeth did, without<br/>\n<br/>\n  giving it a second thought.

I used to go through the vacuum <br/>\n  clean bags by dumping them into shallow cardboard boxes before throwing them away <br/>\n  to make sure I didn&#39;t throw away any Ninja Turtle weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And without any prompting or &quot;rules&quot; whatsoever, my kids never made any <br/>\n  purposeful mess in or with my stuff, or in shared places, including cars.

Some holes in vans would cause expensive <br/>\n  damage if a soda was poured into them. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Why would a child pour out a soda anywhere besides the ground or a sink?  My <br/>\n  guesses, which could be wrong, would be out of frustration or spite, out of <br/>\n  some desperation for input or to take attention away from other people.  The <br/>\n  suggestion that it was because the irritating neighbor was there makes sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  But in families in which I&#39;ve seen parents do things I consider shocking, <br/>\n  like putting toys away in a hostile fashion (taking creations apart and slamming <br/>\n  the parts in a box while going on about how the kids should have put things <br/>\n  away themselves) or have been mean to kids or yelled at them until the kids <br/>\n  weren&#39;t listening anymore, or whose kids can say &quot;Mom.   Mom.   Mom?&quot; six times <br/>\n  and get no response, I&#39;ve seen kids do some things to get attention.  Sometimes <br/>\n  physical things to their own bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we say &quot;Oh, good mothering!&quot; about every story that comes here, we could <br/>\n  just replace this list with a webpage on which you write your problem, click <br/>\n  &quot;help&quot; and random messages appear like <br/>\n  &quot;Well you know your kids better than anyone!  Do what feels right.&quot;<br/>\n  or<br/>\n  &quot;Your kids are so lucky to have you as their mom!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  When there&#39;s a mess made here, whoever made it calls for help, and anyone <br/>\n  within range grabs rags or a sponge or paper towels and goes to save the <br/>\n  carpet/table/keyboard or whatever it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marty did make one AMAZING mess when he was two.   He poured out half a <br/>\n  gallon of apple juice.  He didn&#39;t mean to, but he picked up the pitcher, and it was <br/>\n  so heavy all he could do was try to hold it as it slowly spilled on the <br/>\n  floor, and he gave up.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  I went to run him a bath, so I could come back and clean it up.  The bath <br/>\n  water was running.  I went back and he had opened the cardboard can of instant <br/>\n  hot chocolate and spilled THAT, on top of the apple juice, which resists that <br/>\n  powdered milk.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Heck of a mess.  But it was my fault because he was obviously thirsty, and I <br/>\n  had left him and juice too close together.   The doorbell rang and it was a <br/>\n  friend of mine so she sat in the bathroom with Marty while he was in the bathtub <br/>\n  and I cleaned the kitchen floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I&#39;m not trying to say my kids are angels who never did anything wrong, but <br/>\n  the story told seemed to involve an ongoing stress fest, and if extreme <br/>\n  behavior like that is going unnoted and unaddressed, and a social worker is already <br/>\n  involved, it IS a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think all families can unschool.  I think unschooling is a luxury in <br/>\n  times of plenty and health.   I think the principles of attachment parenting <br/>\n  can help in even little ways, under any circumstances, but sometimes things get <br/>\n  very disjointed and it takes some concentrated attention on healing to get <br/>\n  back to a stable starting place.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

He was not really talking at the time.  I took him aside and told him food had to be in it before you could turn it on.  You could not just turn it on when it was empty.  I came home from work a few nights later and the house really stunk.  Frankie had taken a mac and cheese box out of the cabinet and put it in the microwave, turned it on, and dad didn&#39;t notice it until it was really burnt up.  That meant that dad was not seeing to Frankies needs as he must have been hungry and dad wasn&#39;t listening nor   watching him very well either.  I came home from work and have stayed home since.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t drink very many drinks in our new van because we want to keep it nice. That was everyone&#39;s decision.  Frankie did pour sugar in the armrest.  Although I was relieved to find out it wasn&#39;t wet, I did kind of get a little sore about it.  He slammed the fridge door the other night and broke the bottom shelf on the door.  I really let him know that it was broke because he slammed it.  He is being very careful with the fridge door now.  But Caitlin instantly went to trying to fix it the best she could.  It will no longer hold mayonaise or things heavy like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t want to break it, it was a result of a temper tantrum because there was no milk.  We had probably just run out.  I don&#39;t know why he put the sugar in the arm rest.  I told him why I didn&#39;t think it was good and he said oh ok.  And I let him know right then and there that wet things will ruin the  power windows.  Another ok.We go through a lot of that with him.  Some things I think are happening now because he seems to just be coming out of that everything centers around him.  He is 9 now.

Some holes in vans would cause expensive <br/>\ndamage if a soda was poured into them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would a child pour out a soda anywhere besides the ground or a sink?  My <br/>\nguesses, which could be wrong, would be out of frustration or spite, out of <br/>\nsome desperation for input or to take attention away from other people.  The <br/>\nsuggestion that it was because the irritating neighbor was there makes sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in families in which I&#39;ve seen parents do things I consider shocking, <br/>\nlike putting toys away in a hostile fashion (taking creations apart and slamming <br/>\nthe parts in a box while going on about how the kids should have put things <br/>\naway themselves) or have been mean to kids or yelled at them until the kids <br/>\nweren&#39;t listening anymore, or whose kids can say &quot;Mom.   Mom.   Mom?&quot; six times <br/>\nand get no response, I&#39;ve seen kids do some things to get attention.  Sometimes <br/>\nphysical things to their own bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we say &quot;Oh, good mothering!&quot; about every story that comes here, we could <br/>\njust replace this list with a webpage on which you write your problem, click <br/>\n&quot;help&quot; and random messages appear like <br/>\n&quot;Well you know your kids better than anyone!  Do what feels right.&quot;<br/>\nor<br/>\n&quot;Your kids are so lucky to have you as their mom!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there&#39;s a mess made here, whoever made it calls for help, and anyone <br/>\nwithin range grabs rags or a sponge or paper towels and goes to save the <br/>\ncarpet/table/keyboard or whatever it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty did make one AMAZING mess when he was two.   He poured out half a <br/>\ngallon of apple juice.  He didn&#39;t mean to, but he picked up the pitcher, and it was <br/>\nso heavy all he could do was try to hold it as it slowly spilled on the <br/>\nfloor, and he gave up.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to run him a bath, so I could come back and clean it up.  The bath <br/>\nwater was running.  I went back and he had opened the cardboard can of instant <br/>\nhot chocolate and spilled THAT, on top of the apple juice, which resists that <br/>\npowdered milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck of a mess.  But it was my fault because he was obviously thirsty, and I <br/>\nhad left him and juice too close together.   The doorbell rang and it was a <br/>\nfriend of mine so she sat in the bathroom with Marty while he was in the bathtub <br/>\nand I cleaned the kitchen floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not trying to say my kids are angels who never did anything wrong, but <br/>\nthe story told seemed to involve an ongoing stress fest, and if extreme <br/>\nbehavior like that is going unnoted and unaddressed, and a social worker is already <br/>\ninvolved, it IS a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think all families can unschool.

You&#39;d probably unsubscribe immediately and go on to tell your friends about the &quot;crazy unschoolers and their wild kids.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Mamabeth, I&#39;m not saying this to pick on you, but rather because I am concerned enough about your situation that I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to say this that you&#39;ll &quot;hear&quot; and not dismiss as overly critical: If you have a social worker coming to your home on a regular basis, and on her clipboard there&#39;s a paper saying, &quot;history of negligence&quot;, if she walks into a home where it&#39;s ok for your daughter to write on the wall, graffiti-style, and ok for your son to dump a can of soda, she&#39;s not likely to think, &quot;What a free-spirited family!&quot; but rather to note it as further evidence of neglect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you&#39;re a bad mother; I can tell you care deeply about your children.  But now, with the social worker examining the situation, it might not be the best time to say that you don&#39;t have rules in your household and the kids can do whatever they want.  And if this social worker has the power to insist that you put your children in school, then if you&#39;re committed to unschooling, you might want to set up more rules than you&#39;d like right now to achieve the larger goal of keeping the kids at home rather than school.  Because if you insist on no rules and it looks like continued negligence, you might lose the option to unschool, and sending them to school would be worse than telling them, &quot;Don&#39;t write on the wall&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t dump your drink.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Ideally, of COURSE, we&#39;d do it sweetly and<br/>\n&gt; brilliantly - figure out that a soothing bubble bath is just what the<br/>\n&gt; child needs - or a bowl of hot soup or a backrub or whatever -- but in<br/>\n&gt; real life there are times we just say, as you described, Krisula, &quot;Be<br/>\n&gt; more quiet or go in the other room.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For a kid who is overstimulated - being too rough - being rude or mean<br/>\n&gt; to the rest of the family - asking them to &quot;Go in the other room and<br/>\n&gt; get yourself calmed down before you come back,&quot; is not a punishment -<br/>\n&gt; it is an attempt by the parent to protect other family members and let<br/>\n&gt; the child know that he/she is being rude and an opportunity for the<br/>\n&gt; child to get in control of him/herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Destructive behaviour can come in many shapes or forms.

Suppose you were","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-462471437\">I&#39;ve been thinking about what Sandra said about kids purposely dumping a soda from the point of view of someone new to unschooling.  Suppose you were interested in unschooling and you signed up and got the impression that unschooling meant never telling kids anything and letting them do absolutely whatever they want, to the extent of purposefully destroying property.  You&#39;d probably unsubscribe immediately and go on to tell your friends about the &quot;crazy unschoolers and their wild kids.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Mamabeth, I&#39;m not saying this to pick on you, but rather because I am concerned enough about your situation that I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to say this that you&#39;ll &quot;hear&quot; and not dismiss as overly critical: If you have a social worker coming to your home on a regular basis, and on her clipboard there&#39;s a paper saying, &quot;history of negligence&quot;, if she walks into a home where it&#39;s ok for your daughter to write on the wall, graffiti-style, and ok for your son to dump a can of soda, she&#39;s not likely to think, &quot;What a free-spirited family!&quot; but rather to note it as further evidence of neglect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you&#39;re a bad mother; I can tell you care deeply about your children.  But now, with the social worker examining the situation, it might not be the best time to say that you don&#39;t have rules in your household and the kids can do whatever they want.  And if this social worker has the power to insist that you put your children in school, then if you&#39;re committed to unschooling, you might want to set up more rules than you&#39;d like right now to achieve the larger goal of keeping the kids at home rather than school.  Because if you insist on no rules and it looks like continued negligence, you might lose the option to unschool, and sending them to school would be worse than telling them, &quot;Don&#39;t write on the wall&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t dump your drink.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
