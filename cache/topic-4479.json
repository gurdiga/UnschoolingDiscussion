I am <br/>\n&gt; &gt; seriously considering signing off completely. Have any of you felt this way? <br/>\n&gt; &gt; If so hoe do you handle it?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Sometimes I have a lot of time for e-mail and sometimes I&#39;m really <br/>\n limited so...................<br/>\n I either delete a lot when I&#39;m busy,  or file messages in an &quot;unread&quot; <br/>\n file to read at a later date.  Sorting the messages by subject makes <br/>\n it easy to catch any that I want to read right away.  I think,  like <br/>\n anything else in life,  it&#39;s a constant balancing act.  I figure out <br/>\n what I can handle and go from there.  Some people can handle several <br/>\n busy lists.
