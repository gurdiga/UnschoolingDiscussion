She has never loved math but<br/>\nshe understands it and her process is solid. I have emphasized with her<br/>\nover and over how she  is learning at her own pace (at par with her school<br/>\nmate pals) and that the multiplication will come. She knows most of the<br/>\ntables but I have never asked her to memorize them. However, yesterday she<br/>\nburst into tears and said, &quot;Enough of the understanding math... I just want<br/>\nto know all my multiplication tables. All my friends in school know them<br/>\noff the top of their heads. &quot;  This came after struggling with a<br/>\nmultiplication problem.  <br/>\nSo, I am going to help her memorize the multiplication tables. Gag...  But<br/>\nthis is obviously something that is important to her...right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my struggle is with keeping up with the math. I do slip back to<br/>\nworkbooks and texts because I have a comfort zone working with them. I do<br/>\nsee how mundane and unreal they become, however this morning I am wondering<br/>\nif I am doing enough with my daughters along the lines of math and etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nPensive Brooke<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;.

I realize there are many ways to develop your brain,  but it<br/>\n&gt;seems memorizing something is one of them.  Those in drama do this to learn<br/>\n&gt;their part.
