Than at <br/>\nthe end there was a list of discussion questions, I guess for readers&#39; groups <br/>\nthat might not be able to think of good questions on their own or something.  <br/>\nSome of them were reasonable questions.  Some were &quot;DUH!&quot; (no one could have <br/>\ncome to the end without having thought those things), and some were not good <br/>\nquestions.   Just like the questions after a short story in a high school <br/>\nliterature book.  And for me, that cast a sad pall over what had been a great <br/>\nnovel.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would also have enabled book club members who didn&#39;t really read the whole <br/>\nbook to skim for the passages which would be discussed at the club meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wonder to what extent readers&#39; clubs are fulfilling needs in the members <br/>\nto continue what they did well in school, or to finally do well what they <br/>\nfailed to accomplish well in school, or to use other people to pressure them <br/>\ninto reading since they were &quot;trained&quot; to read only with deadlines and <br/>\nreporting requirements and tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36943,"nextTopicId":36809}}
