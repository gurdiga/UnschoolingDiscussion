I wrote last week on Tuesday night (actually Wed, <br/>\nbecause it was well past midnight) under the subject &quot;New to <br/>\nunschooling...HELP.&quot;   I discussed my oldest son (9yrs) and his <br/>\nadjustment to unschooling.  He was angry that I was not &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>\nhim and seemed to be vegging in front of the TV festering in his <br/>\nfrustrations.  Well, for the most part I let him...offered to play <br/>\ngames with him, took the family on a bus trip (my car is broken down) <br/>\nto go bowling, visited the library, etc... Friday we spent the day <br/>\nmostly at home and he barely turned the TV on at all.  He set up the <br/>\nliving room as a store and played with his sister for hours. Making <br/>\nchange with play money and all.  Do I feel good right now? Heck <br/>\nyeah!!  Do I expect this to occur everyday....well, one must be <br/>\nrealistic.  <br/>\n       Someone wrote that if everytime your child were to sit in <br/>\nfront of the TV you were to constantly interrupt with invitations for <br/>\nhim to cook with you, go for a walk, or do a craft, it is probable <br/>\nthat the child would see right through your motivations. My oldest <br/>\nson would. My other two are the type that would jump up to join me. <br/>\nAll children are different. <br/>\n       I don&#39;t really agree with some of your feelings that a <br/>\nunschooling moms role is to constantly involve her children in <br/>\ncountless excursions and fun activities.  Children need to be left <br/>\nalone as well. They need to use their own abilities to entertain <br/>\nthemselves.  Distractions and entertainment come in many forms. While <br/>\na mother who keeps her kids busy with activity is using a more <br/>\nsensory approach then TV or video games it is ultimately steering <br/>\nchildren in the mothers chosen direction.  I am definitely not saying <br/>\nthat you should sit around the house all day but I also don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat running all over the place trying to keep kids &quot;busy&quot; is the <br/>\nanswer.
