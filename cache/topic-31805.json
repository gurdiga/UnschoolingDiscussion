Oh yeah.....it was a<br/>\ndescription of a PBS show about the teenage brain.  I missed the first part,<br/>\nbut part 2 is on tonight.<br/>\n    The article attracted my attention in part because the show will feature<br/>\na local cartoonist....Jim Borgman.....I adore his work!   He draws for the<br/>\ncomic strip Zits.... the only comic my dh will read!<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;ll give you an example from home.  Rachel has depression problems<br/>\n&gt; and is on Prozac.  She knows she feels better when her sleep schedule<br/>\n&gt; is patterned so that she is up during the day.  She also knows that<br/>\n&gt; if she hangs out on the computer at night starts watching tv at<br/>\n&gt; night, she will be up all night.  It&#39;s a pattern, she knows it, I<br/>\n&gt; know it, we all know it.  The last time she got into a bad pattern,<br/>\n&gt; she wuld get royally mad if we left the house without her.  We had<br/>\n&gt; numerous discussions about the fact that it is like waking the dead<br/>\n&gt; to get her up and we would give her one wake-up call and then be on<br/>\n&gt; our way from then on.  She now understands it is her decision to get<br/>\n&gt; out of or stay in bed and has stopped going off on us if we leave<br/>\n&gt; without her.<br/>\n&gt; In other words, it&#39;s her choice.  It does not matter if I want her up<br/>\n&gt; in the morning or not.  But she had to learn to live peacefully with<br/>\n&gt; the consequences too.  When she was going off on us for leaving her<br/>\n&gt; at home, I started making her get up when we went out.  When she<br/>\n&gt; decided to stop getting mad at us, I started leaving her alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bridget<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31765,"nextTopicId":31229}}
