Mine will be 6 next month.  I would like to hear about <br/>\nsome of your new ideas for resources.  You can email me personally if you&#39;d <br/>\nrather, but I&#39;m others would like to hear, too.  What I did was buy one of <br/>\nthose plastic stands that has 3 big drawers.  One drawer has markers, <br/>\ncrayons, chalk, and other writing tools.  The next drawer has all different <br/>\ntypes of paper.  Then there&#39;s one with all sorts of &quot;making materials&quot; like <br/>\nthose little pom pom balls, pipe cleaners, googly eyes, even bags of clay, <br/>\nand playdough.  I have it in the kitchen next to the table where he can <br/>\naccess it and go for it whenever he feels the need.  Yesterday I had to buy <br/>\nanother one.  It will be great, as we needed a seperate drawer just for his <br/>\npaints.  These drawers are pretty big.  It cost me about $18, it even comes <br/>\nwith wheels you can attatch.  Hey, you could even roll it outside on a nice <br/>\nday!  He&#39;s got a Little Tykes small table that we often take outside in the <br/>\nsummer for playdough (no clean-up).  Just wanted to share an idea.  :O)<br/>\n<br/>\n   -Tracy-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan","from":"susan &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nQqVx0yCPpKC87jMpLbNw6Zq8aKpJ8sSXWOzPt2qFsK43rKU_MHWkDxdcQly4YHkOPLd9KdhSk6gmouWBK66uhc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need for advice-Doing Alright!!","postDate":"954197376","msgId":7356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4REZFNTdBLjIzRjcxRTNAZmxhc2gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWJmOTg1YSQ5NTIzZTc2MCRiNTdhZDljZUB0c3VnYT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7376,"prevInTime":7355,"nextInTime":7357,"topicId":7356,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi michelle, it s really nice to hear that you moved right on through and the ideas and changes you talked about sound great. -susan austin,tx unity through","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1440399643\">\n<html>\n \nhi michelle,\n<p>it&#39;s really nice to hear that you moved right on through and the ideas\nand changes you talked about sound great.\n<p>-susan\n<br>austin,tx\n<br>&#39;unity through diversity&#39;\n<p>&quot;Michelle L.
