(did that make any<br/>\nsense?)  They would be attending school with all their old friends and<br/>\nwanted to go.  Very sadly, I agreed.  My son even had to get shots to go and<br/>\nstill wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school was kind of jerky about it, very clearly assuming that the kids<br/>\nwould be way behind (in 2nd grade and K, if you can believe that).  They<br/>\ntested the 2nd grader and she did fine.  The kids had a ball....initially.<br/>\nThey bounced right out of bed....initially.  They even did their<br/>\nhomework....initially.  Within 3 months, they both asked to come home and<br/>\nhave never mentioned going to school again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24814,"nextTopicId":24793}}
