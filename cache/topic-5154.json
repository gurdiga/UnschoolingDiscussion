(Dec. 6) - Four students at a rural middle school were <br/>\nshot this morning and a middle school student was taken into custody.<br/>\nSuperintendent Steve Wilmoth said students were gathered outside before the 8 <br/>\na.m. start of classes. &#39;&#39;Another student just walked up and opened fire on <br/>\nthem,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;From what I know at this point it seems to be a random <br/>\nthing.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother child in yet another school harming friends. What is happening to <br/>\nchildren in our nation? I am quickly forming the thoughts of prayer for <br/>\neveryone involved. These children will live with the horror of this event for <br/>\nall their days. My thoughts are racing and the question &quot;Why?&quot; stands out. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of these children will be mentally damaged? For as I think about <br/>\nthis (another shooting in our public schools), I think of my brother. A man <br/>\nwho spent time fighting in Viet Nam. Will these children relive this tragedy <br/>\nmuch like he relives the forest? I am truly disheartened and ill at the <br/>\nthoughts of it all.<br/>\nstephanie coomer<br/>\n<br/>\nMay the love of God surround you this season!<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nStephanie���<br/>\nGift of Strangers - a stranger is a friend<br/>\nyou have yet to meet. <br/>\nHow many strangers have you befriended today?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5141,"nextTopicId":5140}}
