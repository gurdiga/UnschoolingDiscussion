She was a teacher.  I&#39;m going to tie up my husband and read this to him!   Although he might like that&lt;gg&gt;, just kidding.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI especially like the fact that her son went to The Language Villages here in Bemidji, MN.   Christian, the son, went to Waldsee, German Village.  A good friend of mine is one of the directors out there.   The Villages are just up the road from me, about 5 miles and my father-in-law was the director of those for about 20 years.  I have alot of connections there,  I love Skogfjorden, Norwegian Village.  Because of my Norwegian blood.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, immersion learning is very unschoolish,  immersion is how they learn at the villages.  No books, just activities.  So my fil is really understanding our unschooling approach.      He came to me a few weeks ago and asked why he saw the light go out in kids eyes around 3rd grade.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what he saw when he was a teacher,  30 years ago.  I informed him the light went out in his grandson&#39;s eyes in preschool!   Hmmmmmm..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  thought I&#39;d share,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is wondering about the language villages,   I&#39;ll ramble more if you want.   They are a great experience for kids.
