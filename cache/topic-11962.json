I was surprized to see it,<br/>\nmust have accidentally clicked on Unschooling when sending it to<br/>\nTiffany.  I must make a point of reading one Unschooling a day.  It<br/>\nalways gives me good ideas.  I especially liked the one from the person<br/>\nwith the six year old, I&#39;m going to check into Mad Libs.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nnoticing his progression in letter, words and numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres a story about numbers.  We were taking a bath.  He tells me I<br/>\nreally don&#39;t know Math that well.  I tell him we have 5 minutes left in<br/>\nour bath.  Then I tell him in a bit that 2 minutes have gone by and we<br/>\nhave to get out soon.  He says no, we don&#39;t have to get out soon we have<br/>\n3 minutes left.  (he did this in his head).  He&#39;s doing fine.  I use<br/>\nthis story when folks ask how he is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11957,"nextTopicId":11963}}
