So if Mom doesn&#39;t feel taken advantage of in the first place, <br/>\nshe won&#39;t feel like spouting these snappy little cliches we&#39;ve been <br/>\ndiscussing, right? <br/>\n<br/>\n       If this is right, then the ideal unschooler response wouldn&#39;t be just <br/>\nto tell Mom she&#39;s wrong to say it even when she honestly feels it, but also to <br/>\nhelp her see (with clear eyes) and feel good about the often-unreasonable -- <br/>\nbut really lovable! -- people with whom she lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n       Which is what the list is trying to do?  :)  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;a taste of his own medicine&quot;andother\tcruel ideas","postDate":"1084791223","msgId":94168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDQ0UxMUY3LjI2RjQxJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDUwMWM0M2JjOCRjYWZjY2U0MCRmMmJkYjFkOEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":94162,"nextInTopic":94173,"prevInTime":94167,"nextInTime":94169,"topicId":94141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Or at<br/>\nleast not in a manner that made me remember them.  I truly don&#39;t remember my<br/>\nparents (who have been married since 1959) ever making comments to put me or<br/>\nmy siblings down.  Doesn&#39;t mean they were always sweet love and pink clouds<br/>\nwith us but that we had a realistic view of their world and never questioned<br/>\ntheir devotion to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad was a peace officer and always worked at least 2 jobs, sometimes 3.<br/>\nMy mom always worked as well. It was obvious to all of us that if or when<br/>\nthey were unable to do something for us they just didn&#39;t have the time or<br/>\nenergy or both.  I just can&#39;t imagine myself or my siblings or any of my<br/>\nkids getting bummed at someone who spent the time and effort to make me a<br/>\ndinner simply because I wanted them to make me something else and they were<br/>\ntoo tired to want to do it. To be honest, it seems tremendously selfish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in my 40 years, this is my experience of most of the families I know.<br/>\nSure, I also know some really crappy parents and I know some really crappy<br/>\nkids but for the most part, the people I know have very loving dynamics in<br/>\nthier families and understand that use of a cliche doesn&#39;t indicate a lack<br/>\nof love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked with my dh about this because I thought perhaps I just had a wierd<br/>\nfamily.  He laughed and said that he had used the phrase on his mom at the<br/>\nlast family reunion (we grew up on opposite ends of the country) in a joking<br/>\nmanner after spending time cooking breakfast while his mom was sleeping and<br/>\nher wanting something just as he was starting to clean up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I know it doesn&#39;t have to do with where you grew up, or in which<br/>\nparticular family you grew up.  I now know of at least 2 situations in which<br/>\nthat phrase was used in a manner that wasn&#39;t intended to put anyone down but<br/>\nrather in a joking manner.  I think it has a lot to do with how people grow<br/>\nup, whether they feel overall that they were loved or not, which was my<br/>\noriginal post on this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think perhaps it is just a difference in temperament or something.

And in all those years I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; never heard any of those phrases used other times (unless maybe by a drunk<br/>\ntrying<br/>\n&gt; to start a fight, in the cases of things like &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You are so full of yourself,&quot; but they&#39;re usually reserved for the<br/>\nputting<br/>\n&gt; down of children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I defend my statement by giving my reasons for making the statement in<br/>\n&gt; public where I knew I could be called on to defend it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And if anyone wants to refute it, they need to have more than just &quot;I<br/>\ndoubt<br/>\n&gt; it&quot; or &quot;but if they did,&quot; I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie, I know you can come up with good, clear arguments, so I&#39;m confused<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; to why you&#39;re clinging to your defense of the possibility (or more) of the<br/>\n&gt; casual use of such exact word, exact tone of voice phrases in ways that<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; nothing to do with their broad and longterm use in kid put-down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did you grow up without ever hearing those phrases used to or of you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If so, I think you&#39;re in a small minority.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think your mom had at least one of them used on her, and she&#39;s used it<br/>\n&gt; again, at least on your dad.  I doubt that if she heard it as a kid she<br/>\ngot a<br/>\n&gt; smile and a kiss on the head after.   And if she&#39;s been married to your<br/>\ndad long,<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t she know what food he likes or will eat?  And isn&#39;t the purpose<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; food prep and presentation more than just &quot;I did it, eat it or not?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Those questions move it on to another topic, I suppose, or maybe straight<br/>\n&gt; back to the original.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Feeding families is more than cooking one meal because it&#39;s 5:00.   That&#39;s<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; rule kind of thing, a checklist.  &quot;I&#39;m the mom, it&#39;s dinner time, I<br/>\ncooked,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m done.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But the principle is that people need to eat and if they go to bed hungry<br/>\n&gt; they might not sleep well, and both food and sleep are important.  So if<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; important, the mom needs to plan life so that somehow, by whatever<br/>\nnecessary<br/>\n&gt; combination of factors, everyone has enough food he or she will eat that<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; principle is fulfilled.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t sweep well, and I don&#39;t like sweeping.  If I have a list that says<br/>\n&gt; &quot;sweep&quot; and I sweep, I can cross that off.  If the list says or means &quot;get<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; floor clean&quot; it&#39;s going to be more work before I can cross it off, but the<br/>\nreal<br/>\n&gt; purpose is &quot;get the floor clean&quot; not &quot;move broom all over floor and call<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; good.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think school and chores are a combination that make lots of adults<br/>\n&gt; (millions and millions of adults) think that if they moved their eyes<br/>\nacross something<br/>\n&gt; they read it; if they cast their eyes toward a person or a kid-project,<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; looked at it; if music played and their ears perceived it they listened to<br/>\nit.<br/>\n&gt;  But the person asking them to read, or look, or listen wasn&#39;t asking them<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; indicate whether their nervous system registered stimuli.   They really<br/>\n&gt; wanted attentive, thoughtful interaction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When someone wants to eat, they often want attentive, thoughtful<br/>\ninteraction<br/>\n&gt; (and food).  It doesn&#39;t happen every time.  One of our biggest fallbacks<br/>\nis an<br/>\n&gt; extra freezer with kid-favorite microwave stuff.  And I got really grumpy<br/>\n&gt; earlier because Keith ate my cheeseburger and left me with the no cheese,<br/>\ngreen<br/>\n&gt; chile that he had ordered.  Life&#39;s not perfect.   But it&#39;s a step in the<br/>\nright<br/>\n&gt; direction for people to honestly think and honestly look and carefully<br/>\nspeak<br/>\n&gt; instead of reciting phrases from another set of principles.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

You&#39;re not the only one! My mother had a whole littany of names for<br/>\nme, none of which were very nice, made me feel loved or remotely good about<br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalamity Jane, Mrs. Magoo (Mr. Magoo, for those who recall, was blind,<br/>\nbumbling and often ran into things), Linda Lightfoot, etc. The last one has<br/>\nalways been a major point of contention between the two of us. My mother<br/>\nwent to a two year college for her associate&#39;s degree in home-ec, though it<br/>\nwas basically finishing school. She always corrected my grammar (to this<br/>\nday, I growl back that I&#39;m using the vernacular), insisted upon Emily Post<br/>\nmanners and used to flick my elbows off the table, and used to walk so<br/>\nquietly that she could sneak up on my pretty much any time of the day and<br/>\njust start talking right behind me. Being a person who startles very easily,<br/>\nthis has *always* majorly bugged me, and she has never done anything to give<br/>\nme advance warning of her approach but instead implies that I&#39;m heavy-footed<br/>\nand oafish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really interesting thing about these nicknames in retrospect is that I&#39;m<br/>\nactually a quite athletic and coordinated person, so they do little to<br/>\nreflect any reality about me. They certainly wouldn&#39;t be any better if they<br/>\n*did* reflect reality, but it seems telling that she needed to put me down<br/>\nfor the sake of putting me down. She&#39;s an extremely negative and selfish<br/>\nperson, and she&#39;s probably been the single greatest influence in my own<br/>\nmothering--it&#39;s just too bad that it couldn&#39;t have been in a good way. I<br/>\naccepted a long time ago that I couldn&#39;t change her, but my children will<br/>\n*never* have a mother like she was--that much I do have contol over. I work<br/>\nevery day to ensure that my kids have the best mom they can have, and I&#39;m<br/>\ngrateful to have support for that here on this list and irl with LLL, AP and<br/>\nunschooling friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;a taste of his own medicine&quot;andother cruel ideas","postDate":"1084747452","msgId":94149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkNS4yMTcxNjllMS4yZGQ5NDhiY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94148,"nextInTopic":94153,"prevInTime":94148,"nextInTime":94150,"topicId":94141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/16/04 4:29:17 PM, dezigna@comcast.net writes:  I heard it for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-527982980\">In a message dated 5/16/04 4:29:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Children do not have a sense of that cultural history of the phrase.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard it for years before I found out what it literally meant.

And in all those years I have <br/>\nnever heard any of those phrases used other times (unless maybe by a drunk trying <br/>\nto start a fight, in the cases of things like &quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;You are so full of yourself,&quot; but they&#39;re usually reserved for the putting <br/>\ndown of children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I defend my statement by giving my reasons for making the statement in <br/>\npublic where I knew I could be called on to defend it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if anyone wants to refute it, they need to have more than just &quot;I doubt <br/>\nit&quot; or &quot;but if they did,&quot; I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, I know you can come up with good, clear arguments, so I&#39;m confused as <br/>\nto why you&#39;re clinging to your defense of the possibility (or more) of the <br/>\ncasual use of such exact word, exact tone of voice phrases in ways that have <br/>\nnothing to do with their broad and longterm use in kid put-down.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you grow up without ever hearing those phrases used to or of you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, I think you&#39;re in a small minority.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your mom had at least one of them used on her, and she&#39;s used it <br/>\nagain, at least on your dad.  I doubt that if she heard it as a kid she got a <br/>\nsmile and a kiss on the head after.   And if she&#39;s been married to your dad long, <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t she know what food he likes or will eat?  And isn&#39;t the purpose of <br/>\nfood prep and presentation more than just &quot;I did it, eat it or not?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose questions move it on to another topic, I suppose, or maybe straight <br/>\nback to the original.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFeeding families is more than cooking one meal because it&#39;s 5:00.   That&#39;s a <br/>\nrule kind of thing, a checklist.  &quot;I&#39;m the mom, it&#39;s dinner time, I cooked, <br/>\nI&#39;m done.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the principle is that people need to eat and if they go to bed hungry <br/>\nthey might not sleep well, and both food and sleep are important.  So if it&#39;s <br/>\nimportant, the mom needs to plan life so that somehow, by whatever necessary <br/>\ncombination of factors, everyone has enough food he or she will eat that the <br/>\nprinciple is fulfilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t sweep well, and I don&#39;t like sweeping.  If I have a list that says <br/>\n&quot;sweep&quot; and I sweep, I can cross that off.  If the list says or means &quot;get the <br/>\nfloor clean&quot; it&#39;s going to be more work before I can cross it off, but the real <br/>\npurpose is &quot;get the floor clean&quot; not &quot;move broom all over floor and call it <br/>\ngood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think school and chores are a combination that make lots of adults <br/>\n(millions and millions of adults) think that if they moved their eyes across something <br/>\nthey read it; if they cast their eyes toward a person or a kid-project, they <br/>\nlooked at it; if music played and their ears perceived it they listened to it. <br/>\n But the person asking them to read, or look, or listen wasn&#39;t asking them to <br/>\nindicate whether their nervous system registered stimuli.   They really <br/>\nwanted attentive, thoughtful interaction.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone wants to eat, they often want attentive, thoughtful interaction <br/>\n(and food).  It doesn&#39;t happen every time.  One of our biggest fallbacks is an <br/>\nextra freezer with kid-favorite microwave stuff.  And I got really grumpy <br/>\nearlier because Keith ate my cheeseburger and left me with the no cheese, green <br/>\nchile that he had ordered.  Life&#39;s not perfect.   But it&#39;s a step in the right <br/>\ndirection for people to honestly think and honestly look and carefully speak <br/>\ninstead of reciting phrases from another set of principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;a taste of his own medicine&quot;andother cruel ideas","postDate":"1084746418","msgId":94147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWM0M2I4YiRhMDg3YmUwMCRiZmJkYjFkOEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":94145,"nextInTopic":94148,"prevInTime":94146,"nextInTime":94148,"topicId":94141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1676105387\">&lt;&lt;My mom has said it on several occassions to my dad.

Unless you are talking to someone who actually works in a<br/>\nrestaurant, it is a euphemism with a number of levels of meaning: &quot;you are<br/>\nperfectly capable of doing it yourself&quot; and &quot;I am too<br/>\nbusy/overwhelmed/tired/unwilling right now&quot; and &quot;you have crossed the line<br/>\ninto too demanding&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut those are just the top layers of meaning. There is a lot more in that<br/>\nphrase - in some cases, especially when said to children &quot;Independence and<br/>\nself sufficiency is to be valued and encouraged (or forced on them if they<br/>\naren&#39;t doing it themselves)&quot; and &quot;my time and energy is for more important<br/>\nthings than you&quot; and &quot;you are less important than I am&quot; and &quot;revenge is<br/>\nsweet&quot; and &quot;no-one does stuff for me and I&#39;m neglected&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read the above story and wonder what your father actually felt at those<br/>\nmoments, and if they were at all predictable. Maybe he felt loved. Maybe he<br/>\nfelt confused, &quot;What&#39;s different about this request compared to yesterday<br/>\nwhen she was perfectly happy to get me a sandwich?&quot;. Maybe he felt sheepish,<br/>\n&quot;well it was worth a try.&quot; What if your father felt sad? &quot;Gee, I&#39;d hoped she<br/>\nwould show love by doing something totally unnecessary for me&quot; or &quot;Why is<br/>\nshe laughing at me asking for something&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mention these possibilities not to criticize, but to try to come back to<br/>\n*children* in this discussion. How might using such a phrase make your child<br/>\nfeel? <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren do not have a sense of that cultural history of the phrase. It is<br/>\ntough for little children to know where the &quot;uncrossable line into too<br/>\ndemanding&quot; is on any given day. To them it comes out of nowhere, and it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t surprise me if they felt all the force of &quot;you are less important<br/>\nthan I am&quot; as the primary meaning of it, no matter how cheerily it is said. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times when I have felt irritated by numerous requests from<br/>\neither James (dh) or Jayn. It is when I am feeling negative emotions that I<br/>\ntry even harder to use simple factual language - this list has taught me<br/>\nthat over the last couple of years. Loaded emotional terms or cultural<br/>\nshorthand are less useful than saying, &quot;I&#39;m a little tired right now. Will<br/>\nyou get it instead?&quot; or &quot;can I do that later?&quot; or &quot;I need some help.
