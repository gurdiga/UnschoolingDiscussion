One of the things we did was to sit quietly with eyes <br/>\nclosed and re-examine the most recent blow-up. I would walk them <br/>\nthrough the images, the body sensations, the words and events, alert to <br/>\nthe trigger points that bubbled over into the outburst of anger. <br/>\nUsually most of us feel a &quot;point of no return&quot; with anger where it <br/>\nsimply seems to &quot;take us over.&quot; And yet, had a girlfriend been in the <br/>\nroom at the time of the event, usually we would be magically able to <br/>\nhold back from spilling over. So it is possible to do something besides <br/>\nthe pattern of anger - we just need some kind of witness or thwarting <br/>\nmechanism at the trigger point.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of the closed eye process is to help yourself develop a <br/>\nwitness - an internal voice that pops up to say &quot;warning - you are <br/>\nabout to be angry.&quot; That&#39;s the time to breathe or schedule a mommy time <br/>\nout (just change rooms for fifteen seconds instead of blowing up). <br/>\nUsually one change in the pattern is enough to buy you time so that you <br/>\nwon&#39;t blow up and can stop yourself. But self-awareness is key and that <br/>\ntakes a little practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94854,"nextTopicId":94881}}
