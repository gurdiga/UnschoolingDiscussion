As long as they have information *and* freedom *and*<br/>\nthe support/help as they need it, they will.  The choices they made<br/>\nlast week may be completely different from the ones they make next<br/>\nyear.  It&#39;s a learning process -- it doesn&#39;t happen all at once, or<br/>\neven in neat little graduated steps.  It happens over time, at their<br/>\nown pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n== My own food habits follow a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; similar pattern and I don&#39;t get the signal that I&#39;m hungry so I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; eat until it&#39;s too late and I have a headache and am cranky.   <br/>\n&gt; Thinking about food in advance is trying to say the least...heavy <br/>\n&gt; sigh. I guess there is no help there.  If only I were rich, I would <br/>\n&gt; have a personal chef to set food in front of my family and I. :)==<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So no wonder they&#39;re having the same issue, right?  You and your kids<br/>\nare learning together, as in so much of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me, and I started to realize that I had some behaviors<br/>\n(about waiting to eat) that I was doing habitually, I would probably<br/>\nstart exploring that and journaling about it, bringing up memories and<br/>\nimages I associate with the issue -- getting a good look at the<br/>\nchoices my unconscious is making while I&#39;m not looking, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also start noting when I do feel enthusiastic about food and<br/>\nwhen I don&#39;t.  When I do, I would use that energy to make some good, <br/>\nnurturing food and snacks ahead of time.  Banana nut bread, apple<br/>\ncheddar nut bread, whole wheat pancakes, frozen smoothie popsicles, a<br/>\nbatch of trail mix, a whole-wheat pasta dish that will keep or freeze,<br/>\na big salad ... even just cutting up cheese and lunchmeat and veggies<br/>\nfor finger snacks over the next few days.  Stuff that you like and<br/>\nstuff that your kids like.  Focus on finger foods, since it sounds<br/>\nlike your kids (and maybe you) need to be able to eat while you&#39;re<br/>\ndoing the things that interest you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, as you head into the times that you don&#39;t feel so energetic<br/>\nabout food, you have stuff made ahead that you can feel good about and<br/>\ncan easily pull out.  To bring to your children while they&#39;re watching<br/>\nTV.  To bring with you on outings.  And so on. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n== are my expectations too high to expect that they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; should gravitate to a variaty of food that supplies an adequate amount <br/>\n&gt; of nutrition? ==<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t get in your head and see what exactly your expectations are<br/>\nwhen it comes to words like gravitate and variety and adequate and<br/>\nnutrition.  My kids gravitate to a variety of adequately nutrional<br/>\nfoods, by my definition, but they still have ice cream or otter pops<br/>\nfor breakfast sometimes. &lt;G&gt;  And they still will go through phases<br/>\nwhere they eat mostly one food or one type of food for days at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you will answer your own question as you take a breath and<br/>\nhonestly explore your own expectations.  Remember that &quot;nutrition&quot;<br/>\nbalances out over a few days.  Remember that they need information<br/>\n(not nagging) given in a helpful, supportive, &quot;let&#39;s try it and see&quot;<br/>\nenvironment.  Remember that your expectations may be (are probably)<br/>\ncolored by your own issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nA pretty good book that might help you explore these issues is<br/>\n_Preventing Childhood Eating Problems_ by Jane R. Hirschmann.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nlittle mainstream on things like weaning (or at one point she mentions<br/>\nthe difficulty of living with teenagers -- definitely not<br/>\nunschooling), but it contains references to the scientific data that<br/>\nsupports &quot;self-demand feeding,&quot; as she calls it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: A Food Scenerio","postDate":"1118941325","msgId":106642,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4Ljc1M2Q0MThjLjJmZTMwYThkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":106641,"nextInTopic":106643,"prevInTime":106641,"nextInTime":106643,"topicId":106606,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/16/2005 10:26:21 AM Central Standard Time, DanaBurdick@comcast.net writes: In the event he didn t want to come, I would say to him that he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1707956748\">In a message dated 6/16/2005 10:26:21 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DanaBurdick@...\">DanaBurdick@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the event he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to come, I would say to him that he could just  get <br/>\nsomething later when he takes a break. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nIf the goal is to keep him on an even keel, why wouldn&#39;t one of the options  <br/>\nbe to bring the food to the computer?  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: A Food Scenerio","postDate":"1118941110","msgId":106641,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ4c2IzbStxa2NzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjE2MTUzODEyLjk1Njk0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDI2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106640,"nextInTopic":106642,"prevInTime":106640,"nextInTime":106642,"topicId":106606,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Is this similiar to what people mistakenly think about  <br/>\nunschooling? -=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWell...<br/>\nThat makes it sound like you&#39;ve already decided it&#39;s a mistaken idea, and  <br/>\nfalse.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids do have good awareness of what they need to eat.   That  doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nthey love salad or eat &quot;enough fruit&quot; (by the charts), but it  absolutely <br/>\nDOES mean they don&#39;t live on sweets or starches.  (Kirby eats  more breakfast <br/>\ncereal than I think is good, but if I start to rag on him I&#39;m  sure that will <br/>\nonly be worse than leaving him alone.)  They&#39;re all good  about eating protein <br/>\nand drinking water and juice and milk, though they&#39;ll drink  soda too.  They <br/>\ndon&#39;t crave soda.  They eat it with pizza and things  that &quot;need soda.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd it&#39;s not just &quot;how the foods make them feel after,&quot; it&#39;s almost a  <br/>\nknowledge of needing more roughage or something soothing to the stomach.   Sometimes <br/>\none of them will just want rice or ramen with nothing else.   Filling but <br/>\nbland.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMarty and Holly have braces.  I forget they&#39;re not supposed to eat  popcorn <br/>\nor nuts.  They never, ever forget.  Kids whose parents try to  control what <br/>\nthey can and can&#39;t eat because they have braces will have kids who  sneak the <br/>\nfoods thinking they&#39;re &quot;winning&quot; or getting away with something.   I&#39;ve known <br/>\nseveral other (controlled schooled) kids with braces who seemed to  think that as <br/>\nlong as their parents or the orthodontist didn&#39;t know, it was  okay.  Holly <br/>\nand Marty are fully aware of the reasons not to chew sticky  gum or have hard <br/>\nfood or corn on the cob.  One of  Holly&#39;s favorite  foods is apple, and she <br/>\nused to eat them a lot.  She chose to have braces,  though, and now she&#39;ll only <br/>\neat cut-up apple.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=- Is this similiar to what people mistakenly think about  <br/>\nunschooling?  All children will read Shakespear and love Calculus to  <br/>\nboot left to learn on their own?  Obviously, not every person is going  <br/>\nto like Shakespear and not every person is going to like salad.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThe idea that Shakespeare is like salad, though, is (I&#39;m thinking maybe) a  <br/>\nschoolish idea.  Shakespeare is part of a balanced curriculum.  Salad  is part <br/>\nof a balanced modern diet.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSome people live and breathe Shakespeare.  That&#39;s not unhealthy.   <br/>\nShakespeare involves history, poetry, costume,  philosophy, theology,  politics, <br/>\nlanguage, interpersonal relations, prejudices, slapstick humor,  culture... and <br/>\nthat&#39;s before even getting to the actual staging, sets, costume,  lighting, music, <br/>\nmake-up...    <br/>\n <br/>\nSalad is just salad.  It doesn&#39;t need to be in the form of a  salad.  There <br/>\nare other and better ways to eat green  vegetables than chopped in a bowl with <br/>\ntoo much vinegar, oil and sugar on  top.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-I don&#39;t have any expectation that my kids will love salad at any time in  <br/>\ntheir lives,-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nLots of people go through a season in their lives (or in the year) when  they <br/>\nlove salad.

The beauty of food courts is that <br/>\n*everyone* should be able to find something to enjoy. A sit down <br/>\nrestaurant is slightly different, and if I&#39;d known about the cookie in <br/>\nadvance, then the cookie would&#39;ve been the first on our agenda. If I <br/>\nwere sitting down with my three young kids and we were already in the <br/>\nmiddle of eating when the cookie came up, I would tell my son that we&#39;d <br/>\nstop first thing after I&#39;d paid the check here. I wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>\nrun get it while I left them at the table, and none of them is old <br/>\nenough to head over on their own, so I would feel kinda stuck. I&#39;d also <br/>\ntry to see if there were any cookies or something available where we <br/>\nwere that he might like to have instead or at least in the mean time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But the story is not finished.  Later, my son has a major blood <br/>\n&gt;sugar dip and was very emotional and combative because he had only <br/>\n&gt;eaten a slice of bread and a cookie the entire day.  Similar <br/>\n&gt;scenarios of this sort have happened many times.  I allow the <br/>\n&gt;children to eat anything anytime, but they tend to break down later <br/>\n&gt;when they have not had sufficient calories and/or protein to carry <br/>\n&gt;them through.  Food is available to them, but they choose not to eat <br/>\n&gt;until it is too late and they are crying and yelling.  So, I am <br/>\n&gt;interested in knowing what suggestions people might have for <br/>\n&gt;handling this pattern and helping my children through this bit of a <br/>\n&gt;stickler.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a son who is *very* much like this, but he also knows he&#39;s like <br/>\nthis because we&#39;ve had lots of conversations about it. *I&#39;m* also very <br/>\nmuch like this, so he gets it from me, and I&#39;m able to model good <br/>\nchoices for him, so it&#39;s not always about *him.*  Because of this, he&#39;s <br/>\nvery used to the, &quot;Sure! What can I get you with the cookie that will <br/>\nhelp your body feel full and keep your blood sugar even?&quot; He gets this <br/>\nrather often because he&#39;ll ask for a cookie or ice cream first thing in <br/>\nthe morning when he wakes up, an especially important time of the day <br/>\nfor him to have protein of some sort. He&#39;s fine with the response <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s always gotten the cookie in addition to the food and <br/>\nusually first while I&#39;m preparing whatever else he&#39;s going to eat.

Similar <br/>\nscenarios of this sort have happened many  times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nProvide food without making him choose it first.  My son has a  terrible time <br/>\ndeciding what to eat and when he was 4 or 5 it was horrible, with  some of <br/>\nthe same consequences.  I offered him bites of what I had at odd  times (ham <br/>\nsandwich or whatever) and he would usually take one.  As he got  older and could <br/>\nsee the pattern I could have a conversation about it with  him.  We called the <br/>\nreaction the &quot;hungry uglies&quot;.  So, on the mornings  he asked me to run out <br/>\nand get donuts (a major cause of the hungry uglies for  him), I&#39;d ask, &quot;how are <br/>\nwe going to prevent the hungry uglies?&quot; and he&#39;d have an  idea...maybe a piece <br/>\nof cheese first or he could eat again at 10:00 or get a  piece of sausage <br/>\nwith his donut.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing I absolutely counted on to prevent that behavior was me fixing  <br/>\nsomething to eat and nibbling on it myself.  I wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;I&#39;m slicing  up an <br/>\napple, want some?&quot;  I&#39;d just go in and slice up the apple and go plop  down <br/>\nbeside him and eat it.  For Will, it&#39;s the change from doing what he&#39;s  doing to <br/>\ndeciding what to eat that seems to be the problem.  He doesn&#39;t  want to have <br/>\nto think about food--he just wants it in front of him.  At  restaurants, he <br/>\nneeds lots of time to look at the menu, even if he&#39;s just  getting the same <br/>\nthing he always gets.  When I cook, instead of putting  salad on his plate, I save <br/>\nout half the cucumber and slice it up and put on his  plate.  I cut up a <br/>\nlittle steak for his plate.  I only put things on  his plate that I know he has <br/>\neaten and liked in the past.  At 11, I can ask  him if he&#39;s hungry and he&#39;ll say <br/>\n&quot;I had a bowl of cereal&quot; or &quot;YEAH!&quot;  He no  longer says, &quot;what are you <br/>\nmaking?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a progression.  He knows he has to eat.  When he was younger  he didn&#39;t <br/>\nrecognize those symptoms of hunger in time.  We didn&#39;t put  pressure on him to <br/>\ntry new things (he learned about trying new things from Blues  Clues when he <br/>\nwas 3--his palate is way more adventurous than mine).  We  don&#39;t make him eat <br/>\nanything he doesn&#39;t want, even if he asked for it.  It  was hard at first, <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m a waste not/want not type of person.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNow he wakes up and asks me to take him to the local diner for their  <br/>\nfarmer&#39;s breakfast, pancakes, eggs, sausage gravy and biscuits, bacon,  etc.  He eats <br/>\nmuch more than he used to, and he can fix himself something  if I&#39;m not <br/>\nthinking about it.  If I ask him if he wants a grilled cheese,  he usually says <br/>\nyes.  I still surprise him with food in his room and he  sometimes doesn&#39;t know <br/>\nhe&#39;s hungry until he sees it.  But the hungry uglies  are a thing of the past.  <br/>\nHe thinks about how much sugar he&#39;s had himself,  and makes adjustments.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe learning curve wasn&#39;t all that steep.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: A Food Scenerio","postDate":"1118917510","msgId":106622,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwMjdhZTBkMjVmMmY2OTE4NThlMzg3NGI4OWRiZTdmQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ4cXRvbCt1a3QyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQ4cXRvbCt1a3QyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106620,"nextInTopic":106623,"prevInTime":106621,"nextInTime":106623,"topicId":106606,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I allow the <br/>\nchildren to eat anything anytime, but they tend to break down later <br/>\nwhen they have not had sufficient calories and/or protein to carry <br/>\nthem through.  Food is available to them, but they choose not to eat <br/>\nuntil it is too late and they are crying and yelling.  So, I am <br/>\ninterested in knowing what suggestions people might have for <br/>\nhandling this pattern and helping my children through this bit of a <br/>\nstickler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143938653,"authorName":"K Krejci","from":"K Krejci &lt;kraekrej@...&gt;","profile":"kraekrej","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] A Food Scenerio","postDate":"1118889466","msgId":106613,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjE2MDIzNzQ2LjIwNzY5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0MzA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ4cTZwMCt2YjRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106612,"nextInTopic":106614,"prevInTime":106612,"nextInTime":106614,"topicId":106606,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Life is uncertain - eat dessert first. ...
