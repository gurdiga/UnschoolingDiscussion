Anyone who <br/>\nknows me knows that this is my one THING on TV!  But I have to tell <br/>\nyou how funny I find the commercials.  The first commercial I <br/>\nencounter is very big busted women showing off their Victoria&#39;s <br/>\nSecret bras (lots of cleavage and things like feathers on their big, <br/>\nseductive lips!) then I&#39;m treated to dancing tampons after that (I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever actually seen tampons make water-ballet formations, but it is <br/>\namuzing), then I&#39;m shown how I can be a better mom by getting my <br/>\nclothes whiter & brighter or how wonderful I&#39;d be if I only chose the <br/>\nright peanut butter!  Bloussant commercials do show me how to <br/>\nincrease my bustline but I&#39;ve already taken care of that through <br/>\npregnancy and nursing!!  And, based on these commercials, you&#39;d never <br/>\nthink that someone like me could attract a man wearing cotton Wal-<br/>\nMart underwear, using maxi-pads, or washing white underwear and blue <br/>\njeans in the same load!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, Hooked on Phonics, gotta love that!!  Not only do your children <br/>\nget treated to hours and years of learning to read in school, but you <br/>\ncan spend hundreds of dollars on that product to make them even <br/>\nbetter readers!!  Being of the John Holt unschooling mind, some of us <br/>\nhave children that have actually learned to read, spell, and <br/>\ncomprehend it all within minimal instruction and no fees!
