We&#39;d been living separately for over 4 years; <br/>\n&gt;my son<br/>\n&gt;was 5. The two had seen each other for a total of about  - oh, I&#39;d say 8 to <br/>\n&gt;12<br/>\n&gt;hours in those four years. Ted wanted joint custody because he &quot;wasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;sure&quot;<br/>\n&gt;about &quot;this homeschooling thing&quot;. He lived 300 miles away, and didn&#39;t want <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;take over the parenting or anything, he just wanted to be able to make <br/>\n&gt;decisions<br/>\n&gt;about how &quot;his son&quot; should live! He&#39;d pay for the divorce and everything, I<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t have to worry about that. He&#39;d take care of it all as soon as he got <br/>\n&gt;back<br/>\n&gt;from his trip to Hawaii. (Nice of him!) Well, as you can imagine, the next <br/>\n&gt;day I<br/>\n&gt;went out and got myself a lawyer and filed for divorce on my terms. His <br/>\n&gt;case was<br/>\n&gt;a lost cause from the start, and though the lawyers tried to screw us <br/>\n&gt;around and<br/>\n&gt;make it take a lot longer than it should have, and I ended up with a lot <br/>\n&gt;less in<br/>\n&gt;child support than I think I should have, I have sole custody of my son, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;we&#39;ve been homeschooling ever since.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ted never was able to handle the responsiblilty of fatherhood, and the 6 or <br/>\n&gt;7<br/>\n&gt;years of his life before my son finally divorced his dad were filled with <br/>\n&gt;lies<br/>\n&gt;and broken promises on Ted&#39;s part, and heartbreak, anger, hatred, guilt, <br/>\n&gt;fear and<br/>\n&gt;nightmares for my son. Finally, I don&#39;t remember if JL was 6 or 7, at <br/>\n&gt;midnight on<br/>\n&gt;New Years Eve, we had a healing circle that included a &quot;funeral&quot; ceremony <br/>\n&gt;for the<br/>\n&gt;father that JL never had, and a snuffing of his father&#39;s candle. This part <br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;JL&#39;s inclusion, and it turned out to be crucial to the ceremony. In fact it <br/>\n&gt;had<br/>\n&gt;to be (rather gleefully) snuffed three times before it was really &quot;done&quot;. <br/>\n&gt;After<br/>\n&gt;that the intensity went out of his feelings about his father, and they <br/>\n&gt;gradually<br/>\n&gt;just faded away. Now, at 14, he has no particular feelings toward his <br/>\n&gt;father (not<br/>\n&gt;conscious ones anyway), and there has been almost no contact for years (a <br/>\n&gt;30<br/>\n&gt;second birthday phone call 2 or 3 years ago).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;A legally simple situation; his demand for joint custody was laughable. I <br/>\n&gt;hope<br/>\n&gt;all goes well in the situation you are thinking of.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;djedi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Sat, 29 Jul 2000 23:46:01 EDT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AmyKCA@...\">AmyKCA@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: New to the list<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi!  I am new to the list, my name is Amy, and I am the proud mom of one <br/>\n&gt;son.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  My ds is 7 1/2 yo, and we are unschoolers.  I also run an award winning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In-Home Daycare for children, lead a 4-H group, and have started a local<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschooling support group.  Of course, I could not do all of this <br/>\n&gt;without<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the support of my wonderful hubby, he is the best.  My son is an <br/>\n&gt;Active/Alert<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child, which is sort of a combination of traits from ADD, ADHD, and ODD.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; These children are very bright, but will defy you to the ends of the <br/>\n&gt;earth.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Essentially their main problem is that they have hyper-sensitive sensory<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perceptions, and therefore feel overwhelmed most of the time.  This in <br/>\n&gt;turn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; creates a fearful child, who tries to control this fear by controlling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his/her environment (clear as mud?)  Anyway, I really look forward to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exchanging ideas and stories with all of you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I do have one request:  If any of you have been involved in a custody <br/>\n&gt;issue<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with an ex-spouse (that involved homeschooling), and if you don&#39;t mind<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sharing your story with other homeschoolers, would you please email me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; privately?
