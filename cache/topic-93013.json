At that age what I loved most was that he&#39;d let me <br/>\nplan the agenda, so I looked at a good tourist&#39;s map of Boston and <br/>\npicked the agenda, and we&#39;d ride the T from place to place (I think <br/>\nyou can still get a day pass for like $5).  My favorites were <br/>\nbrowsing Faneuil (sp?) Hall, which is a big marketplace with <br/>\nvendors, restaurants, etc. and lunch at Chinatown.  The map also <br/>\nshows &quot;music district,&quot; etc., as far as shops.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nwhat &quot;inexpensive&quot; is for you, as I consider the aquarium to be very <br/>\nexpensive for a family outing (it&#39;s our &quot;big&quot; summer outing we&#39;ve <br/>\nplanned), but of course there&#39;s also the Boston Children&#39;s museum, <br/>\nthe Museum of Science (where Morgaine and I had a blast on our <br/>\nspecial day out a few months ago -- another big expedition for us <br/>\nsince she&#39;d been asking to see so many things from it), there&#39;s the <br/>\nart museum, and lots of other things.  The aquarium is easily a half-<br/>\nday&#39;s trip at least for most kids taking their time.  Really a good <br/>\ntourist&#39;s map is your best bet though.

An interactive scaling <br/>\nactivity reveals how filmmakers can make the actors appear to be tiny Hobbit-sized <br/>\nor large wizard-sized, using an ingenious mix of trick photography, forced <br/>\nperspectives, and props made at different scales. Visitors can also see themselves <br/>\ntransformed as Hobbit or wizard-sized in their own photo.<br/>\n The exhibit was developed by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in <br/>\npartnership with New Line Cinema, the producers of the film trilogy.
