I&#39;d be happy working one day<br/>\n&gt; a week and living in something smaller than a trailer, as long as I had a<br/>\n&gt; community and wildlife around me.  That&#39;s how empty I feel everything is.<br/>\n&gt;  I can&#39;t think of a more horrible, soul-stabbing, miserable feeling than<br/>\n&gt; walking into a building every morning that restricts me of my freedom to<br/>\n&gt; fully interact with others and be at one with nature, whether it&#39;s school<br/>\n&gt; or a job.  I&#39;ve had times where I almost cry at the beginning of the day,<br/>\n&gt; just like a kindergartner would on the first day.  I guess I never<br/>\n&gt; learned to fully cope with being in institutions.  I was never fully<br/>\n&gt; sucked into &quot;the system&quot;, so I am still part human.  I think that is why<br/>\n&gt; I have such a hard time getting jobs and going to school.  For example, I<br/>\n&gt; can apply for a job but I cannot go to an interview, because if I get<br/>\n&gt; hired that means my freedom is gone.  I can go to a certain extent.  It&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; a good thing and a bad thing, I guess.
