In my <br/>\nexperience, sadly, church and at family gatherings of extended spanking families.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was really little, in Texas, in the 50&#39;s, Rastus and Liza jokes were <br/>\ncommon.  They were along the lines of two-character moron jokes.  The effect, <br/>\nthough, was to create prejudice and an image of African Americans as, well, <br/>\nmorons.   I moved to Northern New Mexico, a WHOLE different culture, and never <br/>\nheard another one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, anti-female jokes were common.  Nasty jokes <br/>\nabout rape and about stupidity.  Not like blonde jokes, but worse.   The <br/>\nwomen&#39;s movement made people less likely to tell or laugh at those jokes.  It empo<br/>\nwered women to say &quot;That&#39;s not funny,&quot; and &quot;That attitude is sexist and <br/>\nignorant.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next wave to which people rarely object is anti-child humor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that none of those jokes are funny.  One can&#39;t help laughing <br/>\nsometimes at a surprising ending or a ridiculous situation, and the laughing <br/>\nitself can be forgiven, but I do think if there is to be cultural change, it&#39;s <br/>\nworth pointing out to our friends, our parents, our children, that humor that <br/>\nundermines a class of people, and humor to which others are afraid to object <br/>\n(or to which they never considered objecting) perpetuates problems we could <br/>\nbenefit from dumping.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was on someone&#39;s humor list, and once received a set of anti-child jokes <br/>\nthat really offended me.  I responded to the list and said something along the <br/>\nlines of what&#39;s above (but very short version), and got three hateful e-mails <br/>\nand lost my friendship.   I don&#39;t care.  The people on that list were almost <br/>\nall teachers in the public schools, in Salt Lake City.   Some of them I know to <br/>\nbe childless.  My friend adopted three Russian sisters who were already <br/>\nschoolage (and they&#39;re BIGTIME in school, in which she is fully invested).  I liked <br/>\nthat friendship a great deal at one time, but I like my children&#39;s future much <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a New Mexico list for homeschoolers I created and maintained for years, <br/>\nsomeone put up a quote from e-Bay (? great source of quotes?) that said raising <br/>\na teenager was like nailing jello to a tree.   I objected to it, lightly, said <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t having problems with my unschooled teens, and was hooted down by <br/>\nsome people insulting me and unschooling.   The upshot was I gave the list to <br/>\nsomeone with thicker skin and newer energy, and I quit the whole list.  If on a <br/>\nhomeschooling list it&#39;s to be fine to insult those whole people to whom we have <br/>\nsupposedly dedicated our lives, there are problems with homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe it&#39;s just a problem with the image of children in this culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s like hazing.  Whatever psychology make fraternities, military <br/>\ntraining facilities, high school football teams, etc., WANT to torment the new <br/>\nrecruits is what makes adults torment children.  They were tormented and their <br/>\nsolace was that someday they would be the tormentors.   How does it stop?  <br/>\nPeople die.  Football players and fraternity members and recruits die.
