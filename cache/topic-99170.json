It was the last (most recent, maybe not always last) <br/>\ninstallment of the Black Adder series, involves time travel, and Colin Firth plays <br/>\nShakespeare.  See how Black Adder deals with him on behalf of all school <br/>\nchildren thereafter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Black Adder, and Colin Firth, and Shakespeare.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf my kids, none fear Shakespeare.   When Marty stayed with Anne Ohman&#39;s <br/>\nfamily, they saw a production of The Tempest, with an actor who&#39;s a friend of <br/>\nAnne&#39;s and Marty had met him beforehand.  As soon as Marty got into the hotel room <br/>\nat the conference, he told me lots about it, and showed me the program.   <br/>\nWhen we were packing to leave, he couldn&#39;t find that program, and was as close to <br/>\ngrouchy as he had been all weekend when I didn&#39;t know where it was either.  <br/>\nWe searched, it was located (in my pile of papers) and he was happy again.     <br/>\nHe&#39;s talked to me a couple of times since then.  I have a Classic Comics or <br/>\nsome other kind of illustrated version of it, and I intend to locate that and <br/>\nleave it on Marty&#39;s bed at some point soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut &quot;studying&quot; Shakespeare is quite different from enjoying and appreciating <br/>\nShakespeare if my kids are any indication.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother wonderful thing to get if you yourself are afraid of Shakespeare or <br/>\nmarred by previous &quot;exposure&quot; or you didn&#39;t have much exposure and would like <br/>\nmore is &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare,&quot; also on DVD, by The <br/>\nReduced Shakespeare Company.  There are only two plays they do at length, but <br/>\nthey...  well, you&#39;ll see.  And you won&#39;t be sorry if you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily for us all, we can see Shakespeare in our own homes, done by <br/>\nprofessionals, and we can pause or rewind or fast forward, we can eat chocolate chip <br/>\nice cream or hamburgers (neither of which were known to anyone at The Globe <br/>\nTheatre), sit on soft couches with kids in our laps, have subtitles playing...  I <br/>\nlove DVDs.  And I&#39;m grateful to anyone who has ever made a film of <br/>\nShakespeare.   Netflix has a DVD for rent (which means it&#39;s for sale too, but it might <br/>\nnot be so cheap) of some of the earliest silent movies of Shakespeare plays.  <br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s only one scene of a  play, and some were very experimental <br/>\nthings with interesting special effects.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wrote before any of the three recommendations above were <br/>\navailable, called &quot;Bringing Shakespeare Home&quot; (and I should probably add what I <br/>\nwrote above to it, now that I think of it; I love the internet almost as much <br/>\nas I love DVDs--does that make me &quot;media drenched&quot;? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/essay05.shtml\">http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/essay05.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAh...
