Our 11 year old was diagnosed <br/>\nwith mild ADD last year during her horrible 4th grade year in our highly <br/>\nrated public school system.  We went the Ritalin route for 6 months.  My very <br/>\nbright, creative child had every bit of self-confidence knocked out of her <br/>\nlast year and we were desperate to help her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are now &quot;handling&quot; these issues through home schooling with a liberal dose <br/>\nof unschooling!  Emily is an immensely happier child now than she was last <br/>\nyear.  Yes, she has her moments when her behavior is a little out of control, <br/>\nand yes, she sometimes has difficulty concentrating on paperwork for more <br/>\nthan 20 minutes.  But the beauty of all this, as you know, is that she no <br/>\nlonger has to conform to the standards imposed on kids in government schools. <br/>\n She went from being very angry at us for taking her out of school to <br/>\nbecoming the leading fan of home schooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou do what works for your child within your own framework of values and <br/>\nphilosphy.  When we were going through this last year we heard every opinion <br/>\nin the book about Ritalin and tried to keep an open mind while tryng to help <br/>\nour child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Brown","from":"Brown &lt;mjcmbrwn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"tEVnXucnihTsbjsYOVzrhO3i_FoIY6TDB7rixQnTLDu8PaVZC3VQK1FDpCndeT_8qzvGw8itidoLNz8kiQcMfdsB","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Ritalin","postDate":"945300022","msgId":5293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNDEuNTI5My45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5291,"nextInTopic":5300,"prevInTime":5292,"nextInTime":5294,"topicId":5291,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On the news here just a few days ago I heard about a study done at Auckland University that came out with proof *against* Ritalin for ADHD.
