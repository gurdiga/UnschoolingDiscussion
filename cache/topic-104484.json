What made it different for me than some kids whose interests were  horses <br/>\nor cars or bottle cap collection was that my interests were history and  <br/>\ngeography and the history of words, and of clothes and music.  So in  school, I <br/>\nknew more and could do better in class because of what I learned for  fun <br/>\noutside.  And the teachers just BEAMED and patted themselves on the  head about how <br/>\nmuch work they had done to make me so &quot;smart.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut as I also had wanted to be a teacher since I was six and had Miss  <br/>\nTomlinson who was so much nicer to me than my mom was, it didn&#39;t bother me to  see <br/>\nteacher-foibles. It was something I learned from.  And other teachers  KNEW <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t &quot;my teacher&quot; in one way or another, and gave me space and  resources <br/>\nto learn more on my own, because they DID see it and were helpful to  me <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSchool gave me an identity outside my family which was great for me.   They <br/>\ngave me chances for success in a grades-and-test-scores way, and that was  <br/>\nhelpful for me.  Not until years later did I reflect deeply on the effect  of my <br/>\n&quot;winning&quot; on so many other kids who might&#39;ve liked to have been first or  best <br/>\nmore often, but school created that competitive field, I didn&#39;t.  And  when I <br/>\ndid try to throw the curve (as a community service, at the request of  others <br/>\nin my 9th grade science class) I got in trouble.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo when I was in the midst of much &quot;teaching&quot; I was clinically observing to  <br/>\nsee what kind of teacher I did and didn&#39;t want to be, and that goal of &quot;finish <br/>\n this and come back and teach&quot; lasted through college and some years more.   <br/>\nI&#39;m glad some college education professor told me that there&#39;s no such action <br/>\nas  &#39;teaching,&#39; the most you can do is facilitate learning.

I know for  myself, I <br/>\nwas schooled, never even homeschooled, and I did have interests  outside of <br/>\nschool and do think that I did learn outside of school.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor me the difference is that I didn&#39;t place any value on the things I  <br/>\nlearned outside of school.  I thought the only place to learn anything  valuable <br/>\nwas in school, so that was the important stuff.  Anything else was  unimportant <br/>\nand I was not encouraged to pursue those outside interests.  I  was encouraged <br/>\nand rewarded for good grades and school work.  And that is  how my life went. <br/>\n I chose a profession, nursing, because that was  valued.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI remember having passing interests in gardening, sewing, and  cooking.  But <br/>\nwas not encouraged to pursue these interests.   Horticulture class and Home EC <br/>\nwere not on my list of classes even, as I was on  the college bound track, no <br/>\ntime for those trivial classes.  Those were not  the classes that someone <br/>\nheaded for college took.  And college was the  place to be. So I lost interest in <br/>\nthose things for a while, and am only  now getting back to what really <br/>\ninterests me.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor my boys, they will never feel that.  They are able to explore  whatever <br/>\nthey want.  They so not see anything in terms of college bound or  not.  It is <br/>\nan interest that may lead to more or maybe not.  They  decide what is <br/>\nimportant or not.  Their life will be different.  It  won&#39;t take them almost 40 years <br/>\nto find their interests and be able to &quot;go for  it&quot;.  They will not see school <br/>\nas where the &quot;important information  is&quot;.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor me it is what school does to your spirit.  Not if you learned  anything <br/>\noutside of school.  It is the importance you place on it.
