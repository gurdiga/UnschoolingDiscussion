I definitely understand what you are saying. I don&#39;t see it as, and I suspect they won&#39;t see it as &quot;not trusting&quot; them either. They (the children) trust us as parents to guide and teach them as much as we can. Sure I will make, well, I have made mistakes along the way -- and will probably make many more.<br/>\nI see what you are saying regarding using textbooks to teach English/Math -- using the Bible with software and books are definitely a must. I need to see that reading as much as our son does equips him to write and speak English without any difficulties. As far as Math, he loves math, but not the textbooks -- I shall reconsider math another way (thank you). Actually, almost everything we do involves math.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Monica<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.

There is no point in interrupting her as she does these things, as<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t hesitate to show you, by answering in monosyllables (if at all)<br/>\nthat it IS an interruption.<br/>\n<br/>\nWally (47) was up next and on the computer. Mikey eventually finished<br/>\nwhatever it is she was doing (to the outside eye, what she was doing looked<br/>\nlike staring fixedly at a dollhouse we have downstairs. To those of us who<br/>\nare keen Mikey observers, we&#39;re pretty sure she was plotting the fates of<br/>\nworlds.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had finished playing with rabbits and guinea pigs and fixed Mikey some<br/>\nbreakfast. Brit (8) was up by now and playing Spyro on the Playstation.<br/>\nMikey asked for breakfast, Brit did not (Brit, like me, eschews food until<br/>\nshe&#39;s been up for an hour or three). I asked Mikey what she wanted and she<br/>\nsaid, &quot;What do we have?&quot; and I recited everything I could think of and then,<br/>\nas I felt she was not impressed, added, &quot;Would you like me to fix you some<br/>\nnice hippopotamus?&quot; which made her laugh and say, &quot;No!&quot; and then,<br/>\nthoughtfully, &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think we *have* any hippopotamus,&quot; in a tone<br/>\nof voice that tells me we may be making a trip to the Weird Meats store a<br/>\nfew towns away sometime. &lt;g&gt; She settled for frozen waffles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Brit and Wally and Mikey sat down at his computer to look over the<br/>\ndigital camera photos the girls had taken with their camera the night before<br/>\n(a camera bought two Christmases ago that we all had forgotten existed and<br/>\nwas somehow unearthed somewhere yesterday). The photos were blurry and so<br/>\nWally and the girls all went out in the yard and practiced taking more<br/>\nphotos. While this was going on I was doing book orders, and left for our<br/>\nstorage space while they were still outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got back, they were reviewing the new set on the computer and noting<br/>\nwhere they&#39;d got them right and where some were still bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I&#39;m reading email and maybe doing more work and Wally is researching<br/>\nbulk upload systems and the girls are downstairs doing I-don&#39;t-know-what but<br/>\nin awhile they&#39;ll come to check on us or we&#39;ll go to check on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next organized thing I can think of that we&#39;re doing is park day next<br/>\nTuesday, but we&#39;ll be doing a whole lot of things between now and then that<br/>\njust come up or that we think of as we go through our days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s aiding and abetting your children in living their lives and doing the<br/>\nthings they want to do, they find important, or they are curious about.
