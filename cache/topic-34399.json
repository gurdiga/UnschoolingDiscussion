I know a <br/>\nyoung man who recently graduated from university in math and computer <br/>\nscience.  He was unschooled through high school.  I asked him a couple of <br/>\nyears ago whether he had memorized the multiplication tables.  He said he <br/>\nhadn&#39;t, but he could figure them out faster than most people are able to <br/>\nrecall them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if trying to get her to master the tables has held up her actual <br/>\n*understanding* of them.  In other words, if you don&#39;t understand what <br/>\nmultiplication actually is, adding the same number x number of times, then <br/>\nit&#39;s going to be awfully hard to remember them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Here in AZ they do this third grade AIMS standardized testing.

But if I had been able to get it at my own <br/>\nspeed?  Who knows what I might have done.  I&#39;ve always been good with logic <br/>\nstuff.  It was the numbers that got to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout testing at different grade levels . . . I went through the BC <br/>\nlearning outcomes one year for the report I had to send for my son.  I had <br/>\nstuff marked off in various subjects from kindergarten to grade 8 <br/>\nlevel.  He was all over the map.  Still is.  &lt;g&gt;  I asked the online <br/>\nteacher how many kids in the average grade 4 classroom would be at the <br/>\n&quot;correct&quot; grade level in every subject.  His answer was none.

I <br/>\ncan multiply anything (within about 3 digits I think =)  Fractions, however, <br/>\nwere understood in days by my girl.  Each child being so different means that <br/>\nthere has to be the freedom of time, different approaches to &quot;getting it&quot; and <br/>\nopportunities to see it in many ways (i.e. pie pieces, money, etc. for <br/>\nfractions.) Multiplication is harder thought. <br/>\nI think that&#39;s where I most definitely am outside the unschool method as I <br/>\nunderstand it. I want her to learn multiplication facts, the table of <br/>\nfactors. She&#39;s finally got it, but its not her personal strength.  That&#39;s <br/>\nokay...we aren&#39;t drill sergeants here making sure she can recite them on cue <br/>\n=p<br/>\nI must say this though: it was public schools (last year) that really screwed <br/>\nher up in this area! They spent four or five sessions on multiplication <br/>\nduring the year and if you didn&#39;t get it then that&#39;s just too bad. Why the <br/>\nheck they kept jumping around back and forth I will never understand. They <br/>\ndid it just in time so that whatever she may have learned/remembered was gone <br/>\nby the time they went back to it.
