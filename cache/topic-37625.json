There is a taboo and limit to how<br/>\nmuch sex is appropriate and so influences our culture and society in how we<br/>\nthink about each.  I&#39;m not condoning either one but it does seem unbalanced<br/>\nand I think this unbalance might be one reason why ppl have a problem with<br/>\nsex in movies and not violence.  I wonder if I tell my kids they can watch<br/>\nviolent movies but not graphic sex just what am I telling them?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one thinks that graphic sex in movies is bad and will influence<br/>\nnegatively than the same holds true for violence in movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, pornography is the extreme but why is that not ok when all violence and<br/>\nblood and gore is?  If it wasn&#39;t such a big deal the industry probably<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t make more money than Hollywood.  One of the reasons IMO that<br/>\nHollywood doesn&#39;t have graphic sex is only because society isn&#39;t ready to<br/>\nexcept it like they are violence.

The sex industry <br/>\nbrings in more money each year than Hollywood. Americans are into sex. The <br/>\nproblem is why they are into it that way?<br/>\n<br/>\nViolence is a fairly simple matter: It doesn&#39;t take much to destroy a Van <br/>\nGogh (if you can get in the vicinity of one), but it takes a hell of a lot to <br/>\ncreate something of that level. Violence is easy, if you will. Many of us <br/>\nidentify with it for that reason -- we&#39;d love to bust up a restaurant, drive <br/>\na car off a bridge, knock some heads together (if only life were like a Daffy <br/>\nDuck cartoon!). Indeed, simple violence has the appearance of power, <br/>\neffectiveness, accomplishment, and we like -- and identify with -- those <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSex, on the other hand, is a purely creative act. The trouble is, being <br/>\ncreative is difficult work. Moreover, sex inherently exposes almost every <br/>\nweakness we have. We are at our most vulnerable during sex, and we hate that! <br/>\nWe crave power, not weakness. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has something to do with our being uncomfortable with it on the screen. <br/>\n(I&#39;m talking about love scenes, not soft or hard porn, and there is a <br/>\ndifference. Modesty is no vice, and we are all better off with creative love <br/>\nscenes.) Males are the ones who have the most problem with sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably males that have the most trouble with *romantic* love scenes, <br/>\ntoo. And this is because romance is creative and difficult work, and because <br/>\nmen don&#39;t like the thought of having competition -- even on the screen. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guarantee that the more graphic the sex becomes on TV or movies, the less <br/>\nromance we will have in our lives, and the harder it will be to return. We <br/>\nwould do well to head in the other direction toward having more romance in <br/>\nmovies, than trying to &quot;open our lives up&quot; to being able to &quot;handle&quot; more <br/>\ngraphic sex.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking it clear to our children that creating is indeed difficult work (and <br/>\nthat destruction is fairly easy), and modeling creative concepts like romance <br/>\nand affection, may go a long way in establishing foundations for them which <br/>\nmay help them avoid the crud.
