It&#39;s a hold out from my childhood.  I advocate it because it&#39;s what I wish for my own peace of mind.  That&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, of course, can advocate all I want, but I can&#39;t stop them from having sex if they really want to do that.  They know this.  So I ask them to wait, hoping they will, knowing that if they don&#39;t I probably won&#39;t even know about it.  So far I have&#39;t known about any of their adult dalliances, either!  (My son and his now-fiance have been sleeping together when they&#39;re here for the last 2 years, at least.  I&#39;m not stupid.  lol.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask them (and they are free not to comply) to wait until the girl is of legal age, too, so they won&#39;t get into any kind of legal trouble.  Jon told me his girlfriend was going to be 18 this month.  She told me she was just going to be 17!  He doesn&#39;t pay much attention to facts like that.  What if she was just about to be 16??  As an 18 yo, that might get him in a lot of trouble.  (It&#39;s moot now, since she broke up with him last night!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Jon not to get any tattoos or piercings until he was 18, either.  I did because I didn&#39;t want him to come to me and say, &quot;Why did you let me do this????&quot;  It&#39;s purely for selfish reasons that I ask for these things.  Because he loves me, he saw my reasoning and didn&#39;t do it.  He was tempted.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the only reason he didn&#39;t, but it&#39;s a factor, and that&#39;s all I can ever hope to be for them.

Just <br/>\nbeing dropped off at movies and picked up right after or with a group at a <br/>\nfriends house with a parent home. Both sexes were involved. No one really <br/>\nhad a boyfriend/girlfriend although there were whispers of who liked who. <br/>\nEven now, a boy and girl can go out for months and unless the boy actually <br/>\nasks the girl to be his girlfriend, they aren&#39;t boyfriend/girlfriend. Go <br/>\nfigure. That&#39;s how it works here. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom experience growing up (and my sometimes irritatingly clear memory of <br/>\nemotional moments), it seemed the stricter the parents were and the more <br/>\nominous weight and power given to -*DATING*- the less casual the kids were <br/>\nable to be when they did -*DATE*- and so I&#39;m thrilled at the non-existence of <br/>\nthe term and concept in my kids&#39; lives so far.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey will sometimes refer to older couples as &quot;going out,&quot; but they seem to <br/>\nmean hanging  out especially much, going to eat together a lot, likely to <br/>\nknow where the other is.   Even those couples who seem established haven&#39;t <br/>\nseemed to have &quot;dated.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s &quot;just semantics,&quot; but I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is eerie lately, because people keep asking here what Holly lately <br/>\nasked or discussed with  me, but...  Friday we were going to pick up a <br/>\nrepaired videotape, and for no known reason Holly asked how long Keith and I <br/>\ndated before we were together.   I had to think hard.  And the story was <br/>\nstrange but I had never looked back from such a distance at it.  He took me <br/>\nto dinner once, having to borrow money to do it, while I was still married to <br/>\nmy first husband.  So it wasn&#39;t &quot;a date,&quot; it was going to dinner while I was <br/>\nin another city.    And he lived in the same house with me and my husband for <br/>\nmonths before we were romantically involved, let alone physically.   So we <br/>\nlived together before we &quot;dated&quot; was kind of the answer, only we never really <br/>\n&quot;dated&quot; and we weren&#39;t &quot;living together&quot; in the being-a-couple way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith parental background like THAT...  sheesh!!<br/>\nIt does allow for a range far beyond the dating rules of my teen years, which <br/>\nwere this:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re fifteen you can date (meaning in a car with one male human)<br/>\nHe must come to the door and chat with parents<br/>\nThey must know where we will be<br/>\nDating limited to Friday, Saturday and Wednesday.  <br/>\nWednesday be back before 10:00<br/>\nFriday and Saturday midnight unless prior special arrangement of 1:00<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was it.  Very simple.  Very arbitrary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was designed to give me time to do homework and such.  So I wouldn&#39;t go <br/>\nwild.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt lasted two years, I left for college right after turning 17, and all rules <br/>\nwere off.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby will be 17 this summer.  He hasn&#39;t done as much stuff as I had done <br/>\nphysically (I was a virgin, he is too, but I had done some drive-in movie <br/>\ntime, and he hasn&#39;t).  He&#39;s done more socially, and mostly in groups of three <br/>\nor more.  He&#39;s more mature than I was.  I&#39;m not worried about him.  But I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want there to be any all of a sudden releases of limitations or <br/>\npressures.  So fifteen was no milestone, and seventeen was no milestone and <br/>\nif he goes away to college, or leaves to live elsewhere I don&#39;t expect he <br/>\nwill act radically different.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59469462,"authorName":"Gerard Westenberg","from":"&quot;Gerard Westenberg&quot; &lt;westen@...&gt;","profile":"leonieann2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Teens: Sex and dating","postDate":"1042356281","msgId":54449,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjkwMWMyYmEwYiRhYzkyYmVhMCRjNzk2OGE5MEB3ZXN0ZW4+","referencesHeader":"PGFhLjE2ZTM4MGY5LjJiNTIwZjM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":54448,"nextInTopic":54455,"prevInTime":54448,"nextInTime":54450,"topicId":54386,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Yes! - over time and experience.

Go <br/>\nfigure. That&#39;s how it works here. Tara has had 4 boy friends now and she&#39;s <br/>\n17. She hasn&#39;t had sex with them all either in case you&#39;re wondering!! I <br/>\nthink the first time she actually went out with a boy alone was when she was <br/>\n15. Again, they met at the movies. This past 6 months with her boyfriend now <br/>\nis the first time she actually has gotten picked up and they go out alone to <br/>\nthe beach, dinner, movie, concerts, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;What about driving in cars with other teens?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTara started going out with a kid she was seeing when she was almost 16 and <br/>\nhe was 17. Again it was in a group in the car in her cousins neighborhood. I <br/>\nknew them all and where they were. Now I have no problem as she only goes <br/>\nwith kids she feels comfortable with. She has actually told me certain <br/>\npeople she won&#39;t get in a car with. I would say now she drives with only two <br/>\npeople. Her boyfriend and her best girlfriend. She gets her own license next <br/>\nmonth. She has also promised she would call if she ever felt unsure about <br/>\ndriving with someone. I trust her instincts and also her boyfriend. He&#39;s not <br/>\na party guy and always safe from what I have seen. And I have seen when he <br/>\nhasn&#39;t realized it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust my daughter judgements, not to say I don&#39;t realize she will still <br/>\nmake mistakes. I figure she will live with someone before she marries. I&#39;m <br/>\nfine with that. I know she has already had sex and now I&#39;m fine with that <br/>\ntoo. (I was a basket case) I&#39;m hoping her marriage will be forever although <br/>\nI&#39;m realistic and she is gun shy about it all. She has seen her own parents <br/>\ndivorce and various aunts and uncles she never thought it would happen to. <br/>\nShe wants children although she swears it won&#39;t be until her late 20&#39;s. <br/>\nShe&#39;s seen me raise her younger 3 siblings and knows what it takes!!! We <br/>\nhave always spoken to her about what we believe and also given her the facts <br/>\nabout it all. I have never said what I wanted her to do or not to do. Tara <br/>\nwill be the first one to say that she listens to it all and then makes her <br/>\nown decisions and learns from her own mistakes. She&#39;s a great kid. A really <br/>\ngreat kid!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

I believe it shows a lack of respect for the young person involved. I also think that it doesn&#39;t work short of locking<br/>\nthem in their room. I used to climb out of the window after my mother thought I was in bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you advocate waitng until marriage for a sexual relationship<br/>\n&gt; or no?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope. That would be hypocritical. I lived with my husband for years before we got married and we actually got married for tax reasons, not because we think a Govt piece of paper is important. A<br/>\npartnership can be loving and sexual without Govt sanction. I also don&#39;t see any problem with exploring sexuality when the young person is ready. It&#39;s their body, not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Is dating something that is determined by the girl or boy&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; desires rather than a predetermined age of elligibility?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Age really means nothing. Some poeple are mature at 13, others at 78. Dating should be up to the person who wishes to do the dating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What about driving in cars with other teens?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not a tricky problem in the UK as very few teens have cars. In fact, I can&#39;t think of anyone I know under 20 who has a car back home. Back home we don&#39;t drive until 17 at the earliest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious how everyone thinks about morality, imparting<br/>\n&gt; values, setting boundaries related to safety and so on.

I assume you mean becoming pregnant? If my daughter became pregnant before she really meant too (and she does know all about contraception) the I would support her fully and help<br/>\nher if that was required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; want to avoid being either too strict and imposing while so lax<br/>\n&gt; that my kids haven&#39;t got anything to bump up against to fo9rm<br/>\n&gt; their values.

Basically, while I share my values and recount my experiences with my children they are seperate human beings and are free to make their own decisions. I feel I will always<br/>\nsupport and love them whatever those decisions are, even if it isn&#39;t something I would have done myself. I&#39;m not them.

Sometimes within those groups a girl and boy <br/>\nhave special feelings for a while.  Sometimes it will split or affect a <br/>\ngroup, sometimes not.   They go to movies and they go to anime club and <br/>\ngaming nights, but not as couple, not as &quot;dates.&quot;  Kirby has done some things <br/>\nwith just one other person and it was a female.  Sometimes it has been his <br/>\ngirlfriend.  He&#39;s had four girlfriends over the past three years.  None at <br/>\nthe moment, but he is friendly with three of those four and two he&#39;s lost <br/>\ntrack of.   One hardly counts.  He met her with groups to hang out at the <br/>\nmall a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has yet to be independently driving and invite a girl he hardly knows to <br/>\ndo a formal date.  I kinda doubt it will ever happen that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;What about driving in cars with other teens?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has several friends who can drive.  Most ohey&#39;re going to go and they <br/>\npark.  We let the kids go.  The law in New Mexico limits new drivers to one <br/>\nperson under 18 who&#39;s not a member of their family.  So usually if one of our <br/>\nkids is with another driver it&#39;s only one of them at a time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe places they go the most are one mile from here, the gaming shop and their <br/>\nfriend Eric&#39;s house, so it&#39;s not much of a problem anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;As a conservative Christian, there is a lot of fear associated with <br/>\nkids making a mistake--either through dating or sexual contact. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of fear about EVERYTHING for conservative Christians. <br/>\nThe Baptists I grew up among (and my relatives who are still Baptist) are <br/>\nuptight for the godly joy of being uptight, it seems.  And are their kids <br/>\nnicer, better, more honest, kinder and more innocent?  Nope.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I was raised without any structure, boundaries or moral compass. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are being raised with what SEEMS probably to others not to be <br/>\nstructure or boundaries, but we talk daily about how they and their friends <br/>\nare getting along, whether they&#39;ve remembered to do this or that regarding <br/>\nsome social obligation, and every situation (Marty&#39;s upcoming birthday party) <br/>\nis planned with consideration for each person involved or affected.  That&#39;s a <br/>\nheck of a moral compass.    Works better than a list of &quot;simple&quot; (arbitrary) <br/>\nrules with times and ages and years and hours.  Each decision they make is <br/>\nmade in light of real considerations, and they know they&#39;ll end up discussing <br/>\nit. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are trusted and respected by adults in all directions.  They impress <br/>\nme sometimes.  I&#39;m surprised at their level of responsibility and <br/>\nthoughtfulness.  Sometimes I expect them to be irresponsible and &quot;just kids,&quot; <br/>\nbut they&#39;re better kids than I was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had a dentist&#39;s appointment Friday morning and had to work Friday <br/>\nafternoon.  His schedule was greatly increased because his boss&#39;s dad had a <br/>\nstroke in another city.   He wanted to spend the night with friends, but I <br/>\nneeded to make sure he got to the dentist.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out his friends live a block from the dentist.  He talked with his dad <br/>\nand me about it, he put his karate gi in the laundry and went to the friends&#39; <br/>\nhouse, where they made sure he had an alarm set, he walked himself to the <br/>\ndentist, and had arranged for a ride to work.  He came home late last night, <br/>\ngot up this morning and got himself ready for work... not a think I had to do <br/>\nto help him for a day and a half.  And he was cheerful and nice to his little <br/>\nbrother and sister.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had made rules about when he had to be home and said &quot;No, you can&#39;t go <br/>\nand visit your friend because you have to go to the dentist tomorrow&quot; or if <br/>\nwe had bugged him about whether he had set his alarm, or whatever all, he <br/>\nmight be harboring some resentment (to say the least).  And if we didn&#39;t give <br/>\nhim a chance to show us that he COULD pull off a two-day schedule that <br/>\ncomplex, we wouldn&#39;t have the opportunity to have as much faith in him as we <br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all developed gradually.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85 &lt;sheran@ptd.net&gt;","from":"&quot;kayb85 &lt;sheran@...&gt;&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Teens: Sex and dating","postDate":"1042329209","msgId":54396,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGF2cWFwcCtpM3RhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGF2cTk0YitiYnNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54386,"nextInTopic":54403,"prevInTime":54395,"nextInTime":54397,"topicId":54386,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
