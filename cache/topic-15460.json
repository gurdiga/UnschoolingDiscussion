There <br/>\nare requirements and suggestions.  Many get those confused.  You are required <br/>\nto keep attendance forms (sheet with places to make checkmarks provided by <br/>\nthe dep&#39;t of nonpublic education), immunizations on file (or the form saying <br/>\nyou are exempt), and to take a nationally standardized test once a year.  <br/>\nThey ask for copies of the test results and attendance be sent in every few <br/>\nyears if they ask.  It sounds worse than it is.  Many people use the Sylvan <br/>\ntest at home on their computer, or get the Hewitt test and self administer.  <br/>\nYou might end up with a support group that wants you to follow all the <br/>\nsuggestions, (such as school for x number of hours in the mornings and have <br/>\nsomeone else administer the tests) but these are not requirements.  There are <br/>\nno minimum scores required for the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the visible hsers I&#39;ve met are affiliated with a church group.  I <br/>\nfound a network of loosely affiliated families that do some activities <br/>\ntogether.  But we aren&#39;t tightly organized.
