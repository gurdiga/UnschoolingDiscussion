It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.  Again, my apologies.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathy<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a message dated 5/19/01 10:50:27 AM Mountain Daylight Time,<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mamkmm2@p... writes:<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; my opinion,<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But unschooling is a parenting issue and a parenting choice, and<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; without<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loosening some controls, parents cannot successfully unschool.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Nine years<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ago I might have said &quot;might not be able to successfully unschool,&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; but after<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years of being at, in and around unschooling, I have seen<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; repeatedly that<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; families unable to loosen up don&#39;t succeed at unschooling, and<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; families who<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do succeed at unschooling loosen up in other areas.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Options are not unlimited, and the definition of unschooing doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; encompass<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all educational options on the whole planet.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sandra<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I even<br/>\n&gt; &gt;hesitate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to point this out, knowing I&#39;ll probably get dumped on by some major<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pyrotechnics, but here goes.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the fact<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can individualize for our children and our family needs.

On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; preclude one another.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say is patently false.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.

On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; preclude one another.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say is patently false.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.

On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>\n&gt; method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>\n&gt; personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>\n&gt; hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>\n&gt; view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>\n&gt; experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>\n&gt; preclude one another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>\n&gt; of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>\n&gt; education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>\n&gt; most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>\n&gt; completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>\n&gt; solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>\n&gt; say is patently false.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>\n&gt; apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>\n&gt; any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>\n&gt; it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>\n&gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.

On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>\n&gt;time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>\n&gt;method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>\n&gt;personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>\n&gt;hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>\n&gt;view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>\n&gt;experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>\n&gt;preclude one another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>\n&gt;of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>\n&gt;education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>\n&gt;most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>\n&gt;completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>\n&gt;solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>\n&gt;say is patently false.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>\n&gt;apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>\n&gt;any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>\n&gt;it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>\n&gt;open what I felt was a serious concern.

I&#39;ve tried to <br/>\nknock off the rough edges.  Your questions gave me the opportunity to <br/>\ntry and put into words things I don&#39;t normally have to.  Labels and <br/>\nabsolute definitions are something that I have always found only <br/>\nquestionalbly useful; although I do believe that some absolutes are <br/>\nfact rather than transient.  So anywho, here it is ..... &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, let me try and answer your first question.  I define <br/>\nhomeschooling as the lifestyle, and unschooling as one method to <br/>\nimplement that lifestyle.  This isn&#39;t exactly what I mean but it is <br/>\nvery close.  To me homeschooling isn&#39;t just an educational choice but <br/>\nthe way we live our lives ... we chose to be in control of our family <br/>\nchoices, including the education of our children.  Now I don&#39;t mean <br/>\ncontrol as in &quot;strangle hold&quot; with no flexibility or sensibilities to <br/>\nour children&#39;s needs and wants (or of the beliefs of others), but <br/>\nmore as in belief in the right to be self-directed without the gross <br/>\ninterference of family, friends, or &quot;well-meaning&quot; agencies or <br/>\ngroups.  Self-directed as parents, as children, and as a family.  <br/>\nBut, with the realization that we are fully accountable for all of <br/>\nour choices and actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, you say that you see unschooling as a door that &quot;requires&quot; <br/>\nyou &quot;to question EVERYTHING. Everything that I accepted growing up as <br/>\nan unquestionable truth, bestowed upon me by trusted grown-ups, is <br/>\nnow open for me to hold up to the light and judge for myself.&quot;  <br/>\nActually that is the definition my husband and I were raised to <br/>\nbelieve came with adulthood in general.  Our parents, traditional in <br/>\ntheir parenting styles and discipline, raised us to understand that <br/>\nthey could raise us as children, but adulthood came after we were <br/>\ncapable of making our own decisions based on our own beliefs ... even <br/>\nif those beliefs wound up being different from theirs.  It is often <br/>\ncalled the &quot;age of accountablility.&quot;  I guess the analogy is that you <br/>\ncan only hold a child&#39;s hand so long before they need to learn to <br/>\nwalk on their own ... and they have the right to fall down or succeed <br/>\nbased on their own choices and skills.  That is also the way we are <br/>\nraising our children ... but more as an issue of maturity than of <br/>\nideology.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is the best way that one of my children learn.  Self-<br/>\ndirected, experiential, with lots of real life application.  She <br/>\nneeds to have more control over things going on around her or she <br/>\nover reacts and stresses out.  I don&#39;t mean that she is bossy or <br/>\nselfish ... just that her personality is best suited towards this <br/>\nmethod at this time.  So long as she continues to progress, as <br/>\nopposed to going stale or plateauing, I will allow her that freedom <br/>\nwihtout putting suggestions in.  Its a choice that I&#39;ve had to make <br/>\nas a parent for her (she is only 5 years old) based on her learning <br/>\nstyle and regardless of how I was at her age.  On the other hand my <br/>\nolder two do much better with directed study and with parameters to <br/>\nwork inside.  My oldest does well with this and will then go into <br/>\nself-directed study ... but won&#39;t do so on her own initially.  My <br/>\nson, 8 years, does not do well without boundaries at all.  He <br/>\nexhibits very poor thinking and decision skills although he has <br/>\nimproved dramatically over the last year.  While it may partly be an <br/>\nissue of maturity ... I know him well enough to know though that this <br/>\nis not the only issue causing these behaviors.  He is a tester and is <br/>\nnot happy until he has found the boundaries that he must live with.  <br/>\nHe has done some very foolish and unsafe behaviors and we have had to <br/>\nchose how to deal with them.  My two year old lies somewhere amidst <br/>\nthese differences and we aren&#39;t pushing her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that I&#39;ve been able to clarify my stance without sounding <br/>\npompous.  It drives me crazy to read something I wrote and later find <br/>\nthat it sounded like I was lecturing.  This is certainly not my <br/>\nintent!  One of the best things about homeschooling to me is the <br/>\nability to individualize for the children and the family.  What works <br/>\nfor me is not necessarily going to work for anyone else.  Even <br/>\nlifestyle choices, methods of implementation, and ideology concerning <br/>\nall of these differ from person to person and family to family.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamkmm2@...\">mamkmm2@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., parrishml@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Kathy -- I&#39;m interested in how you define unschooling.

I even hesitate<br/>\nto point this out, knowing I&#39;ll probably get dumped on by some major<br/>\npyrotechnics, but here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the fact that we<br/>\ncan individualize for our children and our family needs.  No one solution is<br/>\ngoing to work for each and every situation ... thus the various methods of<br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flames are getting high and writers are allowing personalities to<br/>\novershadow the concept of homeschooling here.  In fact, I haven&#39;t heard much<br/>\non unschooling at all ... mostly flames being sprayed venemously when<br/>\nopinions differ.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling at its very heart means complete individualization for the<br/>\nchild&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so individual, the parental approach to<br/>\nthe child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of what that need is) will also<br/>\nbe individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying definitions to extreme on<br/>\nboth sides (i.e., stress, boundaries, fundamentalism, discipline, etc.)<br/>\nrather than accepting individualization needs and definitions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne person may have a child who never needs to be taught about dangers (such<br/>\nas a hot stove) because the information seems innate.  On the other hand,<br/>\nthis same parent may have another child who tests the boundaries of common<br/>\nsense at every turn requiring a stronger discipline by the parent.<br/>\nPersonally I have four children and each child requires a different tact ...<br/>\nfrom an almost hands-off approach to one that requires much more strong<br/>\nboundaries of behavior and consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nA list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in my opinion,<br/>\nthe best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.
