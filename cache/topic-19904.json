I think it&#39;s hard to find definitive reasons for<br/>\npeople and their approach towards the TV. I know homeschooling families<br/>\nwhere the kids are glued to the box for hours, and it&#39;s not to escape<br/>\nschool. My theory is that (as with so many things), there are people who are<br/>\njust more genetically likely to have an unhealthy attraction to it. My DH is<br/>\nfrom a family of 7, and one of his siblings is an alcoholic. The rest of<br/>\nthem can pick up a beer and drink it, no problem. They don&#39;t reach for a<br/>\n2nd, and a 3rd.... So for them, having beer in the fridge is no big deal.<br/>\nFor their brother, it is. I think TV *can* be addictive, but probably not<br/>\nfor most people. For many people, it&#39;s probably like the beer in the<br/>\nfridge - no big deal, but for some it has an overhwhelming attraction. I do<br/>\nthink kids have different reactions to TV, based on their personalities.<br/>\nWhen we had our TV in the living room, my son would stay glued to it for as<br/>\nlong as it was on, and not for lack of other things to do, and definitely<br/>\nnot because his life was too structured, LOL. At the same age, my daughter<br/>\ncould care less. In fact, she typically just won&#39;t watch it at all and when<br/>\nwe rent movies I have to keep going and chasing her through the house, I<br/>\nusually don&#39;t see too much of the movie! So I can definitely see why even<br/>\nhomeschooling families would feel it was in the best interests of their kids<br/>\nto limit or even get rid of the TV, if it was causing a problem for their<br/>\nspecific kids. I can also see how other people who don&#39;t have this<br/>\nexperience with their kids, could easily say &quot;Well, if you just let them<br/>\nwatch as much as they want to, they&#39;ll turn it off. They won&#39;t<br/>\noverstimulate&quot; as if it is always the case that it is the *limits* that<br/>\ncause the problems and not that the limits *come from* the problems. Often<br/>\ntimes when you find a parent who is limiting something, it is because their<br/>\nkid is prone to overstimulation or overattraction to it, not the other way<br/>\naround. In this sense, TV can be &quot;the cause&quot;, even if it isn&#39;t &quot;the cause&quot;<br/>\nof problems for most people. But I also think you&#39;re right in that TV can be<br/>\na crutch or substitute and that when the underlying family issues are<br/>\naddressed, it is used much less.
