Someone said the other day that tuning out is a <br/>\nsign of a problem (and you repeated it here).  That is what worried me.  Back <br/>\nwhen he was in school, he used the TV to tune out on a disturbingly regular <br/>\nbasis.  Now, after 2 years at home, he&#39;s started watching it more again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m looking at what he&#39;s watching, and it&#39;s *stimulating* TV, for the <br/>\nmost part.  Not *tuning out* TV.  There really is a difference.  He&#39;s getting a <br/>\nlot of history, physics, mechanical engineering, biology, etc. with his TV <br/>\ntime.  And some pure entertainment, and I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that, <br/>\neither.  Science fiction shows and anime.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83837,"nextTopicId":83865}}
