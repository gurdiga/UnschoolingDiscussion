When they used to ask, I&#39;d<br/>\nbore them to tears with what the kids are doing -which is exactly the<br/>\n*last* thing they want to hear. lol. so they no longer ask. The other<br/>\nday I got asked if we were sending our 13 yo to a private high school -<br/>\nshe assumed we were, said in  a tone of voice as in &quot;of course you&#39;re<br/>\nnot going to homeschool high school!?&quot;  I said no of course she&#39;s not<br/>\ngoing to a private high school - where ever did you get that idea? end<br/>\nof discussion. If they&#39;re not really interested in what the kids are<br/>\ndoing, go on about that endlessly and they&#39;ll learn real quick not to<br/>\nask. I refuse to justify what we&#39;re doing. Glad to discuss, but I refuse<br/>\nto be interrogated or to have to satisfy someone who wrongly thinks they<br/>\nhave the right to judge what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\nBelieve in what you&#39;re doing and let that show, and put your kids first.<br/>\nWish I had stood up more firmly to the in-laws years ago.<br/>\ngood luck,<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, November 6, 2003, at 08:09  AM, Gary & Lisa Williams wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi all~<br/>\n&gt; How do you respond to family members?<br/>\n&gt; Lisa </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84021,"nextTopicId":84033}}
