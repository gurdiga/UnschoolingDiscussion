What if a kid with <br/>\na really sneaky drug-experimentation project going had his mom take an <br/>\ninterest, and photograph and document it all, and interview his friends, and <br/>\nsend Polaroids to grandma of him posed with his paraphernalia, and make a <br/>\nchart of which drugs he had tried, how many times, and which ones were left <br/>\nto experiment with.

So one afternoon <br/>\nwith a block of time and some money on me, I said &quot;Let&#39;s go get fries,&quot; and <br/>\nthe two of us went.  I said &quot;Let&#39;s try all the drive-through places&#39; fries <br/>\nand see which are best.  I thought Blakes.  He thought maybe Wendy&#39;s.  We <br/>\nwent to Sonic (chile cheese fries!), Burger King, Blakes, and I forget where <br/>\nelse (four places, I think, though) before he was saying &quot;No more mom, let&#39;s <br/>\ngo home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a long time before he said &quot;fries.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t do it out of hostility or sarcasm, but just as a goofy thing to do.  <br/>\nThe effect was such, though, that I would consider the method in future if I <br/>\nreally wanted to get someone OFF of a fixation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77615025,"authorName":"Sue","from":"&quot;Sue&quot; &lt;werapfamily@...&gt;","profile":"werapfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] For parents of Toddlers/potty training","postDate":"1024742608","msgId":38554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDkwMWMyMTlkOSRhNTQ1NWZlMCQxNjAwYThjMEBzdWViPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFiOS4yMWVmMDY1LjJhNDRiYTMwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38553,"nextInTopic":38557,"prevInTime":38553,"nextInTime":38555,"topicId":38414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... least ... finding ... the ... to ...

When he was<br/>\nabout 18 months old, I put a potty chair in each of<br/>\nthe bathrooms. I bought potty chairs that looked like<br/>\n&quot;little toilets&quot;, because in my mind, it would make<br/>\nmore sense to the little guy, but I don&#39;t really know<br/>\nif that made a difference or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I just left them there. Nothing else. He saw<br/>\nothers using the big toilet, and eventually wanted to<br/>\ndo the same. He was potty trained by the time he was 2<br/>\nyears, 3 months (except night time, which came quite a<br/>\nbit later.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is just my experience with one, and our<br/>\nyounger son, Will, is now 20 months old, so we&#39;ve<br/>\nplaced the potties again!

So disgusted and frustrated withe the rashes I told him that that was it. No more diapers. As of the following morning Shawn was in regular underwear-not training pants- and has had 3 night accidents and probably 3 wet and 3 poop accidents in these last 4 months. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think so much of it has to do with KNOWING your child.  Apparently he was ready--which is good because I was sooooo ready. He was 3.5 yrs old when I finally put my foot down. My daughter who is now 14 months old, regularly goes to the toilet to sit on and usually pees at least once a day on it (will go to sit perhaps 3-5 times). This is purely her own initiative. We have not done potty chairs, only the inserts. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth Ali<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Amy Thomlinson <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, June 19, 2002 1:57 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] For parents of Toddlers/potty training<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My first son at age of 28 months  told me he was a big<br/>\n  boy and he didn&#39;t wear diapers  and he never had an<br/>\n  accident until public school.    The second one  I<br/>\n  introduced a potty chair (which he picked out)  for<br/>\n  his 2nd birthday the potty chair was only used a<br/>\n  couple of times.   Finally at his 3rd birthday we made<br/>\n  an agreement that if he wouldn&#39;t wet his pants  he<br/>\n  didn&#39;t have to wear a diaper  and he got to pee on the<br/>\n  tree of his choice in our back yard.   I bought<br/>\n  several boys swimsuits  because it is easier to pull<br/>\n  up and down just one thing than shorts and underwear<br/>\n  both.   He used the tree to pee when we were home  and<br/>\n  peed his pants any other time  and always just did #2<br/>\n  in his pants.  Now he is almost four  and I realized<br/>\n  sometime over the winter he decided the toilet was<br/>\n  better then exposing himself out in the cold  and he<br/>\n  never has accidents.   I suppose he just was ready<br/>\n  finally.   From what I have heard from other people <br/>\n  the more you try to force kids to toilet train the<br/>\n  more resistance you get from them.   Anytime you can <br/>\n  let him use cloth training pants or underwear  that<br/>\n  way he gets the icky feeling of getting and staying<br/>\n  wet until he takes his underwear off.  Otherwise you<br/>\n  probably should just let him figure it out.<br/>\n  --- AprilWells &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawnwells@...\">dawnwells@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; I have taken a wait and see approach to my son&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; potty awareness.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I was wonder about everyone&#39;s experiences with this<br/>\n  &gt; and looking for idea&#39;s.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Currently here is what I do.

Then he got sick and <br/>\nhad to have his appendix out that August. We spent 18 days in the hospital <br/>\nand they put him in diapers since he couldn&#39;t get out of bed for a while. I <br/>\nthought when we came home it was going to be so hard to get him out of <br/>\ndiapers, but it wasn&#39;t. He went right back to using the potty by himself. <br/>\nBefore the hospital, he was still not accident free at night, but when we <br/>\ncame home, he had really changed. People picking and poking at him really <br/>\nbothered him. (understandably) He told his dad that no one was going to be <br/>\nbugging him about the potty any more and he wouldn&#39;t have any more accidents <br/>\nat night, because he didn&#39;t want to be touched! I felt so bad for my little <br/>\nguy, it was so hard for him. But on the upside, he was so determined, he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have any more accidents. <br/>\nOTOH with his older sister, I had all sorts of pressure from people like my <br/>\nMIL who swore all her kids were potty trained by the age of 18 months, that I <br/>\nworked constantly with Moly and the result was a child who resisted using the <br/>\npotty for two years. She finally did it on her own at 3 1/2 almost 4. But <br/>\nstill had accidents at night until she was almost 7. I learned later from <br/>\nDarin&#39;s older sister that all the kids in the family might have been potty <br/>\ntrained at 18 months, BUT had continuos accidents until 7 or 8 and one of <br/>\nDarin&#39;s older brothers had night accidents up into his teens! <br/>\nI will never (if I ever have any more kids) push the potty!!!

One of the main reasons that unschooling appeals to me is that I have seen how my son does things better and easier on his own time. Potty training was one of those things. We got the potty seat at 2. Just talked about it a bit and then left it there. Jason showed no interest. Sometime around 3 I started talking to him about using the toilet, being aware of the signs. Somewhere around 3.5 I started panicking wondering if he really would do it on his own. I thought that he was ready (he would ask me to use the bathroom at the pool but never at home). I convinced him to wear training pants (cotton) one day. He had 3 accidents within a couple of hours that morning...the funny thing is that he never goes to the bathroom that much that early normally. I took that to mean &quot;back off mom&quot;! LOL! I backed off, just kept talking about when he was ready he would do it. Just occasionally. Kept looking for what would motivate him. Then his best friend potty trained and started talking about his batman underwear. Jason said that it sounded cool (I had mentioned getting underwear to him before, but he had never shown any interest). We went shopping and bought batman, thomas the tank, bugs bunny, taz you name it. We put them on when we got home. He had one accident outside in the garden the next day and that was it. He was trained literally overnight (poop and pee). I kept him in pull-ups at night, but after a few weeks, I realized that I was not even checking to see if he was wet in the morning. Started checking and found out that he was dry and we were night time trained. Had 3 night time accidents that is it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was ready and he did it. Luckily I actually felt (and feel!) that diapers were easier, so I was willing to wait. The hardest part was dealing with people who kept telling me that he would never do it on his own, that I would have to &quot;make&quot; him. The funny thing is, these same moms (whose kids were actively trained by or before 3) were still having poop issues at 4.5 (one still got a &quot;poopy&quot; prize for pooping on the toilet and the other was into major control issues and refusing to poop on the toilet). Going to the bathroom is not an issue here...never has been. I never sat and read stories. We never watched toilet training kid videos. I never made Jason try to go before we went out...if he said he did not have to go, he didn&#39;t. We never had to reward him for going. It really was incredibly easy. And as far as I can tell, he is not behind in any way because he was &quot;late&quot; to train LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Kyle, my 2 yo is already asking to use the toilet occasionally and actually pooped in it the other day LOL! But he has the motivation of seeing his big brother use it and wanting to be like him. I actually found myself trying to convince him that he did not want to use the toilet the other day...now I have to worry that Kyle will want to wear underwear before he is really ready. But that seems to be the story of my life...trying to convince my 5 yo that he can brush his own teeth while explaining to my 2 yo that mommy still needs to do his.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing how Jason really does have his own timetable for doing things (potty training, getting himself dressed, talking, writing his name you name it) has really led me to unschooling. He has time and time again shown me that if I let him take the lead, he will do and learn what he needs to. And if I try to impose my schedule on him, I will run into a brick wall.... now if I can just remember that...<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck. It will happen. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":27496206,"authorName":"Amy Thomlinson","from":"Amy Thomlinson &lt;diamond_h2o@...&gt;","profile":"diamond_h2o","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] For parents of Toddlers/potty training","postDate":"1024520274","msgId":38418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNjE5MjA1NzU0LjQzMzI1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMzAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNEMTBFMEQ3LjUwNzA1MDBAY294Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":38416,"nextInTopic":38419,"prevInTime":38417,"nextInTime":38419,"topicId":38414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My first son at age of 28 months  told me he was a big boy and he didn t wear diapers  and he never had an accident until public school.

The second one  I<br/>\nintroduced a potty chair (which he picked out)  for<br/>\nhis 2nd birthday the potty chair was only used a<br/>\ncouple of times.   Finally at his 3rd birthday we made<br/>\nan agreement that if he wouldn&#39;t wet his pants  he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to wear a diaper  and he got to pee on the<br/>\ntree of his choice in our back yard.   I bought<br/>\nseveral boys swimsuits  because it is easier to pull<br/>\nup and down just one thing than shorts and underwear<br/>\nboth.   He used the tree to pee when we were home  and<br/>\npeed his pants any other time  and always just did #2<br/>\nin his pants.  Now he is almost four  and I realized<br/>\nsometime over the winter he decided the toilet was<br/>\nbetter then exposing himself out in the cold  and he<br/>\nnever has accidents.   I suppose he just was ready<br/>\nfinally.   From what I have heard from other people <br/>\nthe more you try to force kids to toilet train the<br/>\nmore resistance you get from them.   Anytime you can <br/>\nlet him use cloth training pants or underwear  that<br/>\nway he gets the icky feeling of getting and staying<br/>\nwet until he takes his underwear off.

Or if a more rigorous option is needed.~<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as my potty training experience went - they did it when they were ready. If I tried to force them, it never worked. It just got everyone upset and angry. The summer is the best time to just let them go natural. Supposedly this, allows them to make more of a connection between their bodily functions. Also having the diaper sometimes keeps them a little too dry - and therefore they don&#39;t tend to associate going in the potty with being dry. Now, using this method we had lots of accidents! - but most could be cleaned up pretty easily. I would add that my 3 yr. old daughter still uses a pull-up at night. I have tried stopping the drinks at 6 PM etc. but I always felt mean - when they cry for a drink - so that didn&#39;t last. A pull-up seems easier than having to change sheets in the middle of the night. My son was about 3 when he was totally potty trained. As much as we tried to get him to go in the potty he just wouldn&#39;t. Then all of the sudden we were at a friends pool party - and he decided he wanted to go to the potty. and he pretty much was potty trained from then on - even at night. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I think that yes, children will just do it when they are ready. Someone once said to me - how many adults do you see still in diapers? (ones without incontenience of course ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather A.
