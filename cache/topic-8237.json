All our arguments, including faxes from <br/>\nClonlara showing their accredidation, went for naught.  Eventually Chris was <br/>\n&#39;allowed&#39; to enlist during one of the windows in which the Army &#39;temporarily&#39; <br/>\nlowers its standards in order to meet quotas :)  So he could enlist as a <br/>\nnon-highschool grad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was told that the Air Force is not so stinky; I don&#39;t know about the <br/>\nNavy/Marines.  But I suspect all the services have those windows, because <br/>\nthey all have quotas to meet.  And if your child can do well on the testing <br/>\nthe services give, they will find a way to enlist the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hjshaltz@...\">hjshaltz@...</a><br/>\nHJS Studio and Shaltz Farm Shetlands and Angora Rabbits<br/>\nList Mom, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberFlock@onelist.com\">FiberFlock@onelist.com</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberProfessionals@onelist.com\">FiberProfessionals@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8203,"nextTopicId":8238}}
