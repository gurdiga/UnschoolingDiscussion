Being that he has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1899000085\">Hi Sheila,\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI have had the same issue that you describe with your daughter with my son.<br/>\nMy oldest son 13, goes for days without a shower. Being that he has reached<br/>\npuberty, for me it has been not as much of an issue as it has been for my<br/>\nhusband.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nHe also USED to be with way with brushing his teeth. He would go for days,<br/>\nweeks even sometimes without brushing. \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMy husband would constantly nag him about it to the point when he would just<br/>\ntune him out kind of like it seems that your daughter does to you from what<br/>\nyou wrote. For me, I let it go and never pressured him about any of it,<br/>\nbecause I did not and do not want brushing and showering to be made to feel<br/>\nlike a &quot;punishment&quot; because if it is, then the resistance is much worse. It<br/>\nis kind of like being in &quot;school&quot; and being forced to learn what we never<br/>\nwanted to learn in the first place, we resist that to because we choose to<br/>\nlearn what, where, when, why and how we wish to learn, which is why we<br/>\nunschool is it not?\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThere are times now where he will surprise me and my dh and shower. I<br/>\nremember a time a few weeks ago when my dh and I went grocery shopping<br/>\n(Chris being 13 will stay home and watch his two younger brothers ages 6 1/2<br/>\nand 8) and when we returned, I had noticed he had changed his clothes, but<br/>\ndid not say anything. Later, Chris had announced that while we were gone, he<br/>\nhad showered. I said great honey I am glad. I try not to make too much of a<br/>\ndeal of whether he showers or does not shower simply because I know if I do,<br/>\nit will make showering seem like a good/bad &quot;thing&quot; to do and I want him to<br/>\nshower because HE wants to and he enjoys it and keeping himself clean, not<br/>\nbecause it is good or bad to do or not to do.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThe only thing I will do is every once in a while give a gentle reminder<br/>\nhere or there if his brothers have bathed or if I have just gotten out of<br/>\nthe shower, I might say something like &quot;The shower is all yours Chris&quot;. I<br/>\nnever tell him about how bad he may or may not smell. To him, this is a blow<br/>\nto his self esteem, because it makes him feel as if he is not &quot;good enough&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;not good enough for me or others to be around him&quot; simply because he is<br/>\ndirty or smelly. Not to mention the fact that what may seem like smelly to<br/>\nus, may not be offensive to them simply because they do not know what their<br/>\nown bodies threshold is for smell. I know for Chris, it will take until he<br/>\ncan physically smell himself as smelly or dirty before he will shower or put<br/>\ndeodorant on. Me or anyone else merely reminding them of the fact that they<br/>\nsmell, not only makes him feel self conscious and bad about themselves, but<br/>\nit also does not enable them to find their own threshold to know. Just like<br/>\nwhen you feel you need a shower, it is not because someone has told you you<br/>\nare smelly, but it is in fact, because you yourself can feel or sense or<br/>\nactually smell that you are not clean.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAlso, you modeling the behavior of showering, putting on deodorant everyday<br/>\ncan help tremendously. It may not seem like it, like it conveys alot, but it<br/>\ndoes. If you show your daughter daily that you take pride in yourself, your<br/>\nappearance, and your body, then she is more likely to see that and take<br/>\npride in herself. This could be why she was interested in showering if you<br/>\ndid her toenails afterwards. She needs someone to show her how to be pretty<br/>\nin a way she feels comfortable with, and modeling that in that way does go a<br/>\nlong way. Maybe you could have a &quot;make over&quot; date just you girls, where you<br/>\nshower (separately if she wishes her privacy, and then do each others hair<br/>\nand makeup, and maybe even let her play dress up with some of your<br/>\nclothes!:) \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nRather than talking down to my kids about how good it is for them to be<br/>\nclean, I would rather want to make it an activity to enjoy. I want my kids<br/>\nto find enjoyment in loving and caring for their bodies, not it being a<br/>\nsomething that they &quot;have to do&quot;. So I say he USED to do this with teeth<br/>\nbrushing up until 6 months ago, because one day about 6 months ago, he came<br/>\nto me and asked me &quot;Mom, can we go to Walmart today?&quot; Of course, I am<br/>\nthinking he wants the newest computer or electronic gadget right? He<br/>\ncontinues&quot;because, I would like to pick out my own toothpaste and my own<br/>\ntoothbrush because I do not like the toothpaste here in the house and my<br/>\ntoothbrush hurts my teeth and I want to have something of my own&quot; WHOA!!!<br/>\nBlew me over with a ton of bricks! :)\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nNeedless to say, he had &quot;deschooled&quot; toothbrushing and was ready to move on<br/>\nin life. And I dropped everything and immediately took him to Walmart,<br/>\nquietly celebrating on the inside. What Chris needed was the time and space,<br/>\nWITHOUT nagging and pressure to see the value of keeping his teeth healthy<br/>\nall on his own because HE wanted too, not because someone was telling him<br/>\ntoo! Patience and time was what was needed on my part, something as a parent<br/>\nwhich is much easier for me to do than most. I think that for me it is<br/>\nbecause I am in tuned with my kids rhythms and movements through life more<br/>\nand I have no problem giving them as much time as needed to work through<br/>\nwhatever it is they need to.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMost parents, like my husband, are so into the fact that they have to be<br/>\nneat and clean that they forget that our children are individuals and need<br/>\nto be respected enough for them to figure out the value of something and<br/>\nthat in doing so it takes ALOT of time and patience.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nSo now, every night I hear his toothbrush twirling (he got one of those<br/>\nCrest electric ones!:) and I smile on the inside.
