I am lucky to have a terrific husband who supports us.(even if <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t understand all the time) We only had one glitch, this<br/>\ntime <br/>\nlast year two of my son&#39;s friends went to the local schools <br/>\nkindergarten roundup (I find it interesting that the local district <br/>\ncalls enrollment into kindergarten a roundup!) and the next thing I <br/>\nknew my son was clamoring at me to go to school. My normally <br/>\nsupportive husband informed me that if I were really giving the kids <br/>\ntotal choice, then I should allow him to go... Long story short, next <br/>\nweek is the absolutely, positively last week of school! And it<br/>\nisn&#39;t <br/>\ncoming soon enough for me or my son!
