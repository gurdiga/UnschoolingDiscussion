I&#39;m not sure how I would react to a friend or family lied to me, I<br/>\n&gt; guess it would depend on the circumstances.  I have broken off friendships<br/>\n&gt; because of events which involved lying but they also involved cruelty and<br/>\n&gt; spite so dishonesty was only a symptom of bigger problems.<br/>\n&gt; Kris<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how I react to a family member lying to me, I get mad.<br/>\nI lived with it for too long, one son was picking it up getting him grounded<br/>\nfor up to<br/>\ntwo months at a time, he eventually figured out that lying to me was a<br/>\nbigger crime than telling the truth and having me find out his misdeeds<br/>\nfirst hand from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI listened as my step-father lied about my bruises etc, I listened as my ex<br/>\ncontradicted himself in a single sentence, never sure in the end which part<br/>\nof his stories was the truth.   It wasn&#39;t ever on anything of any real<br/>\nimportance, just little lies, in some ways that made it worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSue </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16214,"nextTopicId":16223}}
