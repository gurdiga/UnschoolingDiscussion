So to hell with everyone else who may come to your <br/>\nhouse. If they don&#39;t like it, they can go elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I have company, I go to no extra ordinary measures in our house. About <br/>\nthe only thing I will do that I normally don&#39;t do is frett where everyone is <br/>\ngoing to sit to eat. I have a very large dining room but unfortunately only <br/>\na table that seats 8 in a tight squeeze. So I get crazy with the card table <br/>\nand long folding table and if I have enough folding chairs. Other than that, <br/>\nthe house is as it usually is. The kids will clean their rooms from the <br/>\nclutter just so they can play in there if other kids are coming. So I keep <br/>\nthings as is, if people don&#39;t like it, tough. Nothing in my house is new, <br/>\nit&#39;s all second hand. I don&#39;t have a showcase here. Just one that I keep as <br/>\nneat and clean as I can. So no different measures here for company.

There is all kinds of ribbons, glitter, buttons, <br/>\npom poms, pipe cleaners, wiggly eyes, etc.  They do their own thing <br/>\nwith it.  They also have free access to glue, paper, markers, tape, <br/>\nyarn, etc. My dad owns a flea market so I get a lot of free crafty <br/>\nstuff for them to play with there.  I don&#39;t think you have to plan a <br/>\nwhole lot of cute little crafts for kids to make them happy (unless <br/>\nthey specifically want you to of course).  Just give them access to a <br/>\nbunch of stuff and let them have fun with it.  My kids have all kinds <br/>\nof creations taped to walls all over the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLately they&#39;ve been pretending they&#39;re cats.  They get bowls of dry <br/>\ncereal, milk, and water and put it all over the house.  Then they <br/>\ncrawl around on all fours and eat it.  And they cleared a whole <br/>\nbookshelf full of toys out of the family room to display their beanie <br/>\nbabies.  They divided the family room up into different &quot;houses&quot;.  <br/>\nThey take containers out of the kitchen filled with water so that <br/>\nthey can wash their &quot;kitty&quot; dishes when their done.  They invite me <br/>\nto their &quot;houses&quot; for dinner.  When my daughter wants to play house <br/>\nand wants me to be her kid at the same time my son wants me to play <br/>\nhouse and be his cat and they start fighting over it, I have to be <br/>\ncreative and find a way to make everyone happy.  (I ended up being a <br/>\nkid who could turn into a cat, which led me to tell them that I think <br/>\nthey would really like the movie Shaggy Dog).  That&#39;s the creative <br/>\nstuff I&#39;m talking about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut giving kids free access to craft stuff, tons of toys, and letting <br/>\nthem eat pretend cat food in bowls makes for a messy house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: this list has forced me again","postDate":"1045968074","msgId":59440,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlZi4yYTY0NzMwLjJiODk4ZWNhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59439,"nextInTopic":59441,"prevInTime":59439,"nextInTime":59441,"topicId":58116,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/22/03 7:02:09 PM, mummyone24@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1402210077\">In a message dated 2/22/03 7:02:09 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Mary B (who&#39;s husband ripped all the wallpaper off the kitchen walls today <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did you WANT him to?  <br/>\nOr did he just hate lunch and there it went?<br/>\n<br/>\n(joking)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband had an unexpected big sink drain repair in the kitchen, involving <br/>\n(of course) an odd-sized hose, a dishwasher, a garbage disposal, two fully <br/>\nbroken pieces of metal...

I&#39;m learning to just be<br/>\nwho I am (which is a very creative, lots of projects, lots of play<br/>\nkind of person who doesn&#39;t have the time or energy to clean a house<br/>\nlike a lot of people do) and to be happy about being who I am.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing happy with who we all are is the most important thing. Because then we <br/>\nwill be happy about who are kids are too. Not worrying about some standard <br/>\nset about by &quot;other&quot; people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI envy you for being crafty. I find it very hard to do. I don&#39;t naturally <br/>\nthink along those lines. I don&#39;t naturally think about how to do crafty <br/>\nthings. My kids love it. So I force myself. I actually have to. I get on the <br/>\ninternet late at night and sometimes spend hours looking for things I know I <br/>\ncould present and that my kids would enjoy doing. I have a great sense of <br/>\naccomplishment when my kids are done and they are happy with their finished <br/>\nproducts. It takes a lot for me though. Christmas was so trying that <br/>\nValentines day went by without a single craft. Okay my kids didn&#39;t ask, but <br/>\nI&#39;m sure if I would have mentioned it they would have wanted to do <br/>\nsomething. I&#39;ll try for Easter. But it really is a chore for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning isn&#39;t like that for me. I guess maybe I&#39;ve been like that all my <br/>\nlife. It&#39;s easy for me to do. I enjoy doing it and it&#39;s also important for <br/>\nme. To be neat and clean. To have a place for everything. So THAT&#39;S part of <br/>\nwho I am. I&#39;m also blessed with great kids that allow me the time to do <br/>\nthose things. Joseph is 8 and Sierra is 7 and they play so well with each <br/>\nother most of the time and of course the 2 year old follows right behind <br/>\nthem. They play with her well also. So that alone gives me the time to do <br/>\nwhat I want. I grab those times to clean. Being that I clean every day, <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t that much to do even though my house is rather big. Mopping <br/>\nevery day actually takes less time than if I did it once a week. The floor <br/>\nis practically spotless anyway and cleaning something that isn&#39;t real dirty <br/>\ntakes less time. That&#39;s my secret. I actually have one of those clorox mops <br/>\nand mop the whole floor once a day and spot mop like 3-4 times. Same with <br/>\ncleaning bathrooms and such. I do one load of laundry every day. That way I <br/>\ndon&#39;t get overwhelmed and spend hours doing it at the end of the week. Being <br/>\nthat these things take less time, I can grab 20 minutes while the kids eat <br/>\nbreakfast or lunch. I can grab 20 minutes when all 3 take a shower. (my <br/>\nhusband takes charge of that every night) I can grab 20 minutes while they <br/>\nwatch Rugrats or go and visit grandma next door. 20 minutes 2 or 3 times a <br/>\nday amounts to a lot of time to clean something. I also make sure that if <br/>\nsomeone needs me, to reach something they can&#39;t or just listen to a story of <br/>\ntheirs, I stop what I&#39;m doing. That&#39;s when cleaning can wait. About the only <br/>\ntime I try to schedule uninterrupted is when the carpets get cleaned. I have <br/>\nmy own machine. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s time management. That&#39;s the key. That and being happy with ones <br/>\nself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B (who&#39;s husband ripped all the wallpaper off the kitchen walls today <br/>\nand provided me with plenty to handle without being anal)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122926724,"authorName":"Rachel Ann","from":"Rachel  Ann &lt;hindar@...&gt;","profile":"salixj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] this list has forced me again","postDate":"1045961666","msgId":59437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNTgxQkMyLjAwMDAwNy4wMTc2OEBBbm9saWNrRmFtaWx5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEY3NGFWSTdJN0hQRVpjVjFValIwMDAwN2RhNUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59436,"nextInTopic":59438,"prevInTime":59436,"nextInTime":59438,"topicId":58116,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well heck, I ve been sick all this bloody month and the house sure shows it!

It seems to go quick and more times <br/>\nthan not, without asking, I have one child at least behind me picking <br/>\nsomething up also.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir rooms I ask for a path, as I always have. I also ask for them not to <br/>\nplay right in the doorway. Other than that, their rooms definitely look <br/>\nplayed in. Joseph was up until about 2:00 last night cleaning his room and <br/>\nalso playing some. He says he wants to finish it today. I haven&#39;t vacuumed <br/>\nin there for at least a week and a half. The girls room I was able to vacuum <br/>\ntoday for the most part except for a small area around Alyssa and her <br/>\nBarbies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the house is mine and it&#39;s more than enough to satisfy my <br/>\ncleaning urges. I always mop and vacuum every day so &quot;our&quot; part of the house <br/>\nis great and the kids part.....well looks like the kids part. And I&#39;m <br/>\nactually okay with that. If nothing else, I&#39;ve managed to get a hold <br/>\nsomewhat of my need to have absolutely everything neat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the kids are happier, my husband and I are and the house still looks <br/>\npresentable, just more like kids live here. That&#39;s not a bad thing! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

Not <br/>\nsure whether I will still say thanks in a month!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Mary B from two weeks ago.  I was thinking about this stuff more.  My <br/>\nhouse isn&#39;t as clean as most people would like their houses.  I mopped the <br/>\nkitchen the other night at 9:30.  It was the first time over a month it had <br/>\nbeen more than just swept or spot-cleaned.  If I hadn&#39;t broken a glass, it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have been cleaned the time before this.  So if a neatnik came to my <br/>\nhouse and I said &quot;Don&#39;t make them help&quot; she might run screaming that I was <br/>\ncrazy and she was going STRAIGHT home to make her kids clean house.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she might be right.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I want help doing something, I gauge it against what the kid&#39;s already <br/>\ndoing.  If one kid is just kinda bouncing a ball or watching my  husband cut <br/>\nwood, I&#39;ll probably ask that one before I&#39;ll ask the one who&#39;s on the phone <br/>\nor playing with a friend.  It&#39;s not easy to describe.  I think because I <br/>\nprize human interaction, I like to think of chores more as a human <br/>\ninteraction opportunity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I don&#39;t ask anyone for help.  Sometimes I ask EVERYONE for help, if <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to have company or we need a big clear space to do a big project.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut because human interaction is more important to me than sanitation and <br/>\nhome decorating, then  my advice is skewed that way.   I almost want to be <br/>\napologetic, but then I remind myself that this list is about unschooling and <br/>\nrelated parenting and logistics stuff, and not about home-perfection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose there might be sites or lists about how to keep your home totally <br/>\nphoto-ready, but I wouldn&#39;t want to be on one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I see a little mess and I wonder whether it&#39;s worth the disruption <br/>\nor interuption or unhappiness that would be caused by me going and as<br/>\nking/making the kid clean it, or berating him in front of a friend.  <br/>\nSometimes the answer is &quot;Yes, worth it,&quot; and more often it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can buy peace and happiness by picking up candy wrappers or cereal <br/>\nbowls, sometimes I do that joyfully.  Little voices in my head sometimes say <br/>\n&quot;You&#39;re training them to leave things lying around.&quot;  But my own voice says <br/>\n&quot;They&#39;ve picked up after me, willingly, and peacefully, and they will again <br/>\nif I don&#39;t screw this relationship up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"this list has forced me again","postDate":"1044567028","msgId":58116,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0NVduT2NSQWxLdkswTG5Rc24wMDAxNDQ2MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59423,"prevInTime":58115,"nextInTime":58117,"topicId":58116,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"to question what I hadn t before.

I have mentioned before that once a day we all usually clean up what s all ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2103278540\">to question what I hadn&#39;t before.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy now you all know what a clean neat freak I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have mentioned before that once a day we all usually clean up what&#39;s all <br/>\nover the floor. My kids are always asked and I always expect that a no <br/>\nanswer would be okay. I never get a no except from Alyssa. (naturally, she&#39;s <br/>\n2!) So the kids always pitch in and help and there hasn&#39;t been any problems <br/>\nwith the way it&#39;s been going. But lately I&#39;m starting to be more aware of <br/>\nthem asking me for things that aren&#39;t restricted. I think maybe that&#39;s just <br/>\nthe way the kids are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch as, there&#39;s always a basket of candy available to all to eat. It&#39;s <br/>\nalways within reach and I never say no when they ask. But the kids always <br/>\nask anyway. They always ask to go outside even though the answer is always <br/>\nyes. (out in back that is) If one asks to go out, I say yes and then the <br/>\nother two will ask anyway, even though they KNOW it&#39;s okay. The kids even <br/>\nuse to ask me if they could get out of bed when they were little in the <br/>\nmorning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I started to think that maybe me asking for clean up time is just <br/>\nsomething they figure they can&#39;t say no to, since none of them ever have. So <br/>\nas smooth as it&#39;s all been going, I decided to change that. My husband isn&#39;t <br/>\nexactly happy and thinks I&#39;m nuts but what else is new?<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat down with the 3 kids and explained everything to them. I still would <br/>\nlike the parts of the house where everyone goes to be kept neat. As in <br/>\ndining room and hallway. No one ever plays in the living room or kitchen <br/>\nmuch at all. When those parts are cluttered, I&#39;ll start cleaning up and then <br/>\nask for help if I want it. The playroom and their bedrooms are up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a little apprehensive as to how this will all go. I&#39;m hoping I can keep <br/>\nmy sanity about it all. It&#39;s been a few days and so far the things on the <br/>\nfloor have been few and far between. Not what I expected. Yesterday the <br/>\ndining room was full of play doh and afterwards, all 3 cleaned up everything <br/>\nthey were playing with. I always clean the leftover play doh myself. Last <br/>\nnight the girls room was messy with loose beads all over the floor. I wanted <br/>\nto vacuum so I just picked them up myself. The stuff on the floor in the <br/>\nplayroom was minimal. Today the playroom is spotless. They&#39;ve been in their <br/>\nrooms all day. Not sure what hey look like now. I&#39;ll let you know how things <br/>\ngo in the near future.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband seems to think not asking every night and just doing it myself <br/>\nwill make them see me as a maid. I don&#39;t see it that way and he&#39;s promised <br/>\nto keep his mouth shut! So thanks for helping me question some more. Not <br/>\nsure whether I will still say thanks in a month!! I feel now that I was <br/>\nbeing coercive in that I was asking too much. Does that make sense??<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44037,"nextTopicId":59509}}
