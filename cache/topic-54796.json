Thanks for responding!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is very talkative and imaginative. She likes to tell <br/>\nstories....all day long!! :) She likes to read, but she has <br/>\ndysgraphia and cannot write well. She has Asperger&#39;s and often can&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand directions (verbal or written). She doesn&#39;t do well in <br/>\nmath either. I am not concerned as to how fast she learns, but she <br/>\nreceives disability and periodic re-evaluations are necessary. Her <br/>\nlast evaluation was recently, and the psychologist says she <br/>\nhasn&#39;t &quot;progressed&quot; in her academics and wants me to do all this <br/>\nmajor &quot;school-at-home&quot; stuff that I don&#39;t really agree with. (I <br/>\nthink learning little by little is good for her and gives her self-<br/>\nconfidence.) But how do I justify days when she wants to listen to <br/>\nChinese music, wants to play video games, and wants to tell me <br/>\nstories? How do I write that down in records? Do I have to say she <br/>\ndid such-n-such, beginning at such-n-such a time and ending at such-<br/>\nn-such a time?
