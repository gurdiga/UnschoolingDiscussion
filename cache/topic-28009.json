If the kidlets were ever forced to attend school, that is where they<br/>\nwould go.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe contracts under a charter school.  The charter pays the rent on a<br/>\nbeautiful new two story house that is walking distance from the university<br/>\nand lots of other neat things to see and do.  She has twenty students<br/>\nranging in age from 6 to 18.  They take off on week long camping trips,<br/>\nthey&#39;ve been to DC and places like the Shakespeare Festival.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt anyrate, I digress.  There are a few of the kids that have various<br/>\nallergies.  At the beginning of the year they studied allergies and as a<br/>\n&quot;community&quot; came up with a plan work and live around those allergies.<br/>\n<br/>\nA kids were interviewe for a local program and the general concensus was<br/>\nthat they were so glad they went to this school.  For the kids with<br/>\nallergies they said that they no longer felt like &quot;freaks.&quot;  For the kids<br/>\nthat didn&#39;t have allergies they said that they were glad they went to this<br/>\nschool because they hadn&#39;t even known how bad allergies could be and had<br/>\nalways at &quot;regular&quot; ps just thought the kids with allergies were &quot;weird.&quot;<br/>\nOne little girl, I think she was about 6, said &quot;I&#39;m glad they have allergies<br/>\ncause . . .&quot; and then stumbled along trying to explain that she didn&#39;t mean<br/>\nshe was glad they had allergies but glad they were in her school because now<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t think they were weird.  She ended it by saying, with a look of<br/>\nwow, &quot;I didn&#39;t know fake food could taste so good.&quot;  Meaning things like<br/>\nnon-dairy cheese.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be done, just takes folks with the right attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 19, 2001 6:57 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Food Allergies, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/19/2001 7:01:01 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That our right to bring peanut butter to school is more important than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; having Jessie and Mark there?
