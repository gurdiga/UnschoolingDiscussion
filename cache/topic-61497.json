I would never say, &quot;I&#39;m homeschooling using Story<br/>\nStretchers.&quot;  It&#39;s just a book that happens to one my shelf this month<br/>\nand next month I&#39;ll probably have a different book on my shelf about a<br/>\nsimilar topic.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut the key is that it&#39;s *not* there because I think there are things I<br/>\nhave to teach.  I don&#39;t think that at all.  My son learns amazing things<br/>\neach day that I&#39;ve never taught him.  Last night he wanted me to get off<br/>\nthe computer so he could practice spelling words in Microsoft Word.<br/>\nHe&#39;s not quite 5, and I&#39;ve never asked him to do any spelling.  He<br/>\nwanted to learn to spell words, but doesn&#39;t want to use pencil and paper<br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t quite have the fine motor skills to write letters<br/>\nhe&#39;s happy with.  He&#39;ll learn to spell, and type, and someday even write<br/>\nwith pencil, and I won&#39;t have to teach him any of it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe reason I have Story Stretchers on my book shelf is because my son<br/>\nhas lots more energy than I do, and frequently his desire to do things<br/>\nis far ahead of my creativity.  I used the example of painting with<br/>\nstring as something I&#39;ve gotten out of an education manual.  There&#39;s no<br/>\nreason on earth I feel children need to be taught to paint with string.<br/>\nBut he&#39;s always asking to &quot;make stuff&quot; and I can only pass him the white<br/>\npaper and crayons so many times before I realize I&#39;m holding him back by<br/>\nmy lack of creativity.  If he never wants to do another craft project<br/>\nagain, that would be fine with me (I&#39;d probably be relieved.  Crafts are<br/>\nnot my forte).<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope I&#39;ve made things more clear, but I&#39;ve probably managed to muddy<br/>\nthem up further.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"Wife2Vegman","from":"Wife2Vegman &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Now that I think of it...","postDate":"1048401790","msgId":61661,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzIzMDY0MzEwLjExMDczLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzIzMDU0MzM2LjE3ODM5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61657,"nextInTopic":61673,"prevInTime":61660,"nextInTime":61662,"topicId":61497,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Elizabeth Roberts  wrote: Yes I did leave that part out intentionally.

When I first joined, I came in here with &quot;both guns blazing&quot;, sure I knew what unschooling was and is, and sure I was doing it, and immediately jumped into a confrontation with Sandra over something or other, and left in a huff. (psst...Sandra was right, too, about that other thing, and I was wrong)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI slunk in again about 4 or 5 months ago, and was determined to just lurk forever and glean what I could use and toss what didn&#39;t suit me.  That didn&#39;t work.  Instead, I found myself questioning the way I did things that didn&#39;t fit the unschooling lifestyle.  And those things that didn&#39;t &quot;suit&quot; have become a nice fit.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly urge you to just lurk and read for a couple weeks to a month or even longer, like I did.  Read the archives, which alone will take you a couple months if you spend hours each day.  Read the new posts every day, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get the urge to post, hold off a while until you hear how others respond.  Several times I have wanted to throw my hat into the ring, but waited and within 24 hours someone had either answered my question or had posted exactly the response I was going to give or had posted a response that was the opposite of my initial reaction since I am still learning how to unschool myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Corner of Lurkdom, I have seen that many times new posters say things like &quot;My 3 year old won&#39;t learn the alphabet and how to read unless I teach him&quot; instead of saying, &quot;How will my 3yo learn the alphabet if I don&#39;t teach him?  How did your children learn?&quot;  I have observed that the first type of post brings a totally different type of response than the second one.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYour questions will be answered, even if you don&#39;t ask them.  In fact, your questions have already been asked, many times, by other newbies, and then answered, many times, by Sandra and others, and it is in the archives.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going back into Lurkdom now, since my true unschooling journey is only 6 months old, even though I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 9 years, and all nine have been stepping stones to where I am now...I still have much to learn from this list before I will feel comfortable commenting or offering my thoughts here.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan M. in VA<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling 3 great people who are 13, 11, and almost-5<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Maybe I haven&#39;t been very<br/>\nclear on that, and for that I&#39;ll apologize.

I personally<br/>\n&gt; like to have a few<br/>\n&gt; &quot;instructor&#39;s guides&quot; for early childhood education<br/>\n&gt; out of the library<br/>\n&gt; at any given time.  Not because I buy into their<br/>\n&gt; absurd &quot;lesson plans&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; but because sometimes my son will say something<br/>\n&gt; like, &quot;Let&#39;s make<br/>\n&gt; stuff!&quot; and since I&#39;m somewhat craft-impaired, I<br/>\n&gt; like to have something<br/>\n&gt; to flip through so I can say, &quot;Would you like to<br/>\n&gt; make something with<br/>\n&gt; homemade clay or paint with a string?&quot;  Or if there<br/>\n&gt; are a lot of<br/>\n&gt; pictures, he can browse it and let me know what<br/>\n&gt; projects look fun.  If<br/>\n&gt; we were relying on my lack of craft imagination, it<br/>\n&gt; would be crayons and<br/>\n&gt; white paper every time.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; But if I were to sit down with one of the books and<br/>\n&gt; take their<br/>\n&gt; suggestions seriously, that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;  I mean, one of the<br/>\n&gt; books I have out of the library has an &quot;integrated<br/>\n&gt; thematic unit&quot; on<br/>\n&gt; apples, complete with objectives, vocabulary words,<br/>\n&gt; and assessment<br/>\n&gt; criteria.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  But it does have a<br/>\n&gt; recipe I might try<br/>\n&gt; sometime.  I like the fact that through the library<br/>\n&gt; I can keep changing<br/>\n&gt; the books, because honestly these types of books<br/>\n&gt; have about 10 or 15<br/>\n&gt; good ideas per 500 pages.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s sometimes hard to see the difference between<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and other<br/>\n&gt; forms of homeschooling.  I mean, one parent might<br/>\n&gt; use an early childhood<br/>\n&gt; curriculum book to actually sit down for two hours<br/>\n&gt; each morning and do a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;lesson&quot; on each &quot;unit&quot;.  That&#39;s not unschooling by<br/>\n&gt; any definition.  It<br/>\n&gt; could be the very same book I have on my shelf to<br/>\n&gt; pull out when my son<br/>\n&gt; wants to do something and I&#39;m fresh out of ideas.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Sorcha<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I think not. I&#39;m not at<br/>\nall bound by their suggestions or timeline or anything<br/>\nlike it is.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone was saying that.  I personally like to have a few<br/>\n&quot;instructor&#39;s guides&quot; for early childhood education out of the library<br/>\nat any given time.  Not because I buy into their absurd &quot;lesson plans&quot;,<br/>\nbut because sometimes my son will say something like, &quot;Let&#39;s make<br/>\nstuff!&quot; and since I&#39;m somewhat craft-impaired, I like to have something<br/>\nto flip through so I can say, &quot;Would you like to make something with<br/>\nhomemade clay or paint with a string?&quot;  Or if there are a lot of<br/>\npictures, he can browse it and let me know what projects look fun.  If<br/>\nwe were relying on my lack of craft imagination, it would be crayons and<br/>\nwhite paper every time.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut if I were to sit down with one of the books and take their<br/>\nsuggestions seriously, that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.  I mean, one of the<br/>\nbooks I have out of the library has an &quot;integrated thematic unit&quot; on<br/>\napples, complete with objectives, vocabulary words, and assessment<br/>\ncriteria.  It&#39;s ridiculous.  But it does have a recipe I might try<br/>\nsometime.  I like the fact that through the library I can keep changing<br/>\nthe books, because honestly these types of books have about 10 or 15<br/>\ngood ideas per 500 pages.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s sometimes hard to see the difference between unschooling and other<br/>\nforms of homeschooling.  I mean, one parent might use an early childhood<br/>\ncurriculum book to actually sit down for two hours each morning and do a<br/>\n&quot;lesson&quot; on each &quot;unit&quot;.  That&#39;s not unschooling by any definition.  It<br/>\ncould be the very same book I have on my shelf to pull out when my son<br/>\nwants to do something and I&#39;m fresh out of ideas.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Now that I think of it...","postDate":"1048395564","msgId":61645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMuY2Y1NzE2NC4yYmFlOTkyY0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61638,"nextInTopic":61647,"prevInTime":61644,"nextInTime":61646,"topicId":61497,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/22/03 8:58:09 PM, ladyeliza_r@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2059613249\">In a message dated 3/22/03 8:58:09 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ladyeliza_r@...\">ladyeliza_r@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Does it mean that if I<br/>\ndon&#39;t rush into this without a full understanding and<br/>\nconsideration that I&#39;m bound to ruin my children&#39;s<br/>\nlives? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot &quot;bound to&quot; but you do run more risk of wasting time than if you read and <br/>\nhonestly consider the ideas people are sharing with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the ellipesis, did you leave out the part about reading a while before <br/>\nposting?<br/>\n<br/>\n[ &quot;(If) you&#39;d like<br/>\nto find out more about how video games and life in<br/>\ngeneral are filled with learning, come join<br/>\nus!...Everyone with an interest in unschooling is<br/>\nwelcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you<br/>\nkeep in mind the purpose of this list, which is to<br/>\ndiscuss unschooling in ways designed to help each<br/>\nother become unschoolers or become better at<br/>\nunschooling.&quot;]<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106031689,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Now that I think of it...","postDate":"1048392142","msgId":61638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PCF+IVVFTkVSa1ZDTURrQUFRQUNBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUJnQUFBQUFBQUFBb3RjOXlYdVBJRXV3MzdFd2ZJRzhMTUtBQUFBUUFBQUFzcUNZRTZTL2hrYUFPVmpCOC9ab1hRRUFBQUFBQGF0dGJpLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzIzMDMxMDQ5LjY3MjcxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61626,"nextInTopic":61645,"prevInTime":61637,"nextInTime":61639,"topicId":61497,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are lots of us unschooling in MA.

MY rigid wrist<br/>\nguards were off &#39;cause I FORGOT them  after changing<br/>\nTed over from shoes 2 sk8s, he is boarding and inline<br/>\nsk8ing. My internist broke her wrist inlne sk8ing a<br/>\ncouple of years back WEARING IDENTICAL GUARDS.  There<br/>\nare no guarantees.<br/>\n<br/>\nSk8ing is dangerous, done skillfully MORE so, as is<br/>\nmost kid-type biking.  What fun! But someone biffs it<br/>\nbad on sk8s, boards or (next door to the sk8park) at<br/>\nthe BMX bike run every couple of weeks here--we see<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my kids will continue to want to wear their<br/>\npadding/helmets. At least they said they will remind<br/>\nme to wear mine, they see how much my broken arm sux,<br/>\nand they also know that I REALLY believe that if I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t forgotten the guard, I MIGHT have just bruised<br/>\nit instead----wahhhhhhh &lt;g&gt;...<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have pads or helmet as a kid, I crashed<br/>\nbikes, sk8s and boards regularly, nothing ever broken<br/>\nbut knees scarred to heck STILL, bonked head, jambed<br/>\nfingers, bad bruises, a scab somewhere always!<br/>\nI have ALL kinds of safety gear as an adult, for<br/>\nmyself and the kids (and extras). I think some of it<br/>\nis well made and does protect, but how well?? Dunno,<br/>\nreally, but I use it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI did START putting helmets on them as naturally as<br/>\nbreathing from the first time they toddled over to a<br/>\ntrike-they see me wear mine 2 bike 2...they have never<br/>\nasked if they HAVE to wear them, they think they are<br/>\nquite cool.  Mine is purple, has flames and anime<br/>\nstickers, what can I SAY? &lt;wink&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a pretty steep 7+ foot deep bowl @ our<br/>\nsk8park, Ted fell right into it his first day out (of<br/>\ncourse!) got the wind knocked out pretty hard @ was<br/>\nglad of his helmet. (Me too)!<br/>\n<br/>\nWould I FORCE them to wear the safety gear? No. With<br/>\nthis, like with everything else, I try to set an<br/>\nhonest example using my best judgement, and talk about<br/>\nit sometimes out loud while considering the options.<br/>\nAnd I talked some about my own consequences, so they<br/>\nsee I am not beating myself up over making a mistake<br/>\nand forgetting something!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait till my arm heals, I have a **BRAND NEW**<br/>\nYu-Gi-Oh sk8board (blue, dark Yugi), prezzie from my<br/>\ndh &lt;smile&gt;!  4 weeks 2 go till I back in action on it.<br/>\n{Huzzah for HEALTH INSURANCE!!}<br/>\nLoving this list,<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
