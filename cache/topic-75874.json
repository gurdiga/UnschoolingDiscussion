I sent Helen an individual note, talking about what I believe was her <br/>\nvery inappropriate behavior regarding Sandra on this list. I sent it directly <br/>\nbecause I wanted to model a perhaps more appropriate way to handle a conflict <br/>\nthan skewering someone on a large list, out of the blue. Helen, you obviously <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI HAVE seen Sandra tell people to grow up. I have never seen her do that with <br/>\nsomeone who was genuinely trying to learn and understand what unschooling and <br/>\ntrusting their children were all about, even if they were slow or making LOTS <br/>\nof mistakes. It&#39;s always been in the context of someone so intent on proving <br/>\nthey&#39;re right that they disrupt the list. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to say that Sandra, or any of us, is perfect. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe there is a need for more lists. If so, they&#39;ll be successful. If <br/>\nnot, they&#39;ll disappear. No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, Helen, I think you have something else going on with Sandra, and you&#39;re <br/>\ntaking your stuff out on her (and frankly, the rest of us).  Your comments are <br/>\ngetting more and more nasty, cutting, and divisive. For the life of me, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t figure out why. I don&#39;t know if it matters. But I expected better from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn, who believes we should be kind to one another, gentle when we can <br/>\nbe, and deal directly with conflict when it arises<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44312,"nextTopicId":75887}}
