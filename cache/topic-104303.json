At age 5, I sometimes had to ask her to repeat something 2 or 3 times before I could figure out what she was saying because of her pronounciation of some sounds.

He did develop a stuttering<br/>\nproblem at age 3 which went away without therapy by the time he was 4.  The<br/>\ndoctor said his brain moved faster than his mouth could which caused him to<br/>\nnot stutter like d-d-d- but to hold the first syllable longer than he should<br/>\nand that he would grow out of it, and he did.  He is now 13 and he&#39;s still<br/>\ntalking up a storm.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second child was uneventful and had no therapy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy third child had 1 word at age 2.  2 months from being 3 I took him to his<br/>\npediatrician who did not suggest speech therapy, rather that he was just a<br/>\nlate bloomer.  My cousin&#39;s wife suggested Keep Pace who did implement Speech<br/>\nTherapy and offered a diagnosis.  I contacted a developmental pediatrician<br/>\non my own and was soon given a diagnosis the same as Keep Pace&#39;s.....autism.<br/>\nHe is now 4 and attends private therapy 4 times a week, 2 speech 2<br/>\noccupational.  He also has been enrolled in public school since the day<br/>\nafter he turned 3 in the Special Education Early Childhood program (PPCD)<br/>\nwhere he gets more speech and occupational therapy.  Without early<br/>\nintervention and massive doses of therapy in my 3rd child&#39;s case he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe making the progress he is now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is important for parents to address their concerns about their<br/>\nchildren without being overly paranoid.  Not every child needs to be put in<br/>\nspeech therapy, but some do.  Have faith in your pediatrician, but if you<br/>\nstill feel that something just isn&#39;t right then take it a step further and<br/>\ndo a little investigating of your own.  If the child truly has a speech<br/>\nproblem, then yes definitely get the therapy necessary to help that child<br/>\nbut give the child a chance first!<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit my webpage!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dtoygal.com\">http://www.dtoygal.com</a><br/>\nDawn Powell<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Earthmomma67@...\">Earthmomma67@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Earthmomma67@...\">Earthmomma67@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 09, 2005 7:47 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Speech Therapy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 3/9/2005 7:39:58 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nI would love to hear what people have to say about this.<br/>\n*************<br/>\nOut of the hundreds of children that I have been exposed to  over the years,<br/>\nhomeschoolers, preschoolers, daycare kids, at home kids, There has been only<br/>\none child, Kaden, who was understandable at two.
