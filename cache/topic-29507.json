They had a problem with the no seeing colors or hearing music <br/>\nthing.  Those things are such an important part of both of their <br/>\nworlds they can&#39;t imagine living without.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  No travel.  No far off lands to imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Someone else chooses your career and your life is regulated by <br/>\nage.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  The end meant different things to each of them, for one,  the <br/>\nkid, whose name I forget, doesn&#39;t find civilization.  He is <br/>\nhallucinating and he dies at the bottom of the hill.  For the other, <br/>\neven though he found others, it may or may not have been better and <br/>\nthe people he left behind were left to cope with a situation they had <br/>\nno way to understand because of generations of total control.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  On a deeper level, they were thinking about how a society like <br/>\nthat could develope . . . how people could give up so much in the <br/>\nname of being safe.  Of course it&#39;s even scarier to think about now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1665","postDate":"1007696657","msgId":29507,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMxN2VkMSQ3ZWFjYzEwMCRkOGE3YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDc2NzkyMjcuMjAxMy44NTI3MS5tMTFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29565,"prevInTime":29506,"nextInTime":29508,"topicId":29507,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Could you elaborate?
