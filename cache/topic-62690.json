She was cremated on <br/>\nher own land, near Boulder, by friends who researched and built an open <br/>\nfuneral pyre.   I wasn&#39;t there, but I&#39;ve been told stories.   I might have <br/>\nsomething in writing, so when the time comes if you haven&#39;t found enough <br/>\ninformation, write to me on the side.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had a permit and advisement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI live where we&#39;re not supposed to burn trash, but I grew up where we WERE <br/>\nsupposed to burn trash and just take the ashes to the dump, so we had a trash <br/>\nbarrel and it was my job to do that.  Fire has always been fun and <br/>\nfascinating for me, so I would arrange elaborate trash-sculptures with <br/>\ncardboard-tube vents and the wet exciting stuff or chemical stuff down low in <br/>\nthe middle, and light it just so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, kinda without thinking, after I lived in Albuquerque, I lit a 55 gallon <br/>\ntrash barrel thinking it would just burn quickly and I wouldn&#39;t get in <br/>\ntrouble.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVery bad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I grew up on 2.5 acres and farming/rural, dogs went to crap <br/>\nwherever---at the ditch, in the neighbor&#39;s orchard, on an already existing <br/>\npile of horse shit.   Nobody picked that stuff up.  It was part of the <br/>\nground.   In Albuquerque we pick it up and we don&#39;t burn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...<br/>\nThis BARREL with various things including probably at least a cubic foot of <br/>\ndog poo, started to smoulder.  Not flame, just kind of cook.  And it made <br/>\nhorrid smoke which was blowing RIGHT into my neighbor&#39;s back yard, where my <br/>\nneighbor who is in her 60&#39;s and not very fun was working.  AND she has had <br/>\ntwo house fires in her life and so doesn&#39;t even like the fact that we have <br/>\nand use a fireplace next door to her.   <br/>\n<br/>\nVery bad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI kinda casually put dirt in the barrel until the fire went out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when my husband finally took that to the dump, it was dirt and baked <br/>\ndoodoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so if you do cremate your cat, consider where the aroma of burning fur  <br/>\nmight waft.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a cat graveyard at our house, and a friend has brought two of her <br/>\ncats because she lives in an apartment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62832,"nextTopicId":62671}}
