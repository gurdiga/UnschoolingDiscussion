One was from<br/>\nanother group I belong to and the other I found while reading the one from<br/>\nthe other group I belong to (Did you follow all that? :)\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI found them to be very thought provoking and make ALOT of sense...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ru.org/83wright.html\">http://www.ru.org/83wright.html</a> (this is the one I found, really powerful!)\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/bell.htm\">http://www.freechild.org/bell.htm</a> (this is the one I got from the other<br/>\ngroup and a bit about it below)\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nUNDERSTANDING ADULTISM\r<br/>\nTo be successful in our work with young people, we must understand a\r<br/>\nparticular condition of youth: that young people are often mistreated\r<br/>\nand disrespected simply because they are young. The word &quot;adultism&quot;\r<br/>\nrefers to\r<br/>\nbehaviors and attitudes based on the assumption that adults are better\r<br/>\nthan young people, and entitled to act upon young people without their\r<br/>\nagreement, writes John Bell. This mistreatment is reinforced by social\r<br/>\ninstitutions, laws, customs, and attitudes. If you think about it, you\r<br/>\nwill realize that except for prisoners and a few other institutionalized\r<br/>\ngroups, young people are more controlled than any other group in\r<br/>\nsociety.\r<br/>\nAs children, most young people are told what to eat, what to wear, when\r<br/>\nto go to bed, when they can talk, that they will go to school, which\r<br/>\nfriends are okay, and when they are to be in the house. Even as they\r<br/>\ngrow older, the opinions of most young people are not valued; they are\r<br/>\npunished at the will or whim of adults; their emotions are considered\r<br/>\n&quot;immature.&quot; In addition, adults reserve the right to punish, threaten,\r<br/>\nhit, take away &quot;privileges,&quot; and ostracize young people when such\r<br/>\nactions are deemed to be instrumental in controlling or disciplining\r<br/>\nthem. If this were a description of the way a group of adults was\r<br/>\ntreated, we would all agree that their oppression was almost total.\r<br/>\nHowever, for the most part, the adult world considers this treatment of\r<br/>\nyoung people as acceptable because we were treated in much the same way,\r<br/>\nand internalized the idea that &quot;that&#39;s the way you treat kids.&quot; For this\r<br/>\nreason, writes Bell, we need to hold adultism up to a strong light.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n Patti and the boys (Chris 12, Matthew 7, Anthony 6)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92875,"nextTopicId":92899}}
