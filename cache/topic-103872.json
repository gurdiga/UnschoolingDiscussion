I didn&#39;t really<br/>\ncare, but my dh wanted it pretty badly.  He loves TV.  Eventually, satellite<br/>\nTV became affordable.  We got it.  I would miss it terribly now if we didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave it.  Several years after we&#39;d had satellite TV for a while, cable<br/>\nfinally became available.  Dh had been wanting cable high speed internet and<br/>\nso we switched to cable TV and high speed internet.  Cable sucked compared<br/>\nto Satellite TV.  With satellite TV we got twice at many good channels for a<br/>\ncheaper price.  So, we kept the high speed internet but went back to<br/>\nsatellite TV.  My favorite channels are the Outdoor Life Channel and RFD TV<br/>\nwhich both have a lot of horse shows and horse training shows on them.   I<br/>\nget to watch Monty Roberts in action, the Parelli&#39;s, and don&#39;t forget<br/>\nClinton Anderson complete with his lovely Australian accent, among other<br/>\nwidely known natural horse trainers.  Couldn&#39;t get that accent from a book.!<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;    My kids still love PBS, but Animal Planet ranks up there pretty high.<br/>\nDh and I also love history related channels and dh loves movie channels.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have had free access to TV for several years now with no remarks<br/>\nfrom mom as to its value.  Because of this list I&#39;ve been able to get to the<br/>\npoint where I can watch TV without feeling guilty that I should be being<br/>\nmore useful.  TV isn&#39;t the central part of our lives, but we all enjoy it<br/>\nnow when we do watch it.   Watching horse training is great, but turning<br/>\naround and applying what you learned to your own horse is even better.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Digest Number 5196","postDate":"1109128873","msgId":103895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4OUFENjk5LTg1NDktMTFEOS05OUNDLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGN2Z2hxaSs4aGZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGN2Z2hxaSs4aGZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":103893,"nextInTopic":103901,"prevInTime":103894,"nextInTime":103896,"topicId":103872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
