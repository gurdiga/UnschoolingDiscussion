My<br/>\nfirst intro to HSC was through the Refugio (beach north of Santa Barbara)<br/>\ncampout and it was love at first sight!  After the campout we went to the<br/>\nconference that summer and my family had a blast.  I know some folks have<br/>\nsaid the conference is not unschooly enough, but gosh I don&#39;t know what a<br/>\nmore structured person would find to do with their time at an HSC conference<br/>\nbecause its all we talk about (unschooling-respectful parenting etc.).<br/>\nMaybe its just the folks the other poster was hanging out with, but there is<br/>\njust this large group of unschoolers at this conference meeting up as often<br/>\nas we can.   We spend less time going to sessions and more just hanging out<br/>\nat the pool or walking around checking on our kids (that would be me &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\nWhat I first noticed about the HSC campers and the same folks that attend<br/>\nthe conferences regularly was the respectful interactions with their<br/>\nchildren and that is what keeps me coming back.  I have to quote a friend of<br/>\nmine, mom to four grown and almost grown unschoolers (first wasn&#39;t) when she<br/>\nattended her first campout she said &quot;I have found my people&quot; : ) !<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89140,"nextTopicId":89286}}
