Or follow <br/>\na map for that matter.  I either enlist help or spend 8X the amount of time <br/>\nany other peron would to get through it.  I figure someday, either I&#39;m going <br/>\nto get so sick of being lost or paying to have everything preassembled that <br/>\nI will force myself to figure it out or live with it.  My children aren&#39;t <br/>\nany different if I allow them to be.  Which I do.  I can see that she is <br/>\nalready becoming frustrated with being unable to read and she has started <br/>\nasking for regular instruction.  So what if she will be 7 in two weeks.
