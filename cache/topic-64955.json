Not <br/>\n  at all in<br/>\n  &gt; my comfort zone and I think my comfort zone is generally pretty <br/>\n  wide.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n  My best friend and I were discussing this last night.  Admittedly, I <br/>\n  was a bit taken aback by an 8 yr old wearing a bra in public.  BUT, <br/>\n  once we started talking, I gained a whole new perspective. We (bgf <br/>\n  and I) went to high school with a girl named Michelle, who dressed <br/>\n  like a boy and went by the name Mitch in school.  She even used the <br/>\n  boys restroom, all of it.  Most people didn&#39;t even know she was a <br/>\n  girl, so I assume the teachers even called her Mitch.  Not sure <br/>\n  though as I never had a class with her, we just rode the bus to and <br/>\n  from school together.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, we started talking about Michelle and if she were our own <br/>\n  child, if we would allow her to use a men&#39;s restroom in public.  <br/>\n  Eventually, we both agreed we would.  (This ended up being about a 2 <br/>\n  hour conversation.)  I recall seeing a show on Maury Povich about <br/>\n  transvestites/transsexuals and one mother/son couple really amazed <br/>\n  me.  The mother completely accepted her son as a woman.  Called her <br/>\n  by her feminine name and introduced her as her daughter.  It had <br/>\n  been over 10 years since she had seen her &#39;son&#39; and the purpose of <br/>\n  the show was for the moms to see their boys again.  She cried like a <br/>\n  baby when he walked out in a suit.  He was ok with that.  They both <br/>\n  looked at it like this mother had lost her son, almost like he had <br/>\n  died and she now had a daughter.  She viewed them as two different <br/>\n  people.  He knew she accepted him now as a woman but let her grive <br/>\n  the loss of her son.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Basically, my point is this... I&#39;m NOT suggesting an 8 yr old that <br/>\n  wears a bra is gay nor wants to be a woman.  BUT, what if in the <br/>\n  future, he does??  I don&#39;t see how stifling his needs now will ever <br/>\n  help him, or his relationship with his parents or anyone for that <br/>\n  matter.  Maybe he simply wants to be like his Mom!  Obviously, he is <br/>\n  very well grounded and self confident, otherwise he couldnt take the <br/>\n  flack he gets in public and occasionally from his best pal.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Our children need to feel love and acceptance from us at every <br/>\n  moment in their lives.  I would not allow my child to use drugs <br/>\n  because our golden rule has been, &#39;so long as it doesn&#39;t harm <br/>\n  yourself or others&#39;.  My brother died from a heroine overdose, it <br/>\n  was the first time he used it.  My children are very aware of that, <br/>\n  as Mike only passed away a year ago.  I do struggle with whether or <br/>\n  not I should allow my 12 year old to dye her beautiful blonde hair <br/>\n  black and hot pink, but I&#39;m working on it and have not said no, I <br/>\n  just havent said yes yet!.  I think we all, as parents, have <br/>\n  our &#39;ideals&#39;, our wishes for our children.  But they are not us.  <br/>\n  They have to carve their own path and we must follow them with our <br/>\n  arms and hearts open wide.  Sometimes, it just takes a different <br/>\n  perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just something to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Admittedly, I <br/>\nwas a bit taken aback by an 8 yr old wearing a bra in public.  BUT, <br/>\nonce we started talking, I gained a whole new perspective. We (bgf <br/>\nand I) went to high school with a girl named Michelle, who dressed <br/>\nlike a boy and went by the name Mitch in school.  She even used the <br/>\nboys restroom, all of it.  Most people didn&#39;t even know she was a <br/>\ngirl, so I assume the teachers even called her Mitch.  Not sure <br/>\nthough as I never had a class with her, we just rode the bus to and <br/>\nfrom school together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we started talking about Michelle and if she were our own <br/>\nchild, if we would allow her to use a men&#39;s restroom in public.  <br/>\nEventually, we both agreed we would.  (This ended up being about a 2 <br/>\nhour conversation.)  I recall seeing a show on Maury Povich about <br/>\ntransvestites/transsexuals and one mother/son couple really amazed <br/>\nme.  The mother completely accepted her son as a woman.  Called her <br/>\nby her feminine name and introduced her as her daughter.  It had <br/>\nbeen over 10 years since she had seen her &#39;son&#39; and the purpose of <br/>\nthe show was for the moms to see their boys again.  She cried like a <br/>\nbaby when he walked out in a suit.  He was ok with that.  They both <br/>\nlooked at it like this mother had lost her son, almost like he had <br/>\ndied and she now had a daughter.  She viewed them as two different <br/>\npeople.  He knew she accepted him now as a woman but let her grive <br/>\nthe loss of her son.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, my point is this... I&#39;m NOT suggesting an 8 yr old that <br/>\nwears a bra is gay nor wants to be a woman.  BUT, what if in the <br/>\nfuture, he does??  I don&#39;t see how stifling his needs now will ever <br/>\nhelp him, or his relationship with his parents or anyone for that <br/>\nmatter.  Maybe he simply wants to be like his Mom!  Obviously, he is <br/>\nvery well grounded and self confident, otherwise he couldnt take the <br/>\nflack he gets in public and occasionally from his best pal.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur children need to feel love and acceptance from us at every <br/>\nmoment in their lives.  I would not allow my child to use drugs <br/>\nbecause our golden rule has been, &#39;so long as it doesn&#39;t harm <br/>\nyourself or others&#39;.  My brother died from a heroine overdose, it <br/>\nwas the first time he used it.  My children are very aware of that, <br/>\nas Mike only passed away a year ago.  I do struggle with whether or <br/>\nnot I should allow my 12 year old to dye her beautiful blonde hair <br/>\nblack and hot pink, but I&#39;m working on it and have not said no, I <br/>\njust havent said yes yet!.  I think we all, as parents, have <br/>\nour &#39;ideals&#39;, our wishes for our children.  But they are not us.  <br/>\nThey have to carve their own path and we must follow them with our <br/>\narms and hearts open wide.  Sometimes, it just takes a different <br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust something to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87403280,"authorName":"Jeff & Kate Kerr","from":"Jeff & Kate Kerr &lt;windystreet@...&gt;","profile":"saffronwoman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Another parenting question","postDate":"1050514566","msgId":65103,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFOUQ5NDdELjM4ODRFNjJBQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":65092,"nextInTopic":65119,"prevInTime":65102,"nextInTime":65104,"topicId":64955,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-689853514\">*** &lt;encadia@a...&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n                     &lt;&lt;Now this I haven&#39;t heard of.

With a 24 yo son who navigated successfully through the teen years and a true devotee of teens, I think","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-128670248\">Kristen, I have been thinking about your question.  With a 24 yo<br/>\nson who navigated successfully through the teen years and a true<br/>\ndevotee of teens, I think that in dealing with peer pressure or a<br/>\ndesire to do something undesirable to the parents, the key is to<br/>\nbe specific and concrete - and ready to listen to why you are<br/>\nwrong.  That has to build on the relationship and the<br/>\nconversations you have already had of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 8, my mother told me I could leave any time.  Now sit<br/>\nback down and pick up your jaw.  It was the best and most loving<br/>\nthing imaginable, because what she told me was that any<br/>\n&quot;obedience&quot; was a matter of choice.  At 8 it was quite likely<br/>\nthat I could manage reasonably well on my own in many ways.  I<br/>\nthink she was wrong, but she had been told the same thing at 8,<br/>\nwhen perhaps it was accurate.  The point she was making and that<br/>\nI took from the conversation to raise our kids has been  that<br/>\nlistening to parents is a choice that they are free to make or<br/>\nnot..  That is a bottom line truth you can&#39;t get around, whether<br/>\nor not you say so openly.  For me knowing that I was free - and<br/>\ntelling our kids explicitly that they were free to chose how<br/>\nheavily to weigh our opinion is very beneficial honesty.  You<br/>\nhave to be worth listening to - not hip or permissive or blind,<br/>\nbut clear headed and reasonable and articulate<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example - with no warranty that any specific discussion was<br/>\nhad with any particular child, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrugs and alcohol - perfectly normal and acceptable behavior.<br/>\nThe drive to intoxication is found even in rats.  Arrest records<br/>\nsuck; some drugs have serious and immediate consequences for some<br/>\npeople.  From there it was very easy to get to the place that he<br/>\nand his friends were perfectly welcome to drink at our house,<br/>\nprovided they brought a toothbrush (no DUI&#39;s allowed, that<br/>\nendangers others with your choice).  The couple of friends he had<br/>\nwho would drink to excess if given a chance didn&#39;t get invited<br/>\nback for the all night gaming sessions and band jams - they<br/>\ntended to throw up or pass out and not be any fun.  Pot similarly<br/>\nshould not be smoked on the lakeshore in the well known drug<br/>\nselling spot.  One is likely to score an arrest.  Come home, but<br/>\npreferably smoke it outside; the smell lingers.  Do not use any<br/>\nintoxicant often enough that you are in the habit of living in an<br/>\naltered state or that your normal state is overly concerned with<br/>\nfunding intoxication.  Be aware of your sources for illegal<br/>\ndrugs - remember their interest is in their profits, not your<br/>\npleasure.  They are marketing just as seriously as the Saturday<br/>\nmorning cartoon advertisers.  If you want something very<br/>\nseriously illegal along those line, let me or Dad get it for you;<br/>\nwe really are more worldly wise as to risks and how tos (2<br/>\nlawyers are like that, LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally illegal activities - the &quot;malum in se&quot; is &quot;malum&quot;<br/>\nwhether or not prohibited.  The &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; should<br/>\ngenerally be avoided as a general respect for legitimate<br/>\nauthority.  Specific cases are open for full exploration.  Thus,<br/>\nat 13 I taught him to drive. Not because I was a fan of illegal<br/>\ndriving, but because we live in the middle of no where.<br/>\nViolating the age restriction on driving was balanced with a<br/>\npersonal safety issue of being able to skeedaddle if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad Company/&quot;Losers&quot; - Where you spend your time develops your<br/>\nhabits and determines a lot of your future.  Don&#39;t use a<br/>\nchocolate cake mix hoping for oatmeal cookies.  Investigate<br/>\neverything you like, but do not neglect to evaluate what you<br/>\ninvestigated.  The shaved head phase of teenaged-ness only lasted<br/>\none hair cut cycle, thank God.  I never thought he would be a<br/>\nskin head at any serious level, but the reaction he got from<br/>\nfolks who looked at his scalp and jumped to conclusions sealed<br/>\nthe fate of any such romantic/limited world view.  A corollary to<br/>\nthat is do not do anything permanent and irremediable until you<br/>\nhave a chance to step away and evaluate what you have<br/>\ninvestigated.  The first night at the pool hall is not the time<br/>\nto have a snake tattooed on your forehead.
