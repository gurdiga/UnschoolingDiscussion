Phone 323/874 3174<br/>\nFax: 323/874 3159<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nStunt people often come from martial arts. Fighting and just falling down is<br/>\nthe most common stunt work. Despite the (usually exaggerated) claims of some<br/>\nactors about doing their own stunts, most actors are too precious to be<br/>\nrisked even say falling off a chair. (Obvious exception Jackie Chan) There<br/>\nare tricks that stunt doubles learn about putting up an arm as they fall to<br/>\nhide their face, or turning so that they land looking the other way to<br/>\nfacilitate the switch back to the actor. Then there are people who<br/>\nspecialize in high falls, and there are people who specialize in driving. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome are coming from engineering or rigging backgrounds who develop the<br/>\nequipment for stunts. (see Fear Factor). Closely linked to stunt work is<br/>\nmechanical effects and pyrotechnics. These are people who like to blow stuff<br/>\nup. The person staggering about on fire is a stunt person. The link is so<br/>\nclose that many companies describe themselves as stunts and effects<br/>\ncompanies. The stunt department works closely with art department (for<br/>\nexploding windows etc) and wardrobe. Another area for stunt work is camera �<br/>\nsometimes the camera operator is doing a stunt also � going down the<br/>\nbuilding on a wire or leaping out of an airplane. Stunt people are experts<br/>\nabout safety precautions, and always examine and set up their own boxes or<br/>\nairbags.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
