Why offer assistance to an abusive parent if you don&#39;t feel<br/>\nthere&#39;s some problem with the path they are on, eg, a *better* way for them<br/>\nto be? Do you need to wait for them to ask?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is this all just a way of eliminating superior words of good/bad and<br/>\nbetter/worse and using more descriptive terminology like nurturing/hurtful<br/>\nand supportive/neglectful? I can see that. I never tell my daughter she&#39;s<br/>\ngood since that&#39;s too vague. I say things like helpful or thoughtful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet how can anyone ever intervene in a hurtful situation without making<br/>\na judgement that being loving is better than being hurtful? Can we step in<br/>\nto stop injustice without sending the message that justice is better than<br/>\ninjustice?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s the pitfall of not judging, of stopping oneself from feeling<br/>\nthis is better than that. (I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s possible to be totally<br/>\nnonjudgemental, but I&#39;m open to someone trying to explain it. *And* explain<br/>\nhow this type of viewpoint won&#39;t allow injustice to continue.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if someone is being mean to someone because they are black or<br/>\nJewish, if being nice is equal to being mean, doesn&#39;t that eliminate a<br/>\nreason to intervene?<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel I&#39;m perfectly capable of understanding that a bigot has reasons for<br/>\nbeing a bigot without stopping myself from feeling being kind is better than<br/>\nbeing mean. I&#39;m also capable of feeling my religion is better than other<br/>\nreligions without feeling that I&#39;m superior or needing to force my beliefs<br/>\non anyone of different beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand if someone finds it difficult to separate feeling what they<br/>\nhave is better from feeling others are less worthy of the oxygen they<br/>\nbreathe that eliminating good/bad could be a useful place to view the world<br/>\nfrom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I guess, I don&#39;t see judging things as better/worse as the root cause<br/>\nof a &quot;superiority complex&quot;. I think the cause comes from assuming that<br/>\nsomeone who is making different choices is lacking in knowledge or<br/>\ncompassion. I don&#39;t think the answer lies in eliminating good/bad,<br/>\nblack/white thinking, but in person with the &quot;superiority complex&quot; gaining<br/>\nknowledge about how the other person can think the way they do and<br/>\ncompassion through that knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think by eliminating the better/worse thinking, that leaves a vacuum that<br/>\npeople *could* fill with understanding and compassion. I don&#39;t know that<br/>\nit&#39;s a given, though. I think it could also be filled with distancing from<br/>\none another. Live and let live.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to participate in the Point/Counterpoint folder of AOL&#39;s<br/>\nhomeschooling board. I debated with a *lot* of fundamentalist Christians. I<br/>\ncame to understand how they believe as they do. It took a lot of work to<br/>\ngain that knowledge. And because I understood them, I could understand how<br/>\nothers also have good (to them) reasons for why they do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me the elimination of better/worse feels like someone&#39;s idea of a short<br/>\ncut past the knowledge to just accepting that everyone has good (to them)<br/>\nreasons. But I&#39;m not confident that the longer journey isn&#39;t necessary for<br/>\nmany or most people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to make as clear as possible what *I&#39;m* talking about but I&#39;m<br/>\nstill not certain that we&#39;re talking about the same thing.

I  believe you are talking about me and the Conversations with <br/>\nGod book. . . I offered it up as a possibility. Not that anyone would be more <br/>\nevolved by having that belief system or reading that book. . . just as a <br/>\npossibility some may want to consider if so inclined, just as you talk about <br/>\nbooks, ideas or whatever that inspire you. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only place you are getting this idea about &quot;not being as evolved&quot;  is <br/>\nfrom your own mind because I never put that out there. What is this about? <br/>\nYou said it was not a personal conversation, yet you continue to pick apart <br/>\nmy words and make it appear as though I am saying something I am not. <br/>\n<br/>\nI offered the information about what I believe to be true for me, what I <br/>\nbelieve in, yet you continually pick it apart and put words in my mouth and <br/>\ntry to find errors in what I am saying. If this is not personal I don&#39;t  know <br/>\nwhat is.  I love some of the things you have to say, I have told you so in <br/>\npersonal email. . . I have said so onlist when I felt so inclined. Yet, <br/>\nanytime I disagree with you, you pounce on me. Please don&#39;t insult me by <br/>\nsaying you aren&#39;t having a conversation with me. . . you are by posting my <br/>\nwords and then saying they mean something other than what I actually said. I <br/>\nreally would love to be able to come to some kind of an understanding on <br/>\nthis. . . I have no wish to bicker back and forth, being accused of things <br/>\nthat aren&#39;t true. My intent has been to explain my viewpoint and have it <br/>\nrespected as that.  I don&#39;t think that is too much to ask. . . however, when <br/>\nsomeone says I am dishonest and pretending in having my beliefs, I  sure am <br/>\ngoing to speak out about it. That is not drama. . . that is truth. <br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"dLkZ0pW8kTXsfic4CrifZT5ptY2Rq6ajq_TzFf5pmfTlCgfRnuyyyhYJpfpZVZEY59HzGu5QhEwA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"better/worse/values discussions","postDate":"1001643755","msgId":26382,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzLjFiOTdkMmIyLjI4ZTUzOGViQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26383,"prevInTime":26381,"nextInTime":26383,"topicId":26382,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" When a parent has no imagination whatsoever and no","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-466605415\">&lt;&lt; In what circumstances do you think school-at-home would be better for any<br/>\nkid than unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent has no imagination whatsoever and no willingness to take a <br/>\nchild anywhere interesting or get him any games, or when the parents says <br/>\n&quot;That is STUPID&quot; about movies, books, magazines, games, music, art that the <br/>\nchild likes.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The question wasn&#39;t directed at me, but I have seen families which couldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave unschooled, but the kid was bright enough he could have learned on his <br/>\nown in some structured fashion for the purpose of then getting OUT of that <br/>\n&quot;home.&quot;  And in such cases, I&#39;d think school might be better than the <br/>\nhomeschooling, depending on the kid.
