Like her getting her finger stuck in a whiffle ball, which wasn&#39;t really so funny then!<br/>\nShe had so many memories about her hermit crabs. I knew she loved them. She had many for years but I never realized how much she actually played with them and enjoyed them. So since we were off the next day to return our tadpole frogs to the park, why not fill the critter keeper with something else?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ended up at Petsmart and naturally I had to get a new 10 gal. tank as the critter keeper wasn&#39;t large enough to my liking. I still had wood and rocks and even shells leftover from the crabs Tara had. The kids each picked out a crab and named it. Joseph has a big one named Spike, Sierra has a medium one named Cutie and Alyssa has a wee little baby one named Brock. (not sure where that name came from!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been so involved in crabs ever since. On the internet and in books and mainly just watching them crawl around. The kids are building all kinds of homes out of Lego&#39;s, wood and foam blocks. Even going as far at to decorate them. This morning they set their alarm clocks so they could get started on a race track complete with obstacles. We spent the better part of the morning racing crabs!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first time Joseph showed interest in any critters we have had here. I would imagine we will all have wonderful crab memories to talk about when the kids are older. Thanks to Tara really.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if only I would have imagined how enthralling these critters would have been a year ago, we could have saved us the trouble of dealing with this incorrigible Beagle we have!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64987,"nextTopicId":65017}}
