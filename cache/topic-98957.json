If you just have to express your outrage, go to the event and make a<br/>\nstink!  Take a sign, try to get some protesters at the door, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  If you&#39;re primarily concerned with preventing people who are still<br/>\nopen to other parenting ideas from going down the Pearl&#39;s path... <br/>\nAttend the presentation.  When given the opportunity, ask questions that<br/>\nmake clear your objections and horror at what they&#39;re advocating.  If<br/>\nyou can find somewhere close by that you could bring a group of people, <br/>\nannounce to the audience (during one of your questions?) that you would<br/>\nlike to facilitate a discussion after the event presenting alternative<br/>\nviews for people who are being made uncomfortable by the level of<br/>\ncruelty espoused by the Pearls.  Maybe try to have a xeroxed handout<br/>\nwith some discussion (or links/references to discussion) about the<br/>\ndamage that such a parenting method can cause.  At all times try as hard<br/>\nas you can to imagine how someone might be attracted to the Pearls, and<br/>\ntry in your tone and attitude to convey that you can empathize with<br/>\ntheir goals (raising their children to be the best people they can be),<br/>\nbut cannot remain silent given your strong moral problems with the child<br/>\nabuse being advocated, and your understanding that the abuse will not<br/>\nachieve those goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to convince someone of something it&#39;s many times harder if<br/>\nthey feel completely under attack, and that you view them as evil.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot saying you have to be appeasing, or pretend that you don&#39;t find<br/>\ntheir *actions* evil.  But they have to feel that you can understand<br/>\nthem, and see their actions in the light of their best possible<br/>\nmotivations.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\n-emile</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":178116353,"authorName":"HomeSweetClass@aol.com","from":"HomeSweetClass@...","profile":"luv2hmschool2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Help!
