There seem to be<br/>\nnumerous homeschooling organizations, but I have seen<br/>\nfew, if any unschooling organizations.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer in Oregon<br/>\nWhen my kids first came out of school, and we discovered unschooling, I <br/>\nformed my own group, along with a few of the women in my (you guessed it) LLL <br/>\ngroup. It&#39;s called Unschooling Family Connection ( <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MarylandUFC/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MarylandUFC/</a> ). We strated out as 4-5 moms and the last time I checked we had <br/>\nabout 100 members.  our group has or will be getting together for Unschoolers <br/>\nNight Out (Coffee, no kids) park days, flat water tubing, Trail riding on <br/>\nhorses, pool days, tent camping, festivals, very casual kids book group, bowling, <br/>\ntreehouse camping, beach trip for a week, hiking, and we have a weeklong &quot;camp&quot; <br/>\nthat is a very relaxed, unstructured time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would say about 50% of the email list is composed of locals who are <br/>\nsomewhere on the unschooling continuum, who really use the list for Things To Do, yet <br/>\nnever show up at our events. There are probably a few who are much more <br/>\nschooly in their educational thinking, but I try to ensure when people request to <br/>\njoin that we are a support group for UNschoolers and curriculum talk, etc. is <br/>\ninappropriate. We are there to help people unschool. There are probably 40 <br/>\nlocal lists in our area (MD counties west of washington,DC) so there&#39;s plenty of <br/>\nroom for that elsewhere.<br/>\nOf the remaining 50% subbed to the list probably half again are occasional <br/>\nparticipants with the remainder being the core group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group is 4 years old. I&#39;ve recently moved further west to the eastern <br/>\npanhandle of WV and plan to start another Unschooling Family Connection here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t you start your own group? It can be done now in about 15 minutes, <br/>\nall you do is start a yahoo group, and make a packet of flyers. We put ours up <br/>\nat the health food stores, bookstores and other places like that, and we <br/>\nsearched the web for various general HS places that would put a little blurb about <br/>\nour group. I think we had one at Jon&#39;s Homeschool page, probably NHEN, too. We <br/>\nalso talked it up alot on the local HS lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Border&#39;s books and Music that we held our night out in, was very pleased <br/>\nto host us, we received lots of coffee coupons and the person in charge of <br/>\nevents went out of her way to make sure that the hsing community was considered <br/>\nduring teacher week, and other events.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been very very worth it.<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nLife&#39;s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you;<br/>\nThey&#39;re supposed to help you discover who you are. <br/>\n~Bernice Johnson Reagon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98957,"nextTopicId":99000}}
