That was her process. Then she finally knew<br/>\n&gt; that the<br/>\n&gt; flute was &#39;home&#39; for her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Second, you are paying. Don&#39;t be afraid to say &lt;this teacher isn&#39;t for<br/>\n&gt; me&gt;, and<br/>\n&gt; seek out a new one. My friend has done this several times.

In my experience (which<br/>\n&gt; is considerable) the key issues, in order, are the right instrument,<br/>\n&gt; and the right teacher.  There was an extraordinary study done in<br/>\n&gt; Northern England some years back (which is now published as &quot;The Right<br/>\n&gt; Instrument for Your Child&quot;) in which children who continued on with<br/>\n&gt; their music education right up to and including conservatories were<br/>\n&gt; compared with those who quit.  There was no evidence that the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;musicians&quot; were any more innately musical than those who quit.  The<br/>\n&gt; single most important factor was finding the instrument which<br/>\n&gt; maximized the temperament and physical and emotional proclivities of<br/>\n&gt; the child.  I imagine that is true for adults too, it has been in my<br/>\n&gt; experience (I went through much of my life musically unfulfilled,<br/>\n&gt; although very musical, until I could find the instrument.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a small section of my forthcoming homeschooling book &quot;And the<br/>\nSkylark Sings with Me&quot; on &quot;Choosing a Music Teacher&quot;.
