I come here because I need <br/>\nideas, help, inspiration.  But my life is my home, my family, our farm, art, <br/>\nmusic.  That&#39;s where I get my &quot;self worth&quot; and good feelings about myself.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t look to a group of people I&#39;ve never met (IRL) to fulfil my self esteem <br/>\nand to make me feel included.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just happens that if you post, banter back and forth, joke, and share <br/>\nwithout taking anything personally, your self worth and good feelings WILL grow.  <br/>\nHow can they not, when you&#39;re learning to relax, trust, and be a kinder and <br/>\ngentler parent?  Then you won&#39;t feel like an outsider because you &quot;get&quot; what the <br/>\nlong-timers so passionately have &quot;gotten&quot; for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78473,"nextTopicId":78512}}
