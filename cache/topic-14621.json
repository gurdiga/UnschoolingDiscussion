I&#39;ve gotten lots of support and ideas for<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; from this list.  I&#39;ve yet to meet a list that is RIGIDLY<br/>\non-topic.  Unschooling does encompass a wide variety of ideas.  After<br/>\nall, unschooling is what our children do when they don&#39;t attend school. <br/>\nWe each need to do what is best for our own family and can&#39;t expect that<br/>\neverything we read anywhere will fit our needs.  So give the list another<br/>\nweek or two before you decide if it&#39;s for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince breastfeeding is the biologically determined method of human (we<br/>\nare mammals) feeding, I find it ridiculous that a child of any age would<br/>\nneed a bottle.  I also realize that many in our society tend to see<br/>\nbottle feeding as the norm, so too many women and children have not been<br/>\nable to breastfeed due to a lack of support and accurate information.  I<br/>\ndo respect any parent who has done the research and made an informed<br/>\ndecision that not breastfeeding is best for their own child.  And I feel<br/>\nsad for those who were unable to breastfeed when they truly wanted to. <br/>\nWe can only try to do our best and continue on when life does not turn<br/>\nout the way we plan.  Many of us on this list have already stepped out of<br/>\nbounds of &quot;normal&quot;.  How can we be so bold as to think that our children<br/>\nwill become successful adults without 12 years of being taught everything<br/>\nthat someone else has decided is important?   Yet, I depend on the<br/>\nsupport I get from this list to help me trust my children to learn what<br/>\nthey will need to have a good life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nWe just pretended to be ourselves<br/>\nriding on the train.<br/>\n&quot;How Children Learn&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14609,"nextTopicId":14626}}
