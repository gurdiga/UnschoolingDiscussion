After I <br/>\ngot a grip on myself (after posting, emailing, crying, etc.), amazing <br/>\nthings started to happen!  My two oldest actually finished their <br/>\nhumongous task of cleaning their playroom!!  Then we started on their <br/>\nreligious ed homework and (this is amazing because it is so rare) my <br/>\nson actually read two whole chapters to me!!<br/>\n<br/>\nA while ago we embrassed the idea that he would learn to read on his <br/>\nown.  It was very, very scary at first, what give up CONTROL?, but <br/>\nthen we have moments such as this afternoon when I know the Lord is <br/>\ngiving me a break and a sign and my son is showing me that he can <br/>\nread and he comprehends what he is reading!  I think he learned <br/>\nsomething else today, too.  Mom&#39;s not so bad to read to!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks and praise the Lord for showing me the way again!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13467,"nextTopicId":13451}}
