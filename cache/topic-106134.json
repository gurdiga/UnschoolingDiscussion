I had clinical deppression off & on for years.<br/>\n I read a book called The Psychology of Nothingness by<br/>\nWilliam J. Kraft. this is a great book, don&#39;t know if<br/>\nit is still in print, but it is all about these<br/>\ntransitional phases of feelings of &quot;nothingness&quot; all<br/>\npeople go through. Also read The Courage to Be and<br/>\nother existential psychology.<br/>\n(so I got an M.A. in Psych age 26 no clue whatsoever<br/>\nwhat to do next as my university prof dad had prepared<br/>\nme to be a professional student with no clue about the<br/>\nreal world, so I became a stripper wherein I learned<br/>\neverything I did not learn in public school. from that<br/>\nworld I became a single mom and hence an unschooler on<br/>\nthis list. Buddhism has a concept called the theory of<br/>\ndependent origination: from one set of circumstances<br/>\nanother arises, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShort Version: The more you embrace the feelings of<br/>\nnothingness and despair the more quickly you move<br/>\nthrough them to the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy still deschooling 12 year old boy still expresses<br/>\nsome of this stuff. Right now he spends most of his<br/>\ntime in fantasy game chat rooms. I read his posts and<br/>\nsay something good about them. They ARE very creative.<br/>\nwhen he tells me he is worthless, etc., I tell him I<br/>\nknow how he feels, (THIS EMPATHY IS CRUCIAL, otherwise<br/>\nhe just tunes me out) but i also contradict him, and<br/>\ntell him he is not worthless. then I suggest a bike<br/>\nride or something physical outdoors for us to do<br/>\ntogether. if he says no at first, I keep at him till<br/>\nhe agrees. He ALWAYS cheers up after some outdoor<br/>\nexercise with Mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Of course, I am preparing him 6 years in advance for<br/>\nthe reality that I will not be able to continue to<br/>\nsupport him completely after the age of 18.
