The first month we did a unit study and had a blast. The <br/>\nsecond month we did  a unit study that wasn&#39;t quite so cool, although it <br/>\nhad some cool aspects and we certainly were FAR from miserable. After <br/>\nthat we unschooled, but I made no big announcement. We just got busy <br/>\nwith doing fun things together. That was their &quot;schooling&quot; as far as I <br/>\nwas concerned, even though it had no resemblance to conventional <br/>\nschooling. I had no problem at all considering the real-life fun <br/>\nindividual-child-centered life we were living as a perfectly legitimate <br/>\nway to homeschool.  We had no big discussion about it. I WAS still <br/>\nhomeschooling them in the way I knew was by far the most supportive of <br/>\nthem receiving an outstanding &quot;education&quot; tailored just for them <br/>\n(largely BY them, how could it not be individualized? &lt;g&gt;). I kept a <br/>\nnotebook in which I jotted down what we were doing and I would sometimes <br/>\nput those things into educationeze. When my husband wanted to talk about <br/>\nwhat the children were doing for school, I&#39;d pull that out and talk <br/>\nabout what we&#39;d done. I wish I had those records -but we had a fire in <br/>\nour house and that notebook was destroyed. I only did it for a few <br/>\nmonths, but it was enough for my husband to slowly grasp that we weren&#39;t <br/>\ndoing &quot;reading lessons&quot; but we were very much supporting our kids&#39; <br/>\ndeveloping interest and competency in the skills that would lead to <br/>\nreading. We weren&#39;t doing &quot;science&quot; but we were doing a HUGE amount of <br/>\nscience.

Actually we have no routine, we do less days of school work than we do schoolwork.  But he is noticing since he&#39;s retired and home all day.

He did not get that from doing schoolwork. <br/>\nAs to divorce, I dare not since I would probably have to find a job, work all day and send my son to school.  That is not something I want for me or my son.   We will find our way into it and my hubby will, hopefully, start enjoying our son as well.  I am positive that it will work out once he sees that I am happier and so is my son.

If he&#39;s comfortable with  <br/>\nunschooling, that&#39;s fine, but I never talked to my kids much about  <br/>\nunschooling at all--I just found cool things to do when they were  <br/>\nbabies and continued to do so until... well I still do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou and your son could mine the school materials for good parts,  <br/>\nmaybe, and if you can&#39;t find any good parts that will give you both  <br/>\nconfidence.  If you DO find good parts, that can indicate what other  <br/>\nkinds of things you might want to move toward.  If he likes grammar,  <br/>\nthere are LOTS of humorous books on the history of English--trivia  <br/>\nbooks with short passages on words and phrases that will tie into  <br/>\nhistory and geography and explorations.
