We don&#39;t use it on the whole garden<br/>\n, just where we don&#39;t want the snails, for any food, or things the kids have<br/>\ngrown , or things we are growing from seed, until they get big enough to<br/>\nsurvive mising a few leaves, and on my lovely new hosta :-) Other snails get<br/>\nmarked with nail varnish and are tracked.  Our garden is not that big, being<br/>\nan English terraced garden, but it is packed ful of plants. And soon we will<br/>\nbe trying to find more space (we have started on containers)  for whatever<br/>\nwe want to try out in the spring.

They can devoure over<br/>\nnight young plants. I grew up in Kansas and I never<br/>\nnoticed slugs (never remember seeing any snails)<br/>\nhaving any major damage to plants. It could have<br/>\nsomething to do with they just don&#39;t multiply like<br/>\nthey can here in rain land. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I want to garden to have food for my family or<br/>\njust a little beauty I would rather kill a few snails<br/>\nthen poison the snails and hence the earth and my<br/>\ngarden.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also argue that it impossible never to kill<br/>\neven if someone is a vegetarian/vegan. If you plant a<br/>\ngarden you are removing something that lived there<br/>\nbefore maybe it was &quot;just&quot; grass but maybe it was some<br/>\nnative plants too. Maybe some insects live there maybe<br/>\nsome slugs. Death is a part of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping that in mind I do not practice all out animal<br/>\ngenocide when attempting to garden. I kept the snail<br/>\npopulation in check. I am thankful and mindful when I<br/>\nam in my snail removal as well as when I garden. I<br/>\nfeel just as thankful for the food aninimal and<br/>\nvegetable that offers its life so I may live.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
