Within an eruv, observers may do physical<br/>\nactivities on the Sabbath such as pushing a wheelchair or stroller, that are<br/>\nnot typically allowed.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe Sabbath is a day of rest, where no physical activities are undertaken. <br/>\nThis includes turning on light switches, stoves, and using appliances,<br/>\nvehicles, and items that make life &quot;easy&quot;.  In some communities, non-Jewish<br/>\nteens are hired out to do these activities for observant families each<br/>\nFriday sunset to Saturday sunset.  Other observant families just keep a pot<br/>\nof stew or soup going on &quot;low&quot; for 24 hours, and leave a light on during the<br/>\nsunset to sunset period.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMost people &quot;miss&quot; eruv markings because they blend in so well with poles,<br/>\nwires and all the other wayward &quot;stuff&quot; like shoes.  But, for Jews, new to<br/>\nan area, the markings can be viewed as friendly areas to settle into or<br/>\nvisit.  For the Orthodox Jew, the wires and plastic specifically designate<br/>\ncommunities that support their faith based lifestyle.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHere is a link to a map of the LA Community Eruv:\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.laeruv.com/eruvborders.gif\">http://www.laeruv.com/eruvborders.gif</a>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnd here is a link to pictures of eruv markings:\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.laeruv.com/adapter.htm\">http://www.laeruv.com/adapter.htm</a>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor anyone interested, you can Google in almost every major city name and <br/>\nthe word eruv and get information on a map of the eruv boundaries.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDiane<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96454,"nextTopicId":96457}}
