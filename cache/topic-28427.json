I am now mastering the art of retiring at a young age after a 20 year career in the Air Force and five years of military school. I spend my days as a full time stay at home dad, snowboarder, mountain biker, hiker, baker, swimmer and an untalented but very enthusiastic guitar player and drummer. I am one year into fixing up our 100 year old home and building a shelter in the Rocky Mountains (I have now added and subtracted fractions). I have finally figured out that I really don&#39;t know much and I&#39;m happier this way.<br/>\nSteve will host:<br/>\n  Beyond Harvard and Goat Farming: Real Life<br/>\n  This will be an open discussion group exploring these two questions. Is getting our children into college our measure of success for our children and ourselves as parents? What does a day in the life of an unschooler look like?<br/>\n  Dad&#39;s Panel<br/>\n  Fathers sometimes have unique views on unschooling. This is an opportunity to ask a panel of experience unschooling Dads their views, opinions and insights on unschooling. Recommended for Moms and Dads!<br/>\n  Dad&#39;s Only Discussion Group: Tough Issues<br/>\n  This open-ended session can continue all weekend if we want it to. There will interest, time and space to discuss such topics as loss of community, isolation, making sense of the rat race, all issues related to unschooling, parenting, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n                    JOIN US!<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Join hundreds of unschooling families from around the globe as we rethink the meanings of education, learning and parenting. Rethinking Education supports attachment parenting, unconditional love, support for each person&#39;s unique journey of life experience, freedom with responsibility, unschooling and you. YOU are the vital ingredient at this conference, as we come together and revel in the magic and mystery of kindred spirits and each other&#39;s rich diversity, as we challenge ourselves to trust the extraordinary process of living and learning, the wondrous ability to improve the ways we communicate, discovering new ways of listening to one another, giving full support to our dreams, no matter how wild or ordinary, large or small.<br/>\n  Unschooling is vital to the profoundly intelligent development of our children. And yes, as adults we can even unschool ourselves... as you will discover.<br/>\n<br/>\n                    <br/>\n   Let us put our minds together and see what we will make for our children.<br/>\n  Chief Sitting Bull<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nWe&#39;re Looking for a Few Great Mentors<br/>\n  We are receiving lots of requests for unschool mentoring!

She loved the articles about all animals but poured over the ones about Jane Goodall till they were thin. Everyone told her she couldn&#39;t study chimpanzees in Africa and unfortunately she believed them. She went to college in 1980 and loved every minute of it, except for the boring parts like memorizing the Krebs Cycle over and over again and learning organic chemistry equations which she never once used and oh yea that pesky calculus. Well, she survived 4 years at the University of Iowa, worked, but kept dreaming of Africa. 6 years later she went to grad school for more punishment and studied contaminated soils in up state New York. In 1991 she graduated and married a fabulous guy who convinced her, &quot;It is better to try and fail then never to try at all.&quot; So one day she decided she would write someone about volunteering her time to<br/>\n do field work in Madagascar with lemurs. They weren&#39;t chimpanzees but it was a start. They said yes! After returning she decided to ask about studying chimpanzees. The answer was yes!! But, she had to pay her own expenses. Who would give her money to do what she had wanted to do her whole life? Her husband Keith suggested she apply for a Fulbright and helped her navigate through the lengthy application process. They said yes. In 1998 her dream was actualized as she journeyed to the Budongo Forest in Uganda to study wild chimpanzee behavior. In 1999 she began studying her own human primates. She says there are many similarities between humans and chimpanzees and in the near future plans to take her children Abigail & Bryce to Africa to live among our closest relatives. The take home message is, if you want your children to dream, leave interesting magazines lying about and teach your children to ask for what they want as, often times, people do say yes. Paula will host:<br/>\n  The View from the Oak: How Animals See the World<br/>\n  Have you ever wondered how bees, snakes, spiders, whales or other non-human creatures see the world, or see us? Through the imaginary eyes of such creatures, Paula will reveal things about our environment that are no less fantastic than science fiction stories about life on other planets.<br/>\n  Medical Heretic: Radiant Life Off the Medical Grid<br/>\n  Rarely, if ever, does a person need the help of traditional medicine, or allopathy, to achieve healing or wellness. In fact, much of allopathic medicine is counterproductive, even dangerous to well being. Learn why why you might choose to avoid vaccines and pharmaceuticals and how alternative approaches to health care such as homeopathy and medicinal herbs are not only safer but produce superior results.<br/>\n<br/>\n        <br/>\n                      Our conference is provoking, outrageous, inspiring and mind-blowing... for the whole family. Grandparents attend free! Speakers include: <br/>\n  John Taylor Gatto, Ren Allen, Peter Kowalke, Tracy Liebmann, Michael Mendizza, Cindy Gaddis, Eli Gerzon, Debbie Shapiro ... so many more! <br/>\n  Our wildly popular kid and teen activities include: <br/>\n  Kid Village, Teen & Tween Village, non-stop, out-of-the-box art, unprom, yoga, dance, gobs of extraordinary sessions.... <br/>\n  Wait!
