I don&#39;t want to stifle a <br/>\n&gt; trait that could be an asset in adulthood under the proper circumstances. <br/>\n&gt; She <br/>\n&gt; would make a great lawyer. But it makes for a very tense situation when she <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; would rather argue something into the ground and become belligerent and <br/>\n&gt; disrespectful over something trivial to me. So I guess I can learn to argue <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; with her(not against her) in a productive way, and try to model to her the <br/>\n&gt; respectful way to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can learn to keep your cool, not get exasperated, be able to move her on <br/>\nto something else smoothly, etc. You can, for example, ask very directly <br/>\nsometimes, &quot;Is this worth us spending our time arguing about or do you think <br/>\nit would be better to get going and go get our ice cream now?&quot; &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr sometimes you can STOP arguing by making nonargumentative comments, <br/>\nwithout really conceding: &quot;You know - you do make a good point.&quot; Then just <br/>\nmove on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve experimented with a lot of things -- but if you&#39;re <br/>\nstill ending up tense and exasperated (as opposed to having perspective <br/>\nenough even at the time to grin and think, to yourself, &quot;whew - one <br/>\npersistent kid&quot;) then maybe people here can brainstorm a lot of different <br/>\nways to handle a very argumentative kids (my middle daughter has been known <br/>\nto be like that, too, during different stages in her life).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - like you said, she may be wanting your focussed attention more than <br/>\nanything else. Arguing is really GOOD for getting that. Some kids don&#39;t seem <br/>\nto ever be able to get enough - that can be SO hard on moms and sometimes you <br/>\nhave to be okay with knowing that you ARE giving a reasonable amount of <br/>\ndirect attention - even if the child doesn&#39;t seem to think she&#39;s getting <br/>\nenough. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - arguing is GOOD for developing thinking ability. I once asked David <br/>\nColfax how he&#39;d describe what their kids&#39; learning was like - or some other <br/>\nlame question &lt;G&gt; - and he said that it was at dinner-table arguments that <br/>\nthe kids really learned to think. But you have to get her to argue bigger <br/>\nmore significant principles - not little petty trivial stuff that drives you <br/>\nnuts. So - maybe start asking her - &quot;What do you think about .......?&quot;  Ask <br/>\nthings that might seem beyond her years -- let her take a stand that you <br/>\ndon&#39;t agree with. Don&#39;t just beat her at arguing either - give her a lot of <br/>\nrespect for coming up with good arguments even if you don&#39;t agree with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t you keep track, for a day or two, about what things she&#39;s <br/>\nargumentative about?
