My kids found it hard to follow. There is a series of tapes that you listen to while looking at drawings in an accompanying book.<br/>\n A friend of ours who is a native Peruvian likes it because the learner learns the language just like we learned our native language--by listening.

My 9 yo dd is also interested in ASL and has been teaching herself from a couple of books, The Joy of Signing and American Sign Language Dictionary. She likes the Joy og Signing better. We are looking for an instructor, though.<br/>\n Debra (in Ohio)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24056,"nextTopicId":24059}}
