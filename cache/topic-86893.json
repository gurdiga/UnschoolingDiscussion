Why does <br/>\nshe want their toys so badly?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome thoughts to get your thinking going.  Could it be that she still <br/>\nlikes to play with &quot;younger&quot; toys and they have better &quot;little kid&quot; <br/>\ntoys than she does?  I know that while my daughter is getting older <br/>\nand liking &quot;older kid&quot; stuff, she also has days when she sits and <br/>\nplays with &quot;little kid&quot; stuff as though she were still 5. It&#39;s sweet <br/>\nactually. :)  Maybe if you get to yard sales or thrift shops and let <br/>\nher buy whatever she wants, she&#39;ll pick out some &quot;baby stuff&quot; of her <br/>\nown. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAre most of your toys individual toys?  My kids have stuff that <br/>\nbelongs to them individually of course.  But a lot of our toys are <br/>\ntoys that belong to the whole family.  Matt got a t-wrecks hotwheel <br/>\nset for Christmas and Luke got the ice mountain hothweels set, but <br/>\nthe general understanding with those types of gifts is that just <br/>\nbecause Matt got to open the t-wrecks and Luke got to open the ice <br/>\nmountain doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not really the whole family&#39;s <br/>\ntoys.  So anyone can play with anything anytime and they aren&#39;t kept <br/>\nin bedrooms, they&#39;re kept in the playroom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] sneakiness","postDate":"1072504045","msgId":86895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGJzaW0wMytucHY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":86893,"nextInTopic":86900,"prevInTime":86894,"nextInTime":86896,"topicId":86893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1317058544\">&lt;&lt;says he DOES care.
