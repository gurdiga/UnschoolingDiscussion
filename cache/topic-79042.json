So I can make <br/>\nthose, <br/>\nhey everyone..i just had to add my 2 cents..i have been told i was a good cook, but i struggled for years with biscuits, my husband (who cant cook) made better biscuits than me! well.. i discovered that buttermilk makes the difference! and if u dont have buttermilk, u can make your own..with a tablespoon of lemon juice added to a cup of milk (roughly, it doesnt have to be exact)..and i also discovered that for pie crusts...if they look really bad, then they taste good! dont understand what that&#39;s about..maybe just not handling them too much.. well happy biscuit making! cya, marybeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
