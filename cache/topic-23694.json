The man is very, very short and can only reach halfway up the elevator<br/>\n  buttons. However, if it is raining then he will have his umbrella with him<br/>\n  and can press the higher buttons with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  2. The surgeon was his mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n  3. It was day time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  4. At the time she went into labor, the mother of the twins was traveling<br/>\n  by boat. The older twin, Terry, was born first early on March 1st. The<br/>\nboat<br/>\n  then crossed a time zone and Kerry, the younger twin, was born on February<br/>\n  the 28th. Therefore, the younger twin celebrates her birthday two days<br/>\n  before her older brother.<br/>\n<br/>\n  5. A square manhole cover can be turned and dropped down the diagonal of<br/>\n  the manhole. A round manhole cannot be dropped down the manhole. So for<br/>\n  safety and practicality, all manhole covers should be round.<br/>\n<br/>\n  6. The poison in the punch came from the ice cubes. When the man drank the<br/>\n  punch, the ice was fully frozen. Gradually it melted, poisoning the punch.<br/>\n<br/>\n  7. He recognized Adam and Eve as the only people without navels. Because<br/>\n  they were not born of women, they had never had umbilical cords and<br/>\n  therefore they never had navels. This one seems perfectly logical but it<br/>\n  can sometimes spark fierce theological arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\n  8. They were two of a set of triplets (or quadruplets, etc.). This puzzle<br/>\n  stumps many people. They try outlandish solutions involving test-tube<br/>\n  babies or surrogate mothers. Why does the brain search for complex<br/>\n  solutions when there is a much simpler one available?<br/>\n<br/>\n  9. The man had hiccups. The barman recognized this from his speech and<br/>\ndrew   the gun in order to give him a shock. It worked and cured the<br/>\nhiccups-so the man no longer needed the water.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23613,"nextTopicId":23699}}
