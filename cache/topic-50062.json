The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child<br/>\nbe<br/>\nwho she is and blossom into who she will become. Education happens as a<br/>\nside<br/>\neffect.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as people plant vegetable gardens to raise vegetables. Along the<br/>\nway<br/>\npollinators come and it&#39;s even a vital part of the process, but the<br/>\npurpose<br/>\nof planting the garden isn&#39;t to attract pollinators.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the other homeschooling methods is to give to the child<br/>\nsomething that appeals to the parents. In a way formal educational<br/>\nmethods<br/>\nare like those cool educational toys that parents want to give their<br/>\nkids<br/>\nfor their birthday. What you&#39;re buying with a curriculum is an image of<br/>\nwhat<br/>\nyou want your child to be. The image may be as simple as being prepared<br/>\nto<br/>\nbe whatever they want to be. And yet it is still like picturing your<br/>\nchild<br/>\nplaying with the super deluxe Erector set you&#39;re planning to give them.<br/>\nBut<br/>\nwhat if the child has no interest in Erector sets? What if what the<br/>\nchild<br/>\nreally wants is a Nintendo system?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many parents see education as a gift they can give their<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if the recipent doesn&#39;t want the gift? If the purpose of giving<br/>\na<br/>\ngift is to satisfy some need in the giver for the recipient to have the<br/>\ngift, is it really a gift? If the gift giver has emotional stake in the<br/>\nrecipent appreciating the gift and the effort involved in providing the<br/>\ngift, is it really a gift?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be helpful for parents choosing formal education to see<br/>\nit<br/>\nhonestly. Despite the pictures of happy children using the various<br/>\nformal<br/>\ncurriculums, it&#39;s not about giving a gift. It&#39;s about meeting *parents&#39;*<br/>\nneeds. It&#39;s about molding and shaping a fellow human being against their<br/>\nwill into something we want them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds harsh, but if it weren&#39;t against their will, then the<br/>\nchildren<br/>\nwould choose to do it on their own. If it weren&#39;t against their will,<br/>\nthere<br/>\nwould never be instances where the parent is coercing the child to do<br/>\nsomething for the curriculum that the child doesn&#39;t want to do. There<br/>\nwould<br/>\nnever be instances where the child can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t want to finish<br/>\nthat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about giving them the freedom to be who they are. Formal<br/>\neducation is about molding them into something we think is valuable to<br/>\nbe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The thing is my DS LOVES structure. He<br/>\n&gt; likes to know what is happening next, and what is expected of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean it must be unstructured. The days can be as<br/>\nstructured as your family needs them to be. What isn&#39;t structured,<br/>\nthough,<br/>\nis learning. If your family has a lot of activites, you can structure<br/>\nhome<br/>\ntime into the week. But it wouldn&#39;t be unschooling to set aside a<br/>\nspecific<br/>\ntime for them to do math or workbooks. If *a particular child* would<br/>\nlike to<br/>\nset up their own schedule to do that, then it&#39;s fine to help him set it<br/>\nup<br/>\nand help him adjust it to meet whatever goal he&#39;s trying to meet, but<br/>\nthe<br/>\nschedule is his, not the parent&#39;s to enforce.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes when I&#39;m making dinner I&#39;ll get out dough to play with, or<br/>\n&gt; paper and crayons, and he asks me what I want him to make. I tell him<br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; make whatever he wants. Right now he&#39;s in a preschool program, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pretty structured and he loves it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think if everyone had independent creator in them, there would be no<br/>\npicture book illustrators, or product designers, or wallpaper designers,<br/>\nor<br/>\narchitects, or programmers, or ...<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing anything you want can be overwhelming. Working around natural<br/>\nlimitations, meeting some predefined goal in your own way can be<br/>\nchallenging<br/>\nand inspiring. So when he asks, think of yourself as the picture book<br/>\nwriter<br/>\nand him as the illustrator and give him a spark to run with. If you&#39;re<br/>\nnot<br/>\ngood at thinking up things spontaneously, brainstorm a wild list of<br/>\nthings<br/>\nand keep it in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m a bit uncomfortable with no structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who is the homeschooling for? Them or you? Whose needs is homeschooling<br/>\nsupposed to meet?

But I am not<br/>\n&gt; sure I have it in me to totally let them do whatever they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because you&#39;re unclear on what your goals are. And you&#39;re intertwining<br/>\nyour<br/>\nneeds and agendas with their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it still unschooling if you include typical school activities,<br/>\n&gt; textbooks, workbooks etc if that is what the child wants to do?

For a while it was<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; numbers pages, but now he is doing the alphabet pages.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the child has full freedom to choose to do it or not, choose to do it<br/>\nin<br/>\nwhatever manner they want, then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think I&#39;d also be aware that I might be getting satisfaction out<br/>\nof<br/>\nseeing the workbooks being done and make sure I was being as attentive<br/>\nin<br/>\nmeeting their other needs. For instance I&#39;d want to be aware that I was<br/>\nputting a high priority on replacing finished workbooks, but was setting<br/>\na<br/>\nlow priority on things I saw as less important like making the trip<br/>\nacross<br/>\ntown so they can buy the video game they&#39;ve been saving for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So if I pull<br/>\n&gt; together a unit study when he shows an interest and lead the learning<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this still unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the child can say &quot;No thanks, I&#39;d rather go watch TV&quot; and you be<br/>\nperfectly okay with that then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; During my research I&#39;ve discovered Reggio Emilia, an Italian method of<br/>\n&gt; early childhood education. Here&#39;s a link that I found interesting.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; sounds very unschooling to me...but would it still be considered<br/>\n&gt; unschooling if you sent your children to a school?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re uncomfortable with unschooling but want to stretch<br/>\nthe<br/>\ndefinition of unschooling to encompass your comfort zone. What is it<br/>\nabout<br/>\nunschooling that you want? Ask yourself why you want to be able to call<br/>\nthis<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling *will* make you uncomfortable. You can&#39;t have the benefits<br/>\nof<br/>\nchild chosen learning without letting go of control.

The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be<br/>\nwho she is and blossom into who she will become. Education happens as a side<br/>\neffect.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as people plant vegetable gardens to raise vegetables. Along the way<br/>\npollinators come and it&#39;s even a vital part of the process, but the purpose<br/>\nof planting the garden isn&#39;t to attract pollinators.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the other homeschooling methods is to give to the child<br/>\nsomething that appeals to the parents. In a way formal educational methods<br/>\nare like those cool educational toys that parents want to give their kids<br/>\nfor their birthday. What you&#39;re buying with a curriculum is an image of what<br/>\nyou want your child to be. The image may be as simple as being prepared to<br/>\nbe whatever they want to be. And yet it is still like picturing your child<br/>\nplaying with the super deluxe Erector set you&#39;re planning to give them. But<br/>\nwhat if the child has no interest in Erector sets? What if what the child<br/>\nreally wants is a Nintendo system?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many parents see education as a gift they can give their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if the recipent doesn&#39;t want the gift? If the purpose of giving a<br/>\ngift is to satisfy some need in the giver for the recipient to have the<br/>\ngift, is it really a gift? If the gift giver has emotional stake in the<br/>\nrecipent appreciating the gift and the effort involved in providing the<br/>\ngift, is it really a gift?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be helpful for parents choosing formal education to see it<br/>\nhonestly. Despite the pictures of happy children using the various formal<br/>\ncurriculums, it&#39;s not about giving a gift. It&#39;s about meeting *parents&#39;*<br/>\nneeds. It&#39;s about molding and shaping a fellow human being against their<br/>\nwill into something we want them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds harsh, but if it weren&#39;t against their will, then the children<br/>\nwould choose to do it on their own. If it weren&#39;t against their will, there<br/>\nwould never be instances where the parent is coercing the child to do<br/>\nsomething for the curriculum that the child doesn&#39;t want to do. There would<br/>\nnever be instances where the child can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t want to finish that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about giving them the freedom to be who they are. Formal<br/>\neducation is about molding them into something we think is valuable to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The thing is my DS LOVES structure. He<br/>\n&gt; likes to know what is happening next, and what is expected of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean it must be unstructured. The days can be as<br/>\nstructured as your family needs them to be. What isn&#39;t structured, though,<br/>\nis learning. If your family has a lot of activites, you can structure home<br/>\ntime into the week. But it wouldn&#39;t be unschooling to set aside a specific<br/>\ntime for them to do math or workbooks. If *a particular child* would like to<br/>\nset up their own schedule to do that, then it&#39;s fine to help him set it up<br/>\nand help him adjust it to meet whatever goal he&#39;s trying to meet, but the<br/>\nschedule is his, not the parent&#39;s to enforce.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes when I&#39;m making dinner I&#39;ll get out dough to play with, or<br/>\n&gt; paper and crayons, and he asks me what I want him to make.

Right now he&#39;s in a preschool program, it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pretty structured and he loves it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think if everyone had independent creator in them, there would be no<br/>\npicture book illustrators, or product designers, or wallpaper designers, or<br/>\narchitects, or programmers, or ...<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing anything you want can be overwhelming. Working around natural<br/>\nlimitations, meeting some predefined goal in your own way can be challenging<br/>\nand inspiring. So when he asks, think of yourself as the picture book writer<br/>\nand him as the illustrator and give him a spark to run with.

And you&#39;re intertwining your<br/>\nneeds and agendas with their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it still unschooling if you include typical school activities,<br/>\n&gt; textbooks, workbooks etc if that is what the child wants to do?

For a while it was the<br/>\n&gt; numbers pages, but now he is doing the alphabet pages.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the child has full freedom to choose to do it or not, choose to do it in<br/>\nwhatever manner they want, then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think I&#39;d also be aware that I might be getting satisfaction out of<br/>\nseeing the workbooks being done and make sure I was being as attentive in<br/>\nmeeting their other needs. For instance I&#39;d want to be aware that I was<br/>\nputting a high priority on replacing finished workbooks, but was setting a<br/>\nlow priority on things I saw as less important like making the trip across<br/>\ntown so they can buy the video game they&#39;ve been saving for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So if I pull<br/>\n&gt; together a unit study when he shows an interest and lead the learning is<br/>\n&gt; this still unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the child can say &quot;No thanks, I&#39;d rather go watch TV&quot; and you be<br/>\nperfectly okay with that then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; During my research I&#39;ve discovered Reggio Emilia, an Italian method of<br/>\n&gt; early childhood education.

When I first heard of unschooling (a<br/>\nfew years ago) I thought it was way out there and completely dismissed<br/>\nit as too &quot;hippie-ish&quot;. I knew (and still know) that I want to<br/>\nhomeschool. My children are too precious to subject to the public school<br/>\nsystem, and for the most part I think private schools are even worse. My<br/>\noldest DS will be ready for kindergarten next school year, but here in<br/>\nIL children don&#39;t officially have to be in school until 7, so<br/>\ntechnically I have a few years before I have to make any &quot;real&quot;<br/>\ndecisions. I&#39;ve been researching all the different Homeschooling<br/>\nmethods...and I must admit that they all appeal to me in different ways.<br/>\nClassical education makes lots of sense but sounds too structured to me.<br/>\nAlthough to me it does make sense to study Latin as it is the basis for<br/>\na lot languages and it would (probably) make learning a foreign language<br/>\neasier. Unit studies sounds like lots of fun, not as structured as the<br/>\nclassical approach. I&#39;m leaning toward unit studies. Using a cirruculum<br/>\nsounds like lots of work to me, and maybe too structured, but I think I<br/>\ncould make it as loose as I want. The thing is my DS LOVES structure. He<br/>\nlikes to know what is happening next, and what is expected of him.<br/>\nSometimes when I&#39;m making dinner I&#39;ll get out dough to play with, or<br/>\npaper and crayons, and he asks me what I want him to make. I tell him to<br/>\nmake whatever he wants. Right now he&#39;s in a preschool program, it&#39;s<br/>\npretty structured and he loves it. Unschooling I think would be hard for<br/>\nhim, and honestly, I&#39;m a bit uncomfortable with no structure. I could<br/>\nbuy one of those $20 workbook types of curriculums so I have an idea of<br/>\nwhat topics to introduce. I still have some time for research. I totally<br/>\nbuy into the philosophy of child lead learning. I don&#39;t want to force my<br/>\nchildren to learn anything that does not interest them. But I am not<br/>\nsure I have it in me to totally let them do whatever they want. My<br/>\noldest is so eager to learn to read...I&#39;m looking into phonics programs<br/>\nfor him. But for now we are playing with fridge alphabet magnets and<br/>\nlearning the different sound combinations. He surprised me and put<br/>\ntogether the word &quot;BED&quot; all by himself. He really wants to learn to<br/>\nread, now I have to figure out how best to teach him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now for my questions...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it still unschooling if you include typical school activities,<br/>\ntextbooks, workbooks etc if that is what the child wants to do? My<br/>\noldest loves workbooks. He does not do them in order; he will flip<br/>\nthrough them and do the pages that interest him. For a while it was the<br/>\nnumbers pages, but now he is doing the alphabet pages. So if I pull<br/>\ntogether a unit study when he shows an interest and lead the learning is<br/>\nthis still unschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring my research I&#39;ve discovered Reggio Emilia, an Italian method of<br/>\nearly childhood education.

I have not really tried to sell<br/>\nunschooling because I am on the fence myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx for reading, and for the most part I&#39;ve enjoyed this list.<br/>\nSherry - Mom to two beautiful boys (4 1/2 y.o. and 2 y.o.)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"My 5 year old wants to make his own computer game","postDate":"1037637134","msgId":50062,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFyYjRtZSt1MzJvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50082,"prevInTime":50061,"nextInTime":50063,"topicId":50062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m hoping someone on the list can help me in some way!

My 5 year <br/>\nold has been playing Freddi the Fish a lot, the one where you can <br/>\nmake your own mazes.  He thinks it is so cool, and was talking to his <br/>\nsister (9) about how cool it would be if you could make your own <br/>\ncomputer games to do whatever you wanted.  He asked dh and I if he <br/>\ncould, and dh said he would look into it.  Neither of us already know <br/>\nhow to make our own computer games.  Dh knows more about computers <br/>\nthan I do, but he&#39;s afraid it could take months to learn what he <br/>\nneeds to learn to teach my son how to do it and by then my son might <br/>\nbe really frustrated.  Already he&#39;s asking me to write notes, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>\nforget about me making my own game&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have anywhere to point us so that we can learn how to do <br/>\nthis QUICK?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the meantime, does anyone know of any pre-programmed computer <br/>\ngames that let kids design their own games?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47501,"nextTopicId":50043}}
