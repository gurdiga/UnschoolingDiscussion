The Mennonite group I personally know and spent a good bit of time with is in Lobelville (sp?). Over a 3 yr time period, I occasionally worked with them, ate with them, ran errands for them, took care of animals with them, and once helped with a barn-raising. I was fortunate to have had friends who were well-known and trusted in the community, and they accepted me quickly. I made quite a few good friends while I was there. Their way of teaching the children to behave was that when the child did something &quot;unacceptable&quot; everyone (including other children) would turn their backs or otherwise ignore the child until he/she quit whatever it was. The mothers carried their babies in slings everywhere until the child was old enough (usually around the age of 2 or 3) to follow and keep up, and then the boys usually went with their papa, while girls stayed with mama. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I picked up on that not telling about new babies too, and actually had a very hard time telling others about my first two pregnancies! <br/>\nMyranda   <br/>\n  Myranda,<br/>\n     I hope that I am not throwing cold water on your idea of the<br/>\n  Mennonites but we lived around 4 groups of them and I never heard any of<br/>\n  them say they did not believe in spanking.

I know that children were spanked as we had<br/>\n  discussions on it...albeit rarely as they are very private people.<br/>\n    About their children never crying...I did not see that either. They are<br/>\n  &quot;taught&quot; very young not to cry loudly.<br/>\n  They do cuddle and take time for their children probably more than the<br/>\n  norm and are for the most part gentle and loving but there is still &quot;do<br/>\n  as you are told&gt;&quot; The feeling of community is very strong and if you do<br/>\n  not abide by the community rules the alternative can be more than most<br/>\n  can handle.<br/>\n    As for them being the truest christians around (my wording not yours)<br/>\n  may come from our looking in at a group of people that we rarely get to<br/>\n  see behind closed doors.<br/>\n    They have there fair share of in fighting and petty problems...they are<br/>\n  just as human as you and I.<br/>\n  One of the things I always thought interesting is they do not tell their<br/>\n  children when a new baby is expected.
