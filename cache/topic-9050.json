Because I spent years doing curriculum with my<br/>\nkids and that&#39;s just not how they learned.  I finally realized that most of<br/>\nwhat they were learning was when pursuing their own interests but that I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t leaving much time for their own interests.  What I was teaching<br/>\nwasn&#39;t sticking so why waste my time?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many children do you have, how old, and names?  4 kids: Kate:almost 14,<br/>\nLisa:11, Karl:9 and Ben:4<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Hmm, the boys build with<br/>\nlegos, blocks, K-nex, and some other things I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re<br/>\ncalled.  We have recently discussed insects and book making.  Kate wants to<br/>\nlearn to make a web page and Lisa is busy with her volunteer work at the<br/>\nlibrary.  Kate also reads at least a book a day.  We are all currently<br/>\nre-reading (aloud) the Little House books.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHat area does your family live in?  The Midwest<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  Yes. No<br/>\nrestrictions at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDO you have any pets?  no<br/>\n<br/>\nANy thing else you&#39;d like to add: We are at the beginning of our unschooling<br/>\njourney but are so much happier.  The kids are learning more and we have<br/>\ntime now for more reading aloud and going to the many museums and zoos and<br/>\nsuch in our area. We live in the suburbs and I love it, we are not into<br/>\nnatural eating (though we do eat fairly healthy), we are learing to<br/>\nincorporate the many great TV shows on cable into our learning, and though I<br/>\nlove my kids dearly and they are well adjusted, we do not do what you would<br/>\ncall attachment parenting. Just thought I would add some diversity to the<br/>\nlist! LOL  (as though this group isn&#39;t diverse!, I just seem to be in the<br/>\nminority with these things, but that&#39;s OK by me.  I love the wisdom I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen here).<br/>\n<br/>\nApril</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Michelle Harper","from":"&quot;Michelle Harper&quot; &lt;earthmagik@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BdXFGbS0vOa_3OZapPeYokoqoAIZW3g5GOiLP7f06ucGGC6XPXOGig0rG-mZOD2mDzK6FZvDO3XPLNeG9bUi5mzd9Cv_9bsZlTD4r-D7sVYIRxhw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Meeting new people..Fill in the blanks...Please.","postDate":"960507539","msgId":9050,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWJmZDFhMiRjZWRhOGRjMCQ0ZDIwNzlhNUBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9056,"prevInTime":9049,"nextInTime":9051,"topicId":9050,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HI All!!
