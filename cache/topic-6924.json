I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.  And to those who<br/>\nwere offended  by &quot;the title&quot; , I apologize.  I don&#39;t want to offend<br/>\nanyone, as a matter of fact, I&#39;d like to feel like I have some friends<br/>\nout there, somewhere.This has been a very stressful time, and I tend to<br/>\nget a little lonely.<br/>\nThanks to all who  offered advice  and words of encouragment.  It&#39;s nice<br/>\nto know that I&#39;m not the only mother in the world who has a child who<br/>\nspins in circles when he&#39;s tired !! I&#39;m just gonna try to relax and let<br/>\nmy boy be a boy, even if that means letting him bounce off the walls !!<br/>\nSus</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6891,"nextTopicId":6821}}
