The whole idea of sermons and no input from the <br/>\n&lt;congregation REALLY bothers me. I don&#39;t think that church was meant <br/>\n&lt;to be a performance that we watch but a community that we participate <br/>\n&lt;in. <br/>\n&lt;Sheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I am Unitarian! The services are very open. We are not<br/>\n&quot;Preached to&quot; we ask questions and interact with our pastor and for that<br/>\nmatter not all &quot;sermons&quot; are delivered by the pastor , anyone can present<br/>\nif they have something to share/teach/discuss. I am also a practicing pagan<br/>\nand I&#39;m not comfortable calling myself a  Christian. I actually believe<br/>\ntheir is beauty and truth in ALL spiritual practices/religions and I like<br/>\nto feel free to receive from them all, as I think most on this list do. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to promote any religion over another. I agree that the best<br/>\npolicy is to read/learn/think for yourself, but if some of you are looking<br/>\nfor a &quot;church&quot; like this, you should really check out your local Unitarian<br/>\nFellowship. I&#39;m actually kind of enjoying this thread, I like to hear from<br/>\n&quot;Christians&quot; who are dissatisfied with the way their religion is perceived/<br/>\norganized/etc. It&#39;s really nice to be reminded that not all Christians are<br/>\nfundamentalists who are out to take away our religious freedom!<br/>\n<br/>\nTrisha Sides<br/>\nKats Coffees N&#39; More<br/>\nHaven Book Recycling<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.ebay.com/aboutme/yschild/\">http://members.ebay.com/aboutme/yschild/</a><br/>\n&quot;A library of wisdom, is more precious than all wealth, and all things that<br/>\nare desirable cannot be compared to it.
