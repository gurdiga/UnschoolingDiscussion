He has a learning<br/>\ndisability and has major test anxiety.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do unschoolers prepare a portfolio?  What should go in, how much<br/>\ninfo should be given, how should it be organized, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have all of his public school IEP&#39;s along with samples of school<br/>\nwork from then.  Should these be included as a &quot;starting point&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nDS works at a local TV station one day a week.  He runs the camera<br/>\nfor a live show and is learning all aspects of production.  He also<br/>\nruns the sound system for our childrens church (and will<br/>\nsoon &quot;graduate&quot; to the youth sound system).  Video and sound are the<br/>\ntwo main areas of interest in DS&#39;s life.  He already is pretty sure<br/>\nthat he wants to go into sound/video as an adult.  I am making<br/>\narrangements for him to also &quot;work&quot; (observe) at a recording<br/>\nstudio.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is done only when he needs to read something like<br/>\ninstructions, internet access/info, etc.  He is certainly not one<br/>\nwho wants to pick up a book and &quot;read for fun&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has taught himself how to make a slide show with music on his<br/>\nlaptop.  Has taught himself quite a bit about digital photography,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t have many of his multiplication facts memorized but knows<br/>\nhow to use a calculator to get information that he might need.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has a small dog and is completely responsible for it&#39;s daily<br/>\ncare.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally, he spends the day at our large church working where<br/>\nneeded.  Usually cleaning, organizing, etc.  I am trying to instill<br/>\ngood work ethics in DS.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is truly ALMOST a perfect fit for this young man.  But<br/>\nhow in the world do I document what we are learning/living in our<br/>\ndaily life</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101518,"nextTopicId":111800}}
