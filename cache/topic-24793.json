We finally realized why it bugs <br/>\nBryan so much. . . he was not allowed to jump on furniture when he was young <br/>\nand he wants to join in with Quinton. Problem is when he does, he breaks <br/>\nthings!! LOL It bugs LElia cause she hates seeing the cushions all strewn <br/>\nabout. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ddzimlew@juno.com","from":"ddzimlew@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"n8s5LAj_ViswS7qMv9PniJ_L1SxP36CwDnQ7cjVVi8qLZt6BGUaBatjfTPelmduKDSra7tttcAI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Moving from relaxed homeschooling to unschooling","postDate":"1000045780","msgId":24809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTA5LjA4Mjk1MC4tMTAwOTM5LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":24793,"nextInTopic":24810,"prevInTime":24808,"nextInTime":24810,"topicId":24793,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For the first time yesterday we went to rent videos and I let Zak <br/>\npick whichever one he wanted.  He picked Simba (the Lion King II) and the <br/>\nLand Before Time V.  I was internally in a bit of a panic that he might pick <br/>\nup the Godzilla movie in the adult section he was looking at.  So how do you <br/>\ndetermine what&#39;s ok and what&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if Zak decided he wanted to watch the Godzilla movie (which looked <br/>\nscarey even for me).
