We get dissconnected from our kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when they are in school.I think once you get the connection the<br/>\n&gt; fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt; begins and the journey happens - natrually. Naturally is the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; keyword - I was trying to do school things when I first got my son<br/>\n&gt; &gt; home out of fear. This is my second year and it&#39;s more relaxing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because we just live and have fun.  I would describe it as a way<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life.  I still tell the school oh yeah he is reading and doing<br/>\n&gt; math<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just to shut them up - but in our home and in my heart I know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything will happen all natrually :) I let my son guide and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; direct me I listen to him carefully for what he desires to know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about.  That is what I&#39;m doing for myself now as an adult and what<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gift it is  to be able to do it as a child with the help of your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parents.  I have let go of all my fears of the video game thing -<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never wanted to buy one for fear that he would play all day and<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learn. Well guess what he plays all day and still learns.  I<br/>\n&gt; thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how will he learn how to read and I find that he is asking &quot;what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; does this say - and that ??&quot;  The wheels are turning for him<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is something he wants.  He does math in his own way and we play<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lots of games.  You have fun and your together but theres great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learning involved in it. That is the beauty of being home you have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time to do what you love and why shouldn&#39;t you.He does what he<br/>\n&gt; loves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I do what I love and then we do what we love to do together :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Theres many lessons to be learned in life - everything is a<br/>\n&gt; learning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; exsperience.  Everything - moving to a new home and remodeling<br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is what we did our first year of home school LOL... Your son might<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be feeding on your fear ... I don&#39;t know but I think my son use to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel mine.  Now I see he is more relaxed now that I am.  He also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sees me explain my philosopy to other people. I also tell him not<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worry about others and what they think because you have to do<br/>\n&gt; whats<br/>\n&gt; &gt; right for yourself. They do not live our life and we don&#39;t owe<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ANY explanations.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your doing the right thing Amy. Love, Live and learn and be happy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Connect and know that everything works out - natrually :)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sonya<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 07 Nov 2003 19:04:43 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Antiquity and getting facts clearly clear<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 11/7/03 6:54:01 AM, bunsofaluminum60@h... writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; If there&#39;s a discrepancy between documents about Jesus&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life, and one of the documents is older...the older document is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trusted over the newer one. That&#39;s how it is with all ancient<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; writings.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s not how historiography works in general.  A newer biography<br/>\n&gt; is often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trusted over an older one, and history is written for specific<br/>\n&gt; purposes and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different purposes by different historians, so you get different<br/>\n&gt; slants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you wanted to find out about Grant&#39;s life, would you rather read a<br/>\n&gt; biography written today by a historian who researched Grant&#39;s life,<br/>\n&gt; or would you read Grant&#39;s memoirs?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BUT! what if something came to light that claimed to be a portion of<br/>\n&gt; Grant&#39;s memoirs that had never been seen before, but mentions things<br/>\n&gt; that dispute all other primary sources? Would the historian trust the<br/>\n&gt; newer stuff that goes against all other sources, including the<br/>\n&gt; memoirs from the pen of the man, or would he let the newer stuff go<br/>\n&gt; as not reliable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What if Grant never wrote anything? Maybe someone close to him, who<br/>\n&gt; saw what happened, would be a reliable primary source? If a newer<br/>\n&gt; biography on Grant were published, and the historian cited sources<br/>\n&gt; that have been deemed unreliable by authoritative Grant scholars?<br/>\n&gt; What if the new biography mentions many events that are nowhere else<br/>\n&gt; mentioned? Do you believe the new biography if it doesn&#39;t check out<br/>\n&gt; with sources closer to the actual man?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IMO, the older documents (closer to the source) are going to be<br/>\n&gt; closer to the true events, and thus more trustworthy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I would say that the main discrepancy about what books are in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; canon is between having the apocrypha or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a modern view.  A historical view needs to see things all<br/>\n&gt; along the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; way.  There are many Bible-worshipping protestants (Baptist and<br/>\n&gt; thereabout) who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have no idea there are other books in the Catholic Bible, or how<br/>\n&gt; they got in,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or why they got out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your point? I&#39;m confident that I don&#39;t fall in the category of &quot;have<br/>\n&gt; no idea&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Any objective scholar will acknowledge that Biblical<br/>\n&gt; documentation is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; among the best, if not THE best, in existence.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A scholar who raises a question will show he&#39;s not objective?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; absolutely not. There&#39;s nothing wrong with raising questions AT ALL.<br/>\n&gt; Objectivity would be searching all sources, both higher criticism<br/>\n&gt; (which group disbelieves in supernatural or miraculous)and the<br/>\n&gt; scholars who do allow for the supernatural or miraculous. (don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; if that group has a name or label for their methods.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If a researcher wants answers to his questions, best ask everyone he<br/>\n&gt; can find who might know anything about the subject, basing his<br/>\n&gt; research criteria on quality of scholarship NOT on doubting OR<br/>\n&gt; believing that the Bible is reliable. Even scholars who are inclined<br/>\n&gt; to the higher criticism camp, acknowledge the extremely high level of<br/>\n&gt; quality of Biblical documentation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Okay, but my point was to try and refute the notion which is<br/>\n&gt; widely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taught, that &quot;all holidays celebrated originally by the Catholic<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; church have their origins in pagan traditions.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What I think people mean when they say that is that the holidays<br/>\n&gt; celebrated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the United States have pagan origins concerning the traditions<br/>\n&gt; with which<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are celebrated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You mean, &quot;The things we do traditionally TO celebrate these<br/>\n&gt; holidays.&quot; Right? Like lighting the Yule log or whatever...???<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, I think I get that now. :&#92; I think. But there still is a panic<br/>\n&gt; in evangelicaldom about following practices that originate in pagan<br/>\n&gt; tradition. They don&#39;t want to do things that are not commanded nor<br/>\n&gt; recommended in the Bible, but it is a misguided attempt at Christian<br/>\n&gt; living, IMO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And the only generally &quot;celebrated religious holidays&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; here outside Thanksgiving and 4th of July are Christmas and<br/>\n&gt; Easter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, T&#39;giving is a religious feast day, in that giving thanks to God<br/>\n&gt; was part of the intent of The First Thanksgiving, but it is also<br/>\n&gt; American, not Catholic, in origin. Goes to show, the puritans weren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; against feasting and celebrating, per se. Just didn&#39;t like the<br/>\n&gt; Catholic versions of things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; and of course 4th of July is a United States thing, not universal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Valentine&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Day was a medieval Saint&#39;s Day (most days were, and still are in<br/>\n&gt; the Catholic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; church and for purposes of baby-naming and the particulars of the<br/>\n&gt; daily<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mass), and Hallowe&#39;en, but the traditions don&#39;t have to do with<br/>\n&gt; church or Jesus,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I disagree. If a day is named after a saint...well, isn&#39;t a saint a<br/>\n&gt; part of the Church? Aren&#39;t &quot;All Saints&quot; a part of the church? Then,<br/>\n&gt; Valentine&#39;s and Hallowe&#39;en have to do with the church. And the church<br/>\n&gt; has to do with Jesus...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; blessings, HeidiC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Looking at all the history of religion through a 2003 American<br/>\n&gt; Protestant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lens is too distorting.  It&#39;s not at all objective.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 7 Nov 2003 13:32:09 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kelli Traaseth&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tktraas@...\">tktraas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Explaining Unschooling (also an  intro)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I think I am the only Kelli with an  * i *,    :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although now that I think of it, there was one around last year.<br/>\nHavn&#39;t heard from her in a while tho&#39;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kelli~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Tia Leschke<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Friday, November 07, 2003 11:32 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Explaining Unschooling (also an<br/>\nintro)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;And I&#39;ll put &quot;in IL&quot; after mine, no biggie.

You have<br/>\n&gt; to learn to make some little finger sandwiches and have them ready in<br/>\n&gt; baggies so the kids can grab them out of the refrigerator. You have to<br/>\n&gt; have cereal to use as a quick munchie. Etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If candy and cookies and things like that are sitting around and<br/>\n&gt; available, that&#39;s the first thing people will grab if they&#39;re a little<br/>\n&gt; hungry and need a snack or if they sense their blood sugar dropping.<br/>\n&gt; You have to have appealing-to-kids and quick-to-grab food be as easy to<br/>\n&gt; get to as the candy bowl.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As kids get older, they will go in and fix their own real food - they<br/>\n&gt; will be used to having something more substantial than a pile of candy<br/>\n&gt; when they are hungry and that won&#39;t be so appealing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; National Home Education Network<br/>\n&gt; &lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Serving the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\n&gt; through information, networking and public relations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 7 Nov 2003 13:06:29 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Penn Acres&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pennacres@...\">pennacres@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Scott<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your unschooling &quot;tract&quot; cards? sounds kewl-have to have a better look at<br/>\nyour site  asap.<br/>\n&gt;  prob. deleted your unschooling bio-how old are your kids?<br/>\n&gt; I am so rabidly  anti- proselytizing  that I wouldnt buy them to hand out<br/>\nat &quot;Halloween&quot; but  I think something in &quot;comic book style&quot;  for kids  to<br/>\nget a kick out of the ideas inherent in unschooling might be  a real  treat.<br/>\nthe &quot;anti-public school&quot;  would be for Me!  and the chosen few...<br/>\n&gt; grace<br/>\n&gt; In the frigid Canadian Rockies  where it was -18 C last night-again!!! and<br/>\nI am going out to the kennel  so the girls can help me flea bathe a cat..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 6<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 7 Nov 2003 15:04:05 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Limits/showering<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/7/03 12:38:29 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;        Maybe several of us could use some encouraging perspective from<br/>\n&gt; unschooling moms whose sons USED to be like this and aren&#39;t anymore!  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kirby and Marty used to be like that and aren&#39;t anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They take a shower every day because they want to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There were times when I would just go in and open the windows in Kirby&#39;s<br/>\nroom<br/>\n&gt; and aim a fan out to vent the boy-smell, but I didn&#39;t do it hatefully,<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; gently.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I&#39;d ask one of them to change his shirt if we were going<br/>\nsomewhere,<br/>\n&gt; and he would.

Like cake vs. carrots at dinner<br/>\n&gt; or games vs. TV for recreation.

Sometimes they would eat the cake first and then the meat.  I<br/>\n&gt; wanted them to see/understand that sometimes you want to eat cake and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes you want the steak.  Sometimes you want to read a book and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes you want to watch TV.  Sometimes you want to ride your bike and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes you want to stay in and color.
