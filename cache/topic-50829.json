It&#39;s available from Nature&#39;s Way which is at most Health <br/>\nfood stores.<br/>\nThen you do an Acsorbic acid flush on the sick ones to get all the germs out <br/>\nof their systems. You can mix the powder with juice for those that don&#39;t like <br/>\nfunny flavors. It&#39;s subtle, but obvious in water.<br/>\nThere are directions for an acsorbic acid flush in most alternative medicine <br/>\nbooks (or probably online) but the measurements would depend on the size of <br/>\nthe person and how potent your acsorbic acid powder was.<br/>\nBasically, it&#39;s high doses of vitamin C (only in the powder acsorbic acid <br/>\nform) that causes your body to flush all toxins and germs. It goes into a <br/>\nstrong cleansing mode and is really great for your body. Some people do a <br/>\npreventive flush once a month.<br/>\nGarlic (acts as an antibiotic) and Cayenne supplements are really great when <br/>\nyou&#39;re sick also.<br/>\nThose few herbs have kept us healthy or gotten us over an illness very <br/>\nquickly.<br/>\nWe use homeopathics in addition, depending on the symptoms. <br/>\nWe also keep Charcoal tablets around for any stomache problems that may <br/>\narise. It will flush out germs quickly and keep you from having to be ill <br/>\nwhen coming down with stomache flu. Miraculous stuff!<br/>\nSome homeopathic remedies no parent should be without:<br/>\nArnica (both topical gel and pill form) for bruises<br/>\nPulsatilla for snotty green/yellow discharge, clinginess (wants to be held <br/>\nall the time) weepy type colds<br/>\nBelladonna for sudden fevers<br/>\nChammomilla for irritable, cranky or hyper<br/>\nLedum Palustra for puncture wounds<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot more, and one would need to take into account all symptoms to <br/>\nfind the proper remedy. But we&#39;ve done well with self diagnoses and <br/>\nhomeopathics, the arnica has saved my babies from some nasty bruises.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>\nWhat&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>\n                           -Zilpha Keatley Snyder<br/>\nUnschooling support at pensacolaunschoolers.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45755436,"authorName":"susan marie","from":"susan marie &lt;scribblers2@...&gt;","profile":"scribblers2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sick kids","postDate":"1038669257","msgId":50853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MEI4MzY2LTA0NzYtMTFENy04RTQ4LTAwMzA2NUZCODJCOEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBMERGNzRDLjEwMTNEJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":50852,"nextInTopic":50855,"prevInTime":50852,"nextInTime":50854,"topicId":50829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve been using diet to help keep us healthier.

Right now my kids will only take medicine that <br/>\nhappens to be orange in color and flavor.  It stinks.  And of course, when <br/>\nthey get sick next time, they will demand another color.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, in particular, doesn&#39;t eat or drink during the first few days of <br/>\na bad cold or asthma attack.  We just had croup here, it was awful.  I resort <br/>\nto threatening pedyalite and using a dropper.  Usually before that I&#39;ll buy <br/>\nall sorts of stuff that I think might be appealing or fun.  Popsicles, <br/>\npudding, jello, different juices, it&#39;s all an exerice in futility.  she tends <br/>\nto vomit with mucus production and after that, all food and drink are bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did find those lollipop cough drops this time around, they worked.  Zinc <br/>\nlozenges made for kids, I think.  I didn&#39;t buy them.  And carrot/apple vruit <br/>\njuice worked this time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a challenge.  I&#39;m sorry you are going through this now, today.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"sick kids","postDate":"1038545188","msgId":50829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNTNIWWZUcTFyYjlDTFZwejYwMDAwODNmY0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50830,"prevInTime":50828,"nextInTime":50830,"topicId":50829,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Has anyone found anything that their kids will take when sick?
