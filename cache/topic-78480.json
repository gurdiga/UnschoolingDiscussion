We headed out to the bush to get some more<br/>\nfirewood. jWe found millipedes, geckos of all sizes, all sorts of fungus and<br/>\na lot of the wildflowers are starting to bloom so it was really pretty out<br/>\nthree. The boys chose to help us too which was great. So now it&#39;s raining<br/>\nand we have lots of wood, just going to get a fire started now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s such a good feeling to have the whole family working together<br/>\npeacefully. Jacob kept bringing us drinks when we looked thirsty which was<br/>\nreally sweet. So much better when they do stuff without any prompting just<br/>\nbecause they love you and they see you doing it for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
