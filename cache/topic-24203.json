in fact i printed it off<br/>\nfor my son storm to read!! just last night he was saying things similar to<br/>\nwhat your son has been saying to you.. he wants more work to do.. we have<br/>\nbeen unschooling for three years now and he has been the one to give me the<br/>\nmost challenges with it.. i am constantly printing off things for him to do,<br/>\nlast night however i threw it right back at him.. i told him he had all the<br/>\nfreedom in the world to learn anythng he wanted to do that i was not his<br/>\nteacher and  but that i would help him in anything i could i told him he has<br/>\naccess to anything in the world with the computer and a whole community to<br/>\nask questions and explore i told im he was free to take any classes i was<br/>\ncapeable to gt him to as he is only 13 y.o.i told him he probably needs to<br/>\nlimit his t.v. time and i will make them change the channel if i think<br/>\ncartoons have been on way too long.. generally i do not allow them to just<br/>\nsit and waych t. v. i throw them outside!! but back to the subject.. i<br/>\nbasically threw it right back at him and told him it was his responsibility<br/>\nto decide wht he wanted to learn and how.. he is very competitive and always<br/>\nwant s to be one step ahead of everyone else so i suggested that he call the<br/>\nprincipal fo the local high schools himself and ask about takeing classes..<br/>\nwhich he will not do but i still threw it in.. i suggested that he could<br/>\ntake classes with the 4 h or whatever he wanted to do.. i  ordered some<br/>\nbooks from cobblestone  and i told him they even sent a teachers guide so he<br/>\ncould look at it and do the lessons if he felt the need.. i offered to hepl<br/>\nhim with anything but told him i was not the teacher and he had choices to<br/>\nmake and he was the only one who could make them well we will see...  i did<br/>\nnot point out to him all the learning he does when he is building entire<br/>\ncities outside with blocks of sawed off wood.. or when he sits for hours and<br/>\ndesigns cities etc... he so far does not see that as learning.. and i told<br/>\nhim that he is actually lucky to have been able to be with his dad when he<br/>\ntore down an entire old barn.. and now they are rebuilding a barn on our<br/>\nland with the materials .. he also does not see that as learning.. so with<br/>\nthis kid i guess i will continue to print off pages for him to do untill he<br/>\ngets sick of it maybe???<br/>\n<br/>\n hope you feel better knowing i have a kid like you have!!

Look where that gets us! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think obedience is a fine thing to teach dogs and horses, however.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Respect to me boils down almost entirely to the golden rule, karma, or<br/>\n&gt; whatever else we want to call it: Treat others as you would like to be<br/>\n&gt; treated, because that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen anyway. (Hmm, maybe we<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt; call that Golden Karma &lt;eg&gt;).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, if your husband &quot;obeys&quot; the children -- i.e, complies with their<br/>\n&gt; reasonable requests for time, attention, things, &quot;instantly&quot; he may find<br/>\n&gt; that sooner or later the children will respect him in the same way. (Maybe<br/>\n&gt; not, personalities will differ).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If your husband breaks promises (intentionally or through forgetfulness),<br/>\n&gt; says, &quot;in a minute&quot; and forgets (I&#39;m horribly guilty of that one because I<br/>\n&gt; have a hard focus, it&#39;s something I&#39;m trying VERY hard to retrain myself<br/>\n&gt; on), says, &quot;you didn&#39;t say please&quot; to them but doesn&#39;t say &quot;please&quot; when<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; asks them for something, or expects them to give a great deal more than<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; get from him (or even AS MUCH as they get -- the balance from a parent<br/>\n&gt; giving time or attention or services to a young child is necessarily much<br/>\n&gt; greater than the reciprocal), it all boils down to reasonable and<br/>\n&gt; unreasonable expectations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In this household, kindness and safety and honesty (my work in progress)<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; the key points. Obedience doesn&#39;t even make the top 10, except for the<br/>\n&gt; puppy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pam<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1407<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, Sep 4, 2001, 1:09 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 23<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Tue, 4 Sep 2001 14:51:43 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: &quot;Sheri Piersol&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheri@...\">sheri@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: What is respect?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My husband and I are at odds (not uncommon) about wether the kids are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respectful or disrespectful. I think my husband confuses obedience with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respect. Just because the kids don&#39;t immediately obey, my husband gets<br/>\nupset<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because they don&#39;t respect me. I feel they do respect me, just don&#39;t<br/>\nalways<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obey. So, how does one show respect? Is disobedience always a sign of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disrespect? I mean the kids do obey, just not right away. I think we<br/>\nhave a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great amount of respect for one another, but don&#39;t want to be fooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself.

And I was glad to see them discussed.  To me, and I think I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard<br/>\n&gt; it said before, unschooling encompasses just about everything.  There is a<br/>\n&gt; general worldview that seems to be shared by many unschoolers that I love.<br/>\n&gt; That of questioning, allowing and not limiting.  There are varieties in<br/>\n&gt; different areas, bit I don&#39;t want to feel like getting &#39;off topic&#39; is a<br/>\nbad<br/>\n&gt; thing.  Again, I&#39;m a competent adult, and if I see something I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; read, I delete it.  I just subscribed to another homeschooling list and it<br/>\n&gt; seems much more dogmatic and not what I&#39;m interested in, but I&#39;m giving it<br/>\n&gt; some time....I might get something out of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering if the heat is just really getting to everyone.

Also, most of the topics are<br/>\n&gt; interesting to me, they don&#39;t need to center solely on<br/>\n&gt; unschooling- everything is part of our lives, and I<br/>\n&gt; just skim over & delete the ones that aren&#39;t currently<br/>\n&gt; of interest to me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; Michele<br/>\n&gt; (mom of 5dd: Justice 22, Felicity 20, Christian 18, Grace 13, Elysian<br/>\n(Mia)2)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!<br/>\nMessenger<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://im.yahoo.com\">http://im.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 04 Sep 2001 19:23:15 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: Ann &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mumsienc@...\">mumsienc@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: unschoolers and information sources<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree Brenda...<br/>\n&gt; I use the delete key for anything that just doesn&#39;t seem relevant to me.<br/>\n&gt; BUT....it is usually relevant to others, and that&#39;s what life and<br/>\nunschooling is<br/>\n&gt; all about.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for saying so nicely.<br/>\n&gt; There are lots of times I don&#39;t agree with the opinions expressed, but<br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; everyone has an opinion, and everyone can express it...I&#39;m not going to<br/>\nattack<br/>\n&gt; someone or get upset about someone having a different opinion than mine.<br/>\nIt is<br/>\n&gt; the way of the world, and thank goodness I have my trusty delete key.<br/>\n&gt; Ann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 4 Sep 2001 17:58:32 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our experience was when we went to pick up two yearling Arab fillies and<br/>\n&gt; were coming back over the pass.  I know it is only about 10,000 feet at<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; summit but I&#39;m sure it is really 10 MILLION feet down &lt;g&gt;  For those that<br/>\n&gt; have never been there, you come up and then it is like someone cut the top<br/>\n&gt; off and the road is instantly flat so you don&#39;t really see what might be<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; front of you.  There was a gal parked right smack dab in the middle of the<br/>\n&gt; road standing by her car.  We had three choices, hit her, the 10 million<br/>\n&gt; feet down the cliff face or putting the truck into the snow bank on the up<br/>\n&gt; side cliff face.  My sister and I were in a panic because the last vehicle<br/>\n&gt; we passed was a big rig pulling half a modular home.  All we could picture<br/>\n&gt; was horses plastered all over the road.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At any rate, we got the fillies out and up the hill and tied to a couple<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; trees. Then we went to deal with the one taco short of a combination<br/>\nplate!<br/>\n&gt; Seems she had never driven in the snow before and the black ice scared<br/>\nher.<br/>\n&gt; O.K., I can deal with that EXCEPT her husband was asleep in the back seat<br/>\n&gt; and she didn&#39;t want to wake him up because he really needed the sleep!<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t know who was more peeved at her, us or him.  When he asked her why<br/>\nshe<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t wake him up (not in those words &lt;g&gt;), she said &quot;But you look so<br/>\nsweet<br/>\n&gt; and peaceful.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Grrrr, did I mention one guy had already gone off the road?  We luckily<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; a winch on the truck to pull him back up the hill!  Oh, and the truck with<br/>\n&gt; the modular had pulled off so the driver could take 10.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: amy mathews &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tlcamy@...\">tlcamy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 04, 2001 11:28 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we are very far from parker but, also very familiar with it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; funny thing about the passes here, most Colorado drivers don&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; problems but out of state vehicles are more sluggish, has to do with air<br/>\n&gt; mixture I think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we have family in Iowa and are car runs much faster there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I no what you mean about everyone being cousins or related<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ditto here<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   From: Lynda<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Sunday, September 02, 2001 11:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] lynda<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Well, we are on the coast.

I have visited unschooling.com numerous times<br/>\n&gt; and I just signed on to the loop. Here&#39;s a brief backgound....<br/>\n&gt;    Although I have been reading John Holt for years this is my first<br/>\n&gt; step to unschool my children. We have three kids, Zach (9), Drew (6),<br/>\n&gt; and Chloe (who has always been unschooled...4 yrs.) Well, the boys<br/>\n&gt; were excited to be &quot;homeschooled&quot; this year and Thursday August 30th<br/>\n&gt; was spent at a park day for all the homeschoolers/unschoolers in our<br/>\n&gt; area. A few days have passed now and my oldest faces me today and<br/>\n&gt; loudly announces that I have not taught him A THING and how is he<br/>\n&gt; supposed to learn!!!?? So, I say quite calmly, well what would you<br/>\n&gt; like to learn?? He gets quite angry at my reponse and replies, &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know! You are just supposed to be teaching me something! I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t just watch T.V. all day!&quot; LOL I laugh because my oldest is my<br/>\n&gt; most television addicted child. I respond, &quot;anything you want to do<br/>\n&gt; is fine with me...math, science, play a game, anything.&quot; He walked<br/>\n&gt; away in a huff.  A short time later he did bring out a game and we<br/>\n&gt; all played. I could tell he was still very bothered by my lack<br/>\n&gt; of &quot;formal lessons&quot; and after the game was finished I brought out his<br/>\n&gt; math book from the last school year. I showed him the book and<br/>\n&gt; explained to him that the work inside was extremely easy (it is far<br/>\n&gt; below his abilities) and he agreed. I then showed him that out of an<br/>\n&gt; entire year the book had not even been halfway completed. I pointed<br/>\n&gt; out that I felt if he wanted to do it he could sit and complete the<br/>\n&gt; entire book in a day or two. He wouldn&#39;t have to wait for the teacher<br/>\n&gt; or for kids who did not understand, etc..  He kind of laughed in<br/>\n&gt; agreement with me. He did not, and I did not expect him to, work in<br/>\n&gt; the book but helped put the game away and went back to the T.V.<br/>\n&gt;     I can tell he does not grasp what I am explaining fully. He still<br/>\n&gt; does not understand why I am not sitting down and &quot;teaching&quot; him.<br/>\n&gt; Is &quot;unschooling&quot; a philosphy that I should sit and explain to him in<br/>\n&gt; detail?  I have made numerous points to him but never totally and<br/>\n&gt; completely explained. The funny thing is I expected him to be<br/>\n&gt; thrilled by the fact that he was not going to be made to &quot;work&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; instead his reaction caught me totally offguard!! I really should<br/>\n&gt; have known better!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    By the way....the television is somewhat of a problem. My husband<br/>\n&gt; will not let me take it out of the house, which is what I want to do!<br/>\n&gt; My son CAN sit in front of that thing for hours if I were to let him<br/>\n&gt; and I almost feel he has been doing just that for the past couple<br/>\n&gt; days as a silent protest against my method of &quot;instruction.&quot; He did<br/>\n&gt; not watch much television over the summer and now he cannot seem to<br/>\n&gt; be able to shut it off. Of course, it may be that all of his<br/>\n&gt; neighborhood friends have gone off to school. For the time being<br/>\n&gt; should I plan lots of activity in the home...experiments, read<br/>\n&gt; outloud time, playing games, etc...my car is broken down and won&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt; ready for a least a week. Some unschoolers believe that I should just<br/>\n&gt; let boredom take it&#39;s toll and let the kids lead the activity when<br/>\n&gt; they are ready.  Any thoughts on this??????<br/>\n&gt;             Thank you all...I would appreciate ANY input!<br/>\n&gt;                            Tara<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 13<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 5 Sep 2001 16:30:14 +0900<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;noemi hiraishi&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:noeminh@...\">noeminh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Thank you for the Welcome<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was very comforting and nice to read Mary welcome me into the<br/>\n&gt; list. I know that many more of you there have said a silent<br/>\n&gt; welcome to my self introduction.  I just wanted to know how much<br/>\n&gt; it meant to me. It is still hard not to hear the voice deep<br/>\n&gt; inside me saying that I am not a native English speaker/writer<br/>\n&gt; and that I am exposing myself publicly. The complex of having<br/>\n&gt; been born in in-development-country is still here.  I know that<br/>\n&gt; it does not count.
