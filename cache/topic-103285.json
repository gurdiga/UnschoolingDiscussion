Grandmama is <br/>\nan  ex-schoolteacher who has been supportive of homeschooling but since we <br/>\nstarted  unschooling has not been getting the feedback she is comfortable  with.  <br/>\n <br/>\nDuring the year, I can usually answer her questions on the phone with the  <br/>\nactivites the kids are involved with and move on to the weather. I had to smile  <br/>\nwhen I heard Brenna (15) respond on the phone yesterday, &quot;No grandmama I&#39;m <br/>\nnot  taking any classes but I was reading &quot;The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;  <br/>\ntoday.  It&quot;s an inquiry into values.  How are you and Grandad doing?  We are <br/>\nreally looking forward to your visit.&quot;  She can just nail it  sometimes.  I <br/>\noften give too much information instead of changing the  subject.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried different approaches but I really don&#39;t want Logan (11) to feel  <br/>\nuncomfortable this year with her questioning of his &quot;schoolwork&quot;.  At the  same <br/>\ntime, I don&#39;t want to make any waves with her.  We  have been able to <br/>\nmaintain a close relationship in these 8 years since  her son and I were divorced.   <br/>\nThey are only here for 3  days. Right now, Logan spends most of his time on <br/>\nthe computer with an  occasional video game or TV show thrown in.  He&#39;s very <br/>\ninvolved in some  complex games online.  How can I avoid or redirect the <br/>\nquestions I&#39;m  anticipating about math, writing etc. in a positive way while they are <br/>\nvisiting. <br/>\n <br/>\nSome of my thoughts have been to just &quot;strew&quot; things around Logan has  <br/>\ncreated...robots,<br/>\nelectrical creations etc.  In years past, I used to just show her the  <br/>\nportfolios of all their &quot;work&quot; which she loved!  All those worksheets and  writing <br/>\nsamples in these creative books. How could a former 2nd grade teacher  not love <br/>\nthat?  My mistake!! :-)  Now I have boxes of pictures and  &quot;stuff&quot; thrown <br/>\ninto boxes.
