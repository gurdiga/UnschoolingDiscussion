The only difference is that she still sleeps with us. So, what I do now, instead of getting all frustrated about what she wants to do vs. what I&#39;d like her to do, is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nI lay down in bed, shut the lights off (except for a night light we have in the bedroom) and say, &quot;Ok I&#39;m going to sleep now, if you don&#39;t want to sleep you can do whatever you want, but you&#39;ve gotta let me sleep because I&#39;m tired.&quot; Sometimes she goes out of the room, sometimes she stays there and goes to sleep. It doesn&#39;t matter, the point is that I give myself the chance to relax about the situation by saying &#39;you do what you want and I do what I want&#39;. As she has a choice, she usually chooses to stay with me and sleep, but sometimes she goes out and does something else until she realizes that I&#39;m serious about the sleep thing, or realizes that nobody is going to pay attention to her anymore, or finishes doing what she wanted to do. And I rest my eyes in the meantime. If I still need to do things after<br/>\nshe falls asleep I get up again, after that little break, and do whatever I need to do. I&#39;ve told to my husband, who is way more controlling than I am when it comes to putting her to bed, to try this and he relaxes about the situation as well, and things work better for him too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that laying down and being quiet seems more conducive to sleep than fighting with her about it, because now it&#39;s her choice, it&#39;s not a control issue anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if your dh is not supportive in that way, well perhaps you need a long talk about your priorities and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps and good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OK. I am trying to give up control. I really am. But I seem to be still fighting it. Most<br/>\n&gt; the time I am ok with it, but I feel like there needs to be some balance and I am having<br/>\n&gt; a hard time finding it. I keep second guessing myself...am I responding to his needs...<br/>\n&gt; am I neglecting mine... how do I know?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The latest thing is bedtime. I have always had a love/hate thing with sleeping and Jason.<br/>\n&gt; When he was about a year, I finally surrendered to my reality and started co-sleeping.<br/>\n&gt; I would nurse/lay with him until he fell asleep. When he was 2, he went through a phase of<br/>\n&gt; not falling asleep easily, so I let him stay up. Finally around 3 things seemed to<br/>\n&gt; even out...he had given up his naps so he was easily falling asleep around 9. He<br/>\n&gt; stayed in our room until he was 4 yrs old and then I would still lay down with him<br/>\n&gt; to fall asleep. Last year we had progressed to where I could lay with him for a little<br/>\n&gt; while and then leave. Then he started having problems falling asleep again, so I would<br/>\n&gt; let him stay up in my craft room with me while I did my rubber stamping. He would tell<br/>\n&gt; me when he was tired and fall asleep easily. The first couple of weeks he stayed up until<br/>\n&gt; 10 or 11. After that he would ask to go to sleep around 8:30 and 9. I felt vindicated! I had<br/>\n&gt; always said that he would be able to self-regulate when given the choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now it is a year later and things have changed. Part of it I am sure is because it is<br/>\n&gt; cold out and we are not getting out as much. Part of it is that he no longer has to<br/>\n&gt; get up at 8 am for preschool. Plus he is not getting as much activity now (in addition<br/>\n&gt; to the activity at the preschool, we usually would play with  his best friend (who<br/>\n&gt; we car pooled with) after school for an hour or more). He is staying up until 11 (or<br/>\n&gt; later). If I let him sleep until he wakes up, he sleeps until around 9.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The problem is this...I am feeling smothered. Jason is a very intense little boy.<br/>\n&gt; I love him to death but he is an extrovert in the extreme sense of the word. If he<br/>\n&gt; is awake, he wants interaction. He will play by himself (for short periods of time),<br/>\n&gt; but never alone - he never goes into his own room to play alone. The worst feeling<br/>\n&gt; in the world for him is to feel lonely. Most of his favorite activities include some<br/>\n&gt; other person. He has never been the type to color at the table while I do the dishes...<br/>\n&gt; he always wanted me to color *with* him. It has gotten a bit better now that Kyle is<br/>\n&gt; getting older (will be 3 in Feb), takes some of the pressure off me. I am coming to<br/>\n&gt; accept this part of his personality and trying to work with it...we invite friends<br/>\n&gt; over often (still trying to make some hsing connections so we can find more friends<br/>\n&gt; during the day).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kyle has just given up his naps and is usually asleep by 9. And up by 7:30. Plus<br/>\n&gt; something is going on and he has started nursing a lot at night (he starts out in<br/>\n&gt; Jason&#39;s room and then I get him when he wakes up) so I have not been getting too<br/>\n&gt; much sleep. So now I have been trying to get to bed around midnight...which if Jason<br/>\n&gt; is not asleep until 11 or later does not leave much time for me to get anything done.<br/>\n&gt; I do get out to rubber stamping clubs about 3 or 4 times a month. Getting up earlier<br/>\n&gt; does not help because 7:30 is pretty early for me if I have been up a couple of times<br/>\n&gt; a night and if I get up early, Kyle usually gets up early too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been trying to talk with Jason about how mommy has needs to...that there are a lot<br/>\n&gt; of boring things that I try to leave for when he is asleep. How mommy needs down time and likes<br/>\n&gt; to have time alone with daddy or by herself. I think that what is getting to me lately is that<br/>\n&gt; I see that he is getting tired, but he is really *trying* to stay awake. We have also<br/>\n&gt; been talking about listening to your body and what it is trying to tell you. But he is fighting<br/>\n&gt; it...it is turning into a control thing ( which I usually try to avoid). Since I have been<br/>\n&gt; letting up on controlling him (we gave up tv and food controls about 2-3 months ago), control<br/>\n&gt;  seems to be more of an issue with him, if that makes any sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other problem I have is dh. He does not agree with my approach at all and thinks that I<br/>\n&gt; am being a doormat. He has absolutely no problem with expecting Jason to stay up in his<br/>\n&gt; room after a certain time. He wants to have time to watch his tv shows, relax and spend time<br/>\n&gt; with me. So I feel like I am trying to balance both dh&#39;s and Jason&#39;s needs and it is<br/>\n&gt; not happening.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am not dealing with this well and would appreciate all insight. Tonight I decided that since<br/>\n&gt; dh is away until Friday, I would try a new approach. We watched a little tv while I nursed<br/>\n&gt; Kyle to sleep. Jason then wanted to listen to the Wizard of Oz audio tape we got from the<br/>\n&gt; library. I told him that I had some cleaning to do, but when he was tired to let me know<br/>\n&gt; and I would go up and lay down with him (thinking that I could get some of my needs met<br/>\n&gt; to get something done and still meet his needs of not being alone when he goes to sleep). He<br/>\n&gt; said that he was tired around 10 but wanted to me to read to him. I said that it was<br/>\n&gt; too late for that (I really was tired, but looking back on it, it would not have killed<br/>\n&gt; me to read a chapter...I think that it was my way of still controlling the situation). We<br/>\n&gt; went up and laid down. He ended up getting fidgety, getting up for water etc etc etc. I<br/>\n&gt; ended up losing it. All I want is for him to go to sleep when he is tired!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is not the way that I want to end the day. But I am really struggling with giving<br/>\n&gt; up the control thing....I go back and forth between completely seeing his point of view<br/>\n&gt; (it sucks to know that my two favorite people are downstairs while I am stuck up here<br/>\n&gt; in this room) and completely feeling smothered and feeling like a couple of hours in<br/>\n&gt; the evening to myself is not too much to ask. Having him stay up late makes me feel<br/>\n&gt; very stressed for time...btween keeping up with the house, spending time with hubby,<br/>\n&gt; keeping up with my e-lists (which often keep me sane) and trying to find time to<br/>\n&gt; relax and read and now needing more sleep since Kyle is up so much, I am really going<br/>\n&gt; crazy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really need a new perspective here...but I feel like the more that I give up control,<br/>\n&gt; the more Jason pushes and pushes. How do I know when to draw the line? Is it ok to draw<br/>\n&gt; a line? I kind of feel like I have to draw a line or else I start getting resentful.<br/>\n&gt; Is this resentfulness something that I just need to adjust my attitude on or is<br/>\n&gt; it a sign that things need to come back into balance. And how do I get them back into<br/>\n&gt; balance if that is the case. I just feel like my personality would make it very easy<br/>\n&gt; to swing too far out of balance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am looking for a local gym, rec center or y around<br/>\n&gt; here that would have a program for the kids so I can take a yoga class and they can play<br/>\n&gt; and wear themselves out a bit. I am working on making connections in the hs community<br/>\n&gt; so that Jason can go to friend&#39;s houses for playdates (I had a great network made up of<br/>\n&gt; his friends but they are all in school during the day now). I am also working on getting<br/>\n&gt; our living room set up with a tv and comfy couches etc thinking that maybe if dh<br/>\n&gt; can watch his shows in the family room and Jason stays in the living room then maybe<br/>\n&gt; that will take some of the pressure off. Any other ideas? Any ideas<br/>\n&gt; for tiring an active 6 yo out? Any ideas for helping hubby not take this personally<br/>\n&gt; and realize that in 10 years this period of our lives will seem much shorter and less<br/>\n&gt; important then it does now? Any ideas for eeking out some time to get things done<br/>\n&gt; around the house (and please know that I am not expecting to keep the house spotless,<br/>\n&gt; but the clutter gets awful and I start going crazy).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know that I just need to make that shift in my attitude, but I am having a hard time<br/>\n&gt; doing it. I did it when he was little, but it is harder now that he is 6...I honestly<br/>\n&gt; thought that the bedtime thing would be solved by now. I just feel like I have screwed<br/>\n&gt; everything up somehow and turned it into a control issue without even meaning to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the frantic sound to this post...I am just feeling very exhausted. I need<br/>\n&gt; to go to bed now...Kyle will probably be up in a few hours....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stephanie E.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
