We are always pleased when our<br/>\nconsumers<br/>\ntake the time to share their thoughts with us.<br/>\nNow that there is a renewed interest in biotechnology by regulatory<br/>\nagencies<br/>\nand some consumer concern exists, we did not feel it appropriate to ask<br/>\nour growers to include bt crops in what they sell us.<br/>\nJust like other food companies, Frito-Lay relies on and supports the<br/>\nregulatory<br/>\nagencies charged with safeguarding our food supply when sourcing<br/>\ningredients<br/>\nfor our products. These agencies continue to report that genetically<br/>\nmodified<br/>\ningredients are perfectly safe.<br/>\nSince we are also a large buyer of agricultural commodities, and more<br/>\nthan a<br/>\nquarter of the North American crop is derived from biotechnology, just<br/>\nlike other food companies, we could have biotechnology ingredients in<br/>\nour products.<br/>\nThank you for taking the time to contact Frito-Lay. We hope this<br/>\ninformation<br/>\nis helpful.<br/>\nFrito-Lay Consumer Affairs<br/>\nReference #: CAFS-4GSU2M</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7148,"nextTopicId":7144}}
