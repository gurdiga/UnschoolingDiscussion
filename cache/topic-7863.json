I would just nod my head and tell<br/>\nher that&#39;s great honey.  It took me another week to realize that she<br/>\nactually was reading them.  I don&#39;t have any idea how she learned, but I<br/>\ndo know she did it herself I can&#39;t take any credit for it.  She did the<br/>\nsame with her math.  One day she just came up out of the blue and<br/>\nstarted asking me questions about dividing. I in all of my infinite<br/>\nwisdom told her we would need to look at multiplication first.  She then<br/>\ntold me she already knew how to multiply and showed me.  I not sure how<br/>\nthis happened, but am thrilled that it did.
