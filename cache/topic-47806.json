Iguanas are not simple to keep where you just stick them <br/>\nin a tank and feed them lettuce. And yes some people do this. Contrary to <br/>\npopular belief, if well kept and healthy, they get very large in spite of <br/>\nwhere they are kept. They should also not be kept in an aquarium unless it&#39;s <br/>\nlike a 50 gal one. They need room. And they can get to be 6 feet. And they <br/>\nalso shouldn&#39;t be fed lettuce, at least not a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do carry salmonella and one never knows if they have it or not. They <br/>\ncan shed the bacteria and so can have it and not at different times. That&#39;s <br/>\nwhy one should always consider they do have it. It&#39;s shed in their feces <br/>\nfrom their stomach. They can get minute amounts (of feces) on their <br/>\nenclosure or even on them and then you handle them and maybe touch your <br/>\nmouth and that&#39;s how you get it. It&#39;s like a food poisoning thing where you <br/>\nget pretty sick but it goes away. In infants and older or health compromised <br/>\npeople, it will cause more harm. After handling, hands should always be <br/>\nwashed.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat pets for people who like them and are ready to take the time to care <br/>\nfor them properly and have the room for them as they grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSurf the Web without missing calls!ï¿½Get MSN Broadband.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/freeactivation.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/freeactivation.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] iguanas","postDate":"1035495598","msgId":47808,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgxLjIzNzU3ZTEwLjJhZTljMmFlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47806,"nextInTopic":47884,"prevInTime":47807,"nextInTime":47809,"topicId":47806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/24/2002 4:57:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
