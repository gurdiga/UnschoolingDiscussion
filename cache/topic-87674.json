Big cardboard block are a favourite and the magna doodle, marble run and trucks. The Barbies and Bratz doll were pretty much a flop...appreciated but forgotten though South African Princess Barbie is vewed with some wonder and was promoted to African Queen since she looked so much more regal than all the other princess Barbies with their pink ruffles.

Work is finally back to normal and she has been getting home from there around 11:00. A nice change from the 1:00 a.m. time she was coming home. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph is so deep in Bionicles and Mega Bloks he can&#39;t see straight. I must admit I love them both. He seems to enjoy them so much more than the Lego stuff he asked for last year. He has been putting them all together himself so he&#39;s been very busy. His birthday is tomorrow and he has more Mega Bloks coming. He&#39;s into the dragon stuff. Joe also picked up a backgammon game which I had forgotten that Joseph was asking about. I&#39;m sure he enjoy playing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll 3 little ones have also been enjoying Cadoo. Even Alyssa can play with them with a little help. <br/>\n<br/>\nSierra is into her Care Bears. She likes the little ones on key chains. Barbie is also very big now too. She&#39;s starting to write also. My mom is showing her how. When Joseph, Joe and I came home yesterday, Sierra showed us a bunch of words she had written. She&#39;s doing names right now. I must say she&#39;s doing very well for never writing before. And my mom is enjoying &quot;teaching&quot; her. There&#39;s still a bit of school teacher in her after all these years. Luckily she&#39;s supportive of what we do and not pushy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlyssa is knee deep in My Little Pony stuff. It&#39;s everywhere!!! She was so into the holidays this year it was just too cute. Now she&#39;s asking when her birthday is!! Poor thing has to wait until Oct. With Joseph&#39;s now and SIerra&#39;s in a few weeks, she&#39;s wishing hers was here too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the scooters were a great gift. Joe is scouting for good places to ride and skate now that he&#39;s on wheels himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, the holidays were crappy but the aftermath is wonderful!!!!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87756,"nextTopicId":87784}}
