And furthermore, of course, you <br/>\nnever see a parent. Not that you&#39;d probably want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my main rule is that kids I don&#39;t like can&#39;t come in the house. My <br/>\nexcuse is, &quot;I just cleaned,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m getting ready to clean.&quot; Second, if <br/>\nanyone gets hurt, I just start telling the visitor (regretfully, as someone <br/>\nalready suggested) that they are too old to play with my kids. It can take a <br/>\ndozen times of saying this, as apologetically as possible, before they give <br/>\nup and quit coming over. If you are kind about it, I think they take you at <br/>\nyour word and don&#39;t get their feelings hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I hold my kids responsible for their own behavior. If they get in <br/>\ntrouble by &quot;following the crowd,&quot; then there are consequences. The fact that <br/>\nother people act like idiots is no excuse for them to do so. I think you can <br/>\ntell them, &quot;Yes, I know Johnny&#39;s family lets him wander the neighborhood <br/>\nalone, curse and play Nintendo all day. I&#39;m sorry but in our family, we <br/>\ndon&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve it or not, it works. I signed my ds up for a karate class when he <br/>\nwas 6. I soon discovered that many people consider karate to be a form of <br/>\ntherapy for little boys with discipline problems. I was worried my ds would <br/>\nget nothing out of the class, or worse, be corrupted. I was wrong. He was <br/>\nattentive despite the occasional ruckus around him and got a lot out of the <br/>\nclass.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8460,"nextTopicId":8461}}
