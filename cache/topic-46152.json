I recommend something warm, it may have been <br/>\n&gt; years since <br/>\n&gt; someone left something soft and fluffy for him to wrap up in. Of <br/>\n&gt; course the <br/>\n&gt; honey and maybe some nuts. An oatmeal cake would be nice too. <br/>\n&gt; Homemade bread <br/>\n&gt; and a bit of butter and/or cheese. Something shiny and new, he may <br/>\n&gt; not have <br/>\n&gt; had anything new, all his own, for a long time. A shiny brand new <br/>\n&gt; penny, or <br/>\n&gt; maybe a pretty bead? Do you know about those little tiny glass <br/>\n&gt; beads? (seed <br/>\n&gt; beads) Have Dylan make a small necklace out of some.
