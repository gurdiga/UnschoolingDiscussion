Finding ways to rephrase things in your own mind will help you see more clearly what your children are actually gaining from the activities they are choosing to participate in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour child likes to re-watch certain movies many times.  Likely every time brings a new experience, something gained, something learned.  Some of the things I could imagine a child gaining from watching things multiple times might be:<br/>\n<br/>\n*  Understanding the story line better.  Understanding the structure of story lines in general better.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  Familiarizing of songs, dancing, dialogue, sets, costume, and/or character and character development.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  For some people, memorization is very satisfying, and it gives a sense of accomplishment (and can be thrilling, even) to be able to recite lines from songs or dialogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  Watching anything repeatedly can be a valuable means to remembering information.  We understand that, but children are learning how useful that can be for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n*  Listening to dialogue expands vocabulary.  Knowing what dialogue is coming up next, helps the listener focus on the nuances of the dialogue and not just the words - body language, intonation, contrast between characters, moods.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  Some children like to watch things that are scary or dramatic or difficult in some way many times because each time allows them to have some predictability over what is coming up next, and a sense of accomplishment in facing known fears and dealing with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n*  It might also be true that between the time the video was watched the first time and the next, something else might have happened in the child&#39;s life, giving them a new context in which to view the video again.  A relevant model of the world can be built by making new connections between experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there might be something particularly interesting in the video.  That would be valuable for the parent to know, so that she could bring more of that interest into the child&#39;s world to explore.  That&#39;s why watching videos with the child whenever possible is such a valuable resource for building a rich and relevant learning environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: breakfast, lunch and tea and quite time and...","postDate":"1391281051","msgId":73398,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxjamcycit1Mm50aG9AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGxjaHUwMytkOGp0YXJAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGxjaDcxcisxZ2xlbzBjQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JPDA3MEZDREU2LTk0RUItNDkyRS05MTgzLTRDRjkzODVERUFEOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGxjaHUwMytkOGp0YXJAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73396,"nextInTopic":73399,"prevInTime":73397,"nextInTime":73399,"topicId":73384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What is there to learn from watching barbie movies over and over?

colored food and packages and enjoys eating those things but it is no \nlonger her sole sustenance.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>She also loves to sit in her bed or on the couch with her laptop ALL \nday.&nbsp; For the past several weeks the only time she has&nbsp;come out of her \nroom is to run to the bathroom.&nbsp; So I go in to touch base with her.&nbsp; I \nask if she&#39;s hungry several times a day and when the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; we come up \nwith something that sounds good to her and I bring it.&nbsp; Often she will then \nshow me what she&#39;s working on or tell me about what&#39;s going on in her skype \ncalls, etc.&nbsp; She recently experimented with staying up until 2am or later \nand the other day slept until 3pm.&nbsp; Now she&#39;s starting to choose to sleep \nand wake on a schedule more similar to the rest of the family.&nbsp; The point \nis - I don&#39;t worry about any of that.&nbsp; I remember moving out of my parents \nhouse as a young adult and experimenting with all those same things.&nbsp; It \nmakes me feel warm &amp; happy inside to know that she doesn&#39;t have to wait to \nexplore life, ideas, options, etc.&nbsp; She is exploring now and having a great \ntime in the safety and comfort of her own bedroom.&nbsp; I see her in there all \ncozy and happy and I am so glad for her to have that experience.&nbsp; I could \nsee it as &quot;oh my God, this little girl is so out of control&quot; but she \nisn&#39;t.&nbsp; She&#39;s just exploring.&nbsp; She is a happy, healthy, curious, \ninquisitive young lady and I think that&#39;s awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know \nthat&nbsp;once she does hits those young adult years she is going to be much \nmore prepared then her traditionally parented peers.&nbsp; </div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>So try to take a deep breath and relax.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your girls \nare&nbsp;learning, they are happy and they are safe.&nbsp; That&#39;s what is \nimportant.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; BTW - it used to be Barbie movies at our house \ntoo.&nbsp; Now we have transitioned to Family Guy, South Park, etc.&nbsp;so \nenjoy those Barbie movies for now!&nbsp; Once they start experimenting with \nswearing and racier TV shows, You Tube videos, etc.&nbsp;you will no doubt be \nchallenged again!&nbsp; Just remember that they are learning and experimenting - \nnot turning into juvenile delinquents!&nbsp; It is perfectly normal to be \ncurious about all facets of the world - even those that make Mom \nuncomfortable!</div>\n<div>-Cass</div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd

\nWhen do these things (high sugar foods and many many barbie movies in succession) become just another choice rather than being all-consuming?\n\nWhat is there to learn from watching barbie movies over and over?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] breakfast, lunch and tea and quite time and...","postDate":"1391217358","msgId":73388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA3MEZDREU2LTk0RUItNDkyRS05MTgzLTRDRjkzODVERUFEOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxjaDcxcisxZ2xlbzBjQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxjaDcxcisxZ2xlbzBjQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73387,"nextInTopic":73390,"prevInTime":73387,"nextInTime":73389,"topicId":73384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-where does one go when all of these anchor points in your day seem to fall to the bottom of the ocean and you re all drifting about in a great big stormy","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-375096501\"><html><head></head>-=-<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">where does one go when all of these &quot;anchor points&quot; in your day seem to fall to the bottom of the ocean and you&#39;re all drifting about in a great big stormy sea?-=-</span><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Choosing a less dramatic analogy would be MUCH better, right then.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Don&#39;t think of your life as a great big stormy sea.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Where do you go when you are safe at home with your children, you have enough food to create three or five meals a day, you have electricity, internet access, a book full of ideas of things to do with children, a discussion group where people will give you links to even MORE ideas, and you live where it&#39;s legal to keep your children home?</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">There are LOTS of things to think that will soothe you with images of plenty, of abundance, and of gratitude. &nbsp;You&#39;re safe at your home. &nbsp;Don&#39;t borrow a great bit stormy sea of trouble.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">If your day has been based on meal times rather than learning, it might be a good time for a change!</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Sandra</span></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] breakfast, lunch and tea and quite time and...","postDate":"1391217095","msgId":73387,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":true,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjExMS1XNjgyNUI1NjU5QjY5RUYyMkIyMkM4RkI3QTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGxjaDcxcisxZ2xlbzBjQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxjaDcxcisxZ2xlbzBjQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73384,"nextInTopic":73388,"prevInTime":73386,"nextInTime":73388,"topicId":73384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you take them food during the day, or just wait for them to come and ask or take something themselves?

I was prompted to come here after reading Sandra&#39;s words in her Big Book about not being guided by the clock. We have in a loose fashion, give or take an hour or so. But so often lately our girls (8 and 6) either just don&#39;t eat breakfast, or find something unhealthy which kind of ends up being breakfast by the fact that its in the morning (yesterday it was a chocolate freddo at 11 am :0). Lunch is very hit and miss and then they grab snacks of some description because mostly they refuse to come up for lunch when I have salad ready... and tea, well, it might be a couple of mouthfuls and that&#39;s it. We have never requested clean plate or any of that kind sort of thing. I do find this chaotic messiness of food consumption as challenging as their copious amounts of tv/ipod/computer watching as the fact that our eldest daughter hasn&#39;t beed to bed before 11 pm for weeks....<br><br><div>it feels like our life is unravelling and falling apart. where does one go when all of these &quot;anchor points&quot; in your day seem to fall to the bottom of the ocean and

I was prompted to come here after reading Sandra&#39;s words in her Big Book about not being guided by the clock. We have in a loose fashion, give or take an hour or so. But so often lately our girls (8 and 6) either just don&#39;t eat breakfast, or find something unhealthy which kind of ends up being breakfast by the fact that its in the morning (yesterday it was a chocolate freddo at 11 am :0). Lunch is very hit and miss and then they grab snacks of some description because mostly they refuse to come up for lunch when I have salad ready... and tea, well, it might be a couple of mouthfuls and that&#39;s it. We have never requested clean plate or any of that kind sort of thing. I do find this chaotic messiness of food consumption as challenging as their copious amounts of tv/ipod/computer watching as the fact that our eldest daughter hasn&#39;t beed to bed before 11 pm for weeks....<p></p><div>it feels like our life is unravelling and falling apart. where does one go when all of these &quot;anchor points&quot; in your day seem to fall to the bottom of the ocean and you&#39;re all drifting about in a great big stormy sea?</div><div><br></div><div>Kirsty</div></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73410,"nextTopicId":73427}}
