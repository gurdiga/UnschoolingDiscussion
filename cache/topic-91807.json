I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nread <br/>\nit straight through, though.   I would just pop it open and read a page here <br/>\nand there.   I still do it every once in awhile if I see the dictionary out.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s strange to see a word you have never heard. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe too.  Sometimes I have a hard time JUST looking something up in a <br/>\ndictionary or encyclopedia (or now on Google) because I get distracted by something on <br/>\nthe side, and then I look something else up because of that, or just start <br/>\nreading along and I forget why I went in there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE dictionaries with charts and colored pictures.  When I was a kid we <br/>\nhad a two-volume dictionary (as lots of people did in those days) and I just <br/>\nabout memorized every color plate.  Birds of North America.  Amphibians.  Holly <br/>\nbought a baby-names book the other day and I told her that when I was a kid I <br/>\nused to read the baby-names section of our big dictionary (same dictionary, <br/>\nseveral pages of boys&#39; names and girls&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the American Heritage Encyclopedic Dictionary.   The sad thing is they <br/>\ntook the etymologies out to put in color illustrations.   But the happy thing <br/>\nis I have the one with eymologies right next to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91797,"nextTopicId":91811}}
