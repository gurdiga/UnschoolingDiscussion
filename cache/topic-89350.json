That&#39;s the principle <br/>\nbehind all of this unschooling business.  If you tell them what theyhave to <br/>\nread/write/add and when and how, that becomes what they don&#39;t want to do.  They <br/>\nresent reading/writing/adding and they come to resent the person who is trying to <br/>\nforce it on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why it works with other things in life too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Do I give her more ways of helping whenever possible or just quit asking <br/>\nher for help of any kind? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of those involve being nicer to her or thanking her profusely.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is she getting out of living in the family?  Does she feel empowered and <br/>\nfree, or is she treated like a child (and a bad child)?<br/>\n<br/>\nI read Joyce&#39;s advice.   I agree with it as a thought, but I know it&#39;s <br/>\nfrustrating to need another pair of hands and someone standing right there, and not <br/>\nhelping.  But a balance would help.  If you get help in an emergency or with <br/>\nthe interesting part, that&#39;s probably all you should count on, and if you&#39;re <br/>\nthen resentful for not getting more, the person might not want to help in the <br/>\nnext emergency, or might not find your stuff very interesting afterward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a tall husband and two tall sons.  I&#39;m willing to get a chair and <br/>\nclimb up to get something off a top shelf if they&#39;re not home, but it&#39;s easier for <br/>\nme and safer if I ask for help.  But I wouldn&#39;t decide to empty and clean all <br/>\nthe high shelves, expecting their help, and getting grumpy if they weren&#39;t <br/>\nwilling to invest an hour of their life on short notice because I suddenly <br/>\nthought we really needed new shelf paper up high or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know sick chldren isn&#39;t something you thought up, but it&#39;s possible that a <br/>\nquiet mom would help them get better faster than a frustrated and furious mom. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a baby carrier?  A backpack?  Could you carry the baby while you <br/>\ntake care of the boys?   Can you nest up in one room and put on peaceful <br/>\nmovies and rub their heads or hold their hands until they fall asleep?   Quiet <br/>\nsleep is better for getting well than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople value physical things over mental and internal too often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPuke on the floor can be cleaned up.

You want the right kind of help right<br/>\nnow. But that type of reaction makes withdrawals from the relationship that<br/>\nyou pay for in the future: a child who is less willing to help because she<br/>\nfeels that what she can do is unappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe by this age she should be feeling compassion and wanting to jump in to<br/>\nhelp, but she&#39;s been set back because she feels what she can do isn&#39;t wanted<br/>\nor appreciated. Or maybe she&#39;s still in the development phase of not being<br/>\nable to see with compassion.

That&#39;s the principle <br/>\nbehind all of this unschooling business.  If you tell them what theyhave to <br/>\nread/write/add and when and how, that becomes what they don&#39;t want to do.

Does she feel empowered and <br/>\nfree, or is she treated like a child (and a bad child)?<br/>\n<br/>\nI read Joyce&#39;s advice.   I agree with it as a thought, but I know it&#39;s <br/>\nfrustrating to need another pair of hands and someone standing right there, and not <br/>\nhelping.  But a balance would help.  If you get help in an emergency or with <br/>\nthe interesting part, that&#39;s probably all you should count on, and if you&#39;re <br/>\nthen resentful for not getting more, the person might not want to help in the <br/>\nnext emergency, or might not find your stuff very interesting afterward.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a tall husband and two tall sons.  I&#39;m willing to get a chair and <br/>\nclimb up to get something off a top shelf if they&#39;re not home, but it&#39;s easier for <br/>\nme and safer if I ask for help.  But I wouldn&#39;t decide to empty and clean all <br/>\nthe high shelves, expecting their help, and getting grumpy if they weren&#39;t <br/>\nwilling to invest an hour of their life on short notice because I suddenly <br/>\nthought we really needed new shelf paper up high or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know sick chldren isn&#39;t something you thought up, but it&#39;s possible that a <br/>\nquiet mom would help them get better faster than a frustrated and furious mom. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a baby carrier?  A backpack?  Could you carry the baby while you <br/>\ntake care of the boys?   Can you nest up in one room and put on peaceful <br/>\nmovies and rub their heads or hold their hands until they fall asleep?   Quiet <br/>\nsleep is better for getting well than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople value physical things over mental and internal too often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPuke on the floor can be cleaned up.

It wouldn&#39;t me either.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou were upset because she didn&#39;t know the baby&#39;s hungry cry.  Did you know that cry from square one?  Maybe you did since you&#39;re the mom, but your daughter may not.  Your daughter may need to be given the chance to recognize the differences in the baby&#39;s signals, just like anyone else would.  And the baby may have gotten used to being walked around while sis is feeding her if you had given her the chance.  It may not be the way YOU do it, but for some reason, your daughter thought it was the right thing to do at the time.  Maybe she would have changed her mind and sat down eventually, or maybe the baby would have calmed down and gotten used to being carried, but you didn&#39;t give either of them the chance to adjust.  You got upset.  You made demands of your helper to do things your way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that this all happened in the heat of the moment, and I&#39;m not saying that any of it is easy.  It&#39;s not.  Sometimes it&#39;s impossibly hard, I know.  But it all comes down to choices, and instead of giving your daughter choices, you gave demands.

We&#39;ve always asked that the kids help out with things as they are able to, so that wasn&#39;t really needing to be changed. If they say no, for the most part it&#39;s not a big deal. However, if Paul is on duty, then Sarah especially needs to help me more...what needed to change there was for me to stop asking for &quot;help&quot; all the time with things I could really do myself. I&#39;ve done rather well with that...but when I ask her help she will NOT listen, and will do anything BUT what I&#39;ve asked her to do. I&#39;ve explained over and over that this is NOT being helpful to me at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor example, this past week Megan and Logan have both been very sick. Paul is on duty this week (he&#39;ll be home tomorrow thankfully!!) At the start of the week, when Paul went on duty I explained to Sarah that I was going to need her help with alot more things, because I&#39;d need to give so much attention to the Littles because they are so sick. <br/>\n <br/>\nI ask her to help me in very specific ways. IE: &quot;Sarah, Gracie is hungry. I need you to sit and hold Gracie and give her her bottle.&quot; (Logan is throwing up right then and I&#39;m trying to help him..this is what was just going on a few minutes ago) Instead of sitting and holding Gracie and feeding her, Sarah&#39;s up walking around with her! Gracie&#39;s screaming because this isn&#39;t what she is wanting!! I tell her &quot;Sarah, go sit down with her and feed her her bottle!&quot; and she says &quot;But she wants this (walking around).&quot; and I explain &quot;Sarah, she&#39;s screaming her head off, which means that is NOT what she&#39;s wanting!

Sit and feed her PLEASE!&quot; (Yes, at this point, while Logan is throwing up and I&#39;m trying to keep him calm and keep vomit from getting on the floor...I&#39;m getting angry at her). <br/>\n <br/>\nI can&#39;t seem to get it through her head (and she&#39;s done this for the past couple years now, by the way..the oppositional thing) that doing what SHE wants to do like that isn&#39;t helping me. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m thinking maybe I need to change my perspective on this..but I&#39;m not sure how! Do I give her more ways of helping whenever possible or just quit asking her for help of any kind? How do I handle things when there really is no other way for her to be helpful other than doing something very specific like feeding Gracie while I&#39;m helping Logan while he&#39;s throwing up? <br/>\n <br/>\nSIGH...I know there has got to be a better way than butting heads over &quot;helping.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
