Villifying the TV <br/>\nisn&#39;t right.  The TV isn&#39;t your problem.  The kids won&#39;t be watching TV if <br/>\nthey&#39;re not even in the house.  Get out and do something exhilarating.  Rent <br/>\nvideos you yourself would like to watch with them, if you can&#39;t get out.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Only you know your child well enough to recognize<br/>\nthe difference between a minor fixation and a truly problematic<br/>\naddiction.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut others might see options other than just turning the TV into a control <br/>\nissue between the parent and child, and there are LOTS of people on this list <br/>\nwho are successfully, happily and calmly unschooling.

Have on offer your normal life: day trips, general fun things,<br/>\nbut don&#39;t be rushing in there every time they sit down and try to get them<br/>\nto do something else. Treat their television viewing with the same respect<br/>\nyou would show if they were reading a book or playing a game or singing a<br/>\nsong -- wait until they&#39;re done before you offer other things, or offer<br/>\nother things only when they really DO come up naturally (&quot;I&#39;m starting<br/>\ndinner, anybody want to help?&quot; or &quot;Okay, gang, let&#39;s find a good stopping<br/>\npoint after this program so we can excavate the living room.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nheading out to the store when Dad gets home, anybody who wants to go with me<br/>\nneeds to have shoes on and hair brushed.&quot; Etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll wager real money that they will show you in that year (actually in a<br/>\nlot less than a year, most likely in the first week or two) a variety of<br/>\nviewing patterns, including watching TV nearly all day every day for days,<br/>\nand not watching more than a few minutes a day for days (but leaving the<br/>\ndarn thing on, which I always turn off if no one is in the room &lt;g&gt;) and<br/>\nwatching one full program here or there, or watching if they&#39;re bored or<br/>\nstressed, or any or all of the above and about 20 other patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is entertaining. This should come as no great shock to people -- it&#39;s why<br/>\nit&#39;s so popular. The reason it&#39;s the major pastime of Americans isn&#39;t<br/>\nbecause they mist heroine out the speakers at us, it&#39;s because it&#39;s fun to<br/>\nwatch. It&#39;s also information-intensive, educational, drivel, great, boring<br/>\nand stupid, brilliant, inspiring, irritating, all of the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family watches a LOT of TV, from &quot;the good stuff&quot; on the History and<br/>\nDiscovery Channels to such mindless drivel as my newest obsession, The<br/>\nAmazing Race on CBS Wednesdays (though I learned several interesting things<br/>\nabout South Africa last week &lt;g&gt;). In spite of this (or, as this unschooler<br/>\nwould say, because of this), we can converse in complete sentences, enjoy<br/>\nbooks and games and walks, and don&#39;t drool noticeably (well, maybe during<br/>\nSweeps &lt;eg&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24926,"nextTopicId":24861}}
