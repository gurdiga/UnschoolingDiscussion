I know that this runs in my family, so I <br/>\nam already trying to eliminate or at least greatly reduce refined sugars from <br/>\nmy kids&#39; diets, too.  With the western diet as it is, the authors of the Low <br/>\nBlood Sugar Handbook assert that the numbers of people who potentially have <br/>\nLBS is staggering.  The other book I have is from the library, called the <br/>\nHypoglycemia/Diabetic Cope Book, by Freda Whalen, CN, RMT.    Here is the <br/>\nlist from her book:  can&#39;t concentrate or make decisions, can&#39;t get started <br/>\nin the a.m., can&#39;t work well under pressure, consumes excessive <br/>\nalcohol,craves candy-soda-coffee in between meals,cry easily/feels like <br/>\ncrying inside,depressed, drinks more than 3 c of coffee/soda a day, eats <br/>\ncandy/cake or drinks soda daily, eats bread-pasta-potatoes-rice-beans, eats <br/>\nwhen nervous, eats w/o being hungry, fearful, feel insecure/low self <br/>\nimage,fits of anger,headaches, highly emotional.hungry between meals or at <br/>\nnight, insomnia/waking with inability to go back to sleep,lack of energy, <br/>\nmagnify insignificant details, moody, poor memory, reduced initiative, sleepy <br/>\nduring the day, drowsy after meals,tired most of time, worry frequently, <br/>\nallergies:asthma, hay fever skin rash, sinus trouble,bad dreams, bleeding <br/>\ngums, blurred vision, bored, bruise easily, cold hands/feet yr round, <br/>\nconvulsions, dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue relieved by eating, feel <br/>\nfaint if meal delayed, get shaky when hungry, hallucinations, having the need <br/>\nto sigh, heart palpitations, irritable before meals, muscle twitching/cramps, <br/>\nphobias, reduced sex drive, skin aches or itches, stomach cramps-&quot;nervous <br/>\nstomach&quot;, suicidal thoughts-feelings of hopelessness, sweating excessively, <br/>\ntrembling of hands, ulcers-gastritis-chronic indigestion-abdominal bloating, <br/>\nuncoordinated-dropping or bumping into things,unsocial/antisocial behavior.   <br/>\n Again, it is not that a person with LBS would  have every thing listed;and <br/>\nalso, most people have some of these from time to time.  It is just when <br/>\nthere are symptoms that persist over time and maybe also increase over time, <br/>\nthat it may indicate that the blood sugar is out of balance.  A blood sugar <br/>\ncondition like this affects the nervous sys. first, and that is why there are <br/>\nso many symptoms of that nature.  Eating a diet free from refined sugars <br/>\nhelps to stabilize the sugar, thus alleviating the symptoms.    Hope this <br/>\nhelps! :)       ~Karen in Ind</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"HPaulson5@aol.com","from":"HPaulson5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"14FR6TWtp8amizFowEUKec0UZh-VUq7lU6B1UJsCdP7IEBfdfGD0gnN7SBTCHnZBKAqVT5NhIkc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] hypoglycemia","postDate":"959358124","msgId":8670,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3LjViMjYyYmYuMjY1ZmZlYWNAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":8659,"nextInTopic":8672,"prevInTime":8669,"nextInTime":8671,"topicId":8630,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good luck to you, Dia!  ~Karen","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-43516660\">Good luck to you, Dia!  ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;kworthen@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"l7zEv8Eq1M4VxB73jXyYQghdZ9vRAK3MlgaU2SuaYs9NagP1u0uOH4q0BxgIn-8UrlNv2d1R79mx2GnvdH41VrNmGrA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] hypoglycemia","postDate":"959351622","msgId":8659,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWQwMWJmYzcxZiQ2NDU2ZmZjMCRkM2E0ODAxOEBuZS5tZWRpYW9uZS5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDRlLjYwYTFmM2MuMjY1ZjNmZmRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":8655,"nextInTopic":8670,"prevInTime":8658,"nextInTime":8660,"topicId":8630,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Karen, Thanks so much for taking the time to write this.

Can you explain to me why cooking without sugar helps <br/>\nyou?<br/>\n <br/>\n Nanci K.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote> Hi Nanci,  As you might already know, hypoglycemia  is  when a person has <br/>\nlow blood sugar.  When the blood sugar  is low, it can cause  many symptoms <br/>\nsuch as headaches, irritability, temper outbursts, fatigue, trouble sleeping, <br/>\nconstant hunger, digestive problems, inability to concentrate, bruising <br/>\neasily, abdominal bloating, mood swings, excessive worrying,  anxiety, <br/>\nnightmares, phobias, visual trouble, allergies, itchy skin, and  a need to <br/>\nsigh and yawn.   There are othersigns, too...  but this is off the top of my <br/>\nhead.  Not everyone will have all of the symptoms, and most everyone has some <br/>\nof these some of the time.  A person with LBS will have some or almost all of <br/>\nthe signs the majority of the time., not just once in a while.  Consuming <br/>\nthings with sugar in them aggrevates the condition and will likely  worsen <br/>\nthe symptoms over time.  Sugar causes the pancreas to pour more insulin in <br/>\nthe blood stream.  This is out of balance for a person with LBS, and it <br/>\ncauses a chemical reaction in the brain and body, which manifests itself in <br/>\nthese symptoms.  Omitting sugars, honey, molasses, white bread, and all white <br/>\nflour products gets the blood sugar level regulated, in conjunction with a <br/>\ndiet of complex carbohydrates, and protein.  I have  found that over the last <br/>\n5 weeks I am feeling so much better.  I did have some &quot;withdrawals&quot; at first <br/>\nfrom the lack of sugar, but it is getting better and better; mostly I am so <br/>\nglad to be feeling so much better and sleeping so much better!
