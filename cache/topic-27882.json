He would really like workbooks but is moving beyond that<br/>\nfinally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral things we have done to help alleviate his anxieties at different<br/>\ntimes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  do 4-H projects.  They are heavy on record keeping so he could see<br/>\nwriting skills, multiplication, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  have him do projects with the kids so he could see they weren&#39;t somehow<br/>\nsecretly stupid<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  lots of computer games, like math blasters and 4th Grade adventures,<br/>\nautomatically keep track of skills<br/>\n<br/>\n4. offer kids lots of hands-on stuff, like gardening, animal care and<br/>\nbreeding (we are currently drying carved apples to make puppets...next<br/>\nHalloween, we may dry them to make &quot;shrunken heads&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27851,"nextTopicId":27877}}
