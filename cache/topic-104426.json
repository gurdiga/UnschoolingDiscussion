KATIE...my natural born night owl, who can&#39;t get up <br/>\nbefore noon. RIIIIIGHT. And she was even up late last night, but <br/>\nstill somehow managed to get up when I stirred her at 9:00 am. We <br/>\nwere on the road by 9:30, met the group by 10, and were peering at <br/>\nwater birds through scopes, looking at bison on the hillsides, and <br/>\nsome antelope bounding through the tall yellow grasses in the <br/>\ndistance. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the interior of the island there is an old farm. It seems to be <br/>\nthe destination for scout troops and field trips, etc. It was our <br/>\nending point today, and while there we saw the nest where a barn owl <br/>\nresides. Didn&#39;t see him, but we did pick up owl pellets off the <br/>\nfloor. No one else seemed so interested in mine, which has the teeth <br/>\nand looks like ribs of, a vole most likely. It&#39;s in a ziploc on the <br/>\ntable, waiting for someone to get interested enough to pick it apart. <br/>\nOr not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe walked around the farm a bit, while our guide pointed out a tree <br/>\nfull of pine siskins and goldfinches, which made both Katie and me <br/>\nremember the thistle seed feeder we had on the back deck in Idaho, <br/>\nthat the siskins and goldfinches loved so much. The chickens also had <br/>\nus longing for our country place a bit. But the friendliness of the <br/>\npeople around us more than made up for the friends we left behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group went down towards the marsh on the edge of the farm, where <br/>\none experienced member of the group spotted an OWL! It was a male <br/>\nlong eared owl, and he had gone into &quot;camouflage&quot; mode, :pulling <br/>\nhimself up very tall and narrow, and holding extremely still. Usually <br/>\nan eared owl will set itself flush against the tree trunk and REALLY <br/>\ngo invisible, but this guy was out from the trunk a foot or so, and <br/>\nhe was amazing. That is the first owl I&#39;ve ever seen, though I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard many. His eyes were round and yellow with big black pupils, and <br/>\nhis feathers, through the viewing scope, looked so soft. Just Amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lunch, we went to the library, where Katie picked up a Star <br/>\nWars DVD about Episode III and many books on tape. We listened <br/>\nto &quot;Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher&quot; in the van on the way home. I <br/>\npicked up a half dozen books on Feng Shui.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhile us girls had been out &quot;amateur naturalist-ing&quot; the men of the <br/>\nfamily, and the Young Woman, had spent a lazy day watching TV and <br/>\nlounging in a nest of sleeping bags and blankets, or the couch, or <br/>\nthe easy chairs. <br/>\n<br/>\nright now, the two younger kids are digging a hole in the side yard, <br/>\nand sifting dirt and rocks through my yellow one-handed noodle <br/>\nstrainer, oldest daughter is at the theatre being a Servant Girl <br/>\nExtra, and hubby is watching something on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to see what the little diggers have unearthed.<br/>\n<br/>\nbye!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi who saw an OWL today!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104185,"nextTopicId":104408}}
