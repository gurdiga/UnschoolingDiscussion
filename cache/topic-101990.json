When I was 6, I was very advanced in &quot;reading&quot; and pretty good in &quot;math&quot;.  My first grade teacher said to my mom &quot;I can&#39;t teach her anything&quot;, which my mom thought was a bit silly, as the teacher was a grown woman and actually knew tons of stuff that I didn&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know how to look stuff up using Google, or are willing to learn, you can be very helpful to your son, even as he grows and leaves you behind in some areas.  And lots of us have found that it is really fun to learn stuff about &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science&quot; and how the world works that we didn&#39;t grasp when we were kids.  It can actually be surprisingly enjoyable.  If you have some research skills, and know how to get to the local library &lt;g&gt; and to find people around you who have skills that you don&#39;t, you really are good to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaring about your child and about meeting his needs, and being flexible in your approach are the big advantages of homeschooling over formal schooling in an institution.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Four questions","postDate":"1104553513","msgId":101997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyNThuOStocDNrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTE5LUYyNTNDQ0U4NDFEQzBDOTIxRkVDRUY2QjI5RTBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":101993,"nextInTopic":102000,"prevInTime":101996,"nextInTime":101998,"topicId":101990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Seriously. I think just about anything anyone needs or wants <br/>\nto know can be found somewhere on the internet. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the important thing about unschooling is not &quot;staying one <br/>\nstep ahead&quot; of your child, or knowing the answer to every possible <br/>\nquestion he may have, but rather helping him find those answers for <br/>\nhimself, with as much or as little assistance from you as he <br/>\ndesires. I also think that with those &quot;unschooling tools&quot; in your <br/>\ntoolbox, you can help him gain a more authentic learning experience, <br/>\nby that i mean if he is interested in say, astronomy, he may find it <br/>\nmore interesting to talk to a real astronomer, go to a planetarium <br/>\nas much as he pleases (rather than crammed into a school field <br/>\ntrip), get out the telescope and look at the real stars, instead of <br/>\njust reading about it in a textbook. YOU dont have to be the expert, <br/>\njust help him find the info he needs to satisfy what it is he is <br/>\ntrying to learn about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have no doubt I can raise a man!

I bet there is a fair amount of people with advanced <br/>\ndegrees who wouldnt feel qualified to be the *only* source for a <br/>\nchild&#39;s education. But luckily, with unschooling, you dont have <br/>\nto &quot;teach&quot; your son, and you don&#39;t have to be his only resource. <br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":208063396,"authorName":"laurie c","from":"&quot;laurie c&quot; &lt;pmocl@...&gt;","profile":"lac010774","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Four questions","postDate":"1104548018","msgId":101993,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTE5LUYyNTNDQ0U4NDFEQzBDOTIxRkVDRUY2QjI5RTBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkOS4zMzNlM2Q4OC4yZjA3NjU2MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101990,"nextInTopic":101997,"prevInTime":101992,"nextInTime":101994,"topicId":101990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe what I really need to know is..... well, how do I know!
