I use Sevin dust on the beans when<br/>\nthey are young, otherwise the beetles eat them up.  By the time they have<br/>\nsome size to them the beetles can&#39;t do much damage.  We spray weed killer<br/>\naround the outside of the garden area because there are weed abatement laws<br/>\nhere and there really is no other way to keep the weeds down in an area of<br/>\nthis size.  We keep a border fo about 10 feet between the sprayed area and<br/>\nthe garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the winter we take all of the yucky hay, cow pies, and nanny berries<br/>\nout to the garden area, and in the spring my husband disks it all in.  When<br/>\nthe garden is growing we take old hay and put it around plants and in<br/>\nwalkways for the nutrients to leach into the ground.  Lots of natural<br/>\nfertilizer!<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I did have to water the tomatoes and melon twice as we had a long<br/>\ndry spell, but that is unusual.  So far no watering and all is doing well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"David Albert","from":"David Albert &lt;shantinik@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jBscTL7s4P0lMCloDIGyLK-CssyIFMFp67dqIGEUhvJegtVUxkPcTB_3B9E_Mx9DcwRTa2WeuCM1NLWc7674G9KeM8mScwewAc_Uf3A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] gardens","postDate":"961809663","msgId":9742,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NTQwQ0ZGLkY3RjMxNUM5QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDExLjU3ZGMyOTMuMjY4NTVkNWJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":9736,"nextInTopic":9745,"prevInTime":9741,"nextInTime":9743,"topicId":9696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, I know this one -- you bought the sweet millions and didn t believe them!!
