How could anyone have planned for her future--from horses and buggies and candlelight to jet airplanes and computer and space travel. Her future, from her point of view, was surviving. And raising a family and doing good in the world.<br/>\nAt 14 she came to this country not knowing the language. she learned the spoken language and to read enough to get along--although today they&#39;d call her illiterate and would intervene.  She helped to support her family when she was 15. Lived through 2 world wars and a whole lot of conflicts. She was kind and wise.  She knew how to find out what she needed to know or to ask others for help.<br/>\n We have no way to conceive of what the future holds.I truly believe in my heart of hearts that we or our children don&#39;t need to know all the answers but how to find out what we need to know and to surround ourselves with people who can support us in this thing called life.<br/>\n Debra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28601,"nextTopicId":28717}}
