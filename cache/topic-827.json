The hope was that the children would grow to bebig,strong,<br/>\n&gt;  and well-nourished so they could live productive lives and bea creditto<br/>\n&gt;  the town. The bread was provided for the children by means ofacommunity<br/>\n&gt;  tax and was distributed on a regular basis to all communitychildren<br/>\n&gt;  irrespective of size, shape, or color.<br/>\n&gt;  In this town there lived a woman named Matilda, who had threechildren.<br/>\n&gt;  She had given the matter some thought and had done somereading andhad<br/>\n&gt;  concluded that she could provide better nourishment for herchildrenby<br/>\n&gt;  making her own whole-wheat or even white bread. After furtherthoughtshe<br/>\n&gt;  decided she would try it out. Now, Matilda was aware that whatshe was<br/>\n&gt;  doing was decidedly &quot;odd&quot; and that she might get some flakfrom her<br/>\n&gt;  neighbors. She was, however, determined to provide what sheviewed asbest<br/>\n&gt;  for her children.<br/>\n&gt;  She began to make her own bread and no longer used the BreadDistribution<br/>\n&gt;  Service. She continued to pay the community tax for bread;and, in<br/>\n&gt;  addition, bought ingredients for her own homemade bread.Sometimeswhen<br/>\n&gt;  Matilda and her children were seen in public during the BreadDistribution<br/>\n&gt;  Hour, people would ask her, &quot;Why aren&#39;t your children eating?&quot;Shetried<br/>\n&gt;  to explain that she made bread for them and that they ate itwith the<br/>\n&gt;  family, but found that most people thought that was illegal.She beginto<br/>\n&gt;  fear that people would think her children weren&#39;t being fed(thoughthey<br/>\n&gt;  looked well-nourished) and that the City Fathers would thinkshe wasan<br/>\n&gt;  abusive parent. She began closing the windows on baking day sothearoma<br/>\n&gt;  wouldn&#39;t get out of the house and having the children eattheir bread<br/>\n&gt;  during the Bread Distribution Hour so they wouldn&#39;t beconspicuous.She<br/>\n&gt;  tried to keep a low profile to avoid detection.<br/>\n&gt;  However, rumor that there were some families making their ownbread<br/>\n&gt;  reached the offices of the City Fathers. The City Fathersdecided alaw<br/>\n&gt;  needed to be passed to deal with the situation and define whatwaslegal<br/>\n&gt;  There arose a great debate. Some said it was basically theparents&#39;<br/>\n&gt;  responsibility and privilege to provide bread for theirchildren.Others<br/>\n&gt;  said parents didn&#39;t know how to make bread and it should bemandatorythat<br/>\n&gt;  they obtain bread from the Bread Distribution Service.
