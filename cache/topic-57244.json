Although he has a hard time when a main character dies,  so don&#39;t know about Braveheart,  thinking on that one.<br/>\n <br/>\nIts so difficult because I see these things that I think he would really enjoy and then it turns into my agenda and about me.    Even tho&#39; I think I&#39;m doing it for him.  So there is a fine line between being some sort of a  facilitator/showing him what is out there to being controlling.    Finding that line and staying to the side that will allow him to follow his passions is what I am really attempting to do right now.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI also need to accept that he might not enjoy the same things that I enjoy.   <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess sometimes I sit and think about all the hurdles I still have to conquer and its hard to see that I have made some progress toward our unschooling goals.

In fact, I didn&#39;t have a high <br/>\nschool diploma either (I left high school early because it was such a <br/>\nwaste of time). I had to take many of the math classes concurrently <br/>\nwith the CIS classes, and there were many times when I registered for <br/>\na class without having had the math pre-reqs, and just figured it out <br/>\nas I went along, borrowing textbooks and such. A couple of times, it <br/>\ncaught me and I had to do some real scrambling to catch up, but all <br/>\nin all when you want/need to know something, you can find a way to do <br/>\nit. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout even knowing about this thread, the other morning Keith told me a <br/>\nstory about him I had never heard.  That happens pretty rarely, with two <br/>\ntalkative people after 25 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe said when he first went to college, they had him take math placement <br/>\ntests.  The first set was four pages, one page each of easy arithmetic, <br/>\nbusiness math, geometry and algebra, I think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe whipped through it in about 20 minutes.  The proctor looked, and sent him <br/>\nover to another room.  There they gave him a similar set, with calculus, <br/>\ntrigononmetry, and something he didn&#39;t understand at all--had never seen the <br/>\nsymbols ever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said they told him he could start at the junior level of calculus, <br/>\nskipping the first two years.  He didn&#39;t want to, not just on the basis of a <br/>\nfew sample questions.  So he took calculus, and ended up taking theoretical <br/>\nstuff for fun, and no math he ever had in college was hard for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s because no math he ever had in high school was hard for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s because no math anyone ever talked to haster Mind, pattern and <br/>\ndeduction stuff.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith said he always thought in patterns, and saw patterns in all kinds of <br/>\nthings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo nobody &quot;taught him math.&quot;  That&#39;s kind of his native brain-language.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople did show him cool tricks and teach him formal notation, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57515,"nextTopicId":57252}}
