We have one <br/>\nhen that hatched 9 chicks in the new extension built onto the side <br/>\nof the house, she found some insulation on a table in there <br/>\namongst other building materials and made her nest, one other hen <br/>\nshared the nest for a few days so was able to get two of  her <br/>\nbabies hatched by another hen.   It&#39;s great watching a mother hen <br/>\nwith her little ones, they are so fierce, our&#39;s even chases off the <br/>\ngeese and turkeys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Porsche Boxter.

My oldest e-mails with her grandma (using &quot;kid spelling&quot;). I read<br/>\nto them a ton of children&#39;s books and are halfway through the Little House<br/>\nseries. They play outside a lot and have taken to frog and worm hunting a<br/>\nlot lately and observing frogs swim in our bathtub: ) My five-year-old has<br/>\nher own little business selling eggs and my four-year-old sells fruit and<br/>\njam that she helps me make. My three-year-old son is a dinosaur fanatic and<br/>\nasks a lot of questions about them. Yesterday, he announced &quot;Mama, when I<br/>\ngrow up, I&#39;m going to be a pro bull rider.&quot; Yikes! The girls and I are<br/>\nexperimenting with sewing, cross stitch, latch hook, and crochet. We live<br/>\non 11 acres in Arkansas with a catfish pond, a hay meadow, and lots of<br/>\nfruit trees. My kids have learned things about animals, farming, and<br/>\ngardening that I didn&#39;t know at age 20. <br/>\nWe have a setting hen and I could swear she&#39;s been setting for 3 weeks.<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that the incubation period?
