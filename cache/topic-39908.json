Some of the ladies are down right scary! Libraries are places <br/>\nto BE QUIET!  I even witnessed one librarian(the one in charge of the <br/>\nchildrens programs for some odd reason) severely shushing and shaming <br/>\nkids at a program where there was a magician.  He was encouraging the <br/>\nkids to answer his questions and participate with him.<br/>\nThis lady was a watch dog waiting for these kids to actually enjoy <br/>\nthemselves.  She made a spectacle of herself, all the while thinking <br/>\nshe was doing a good job controlling these kids.<br/>\nI went to a library near my parents and was thrilled when I found the <br/>\nkids section downstairs away form all those noise fearing adults.  We <br/>\nhad a great time, and the librarian was friendly and obviously liked <br/>\nkids.  We stayed for hours watching vidoes on a big screen tv, <br/>\nplaying computer games and ofcoarse, reading books.  We came back a <br/>\nfew days later because the experience was so much nicer than the ones <br/>\nwe get from our libraries in our area.  Unfortuately, there was a <br/>\ndifferent librarian on duty and it was the same old feelings of <br/>\nwalking on ice and getting out of there quickly and quietly. <br/>\nMy kids know library etiquette, and are usually in good form when we <br/>\ngo, but we can&#39;t stay long and we rarely feel welcome.<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 2194","postDate":"1028605328","msgId":39913,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFpbmdpZysycmQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5NzRCNTY2LjExQTIlbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":39908,"nextInTopic":39937,"prevInTime":39912,"nextInTime":39914,"topicId":39908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good article. :) Of course I have to mention that not all librarians are friendly.

In fact, here&#39;s an article I wrote last year on just this<br/>\nidea....<br/>\n<br/>\nLibrary as School<br/>\nby Ned Vare<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago, John Holt talked about the difference between libraries and<br/>\npublic schools -- both government-run. He described the difference as<br/>\nlargely centered on the attitude of the employees. In libraries, the<br/>\nattitude is ALWAYS, &quot;How can I help you?&quot; There is an understanding that the<br/>\npatron is seeking information, and the purpose of the employee is to help<br/>\nthe patron find it. No questions asked. No mention of the patron being too<br/>\nyoung or not being dressed properly; no discussion about the appropriateness<br/>\nof the information or the &quot;readiness&quot; of the patron to learn it; no mention<br/>\nof testing or judging, no timetables, no hall passes, no arbitrary rules, no<br/>\nneed to ask permission to go pee. The library attitude is benevolence and<br/>\nservice.<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic schools, of course, do all those impertinent things, and worse. Their<br/>\nattitude is, &quot;Sit down and shut up, What can you do that I can judge? How<br/>\ncan I impose my will on you? How can I control your life? How can you fit<br/>\ninto OUR plan?² This may not be the attitude of every employee, but it is<br/>\ndefinitely the attitude of the institution and its unions, and that&#39;s what<br/>\nmatters.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a public school to be more like a library would mean big changes, such<br/>\nas: eliminate curriculula; eliminate groupings based on age, eliminate<br/>\ngrading, scoring, testing, sorting of patrons; eliminate most rules,<br/>\nschedules, timetables; eliminate certification of teachers (let anyone who<br/>\ncan, teach -- it&#39;s the learner&#39;s choice) and keep only teachers whose<br/>\nservices are in demand by patrons; eliminate most administrators and other<br/>\nnon-teaching personnel such as psychologists, &quot;deans,&quot; coordinators,<br/>\nlunchroom monitors, police guards, and therapists. Let sports be handled by<br/>\nanother organization, and paid for by its patrons.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, whether they&#39;re homeschooling or not, children are welcome at<br/>\npublic libraries, where they learn how to use the catalog, the<br/>\ncomputers, the restroom, the services of the friendly respectful<br/>\ncourteous employees and, smiling happily, go about their learning in their<br/>\nown ways. What would turn such a facility into a &quot;school&quot; would simply be to<br/>\nhave teacher/guides available to offer the public of all ages their services<br/>\nas facilitators in whatever areas of interest the patrons choose.
