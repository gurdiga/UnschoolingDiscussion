JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nControlling, a simple word for so much that it encompasses huh?  I&#39;ve been <br/>\nstruggling with this word all week and wondering WHY parents allow something <br/>\nlike a school system to control them and ultimately control their child?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very REAL question that I wish I had an answer to.  Why would <br/>\nparents do something they KNOW is detrimental to their precious child just because <br/>\na school system told them to?  Are they that willing to give over the &quot;power&quot; <br/>\nof parenting?  Are they afraid if the kid turns out &quot;wrong&quot; they&#39;ll have no <br/>\none but themselves to blame if they DON&#39;T do what the school tells them?  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know, but it seems crazy to me that so many just without questioning do <br/>\nexactly what someone inside a building (that WE as taxpayers pay for) tells them <br/>\nto do regarding their children and many of them are unwavering, EVEN if they <br/>\nfeel it&#39;s wrong, they go ahead and do it.  WHY?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand it.  I can&#39;t even slightly grasp why someone feels people, <br/>\njust people have some extra keen perception regarding THEIR children that <br/>\nthey cannot posses so therefore they must do what these people tell them.  Maybe <br/>\nbecause they&#39;ve been to school to LEARN about children?  Lord have mercy, <br/>\ndon&#39;t you learn about your own children every moment of every day?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I just don&#39;t understand control on any level.  I&#39;ve lived it for sure, <br/>\nwhen I was a child/young adult.  But I just don&#39;t see the need for it and why <br/>\nothers so willing turn it over, especially regarding their very own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m not going to &quot;control&quot; what my child see/does/is then why should I <br/>\nallow someone else to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think school need to be somehow reduced to what they actually are.  I think <br/>\ntoo many people think of them as this mysterious or wondrous building were if <br/>\nyou and your child do everything they tell you spit out great and wondrous <br/>\nhuman beings.  What about those that come out that they say aren&#39;t so great and <br/>\nwondrous?  Hmmm... guess they had problems school couldn&#39;t FIX?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool seems so very wrong to me, especially this week.  I do recognize that <br/>\nsome kids are better off in school, I was one of them.  But there are so many <br/>\nbright and wonderful spirits being crushed inside those buildings and the <br/>\npeople in those buildings are blaming those bright and wonderful spirits and the <br/>\nparents believe it is the children&#39;s fault...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, why would parents hand over complete control of their children to a <br/>\ngovernment agency for that many hours per day?  I&#39;m not just saying for education, <br/>\nthey are in COMPLETE control.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90789,"nextTopicId":90696}}
