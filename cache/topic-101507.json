I started homeschooling a little over a year<br/>\nago and started out unschooling.  I occassionaly &quot;lose faith&quot; as they<br/>\nsay, so much so that I bought a Calvert curriculum this year.  But I<br/>\nam happy to say that my kids let me know pretty fast that they prefer<br/>\nunschooling.  (Thank goodness for E-bay!)  Anyway, the words above<br/>\nreally hit home with me as I have totally created this situation with<br/>\nmy son.  My son feels totally guilty about the games and cartoons he<br/>\nloves.  He goes to his father&#39;s house on weekends and they really<br/>\nenjoy these activities together.  Sometimes my son will not tell me<br/>\nabout a game he has played or movie he has seen that he thinks I might<br/>\nnot like.  Then he will have a total break-down of guilt.  Any ideas<br/>\non how to mend my evil ways?  He&#39;s 7 years old.  He&#39;s a great kid and<br/>\nhe has a great father.  I really never meant to create this<br/>\natmosphere.
