The ER docs wanted her to give him oral<br/>\nantibiotics and topical ones, despite all the warnings in general against<br/>\nprophylactic antibiotics *especially* in the case of viruses.  She decided<br/>\nto give him the eye drops only for the specific secondary infection.  When<br/>\nshe followed up with her regular family doc, the doc was very distressed to<br/>\nhear about the ER recommendations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t specifically site the source here, but it must have been<br/>\nthinktwice.com or a vax book borrowed from a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read that many of the complications from pox have either to do with<br/>\nan already immune compromised child, kids having close contact while<br/>\nactively ill (once they break out, have them get their own space rather than<br/>\nco-sleeping or hanging on the couch together all day) and parents freaking<br/>\nout about fevers, going to ER and getting antibiotics before knowing hat the<br/>\nproblem is...making the virus worse?  Obviously I am posting this as a<br/>\njumping off point for some info to dig for and research.  I read it all over<br/>\n2 1/2 years ago when deciding to expose my kids, and I felt comfortable<br/>\ndoing it after my research.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHeather, mom to<br/>\nHarriet 12.15.99<br/>\nCrispin 01.25.02<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherette@...\">heatherette@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96773,"nextTopicId":48970}}
