This virus simply destroys Sector Zero from the hard<br/>\ndisk, where vital information for its functioning are stored.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThis virus acts in the following manner: It sends itself automatically to<br/>\nall contacts on your list with the title &quot;A Virtual Card for You.&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs soon as the supposed virtual card is opened, the computer freezes so that<br/>\nthe user has to reboot. When the ctrl+alt+del keys or the reset button are<br/>\npressed, the virus destroys Sector Zero, thus permanently destroying the<br/>\nhard disk.\r<br/>\nYesterday in just a few hours this virus caused panic in New York,according<br/>\nto news broadcast by CNN. This alert was received by an employee of<br/>\nMicrosoft itself. So don&#39;t open any mails with subject:&quot;A Virtual Card for<br/>\nYou.&quot;\r<br/>\nAs soon as you get this mail, delete it.
