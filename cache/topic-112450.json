I spoke with many of you on the Unschoolers Discussion list last year as I was <br/>\ndeveloping my documentary film about homeschooling, which ultimately focused <br/>\nexclusively on unschooling. I&#39;m pleased to report that the film, called &quot;Unschooled,&quot; had its <br/>\nWorld Premier earlier this week at the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in Missoula, <br/>\nMontana, which was a great success.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you&#39;re in the Bay Area and you still haven&#39;t seen Unschooled--or haven&#39;t seen it on the <br/>\nbig screen--now&#39;s your chance. I&#39;d like to invite you to join me at a screening next week in <br/>\nBerkeley.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooled has been selected to screen at the prestigious Pacific Film Archive (PFA) in <br/>\nBerkeley next Thursday, March 2nd, as part of the PFA&#39;s Real Live series. It will screen <br/>\nalong with a few other short films by current and former Berkeley students. The program <br/>\nstarts at 7:30, and I&#39;ll be there afterwards for a Q&A.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe PFA is at 2575 Bancroft Way, between College and Telegraph Ave. For directions, <br/>\nplease visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/visiting_bampfa/index.html.\">http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/visiting_bampfa/index.html.</a> The full <br/>\nprogram of that evening&#39;s screenings is at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/\">http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/</a><br/>\npfa_programs/2006reallive/index.html .<br/>\n <br/>\nOnce again, the screening info is:<br/>\n <br/>\n7:30pm on Thursday, March 2nd at the Pacific Film Archive (2575 Bancroft Way)<br/>\n <br/>\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the film, Unschooled is a 25-minute documentary that <br/>\nprofiles three unschooling families. In exploring the motivations and experiences of these <br/>\nfamilies, the film raises a question vital to schooled and unschooled viewers alike: What <br/>\ndoes it mean to be well-educated?<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m excited to screen the film in Berkeley and hope you can join me on March 2nd. If you <br/>\nhave any questions about the film or the screening, you can reach me at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jason@...\">Jason@...</a>. I&#39;d be happy to update you on future developments, including <br/>\nscreenings in other areas and how to purchase a copy of the film. <br/>\n <br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\nJason Marsh<br/>\nProducer/Director, UNSCHOOLED<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jason@...\">Jason@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112398,"nextTopicId":112453}}
