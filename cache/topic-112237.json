I simply don&#39;t require it of my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally, there are some shops where it wouldn&#39;t be approriate to be<br/>\nbare-foot- but I have found that if I say where we are going, Josh<br/>\ninstinctively realises it will be a place he should wear shoes.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to make a scene about it.  There are natural boundaries around, I<br/>\njust try not to create new ones for my children to follow.<br/>\n<br/>\nShell (in New Zealand)<br/>\nDS (7) and DD (3)<br/>\n<br/>\n Honestly...what is the issue with not wearing shoes?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the United States, there are signs on many many stores that say, &quot;No<br/>\nShirt, No Shoes, No Service&quot;.  If you go into a store (and are walking,<br/>\nnot in a stroller or wheelchair, etc.), then you need to be wearing<br/>\nshoes or you will most likely be kicked out of the store.  It isn&#39;t a<br/>\nparent rule, but rather a store rule and general society custom.  Same<br/>\ngoes with shirts.  I&#39;ve actually seen this happen, so it isn&#39;t just a<br/>\nmyth.
