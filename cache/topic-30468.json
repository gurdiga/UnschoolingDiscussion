She often said &quot;you&#39;re a child only once and<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll have your whole life to work&quot;.     Where I think she went wrong<br/>\n&gt; was she did all her housework while we were in school.  I hardly ever<br/>\n&gt; remember SEEING her clean.  I&#39;d SEE her make dinner (and she&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; wonderful trained chef), so I learned a lot about cooking just by<br/>\n&gt; watching her.  My mother wasn&#39;t the best housekeeper, but at least she<br/>\n&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t have cobwebs hanging from the ceiling like I do.<br/>\n&gt; ================<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This is fine if the mother doesn&#39;t mind doing all the work .  I think <br/>\n&gt; it was especially good that your mother gave you an understanding of <br/>\n&gt; why you were not helping out.  A few of my relatives do not ask their <br/>\n&gt; children to do anything.  These children are very poor house guests.  <br/>\n&gt; One 9 year old boy, when asked by his 70 year old grandmother if he <br/>\n&gt; could possibly get something for her, said &quot;why don&#39;t you get it&quot;.  <br/>\n&gt; Also when children come over to our house to play, my kids ask them to <br/>\n&gt; help clean up before they leave, some are very resistant because they <br/>\n&gt; do not think it is their responsibility or they just don&#39;t know what to <br/>\n&gt; do.  You mentioned that your children are very helpful so it does not <br/>\n&gt; sound like it is a problem at your house.  I wonder what the difference <br/>\n&gt; is with my relative?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pat<br/>\n&gt; ==================<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Pat,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, sometimes I do feel like I&#39;m doing all the work, but there are also <br/>\nthose times when my boys voluntarily, and on their own initiative, help <br/>\nme out.  I feel very rewarded when they do this.  In a way, I feel <br/>\nguilty about feeling this way.  I haven&#39;t yet figured out why. Maybe <br/>\nsomeone can explain it to me.  I don&#39;t assign chores because that seems <br/>\nto force the issue on the boys.  I would like it to come from inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 3 years ago, one of my sons said to me:  &quot;Why don&#39;t you get it <br/>\nyourself!&quot;  I knew immediately why he said it - because I had said that <br/>\nto him the day before.  It sounded awful when that came out of his mouth <br/>\nand probably just as bad as when it came out of mine.  Ever since that <br/>\nday, I try and fulfill as many of my boys&#39; requests as possible, if I&#39;m <br/>\nable to.  I see it as an opportunity to model for them.  As a <br/>\nconsequence, they gladly do things for me.  We are continually asking <br/>\nthings of each other.  They will gladly do something for me because they <br/>\nknow I will gladly do things for them.  It&#39;s a matter of me showing them <br/>\nthe respect that they show me and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are only 7 years old and continuously playing at one thing or <br/>\nanother.  So, they certainly don&#39;t help me with everything and I don&#39;t <br/>\nexpect them to.  But, when they ask to do something, I always say yes, <br/>\neven if I know they&#39;re going to make a big mess or if I know it&#39;ll take <br/>\nme 1/10th the time it&#39;ll take them to complete the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, Leroy went to play with his friend 3 doors down.  I walked down <br/>\nto check his blood sugar and see how he was doing.  I was very <br/>\nembarrassed when I walked into their very tidy and clean house to see <br/>\nthere laying, in the middle of their floor, Leroy&#39;s hat and coat.  I <br/>\nimmediately asked him to pick them up and put them on the couch, which <br/>\nhe did.  This was definitely a result of poor modeling on my part.  I&#39;m <br/>\nterrible about hanging my clothes up at night.  I&#39;m usually so tired, I <br/>\nusually just strip them all off and let them sit on the floor until <br/>\nabout mid-morning the next day, when I do the laundry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of us in this family, are very, very far from perfect.  But, I think <br/>\nwe are definitely moving in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       Yahoo!

I think the key is respect.  You&#39;re +not+ doing everything for your kids, they respect your time and they earn self-respect by taking care of their things and helping out.  You may not call the things that are done in your house chores but your kids help out and that is all that is important.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve given a lot of thought to what you and the others have been telling me over the past few days and we have made some changes around here.  I will no longer be in charge of bed time.  They know when they are tired and will go to bed if given control.  The reason we started a bed time routine was to encourage time for quiet reading.  When I discussed this with the girls today, my older one said she can&#39;t go to sleep unless she has her reading time so she will always fit that in.  My younger one said she can&#39;t read at night because she is usually too tired.  She said she would rather read in the morning.  My husband was afraid they would stay up too late and keep us awake.  We agreed that we were to respect each others need to go to bed at different times.  I will continue to think about what areas I may still be trying to control things and give that up, thanks for sharing your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, January 01, 2002 6:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] chores/routines WAS: grandparents<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tue, 1 Jan 2002 18:06:13 -0500, Pat Cald... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is fine if the mother doesn&#39;t mind doing all the work .

One way is to share in the work load so there is more time for everyone to spend together.  The other way is to learn life skills.  We have a long list of things that the girls should need to learn by the time they leave the house.  They include things like checking air pressure in car tires and other household maintenance items that they will need to know.  So other than taking care of their own things - bedroom, animals, etc. they choose a chore that they would like to learn and then do that chore for a few weeks until they feel they have mastered it.  They then choose another chore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!

Don&#39;t you <br/>\nthink that their CULTURE and his parents&#39; expectations of him played a <br/>\npart in his sloppiness?  I suspect that while his grandmother, mother <br/>\nand sisters were keeping the house and doing all the work, the <br/>\ngrandfather, father and uncles were sitting around smoking cigarettes, <br/>\ndrinking ouzo and playing tavli (backgammon)!  I believe your son&#39;s <br/>\nfather was paying closer attention to his male relatives&#39; modeling <br/>\nrather than the women&#39;s.  He was identifying with the men - not the <br/>\nwomen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the daughter of a Greek father and having had quite a lot of contact <br/>\nwith Greek culture, I know that in many Greek families the sons are not <br/>\nexpected to do as much of the housework (if any at all)  as the <br/>\ndaughters are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at a map you&#39;ll see Albania shares a border with Greece.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve had contact with 2 Albanian families and they were not very <br/>\ndifferent from the Greeks.<br/>\n From what you write, I have the impression he grew up in a household <br/>\nwhere the men gave very little respect to the women or the work they did <br/>\nand basically treated them like slaves.  That&#39;s probably why he turned <br/>\nout the way he did.  He could be as sloppy as he wanted to be because <br/>\nthere was always a pretty, nice, quiet, little Albanian woman/girl <br/>\ncleaning up after him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to go to the Greek Festival here in Houston every October.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t gone in years because it disgusted me to see all the women doing <br/>\nALL the work and the men just standing around doing nothing except maybe <br/>\npour a glass or retsina or two.  And, of course, it&#39;s the men that take <br/>\nall the credit.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreek men (probably Albanians too) are wonderful lovers, but I would <br/>\nNEVER want to marry one!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blood flowing through my boys&#39; veins is a beautiful mixture of many <br/>\ndifferent ethnic groups - the largest portion (25%) of which is Greek.  <br/>\nMy boys seem to identify with me as much as they do with their father - <br/>\nbut we are an American family - not an Eastern Mediterranean family in <br/>\nwhich the roles of men and women are much more defined.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house I do about 75% of the housework.  I&#39;m basically a slob and <br/>\nso is my husband, but I&#39;m trying to change that.  When I do housework, I <br/>\nmake sure my boys see me doing it.  It&#39;s amazing how often they want to <br/>\njump in and help.  I rarely force them to do anything.  My husband will <br/>\nmake them pick up their room once in a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne VERY good thing my mother did with my siblings and I is that she <br/>\nnever made us do chores.  She often said &quot;you&#39;re a child only once and <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have your whole life to work&quot;.     Where I think she went wrong <br/>\nwas she did all her housework while we were in school.  I hardly ever <br/>\nremember SEEING her clean.
