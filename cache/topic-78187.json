I don&#39;t know how you all are <br/>\n&quot;surviving&quot;.  My parents lost a 7 week old baby (31?) years ago to spinal <br/>\nmenigitis.  I was 5 at the time.  I remember very little about my young childhood, <br/>\nbut I have vivid memories of the night my dad found her in bed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo this day, I MISS MY LITTLE SIS very dearly.  I&#39;m the only one (well, <br/>\nbesides one aunt) who knows where she is burried, exactly.  My parents didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto know at the time, so we didn&#39;t (and, Catholics don&#39;t hold that tradition <br/>\nanyway) go to the grave site.  And actually, she&#39;s burried on the plot of my <br/>\ngreat grandparents.  There are 3 other babies in the grave (they used to do that, <br/>\ntoo, but, they don&#39;t do that anymore).  We always thought there were only 2 <br/>\nothers in the grave, but, when I went to the Cemetary, oh, I don&#39;t know, 18 <br/>\nyears ago, to find exactly where she is (no grave marker & didn&#39;t know where my <br/>\ngreat grandparents were), I was told about the 3rd.  Now we know who it is.  <br/>\nThe baby was the child of a neighbor friend of my grandparents.  When the baby <br/>\ndied, they didn&#39;t have a plot nor could they afford one at the time (same as my <br/>\nparents), so my great grandma let them put the baby on their plot.  I would <br/>\nlove to get a tomb stone for my sister, unfortunately, I can&#39;t.  We have to <br/>\nhave the WRITTEN permission of ALL of the families w/babies in that plot; we can <br/>\nonly track down 3 (including us) of the 4 :-(.  We don&#39;t know where the <br/>\nsurviving family members of the neighbor are.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a little kid, I had these dreams about my little sis (Lydia Sue).  <br/>\nI used to dream (almost everynight for a while up to the age of 10 or so, and <br/>\nthen reoccuring well past my 20&#39;s) that Mary (mother of Jesus) would be <br/>\nstanding there, and in her arms was my sis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of you are not religious, and I&#39;m not trying to throw my beliefs <br/>\nat you.  Just wanted to share my story.  I really feel for all you parents.  I <br/>\nknow how I felt being the sister, so I KNOW it must be harder for the rest of <br/>\nyou.
