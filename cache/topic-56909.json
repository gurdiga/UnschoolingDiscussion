I put the Suzuki cd in and just left it<br/>\nplaying. (My dh complained, but I said I needed to listen to it).  My dd<br/>\ncame out of her room and it was on, she didn&#39;t comment at all.  After about<br/>\nan hour she asked me to turn it off.  I  asked her why she wanted me to turn<br/>\nit off, and she said because she wanted to practice (I know, icky word).  I<br/>\nturned it off and she played for a while.  Then she asked me to turn the CD<br/>\nback on to a certain song.  I asked if she could tell me about what number<br/>\nit would be,  she very casually said it was the first song in Book 2.  I<br/>\nfound it and she listened several times.  She then went and worked on it!<br/>\nYeah!  And I hadn&#39;t even mentioned that we were going to a lesson next week,<br/>\nbut I had played piano and listened to the CD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure not everyday will go like this, but it sure was great!  Thanks for<br/>\nthe inspiration you all!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, she also started knitting a pair of socks yesterday.  Which is pretty<br/>\ncool to me.  I have never knitted socks.  I did show her how to knit at<br/>\nabout seven years old, when she asked, and then bought her a knitting book.<br/>\nShe has learned lots from that and gone way beyond me!<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks again,<br/>\nerin<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &quot;start playing piano yourself.
