Even if the one doing so is<br/>\n8. stop the situation, remove the offender from the situation, talk to the<br/>\nhitee, and later go back and talk with the hitter.

My daughter is the one that hits (she&#39;s almost 8) and she is so embarrased by it but says she can&#39;t stop it.  So we&#39;ve been talking alot about how upset her 9 yr old brother is making her. I in turn then talk with my son also,  he has no idea that he is upsetting her so much.  We really had a good talk last night,  I  told her about myself, being a little sister and how my brother used to make me feel bad.  Trying to enlighten her on the fact that he&#39;s not intentionally trying to hurt her.  I think Sandra and others have some really good points about giving respect to our children.

Kirby&#39;s worst time was when he was 12, and we all would shake our heads <br/>\nand take deep breaths and just hope he would grow out of it, which he did, <br/>\nbeautifully.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT when it was still in the awful period, I would get Marty out of Kirby&#39;s <br/>\nroom and let him vent and tell me his side.  While that was happening, Marty <br/>\nwas feeling comforted and Kirby was calming down, straightening up his stuff, <br/>\nthinking bad thoughts about Marty or whatever, but his adrenaline was going <br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d find something Marty could be involved with, whether actually needed or <br/>\nsomething he had wanted to do but forgotten, or whether it was a kinda <br/>\ntrumped up &quot;Could you take the dog out to play?&quot; or &quot;Could you water the back <br/>\nyard a bit?&quot;  Something good, useful and distracting for Marty that made him <br/>\nfeel important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I would go back to Kirby&#39;s room and say &quot;Marty needs to be safe in his <br/>\nown home, y&#39;know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he would say &quot;My stuff needs to be safe ind.  Sometimes Marty had just <br/>\nleft out one important detail (the reason Kirby got angry, usually &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>\nSometimes it was misinterpretation.  I&#39;d ask Kirby what could have gone <br/>\nbetter.  I would remind Kirby of the process:  First talk.  Second get an <br/>\nadult to help.  THIRD hit.  I would not go with &quot;Never, never hit,&quot; because <br/>\nif someone grabs these kids against their will, I want them to hit with <br/>\nfeeling.  If someone&#39;s hurting their sister or stealing their gameboy, <br/>\nhitting&#39;s okay with me.  But I would go with his having hit without getting <br/>\nassistance FIRST.  It was a technicality which had some benefits, one of them <br/>\nbeing the kids&#39; hope that maybe if an adult failed to negotiate the problem <br/>\nthey had plan C--hitting.  I just made sure I never once failed to negotiate <br/>\nsuccessfully.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d help Kirby process what happened, thank him for whatever he HAD done <br/>\nright and good (sharing his room and stuff in the first place, being willing <br/>\nto discuss it, calming down), and ask him again to try to be more patient and <br/>\nto get help sooner next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I&#39;d go BACK to Marty and say, &quot;So...  You didn&#39;t tell me you called him <br/>\na butt.&quot;  (Or whatever it was...)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut by then Marty would be all calmed down too, and feeling better about <br/>\nhimself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if that answers the question or not, and I&#39;m not positive I <br/>\nunderstand the question.
