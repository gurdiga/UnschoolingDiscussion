I have a bread book called The Tassajahara Bread Book by Edward Brown.  In his intro. to the 1995 edition that I have he writes,<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;Someone told me recently that learning how to bake bread from my book was like regaining his life from corporate America.  &quot;A rite of passage&quot; he said,... &quot;an initiation&quot;, a reconnection with the earth, our roots, our common heritage...Please carry on the work of feeding, the work of the heart...

I don&#39;t know that it convinced me completely however since I use a corporate American Kitchenaid to do most of my kneading!  But I got inspired by his recipes to make my own bread, several kinds.  And I know that the more I knead, the better it tastes.
