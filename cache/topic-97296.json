Welcome this as an opportunity to <br/>\ncritically examine your own ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to public <br/>\nexamination, don&#39;t post it to the list. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether people ask for advice or not, the purpose of the list is to discuss <br/>\nthe ideas presented, for the benefit of anyone who might be reading and <br/>\nconsidering what can help unschooling work better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, the focus of respect on the list is respect for unschooling <br/>\nand respect for children.   I know there is a traditional kind of  support <br/>\nwhich is hand-holding and soothing and clucking and tends toward &quot;there there, <br/>\nthose children will be the death of us, you&#39;re doing a great job, don&#39;t think <br/>\nabout it anymore.&quot;   It&#39;s not the best sort of &quot;support&quot; for someone who wants <br/>\nto get to unschooling and more mindful parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while I&#39;m sorry when someone has misunderstood, the policies have been <br/>\nclearly stated for a long time, and each new member gets an e-mail with links to <br/>\nthem (if not an e-mail with the rules themselves).  I know school and charge <br/>\ncard contracts can help people want to ignore details and directions, but if <br/>\nindividuals are unaware of the purpose of the list, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the fault <br/>\nof the moderators.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97259,"nextTopicId":97286}}
