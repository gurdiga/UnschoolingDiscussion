The Texas Memorial Museum has<br/>\nmillions of fossils in its<br/>\ncollections. Spanning hundreds of millions of years, our fossils tell the<br/>\nstory of the natural history of Texas. At<br/>\nany given time, however, only a fraction of TMM&#39;s fossils are on display in<br/>\nexhibits. The rest are in our<br/>\nresearch labs, on loan to other museums around the world, or stored in our<br/>\ncollection areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis exhibit allows us to show off some of TMM&#39;s finest fossils. Some, like<br/>\nthe saber-toothed cat and the<br/>\nexquisite starfish from South Austin, are old favorites that haven&#39;t been on<br/>\ndisplay in<br/>\nyears. Others, like Chasmosaurus and the plesiosaur, are newer acquisitions<br/>\nthat have never been seen in<br/>\npublic. In addition to our own specimens, we are fortunate enough to have a<br/>\nfew rare pieces on loan for this<br/>\nexhibit. Two specimens are on loan from other museums: Confuciusornis from the<br/>\nBeijing Museum of Natural<br/>\nHistory, and Thrinaxodon from The University of California at Berkeley. In<br/>\naddition, Diplocaulus is on loan<br/>\nfrom a private collector. We are grateful to these lenders for allowing us the<br/>\nchance to display their specimens.<br/>\n<br/>\nlink: Scratching the Surface Again!
