Geometry was good, Algebra I suffered in terribly in high school so I<br/>\navoided all the math I could in college. I was told that having my children<br/>\nhome would be okay when they were little, but how was I ever going to help<br/>\nthem with algebra or calculus. Luckily for us, I jumped in without thinking<br/>\nabout all the reasons I shouldn&#39;t hs.  What I learned was that if my child<br/>\nwanted to learn something he would and I don&#39;t have to know everything<br/>\nfirst. Our first year home, they actually taught me things I&#39;d never been<br/>\nexposed to.

She said that in her<br/>\n&gt;district they force you to work the hours the school children are in school<br/>\n&gt;and use a curriculum or the school&#39;s books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d heard this too. I figured I could pretend to do the same number of<br/>\nhours since I&#39;d been in the school and saw first hand how much time was<br/>\nwasted. Then my landlord who also homeschools gave me copies of the law.<br/>\nI&#39;ve counted days and never hours as I believe the hours are first too<br/>\ntimeconsuming to figure out (esp. when we don&#39;t DO subjects) but also<br/>\nbecause it makes more sense to just count the days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve heard from many people, most who aren&#39;t homeschoolers, I must admit,<br/>\n&gt;that their friends (always a friend, never a personal experience) were in<br/>\n&gt;trouble for not having a detailed log of daily schooling activities and<br/>\n&gt;work. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s amazing how many people are actually in trouble isn&#39;t it&lt;g&gt;? I came to<br/>\nthe conclusion that most people are threatened by the idea of hsing and<br/>\nalthough most having good intentions will let the rumors fly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n In fact, my landlady is a teacher and last year she turned me in to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;children and youth. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\n Although Children and Youth said the accusation was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;unfounded they were forced to make several visits, according to their rules.<br/>\n&gt;They even looked into my children&#39;s health records by writing to their<br/>\n&gt;doctors.  The landlady said that the woman before me was arrested for not<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling &quot;according to the state&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She rented to someone else who hsed?  I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s any of her<br/>\nbusiness.  How you hs is an issue between you, your children, the<br/>\nevaluator, and the district. Others have no right to but in IMO.  Do you<br/>\nstill rent from this woman?  I&#39;d have a hard time being civil towards her,<br/>\nI give you a lot of credit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There is a lot of misinformation out there.  A lot of people don&#39;t have a<br/>\n&gt;clue as to how easy and rewarding homeschooling really is.

She&#39;s taking the steps to withdraw her son for next year. A woman<br/>\ncame over and said she was sorry,but she&#39;d been listening in to us. She<br/>\nsaid it would seem like a good thing with the way the schools are, but she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t handle to be home with her  kids all day.  I had a similar problem<br/>\nwith my oldest so I guess I could relate, but what she doesn&#39;t realize is<br/>\nthat without a lot of the pressures of school her children could be much<br/>\nmore relaxed at home and she might find that they could be a really close<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I wish there was a forum to get to everyone, especially those who don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt;computers and those who don&#39;t know how to use the one&#39;s they have, and shout<br/>\n&gt;to them that unschooling is LEGAL and a way of life.

Another mom and I tried to start a hs support group<br/>\nlast year, but found ourselves being judged by the families who showed up.<br/>\nThey came to show us how to hs, and their way was school at home.

He doesn&#39;t test, he<br/>\nwill ask about things he sees in the portfolio and finds interesting then<br/>\nwatches the child to see how interested he/she was in the activity. My son<br/>\nshares his favorite book titles and stuff with this guy and they get into<br/>\nquite a discussion on their views of history. This way the interview is fun<br/>\nfor both of them, but he can really see the wide span of interests and<br/>\nknowledge my son has acquired on his own.  It seems to take longer than<br/>\nmost evaluations IMO, taking 1.5 to 2 hours long, but for $20 that&#39;s not<br/>\nbad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that he found interesting for my son&#39;s last years<br/>\nevaluation was his role in a hsing play. My son had the lead, and since his<br/>\ndaughter was in the play he attended one of the shows. So in the evaluation<br/>\nhe wrote a raving review of my sons performance stating for the district<br/>\nthat he&#39;d seen him.  This year it was our two weeks living at the Winona<br/>\nFarm meeting other unschoolers from Australia that were living there and<br/>\nthe things we learned through this that got the center attention on the<br/>\nportfolio.

The way I homeschooled for the first four years was scary.<br/>\n&gt;Mom against child.  Child against mom.  Fear and anger abounded as I tried<br/>\n&gt;to make a meticulous log and fill it with the most impossible stuff.  ie:<br/>\n&gt;Math pages 92-97, Social Studies, pages 65-72, answer questions on 72, and<br/>\n&gt;on and on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I too tried this as I was worried about evaluations and turning in our logs<br/>\nand portfolios. But that lasted about two months, my oldest and I went<br/>\nrounds on this and my youngest wasn&#39;t comprehending much. I had read the<br/>\nteenage liberation handbook and knew that would work with my oldest so we<br/>\nstarted with him to see if unschooling really worked. From there it didn&#39;t<br/>\ntake long to change the way my youngest got to spend the day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;My home is happy again, my daughter Brandy is enjoying her education and<br/>\n&gt;learning alot.  She doesn&#39;t get beat up at school because she isn&#39;t there.<br/>\n&gt;Noone teases her because at 11 she doesn&#39;t wear makeup or shave her legs (I<br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t let her, poor kid) and on and on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We had such horrible experiences homeschooling that I sent the children back<br/>\n&gt;to school last September and all of those things were happening to Brandy on<br/>\n&gt;a daily basis so we brought her home again. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How horrible, but from our schools here, I know your district isn&#39;t the<br/>\nexception.  Our district went k-4, 5-8, 9-12. My oldest had so much trouble<br/>\nin the middle school that I knew I didn&#39;t want my youngest to ever walk<br/>\ninto the 5th grade here. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest was diagnosed ADD, but I&#39;ve learned that ADD (for us) isn&#39;t a<br/>\nproblem at all unless we want to consider school again. My youngest now has<br/>\ngotten back his self esteem and doing wonderful things, with the help of a<br/>\nneighbor he learned how to build computers and sold his first complete<br/>\ncomputer to our evaluator last week!!!  We joke that we won&#39;t have to prove<br/>\nto the evaluator that unschooling works here! <br/>\n<br/>\n Chris was impossible at home so<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;we left him in school, we&#39;ll see for the fall where he will be this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can relate to this also. We had such problems with our oldest that it<br/>\nmade home a horrible place for everyone. When he learned that I was<br/>\nplanning on hsing his brother he bugged to be allowed to come home. I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t imagine having him home all the time, the tension just after<br/>\nschool was already too much. But within days of him leaving school he<br/>\nbecame a totally different person. Now that isn&#39;t to say that when I pulled<br/>\nteacher mode we got along much better, but he was smart enough to open my<br/>\neyes to the fact that he did intend to broaden his horizons. Once he felt<br/>\nthat his life was more in his control, he was back to a wonderful part of<br/>\nthe family. <br/>\nGood luck, I&#39;m sure you will all find the right decision between you.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; why did we take these big kids and stick them in an unnatural<br/>\n&gt;learning environment and expect them to become world leaders?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of my favorite quotes was from Einstein. He stated that after leaving<br/>\nschool it took him a couple of years to find a way to enjoy experimentation<br/>\nagain. Just think how different our world would have been if he didn&#39;t find<br/>\nthe spark inside himself again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve seen the light and if I make it through evaluation time and the school<br/>\n&gt;superintendent doesn&#39;t try to throw me in jail, I will continue to teach my<br/>\n&gt;children in the unschooling way for the rest of their childhoods.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hopefully you won&#39;t find yourself in jail.lol.  I haven&#39;t had any problems<br/>\nhere. We found an evaluator who was wonderful, (yes the same one who bought<br/>\nthe computer). His wife teaches at home using all ABeka curriculum, but he<br/>\nsays that he looks forward to doing our evaluations because we do such<br/>\ninteresting things!  He has written wonderful add ons to our evaluation for<br/>\nmy son each year and approved my oldest&#39;s wish to jump a grade from 7th-9th<br/>\nby demonstrating just how much he learned in one year unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen looking for an evaluator, we asked others in the area, then narrowed<br/>\nit down to a couple individuals. From there we simply made a phone call to<br/>\neach asking them if they had openings and describing the educational<br/>\nopinion that we held (being that unschooling/child led was the only way to<br/>\nlearn) We were open about our lack of textbooks/workbooks. The individual<br/>\nwe choose was open about the fact that he&#39;d never evaluated anyone using an<br/>\nunschooling approach but if we&#39;d bring examples of things my son used he<br/>\nwould give us an honest evaluation. I wouldn&#39;t change evaluators for<br/>\nanything at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nLois</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"KaeKaeB2@xxx.xxx","from":"KaeKaeB2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xUQ85esJXvOdRHpcR-fRxYpT41FvrVSFbCREQrt2DGbdZK0G3ohkFmqnbMPbIFHyQ-lQTBpktw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kim&#39;s Introduction","postDate":"928254806","msgId":41,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMi40MS45NTkyNjk3MzlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38,"nextInTopic":42,"prevInTime":40,"nextInTime":42,"topicId":38,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/1/99 11:22:45 AM Central Daylight Time, cook4you@ptd.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-210763988\">In a message dated 6/1/99 11:22:45 AM Central Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cook4you@...\">cook4you@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve seen the light and if I make it through evaluation time and the school<br/>\n superintendent doesn&#39;t try to throw me in jail, I will continue to teach my<br/>\n children in the unschooling way for the rest of their childhoods.<br/>\n <br/>\n Thank you for having me! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow Kim!

I guess the list is growing by leaps and bounds judging from the<br/>\nnumber of intros today.  That&#39;s wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Kim and I&#39;m from Pennsylvania.  I am 36 and have three<br/>\nchildren...My son Chris is 14, my daughter Brandy is 11, and my daughter<br/>\nTabitha is 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I&#39;ve homeschooled for five years I&#39;ve only been on the Internet for<br/>\nless than one.  The way I homeschooled for the first four years was scary.<br/>\nMom against child.  Child against mom.  Fear and anger abounded as I tried<br/>\nto make a meticulous log and fill it with the most impossible stuff.  ie:<br/>\nMath pages 92-97, Social Studies, pages 65-72, answer questions on 72, and<br/>\non and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen this past February I was surfing around in Onelist and found a<br/>\nPennyslvania list for homeschoolers that didn&#39;t mention unschooling.  (I ran<br/>\nfrom the &quot;unschooling&quot; lists as they seemed to me to be blatantly illegal<br/>\nand horrifying).  It turned out that the Pa list was open to all from Pa but<br/>\nthe majority of the members were minimalist at the least and unschoolers if<br/>\nthe truth be told.  It opened my eyes and my heart to this method of<br/>\nlearning and I&#39;ve never turned back.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy home is happy again, my daughter Brandy is enjoying her education and<br/>\nlearning alot.  She doesn&#39;t get beat up at school because she isn&#39;t there.<br/>\nNoone teases her because at 11 she doesn&#39;t wear makeup or shave her legs (I<br/>\nwon&#39;t let her, poor kid) and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had such horrible experiences homeschooling that I sent the children back<br/>\nto school last September and all of those things were happening to Brandy on<br/>\na daily basis so we brought her home again.  Chris was impossible at home so<br/>\nwe left him in school, we&#39;ll see for the fall where he will be this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this way of life is the best thing for a child.  It&#39;s incredible<br/>\nthat so few people dare it.  I look at my four year old who was supposed to<br/>\nbe retarded (she was a micro preemie) and see someone who learns everyday in<br/>\neveryway.  She was singled out in her preschool for testing because they<br/>\nthink she&#39;s years ahead.  So if that&#39;s how little one&#39;s learn, just by<br/>\ndoing, why did we take these big kids and stick them in an unnatural<br/>\nlearning environment and expect them to become world leaders?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen the light and if I make it through evaluation time and the school<br/>\nsuperintendent doesn&#39;t try to throw me in jail, I will continue to teach my<br/>\nchildren in the unschooling way for the rest of their childhoods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for having me!<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111339,"nextTopicId":111343}}
