Mine were here last week<br/>\nfor a visit.  My father and I got into it and they ended their<br/>\ntrip 2 days early.  I am a 4.5 day drive from them (4 or so hours<br/>\nby plane) and I like it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike you I am focusing on my children, husband and myself.  I can<br/>\ndo nothing to help them change -- that must come from within<br/>\nthemselves!  Your comment about your father&#39;s power trip opened<br/>\nmy eyes to why my father does that type of thing -- thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings!  I have really enjoyed hearing about your Pagan beliefs.<br/>\nMy Samhain will be very different this year -- I&#39;m more Buddhist<br/>\nthan any other belief but I&#39;m being drawn more and more to Pagan<br/>\ncelebrations.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;tn-k4of5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"iIl7IBZCw6naGkdo_4e3rDKxPqoEeizSfG96DDjLws8JPeGJXuKaHSyYL38cN4bwNlZAFLteMBesiDOUx9mPUVrxziptS9fWcsqJqs40h7SPfApMZLekMBA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Long Distance Grandparents","postDate":"938796441","msgId":3498,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzYuMzQ5OC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3512,"prevInTime":3497,"nextInTime":3499,"topicId":3498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... my ...

When the opportunity arose, I jumped on it.  I also have  no<br/>\ndesire to go visit their house any time in the near future.  Since we moved<br/>\nin March, they have already been out to visit us once, for a weekend.  That<br/>\nis about all that I can handle of them, one weekend in MY house, MY rules.<br/>\nThey are much easier for me, and DH, to handle that way.  I make sure that<br/>\nmy kids know who they are, talk to them on the phone and have a positive<br/>\nimage of them and relationship with them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I am using my energy to work on stability and growth in our<br/>\nimmediate family.  I do not have the energy or desire left right now to<br/>\nwork on the relationship with my parents.  It is always very one sided, and<br/>\nI cannot forgive their past behavior when they continue it every time I<br/>\nsee/talk to them.  I know that they are not going to change, and I am not<br/>\nwilling to accept their abuse.  Even my DH does not like to spend time with<br/>\nthem, although they are usually nice to him.  He does not enjoy watching<br/>\nthem torture me.  He will often ask my dad, after he has goaded me into<br/>\ngetting really upset (ONCE AGAIN) &quot;Why do you do that to her??&quot;  Of course<br/>\nhe knows the reasons.  It&#39;s a power trip for him.  But that doesn&#39;t make it<br/>\nhurt less or be less upsetting.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor us, the distance is a blessing.  It enables us to maintain (mostly)<br/>\npeaceful relations, if sparing in frequency.  It enables the boys to<br/>\nmaintain a positive image of their grandparents while they are little.  It<br/>\ndoes not allow my parents to interfere with my child rearing, degrade my<br/>\nself esteem, judge me, emotionally abuse my children in the same ways they<br/>\ndid me, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my inlaws are completely another story.  They are coming for a long<br/>\nweekend in mid Oct. and we can all hardly wait.  They are very affectionate<br/>\ngrandparents and very down-to-earth people.  We would really enjoy seeing<br/>\nmore of them in our lives, but they live near my parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3510,"nextTopicId":3514}}
