I have tried<br/>\nover the last several days (since this thread) to not make the kids do<br/>\nchores, but to ask for their assistance at times.  I have done the things,<br/>\nwhich up until last week were their chores.  They haven&#39;t really noticed.  I<br/>\nhave asked for help at times, and sometimes received it. Sometimes they have<br/>\ncomplained that they didn&#39;t want to, etc. and I left it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are 13 and 15(tomorrow).  I have always been what people would<br/>\nconsider lax about chores, but in the last year or so have tried to give<br/>\nthem more responsiblity.  It has definitely all been met with whining and<br/>\ncomplaining, and the only real way to get them to do the stuff was for me to<br/>\ncontinually remind them.   So, the house has definitely been more peaceful<br/>\nw/o asking them to do things like dishes and take out the trash, but things<br/>\nare also not getting done.  I asked my daughter to run the dishwasher while<br/>\nI was gone yesterday, and she said she would, but she didn&#39;t.  How do I<br/>\napproach this with her?  I have considered sitting them down and telling<br/>\nthem about my new approach, but am afraid that they will use that to decide<br/>\nnot to help at all.  I cannot do it all myself (physically), and though I<br/>\nthink they know that, I am not sure that will matter in the new found<br/>\nfreedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo throw a wrench in the whole thing, my husband is not currently working,<br/>\nand is home all the time, he has always been one to just leave all of his<br/>\nmess for me to clean up (though I am a lousy housekeeper and don&#39;t do it<br/>\nwell).

When I used to work in a busy hospital ER, (I am an xray tech), you had to be quick, efficient, sometimes very creative, and work under pressure with many other people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest complaint with some of the people I worked with is that they had no idea how to work well with others.    A problem with seeing what needed done, what the other person(tech) was doing, and what they could do to contribute to get the job done.  Examples:  If I am positioning the patient for a film, the other person should be setting the equipment for the exposure.  If I am visiting with the patient, getting a history or whatever, the other person should be doing the paperwork.  It was a delicate give and take kind of working environment.  We usually tried to take turns positioning patients and doing the paperwork so one person didn&#39;t feel like they were stuck doing the same thing all day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were people with whom I worked well with but there was always the 2 or 3 people that seemed lost most days. (I wasn&#39;t the only one noticing this....I work well with others, ....really).  We would end up tripping over each other, not getting the work done because I thought he/she did it or vice versa, they needed to be reminded of what was still left to do, etc......  As I am typing this I am starting to think that maybe they just didn&#39;t give a shit.  If they had a passion for the job, as I did, maybe they would CARE about efficiency, good patient care, and helping the doctor diagnose patients.  When you have a physician waiting and bitching about, &quot;Where are my x-rays!??!!&quot; because the patient had a neck injury or chest pain, etc..., you really need to get the job done, well, the first time (no repeating films).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is that I want my kids to have that sense of how to contribute to a situation.  I think it is an important trait/skill to have for anyone in any profession or relationship.   I want them to be able to look around and see what needs to be done, and (want to) do it.  I am not as much talking about housework and picking up after themselves now (though I am pretty anal about cleaning but I am really working on that), but for when they are older.  Whether it&#39;s a job or a spouse or whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; What will happen to your chldren if they don&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that my son will grow into a responsible man who can see things<br/>\nthat need doing, both at home and in the world, and realize that he is<br/>\nsomeone who can do them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s already starting to do that.
