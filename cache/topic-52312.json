Glad to know<br/>\nthat I am not the only one out there being called horrible names by my son.<br/>\nYesterday I asked him to stay with me while dropping off his sister at a play<br/>\nrehersal with 250 kids. It was crowded and I felt the need to have him near.<br/>\nHe is not quite 6. You butt head ,at the top of his lungs, for a minute is<br/>\nwhat I was called. I held his hand, brought his sister to her activity and hen<br/>\nasked him what he wanted to look at. I really don&#39;t want to add to his misery<br/>\nby giving him some punishment. Yet I want him to understand that it makes the<br/>\nrest of us miserable to be called a bunch of names. My job of escorting his<br/>\nsister was made more difficult because he ran away, called me names, and<br/>\nrefused to join me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no real helpful suggestion. I am a parent who deals with a beautiful<br/>\nboy who explodes for seemingly small things. Losing at a game, being last,<br/>\nbeing second,not getting his way, having to share. Keep up the suggestions<br/>\nescpecially those families that have seen them mature.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52304,"nextTopicId":52316}}
