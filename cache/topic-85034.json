There are no hard and fast animal rules.<br/>\n      Attributing human acts to animal nature seems to me to be a fatalistic view of things and a complete repudiation (hows that for a big word! :) ) of the free will that&#39;s supposed to be part of being human. <br/>\n      And....(rambling on I go) seeing spanking as part of the tools a parent uses seems a little strange to me as most times (as in my case) its used by parents who only have that one &#39;parenting&#39; tool.

As I stated I anticipated this to be <br/>\nan unpopular opinion and I am not disappointed. I don&#39;t need to justify my <br/>\nsystem to you and more than you need to justify your system to me. What works in <br/>\nthe training of one individual to become a functional and stable human being <br/>\nmay not in fact be the most functional for another.

I see also that we are at odds with the benefit of <br/>\nthis condition. I strongly believe that losing our animal nature is false and <br/>\noften detrimental for society. When one holds themselves above their base <br/>\nnature then how can they gain an understanding of that which drives their <br/>\nreactions towards the training of their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding is the key. I am not certain what point you are making with <br/>\nyour comments about thirteen and fourteen year olds walking away from their <br/>\nparents. I am certain however, that the current politics involved with limited <br/>\nacceptance of breast feeding and the use of a family bed being child abusive are <br/>\nas equally misinterpreted as appropriate physical restraint can be when it is <br/>\napplied judiciously and without rage or malice.

The culture we&#39;re in now has gone through a long ugly period of <br/>\n&gt; discouraging ANYTHING biological, including breastfeeding.

The reason I recommend this is that it <br/>\nis FAR more effective to help him learn to express himself in <br/>\nproductive ways than it is to try to stop him from expressing himself <br/>\nin problematic ways.

Myrna Shure&#39;s <br/>\napproach is very effective - she helps parents help kids learn the <br/>\nvocabulary of feelings - and how to expresss themselves in <br/>\nsolution-oriented ways.  There are games and puppet play and stuff like <br/>\nthat to use - but even if you didn&#39;t DO all that, just reading her book <br/>\nwill give you tremendous insight into helping kids who are having <br/>\ntrouble communicating effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other book is &quot;How to Talk So Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids <br/>\nwill Talk&quot; -- I think you&#39;ll feel a lot more in control of yourself if <br/>\nyou have some predetermined responses like this book can offer.

I&#39;ve always wanted him to have <br/>\nemotional freedom so I&#39;ve tried really hard not to ding him for <br/>\ncoming across as disrespectful when I knew he was just frustrated and <br/>\nangry. Many times he is (still) moody because of his allergies.

It took my son until he was about 8 to understand it. I just <br/>\nkept asking him if he wanted us to talk to him the way he did us. <br/>\nThat didn&#39;t help much so finally I recorded him once and played it <br/>\nback to him. He was stunned and tried to say &quot;that wasn&#39;t me&quot;.

As he has gotten older...when he <br/>\nstarts, I immediately ask him if I have done something to anger him. <br/>\nWhen he says no, I ask him not to continue with the tone. That ticks <br/>\nhim off but after hethinks about it, he&#39;ll apologize on his own. We <br/>\nstill discuss anger displacement and how that affects him and his <br/>\nfamily and friends.

I usually acknowledge<br/>\nher anger along the lines of &quot;I see that you are upset that I am going to<br/>\nbed. You want me to stay out here with you.&quot; Then I explain my position,<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m too sleepy to stay awake, so I&#39;m going to the bedroom&quot;. Then I give her<br/>\nsome suggestions of choices, &quot;You can stay out here and watch Max and Ruby,<br/>\nbut I won&#39;t be coming out to put it on again because I will be sleeping. You<br/>\ncan watch cartoons by yourself out here, or you can come in to the bedroom<br/>\nwith us and watch cartoons or a dvd.&quot; Then I go. My experience is that she<br/>\nfollows quickly.

Will you say it again?&quot; She often tries to<br/>\ncalm herself enough to speak clearly enough to be comprehended. (Naturally I<br/>\nonly tell her the truth about whether I can understand her or not - it is<br/>\nnot a manipulation) We save broader discussions about behavior, like &quot;saying<br/>\nmean things&quot; for times when we are all calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I slapped my child. :o(<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Shan, this may not be the most popular response but, I have to tell you<br/>\nthat you need to allow yourself a bit of levity here. In the wild animals<br/>\nregularly show, not tell, their young that certain specific behaviors are<br/>\nabsolutely<br/>\nnot to be tolerated. This type of corporal punishment, in the animal world,<br/>\nis typically very judiciously applied and so, when it does occur there is a<br/>\nreal and abrupt awakening in the young which enables them to immediately cue<br/>\nin<br/>\non the importance of the message being delivered by the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I don&#39;t have information about &#39;how&#39; you slapped your child. This<br/>\nhas bearing to the situation because loss of control is a warning to you and<br/>\nto<br/>\nyour child that the situation leading up to the physical altercation is not<br/>\nworking. Read that again, the situation leading up to the physical<br/>\naltercation..... not the moment itself. I have seen children raised<br/>\nsuccessfully with and<br/>\nwithout corporal punishment and I have seen the opposite. It boils down to<br/>\nthat some people require a more direct and obvious form of attention getting<br/>\nfrom<br/>\nthe parent on occasion and others are fine without a physical reminder of<br/>\nappropriate behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nProponents of absolutely NO corporal punishment are the same as any other<br/>\nfringe group-if the condition works for them great. But, if it isn&#39;t working<br/>\nfor<br/>\nyou then you need to adjust and be okay with your adjustments regardless of<br/>\nhow the fringe wishes to justify their own training methods and how people,<br/>\nas a<br/>\nspecies wants to justify their actions at another&#39;s expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel that you did lose control and the action on your part was overly<br/>\nsevere then an apology to your child is in order.  With a caveat. He must<br/>\nknow<br/>\nthat his actions have consequences and even parents have limitations.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\n<br/>\nTracey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Stauffer<br/>\nI&#39;m so sorry this happened, for you and your son.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Suggestion:<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is no way for things to go along like it just never happened.  So talk<br/>\nto your son.  Tell him you were wrong, that you are sorry, that you are<br/>\ntrying to find better ways.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Shan replies:] That is exactly what I did as soon as I finished writing the<br/>\nfirst time.  I cried and told him how sorry I was that I hit him and hitting<br/>\nis NOT OK.  He was still very angry.  But soon calmed down after I<br/>\napologized.  I told him I feel like I am not being a good mom right now.  I<br/>\ncant be a good mom when I feel like he is always angry and talking mean to<br/>\nme.  I asked him if there is something that I could do to help him change<br/>\nthe way he feels and talks.  He didnt really know what I was talking about.<br/>\nRemember he is 6.  I tried to put it in as simple of terms as possible.  So<br/>\nwhat I am going to do is try to do more outdoorsy things.  He is such a<br/>\nhomebody that it is really hard to get him to go anywhere.  But I think it<br/>\nmay help him if we get out more.  who knows.  But its worth a try.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Next, take a close look at what is going on with your son.  Why is he so<br/>\nangry with you?  Is it just aimed at you, or is he like this with everyone?&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nnow this is a hard one.  He is like this with everyone.  Its not just me.<br/>\nI/we (dh) tell him that the way he speaks to people is not acceptable.  This<br/>\nis an ongoing thing in our house.  His tone and word selection is just<br/>\ngrates on my and my dh nerves.  Weve joked with him.  Weve been stern with<br/>\nhim.  And then, today Ive been mean (wrong) with him.  Actually since this<br/>\nhappened this morning, things have been so much better.  I think he may get<br/>\nit.  At least I hope he does.  I hope this isnt a temporary thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Also, handle your emotions as they come up.  It sounds like perhaps you had<br/>\n </span></blockquote>been biting down your anger at your son&#39;s behavior and then you exploded on<br/>\nhim.  It is important to remember that NO ONE, not even a child, has the<br/>\nright to be abusive to others.  You most assuredly need to not allow him to<br/>\nbe abusive to you or anyone else.  You have the right and the responsibility<br/>\nto not let him demean others.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I stated above, I do tell ds that the way he talks to me and others hurts<br/>\nour feelings.  People dont like to be talked to like that even if he is<br/>\njoking.  It surely doesnt sound like a joke when your feelings are hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However, as you know, you do not have the right to slap him.  I do think it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is fine to tell a child &quot;You are really hurting my feelings when you call me<br/>\n&quot;stupid&quot; and I don&#39;t want to play anymore.&quot;  and get up and leave the room.<br/>\nOr to tell them &quot;I don&#39;t feel like helping you with this project when you<br/>\nare mean to me and saying $#@*& is mean&quot;.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I dont have any right to slap him.  I feel like such a loser right<br/>\nnow.  I cant believe it has come to this.  ds personality is such that he<br/>\nwhenever Ive put my foot down and left the game or room or whatever the<br/>\ncase was, he just feels SO rejected and falls completely apart in a huge<br/>\nraging screaming fit until I or dh come back to the room.  So this method<br/>\ncertainly doesnt work with him.  I guess Im going to have to find a better<br/>\nway of talking to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Help!

I put a stop to it so that I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nlose my temper, but at that point I think he also knew<br/>\nthat my anger was justified.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried this, depeneding on the situation, like<br/>\nif he seemed ready to listen for a minute.

In the wild animals <br/>\nregularly show, not tell, their young that certain specific behaviors are absolutely <br/>\nnot to be tolerated. This type of corporal punishment, in the animal world, <br/>\nis typically very judiciously applied and so, when it does occur there is a <br/>\nreal and abrupt awakening in the young which enables them to immediately cue in <br/>\non the importance of the message being delivered by the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I don&#39;t have information about &#39;how&#39; you slapped your child. This <br/>\nhas bearing to the situation because loss of control is a warning to you and to <br/>\nyour child that the situation leading up to the physical altercation is not <br/>\nworking. Read that again, the situation leading up to the physical <br/>\naltercation..... not the moment itself. I have seen children raised successfully with and <br/>\nwithout corporal punishment and I have seen the opposite. It boils down to <br/>\nthat some people require a more direct and obvious form of attention getting from <br/>\nthe parent on occasion and others are fine without a physical reminder of <br/>\nappropriate behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nProponents of absolutely NO corporal punishment are the same as any other <br/>\nfringe group-if the condition works for them great. But, if it isn&#39;t working for <br/>\nyou then you need to adjust and be okay with your adjustments regardless of <br/>\nhow the fringe wishes to justify their own training methods and how people, as a <br/>\nspecies wants to justify their actions at another&#39;s expense. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel that you did lose control and the action on your part was overly <br/>\nsevere then an apology to your child is in order.

Now I am completely<br/>\nremorseful of course.  But I dont know how to change it so that doesnt<br/>\nhappen again.  What am I doing wrong?  Is this an age thing?  Because<br/>\neverything that comes out of his mouth right now is nothing but a smart*ss<br/>\nremark or answer and I just am wearing thin.  My son has never been to<br/>\nschool and we are very easy people to get along with.  We dont enforce<br/>\nanything on him.  Im thinking at this point, maybe we should enforce some<br/>\nthings on him to change this behavior.  But then I come here and read and<br/>\nKNOW that that isnt the answer.  But I dont know what IS the answer.<br/>\nSomebody please help me get this straight.  &lt;sob&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":48651385,"authorName":"Norma","from":"&quot;Norma&quot; &lt;tessimal@...&gt;","profile":"tessimal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Racism and How It Effects the Human Brain","postDate":"1069430076","msgId":85034,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJwbGNmcytwOWlxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":85035,"prevInTime":85033,"nextInTime":85035,"topicId":85034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dartmouth Scientists Examine Effects of Racism on Brain The Boston Globe - Gareth Cook http://tinyurl.com/vzf4 Excellent article on how even latent racism","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-324146708\">&quot;Dartmouth Scientists Examine Effects of Racism on Brain&quot;<br/>\nThe Boston Globe - Gareth Cook<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/vzf4\">http://tinyurl.com/vzf4</a><br/>\n<br/>\nExcellent article on how even latent racism effects our brains, how<br/>\nit interferes with intellectual capacity.
