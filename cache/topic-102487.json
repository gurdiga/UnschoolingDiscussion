My oldest child <br/>\ndrives and knows gas prices because she&#39;s paying for gas. But the other <br/>\nkids - no. So the other day one asked me how much we DO spend driving <br/>\naround all the time - we&#39;ve been short of money recently, so they&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen hearing about how we need to cut back our spending - that&#39;s what <br/>\nprompted the interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - we drove along (gas burning at a rapid rate &lt;G&gt;) and figured out <br/>\nhow much it was costing us. They wanted to know how much difference it <br/>\nwould make if I&#39;d always go to the less expensive gas station, thinking <br/>\nthat could save us some money - but then, if I had to drive out of my <br/>\nway to go there, would that use up the savings? And on and on - lots <br/>\nand lots of computation - they pulled out scrap paper because we <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do it in our heads. I told them about mileage allowances - how <br/>\nwhen I work for a company I ask to be compensated for mileage and how <br/>\nthey always have a certain number of cents per mile and what that is <br/>\nsupposed to cover and we talked about how they&#39;d figure it. Then I <br/>\npointed out that prices for EVERYTHING we buy depend on gas prices - <br/>\nhow important they are because transportation is part of the cost of <br/>\nproduction of absolutely everything. So you&#39;re paying for gas when you <br/>\nbuy an ice cream cone or a pair of shoes or a set of Legos or anything <br/>\nelse.  And that went on to how to businesses decide how much to charge <br/>\nfor a product.
