Lately my husband and I have gone off to vote <br/>\nwith only our youngest who still thinks it&#39;s interesting. This time around, <br/>\nMichael, age 15. caught election fever and was very worked up by the time his <br/>\nfather and older sister got home from work. Jenny, age 19, was about to vote <br/>\nfor the first time but was not too sure about it. I asked her if she would <br/>\nconsider having her brother&#39;s help. She said she&#39;d been thinking about asking <br/>\nhim. We then prepared by discussing with the kids the decisions we&#39;d made <br/>\nabout candidates and propositions. They decided they agreed with us and we <br/>\nwrote it all down for them. Then off we went, all five of us. We filled three <br/>\nbooths: the teenagers in one, Dad and younger sister (11) in another and me <br/>\nby myself. Needless to say the ladies working there were very impressed and <br/>\nmy husband and I felt very happy. Now, of course, we&#39;re on pins and needles <br/>\nwith the rest of the country. It&#39;s interesting that Michael had asked his dad <br/>\nto explain the electoral college to him in detail about a week before. This <br/>\nled to the two of them cracking endless stupid jokes about the &quot;electrical&quot; <br/>\ncollege:&gt;) -Amalia-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"megates@juno.com","from":"megates@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Wv3sPvLYOdJHgHTVD2nU56FsdrfznlsiSpTLRboXl5fOVc5O0xZzyIkZUNXr9AKkX6I0A_wSSQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:election excitement","postDate":"973795795","msgId":14066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAxMTA5LjEwNTE1OS4tNTEzMTA1LjIubWVnYXRlc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14057,"nextInTopic":14069,"prevInTime":14065,"nextInTime":14067,"topicId":14056,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dd (7) has been fascinated!

You write each state&#39;s name and # of electoral votes on a slip of<br/>\npaper.  Take turns drawing a state, find it on the map, and tally the<br/>\npoints to see who wins.  (math, geography, social studies).  Today we<br/>\nfound a map of which presidential candidate won which state (on cnn.com)<br/>\nand played the game again - awarding the states according to who really<br/>\nwon it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother game she likes is quizzing mom and dad on the state capitols. <br/>\nShe reads the state and mom and dad race to see who can name the capital<br/>\nfirst.  Boy, are we rusty - she had to give us LOTS of hints!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nLa Leche League International Conference<br/>\nJuly 7-10, 2001, Chicago<br/>\nwww.lalecheleague.org.<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!

I think he&#39;s <br/>\nlearned so much from our discussions of how the elections work, and how <br/>\nother countries are governed, and how our government works, and so on.
