Another ... well, he was just told one night, &quot;I<br/>\ncan&#39;t do this anymore!&quot;  He was older than two and had a younger sibling who<br/>\nwas still nursing at night as well.  I just couldn&#39;t function anymore!  He<br/>\nwoke up for 4 nights.  The first night he fussed, didn&#39;t cry, for about 20<br/>\nminutes the first time he woke up.  I was there with him, talking to him<br/>\nabout it.  I do wish I had talked to him about it a bit first.  I told him<br/>\nthat night, when we went to bed.  It wasn&#39;t really fair to him or the other<br/>\nsleepers in my room!  They all would have appreciated some warning. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a 2 yo, I would suggest having help from another adult.  When I weaned<br/>\nMichael from night nursing, I had just read a snippet from one of Dr. Sears&#39;<br/>\nbooks that said they weaned from night time around 18 months as another baby<br/>\nwas on the way.  I thought, if he can do an 18 month old, I can certainly<br/>\nwean Michael!  He still nursed during the day but we did stop through the<br/>\nnight.  It helped immensely!<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Sears recommends having someone else walk the halls with the one who is<br/>\nbeing weaned for a few night to a couple of weeks.  My dh would not have<br/>\nbeen capable of that.  He doesn&#39;t deal with crying and frustration easily<br/>\nbut if yours can and will ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know when I weaned Maggie, she cried one night for awhile, poor Michael<br/>\nsat up in bed and said, &quot;just nurse her mom so **I** can go back to sleep!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I hate to see my kids cry, I could not take nursing her through the<br/>\nnight anymore. She was a few months past her 4th birthday.  Everytime I<br/>\nrolled over, she would arouse to nurse.  I would lay there, afraid to move<br/>\nat night. After a couple of nights, she was fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good tip, too, is to have dad and older child sleep in another room.  If<br/>\ntoddler wants to nurse, let him/her come to you and then put them back in<br/>\nthe other room.  After awhile, maybe he won&#39;t be waking anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs to you.  I know how hard it can be to tandem nurse.  I have done it a<br/>\ntotal of 4 years and didn&#39;t particularly enjoy it but it was what my kids<br/>\nneeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara Moreda<br/>\nVisit www.homeiscool.com for great deals on Usborne Books<br/>\nRent DVD&#39;s online through Mentura at www.homeiscool.com<br/>\nMommy to RJ (12/91), Michael (11/95) and Maggie (2/98)<br/>\nmailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homeiscool@...\">homeiscool@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mina@...\">mina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, January 01, 2004 12:59 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Co-sleeping and nursing<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Are you wanting to wean him or just stop or slow the night nursing?<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n&gt; &gt;isn&#39;t trying to wean Kaelin, just sleep a little more.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Tia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m first off looking to slow/stop the night nursing, because of the 4 mo<br/>\n&gt; old.
