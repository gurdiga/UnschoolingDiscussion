That knowledge is power and knowing what<br/>\nthat disability is and how you can fix it is a freeing thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad had the ear drum in one ear blown to smithereens when a shell<br/>\nexploded in a gun on his ship during the Korean War.  Blood running out of<br/>\nthe ear, the whole nine yards.  This is a severe disability as it affects<br/>\nnot only hearing but speaking and balance.  He is NOT disabled.  He<br/>\nresearched everything about this disability and even went on to being in the<br/>\nNaval reserves special skin diving forces for 20 years, something that<br/>\nsupposedly you can&#39;t do without the eardrum for balance, etc.  He sits with<br/>\nhis good ear toward speakers, televisions, etc.  He has learned to<br/>\ncompensate and has his own method of balance.  He was a tree topper when he<br/>\nfirst got home from the war.  He then became a pole climber for P.G & E.  He<br/>\nstill rides motorcycles at the age of 75.  He has a disability, he is NOT<br/>\ndisabled because he found solutions and doesn&#39;t allow it to limit him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a son who is both ADHD and dyslexic.  When he was very young, I<br/>\ninvestigated ways to help him and found that diet and freedom to be him<br/>\nworked for him as far as the hyperactivity were concerned.  When he was a<br/>\nlittle older we had long discussions and spent a lot of time at the library<br/>\n(no internet back in the dark ages) looking up resources so that he could<br/>\nmake an informed decision about Ritalin vs. diet, meditation, behavior<br/>\nmodification and other things that help.  He choose diet and learned to<br/>\nrecognize signals and &quot;modify his behavior&quot; patterns.  When his problems<br/>\nwith &quot;letters that don&#39;t act right&quot; bothered him, we (yes WE) found a PhD<br/>\nwho worked with kids that had what he called &quot;obsticles to overcome.&quot;  We<br/>\nwere really lucky because he believed that all children are simply small<br/>\npeople and that all people are individuals.  My son had input into all<br/>\nphases of the plan &quot;to make molehills out of mountains.&quot;  My son has<br/>\ndisabilities but he is NOT disabled.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Bridget &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, December 03, 2001 6:27 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Disabled and Words thread<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But if you are going to say, &quot;Hey, this worked for some people.<br/>\n&gt; Want to try<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it?&quot;  Why is it necessary to describe the person as disabled to do<br/>\n&gt; that?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not and that&#39;s my point.
