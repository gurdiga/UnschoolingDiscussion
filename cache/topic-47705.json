Being available, being involved, being <br/>\ninterested in your children&#39;s interests, seeing them as worthy, intelligent, <br/>\ncapable human beings, trusting them, not being coercive, dialoguing and <br/>\nmodeling decent behavior, stopping harmful behavior (not being coercive does <br/>\nnot mean allowing another human to be hurt at the hands of my child) and <br/>\ncaring about every aspect of their lives and happiness.<br/>\nThese are all things that tie into unschooling and not spanking for me.<br/>\nThere are parents that don&#39;t spank but are still really rotten parents <br/>\n(although not nearly as common).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother helpful thing for me was taking some positive parenting courses, <br/>\nincluding Stephen Glenn&#39;s nine week course titled after his book &quot;Raising <br/>\nSelf Reliant Children in a Self Indulgent World&quot;.<br/>\nSandra Dodd and Richard Pytowski&#39;s talk at the California Homeschooling <br/>\nconference is available on tape, and I highly recommend it.<br/>\nDaily meditation helps hugely.<br/>\nI have many inspirational books that help me focus and I try to read <br/>\nsomething every day to remind me of what is important right now, today.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: sigh","postDate":"1035507254","msgId":47865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBINEkwME1GT0lJRUNVQG10YTcucGx0bjEzLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":47862,"nextInTopic":47870,"prevInTime":47864,"nextInTime":47866,"topicId":47705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am new and the posts have been moving so<br/>\nquickly. I am not sure where to start in asking my questions or if I even<br/>\nknow yet what to ask. <br/>\n The best I have gotten was LLL when my oldest was young and I met a<br/>\ncouple of moms that had children older than mine that seemed so calm.<br/>\nWhen I went to talk to them for ideas I was told that LLL stand was no<br/>\nspanking but their personal stand was they did occassionally because they<br/>\nfelt no spanking  had not worked.  for their family.<br/>\n  I thought that this list was strictly unschooling but one poster shared<br/>\nthat there was more to it.<br/>\nWe have 4 children 15,14,7,&5....I am still learning and while I feel<br/>\nlike I have learned some things (from experience) a new day dawns and I<br/>\nstart all over.<br/>\n  Are there moms here that have never spanked and had great results? And<br/>\nmoms that started out spanking and stopped by  learning better ways? If<br/>\nso what did you read or do to get to that point? <br/>\n  In groups at homeschool meetings I have heard conversations about<br/>\nsomeone in the group not spanking. The gist of it was &quot;oh,they don&#39;t<br/>\nspank...you can see that it doesn&#39;t worklook how ill behaved the child<br/>\nis.&quot;<br/>\n  I sense from this list that there are parents that are misunderstanding<br/>\nnot spanking like they misunderstand unschooling. It is not doing nothing<br/>\nbut learning what to do when? Like Sandra has shared lots of ways to give<br/>\nchoices or to (for lack of a better word *please forgive the wording*)<br/>\ntrain children without harshness.<br/>\nParents go through difficulties with behaviour whether they spank or<br/>\nnot...is it because some parents do nothing that brings about the<br/>\nnegative feedback?

Yes, I&#39;ve found that my idea of unschooling is <br/>\ndifferent from most posters here. I see unschooling as an educational choice, <br/>\nnothing more or less. All of this other about it being a way of parenting, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t agree with. Sure, most unschoolers choose to respect their children, to <br/>\ngive them freedom of choice in all areas, to put their rights above all else, <br/>\nbut to me those are parenting choices, not unschooling choices.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo can you see why we are saying &quot;that&#39;s not respectful to children&quot; and you <br/>\naren&#39;t getting it?<br/>\nAnd why it seems ludicrous when you say that you only hang out with, and are <br/>\naround people that are respectful to children when most parents are NOT.<br/>\nYour definition of respect is not one that is accepted by most members at <br/>\nthis list.<br/>\nAnd therein lies the crux of the problem I think.<br/>\nMaybe you ought to get the feel of the views here before trying to convince <br/>\nother people that your views are just as valid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you&#39;ve been living on your own since you were 15 Myranda?<br/>\nI think your life has been rougher than you want to admit, and by comparison <br/>\nyour home is respectful of children.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t do a whole lot of thinking and changing and <br/>\ntry to understand the DEEP level of respect that is being discussed here.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1512150,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;peggy@...&gt;","profile":"margotapple","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] re: sigh","postDate":"1035479335","msgId":47734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQjgyOTI3LjkwQzJGNzE2QGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDI0MTQyNDM4LklHV1M5MzE4Lm91dDAxNi52ZXJpem9uLm5ldEBbMTI3LjAuMC4xXT4="},"prevInTopic":47705,"nextInTopic":47744,"prevInTime":47733,"nextInTime":47735,"topicId":47705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So, I apologize for<br/>\nthe generalization. And, I too have met older moms who had aged but not grown<br/>\nin emotional strength. I think that finding that balance takes some time in a<br/>\nperson&#39;s life and in our culture many of the young people, because their needs<br/>\nare usually NOT respected, tend to go though years of reacting against what<br/>\nhappened to them when young rather before moving on and developing the degree<br/>\nof emotional health and intelligence that a child needs from a parent. I think<br/>\nso many of them are young because it takes time, support, and awareness to<br/>\nwork though the earlier issues and having kids young can put that growth on<br/>\nhold.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"patti.schmidt2@verizon.net","from":"&lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"re: sigh","postDate":"1035469478","msgId":47705,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDI0MTQyNDM4LklHV1M5MzE4Lm91dDAxNi52ZXJpem9uLm5ldEBbMTI3LjAuMC4xXT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47734,"prevInTime":47704,"nextInTime":47706,"topicId":47705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I think you are a young and a bit overwhelmed by having three kids by age, is it 25 or less?
