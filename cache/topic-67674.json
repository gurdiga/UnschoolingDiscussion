IF you or anyone have any good suggestions there, let me <br/>\n<br/>\nknow!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is a pirates coloring book put out by either Dover or Bellerophon <br/>\nthat&#39;s pretty great!<br/>\nThere are Treasure Island movies galore.  You could just put them on for the <br/>\npictures and he could wander in and out but stay for the battles and other <br/>\ngood parts and ignore the boring dialog about maps and Bibles and innkeepers, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSites about lost treasures, and recovered treasures would be fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most serious yet embarrassing pirate studies is England during the <br/>\nage of exploration, Elizabethan days, when &quot;letters of marque&quot; were given to <br/>\nships&#39; captains who were exempt from being charged with theft if they stole <br/>\nfrom Spanish or Portuguese ships returning from the new world with gold and <br/>\nother good stuff.  England didn&#39;t have to cross the sea, they just waited <br/>\nuntil the Spanish got in range.  The Queen got a cut.  The BIG cut, I think, <br/>\nand the captains got rank and privilege.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pirates of Penzance is on video, attractively done, with Kevin Klein, <br/>\nAngela Lansbury, Linda Ronstadt.  That&#39;s fun, and a good intro to Gilbert & <br/>\nSullivan while you&#39;re at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67616,"nextTopicId":41725}}
