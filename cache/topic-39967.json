We take the learning of spoken English so casually and yet look<br/>\nat how difficult it is to learn a foreign language formally! The only reason<br/>\nwe think reading needs some high powered explanations is because schools<br/>\nteach it -- and don&#39;t do a good job at it either! So that makes it sound<br/>\nlike it&#39;s *really* hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut schools teach foreign languages too -- and don&#39;t do a very good job at<br/>\nthat either. Whereas your daughter picked up English all on her own as a<br/>\nside effect of living and I bet has done a fabulous job at it! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you just plainly state what<br/>\n&gt; different words sound like, or do you actually explain &#39;why&#39;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t sound like the book explains why either. It just attempts to draw<br/>\na pattern out of the chaos of English. That&#39;s the way we all learn. We take<br/>\nin input and naturally draw patterns from it and from that devise rules. But<br/>\nthe patterns the book presents probably won&#39;t be the same patterns she would<br/>\npull out and definitely -- since the patterns won&#39;t be in context -- have<br/>\nthe same meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, as you&#39;ve done helping her speak English, just tell her what the<br/>\nword is and she&#39;ll naturally figure out patterns and rules as she acquires<br/>\nmore and more words. That discovery is really the fun part! It&#39;s an<br/>\nadventure because you never know what surprising thing you&#39;ll stumble on.<br/>\n:-)  It&#39;s a mystery or detective story. Phonics books just skip the story<br/>\nand tell you who did it. How interesting is that? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she gets curious about the inconsistencies in spellings you can mention<br/>\nthat every language has it&#39;s own spelling rules but English has words from<br/>\nall over the world. So every word carries a bit of history inside and tells<br/>\nyou of its travels, like words that spell the f sounds as &quot;ph&quot; and the k<br/>\nsound as &quot;ch&quot; are from the Greek, &quot;ough&quot; probably means Old English.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean she won&#39;t enjoy the book or that it would be &quot;dangerous&quot;.<br/>\nShe might think the patterns they show are really neat. She might like to<br/>\nlook at the pictures. Don&#39;t worry about her doing it &quot;right&quot;. Just let her<br/>\nenjoy. Or not and move onto something else she does enjoy :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2197","postDate":"1028655539","msgId":39976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlhLjI5OWU3MTI0LjJhODE2M2IzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39967,"nextInTopic":39983,"prevInTime":39975,"nextInTime":39977,"topicId":39967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/6/02 10:31:54 AM, kevden@webtv.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-163387269\">In a message dated 8/6/02 10:31:54 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevden@...\">kevden@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; How about why the &#39;oa&#39; in boat, doesn&#39;t sound out that<br/>\nway, but instead the &#39;oa&#39; makes an &#39;oh&#39; sound?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When two vowels go walking<br/>\nthe first one does the talking.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd tell her there are exceptions to that too!  <br/>\nAnd a later vowel (either immediately or after a consonate) usually makes the <br/>\nvowel &quot;longer&quot; (say its name).<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly heard another one on TV, on Between the Lions:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When two vowels stand side by side,<br/>\nThe first one says its name with pride.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was in &quot;vowel boot camp,&quot; she says.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Am I making too much of all this?

She has already learned the 26 basic letter sounds.  She did<br/>\nthis back when she was about 2 1/2!  She was an early talker, and very<br/>\nverbal and very interested in letters and words.  We&#39;ve been reading<br/>\nwith her since she was a baby and now, must read an average of 10-15<br/>\nbooks a day (by her request!).  I&#39;ll catch her &#39;reading&#39; to her dolls<br/>\nand stuffed animals.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now she&#39;s very into rhyming.  Em makes up songs and rhymes the<br/>\nending sentences (and will make up a nonsense word to rhyme if she can&#39;t<br/>\nthink of a &#39;real&#39; word&#39; :)  Anyway, she notices that some words that<br/>\nrhyme are spelled similarly, and some words are spelled differently<br/>\n(like cream and seem, for example).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to you all (regarding helping her learn &#39;sounds&#39;) is how do<br/>\nyou explain (once they understand and are sounding out the basic 26<br/>\nsounds) all those other sounds?  Like, this morning she was sounding out<br/>\na book she&#39;d picked up, A Trip to the Pond.  First she sounded out<br/>\n&#39;p-o-n-d&#39; and exclaimed POND!  Then she did the same with &#39;trip&#39;.  But<br/>\nthen she sounded out &#39;to&#39; and of course &#39;to&#39; doesn&#39;t say &#39;tuh&#39; &#39;ah&#39;...it<br/>\nsays &#39;tuh&#39; &#39;oo&#39;.  I&#39;m looking for ideas in HOW to explain these<br/>\ndifferences.  How about why the &#39;oa&#39; in boat, doesn&#39;t sound out that<br/>\nway, but instead the &#39;oa&#39; makes an &#39;oh&#39; sound?  I think Em is looking<br/>\nfor some guidance, and I&#39;m unsure of how to explain it to her.  <br/>\nAm I making too much of all this?  Do you just plainly state what<br/>\ndifferent words sound like, or do you actually explain &#39;why&#39;?  That&#39;s<br/>\nwhy the book reading reflex seemed attractive.  They use the ideas of<br/>\nsound pictures, which seemed easier to comprehend for kids that the way<br/>\nI&#39;d learned..   For example, they say that the letter &#39;o&#39; has many<br/>\n&#39;sound pictures&#39;....the _sound_ &#39;oe&#39; as in &#39;toe&#39; can also be spelled as<br/>\n&#39;oa&#39; as in &#39;boat&#39;, &#39;ough&#39; as in &#39;though&#39;, &#39;ow&#39; as in &#39;tow&#39;. But anyway,<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling like I could use some guidance and suggestions.  I&#39;m<br/>\nfloundering!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling like if I can help her understand the basics (which she<br/>\nseems to grasp very easily) that she&#39;ll love reading and be a great<br/>\nspeller, which will, in turn help her on the road to learning anything<br/>\nshe wants...  But is this a &#39;correct&#39; assumption?  Or am I still too<br/>\nhung up on thinking that she &#39;needs&#39; to know these basics to become a<br/>\ngood reader and speller???<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nDenise</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40011,"nextTopicId":39704}}
