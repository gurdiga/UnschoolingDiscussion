Jayn (5) finds various ways to get a lot of<br/>\nphysical activity in every day, including running around the pool of the<br/>\napartments, climbing on the exercise bike, dancing, yoga and sofa jumping,<br/>\non those days when we aren&#39;t getting to a park, dance class, or swimming<br/>\n(summer). However the days when we do get out give her much more action and<br/>\nphysical release. The stuff she comes up with are a kind of stop gap<br/>\nmeasure. In poor weather we go to indoor playgrounds sometimes, or malls, or<br/>\ngo puddle jumping. My dh and I were discussing recently that the area of<br/>\nphysical activities is our greatest lack, so that Jayn had to make up for<br/>\nour inadequacy with her own devised games. It seems like she is modeling<br/>\nbeing physically active for us instead of the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the archives you can read about our peculiar sleep pattern, in which our<br/>\nschedule travels around the clock. I mention this because we have about 5 or<br/>\n6 nights every five weeks where we are on a night shift. Jayn and I are<br/>\nperforce isolated in the house with the additional need to be less physical<br/>\nat night for noise reduction (2nd floor apartment). I know that she<br/>\nsometimes has frustrations from the lack of big physical activities, and<br/>\nwhen we first &quot;emerge&quot; on the other side of the schedule (getting up at 3AM)<br/>\nJayn will push herself to stay awake for a long day at the park to get lots<br/>\nof extra sun and exercise. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The TV<br/>\nchannel I have the hardest time with is Cartoon Network, with its endless<br/>\ncommercials for the latest Barbies and action figures and Tickle Me<br/>\nElmos.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Disney Channel, as compared to Toon Disney, has no ads for products<br/>\nother than Disney DVD&#39;s, movie promos, other shows, and &quot;public service&quot;<br/>\nsegments that feature kids following their passions. Jayn loves them. I&#39;m<br/>\nlucky because she also loves the Disney shows, and doesn&#39;t care for the<br/>\nanimation styles prevalent at Cartoon Network. Probably the only show on<br/>\nthat channel she tolerates is &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot;, and she prefers the books.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I get up around 7<br/>\nand make breakfast and feed the family before Moira has to get on the bus at<br/>\n8:20.  Lauren and Rowan continue watching TV until 10 or so, when my husband<br/>\nsays it is his turn for the TV.  Lauren and Rowan play as they wish in the<br/>\nliving room or upstairs in the bedrooms (rarely, but it does happen).<br/>\nNoontime is lunch time, then Lauren goes down for her nap (and Rowan too, if<br/>\nshe hasn&#39;t already taken one).  Lauren usually wakes up between 2 and 3 and<br/>\nhas a snack then plays in the living room while my husband is still watching<br/>\nTV.  At 4, Moira gets home from school, they have a snack and get the TV<br/>\nagain until 5 or 6.  They take turns between Noggin (for Lauren) and PBS<br/>\n(for Moira).  Then they go upstairs to play until suppertime because they<br/>\nare driving me bonkers by being loud and rambunctious.  After supper they<br/>\neither loaf in the living room or go upstairs again to play or clean their<br/>\nrooms or take a bath.  Then at 7:30 I put them to bed again.

My name is Judy and I was homeschooled from<br/>\ngrades 3 through 8, then I went to public school for high school.  I always<br/>\nwanted to homeschool my children, but I feared having the same lack of<br/>\nsocial activity that I had when I was young.  My mom had no car during the<br/>\nday and we lived way in the boonies, so our whole life was pretty much spent<br/>\nat home.  I am finally getting over that fear and looking into taking my<br/>\nchildren out of public school.  I have four children, three of whom live<br/>\nwith me.  My oldest is Cait, she is 8 and in 3rd grade and lives with her<br/>\nfather.  My second is Moira who is 5 and in kindergarten.  Next comes<br/>\nLauren, who is 2 and is receiving therapy for a speech delay.  Not language<br/>\ndelay, just speech.  She will start in the public preschool in April when<br/>\nshe turns 3 and will be taking advantage of the special ed she can get<br/>\nthere.  My baby is 12.5 months old and rather young for me to worry abuot<br/>\nher education right now.  Moira loves kindergarten, so I am a little<br/>\nhesitant to take her out.  I am very glad that she has gone to public school<br/>\nthis year because she now has friends, which she didn&#39;t before she started.<br/>\nShe is reading very well, much better than I thought she could until I<br/>\nrealized she was actually reading _Put Me In The Zoo_ instead of reciting<br/>\nit.  Moira is very smart, and very sociable, and I want nothing to hold her<br/>\nback, including me and my own limitations.  We are on very, very limited<br/>\nresources, and I don&#39;t want her to lose out on anything because we can&#39;t<br/>\nafford to take her/get it for her/etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to my questions.  This may seem like such a basic concept, but I am<br/>\nhaving trouble grasping it.  I know that school is mandated so that children<br/>\nare prepared to enter the adult world, and that many who dropped out of<br/>\nshool before it was mandated (i.e. my granparents&#39; generation when it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuncommon to drop out of school at 6th or 8th grade to go to work) struggled.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want my children to struggle like that.  How is unschooling<br/>\ndifferent from simply dropping out of school?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond: Due to the fact that we are on state assistance to survive until my<br/>\nhusband finds a job, how can I maximize my children&#39;s exposure to new and<br/>\ninteresting things?  Until he starts working again, we do have a car, but we<br/>\nalso have to budget our gas.  Obviously, going to the theater is out of the<br/>\nquestion.  When I was young, we raised goats and my mom had a garden.  But I<br/>\ncan&#39;t offer those right now because we live in an apartment in the middle of<br/>\ntown.  I can&#39;t even send my children outside to play in the yard because<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t one.  We have cable and they are allowed to watch quite a bit of<br/>\nit, but I limit which stations they can watch.  I also have the internet<br/>\n(obviously) and I let them play on it when they like.  They tend to mostly<br/>\nvisit the Noggin, PBS and Nick Jr websites and play the games they find<br/>\nthere.  I also take them to the library regularly and take advantage of<br/>\ntheir free programs.  We were also quite active in the SCA for a couple of<br/>\nyears, but money had a way of running thinner and thinner so we can no<br/>\nlonger afford to go to events.  Also, the size of our family has required<br/>\nthat we find a trailer if we wish to go to any over night events.  The<br/>\nchildren love the SCA and were upset when we told them we had to take this<br/>\nyear off.  I feel that it is depriving them of an awesome environment, but<br/>\nwe just can&#39;t do it this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been slowly perusing Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, but there is a lot there,<br/>\nso it will take me a while.  If my questions are answered on one of those<br/>\npages, please direct me there.  I have been wracking my brain trying to<br/>\nfigure out why your name is so familiar, but I just can&#39;t find it.
