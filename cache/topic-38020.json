The women are sitting<br/>\non a bench watching. Eventually, they begin to talk.<br/>\nW1: Hi. My name is Maggie. My kids are the three in<br/>\nred shirts -- helps me keep track of them.<br/>\nW2: (Smiles) I&#39;m Terri. Mine are in the pink and<br/>\nyellow shirts. Do you come here a lot?<br/>\nW1: Usually two or three times a week, after we go to<br/>\nthe library.<br/>\nW2: Wow. Where do you find the time?<br/>\nW1: We home school, so we do it during the day most of<br/>\nthe time.<br/>\nW2: Some of my neighbors home school, but I send my<br/>\nkids to public school.<br/>\nW1: How do you do it?<br/>\nW2: It&#39;s not easy. I go to all the PTO meetings and<br/>\nwork with the kids every day after school and stay<br/>\nreal involved.<br/>\nW1: But what about socialization? Aren&#39;t you worried<br/>\nabout them being cooped up all day with kids their own<br/>\nages, never getting the opportunity for natural<br/>\nrelationships?<br/>\nW2: Well, yes. But I work hard to balance that. They<br/>\nhave some friends who&#39;re home schooled, and we visit<br/>\ntheir grandparents almost every month.<br/>\nW1: Sounds like you&#39;re a very dedicated mom. But don&#39;t<br/>\nyou worry about all the opportunities they&#39;re missing<br/>\nout on? I mean they&#39;re so isolated from real life --<br/>\nhow will they know what the world is like -- what<br/>\npeople do to make a living -- how to get along with<br/>\nall different kinds of people?<br/>\nW2: Oh, we discussed that at PTO, and we started a<br/>\nfund to bring real people into the classrooms. Last<br/>\nmonth, we had a policeman and a doctor come in to talk<br/>\nto every class. And next month, we&#39;re having a woman<br/>\nfrom Japan and a man from Kenya come to speak.<br/>\nW1: Oh, we met a man from Japan in the grocery store<br/>\nthe other week, and he got to talking about his<br/>\nchildhood in Tokyo. My kids were absolutely<br/>\nfascinated. We invited him to dinner and got to meet<br/>\nhis wife and their three children.<br/>\nW2: That&#39;s nice. Hmm. Maybe we should plan some<br/>\nJapanese food for the lunchroom on Multicultural Day.<br/>\nW1: Maybe your Japanese guest could eat with the<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\nW2: Oh, no. She&#39;s on a very tight schedule. She has<br/>\ntwo other schools to visit that day. It&#39;s a<br/>\nsystem-wide thing we&#39;re doing.<br/>\nW1: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Well, maybe you&#39;ll meet someone<br/>\ninteresting in the grocery store sometime and you&#39;ll<br/>\nend up having them over for dinner.<br/>\nW2: I don&#39;t think so. I never talk to people in the<br/>\nstore -- certainly not people who might not even speak<br/>\nmy language. What if that Japanese man hadn&#39;t spoken<br/>\nEnglish?<br/>\nW1: To tell you the truth, I never had time to think<br/>\nabout it. Before I even saw him, my six-year-old had<br/>\nasked him what he was going to do with all the oranges<br/>\nhe was buying.<br/>\nW2: Your child talks to strangers?<br/>\nW1: I was right there with him. He knows that as long<br/>\nas he&#39;s with me, he can talk to anyone he wishes.<br/>\nW2: But you&#39;re developing dangerous habits in him. My<br/>\nchildren never talk to strangers.<br/>\nW1: Not even when they&#39;re with you?<br/>\nW2: They&#39;re never with me, except at home after<br/>\nschool. So you see why it&#39;s so important for them to<br/>\nunderstand that talking to strangers is a big no-no.<br/>\nW1: Yes, I do. But if they were with you, they could<br/>\nget to meet interesting people and still be safe.<br/>\nThey&#39;d get a taste of the real world, in real<br/>\nsettings. They&#39;d also get a real feel for how to tell<br/>\nwhen a situation is dangerous or suspicious.<br/>\nW2: They&#39;ll get that in the third and fifth grades in<br/>\ntheir health courses.<br/>\nW1: Well, I can tell you&#39;re a very caring mom. Let me<br/>\ngive you my number--if you ever want to talk, give me<br/>\ncall. It was good to meet you.<br/>\n--Author unknown<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shelly G&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shellyrae00@...\">shellyrae00@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 02, 2002 10:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] School mentality<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have to share with you folks something that happened<br/>\n&gt; over the past few days on another yahoo list I belong<br/>\n&gt; to (organic gardening).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Someone mentioned they were starting a community<br/>\n&gt; learning center, and I had just read an article about<br/>\n&gt; on in Pennsylvania, so I posted information and the<br/>\n&gt; link to their site. Nothing else, just stated I was<br/>\n&gt; happy to meet another homeschooler, and asked how old<br/>\n&gt; her children were, real innocuous stuff....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Someone else on the group posted a scathing letter<br/>\n&gt; about how ridiculous homeschooling is, and her bottom<br/>\n&gt; line was that children have to learn to toe the line,<br/>\n&gt; submit to authority, and people like me who think<br/>\n&gt; their children don&#39;t have to follow the rules are<br/>\n&gt; ruining their children, etc., etc.  .... oh, and of<br/>\n&gt; course the socialization thing :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow! You know, I&#39;ve talked to lots of people who were<br/>\n&gt; unaware of the insufficiencies of the school system (I<br/>\n&gt; used to be one of them), but I never really thought<br/>\n&gt; about people who KNEW that compulsory schooling serves<br/>\n&gt; to indoctrinate children into a life of obedience and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;toeing the line&quot; and actually WANT that for their<br/>\n&gt; children!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, a million things went through my mind about how<br/>\n&gt; to respond to this person, but I really don&#39;t think<br/>\n&gt; that an organic gardening list is the appropriate<br/>\n&gt; place for it. So I told her I thought that it&#39;s ok for<br/>\n&gt; some people to send their children to public schools<br/>\n&gt; and some people to homeschool their children. I told<br/>\n&gt; her that I agree that both produce a different result,<br/>\n&gt; and that I&#39;m quite sure which result I want for my<br/>\n&gt; children.  I also told her I&#39;d be glad to discuss it<br/>\n&gt; further off-list, but she hasn&#39;t responded to that<br/>\n&gt; invitation yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid this was my first contact with a rabid<br/>\n&gt; anti-homeschooler.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyone else met up with the likes of that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Shelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; =====<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can<br/>\nchange the world; indeed, it&#39;s the only thing that ever does.&quot; -- Margaret<br/>\nMead<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Aren&#39;t you worried<br/>\n&gt; about them being cooped up all day with kids their<br/>\n&gt; own<br/>\n&gt; ages, never getting the opportunity for natural<br/>\n&gt; relationships?<br/>\n&gt; W2: Well, yes. But I work hard to balance that. They<br/>\n&gt; have some friends who&#39;re home schooled, and we visit<br/>\n&gt; their grandparents almost every month.<br/>\n&gt; W1: Sounds like you&#39;re a very dedicated mom. But<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; you worry about all the opportunities they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; missing<br/>\n&gt; out on? I mean they&#39;re so isolated from real life --<br/>\n&gt; how will they know what the world is like -- what<br/>\n&gt; people do to make a living -- how to get along with<br/>\n&gt; all different kinds of people?<br/>\n&gt; W2: Oh, we discussed that at PTO, and we started a<br/>\n&gt; fund to bring real people into the classrooms. Last<br/>\n&gt; month, we had a policeman and a doctor come in to<br/>\n&gt; talk<br/>\n&gt; to every class. And next month, we&#39;re having a woman<br/>\n&gt; from Japan and a man from Kenya come to speak.<br/>\n&gt; W1: Oh, we met a man from Japan in the grocery store<br/>\n&gt; the other week, and he got to talking about his<br/>\n&gt; childhood in Tokyo. My kids were absolutely<br/>\n&gt; fascinated. We invited him to dinner and got to meet<br/>\n&gt; his wife and their three children.<br/>\n&gt; W2: That&#39;s nice. Hmm. Maybe we should plan some<br/>\n&gt; Japanese food for the lunchroom on Multicultural<br/>\n&gt; Day.<br/>\n&gt; W1: Maybe your Japanese guest could eat with the<br/>\n&gt; children.<br/>\n&gt; W2: Oh, no. She&#39;s on a very tight schedule. She has<br/>\n&gt; two other schools to visit that day. It&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; system-wide thing we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n&gt; W1: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Well, maybe you&#39;ll meet someone<br/>\n&gt; interesting in the grocery store sometime and you&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; end up having them over for dinner.<br/>\n&gt; W2: I don&#39;t think so. I never talk to people in the<br/>\n&gt; store -- certainly not people who might not even<br/>\n&gt; speak<br/>\n&gt; my language. What if that Japanese man hadn&#39;t spoken<br/>\n&gt; English?<br/>\n&gt; W1: To tell you the truth, I never had time to think<br/>\n&gt; about it. Before I even saw him, my six-year-old had<br/>\n&gt; asked him what he was going to do with all the<br/>\n&gt; oranges<br/>\n&gt; he was buying.<br/>\n&gt; W2: Your child talks to strangers?<br/>\n&gt; W1: I was right there with him. He knows that as<br/>\n&gt; long<br/>\n&gt; as he&#39;s with me, he can talk to anyone he wishes.<br/>\n&gt; W2: But you&#39;re developing dangerous habits in him.<br/>\n&gt; My<br/>\n&gt; children never talk to strangers.<br/>\n&gt; W1: Not even when they&#39;re with you?<br/>\n&gt; W2: They&#39;re never with me, except at home after<br/>\n&gt; school. So you see why it&#39;s so important for them to<br/>\n&gt; understand that talking to strangers is a big no-no.<br/>\n&gt; W1: Yes, I do. But if they were with you, they could<br/>\n&gt; get to meet interesting people and still be safe.<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;d get a taste of the real world, in real<br/>\n&gt; settings. They&#39;d also get a real feel for how to<br/>\n&gt; tell<br/>\n&gt; when a situation is dangerous or suspicious.<br/>\n&gt; W2: They&#39;ll get that in the third and fifth grades<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; their health courses.<br/>\n&gt; W1: Well, I can tell you&#39;re a very caring mom. Let<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; give you my number--if you ever want to talk, give<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; call. It was good to meet you.<br/>\n&gt; --Author unknown<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Shelly G&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shellyrae00@...\">shellyrae00@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 02, 2002 10:49 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] School mentality<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have to share with you folks something that<br/>\n&gt; happened<br/>\n&gt; &gt; over the past few days on another yahoo list I<br/>\n&gt; belong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to (organic gardening).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Someone mentioned they were starting a community<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learning center, and I had just read an article<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on in Pennsylvania, so I posted information and<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; link to their site.
