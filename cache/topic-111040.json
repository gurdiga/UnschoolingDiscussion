Every day at 11  and 5 <br/>\nthe ducks leave their palace on the roof, enter the elevator, and walk the  <br/>\nred carpet into the marble fountain in the hotel lobby.  It&#39;s quite an  <br/>\nattraction.  They are handled by a &quot;duckmaster&quot;, which is a sought after  position, <br/>\nbut pretty much held for life.  There&#39;s a kids book about the  ducks and large <br/>\ncrowds gather every day to see them come down.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.peabodyhotelgroup.com/pages/ducks_\">http://www.peabodyhotelgroup.com/pages/ducks_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.peabodyhotelgroup.com/pages/ducks)\">http://www.peabodyhotelgroup.com/pages/ducks)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nHow did the tradition of the ducks in The  Peabody fountain begin? Back in <br/>\nthe 1930s Frank Shutt, general manager of The  Peabody, and a friend, Chip <br/>\nBarwick, returned from a weekend hunting trip to  Arkansas. The men had a little <br/>\ntoo much Tennessee sippin’ whiskey, and thought  it would be funny to place some <br/>\nof their live duck decoys (it was legal then for  hunters to use live decoys) <br/>\nin the beautiful Peabody fountain. Three small  English Call ducks were <br/>\nselected as “guinea pigs,” and the reaction was nothing  short of enthusiastic. <br/>\nThus began a Peabody tradition which was to become  internationally famous. The <br/>\noriginal ducks have long since gone, but after more  than 70 years, the marble <br/>\nfountain in the hotel lobby is still graced with  ducks. Today, the mallards <br/>\nare raised by a local farmer and friend of the hotel.  The ducks live in the <br/>\nfountain until they are full grown and, on retirement from  their Peabody <br/>\nduties, are returned to the wild. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Peabody ducks?","postDate":"1136763328","msgId":111047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzQzFBMUMwLjgwMDAyMDBAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJjMC4zMDE2MjZkLjMwZjJmMTNmQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDJjMC4zMDE2MjZkLjMwZjJmMTNmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":111046,"nextInTopic":111048,"prevInTime":111046,"nextInTime":111048,"topicId":111040,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
