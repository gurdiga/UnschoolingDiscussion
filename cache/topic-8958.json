Yes, under 100 residents. The post offie boxes in the 80&#39;s(all boxes are \nfree, we have no mail delivery). We homeschool 3 children, 10yob, 6yog, 5yog. We \nhave found it to be VERY quiet. Other than that, we have truly enjoyed our \npeace. We are able to walk everywhere, do not fear who our children are running \ninto, and weknow that our house will not be mistaken for ______ (fill in the \nspace- drugs, thieves, drive by target, etc) It is great to leave the windows \nopen all night, the door unlocked when we are in the back yard, or being able to \ntrust the neighbor to not steal whatever is on our porch. The downside to this \nis that the nearest gas/party store is over 6 miles.&nbsp;The nearest grocery \nstore is 33. We don&#39;t go to the store that often, well not anymore:) You are the \noutsider. Here, everyone is great. Friendly, will wave and talk to us, but they \nare still leary.&nbsp;Absolutely NO fast food here...We have a restuarant that \njust opened, other than that, nothing, LOL. I never want to move back to the \nbig&nbsp;city, even when I am bored.. LOL Oh, btw... I come from Philadelphia \n(2,000,000) then lived in Naples, Fl(25,000); Port Huron, MI(50,000); Roscommon, \nMI(840); and now Elk Falls, KS!(80+5)</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"2\">Stephanie&nbsp;</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8832,"nextTopicId":8853}}
