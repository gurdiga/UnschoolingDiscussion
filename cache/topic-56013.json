Very<br/>\nfriendly towards my child and myself and helpful.<br/>\nIf they have any views they keep it to themselves.<br/>\nThis library has been my source as a teacher for<br/>\nmaterials. Everything from documentaries, movies<br/>\nbooks on tape or disc going beyond only bookes.<br/>\nOf course we do it bored, and wish there were <br/>\nsomething new everyweek, but there is still untouched<br/>\ninformatin there on the shelves, I just have to me more<br/>\ncreative.<br/>\nThe public library, if used, is an asset to homeschooling<br/>\nfamilies.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda L.
