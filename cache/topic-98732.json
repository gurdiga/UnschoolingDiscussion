It<br/>\noccurred to me yesterday that the process of unschooling in my life is like<br/>\nthe life cycle of an insect. The egg hatches and the nymph changes slightly<br/>\nwith each moult until it becomes the adult insect.<br/>\n<br/>\n Life over the last couple of years has been one of slow, but constant<br/>\nchange. I reach a place in my growth where I am able to shed an old habit or<br/>\nmindset completely and start afresh with a new concept until that too<br/>\nbecomes a part of who I am rather than something I am putting into practice<br/>\nand slowly I am becoming a new person and yet I&#39;m still me. I know my kids<br/>\nare benefiting from this and they are the reason I began this journey but<br/>\nalong the way I found myself. so thanks guys! It&#39;s kinda cool to be able to<br/>\nbe free  to be me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Mia had her breakfast for lunch and her lunch for breakfast and<br/>\nshe wore her pyjamas all day. We went to my Mum&#39;s briefly at 1pm and on the<br/>\nway she turned to me (shoeless, wearing her nightie and weighed down by<br/>\npencils and paper) and said, &quot;Mummy, I&#39;m having a happy day.&quot; And I thought,<br/>\nme too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week I&#39;ve been able to see I have still been quite controlling with<br/>\nwhat she wears and I have realized I could relax a little more with the food<br/>\nand I posted a positive affirmation in my kitchen above the workbench. It&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;I choose this moment to be patient with others.&quot; It&#39;s almost miraculous how<br/>\neasy it has made it for me to be patient. Maybe it is just knowing that it<br/>\nis my choice not a have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were moments, many of them, last year when I thought I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nable to do it. I found the TV irritating and would be upset if the kids<br/>\nwanted to watch it rather than do something with me. I really made it a<br/>\ncompetition in my head between me and the box. I realized I was being<br/>\nunreasonable and just accepted the choices they were making and now I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally notice how much it&#39;s on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe house is noisier but more peaceful and there is so much understanding<br/>\nbetween us. I think it&#39;s trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is glorious!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98653,"nextTopicId":98646}}
