I&#39;ve been thinking back to so many instances where I made dumb mistakes, and I am STILL beating myself up for it!!! (and on a regular basis!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIts only been the last 2 weeks that I finally decided that its really ok; that I was really just young and inexperienced, and there was no way I could be held to the perfectionistic standards that certain people (including me) had.  I&#39;ve only just come to realize that most people *do* make stupid mistakes as they learn, not just when they&#39;re young, but at all ages.<br/>\nI just didn&#39;t know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first time in my life, I&#39;m actually forgiving myself for stupid mistakes I made 20 years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am beginning to think that perfectionists have an intense fear of failure.  In my experience, they often take pride in their perfectionism, and believe it makes them superior, but they don&#39;t realize how destructive it is to dismiss the value of mistakes and the growth that comes with them.  Their perfectionism is all they have to define themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they hold others to their unrealistic standards, its because they believe that non-perfectionism (Realism) is a character flaw that reflects directly on them.  Its a threat to the quality of their personhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I&#39;m trying to set firm boundaries for myself so that I&#39;m done paying interest on mistakes I&#39;ve made in the past and prevent paying for today&#39;s mistakes for the next 20 years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want anyone to suck me down while I climb out of this hole.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105977377,"authorName":"Alison Broadbent","from":"Alison Broadbent &lt;abzb@...&gt;","profile":"tttrrrsz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re : exhastion","postDate":"1084901683","msgId":94260,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDQ0Y5NzQyLjcyQjclYWJ6YkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94267,"prevInTime":94259,"nextInTime":94261,"topicId":94260,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One thing that has helped me in uncomfortable situations is finding out why it bothers me.  I ve seen that if, in the situation, people were bringing up issues","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-87353848\">One thing that has helped me in uncomfortable situations is finding out why<br/>\nit bothers me.  I&#39;ve seen that if, in the situation, people were bringing up<br/>\nissues that I wasn&#39;t sensitive to, it wouldn&#39;t bother me.  If someone says<br/>\nsomething about me that I know in my core is not true, it doesn&#39;t have any<br/>\nresonance.  But if somebody says something that I&#39;ve got unresolved stuff<br/>\nabout, it effects me intensely.  So since I&#39;m kind of a control freak and I<br/>\nrealized this was an area I could actually have some control over, I&#39;ve<br/>\ndived in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being in a class as an adult where everybody had been there for<br/>\nabout a year before I joined. There was a woman who was the queen bee and<br/>\nkept everybody else around her.  There wasn&#39;t much room for me to form<br/>\nrelationships with others which was what I usually would do in a place like<br/>\nthat.  She would make plans with everybody in the class but not include me.<br/>\nShe wouldn&#39;t even look at me when talking to all of us at breaks.  If I said<br/>\nsomething, she would ignore it. I didn&#39;t want to leave the class bc the<br/>\nteacher was fantastic.  I tried to get in one of his other classes but they<br/>\nwere all full so I was stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started thinking about what this all brought up for me.  And it was<br/>\nhow it was when I was a preteen.  I was lonely and didn&#39;t have good friends<br/>\nand felt so awkward and ashamed.  Never mind that in HS I had lots of<br/>\nwonderful friends, this is the time that informed lots of who I was.  Or who<br/>\nI was afraid I was.  When I really let that sink in and feel all those lousy<br/>\nthings again with  my older and wiser and more compassionate self as the<br/>\nvessel, I was able to be in that situation without that discomfort.  I was<br/>\nable to get out of the class what I needed and leave the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do any of that without meditation helping<br/>\nme to disconnect from the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94248,"nextTopicId":94263}}
