But it&#39;s NOT a consequence. A consequence of <br/>\nnot washing the dishes is no clean dishes for the next meal (or eating at a <br/>\nrestaurant! &lt;G&gt;) No computer time is a punishment---whether self-inflicted or <br/>\nimposed by the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat many of us are saying is that, if allowed to THINK about the situation <br/>\nand be a part of the solution---as opposed to being given orders and <br/>\naccepting punishments, children will gladly and joyfully be your partners.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the bike-riding. You&#39;ve just given us excuses WHY you can&#39;t be the <br/>\nfirst one at the stop sign. There&#39;s an underlying problem that has NOTHING to <br/>\ndo with biking. If your child won&#39;t stop at the sign, it&#39;s NOT because he has <br/>\na bike---there&#39;s something deeper there. Your getting angry and taking away <br/>\nhis bike doesn&#39;t TEACH him that he must stop at the stop sign. What he&#39;s <br/>\nLEARNED is that you&#39;re controlling him and enjoying the taunts he receives <br/>\nfrom his friends. Put yourself in HIS shoes. He&#39;s seven; you&#39;re the adult. <br/>\nHow would YOU feel? Might you stop next time? Maybe (maybe not), but what <br/>\nhave you learned? Compassion? Understanding? Reason?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s seven.<br/>\n<br/>\nYOU said you were a bad mother.
