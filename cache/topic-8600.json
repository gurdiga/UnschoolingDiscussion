Key information from each<br/>\nmajor topic is captured in one of the 11 songs provided on cassette tape.<br/>\nAlso includes a 43 pp. workbook with application questions and an answer<br/>\nkey.

My son *loves* to learn anything that is set<br/>\n&gt; to music.  I downloaded the Multiplication Rock songs and he<br/>\n&gt; listens to them and sings them around the house.  I found a<br/>\n&gt; website that has science songs and put some in a folder for him.<br/>\n&gt; He discovered them a few days later and came downstairs telling<br/>\n&gt; me about kinetic and potential energy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been trying to find more things like this, but keep coming<br/>\n&gt; up empty.  I am not trying to bombard my son with this, by the<br/>\n&gt; way.  It&#39;s sort of like with food.  It&#39;s there for him, and when<br/>\n&gt; he is hungry he will &quot;forage&quot; for it.  I am just trying<br/>\n&gt; to gather these resources so I have them or know where to find<br/>\n&gt; them. Any suggestions?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Renee<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online<br/>\n&gt; reservations.
