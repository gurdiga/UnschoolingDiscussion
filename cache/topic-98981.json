Teen Kids News can be seen weekly on<br/>\nover 200 stations nationwide. Our on-camera anchors and reporters are a<br/>\ndiverse team of tween and teen journalists reporting from a<br/>\nprofessional news set. The aim of Teen Kids News is to deliver the news<br/>\nin a kid friendly voice, explaining stories without talking down to our<br/>\naudience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are looking to present a story about the Home Schooling. We are<br/>\nlooking to interview a parent who is a home schooler and home school<br/>\nactivist as well as his or her child about Home School. We are looking<br/>\nfor a well spoken high school aged child. We want our audience to learn<br/>\nmore about what Home School is, and what it is like to be home<br/>\nschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would like to shoot this story sometime in September. We are able to<br/>\ndo this interview in the New York Metro area only, and would ask for 45<br/>\nminutes to set up, an hour of interview time for each the parent and<br/>\nchild and additional time for B-roll. We would send a three person<br/>\ncrew—producer, camera and audio. Our audience is 12-18 year old kids.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98973,"nextTopicId":98957}}
