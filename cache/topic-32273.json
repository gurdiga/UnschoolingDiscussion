You go girls!!  It irks me so much to hear others say &quot;If you require anything of you kiddos you are not a true unschooler&quot;  as if its a cult in which you must abide by the letter of the law or be excommunicated.  I for one have required the same things from my girls that Helen mentioned in her email simply because we all are part of making this family and household run smoothly.  If I did otherwise I would run myself ragged just to keep up with daily chores and give my girls the attention they often ask for with their various projects.  So far our simple requirements have proven successful and I do not intend on changing until it no longer works for our family.  There with that said, I am happy to be numbered among you wonderful gals!
