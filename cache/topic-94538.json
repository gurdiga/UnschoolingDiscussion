We got it at Home Depot, it was by the painting supplies.  I don&#39;t remember the name but I would think they could find it.  It was kind of expensive, around 10 to 15 dollars per can, but really easy to use.  It should tell you how much you need on the back of the can, be careful,it goes really fast.  Hope that helps a little!  My youngest colored on the wall of our new house every time he could find something to draw with, lasted a few weeks.  Getting  chalkboard paint for one of the walls in his room helped with that anyway.  We painted a large chalkboard on the lower part of the wall, gave him chalk, and told him to please only decorate his wall!<br/>\n                                           Good Luck,<br/>\n                                                  Linda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
