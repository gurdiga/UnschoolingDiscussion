As we read it we found they<br/>\nhighlighted the fact that he was homeschooled, but then they added that he<br/>\nhad an A average. He never wrote a grade on this, we don&#39;t grade anything<br/>\nhere, never did as we don&#39;t believe in grades. I was peturbed that they did<br/>\nthat, but then I realized that they probably have very little first hand<br/>\nknowledge of how many ways there are to hs.
