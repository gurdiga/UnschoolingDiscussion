My son is <br/>\nonly going to be 3 this year, so I obviously have some time to <br/>\ndecide.  I already know I do NOT want him to go to preschool, which <br/>\nis a strange thing in this neighborhood, apparently.  That is what <br/>\nstarted me on this information-gathering quest.  =)  I guess we <br/>\nunschool already, as he has learned his ABC&#39;s, counting to 20, <br/>\ncolors, shapes, etc as well as some Spanish just by playing and <br/>\nreading books and watching TV and such.
