I am!  That&#39;s the main thing I try to communicate to the<br/>\nkids everyday, but other than Sarah, the 10 yo, they are still just<br/>\ntoo ego-centric to have any real empathy outside of how it will<br/>\naffect them.  (ie:  If mom&#39;s feeling happy, she won&#39;t yell.)  Just<br/>\nhearing someone recognize that I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed helps.  Thank<br/>\nyou so much Robyn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a couple of practical suggestions. One thing that I do when<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I want to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; yell is hug Jayn or blow a zerbil (raspberry) onto her instead. We<br/>\n </span></blockquote>then end<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; up giggling, and the problem tends to become a lot smaller.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This reminds me alot of the &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; advice I&#39;ve read<br/>\nabout, and I&#39;m trying to get better at this.  It&#39;s hard for me not<br/>\nto just react sometimes, but I will keep trying.  I remember being<br/>\nso much more relaxed and playful with my older son when he was<br/>\nlittle.  I was so much younger and less stressed out, I guess.  He<br/>\nwas easy and there was only one of him.  Now I am having trouble not<br/>\nfeeling resentful, guilty and tired-out.  I do have moments when I<br/>\nam being very mindful in my interactions with my children, where I<br/>\nfeel true compassion for them and remember that they are young and<br/>\nlearning, and my love for them flows easily and abundantly.  At<br/>\nthose times, I can more easily figure out what they need and I am<br/>\nmore creative in my efforts to help them. I just wish I could be<br/>\nthat mindful and peaceful more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Perhaps you could try getting some occasional help in tidying from<br/>\n </span></blockquote>an<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; outside source - a mother&#39;s helper, a local teen intermittently,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or perhaps<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you could actually employ your daughter for a specific task for a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>specific<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; time frame. I would suggest that this be outside of any allowance<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; already receives. I think it could be tough for her to be seen as<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;mature&quot; child, and expected to take on caretaking of the other<br/>\n </span></blockquote>children or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; their messes - after all she had no choice in the matter of<br/>\n </span></blockquote>acquiring<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; siblings presumably.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sarah is very helpful, actually, because she plays with the girls (3<br/>\nand 4 yo) so much, but I don&#39;t want to take advantage of her for the<br/>\nvery reasons you mention.  I&#39;m quite money poor at the moment, so I<br/>\ncan&#39;t pay her that way, but I do reward her in other ways (she<br/>\ncollects shells and when I find a particularly nice one, I give it<br/>\nto her as a thank you.  I also spend time with just her after the<br/>\nkids go to bed, even when I&#39;d just rather be alone.  She enjoys<br/>\nthis, I think (as do I most of the time!)  I will say that she is<br/>\nevery bit as messy as they are if not more so.  She is her mother&#39;s<br/>\nonly child, and is only with me temporarily.  Her mother has never<br/>\nexpected her to clean up after herself and is very relaxed about<br/>\nclutter.  (how I wish I could be that way at times!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, part of the reason I&#39;m feeling so overwhelmed is because<br/>\nsince Sarah has been here, my four year old, Stella, wants to do<br/>\nnothing but play with her big sister.  When I ask her to help me<br/>\ntidy her room for instance, she answers, &quot;No.  I&#39;m playing with<br/>\nSarah&quot; in a really snotty voice.  This really ticks me off<br/>\nsometimes.  Her attitude towards me is so ugly when her sister is<br/>\nhere.  So, I guess there is a tradeoff in having Sarah&#39;s help.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One thing that some folks use is to spread out a large groundsheet<br/>\n </span></blockquote>on which<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to do art work or puzzles.

This assumes<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; children are done with the project and don&#39;t mind it getting put<br/>\n </span></blockquote>aside in a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; higgledy piggledy manner.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read about doing this before, but forgot--thanks.  I could do<br/>\nthis in the patio area of the house we are in, and actually we<br/>\nalready do use the patio for particularly messy art.  The huge patio<br/>\nis enclosed, the floors are concrete and since it still has much of<br/>\nthe owners construction mess in it and isn&#39;t a place where I want to<br/>\nhang out, I don&#39;t really care what the kids do in it.  They have<br/>\nbeen painting in there and playing with chalk.  I even let them just<br/>\nleave the paints out and I periodically check and see if the brushes<br/>\nneed caring for, etc...  This is huge for me!  My natural tendency<br/>\nis to nag them about taking care of their things, and to put<br/>\neverything in it&#39;s place again.  :)  A drawback to the patio is that<br/>\nit isn&#39;t heated, and we live on the Washington coast where it often<br/>\ngets chilly even in summer.  I suppose we could put a space heater<br/>\nin there for those days, although it&#39;s huge and un-insulated, so<br/>\nthat could be expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel badly about banishing them from the house to play.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t asked them how they feel about it, though.  If we spruce up<br/>\na particular area with shelves for their puzzles and supplies, it<br/>\ncould be their very own baby-free play-space!  They may go for that<br/>\nand if they have some say in how it&#39;s set up, they&#39;ll really be<br/>\nhappy.  It could be a new project!  Especially with dad coming--he<br/>\ncould help by building the shelves or whatever. I know they want to<br/>\nfind a mutually agreeable solution to the problems we&#39;ve been<br/>\nhaving.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Rather than trying to baby proof the whole house or restrict the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>older ones<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in their activities to one place, perhaps you can make a &quot;safe<br/>\n </span></blockquote>room&quot; or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fenced off area for the baby to be mobile and free in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Believe me, this would be a wonderful option, except the floor plan<br/>\nin this house prevents it, unless I wanted to gate him inside one of<br/>\nthe bedrooms, which I wouldn&#39;t do.  He likes to be a part of the<br/>\naction too much and I wouldn&#39;t be able to supervise him.  As it is,<br/>\nhe really screeches when all the girls are outside and he can see<br/>\nthem through the sliding glass door or the low window, but can&#39;t go<br/>\nout himself because I&#39;m busy inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In terms of things on their beds - I would try the idea of picking<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; battles initially - obviously the long term idea is to not have<br/>\n </span></blockquote>any battles.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Their rooms should be their rooms, and not held to the same<br/>\n </span></blockquote>standard as the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; public or shared areas of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tend to agree with and strive for this, even though I have trouble<br/>\nwith it (I hate going into their room to help them dress or tell<br/>\nthem bedtime stories, only to step on and break a toy that was<br/>\nhidden under some clothes on the floor--it hurts and they&#39;re out<br/>\nanother toy!)This is something I have been specifically working on.<br/>\nIn fact, I privately decided to ignore the mess in their room--just<br/>\nlet it be however they wanted it.  I succeeded for about 36 hours!<br/>\nI just couldn&#39;t stand that clean and dirty clothes were left all<br/>\nover the room, along with puzzle pieces(all mixed together willy<br/>\nnilly) and library books (I have to point out damage to a book<br/>\nnearly every time I return them to the library!) and markers and<br/>\npastels, etc...  Besides the fact they can&#39;t possibly enjoy their<br/>\nthings if they are lost, hidden or broken, the house doesn&#39;t belong<br/>\nto me and I don&#39;t want them ruining the (unfortunately)white carpets<br/>\nwith art supplies.  (An acquaintance is renting this house to us<br/>\nVERY CHEAPLY because we are experiencing some financial hardship<br/>\nright now, and I really don&#39;t want her to regret helping us out.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since you have recently moved, you may not have yet joined up with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>your<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; local homeschool group.

It took<br/>\nme a long time to post here for help and support.  I&#39;m glad I did,<br/>\nbut as usual, I&#39;m embarrassed by admitting my inability to cope, and<br/>\nalso by the fact that when I do start talking, I REALLY unload.  I<br/>\nconstantly worry that I&#39;m so needy that I will just drive people<br/>\naway.  I also have the fear of having to be there for yet another<br/>\nperson--even a friend. (Does this make sense?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSheesh, I am a mess.  I&#39;m sorry this is so long, and I hope I don&#39;t<br/>\nsound like I&#39;m finding excuses to not try the things you mention.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just that I try all the time and just seem to continually fail<br/>\noverall.  I do really appreciate your comments and suggestions.  I<br/>\njust need more.  Maybe the main help I need is in breaking my<br/>\nreactive habits.  How do you go from a very verbally reactive person<br/>\nto one who takes a few moments to calm down before she speaks or<br/>\nacts?  How do you change for good, and not just for days or<br/>\nmoments?  Practice, I guess?  Any ideas?<br/>\n--- End forwarded message ---</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93606,"nextTopicId":94466}}
