Poor gal don t ya just hate trying to explain what ya mean LOL I think I do understand what you re saying :) Hope I can be of a little help ... ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1397440361\">lol ... Poor gal don&#39;t ya just hate trying to explain what ya mean LOL<br/>\nI think I do understand what you&#39;re saying :) Hope I can be of a little<br/>\nhelp ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\nDo you all have a list of chores that you expect your children to <br/>\ndo?  <br/>\n=========<br/>\nI personally do not have a list of chores but if you are wanting to earn<br/>\nmoney for them,<br/>\nthey know they can come to me and deal on the issue ... for instance my<br/>\ndaughter is into dragonball z<br/>\nbut I will not buy the stuff for her (videos etc) so she came to me and<br/>\nasked if she did the kitchen<br/>\nliving room everyday etc ... could she earn a video a week?  ($3 a day -<br/>\nsure!)<br/>\nWhen she stopped, I started picking it back up and she just didn&#39;t get the<br/>\nmoney anymore,<br/>\nbut I never made an issue out of it ...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as their bedrooms - If I am having special company, I inspect every<br/>\nroom prior to their arrival<br/>\nand they need to be perfect ... other than that ... as long as there is no<br/>\nfood in the room and &quot;garbage&quot;<br/>\nis thrown into the garbage can, not left in the room, I feel that is their<br/>\ndomain and I let them keep it<br/>\nhow they want ... They are pretty neat kids, (NOW - never used to be lol)<br/>\nand choose to keep<br/>\nthings pretty orderly most of the time ... If I notice it is getting a bit<br/>\nridiculous, I will throw in<br/>\na &quot;maybe we should get this cleaned up so you can find what you are looking<br/>\nfor etc ...&quot;<br/>\nBut normally it is never an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n====================<br/>\nDoes the loose or non-existant &quot;control&quot; of <br/>\nthe child&#39;s education STOP when it comes to their responsible <br/>\nparticipation in the everyday running of the family household?<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\nNo - flexibility in educational issues does not reflect on other areas of<br/>\ncommon living.<br/>\nBut this depends on the parent - some may be flexible in everything ...<br/>\nsome may not be.<br/>\nWe are a team - teams play together, work together - etc so they can enjoy<br/>\nlife together.<br/>\nWhen I look up the definition MOM in the dictionary, it doesn&#39;t give me a<br/>\nlist of things<br/>\nI have to do just because I am a mom - I birthed you but there are five of<br/>\nus in this house<br/>\nand we can all help to get done what needs done ... we don&#39;t have &quot;set<br/>\njobs&quot; but if I need<br/>\nthe trash taken out, I will do it or will ask someone nearby ... <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you help when asked ... I will enjoy giving you a treat or a break once<br/>\nin awhile - <br/>\nlike $5.00 in quarters for video games when we go to the movies ... or<br/>\nwhatever ...<br/>\nbut if you cop a tude about it or do not do what needs done, then you have<br/>\nearned a No ..<br/>\nand when you ask me to do something - I will cash in my NO ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n====================<br/>\nDo you have consequences when they don&#39;t do their share of the <br/>\nchores?  Do they have tv or stereo taken away?  Are these <br/>\nconsequences consistently enforced?<br/>\n===========<br/>\nYes!  If there is no consistancy, there is no reason to follow<br/>\nas you will constantly be testing to find that line, because it<br/>\nkeeps moving so you are constantly lost!  Wherever you set the lines<br/>\ndon&#39;t move them - when they test these lines, reinforce them.<br/>\nThey have to test - thats their job !<br/>\n<br/>\nI think under certain circumstances we can be mothers of<br/>\ngrace and offer a break but for the norm ... it must always remain<br/>\nconsistant ...  I do not ask much of my kids ... I&#39;m a pretty easy<br/>\nmom to live with but when they see a line - they know it is not<br/>\nworth crossing ,,,  They will not lose their stereo for a day - they <br/>\nwill lose it until they earn it back ... <br/>\n<br/>\nI will listen to their reasoning - and see if grace is justified - but<br/>\nnormally<br/>\nexcuses will not constitute disobeying ... and if it is blatant direspect<br/>\nthen<br/>\nI will let them offer an explanation but there will never be grace ... as I<br/>\nwill not tolerate disrepect.... <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest pushed us so far (prior to beginning homeschooling)<br/>\nthat she ended up having a room that looked like a room from<br/>\na shelter ... it had a bed in it and a lamp and that was it ...<br/>\nshe was given an outfit every day to wear and had nothing<br/>\nelse in there ... makeup - GONE - hair stuff - GONE ... everything- GONE!!!<br/>\nuntil I saw a positive change (mind you, this was a drastic case<br/>\nwhen she disappeared until 2 in the morning so I was up crying<br/>\nand scared until I found her) but I don&#39;t play games ... You blow it -  <br/>\nyou knew ahead of time the consequences - so you decided they<br/>\nwere worth it to be able to do what you wanted to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank the Lord, she never did anything so silly again and we moved<br/>\nfrom the city with the bad influences because of that ... but I was <br/>\nnot giving an inch on it , as I didn&#39;t want it repeated.<br/>\n====================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are, then how does that go back to not enforcing consequences <br/>\nif the child doesn&#39;t do anything &quot;constructive&quot; towards his or her <br/>\neducation during the week.  And I&#39;m sure constructive isn&#39;t exactly <br/>\nthe right word to use either ... that definition and labels issue <br/>\nagain ... but how do you deal with the issue of being permissive in <br/>\ntheir education and not being or being too permissive in their <br/>\nparticipation in the family&#39;s life?<br/>\n==========<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself feel the difference in unschooling and homeschooling is <br/>\nthat you are not breeding a non desire to learn  ... you are creating an<br/>\natmosphere<br/>\nwhere their desire is enlightened enough to think of the things they wish<br/>\nto learn when they are ready.<br/>\nIf I unschool my child and my child is not taking an initiative to learn<br/>\nanything ...<br/>\nthen I as a parent can do one of two things - stand by and watch my child <br/>\nbecome a byproduct of bad parenting - or I can find ways to encourage them<br/>\nand ignite that desire to learn new things...  We are not here to corral<br/>\nthem into<br/>\nlearning a structured curriculum, but it is our job to be sure they receive<br/>\nan education.<br/>\nSo we encourage and spark in them their desire ...  does that make sense?<br/>\n======================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps Kathy :)<br/>\nRita<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n~ Rita ~ of WA<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:into@...\">into@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cpronline.net\">http://www.cpronline.net</a><br/>\nFree Offer For Homeschoolers:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cpronline.net/software.html\">http://www.cpronline.net/software.html</a><br/>\nEverything Homeschool USA Yahoogroup<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Everything_Homeschool_USA\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Everything_Homeschool_USA</a><br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21871,"nextTopicId":21874}}
