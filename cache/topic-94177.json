They sent me to school like everyone we knew at the time, but I always, always was hugged, told that I was loved by both parents, had parents that loved each other deeply and never fought that I can remember (disagreed some, but the discussions never got heated in front of us), provided a home that was rich in books and games and family times, good food, many interesting people coming and going, support in my interests (although like most school parents they pushed the academics as more important) and so on.<br/>\nI was spanked some, but only remember one spanking in my life, I do remember my Mom backhanding me once in sheer frustration, but apologizing very sorrowfully later on.<br/>\nLater, both my parents discussed how sad they were that they ever spanked us, talked to me extensively about childhood wounds and such...I kept thinking &quot;geez, I&#39;m glad they feel bad and all, but it&#39;s no big deal&quot;. So there was deep healing for any wrongs done to me in childhood, and the good SO outweighed the bad moments.
