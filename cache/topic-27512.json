I bought it when I had <br/>\n9 children all at home. Well, most of them are gone now and I&#39;m too busy to <br/>\nbake bread. I&#39;d like to sell this one and buy something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI paid $429 for this. I still have the instructions.  It will hold 8 quarts <br/>\nin the stainless steel bowl.  You can knead of to 23 cups of flour or 7 lbs <br/>\nof flour. Up to 15 lbs of dough, all at one time.  You can buy optional <br/>\nattachments.  This one comes with the standard beater, the dough hook and a <br/>\nhandy scraper to get all the dough from the bottom of the bowl.  I used to <br/>\nmake 6 - 2 lb loaves of 110% whole wheat bread at one time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou add your ingredients, let the mixer knead it.  Put your dough in a bowl <br/>\nto rise or directly into bread pans to rise and then bake. The mess stays <br/>\nin the mixer bowl and is easy to clean up.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see pictures of my machine at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www201.pair.com/patspell/auctionpictures/auctionproducts/dlx1.jpg\">http://www201.pair.com/patspell/auctionpictures/auctionproducts/dlx1.jpg</a>  and<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www201.pair.com/patspell/auctionpictures/auctionproducts/dlx2.jpg\">http://www201.pair.com/patspell/auctionpictures/auctionproducts/dlx2.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The unit similar to the one in this picture  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.magicmillusa.com/\">http://www.magicmillusa.com/</a> <br/>\nand you can see all the parts that are available such as grinders, blenders <br/>\nand such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want $250 for this machine plus $16 for shipping.  Contact me at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pat@...\">pat@...</a> if you are interested.  I would love to take <br/>\npayments but I just can&#39;t.  I need the lump sum to buy a bread machine does <br/>\nthe baking too. Now that I don&#39;t need to bake nearly as much.  It is in <br/>\nexcellent shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*************************************<br/>\nPat Spelling<br/>\nVisit my web site for the perfect gift!!<br/>\nTerry Redlin Collector Plates, Steve Hanks Art, Afghans, Pillows, Teapots & <br/>\nMore!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.redbudtree.com\">http://www.redbudtree.com</a><br/>\n*************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27488,"nextTopicId":27516}}
