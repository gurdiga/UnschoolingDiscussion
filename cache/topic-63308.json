They just are in a transition and healing <br/>\nstage before they can embrace a new idea.  Sometimes they send their kids to <br/>\nschool instead.  Sometimes they unschool.  Sometimes they adopt a different <br/>\nphilosophy.  But I don&#39;t think anyone gives up and doesn&#39;t care anymore.  If <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t care, they wouldn&#39;t burn out. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a Mom like that.<br/>\nShe &quot;homeschooled&quot; by not doing ANYTHING. I suppose being a single Mom and <br/>\nnot working would have put her in the position to be a fabulous unschooler. <br/>\nBut she never did anything with the kids.<br/>\nShe was kind and gentle, but not very aware or interesting.....no passions of <br/>\nher own.<br/>\nHer kids grew up with virtually NO knowledge of the world. Unaware of <br/>\nhistorical events, mathematical concepts etc....<br/>\nI think she really loved her children, and I still think they were better off <br/>\nin that situation than in school BUT she was not an unschooler in my opinion.<br/>\nShe&#39;s close to her adult children, they are kind and well adjusted people, <br/>\nfinding their way in this world and I think they&#39;ll learn anything she didn&#39;t <br/>\nexpose them to in their own time. <br/>\nBut I also think it was educational neglect to just leave them on their own <br/>\nand not be involved in showing more of the world to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.
