(4, 12, & 16) we are making<br/>\nthe transition from homeschooling to unschooling. i have been reading<br/>\nthe unschooling handbook & gave our oldest the teenage liberation<br/>\nhandbook to read as well. i have also been pouring over sandras site &<br/>\nthese boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nwe believe life experience is the BEST teacher. what they learn from<br/>\nus as their parents & their own personal experiences are better than<br/>\nwhat the school system could ever teach them! unschooling has been our<br/>\ndesire the past few months. i still have questions about math. that is<br/>\nthe subject that bothers me most. our oldest is not strong in math. i<br/>\nworry for her future in that regard. she knows her basic math & i know<br/>\ndeep down this is all that matters. why do i worry so much about this?<br/>\nespecially since she is getting closer to age 18. she has no desire to<br/>\ngo on to school. no college or tech school. the girls love to read &<br/>\nwrite so no worries there. our middle girl is quick with math. we dont<br/>\nuse workbooks or textbooks either. never have. we believe they are<br/>\nvery well rounded! both girls tell me often how glad they are to be<br/>\nhome after hearing the horrors of p.s./private school from their<br/>\nfriends & family. they feel they arent missing out on anything special.<br/>\n<br/>\nwe have discussed this many times. the girls want to unschool & i want<br/>\nthem to be happy. so that is the direction we will take. if others<br/>\nhere have EVER been in our position, how did you make the transition<br/>\nto unschooling? how did you let all the fears melt away? i would<br/>\nappreciate hearing about what others have done. thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n*now for a little background info. i hope this makes sense so bear<br/>\nwith me. lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nweve been homeschooling for 7 years. we are happy with the results &<br/>\nare happy all around as a family. We never had any probs with our<br/>\nprevious methods of homeschooling. it worked for us. we used the cmm<br/>\nmethod & we were very eclectic at the time. we have always been close,<br/>\nopen, & honest with the girls. we talk with them & vice versa. we are<br/>\nattentive to their needs & feelings. when our youngest (& not our last<br/>\nchild that&#39;s for sure! lol) was born we unschooled for almost a year<br/>\nbut then went back to homeschooling because the girls missed the<br/>\nstructure i guess. (& so did mum i will admit.) hubby doesn&#39;t mind<br/>\nwhat method or style we use. he is for them being at home bottom line.<br/>\nhe feels what i am doing is right & as long as everyone is happy<br/>\nthat&#39;s cool with him. the girls & i (when hubby is at work or out of<br/>\ntown hunting) together enjoy sharing our interests & just hanging out.<br/>\nwhen hubby is home we do this together.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe girls help around the house without us asking. we do chores<br/>\ntogether. they love to cook/bake & are handy. very mechanically<br/>\ninclined. especially our oldest. there are no bedtimes & hasnt been in<br/>\n7 years! we try not to place too many restrictions on them. we are<br/>\nlooked at in the neighborhood, by our friends, & in the family as very<br/>\n&quot;cool&quot; parents! the ones with the tats who dont conform not to mention<br/>\nthe openness we have with our girls.<br/>\n<br/>\ncurrently we are watching our favorite show babylon 5 (i have the<br/>\nwhole series on dvd-all 5 seasons) in the evenings. usually on mon &<br/>\ntues we (the girls & i) camp out in our bedroom. we love to discuss<br/>\nthe characters & the worlds with their high tech space life. we refer<br/>\nto the books on the show (i have them all. lol!) when we dont get<br/>\nsomething. we watch it every year along with centennial. (which we<br/>\nhave on vhs & a childhood fav of mine!) we tape a lot of our fav<br/>\nsci-fi/fantasy shows & educational shows to watch during the<br/>\nafternoon. hubby is not watching with us this time around cuz he is<br/>\nbusy attending the tech college for his associate degree on mon & tues<br/>\nnights after work. he comes in around 10 p.m. on these nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nsince they were very young we have kept a lot of art supplies, dvds,<br/>\ncomputer & ps2 games, videos, crafts, board games, books, puzzles, &<br/>\nother resources always available for them. we have a big interest<br/>\ntogether in religion/spirituality, history & science fiction/fantasy.<br/>\nlast march we-the girls & i decided to make our very own &quot;spirit<br/>\nbook&quot;. it is an ongoing project! it is filled with religious &<br/>\nspiritual online info & personal info we have found on the net & have<br/>\nwritten ourselves. it is eclectic. we have everything from catholic,<br/>\nchristian topics to paganism topics. there are 3 binders with almost<br/>\n600 pages to date. we often refer to these binders. it is another one<br/>\nof my legacies to our children. the girls even started their own<br/>\nspirit books!<br/>\n<br/>\nwe attend zoos, take trips, go hunting, (oldest) museums, concerts,<br/>\nenjoy nature, & other functions together as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks again to anyone who responds. :) Amethyst</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110219,"nextTopicId":109418}}
