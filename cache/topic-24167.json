Especially the puzzle<br/>\nkind. I&#39;ll play them for hours at a time, resenting<br/>\nthe time I have to stop and go cook dinner or<br/>\nsomething. But when I figure out the whole puzzle or<br/>\nknow that I have gone as far as I can with my<br/>\ncapabilities I stop. Maybe that&#39;s what happened with<br/>\nyour son. He learned all he wanted from it and set it<br/>\naside. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHA!  I too love, oh my gosh- MYST I played that straight through with out even eating- 10 hrs., then ran out and bought the sequel, certain puzzle games.  Also, my son got pokemon game boy game and a game boy one year for x-mas (we had no idea what it was- our tv doesnt work) and he couldnt read it so I read it for him- oh lordy!  We both stayed up some really late nights (once 3 am!) figuring out all the puzzles of it- I was amazed!  such a NEW thing (for me), interactive games!  SO, when ever anyone says they hate that gross pokemon- I ask if they ever played it- and they havent! <br/>\n<br/>\nOh- and it is super boring for me (and my son) after I figured it out.  You know what is fabulous, that ZELDA game boy game- loved it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nBronwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24302,"nextTopicId":24066}}
