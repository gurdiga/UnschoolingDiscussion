I<br/>\nunderstand that you can&#39;t change doctors, since she&#39;s the only one in your<br/>\narea, so this needs a different approach.  How about writing to her, telling<br/>\nher what you had expected, what you got and what you felt about it.  If you<br/>\ncan include info about unschooling and some of the recent stuff posted about<br/>\nliving without qualifications, that will help &#39;educate&#39; her so you and<br/>\nothers don&#39;t come up against this crap from her, and if she&#39;s career-minded,<br/>\nshe might even decide to do a paper on it!  You&#39;re mad as hell right now, so<br/>\nmaybe you can use some of that mad to let her know just how damaging her<br/>\nassumptions are.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps, btw, where in WA are you, I have a friend over there...<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\nnose&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; What, if anything, should I do about this?
