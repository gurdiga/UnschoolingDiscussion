I DO feel as though it is my responsibility to raise my children a certain way AND chastise them. Does that mean that I beat them (even lightly) with a dowel? NO NEVER. Does it mean I do not unschool? I dont think so. Does it mean I can be a unschooler as well as a Christian? I think they CAN mutually exsist. <br/>\nSo speaking as one of THEM, I feel as though your generalization is WAY off base. And really isnt that what all the fuss about to be or not be an unschooler was about?
