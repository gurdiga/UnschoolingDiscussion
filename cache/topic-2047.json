She would always bring home outdated readers<br/>\n&gt; and textbooks or discarded sample copies from publishing companies.  She<br/>\n&gt; swears that she taught me to read when I was 3.  I don&#39;t remember, but I do<br/>\n&gt; know that I was reading fluently when I started kindergarten.  So, already<br/>\n&gt; she is asking me when I am going to start teaching my dd to read.  With my<br/>\n&gt; younger sister, my mother read a book on teaching your toddler to read, and<br/>\n&gt; started working with her using flashcards at the age of 2 or 2 1/2.  So here<br/>\n&gt; comes the confusion -- yes, I want my dd to learn to read, and neither my<br/>\n&gt; sister or I grew to dislike reading because of feeling pressured at an early<br/>\n&gt; age.  But, I can&#39;t help but think that my dd might respond differently and I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t bear to think that I might do something that would decrease the love<br/>\n&gt; that she has of being read to now by forcing her to soon to learn to read on<br/>\n&gt; her own.  I don&#39;t want to sit back and do nothing, but I don&#39;t want to push<br/>\n&gt; too hard and do damage in the long run!  Anyone else been in this dilemma?<br/>\n&gt; For now, my dh and I just read, read, and read some more to her.  And we also<br/>\n&gt; make a point to let her see us reading things that we enjoy on a daily basis<br/>\n&gt; as well.
