It&#39;s treating children with respect, just as you would any other adult. Would I come to your house and tell you that it was 12pm and it was time for lunch? No, not unless I wanted to be kicked out, LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think &#39;unparenting&#39; IMO, is actually a very involved parent.

But with Unparenting,if you take parent out ,what are you left<br/>\nwith?<br/>\nMay be my problem is that I find it difficult to understand how anyone would<br/>\nwant less parenting?  My generation was shoved into day-care, then<br/>\npre-school, then school... My father died mostly a stranger to us. And we<br/>\nare stranger to my mother mostly too. We are fortunate that we can live very<br/>\ndifferently. We live WITH our children. We are not some mythical person,<br/>\nsome days on pedestal others in the gutter. We know each others humanity.<br/>\nParenting is what comes after the chicken and the egg thing.  It&#39;s not a one<br/>\nway relationship.  Rather looks like a very beautiful circle.<br/>\nSorry about the ranting. In some ways one could say that my childhood was<br/>\nabused, robbed of a natural relationship with adults around me. But<br/>\nreversing the flow of a linear thinking make no sense either. We need to<br/>\nbridge the gap, close the circle.<br/>\nWho knows may be in time our society could learn to close other circle, and<br/>\nreturn to  some  more appreciative communities.<br/>\nFriendship,<br/>\nLucie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Tia Leschke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 20, 2002 3:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unparenting and TCS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This is how we know it&#39;s spring!
