I wish I had \nknown about homeschooling when I was a child. My mom always had tons of great \nbooks in our house and most of what&nbsp;I really learned back then I taught \nmyself from the materials&nbsp;I had available at home or the library. School \nwas wasted time for me. We have been homeschoolng for three years and&nbsp;I \nrecently discovered unschooling. I have been devouring every bit of \ninformation&nbsp;I can&nbsp;find. My husband doesn&#39;t quite understand yet and is \nafraid our kids will be &quot;left behind&quot; if I don&#39;t push their lessons. (We have a \nten year old reluctant reader). I will be sharing your post with him in hopes \nthat he will learn to trust in his children&#39;s ability to learn what they need to \nbe successful with their lives.&nbsp;Thanks again.</font></div>\n<div><font size=\"4\">Johanna&nbsp;</font></div></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18053,"nextTopicId":17279}}
