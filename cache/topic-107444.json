It&#39;s hard for me to get my hands on comic books (distribution really sucks these days. When I started every corner store ha a rack, now I rarely see them outside a comic book store) but I have coveted the Astonishing X-Men since I saw it in Wizard Magazine. His writing seems fantastic, the art is wonderful and respectful and it&#39;s got Kitty Pryde (whoo hoo!). <br/>\n  But the story arcs and multiple titles are more of the reason why I don&#39;t buy anymore.
