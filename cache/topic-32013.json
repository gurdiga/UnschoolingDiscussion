I&#39;ve forwarded it on to two of my dear friends, <br/>\nKatherine and Colleen, who each lost their husbands within three hours of <br/>\neach other (and at the time, the women didn&#39;t know each other, but the three <br/>\nof us are now extremely fast friends).  There&#39;s more beauty in the <br/>\nworld...read on:<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Kurtis The Stock Boy,,,,God@work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was busily working when a new<br/>\nvoice came over the intercom asking for a carry out at checkout register 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nKurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air, and decided<br/>\nto answer the call. As he approached the check-out stand a distant smile<br/>\ncaught his eye, the new check out girl was beautiful. She was an older woman<br/>\n(maybe 26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to<br/>\nfind<br/>\nout her name. She came into the break room, smiled softly at him, took her<br/>\ncard and punched out, then left. He looked at her card, BRENDA.  He walked<br/>\nout only to see her start walking up the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a<br/>\nride<br/>\nhome. He looked harmless enough, and she accepted. When he dropped her off,<br/>\nhe asked if maybe he could see her again, outside of work.  She simply said<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t<br/>\npossible. He pressed and she explained she had two children and she couldn&#39;t<br/>\nafford<br/>\na baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter. Reluctantly she<br/>\naccepted his offer<br/>\nfor a date for the following Saturday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that<br/>\nshe was unable<br/>\nto go with him. The baby-sitter had called and canceled.  To which Kurtis<br/>\nsimply said,<br/>\n&quot;Well, lets take the kids with us.&quot;  She tried to explain that taking the<br/>\nchildren was not an<br/>\noption, but again not taking no for an answer, he pressed.  Finally Brenda,<br/>\nbrought him<br/>\ninside to meet her children. She had an older daughter who was just as cute<br/>\nas a bug,<br/>\nKurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair.   He was<br/>\nborn a paraplegic<br/>\nwith down syndrome.  Kurtis asked Brenda, &quot;I still don&#39;t understand why the<br/>\nkids can&#39;t<br/>\ncome with us?&quot;  Brenda was amazed.  Most men would run away from a woman<br/>\nwith two<br/>\nkids, especially if one had disabilities. Just like her first husband and<br/>\nfather of her children<br/>\ndid. That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and<br/>\nthe movies.<br/>\nWhen her son needed anything Kurtis would take care of him. When he needed<br/>\nto use the<br/>\nrest room, he picked him up out of  his chair, took him and brought him<br/>\nback. The kids<br/>\nloved Kurtis. At the end of the evening, Brenda knew this was the man she<br/>\nwas going to<br/>\nmarry and spend the rest of her life with. A year later, they were married<br/>\nand Kurtis<br/>\nadopted both of her children. Since then they have added two more kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what happened to the stock boy and check out girl? Well, Mr. & Mrs.Kurt<br/>\nWarner,<br/>\nnow live in St. Louis, where he is employed by the St.Louis Rams and plays<br/>\nquarterback.<br/>\nHe was selected Most Valuable Player of the National Football League this<br/>\nweek before<br/>\nhe leads his team Sunday in the Super Bowl.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to know more of his dynamic testimony read the book &quot;Kurt<br/>\nWarner: The Quarterback&quot;  by Thomas Nelson Publishers<br/>\n<br/>\nSIGNING OFF!

&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The year he died, the roses were delivered to her door.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The card said, &quot;Be my Valentine,&quot; like all the years before.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Each year he sent her roses, and the note would always say,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I love you even more this year, than last year on this day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My love for you will always grow, with every passing year.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She thought, he ordered roses in advance before this day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Her loving husband did not know, that he would pass away.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He always liked to do things early, way before the time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then, if he got too busy, everything would work out fine.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She trimmed the stems, and placed them in a very special vase.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then, sat the vase beside the portrait of his smiling face.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She would sit for hours, in her husband&#39;s favorite chair.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; While staring at his picture, and the roses sitting there.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; A year went by, and it was hard to live without her mate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; With loneliness and solitude, that had become her fate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then, the very hour, as on Valentines before,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the doorbell rang, and there were roses, sitting by her door.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She brought the roses in, and then just looked at them in shock.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then, went to get the telephone, to call the florist shop.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The owner answered, and she asked him, if he would explain,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why would someone do this to her, causing her such pain?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I know your husband passed away, more than a year ago,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The owner said, &quot;I knew you&#39;d call, and you would want to know.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The flowers you received today, were paid for in advance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Your husband always planned ahead, he left nothing to chance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There is a standing order, that I have on file down here,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And he has paid, well in advance, you&#39;ll get them every year.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There also is another thing, that I think you should know,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He wrote a special little card...he did this years ago.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then, should ever I find out that he&#39;s no longer here,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s the card...that should be sent, to you the following year.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She thanked him and hung up the phone, her tears now flowing hard.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Her fingers shaking, as she slowly reached to get the card.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Inside the card, she saw that he had written her a note<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Then, as she stared in total silence, his is what he wrote...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hello my love, I know it&#39;s been a year since I&#39;ve been gone,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I hope it hasn&#39;t been too hard for you to overcome.<br/>\n&gt;
