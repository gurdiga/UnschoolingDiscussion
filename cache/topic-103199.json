She replied to them that she&#39;d talked to someone who told her that since there&#39;s a 30 day deadline for newcomers to enroll in public school, she also had 30 days to register as a homeschooler.  At which point the contact said, &quot;okay, that makes sense -- I&#39;ll send the package to you.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nLet me say, for my sis this is huge -- she&#39;s not the most pro-active of people, and often will take No for an answer.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe&#39;d called the phone voicemail number for a group listed at TNHomeed.com as the Memphis Area Home Educators and reached a recording saying it was a non-published number followed by a busy signal, so she was worried about finding someone.
