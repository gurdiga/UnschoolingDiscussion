And doing equally strange<br/>\nthings like gathering up flowers and putting them inbetween sheets of paper<br/>\nand then putting them in books.  Now, to the NA mind, this person is insane<br/>\n(literally) so they decide to humor him.  They tell him nice stories and<br/>\nthe wilder the stories the happier he is.  Well, with an insane person, you<br/>\nwant at all costs to keep him nice and happy because you never know what<br/>\nmight happen if an insane person is unhappy.  When the &quot;insane&quot; white man<br/>\nleaves, they all have a good laugh about the tall tales he was so happy to<br/>\nhear not knowing that he would go and publish a story saying that these<br/>\npeople believed things like coyote talking to them or that frogs asked a<br/>\n&quot;god&quot; to make their pond larger.  You see they shared their &quot;Grimm&#39;s Fairy<br/>\nTales&quot; with these white men and it came back to bite them as being facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to prison populations, been there done that.  The studies are only<br/>\npart observation but mainly these cute little question and answer sessions,<br/>\nsometimes with the prisoners and sometimes with staff.  Neither of which is<br/>\na very good source of information.  If they want to do an accurate study,<br/>\nthen gather up folks that are out of prison and don&#39;t have an ax to grind<br/>\nor want an excuse to get out of their cell so think the bigger the story<br/>\nthe more time out they get.  They even stand around the yard and discuss<br/>\nwhat stories to tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot legislate &quot;community,&quot; therefore you must have an alternative. <br/>\nReality is that you are not going to rehab the over whelming majority of<br/>\nthese folks and all this time<br/>\nspent talking about it isn&#39;t going to make it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, perhaps one needs to look at a very unpopulate thought on the human<br/>\nconscience and being.  33 1/3% inherited (in your genes), 33 1/3%<br/>\nenvironment (learned behaviors, things that happen to you, school, class<br/>\nmates, friends, family) and 33 1/3% is individual.  Bob (the contract<br/>\nkiller) was studied to death, his family was studied to death.  All the<br/>\nshrinks and so forth were totally baffled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, Bob did have a conscience except when it came to his &quot;work.&quot;  It is<br/>\nfunny because it would be acceptable to be ruthless in your work if you<br/>\nworked on Wall Street but it isn&#39;t when it comes to Bob&#39;s line of work.  If<br/>\nthe banker ruthlessly evicts and forecloses on families, it is &quot;just his<br/>\njob&quot; because he gives to United Way, belongs to Big Brothers, Big Sisters<br/>\nand is a good husband and father.  His conscience is never called into<br/>\nquestion.  And, I gotta tell ya, the banker has destroyed far more lives<br/>\nand &quot;killed&quot; more people than Bob.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, before you go off and hit the tangent road, that is not to say that<br/>\nwhat Bob does is o.k., it is an illustration of our skewed way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, since we don&#39;t have economic equity in the U.S., that argument don&#39;t<br/>\nfly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to substanciation of abuse reports you are talking a very small<br/>\npercentage!  There was a study done which was, of course, immediately deep<br/>\nsixed, in which a bunch of shrinks and social workers decided that they<br/>\nneeded a control group to &quot;prove&quot; that their investigative methodology was<br/>\naccurate.  They brought in their own children and swapped kids and did<br/>\ntheir testing. 100% of the kids in the youngest age group tested &quot;positive&quot;<br/>\nfor at least 3 of 5 points indicating sexual abuse in younger children. <br/>\nWhy, because young children are &quot;led&quot; by non-verbal body language<br/>\n&quot;coaching&quot; by adults and the &quot;need to please&quot; factor.  Also, young children<br/>\ndo not understand the difference between inappropriate touching and<br/>\ntouching of any nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe bottomline is that rehab in a &quot;caring&quot; community has been tried in the<br/>\nU.S. and failed miserably with a less than 3% success rate for violent<br/>\noffenders.  The rehab rate on pedophiles is less than 0.5%.  All this talk<br/>\nis great but do you want to take in one of these folks and rehab them???<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscussion is great but it doesn&#39;t fix the problems.  All these folks<br/>\nwriting books aren&#39;t fixing the problem.  I worked with these folks both in<br/>\nthe prison population and at an acute psych rehab facility.  What I am<br/>\nsaying is not based on opinion but on facts.  I don&#39;t know what the answer<br/>\nis but I do know from first hand knowledge that what is put into print as<br/>\nfacts is just so much pie in the sky and/or pure unadulterated piles lift<br/>\nby bulls by folks that aren&#39;t out to help or fix anything other than their<br/>\nown wallets!  Sells those books, hit the talk circuit, make that money not<br/>\none dime of which goes back into helping to fix the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Joel Hawthorne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jhawthorne@...\">jhawthorne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a small, (both geographically and culturally homogenous society it is<br/>\n&gt; possible to have draconian responses to &quot;criminal&quot; activity.

Cable TV, <br/>\n health clubs, free education, the works. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I know this is a popular conception of prison life but it leaves out a <br/>\nfew of the harsher realities, two major ones being beatings by other <br/>\nprisoners or sometimes guards and rapes.  Should these also be the <br/>\npunishment?  This is the reality of our justice system.  If any of us think <br/>\nabout any of our own children or ourselves for that matter, being sent to <br/>\nprison, I believe THOSE things are the fears that scare us most.<br/>\n    Also, if a child&#39;s life in prison really is so much better than his home <br/>\nlife, isn&#39;t part of the answer to see what can be done to change the home <br/>\nlife?  I haven&#39;t met a kid yet who would rather be in prison for the cable TV <br/>\nor the &quot;health clubs.&quot; <br/>\n    I believe the U.S. responds too emotionally to these issues and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to look at what it would take to truly solve the problems.  I guess <br/>\nthat&#39;s why we have such a huge percentage of our people locked up.  <br/>\n    I am just as capable as anyone else of responding with anger and a desire <br/>\nfor revenge when I hear about horrible things done to people.  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat I would really do if someone hurt or killed someone I love.  I know <br/>\nthere is a part of me that would probably want to kill the person myself.  <br/>\nYet our current laws do not allow that as much as we all might feel that way <br/>\nto some extent because we recognize that it would make our society more <br/>\nviolent, not less violent.  In the same way, I believe that many of the <br/>\n&quot;solutions&quot; the U.S. has now also make our society more violent.  <br/>\n    Here is another thing I think about a lot:  people talk so much about how <br/>\nthese kids should be made to take responsibility for what they do wrong.  But <br/>\nthese kids didn&#39;t just land here from outer space.  When is our sick society <br/>\ngoing to take responsibility for creating an environment which produces the <br/>\nkids they&#39;re complaining so much about?   The previous generations, for all <br/>\nof their own problems and injustices, did not have kids who did these kinds <br/>\nof things.  <br/>\n    Some like to believe that it&#39;s because they beat their kids more and <br/>\n&quot;didn&#39;t put up with this nonsense.&quot;  However, I remember my own grandmothers <br/>\nand neither one were harsh at all.  They were very loving, warm people who <br/>\nwere always willing to talk, to enjoy kids, to help others, to extend mercy, <br/>\nto help their kids with prolblems that the kids didn&#39;t know how to solve.<br/>\n    Too many kids today are left in situations which they have no IDEA how to <br/>\nsolve.  Sure, there are some who do well DESPITE their horrible childhoods.  <br/>\nBut don&#39;t we want to create an environment in which the tendency is to do <br/>\nwell rather than have it be the exception?  Whenever I read about things like <br/>\nthe young boys who pushed the younger boy out of the window because he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t steal for them, the thing comes to my mind is how strange it is that <br/>\njust a few years back when I was living in...wherever....or doing...whatever <br/>\nit was...these kids were just little boys and I wonder what in the world <br/>\nhappened to make them become this way.

One doesn&#39;t have to just take the<br/>\nword of someone making the allegation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for corporal punishment, what can one say?  Human history is a tapestry of<br/>\nviolence, inequity, atrocity, exploitation, mixed in with nobility and<br/>\naccomplishment.  Some of those accomplishments ultimately do not seem like<br/>\npositive developments in retrospect.  The refusal and reluctance of people to<br/>\nlook and think critically at the behaviour of their own parents has more to do<br/>\nwith people&#39;s views on this subject than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen examining the behaviour of normal, good people one needs to look at the<br/>\nlong litany of massively criminal behaviour of whole groups of people.  The<br/>\nNazis experience could not be that easily discounted and it is really only the<br/>\nmost glaring and well publicized example of mass horror by &quot;good normal&quot;<br/>\npeople. The inhumanity of people towards other people is a salient feature of<br/>\nhuman history.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrotting out the aberrant psychopath as an example is always tantalizing.  Of<br/>\ncourse there could be the debate as to just how normal this lovely home really<br/>\nwas. &quot;lovely&quot; homes, and &quot;love&quot; from parents are really topics worthy of very<br/>\ncareful examination.  Normal values leave much to be desired.  &quot;Loving&quot;  normal<br/>\nparents regularly abuse their children out of ignorance of developmental<br/>\n&quot;norms&quot;.  Normal people hit their children and call it love.  To be angry and<br/>\npunish a toddler for trying to explore the world, following an absolute<br/>\ndevelopmental imperative hard wired into the brain is a twisted abuse but<br/>\nhappens regularly. This is from parents who do love their children and have the<br/>\nvery best of intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe contract killer&#39;s normal home life needs to be viewed by people who are<br/>\nable to see the corruption of many normal practices.  It is so facile to<br/>\nexplain away horrifying behaviour by simple &quot;volition&quot;.  A contract killer does<br/>\nnot kill simply because &quot;it was easy and he was good at it and only had to work<br/>\na couple of days a year.&quot;  He lacked a conscience.  How did that happen?  Do<br/>\nyou care how that happened?  Is it preventable?  It is something engendered by<br/>\nthe conditions of his life?  Is it a defective neurological apparatus?  The<br/>\nquestions are there.  Your imo simplistic explanation doesn&#39;t address them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be tidy and much less anxiety producing if human behaviour were just a<br/>\nsimple question of volition.  It isn&#39;t.  Reluctance to look at the intricate,<br/>\nparadox filled, frightening reality doesn&#39;t make it go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a large body of research on prison populations which leads clearly, in<br/>\nan epidemiological fashion to the conclusion that violence in childhood is<br/>\ncommon denominator in that population.  Violence greater than the norm.  Not<br/>\nall prisoners.  Just as people subjected to violence in childhood do not all<br/>\noffend.  There is a direct correlation between the nature of a person&#39;s family<br/>\nand that persons behaviour.  It is predictive on a large scale. There are<br/>\ntrends which can be seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for excuses.  None of the horror in any individual&#39;s life is an excuse for<br/>\nmisbehaviour and offending against others.  It may provide explanations for a<br/>\nperson&#39;s propensity to behave in a given way, it may provide an obstacle to be<br/>\novercome but it is never an excuse.  People choose to do what they do and must<br/>\nbe held accountable. That accountability must be in the context of community if<br/>\nit is to be meaningful.  Punishment does not suffice.  The punishing aspects of<br/>\naccountability must be secondary and coincidental if you want the person in<br/>\nquestion to be truly accountable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we disagree immensely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the discussion is worthwhile.  I think you are mistaken as you must<br/>\nthink I am.  I appreciate your engaging in the discussion nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If prisons and punishment are not a deterent, explain Singapore.
