(If you dig into any of them<br/>\n  you&#39;ll see some mighty disturbing stuff. Not just because it&#39;s spanking, but<br/>\n  because of the need to control and make children behave as they are supposed<br/>\n  to.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s the Jewish and Muslim pages that reference religous writings that I<br/>\n  found on the first screenful:<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pub110.ezboard.com/fgeoparentfrm226.showMessage?topicID=20.topic\">http://pub110.ezboard.com/fgeoparentfrm226.showMessage?topicID=20.topic</a><br/>\n  Spare the Rod?<br/>\n  &gt; Does Judaism advise spanking a disobedient<br/>\n  &gt; child?<br/>\n  &gt; The Bible says yes. The &quot;rebellious son&quot; is to<br/>\n  &gt; be put to death by stoning (Deut. 21:18-21), and<br/>\n  &gt; Proverbs (13:24) teaches: &quot;He who spares the rod<br/>\n  &gt; hates his son.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; But by the talmudic period, these harsh doc-<br/>\n  &gt; trines of parental discipline were replaced with an<br/>\n  &gt; emphasis on kindness and compassion. The Tal-<br/>\n  &gt; mud defines the &quot;rebellious son&quot; out of existence<br/>\n  &gt; (San. 71a), rules that a teacher could punish a<br/>\n  &gt; student at most with a leather shoelace (<br/>\n  &gt; Bava Batra<br/>\n  &gt; 21a), outlaws hitting grown children (<br/>\n  &gt; Mo&#39;ed Katan<br/>\n  &gt; 17a), and declares: &quot;With a child, push away with<br/>\n  &gt; the left hand, and draw near with the right&quot;(<br/>\n  &gt; Sotah<br/>\n  &gt; 47a)-the right hand normally being the stron-<br/>\n  &gt; ger. As a result of these rabbinic teachings, tradi-<br/>\n  &gt; tional Jewish homes were noted for treating their<br/>\n  &gt; children with love and warmth. Still, corporal pun-<br/>\n  &gt; ishment was not eliminated in the traditional re-<br/>\n  &gt; ligious school for boys-the<br/>\n  &gt; cheder-<br/>\n  &gt; in Eastern<br/>\n  &gt; Europe, where teachers often hit their students<br/>\n  &gt; for even minor infractions.<br/>\n  &gt; Modern social science is still divided on the<br/>\n  &gt; question &quot;to spank or not to spank.&quot; In 1996, Dr.<br/>\n  &gt; Murray A. Straus, a professor at the University of<br/>\n  &gt; New Hampshire, and Dr. Robert Larzelere of Boys<br/>\n  &gt; Town began a continuing debate in the journal<br/>\n  &gt; Pediatrics <br/>\n  &gt; on the effectiveness of spanking. Dr.<br/>\n  &gt; Straus argued that many studies, including his<br/>\n  &gt; own, show that spanked children become more<br/>\n  &gt; antisocial and do worse in school. Dr. Larzelere<br/>\n  &gt; challenged Straus&#39;s conclusion, claiming that the<br/>\n  &gt; damaging effects of spanking are true only in cases<br/>\n  &gt; of frequent spanking and of corporal punishment<br/>\n  &gt; of older children. For two- to six-year-olds, he<br/>\n  &gt; wrote, occasional non-abusive spanking (&quot;two<br/>\n  &gt; open-handed swats to the buttocks leaving no<br/>\n  &gt; bruise&quot;) is beneficial as a back-up to time-outs and<br/>\n  &gt; reasoning; when the children turn seven, time-<br/>\n  &gt; outs and reasoning alone-with spanking in re-<br/>\n  &gt; serve-have become so effective that spanking is<br/>\n  &gt; no longer necessary.<br/>\n  &gt; Both sides of the debate agree that spanking<br/>\n  &gt; school-age children is undesirable. As for toddlers,<br/>\n  &gt; nearly half of American parents oppose spanking,<br/>\n  &gt; but, according to Straus, nearly all resort to cor-<br/>\n  &gt; poral punishment on occasion. With the debate<br/>\n  &gt; on disciplining toddlers still unsettled, A good<br/>\n  &gt; Reform Jewish approach would be to err on the<br/>\n  &gt; side of compassion and follow Straus&#39;s advice never<br/>\n  &gt; to spank.<br/>\n  &gt; - William Berkson<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/islam_ap/article.html\">http://www.geocities.com/islam_ap/article.html</a><br/>\n  &gt; It is this attitude of mercy and gentleness which I and many other Muslim<br/>\n  &gt; parents believe forms a major part of Islam¹s compatibility with Attachment<br/>\n  &gt; Parenting. For example, spanking of young children is explicitly prohibited<br/>\n  &gt; according to Islamic law. Use of bad language and intimidation are also alien<br/>\n  &gt; to the Islamic tradition, as the Qur¹an says not to use bad language unless<br/>\n  &gt; one has been ³gravely wronged² and the Prophet never cursed, used bad language<br/>\n  &gt; or insults, and never hit any person, animal, or inanimate object. One of his<br/>\n  &gt; Companions said ³I have never seen anyone more kind to his family than the<br/>\n  &gt; Messenger of Allah.² Practices such as allowing a baby to ³cry it out² in<br/>\n  &gt; order to train it to sleep or eat on a schedule are considered vicious by this<br/>\n  &gt; standard. The Prophet was known to be very sensitive to the cry of babies,<br/>\n  &gt; even shortening the congregational prayer when he heard the babies in the<br/>\n  &gt; mosque crying. He would also lengthen his solitary prayer as his grandson<br/>\n  &gt; played on his back, as he did not want to disturb the child¹s play. These<br/>\n  &gt; small deeds are actually very profound statements of the status of children in<br/>\n  &gt; Islam, as it is prohibited to lengthen or alter the prayer in any way in order<br/>\n  &gt; to accommodate other people such as somebody who may have joined the<br/>\n  &gt; congregational prayer late, yet the Prophet made exceptions for children.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sisters.islamway.com/viewtopic.php?topic=4418&forum=2\">http://sisters.islamway.com/viewtopic.php?topic=4418&forum=2</a><br/>\n  &gt; The father¹s duty is to bring his children up well and to take care of them,<br/>\n  &gt; and hitting may be used as a means of discipline when the situation requires<br/>\n  &gt; that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to<br/>\n  &gt; smack children for not praying when they reach the age of ten, but this should<br/>\n  &gt; be the last resort, when all others have failed, and there should be no<br/>\n  &gt; harshness in the hitting, and we must not hit the face. The father should not<br/>\n  &gt; hit his child at the time of extreme anger, or with a sharp instrument that<br/>\n  &gt; may injure him, or with anything that may break bones, and he should not hit<br/>\n  &gt; him in a place where a blow may be fatal. Brandishing the stick may be more<br/>\n  &gt; effective than actually hitting. The point is that when disciplining his<br/>\n  &gt; child, a father should follow the principle of using the gentlest means then<br/>\n  &gt; the next gentlest; he should not resort to the harshest and most difficult<br/>\n  &gt; means if he can achieve his aim with something that is easier and gentler.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And here&#39;s just the hits from the Christian search:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; CORPORAL PUNISHMENT OF CHILDREN (SPANKING)<br/>\n  &gt; ...
