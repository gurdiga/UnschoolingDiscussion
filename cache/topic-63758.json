That&#39;s not to say there is no casual<br/>\nsex.  But it used to be that there was either married sex or fornication.<br/>\nThen any sex was ok.  Now it seems like there are some shows where it&#39;s all<br/>\nfornication (night time soap opera kinds of stuff) or shows that demonstrate<br/>\nthe wider variety of sex that actually happens in life.  IE, some people<br/>\nwait until they get married, some don&#39;t, some play around, etc.  Shows like<br/>\nBuffy really show how each of those choices affect a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the same way that you&#39;d talk about WHY a person is acting violently, I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s important to talk about WHY a person would choose to be sexual in<br/>\nthat situation.  The balance comes less from what he sees, and more from how<br/>\nyou react to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139092405,"authorName":"wenrom31@aol.com","from":"wenrom31@...","profile":"wldr104","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3258","postDate":"1049914061","msgId":63787,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjYS43MTYxYWJiLjJiYzVjNGNkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":63778,"nextInTopic":63789,"prevInTime":63786,"nextInTime":63788,"topicId":63758,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/9/03 9:39:29 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

I really think that my son would enjoy them, but <br/>\nthey do seem to have an awful lot of sex.  My son is comfortable with what he <br/>\ncan stand in terms of violence, and has no problem changing the channel or <br/>\nforegoing a movie or program because it&#39;s more than he has a tolerance for.  <br/>\nI have never really given him the chance to gauge his preferences regarding <br/>\nsexual content.  Now I feel that I have made a mistake.  Truly, though, there <br/>\nare some things that I would simply not want him exposed to (Howard Stern <br/>\ndefinitely comes to mind), but some shows (Dharma and Greg, Friends, <br/>\nEverybody loves Raymond, etc.) deal with sex in a light and fairly realistic <br/>\nmanner (which is good).  I know that this is more about my own hang ups than <br/>\nanything else, I just don&#39;t want to pass those hang ups on to my son.  Hmm.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this, I guess that I just don&#39;t want to <br/>\nshield him unnecessarily or, on the other hand, be neglectful.
