BUT if we also say that part of<br/>\nunschooling is that we DO NOT require our children to do anything academic unless they<br/>\nwant to (thus child centered learning), BUT we also say that in non-academic realms<br/>\nrequirement is okay (i.e. chores, food, medical care), are the then not separating life<br/>\nand learning?<br/>\nJosefa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":80834905,"authorName":"Josefa Wilson","from":"Josefa Wilson &lt;learning_garden1@...&gt;","profile":"learning_garden1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling","postDate":"1016551932","msgId":32738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDOTc1OUZDLkIwOTQzQjBFQHlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDA1YzQwMWMxY2ViOSRjZDU3MzI4MCQyZjM4YWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":32735,"nextInTopic":32740,"prevInTime":32737,"nextInTime":32739,"topicId":25805,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How far do we push not requiring before we consider ourselves unschoolers?

Functional medicine is best explained by <br/>\ncontrasting it with conventional, clinical medicine. Conventional <br/>\nmedicine is preoccupied primarily with the morphologic changes in the <br/>\norgans and tissues. These changes are assessed with appropriate <br/>\nmethodology leading to the diagnostic determination.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In contrast, Functional Medicine endeavors to detect and recognize <br/>\nenergetic and regulatory disturbances that in medical terminology can <br/>\njustly be labeled functional. Functional disturbances occur when a living <br/>\norganism can no longer adequately compensate in response to irritants. A <br/>\nfunctional, regulatory disturbance takes place. Functional disorders can <br/>\nbe detected early, from the very beginning of the pathological  <br/>\nprocesses. Such disturbances can also be evaluated later on, when the <br/>\nmorphological changes also manifest the disease as well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nalso:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oirf.com/vega/vega.html\">http://www.oirf.com/vega/vega.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1978, Dr. Helmut Schimmel of West Germany originated the third major <br/>\nsystem that was called the &quot;VEGATEST-Method&quot; or VRT (Vegetative Reflex <br/>\nTest). Dr. Schimmel (widely known as the formulator of the &#39;Pascoe Nosode <br/>\nComplexes&#39;) after working eight years within the limitations of BFD had <br/>\nthe ideal combination of qualifications for this task, being both a <br/>\nmedical and dental physician, as well as a true clinician-researcher. As <br/>\nyou know, BFD arose out of dissatisfaction with EAV, and so one could say <br/>\nthat the VEGATEST-Method is the culmination of some thirty years of <br/>\nGerman Electro-Acupuncture development.

Back in those early days, there was no one word to describe the <br/>\nphenomenon of children learning at home, and people spoke about it with a <br/>\nvariety of words and phrases.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, the word unschooling has come to be associated with the <br/>\napproach to homeschooling that John Holt wrote about: homeschooling <br/>\nwithout following a packaged curriculum, homeschooling that follows the <br/>\nchild&#39;s interests, homeschooling with an emphasis on real-life activities <br/>\nrather than worksheets, homeschooling in a way that doesn&#39;t make rigid <br/>\ndistinctions between schoolwork and the rest of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Growing Without Schooling magazine, we don&#39;t see unschooling as a <br/>\nrigidly defined concept or approach. It&#39;s certainly not something you <br/>\nhave to think of as a package. Our advice to anyone reading these <br/>\nquestions is that you don&#39;t have to think in terms of &quot;being unschoolers&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;doing unschooling.&quot; If any of the approaches described here appeal to <br/>\nyou, then by all means take the time to find out more, and adapt what you <br/>\nread about so that it fits your family. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Julie wrote:<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m sorry but if you actually read what John Holt wrote he was most<br/>\n&gt;certainly not describing &quot;school-at-home&quot;.  He wrote over and over about<br/>\n&gt;providing interesting stuff and getting out of the kids&#39; way.  He frequently<br/>\n&gt;admonished himself, in hindsight, for offering any suggestions to the kids<br/>\n&gt;at all.  Think of his examples of the little girl and the typewriter or the<br/>\n&gt;kids and the cuisinaire rods.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please see the entire quote above.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have read no examples by Holt where he wrote about parents requiring<br/>\n&gt;anything.  Perhaps you could point out some that I have missed.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The issue of &#39;requiring&#39; came up when someone suggested that if you <br/>\nrequire anything of your children, then you are not unschooling, <br/>\nincluding chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the burden of proof is to show where Holt suggested that people <br/>\nshould not require kids to do chores.

This I know from looking back, from <br/>\n  looking around, from asking and reading and hearing sad stories of <br/>\n  less-than-optimal situations--stories from adults and children both--and <br/>\n  hearing MANY success stories from current unschooling moms and kids, from <br/>\n  attachment parenting families, and others living consciously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 9/16/01 9:15:53 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; Oh, then I guess the archives added this to message #25013:<br/>\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n  And if the information here is diluted or polluted by non-unschooling<br/>\n  advice <br/>\n  in sufficient measure, then people will still not see unschooling.<br/>\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not welcome, it means it&#39;s not good for this list to <br/>\n  be filled with advice which is not intended to promote unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you are, by your defense, and by pulling this quote,  admitting that you <br/>\n  are guilty of diluting or polluting, then YOU yourself might be saying that <br/>\n  you know what you&#39;re writing isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And your post just before this was NOT designed to encourage the questioner <br/>\n  to continue to pursue unschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n  (Quote to the end:)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I personally believe this:  Nobody&#39;s &#39;approach&#39;  is right for my family<br/>\n  except ours.

I keep us all on<br/>\n  track and moving.  The kids each have different jobs.  Rachel is in<br/>\n  charge of outside stuff for the most part although some of the gardens<br/>\n  are mine.  Jenni is in charge of books (becasue she has read them all)<br/>\n  and a lot of inside stuff.  Wyndham is in charge of making Wyndham grow<br/>\n  up.  When the girls were his age they went through similar albeit less<br/>\n  troublesome phases.  We have a job list and some basic guidelines for<br/>\n  getting the housework done fairly.  But none of that has anything to do<br/>\n  with &#39;education&#39;.  As for learning and schoolwork, our lifestyle is a<br/>\n  little less easy to explain.  I do require that my girls be doing<br/>\n  something.  I have some basic suggestions loosely attached to the<br/>\n  jobslist but they can and often do fly out the window.  Rachel has a<br/>\n  violin she is learning to play and if she is doing that, I&#39;m happy with<br/>\n  it.  If she were vegging out and not doing ANYTHING for a prolonged<br/>\n  period of time, I would worry and check into her allergy and depression<br/>\n  levels.  So the list and the requirement for &#39;something&#39; is more a<br/>\n  medical watch thing than it is about school work.  <br/>\n  But then the dynamics here are a bit odd too.  Rachel and Wyndham (oldest<br/>\n  and youngest) have most of the medical problems and are most physically<br/>\n  active.  The middle one, Jenni, often ends up holding things together and<br/>\n  helping me the most but for anyone looking in from the outside it appears<br/>\n  she is not doing much.  <br/>\n  The so called basic school stuff, math, history, english, etc. are so<br/>\n  meshed into our lives that I can&#39;t even say this is what we do to teach<br/>\n  that.

She<br/>\n  just &#39;is&#39; that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So my best advice is to figure out what works for you.  Don&#39;t try to<br/>\n  assign names to it (because someone somewhere will try to tell you that<br/>\n  that isn&#39;t what you are doing) and just do it and don&#39;t look back.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~   F u cn rd ths u cnt spl wrth a dm! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  If electricity comes from electrons . . .<br/>\n  . . . does that mean that morality comes from morons?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a><br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
