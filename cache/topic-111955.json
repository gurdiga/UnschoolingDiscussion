I joined over a year ago, then went &quot;no mail&quot; for<br/>\na time- I didn&#39;t get radical unschooling then, and it was annoying me to<br/>\nhave people talk about unschooling babies (when I had older children), and<br/>\nto see their opinions and worries getting slammed...primarily, because of<br/>\nthe age of their unschooled children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are 7 and 3- I have been *loving* it at Always Unschooled, but<br/>\nthought I would try again here now that my eldest is nearing the<br/>\n(targetted) aged range at AU.  I think I will enjoy both lists for a few<br/>\nmore years yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it seems I&#39;ve arrived back in the middle of an unschooling babies<br/>\ndiscussion...I think it&#39;s fantastic that people commit unschooling so<br/>\nearly in the peace- I didn&#39;t.  I see now that there are people with tiny<br/>\n(or even unborn) children who do, in fact, understand unschooling better<br/>\nthan I did a year ago, with a school-aged child...so they do belong here<br/>\nas much as I do, with a 7 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, there are some things (potties, etc) that I just don&#39;t feel any<br/>\nneed to hear about at this point in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t recommend Always Unschooled enough, but (personally) what I would<br/>\nlike to read about here, is how unschooling school-aged children is<br/>\npanning out...what people are getting up to each day (new ideas), how<br/>\ntheir children are growing without school, how perspectives have been<br/>\nwonderfully (and forever) changed by their children...that kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShell (in NZ)<br/>\nDS (7) and DD (3)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the list is to provide useful information about unschooling<br/>\nfor anyone sincerely interested in unschooling their children. The intent<br/>\nis to help people move out of their own comfort zones as we critically<br/>\nexamine beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about learning that get in the way<br/>\nof unschooling, and seek a deeper understanding of unschooling and more<br/>\nrespectful relationships with our children.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111947,"nextTopicId":102399}}
