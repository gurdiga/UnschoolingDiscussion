There is no &quot;grade level&quot; you have to <br/>\ntest at, no threshold to meet, no reward/punishment.

There is no mention of grade on the <br/>\nrequirements.  I let my boys pick which &quot;grade&quot; they want to test at.  That <br/>\ngives them more control.  Just relax.

You DO NOT have to give &quot;EOG&quot; tests.   You DO have to <br/>\ngive a standardized test once a year. But, it can be the test of your choice, <br/>\nthe &quot;grade level&quot; of your choice.   You can give your son a first grade test <br/>\nif you want.  And, you do not have to send the results to the state, just <br/>\nkeep them on file &quot;in case&quot; they want to see them for one year.    Many folks <br/>\nare misinformed about requirements of NC for homeschooling.  There are lots <br/>\nof &quot;recommendations&quot; that the state lists, but they are NOT required.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as the yearly testing, per the suggestion another NC unschooler ( <br/>\nHEY PAM!) I give my children a test from a  CD-ROM called &quot;Children&#39;s Skills <br/>\nTest&quot;  You can find them for sale on Ebay all the time, very reasonably <br/>\npriced.  Don&#39;t sweat it.  Actually, NC is a very easy state to homeschool in. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135159937,"authorName":"Cindy","from":"&quot;Cindy&quot; &lt;Cindy0766@...&gt;","profile":"cindy0766","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I am new here and have a few questions..","postDate":"1053521520","msgId":70202,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhZnNwZytoODNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":70204,"prevInTime":70201,"nextInTime":70203,"topicId":70202,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello to all..
