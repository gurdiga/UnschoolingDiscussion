This is a pretty<br/>\nharsh judgment (horrible imo, and why I am writing these posts).<br/>\n<br/>\nBreastfeeding is about the child- it involves breasts nipples mouths skin<br/>\nhands bodies.  Do you think for one second that a child would prefer a fully<br/>\nclothed covered up mother, only the nipple out- himself to be fully clothed,<br/>\ndiapered, nike shoes and all- to an entirely naked mother and baby?<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t a baby prefer to cuddle and pet the other breast, the mom&#39;s<br/>\nstomach, her face, her skin?  The concession is already so much- the<br/>\nexperience is already sacrificed for both the mother and child in public<br/>\n(and for many women, in private too).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we asked the babies, would they want discretion? Would they want their<br/>\nteddy bear instead?  no one seems to complain when a kid wants his pacifier<br/>\nand teddy.  Why are breasts uglier than silky blankets and strollers?<br/>\nBreastfeeding shouldn&#39;t have the power to shock- any more than bottles do-<br/>\nif a mother gets negative attention for nursing- she shouldn&#39;t.  How about<br/>\nwe leave breastfeeding alone, and if we want to figure out if someone is<br/>\ntrying to &quot;disturb others&quot;, pick something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;So if the person is &quot;purposefully&quot; being shocking, then we can think their<br/>\nbody is gross, and be justified in having an attitude against them?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSANDRA:<br/>\nWe can all think what we want.<br/>\nI can be justified in thinking that their shock-value actions are affecting<br/>\nattitudes of many other people toward others who are doing/being/expressing<br/>\nsimilar actions/appearances as the shocker.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who&#39;s seen a really obscene tatoo obscenely displayed might have a<br/>\nworse attitude toward tattoos and tattooed people in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who&#39;s had a motorcyclist cut him off in traffic and then flip him<br/>\noff might be (justifiably?) less tolerant of other motorcyclists for some<br/>\nshort or long time after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\nI use the word &quot;justifiable&quot; as meaning a true reason- as in &quot;justice&quot;.  All<br/>\npeople have good and understandable reasons for doing and thinking<br/>\neverything (my belief).  But not all reasons are &quot;justifible&quot;-<br/>\n<br/>\nBy your argument, if the person who cut us off in traffic where of a certain<br/>\nrace- we<br/>\nwould be justified in being less tolerant of that race for a &quot;short or<br/>\nlong time&quot;. While it is understandable, it is not justifiable.  And we can<br/>\nuse our feelings in situations like this to grow as people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we feel offended in any way by breastfeeding, we can use it to grow in<br/>\nour understanding- till we are not offended.<br/>\n<br/>\nME:-=-I am saying that to give an adult a &quot;helpful comment&quot; about such<br/>\nthings like nursing in public, loud children, etc  - um...lets just say- I<br/>\ncan not imagine what that comment would sound and look like to be truly<br/>\n&quot;helpful&quot;-<br/>\nwe all live in the same society, assuming that you have some information<br/>\nthat they<br/>\ndon&#39;t about common attitudes and then giving it to them is condescending and<br/>\nshows faulty boundaries.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSANDRA:<br/>\nWhat if you&#39;re the manager of the Kinko&#39;s, or it&#39;s your house, or you&#39;re a<br/>\ndeacon in a church or an usher at a wedding?  Still faulty boundaries?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if (as happened to me) the organizer of an event has asked you to speak<br/>\nto someone you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\nIf someone asked me to go tell a breastfeeding woman to move- the first<br/>\nthing I would do is feel a pain in my heart that I was face to face with a<br/>\nnegative attitude about breastfeeding.  I would express this, and ask who<br/>\ncomplained.  I would then go to talk to that person (maybe it was the person<br/>\nwho came to me) to try to smooth things out, maybe give some information<br/>\nabout breastfeeding while also listening to their understandably negative<br/>\nfeelings.  I would then make it a point to go and show support to the woman,<br/>\nmaybe sit by her, talk to her.  I would do this because I was asked to get<br/>\ninvolved.  I would be greatful for the opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would be the same if I were the manager of Kinko&#39;s etc..and people felt<br/>\nI had responsibility for fixing their problems, and complained to me about a<br/>\nnursing mother.  Except if I was the manager of kinkos- I might be prompted<br/>\nto put up a sign on the front that said, &quot;nursing mothers welcome&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSANDRA:<br/>\nThere ARE realities and sometimes there are honest and real reasons to try<br/>\nto persuade people to act differently in a particular time or place.<br/>\n<br/>\nME:<br/>\nRight.  For me, however, there is never a situation where I would want to go<br/>\nagainst what I think is right to appease someone&#39;s sensibilities.  I would<br/>\nnever<br/>\ntell a woman to stop or move while breastfeeding because someone asked me<br/>\nto, even if I was &quot;boss&quot;- even if she was flashing alot of skin- and even if<br/>\nshe MEANT to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all babies six months old- only 6% are nursing in this country- that is<br/>\nquite a minority.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us support them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we can avoid trying to figure out if a mom is trying to &quot;get<br/>\nattention&quot; with nursing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we can enjoy the fact that when you see a mother and child nursing you<br/>\nare whitness to a very special, important, and short time in a child&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nthat is all I want to say,<br/>\nBronwen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] re: breastfeeding in public","postDate":"1063954224","msgId":80890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Ni4xZjRkNGU2My4yYzljMDEzMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":80887,"nextInTopic":81033,"prevInTime":80889,"nextInTime":80891,"topicId":80887,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/18/03 11:51:21 PM, felesina@cwnet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-730982375\">In a message dated 9/18/03 11:51:21 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:felesina@...\">felesina@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If a person feels a defensive desire to &quot;shock people&quot; with breast feeding,<br/>\n<br/>\nit is because they are aware of the intense contradiction between our<br/>\n<br/>\nculture and what is normal for human beings - and haven&#39;t worked through to<br/>\n<br/>\na positive way of expressing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you can summarize the motives of all people that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are just obnoxious and like to get attention, negative or <br/>\npositive.<br/>\nSome people honestly LIKE disturbing other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some people like that.
