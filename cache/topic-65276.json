I work<br/>\nf/t for my IL&#39;s in the family business, and my husband does as well,<br/>\ndepending on what&#39;s needed. And he is also a musician, recording engineer<br/>\nand computer genius (He&#39;s also been building our new  house for the past 6<br/>\nmonths). My husband stays home with Matthew and when that&#39;s not possible,<br/>\nthen Matthew is able to come to work with me. He either helps unpack stock.,<br/>\nplays on my computer or sometimes he plays outside with the neighbouring<br/>\ncafe&#39;s grandson. He&#39;s always welcome to come to the store or stay at home.<br/>\nWe feel very fortunate that our employment opportunities have worked out so<br/>\nwell for our family. I always knew it would be me who would work outside the<br/>\nhome (my dh has a rare form of md that can make it difficult to work), and<br/>\nyet didn&#39;t want to be away from my son so much. This is like the best of<br/>\nboth worlds. And my IL&#39;s have been very supportive of us<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling in the best way we see fit.

I don&#39;t think home/unschooling is right for every family.  I think <br/>\nit&#39;s best, but unfortunately, there are parents who feel they don&#39;t have <br/>\noptions and , sadly, there are those who aren&#39;t interested.  I have an aunt <br/>\nwhose children are in ps&#39; and she loves it.  She feels like my children are <br/>\nmissing out on so much.  I feel like my cousins are missing out on so much, <br/>\ntoo, though.  I also have a friend that &#39;wants&#39; to homeschool and has been <br/>\nasking me all sorts of questions about unschooling.  The way she sees it, <br/>\nunschooling would *fit* for her because she is so lazy.  (HER words, NOT <br/>\nmine!)  Se just doesn&#39;t get it.  Another friend tried homeschooling but was <br/>\nso military about it that she drove her kid away.  That child is now in ps <br/>\ndoing better than ever.  I don&#39;t necessarily think it is the best situation <br/>\nfor her, but compared to being home with her mother, it is ideal.  Sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;THAT said, oh, I hope schools do change, even at least a little away from <br/>\n&gt;&gt;the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>extreme standardization that&#39;s happening now.  It has nothing to do with <br/>\nwhat<br/>\nkids need, and it&#39;s all political, and SO sad.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS sad.  Very unfortunate.  In Texas, our ps&#39; have thrown out the TAAS <br/>\ntest for a much more difficult test.  Just about any teacher asked will tell <br/>\nyou these kids are not prepared.  The teachers have no choice other than to <br/>\nteach to the test.  Recess and lunch times are being cut in half, and some <br/>\nrecess periods are cut completely, as are physical education classes.  It <br/>\ntook two years of public schools to convince me that it is the last place my <br/>\nchildren will ever learn anything other than how to perform on a test.  Yet, <br/>\nso many bright children never DO learn how to perform on a test.  Here, they <br/>\nare held back a grade or grades and learn to hate school.  Hate learning.  <br/>\nThey are miserable and let down.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t even have to get into the other issues of ps to know how fast it <br/>\ncan squash any natural learning ability in a child.  The social and <br/>\ninterpersonal ramifications are tremendous.  I know there are people, grown <br/>\nand growing that thouroughly enjoy(ed) ps. I&#39;m willing to bet they all fall <br/>\nat the top of the pecking order or just lucked out and had wonderful <br/>\nteachers, friends and experiences.  Though I am not stating this as fact, by <br/>\nany means.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still believe there is hope.  But not in a public, government mandated <br/>\neducation.
