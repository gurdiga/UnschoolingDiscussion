My family think I&#39;m nuts and <br/>\n  that he&#39;ll just become a drop-out kid. <br/>\n  =====================================================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my first reaction is what in the world could be wrong with this scenario? He wants to &quot;finish&quot; highschool--get his GED, I presume? There can&#39;t be anything wrong there--no burning of bridges. This sounds like unschooling at it&#39;s best to me: your child formed a plan, figured out how to implement that plan, and now he&#39;s asking you to help facilitate that plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Shadow&quot; someone sounds an awful lot like an internship or apprenticeship to me. Again, sounds like a very intelligent thing to do. He&#39;ll find out soon enough if it&#39;s not what he wants to do, and if it is, he&#39;ll be following his own path and passion. What could be wrong with that? <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, there is just no reason for young adults to be forced to do school and bide their time until social standards say it&#39;s acceptable for them to take control of their lives. I lament the passing of the apprentice system in America, though I don&#39;t romanticize it. There were lots of things about it that weren&#39;t all that great when kids as young as seven were sent away from their families to become (often) indentured servants. But we&#39;ve moved so far away from creating a sensible apprentice system that we shuffle kids from highschool to college simply because it&#39;s &quot;what they should be doing.&quot;  We under-value useful, practical trades and over-value a smattering of often useless and unconnected &quot;knowledge.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople often use the plumber example to talk about monetary success: if a person became a plumber straight out of highschool, s/he would likely be in a better position financially than many (if not most) college educated kids who too often come out of school under-trained and seriously in debt. The plumber would have control over his own life, would likely be able to make his own hours and would have a trade that allowed him to work to live, not live to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son sounds like he knows what he wants, has goals for how to get there, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll come up with another plan if this doesn&#39;t work out. He&#39;ll be able to recognize whether he wants to devote the next however many years to learning and practicing this craft without being an indentured servant--either to the blacksmith, society or higher education.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my $.02<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] teen unschooler","postDate":"1075986327","msgId":90281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyMC4yYTAxYzUyOC4yZDUzOTk5N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90280,"nextInTopic":90282,"prevInTime":90280,"nextInTime":90282,"topicId":90280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/5/2004 7:38:32 AM Eastern Standard Time, thestampcellar@yahoo.com writes: My question is...YIKES...what do I do now???
