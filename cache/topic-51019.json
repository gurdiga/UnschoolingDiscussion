First off, games have probably been limited in the past so","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1074280196\">&lt;&lt;just plays video games&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the reason many kids deschool with video games is multi-faceted.<br/>\nFirst off, games have probably been limited in the past so the kids have<br/>\ntime to finish off all their school work OR they have been used as a carrot<br/>\nto try to get kids to finish their school work.  So the kids now have total<br/>\naccess to something that before was limited.  No wonder they binged.  Think<br/>\nback to when access to sugar was scarce.  Society ladies held &quot;sugar<br/>\nparties&quot; where they just binged on sugar, the more the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, kids are (hopefully) going from limited control of themselves to<br/>\nmuch greater control.  In video games, you are pretty much in total control<br/>\n(what &quot;universe&quot; you want to be in, what character, what you do and how long<br/>\nyou do it).<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, its just fun.  For years, us parents have been telling kids that they<br/>\nneed to get used to knuckling down and WORKING, like it is some terrible<br/>\nthing to learn and live your life.  Kids follow the natural instinct to do<br/>\nwhat they enjoy.  Hey, I pretty much just do what I enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, kids are checking to see if you really mean it.  Not necessarily<br/>\nconsciously but checking none the less.  They have been told that they are<br/>\nin charge.  Does that mean that they are in charge even if they make<br/>\ndifferent decisions than you would?  Is this freedom temporary?  For some<br/>\nodd reason, I never make pumpkin pie other than Thanksgiving.  Strangely,<br/>\nthat is also the only time that I ever eat pie and whip cream for breakfast.<br/>\nIt is like I know the pie is temporary and I better get it while I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nFifth, the kid is not vegging out.  It only looks like it from the outside.<br/>\nThe amount of decision making and concentration necessary to play those<br/>\ngames is tremendous.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake heart.  My kids originally binged on television.  I have 5 kids, its<br/>\nraining outside, Dad and Mom are otherwise occupied, there are 2 newly<br/>\nrented movies on the counter and all the kids are playing in the garage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis too shall pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50953,"nextTopicId":51020}}
