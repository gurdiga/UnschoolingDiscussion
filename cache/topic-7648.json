(DH was injured in an accident) With DH \nhome, we have had more time to travel and not worry about time constraints. It \nalso serves as a buffer when I need down time. I know that DH has loved the time \nhe has spent with the children, and none of us looks forward to the day that he \nreturns to the office. :( It is so great to have him here, and he has learned \nthings about the children that I do not think he would if he were going to the \noffice at 6:30am.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"4\">Stephanie<br><br><br></font></div>\n<div><font color=\"#008080\" face=\"Lucida Handwriting\" size=\"4\">Ron and Stephanie \n<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Get Paid to Surf the Web.&nbsp; It&#39;s \nfree, easy and fun.<br>Sign up for AllAdvantage.com at<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid=KYI-740\">http://alladvantage.com/go.asp?refid=KYI-740</a><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Online \npaying without digging out your credit cards?<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://secure.paypal.com/refer/pal=ronandstphanie%40prodigy.net\">https://secure.paypal.com/refer/pal=ronandstphanie%40prodigy.net</a></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7595,"nextTopicId":7530}}
