I hadn&#39;t thought about it but in fairy<br/>\n&gt; tales the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; magic folk are always in a supportive role to the humans who<br/>\n&gt; are the central<br/>\n&gt; &gt; figures. Likewise Christians are encouraged to rely on the<br/>\n&gt; power of God but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not wield the powers for themselves. But in HP the wizards and<br/>\n&gt; witches are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; enhanced by magic and consider themselves better than<br/>\n&gt; humans/Christians (who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; obviously won&#39;t use magic.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting twist. I wonder why the power wielded by<br/>\n&gt; Gandalf is considered okay to use. LOTR seems to me more<br/>\n&gt; like Star Wars: that there is power out there and it depends on<br/>\n&gt; who is using it whether it&#39;s for good or evil. Frodo (not a human<br/>\n&gt; but a hobbit) wouldn&#39;t use the corrupting power for his own gain,<br/>\n&gt; but he relied heavily on Gandalf&#39;s magical abilities to protect and<br/>\n&gt; direct him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Somehow this still feels like a not true parallel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, in HP, the interesting thing about the magic is that it has to<br/>\n&gt; be learned. The nature of the magic is impacted by the character<br/>\n&gt; of the user. To me, this was a picture of spiritual life. All of us<br/>\n&gt; have the same stuff available for liviing, but we make choices<br/>\n&gt; about how we&#39;ll live. Magic wasn&#39;t limited to only one good or bad<br/>\n&gt; side, but was available to all who were from that realm.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d heard bits and pieces of Christ&#39;s time in the desert and the<br/>\n&gt; temptation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He describes it here as Christ turning down the chance to use<br/>\n&gt; magic to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; convert people. (I can&#39;t quite get that out of the passage or<br/>\n&gt; maybe I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reading the right one, but anyway Christ does turn down the<br/>\n&gt; chance to feed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; himself with magic.) Frodo recognizes the corrupting power of<br/>\n&gt; magic and is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on a quest to get rid of it. Harry obviously embraces magic to<br/>\n&gt; do good,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something that apparently Christ recognized he shouldn&#39;t do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yes, but Christ does the &quot;deep magic&quot; (as Lewis would say) and<br/>\n&gt; rises from the dead. He uses his powers for good by healing<br/>\n&gt; people.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The difference here is that in HP, Harry chooses over and over<br/>\n&gt; again to offer himself, not to just use magic. He is using his<br/>\n&gt; powers for ultimate, righteous good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In that way, I&#39;d say that Christ is similar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for the food for thought.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie B<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2003 15:03:31 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Heidi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Conservative homeschoolers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It wasn&#39;t that pogs were evil...it was the waste of time and money<br/>\n&gt; that was evil, you see. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for the fairy tale thing...I remember when Dobson (a BIG leader in<br/>\n&gt; evangelicaldom today) came out with some diatribe against<br/>\n&gt; Disney, &quot;where are the moms?&quot; and cited many of Disney&#39;s cartoons,<br/>\n&gt; where the mother is absent from the story. tsk. tsk.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HELLO? Western fairy tales are ABOUT the Bad Things That Happen when<br/>\n&gt; Mom Isn&#39;t in the Picture. Duh. Snow White, in the original story,<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have a Mom. Cinderella&#39;s Mom was missing, too. Name a<br/>\n&gt; traditional fairy tale, and most likely, Mom will be gone, to be<br/>\n&gt; replaced by a Wicked Stepmother or No Mother At All. When Disney<br/>\n&gt; portrayed a fairy tale on screen, he was just taking the stories that<br/>\n&gt; enculturated generation upon generation of European Children, and<br/>\n&gt; telling them to us in his style.  He didn&#39;t eliminate the mothers;<br/>\n&gt; the stories had no mothers to BEGIN with! ugh.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But there has also been a drive, in the past, to take out the &quot;bad<br/>\n&gt; stuff&quot; in the stories. In Red Riding Hood, the original story had the<br/>\n&gt; Grandma DEAD after the wolf was killed. There are some gruesome<br/>\n&gt; details in the stories people have told their children over the ages,<br/>\n&gt; but some &quot;expert&quot; (a certified educator, no doubt) got it in his or<br/>\n&gt; her head, that these images were too much for little kids, and many<br/>\n&gt; stories now eliminate the icky stuff.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FAIRY TALES, FOLKS! As in, tales from the Land of Faery? As in Make<br/>\n&gt; Believe?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *stepping down from soap box*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Heidi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s.

There are even books<br/>\n&gt; &gt; written about it, like Harry Potter and the Bible.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the connection to the church as an institution, is that<br/>\n&gt; once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Christians traded their community based-lifestyles for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Constantine&#39;s &quot;Christian temples&quot;, modeled after the pagan ones<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (complete with pagan-style choirs and three point messages), they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; also gave up thinking for themselves to a large degree.  There is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this huge clergy-laity distinction, and all it takes is for a<br/>\n&gt; couple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of &quot;pastors&quot; to preach from the pulpit and write a few books about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how evil something is, and most of the Christian world believes it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; automatically.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sheila, who loves Jesus but hates religion and loves learning but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hates schools.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2003 15:06:15 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Heidi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&gt;&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bunsofaluminum60@...\">bunsofaluminum60@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: kids and candy, help please<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, yummy, yes!

There are churches where the sermon is designed to make you think,<br/>\n&gt; to challenge you to see God in a different way.  There are churches that<br/>\n&gt; worship in three completely different ways on Sundays, but still are held<br/>\n&gt; together by a common foundation of faith.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t agree with everyone who worships at my church.  I have been a part<br/>\n&gt; of 9 churches in my 10 years of marriage (military...we move a lot!).<br/>\nWhile<br/>\n&gt; my beliefs aren&#39;t a perfect match for perhaps any church, I&#39;ve had clergy<br/>\n&gt; who encourage me to read, study, think, pray, and consider why I believe<br/>\n&gt; what I do believe, so I can grow personally.  Much like I do as an<br/>\n&gt; unschooler.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s what you miss when you don&#39;t go to church: community.  I regularly<br/>\n&gt; hear from people on this list that they&#39;re so glad to find this group,<br/>\n&gt; because they don&#39;t know any other unschoolers.  So I know that community<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; important to us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Community isn&#39;t necessary, plenty of folks believe and are comfortable<br/>\nbeing<br/>\n&gt; alone in their faith.  But community does provide you with much support.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t give up on churches entirely because you haven&#39;t found one that<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t ask you to check your brain at the door.  They&#39;re out there.<br/>\n&gt; Really.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; brenda<br/>\n&gt; Episcopalian and proud of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1/21/03 04:37:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I never liked the group<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thinking mentality of church, or any other corporate entity for that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; matter. I get so tired of hearing &quot;we believe&quot; and &quot;we think&quot; that I<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to scream &quot;NO! WHAT DO *YOU* BELIEVE! WHAT DO *YOU* THINK!&quot; Anytime<br/>\n&gt; &gt; an entire group of people *think* the same thing, there is no thinking<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all, imo. I have come to the belief that a vast majority of people like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be indoctrinated. It releases them of all responsibility and reason.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If everyone at a church believed God could only be worshipped in one<br/>\nway,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would doubt the motives of the church.  If everyone on a list thought<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that there was only one way of unschooling, I would seriously have<br/>\ndoubts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the integrity of the list. Even though we sometimes disagree, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; value the free-thinking-ness of this list. Unfortunately, I have yet to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; find a church<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that offers the same.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 7<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2003 17:34:48 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;rebecca &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elfmama92104@...\">elfmama92104@...</a>&gt;&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elfmama92104@...\">elfmama92104@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: kids and candy. update<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good morning, I met to post yesterday but Avery got really sick and<br/>\n&gt; getting on the computer was not an option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, so for the past 2 days food in are house has been done a little<br/>\n&gt; different, I loved the idea of the monkey platters and we made up a<br/>\n&gt; couple, with different goodies on both, Jaiden and Avery loved them,<br/>\n&gt; and I have been asked if we can have them every day, they eat stuff I<br/>\n&gt; had no idea that they would eat. It was very cool. So on sunday I<br/>\n&gt; decided that no matter what my kids ate or drank I wasn&#39;t going to<br/>\n&gt; expect that &quot;hyper behavior&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to put all the negitive<br/>\n&gt; junk my parents had put on to to me, back on to them. And damn if<br/>\n&gt; there was no difference in their behavoir, until a friend of ours and<br/>\n&gt; his 3 girls showed up to play, total excitement, we hadn&#39;t seen them<br/>\n&gt; since before x-mas so they were all very excited, so it was not the<br/>\n&gt; candy, it was the situation, major shift in thinking for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do have to say that both of them have been making amazing food<br/>\n&gt; choices the last few days, I never would have thought that Avery<br/>\n&gt; would not eat the candy in favor of the cheeese, although Jaiden<br/>\n&gt; showed him how to wrap m&ms up in cheese, &lt;shudder&gt; but they both<br/>\n&gt; seem to like it, and thats what matters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, thank you all so much for your sharing your thoughts and time<br/>\n&gt; with me.

I<br/>\n&gt; would say our parenting hasn&#39;t changed much lately, except for possibly<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; words I use with the children. My husband Joe is still a bit more strict<br/>\n&gt; than I would like but he&#39;s trying and listens to all my suggestions on<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; to do and not to do with the kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now for the question. Is there a general age when you have noticed that<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; children become more aware of others and start to not be so selfish?<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;m thinking of it more or the kids are more into<br/>\n&gt; themselves lately, but they seem so into themselves recently they don&#39;t<br/>\nstop<br/>\n&gt; to think about others. I hear their words when there is a conflict, that<br/>\n&gt; they talk it out and think of how the other would feel. What I don&#39;t see<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; the action behind it on a daily basis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just as an example, this morning my 2 middle kids got up very early, (for<br/>\n&gt; this house) it was obvious everyone else was asleep. They proceded to play<br/>\n&gt; in the playroom at a noise level that would wake the dead. I mentioned it<br/>\n&gt; once and not 3 minutes later, it was just as loud as before. That&#39;s the<br/>\nkind<br/>\n&gt; of stuff I am thinking that maybe they would see by now. I&#39;m not looking<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; a magical age, I know they are kids, but I just kind of worry now that<br/>\nmaybe<br/>\n&gt; they won&#39;t get it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mary B<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; The new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2003 14:47:11 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: kids and candy. update<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/21/2003 12:36:07 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elfmama92104@...\">elfmama92104@...</a> writes:&gt; So, thank you all so much for your sharing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; your thoughts and time<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with me.
