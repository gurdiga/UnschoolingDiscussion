I was a girl raised under this sort of moral law. I did<br/>\nmove out at age 17 just as soon as I could, because of my Dad being so very<br/>\nstrict. I hardly spoke to my Dad for years afterward.. I never want it to be<br/>\nthat way with me and my daughters.  I have three daughters..my oldest is 19<br/>\nand recently moved out to live with her boyfriend..also a 13 and an 8 yr<br/>\nold. My oldest chose to become sexually active at 17. I wish she would have<br/>\nwaited..but she was aware of the risks..both physical and emotional. She<br/>\ndidn&#39;t chose to have sex because she was being &#39;rebellious&#39;. Right now she<br/>\nsays she never wants to be married. We&#39;ve only been unschoolers for the past<br/>\n5 years..more &#39;school-at-home&#39; types 6 yrs before that.. so maybe things<br/>\nwould have been different for my eldest if we had dropped all the baggage<br/>\nsooner.
