I became a genuis.. LOL., nah, just kidding.. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut &quot;something&quot; did happen to me at that age.  It was like an acute awareness <br/>\nof &quot;stuff&quot;,  of life, emotions, actions and reactions.. I attributed my <br/>\n&quot;awakening&quot; to the fact that my children were all finally out of the high <br/>\nmaintenance stage after more than 10 years of intense &quot;need&quot; for their Moma.  <br/>\n  JP was about 4, potty trained, .. And the older kids were old enough to <br/>\nhelp watch out for each other.    I thought it was a matter of getting <br/>\nmarried young, knowing no other life but wife and mother for over 13 years.. <br/>\nThen BAM!  I realized, there was a &#39;me&quot; in there, seperate from &quot;them&quot;.. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, maybe it was all that.. or maybe it was the brain-spurt.   At any rate, <br/>\nI really went through a tough time for a couple of years.  But, now, I just <br/>\nenjoy my new &quot;philosophical&quot; outlook on life. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66037,"nextTopicId":65972}}
