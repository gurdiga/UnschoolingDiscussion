While hydrogen can be extracted from water using solar or <br/>\nwind-powered electricity, current plans for the hydrogen <br/>\ninfrastructure call for most of the hydrogen to be produced from oil, <br/>\nnatural gas, and other non-renewable resources.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;According to the administration&#39;s National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap, <br/>\ndrafted last year in concert with the energy industry, up to 90 <br/>\npercent of all hydrogen will be refined from oil, natural gas, and <br/>\nother fossil fuels -- in a process using energy generated by burning <br/>\noil, coal, and natural gas. The remaining 10 percent will be cracked <br/>\nfrom water using nuclear energy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis quote is from the article &quot;Hydrogen&#39;s Dirty Secret&quot; at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2003/05/ma_375_01.html\">http://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2003/05/ma_375_01.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly hope that hydrogen will become a totally clean and <br/>\nrenewable fuel supply at some point, but in the immediate future, <br/>\nit&#39;s not looking like that is going to be the case. I&#39;m going to <br/>\nstick with biodiesel for now, something that can be made from almost <br/>\nanything grown in the ground that makes oil (some folks have talked <br/>\nabout making it from kudzu, now wouldn&#39;t that be a bonus!!) <br/>\nAdditionally, biodiesel can be pumped from existing fuel station <br/>\ninfrastructure, instead of the expensive hydrogen stations that will <br/>\nneed to be built. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, from an unschooling perspective, biodiesel is way cool because <br/>\nyou can make it yourself. I&#39;m a big fan of anything that we, as a <br/>\nfamily, can do for ourselves, rather than relying on a big <br/>\nbeauracracy to accomplish for us. Families running on biodiesel might <br/>\nnever even have to go to a gas station. I&#39;m fairly sure this is why <br/>\nhydrogen is getting a lot of press and talk time from the government, <br/>\nbecause it can be controlled by big business. No one in the corporate <br/>\nworld wants to think about a fuel that people could make themselves - <br/>\nwhere&#39;s the profit in that? Kind of like unschooling, in a way. If <br/>\nthe emperor isn&#39;t wearing any clothes (if we don&#39;t need schools, or <br/>\nfuel pumps), those who stand to make money from the emperor&#39;s parade <br/>\nstart getting scared. To me, hydrogen cells aren&#39;t all that different <br/>\nfrom charter &quot;home&quot;schools, just the same beauracracy trying to sell <br/>\nus something different that we don&#39;t really need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7527178,"authorName":"CelticFrau@aol.com","from":"CelticFrau@...","profile":"celticfrau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Biodiesel","postDate":"1086026468","msgId":94923,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZS40MmY4ODZkNC4yZGVjY2NlNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94920,"nextInTopic":94924,"prevInTime":94922,"nextInTime":94924,"topicId":94920,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/31/2004 10:29:23 AM Eastern Standard Time, ... saying there won t be an energy crisis), please research fuel cells and hydrogen","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-566468124\">In a message dated 5/31/2004 10:29:23 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;So for those of you that are actually worried about this issue (and I&#39;m not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>saying there won&#39;t be an energy crisis), please research fuel cells and <br/>\nhydrogen technology&lt;&lt;<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\nI saw in the Timberdoodle catalog a fuel cell car kit.
