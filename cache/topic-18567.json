Every Montessori","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-38396573\">The only thing I know for sure about Montessori, is that she was a woman<br/>\nwho helped (learning-disabled?) children make wonderful progress.  Every<br/>\n&quot;Montessori&quot; school will be different, based on what they think is<br/>\nimportant about M&#39;s work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a neighbor whose son attended a &quot;good&quot; local M preschool.  She<br/>\nthought it was good that the school made sure that the kids knew when<br/>\nsomething that were being told was fantasy.  Her 5 year old had a huge<br/>\nargument one day with mine, because mine was playing a magic game and<br/>\nsaid magic was real.  He was insistent that magic isn&#39;t real and was<br/>\nreally getting mad about it.  He is a very analytical boy anyway, and<br/>\nmaybe it had nothing to do with the school&#39;s policy on &quot;realness&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took my oldest dd to a cooperative preschool.  What I liked was that<br/>\nthe kids were allowed to choose their own activities for all but the<br/>\nfirst few minutes, last few minutes, and snack time.  (Now I would even<br/>\nsee that part different - why should a kid HAVE to participate in snack<br/>\ntime?  Oh, I just remembered why.  Because before snack time, everyone<br/>\nhelped pick up so we didn&#39;t want anyone getting toys back out then. <br/>\nAnyway...)  But in between the child could do ALL art or NO art or any<br/>\nother variation of the activities that there were to choose from.  Also,<br/>\nall the parents were allowed to stay and the parents took turns as<br/>\nclassroom aids, so there was a high adult/child ratio.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I had a second child, getting one to preschool seemed like too much<br/>\neffort for me!  Then I started learning about homeschooling, then<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGive plenty of time to your children.<br/>\nBe patient with your spouse, coworkers, and friends.<br/>\nEverywhere, take your time.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18564,"nextTopicId":18582}}
