Apatosaurus, <br/>\nbrachiosaurus, coelophysis....these names are tossed around our house in the <br/>\ncourse of normal conversation. I&#39;m not sure if he was first introduced to <br/>\ndinosaurs through TV or books or even Land Before Time videos but they are <br/>\ndefinitely now a part of our day-to-day life and I have learned far more <br/>\nabout dinosaurs than I ever wanted to know! This interest has also shown me <br/>\nhow to trust that learning occurs when a child is allowed to explore his or <br/>\nher passions without a parent disrupting the natural flow with explanations <br/>\nor &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n      Here are some examples of natural learning that have taken place during <br/>\nthe dinosaur phase:<br/>\n      <br/>\n      As Trevor approached the age of 5, I was beginning to be slightly <br/>\nconcerned with my son&#39;s &quot;odd&quot; pencil grip and his utter lack of desire to <br/>\nwrite his letters. In my mind, I knew that he was still very young but I <br/>\ncould not help trying to correct his pencil grip or demonstrating how to <br/>\nwrite &quot;cat.&quot; My efforts were met with his justified refusal to write anything <br/>\nat all and I decided to let him move at his own pace (which is what I should <br/>\nhave done in the first place.) <br/>\n<br/>\n     Months went by and he developed the interest in dinosaurs. He spent many <br/>\nhours pouring over picture books and being an early reader, read them aloud <br/>\nto anyone who would listen. After a while, we would find him lying on the <br/>\nfloor drawing pictures of the various species of dinosaurs. When he showed <br/>\nthem to us, he would proudly point out each type, &quot;This is a Tyrannosaurus <br/>\nrex, this is a stegosaurus, this is an archaeopteryx&quot; and so on. One day, he <br/>\nbrought me a picture he had drawn of a big, long-necked dinosaur and under <br/>\nthe drawing was the scrawled word &quot;brachiosaurus.&quot; His passion for dinosaurs <br/>\nhad prompted him to write that long word better than all my efforts to get <br/>\nhim to write &quot;cat!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n       Trevor has also learned a lot about science, of course, through this <br/>\ndinosaur phase. He&#39;s learned what an omnivore, an herbivore and a carnivore <br/>\nare and about predators, scavengers and prey. These concepts led to <br/>\ndiscussions about food chains and life in the wild.<br/>\n<br/>\n       We&#39;ve also talked about the different theories of the dinosaurs&#39; <br/>\nextinction and the evidence which make scientists support the different <br/>\ntheories. We went to Fossil Park in Sylvania, Ohio and learned about fossils <br/>\nand then we read about the tar pits where dinosaurs would meet untimely <br/>\ndeaths. This led to discussions about the geographical locations of various <br/>\ndinosaurs and we located them on a world map. <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n       The questions about dinosaurs soon exceeded my meager knowledge of <br/>\nthem and Trevor learned ways to find his own answers. I showed him how to <br/>\nsearch for information online, how to look up specific names in glossaries <br/>\nand indexes of books and how to check his own books out of the library. These <br/>\nskills will aid him in learning about any subject in which he will be <br/>\ninterested in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Just yesterday, he glanced up from one of his books and exclaimed, <br/>\n&quot;Hey, Mom, this says that dimetrodons were 29 feet long! How long is that?&quot; <br/>\nWe got out a 12-inch ruler and marked off 29 feet across the house. &quot;Wow, <br/>\nthat&#39;s really long!&quot; he said with his eyes wide. I think that was the first <br/>\ntime he really realized how big some of those creatures were. He spent the <br/>\nrest of the afternoon mapping about the lengths of various other dinosaurs <br/>\nand then measured the lengths of items around the house, like books, crayons <br/>\nand his little sister&#39;s ponytail!<br/>\n<br/>\n        Watching my son follow his interests and learning about his world in <br/>\nthe process has been an enlightening experience for me. I have a new <br/>\nconfidence in children&#39;s curiosity and their drive to learn and explore. As I <br/>\nwrite, Trevor is developing a a new interest in sharks and I can only <br/>\nanticipate what paths we will follow and what we will learn.
