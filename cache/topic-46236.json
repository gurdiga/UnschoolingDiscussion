They boys had an absolute blast and I enjoyed some &quot;adult&quot; time for a change LOL! The boys weaved a gigantic floor to ceiling to wall spider web, painted with shaving cream, made an orb out of newspapers, made faces out of gourds and fruit, played with balloons full of marshmallows and noodles and paddles made from coathangers and panty hose, learned a few magic tricks, listened to some Native American stories and looked at things like animal skins, turtle purses, and woven baskets, dressed up like animals and clowns, made static electricity, tried to juggle, and played with blocks and wooden trains and various games. Hmmm I think that&#39;s it, but it feels like I&#39;m leaving something out! DH and I did a little of all of the above with them, plus listened to speakers talking about unschooling &quot;out of sync&quot; children, had about a half-hour discussion about laws and legislatures and what to do about both, met several people I&#39;ve talked to online via e-mail, and listened to two sets of parents who have grown-up children who they unschooled. We didn&#39;t make it to the talent show tonight, by 6:00 Brett was getting over-wound and was not calming down, and Tyler was yawning and getting whiny so we came back home. Whew! I&#39;m off to bed early tonight! <br/>\n<br/>\nMyranda 8-)<br/>\nWAH,HS,M<br/>\nMarried to Daniel since 12/31/94<br/>\nBrett 9/4/95<br/>\nTyler 1/22/97<br/>\nCassidy 1/19/02<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46076,"nextTopicId":46156}}
