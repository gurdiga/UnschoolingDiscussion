He doesn&#39;t like to brush his teeth because he<br/>\nhas developed a &quot;thing&quot; about toothpaste.  The backs of his ears could grow<br/>\npotatoes.  His room is a disaster.  His choices in these areas do not<br/>\nreflect my priorities.  Normally, that is fine.  But at some point, his<br/>\nchoices bump up against others in the family and we have to come up with a<br/>\nplan.  When I am out money because Zach needs extra dental care, we have a<br/>\ntalk about his teeth and eventually decided that I would remind him every<br/>\nmorning to brush.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work very hard to look at my reasoning behind my intervention.  Is it<br/>\nbecause his actions are not what I would choose or are they actually<br/>\ninterfering with other people?  That is the basis I use to determine if I<br/>\nwill step in......so his room is still a disaster and his ears are filthy  .<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29529,"nextTopicId":29516}}
