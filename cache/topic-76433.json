Larry Peirson, the man accused of the molestation, was in charge of Homelink, my first homeschooling experience.<br/>\nIt was a homeschoolers &quot;school&quot; where one could sign up for 1-4 classes a week at no charge to the family (publicly funded). We took music, computer and science classes there the first two years we homeschooled. It was a great way to start for me, because we had fun and I was around loads of other homeschoolers (gave me some confidence in that early, jump-off-the-cliff stage).<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing is, this man that was in charge of the school, was a very prominent Christian. Almost everyone at the school was Christian families...I wonder how they&#39;re feeling about their beloved leader now?<br/>\nUgh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76428,"nextTopicId":76226}}
