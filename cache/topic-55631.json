I have lots of<br/>\nfabric and stuff if she wants to learn to sew. If she wants to learn to<br/>\nsew, a good project to start out with is pillows shaped liked the letters<br/>\nin her name. Easy to make the patterns, you can use scraps of fabric so<br/>\nit is cheap. The only thing that can get expensive is the fiberfill if<br/>\nshe has a long name. Maybe it&#39;s time to retire one of your bed pillows???<br/>\nThey can have a lot of fun with this, and like having all the pillows on<br/>\ntheir beds. Let me know where you are, and we can see if we can get<br/>\ntogether if she is interested.

First, by <br/>\n&gt; sketch pad.<br/>\n&gt;   If your daughter wants to get an idea of how fashion design art <br/>\n&gt; looks,<br/>\n&gt;   try to get your hands on a copy of *WWD* (Womens&#39; Wear Daily). It <br/>\n&gt; is the<br/>\n&gt;   fashion industry bible and is loaded with pictures, as well as <br/>\n&gt; other info<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ll get into later. If she wants to get the hang of drawing the <br/>\n&gt; human<br/>\n&gt;   form, and clothing, photo copy a picture of the body form, and let <br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt;   draw various clothes on them. (If you need a copy, I can fax you <br/>\n&gt; one)<br/>\n&gt;   Once she gets good at the proportions, she can draw the whole <br/>\n&gt; look<br/>\n&gt;   freehand. The second way that most designers transfer their idea <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   concept is by what it called draping. For this, it is most easily <br/>\n&gt; done<br/>\n&gt;   using a dress form. You can sometimes find them in local sale <br/>\n&gt; papers,<br/>\n&gt;   maybe on the internet. What you do is cut, pin, and drape muslin <br/>\n&gt; on the<br/>\n&gt;   dress form till you get the look you want. <br/>\n&gt;   Once you have the design you want, you need to choose colors and <br/>\n&gt; fabrics.<br/>\n&gt;   To choose the proper fabrics, maybe your daughter would want to <br/>\n&gt; start her<br/>\n&gt;   own textile catalog. What I did was go to a fabric store and get a <br/>\n&gt; bunch<br/>\n&gt;   of different swatches of fabric (about 1&quot; square pieces) and <br/>\n&gt; staple them<br/>\n&gt;   each to a 3X5 card. On the card you can write information such as <br/>\n&gt; fiber<br/>\n&gt;   content, and fabric care. Show her how to tell the difference <br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt;   natural and synthetic fibers, and the pros and cons of each. Show <br/>\n&gt; her how<br/>\n&gt;   to determine the different textures, and show her the difference <br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt;   woven, knit, and felted material. Have her identify this info <br/>\n&gt; about each<br/>\n&gt;   swatch on the 3x5 card. All this info is vital in choosing the <br/>\n&gt; proper<br/>\n&gt;   fabric for her designs. Once you pick the fabric, this will limit <br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt;   color choices as to what is available (unless you get into dying <br/>\n&gt; your own<br/>\n&gt;   fabric, which I have not).<br/>\n&gt;           To make your designs into clothes, you need to make <br/>\n&gt; patterns. If<br/>\n&gt;   you start out with a basic straight skirt, bodice front, and <br/>\n&gt; bodice back,<br/>\n&gt;   you can pretty much change them to whatever design you need. If <br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt;   daughter is not familiar with sewing terminology, she will need to <br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt;   some basics. Show her what darts, pleats, gathers, seam allowance, <br/>\n&gt; etc<br/>\n&gt;   is, and give her scraps of fabric to practice these skills with. <br/>\n&gt; To make<br/>\n&gt;   patterns, I use rolls of white newsprint paper that you can get <br/>\n&gt; free from<br/>\n&gt;   your news printer. When they get close to the end of the roll, <br/>\n&gt; they just<br/>\n&gt;   get rid of them. There is usually 80 feet or better left on them, <br/>\n&gt; plenty<br/>\n&gt;   to make patterns. Making patterns is more easily shown than <br/>\n&gt; described, so<br/>\n&gt;   hopefully you have enough basic sewing knowledge to get her <br/>\n&gt; through this<br/>\n&gt;   part &lt;grin&gt;. If my end design is going to be made of expensive <br/>\n&gt; fabric, I<br/>\n&gt;   first make the garment out of muslin, then make any changes <br/>\n&gt; necessary on<br/>\n&gt;   the pattern. I learned this the hard and expensive way.<br/>\n&gt;           If your daughter wants to learn more about marketing the<br/>\n&gt;   fashions, *WWD* lists fashion show schedules. It also shows the <br/>\n&gt; trends<br/>\n&gt;   and styles that will be prevalent the following year. You may want <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;   take her to a fashion show in New York, and let her see one in <br/>\n&gt; action.<br/>\n&gt;   You could also just take her to the garment district, I think <br/>\n&gt; around 5th<br/>\n&gt;   Avenue. They used to give tours, but I don&#39;t know if they still do <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt;   or not. Maybe your daughter would want to put on her own fashion <br/>\n&gt; show.<br/>\n&gt;   She could get together with a bunch of friends and swap clothes <br/>\n&gt; and do an<br/>\n&gt;   impromptu show. Or, depending where you live, there are some <br/>\n&gt; clothing<br/>\n&gt;   stores that put on fashion shows to expose new clothing lines.<br/>\n&gt;   I was a manager at a Fashion Bug umpteen years ago, when they <br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt;   started carrying childrens&#39; clothing. I recruited children, and we <br/>\n&gt; put on<br/>\n&gt;   a little show in their school auditorium. Then they got a discount <br/>\n&gt; on the<br/>\n&gt;   clothes they wore. Ask around at different stores to see if they <br/>\n&gt; put on<br/>\n&gt;   fashion shows, and ask how your daughter can help. Anything from<br/>\n&gt;   modeling, to steaming the clothes, to accessorizing outfits. <br/>\n&gt; Another<br/>\n&gt;   thing she can do is ask stores when their display day is, when <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt;   change all the mannequins and store displays. If you left your <br/>\n&gt; phone<br/>\n&gt;   number with them, and asked them to call you when they were going <br/>\n&gt; to do<br/>\n&gt;   them, it would be great for your daughter to watch. It&#39;s just <br/>\n&gt; like<br/>\n&gt;   dressing big dolls. If you run into a nice store manager, they may <br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt;   let her help, and often times are even looking for a younger <br/>\n&gt; girls<br/>\n&gt;   perspective. <br/>\n&gt;           As far as the buying end of fashion, it might be helpful <br/>\n&gt; to know<br/>\n&gt;   where you are, and what chain headquarters are near you. Charming<br/>\n&gt;   Shoppes, which owns the chain of Fashion Bug stores, is in <br/>\n&gt; Bensalem, PA.<br/>\n&gt;   If you called them, they might let your daughter actually see <br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt;   buying department in action (good PR for them). Depending on what <br/>\n&gt; line<br/>\n&gt;   the buyer is buying for, they may purchase directly from the <br/>\n&gt; designer,<br/>\n&gt;   from a distributor, or from catalogs. Hosiery, lingerie, and <br/>\n&gt; accessories<br/>\n&gt;   are generally purchased out of catalogs. Most larger chains, like <br/>\n&gt; Fashion<br/>\n&gt;   Bug, have in-house designers that design for their store labels, <br/>\n&gt; and then<br/>\n&gt;   have the garments made overseas and shipped back. Hess&#39; Department <br/>\n&gt; store<br/>\n&gt;   used to be in Allentown, PA and they at one time where the top <br/>\n&gt; upscale<br/>\n&gt;   store in the nation. It was exciting watching the buyers choose <br/>\n&gt; lavish<br/>\n&gt;   sequined gowns at fashion shows, and ordering these $2000 and up <br/>\n&gt; dresses,<br/>\n&gt;   ten at a time. At 19 years old it was really a LOT of money. Very<br/>\n&gt;   fascinating. Maybe there is an upscale store in your area that you <br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt;   talk to.<br/>\n&gt;           Also, if there is an art college near you, they probably <br/>\n&gt; have a<br/>\n&gt;   fashion design program. They may let you and your daughter sit in <br/>\n&gt; on a<br/>\n&gt;   class, or join them on field trips. They are also usually in need <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt;   younger people for fitting and modeling purposes. Call the <br/>\n&gt; department<br/>\n&gt;   head and see how flexible they are. Find out when they put their <br/>\n&gt; shows<br/>\n&gt;   on, and just go to watch.<br/>\n&gt;           I&#39;m sure that I left some stuff out. Hope this helps, and <br/>\n&gt; let me<br/>\n&gt;   know if you want more info.<br/>\n&gt;   Wende<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   On Sun, 19 Jan 2003 00:21:15 -0500 Have a Nice Day!<br/>\n&gt;   &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; My 10 year old daughter is very interested in designing <br/>\n&gt; clothing. <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Anyone know where I can get more info on this, or software, or <br/>\n&gt; ideas <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; for her? <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; I also wanted to look into the &quot;buyer&quot; aspect of it.  <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Does anyone have any info on this?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; kristen<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt; ****************************************************************<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make <br/>\n&gt; things <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; better than yesterday.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as <br/>\n&gt; we <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; can manage.<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Maybe your daughter would want to put on her own fashion show.<br/>\n  She could get together with a bunch of friends and swap clothes and do an<br/>\n  impromptu show. Or, depending where you live, there are some clothing<br/>\n  stores that put on fashion shows to expose new clothing lines.<br/>\n  I was a manager at a Fashion Bug umpteen years ago, when they just<br/>\n  started carrying childrens&#39; clothing. I recruited children, and we put on<br/>\n  a little show in their school auditorium. Then they got a discount on the<br/>\n  clothes they wore. Ask around at different stores to see if they put on<br/>\n  fashion shows, and ask how your daughter can help. Anything from<br/>\n  modeling, to steaming the clothes, to accessorizing outfits. Another<br/>\n  thing she can do is ask stores when their display day is, when they<br/>\n  change all the mannequins and store displays. If you left your phone<br/>\n  number with them, and asked them to call you when they were going to do<br/>\n  them, it would be great for your daughter to watch. It&#39;s just like<br/>\n  dressing big dolls. If you run into a nice store manager, they may even<br/>\n  let her help, and often times are even looking for a younger girls<br/>\n  perspective. <br/>\n          As far as the buying end of fashion, it might be helpful to know<br/>\n  where you are, and what chain headquarters are near you. Charming<br/>\n  Shoppes, which owns the chain of Fashion Bug stores, is in Bensalem, PA.<br/>\n  If you called them, they might let your daughter actually see their<br/>\n  buying department in action (good PR for them). Depending on what line<br/>\n  the buyer is buying for, they may purchase directly from the designer,<br/>\n  from a distributor, or from catalogs. Hosiery, lingerie, and accessories<br/>\n  are generally purchased out of catalogs. Most larger chains, like Fashion<br/>\n  Bug, have in-house designers that design for their store labels, and then<br/>\n  have the garments made overseas and shipped back. Hess&#39; Department store<br/>\n  used to be in Allentown, PA and they at one time where the top upscale<br/>\n  store in the nation. It was exciting watching the buyers choose lavish<br/>\n  sequined gowns at fashion shows, and ordering these $2000 and up dresses,<br/>\n  ten at a time. At 19 years old it was really a LOT of money. Very<br/>\n  fascinating. Maybe there is an upscale store in your area that you can<br/>\n  talk to.<br/>\n          Also, if there is an art college near you, they probably have a<br/>\n  fashion design program. They may let you and your daughter sit in on a<br/>\n  class, or join them on field trips. They are also usually in need of<br/>\n  younger people for fitting and modeling purposes. Call the department<br/>\n  head and see how flexible they are. Find out when they put their shows<br/>\n  on, and just go to watch.<br/>\n          I&#39;m sure that I left some stuff out. Hope this helps, and let me<br/>\n  know if you want more info.<br/>\n  Wende<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Sun, 19 Jan 2003 00:21:15 -0500 Have a Nice Day!<br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n  &gt; My 10 year old daughter is very interested in designing clothing. <br/>\n  &gt; Anyone know where I can get more info on this, or software, or ideas <br/>\n  &gt; for her? <br/>\n  &gt; I also wanted to look into the &quot;buyer&quot; aspect of it.  <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Does anyone have any info on this?<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Thanks!<br/>\n  &gt; kristen<br/>\n  &gt; ****************************************************************<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a <br/>\n  &gt; gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things <br/>\n  &gt; better than yesterday.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth <br/>\n  &gt; living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we <br/>\n  &gt; can manage.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-856756147\">Kristen,<br/>\nThere are so many different aspects of the fashion industry, so I&#39;ll<br/>\ntouch on some generals, and if you want more info on specifics let me<br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nFashion design starts out as the idea in the designers head, and is<br/>\nusually transformed to concept in one of two ways. First, by sketch pad.<br/>\nIf your daughter wants to get an idea of how fashion design art looks,<br/>\ntry to get your hands on a copy of *WWD* (Womens&#39; Wear Daily). It is the<br/>\nfashion industry bible and is loaded with pictures, as well as other info<br/>\nI&#39;ll get into later. If she wants to get the hang of drawing the human<br/>\nform, and clothing, photo copy a picture of the body form, and let her<br/>\ndraw various clothes on them. (If you need a copy, I can fax you one)<br/>\nOnce she gets good at the proportions, she can draw the whole look<br/>\nfreehand. The second way that most designers transfer their idea to<br/>\nconcept is by what it called draping. For this, it is most easily done<br/>\nusing a dress form. You can sometimes find them in local sale papers,<br/>\nmaybe on the internet. What you do is cut, pin, and drape muslin on the<br/>\ndress form till you get the look you want. <br/>\nOnce you have the design you want, you need to choose colors and fabrics.<br/>\nTo choose the proper fabrics, maybe your daughter would want to start her<br/>\nown textile catalog. What I did was go to a fabric store and get a bunch<br/>\nof different swatches of fabric (about 1&quot; square pieces) and staple them<br/>\neach to a 3X5 card. On the card you can write information such as fiber<br/>\ncontent, and fabric care. Show her how to tell the difference between<br/>\nnatural and synthetic fibers, and the pros and cons of each. Show her how<br/>\nto determine the different textures, and show her the difference between<br/>\nwoven, knit, and felted material. Have her identify this info about each<br/>\nswatch on the 3x5 card. All this info is vital in choosing the proper<br/>\nfabric for her designs. Once you pick the fabric, this will limit your<br/>\ncolor choices as to what is available (unless you get into dying your own<br/>\nfabric, which I have not).<br/>\n        To make your designs into clothes, you need to make patterns. If<br/>\nyou start out with a basic straight skirt, bodice front, and bodice back,<br/>\nyou can pretty much change them to whatever design you need. If your<br/>\ndaughter is not familiar with sewing terminology, she will need to know<br/>\nsome basics. Show her what darts, pleats, gathers, seam allowance, etc<br/>\nis, and give her scraps of fabric to practice these skills with. To make<br/>\npatterns, I use rolls of white newsprint paper that you can get free from<br/>\nyour news printer. When they get close to the end of the roll, they just<br/>\nget rid of them. There is usually 80 feet or better left on them, plenty<br/>\nto make patterns. Making patterns is more easily shown than described, so<br/>\nhopefully you have enough basic sewing knowledge to get her through this<br/>\npart &lt;grin&gt;. If my end design is going to be made of expensive fabric, I<br/>\nfirst make the garment out of muslin, then make any changes necessary on<br/>\nthe pattern. I learned this the hard and expensive way.<br/>\n        If your daughter wants to learn more about marketing the<br/>\nfashions, *WWD* lists fashion show schedules. It also shows the trends<br/>\nand styles that will be prevalent the following year. You may want to<br/>\ntake her to a fashion show in New York, and let her see one in action.<br/>\nYou could also just take her to the garment district, I think around 5th<br/>\nAvenue.
