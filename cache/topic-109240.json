I&#39;ve been on the phone with some distraught mom when one of them needs <br/>\nme and I&#39;ve asked my kid to wait.   Overall, though, they know that their <br/>\nlives are already pretty sweet and some other kid&#39;s life might have gone from crap <br/>\nto better, which is a pretty big jump.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there&#39;s concern OR attack.   I&#39;m not worried about this <br/>\nemotional-support discussion at all.   I do think that the articles on deschooling <br/>\nand the recommendations about saying yes to children instead of no are <br/>\ntherapeutic in and of themselves.  Recovery is not and should not be something thought <br/>\nof as a whole body of work which must be done before the next step.   It&#39;s <br/>\nsomething ongoing.   If a person is too screwed up and wounded to take care of <br/>\nanother person&#39;s 24-hour-a-day needs, then something should be done THERE, not <br/>\nhere.   A child can&#39;t be put on the shelf and picked up again in a year or two <br/>\nwhen the mom&#39;s therapy is done.   They need mom NOW.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYears back, therapy was a deep analysis of all childhood memories and <br/>\nexperiences, along with analysis of what the parental background was.   That <br/>\nbenefited Freudian   therapists more than it benefited their patients.    They were <br/>\nlearning a LOT that they could use as therapists, but the patients were just <br/>\nwallowing in dredged up memories and not getting much in the way of practical <br/>\nadvice about what to do in the midst of those years of psychoanalysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays a much better idea is cognitive therapy--changing how we see the <br/>\nworld, and how we see ourselves in it, and living in a healthier and more hopeful <br/>\nand productive way.   &quot;Here&#39;s what you might try between now and next week&quot; <br/>\nis not something Freudian or Jungian analysts were prone to say, unless it was <br/>\na recommendation of how to dredge up or mine more history of pain and <br/>\nsuffering.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Being someone who CAN help can be a very excruciating thing, when you<br/>\nlive among thousands who need you.  Making decisions on whom to help,<br/>\nhow to help them, when to help them, takes a huge toll on the helpers<br/>\nand in fact eventually compromises their ability to help at all.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree.<br/>\nBeing someone who can help and doing so for free means getting to choose <br/>\none&#39;s method and approach.   Even those in private practice (as opposed to those <br/>\nwho have contracted to provide services through an agency with its own <br/>\nestablished mission statement and methods) can choose their own methods and <br/>\napproaches, even if they&#39;re charging big bucks to do it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do is helping anyone who comes across it.   I don&#39;t need to collect <br/>\nnames or statistics.   If I write an article or collect cool writings of others <br/>\nand make them available for people to read when and if they want to, that is a <br/>\nway to help people in which the &quot;when&quot; is up to them, and it doesn&#39;t take a <br/>\nhuge toll on me. (And usually the writing is therapeutic for me at the same <br/>\ntime.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I speak at a conference and 25 people or 150 people are in the room, maybe <br/>\nonly five or ten are really helped, but that&#39;s really not even between me and <br/>\nthem.   I was doing a dance (metaphorically speaking &lt;g&gt;) and telling some <br/>\njokes and maybe something will become the catalyst for a change they didn&#39;t even <br/>\nknow they needed to make, the the area of memory or recovery or understanding <br/>\nor inspiration.    I agreed to perform, they chose to attend, some weren&#39;t <br/>\nreally listening or didn&#39;t need what I was saying, some were listening just to fi<br/>\nnd something to hate, but a few maybe DID benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has really pissed me off a few times is someone coming to a forum or <br/>\ndiscussion list and going off because others won&#39;t give her exactly what she <br/>\nTHINKS she wants exactly the way she thinks she needs it.   I&#39;ve been insulted a <br/>\ndozen times or more on the charge that I probably am a big fraud, saying I&#39;m <br/>\npatient with my kids because I&#39;m not treating some random e-mailer the way I <br/>\nwould treat my own child.<br/>\n<br/>\n#1, the random e-mailer is NOT my child<br/>\n#2, the random e-mailer is not a child at all, and should buck up and show <br/>\nsome maturity<br/>\n#3, the randon e-mailer HAS a child (or maybe four) <br/>\n<br/>\nI have NO obligation to adopt everyone who comes by and treat her as my own <br/>\nchild.   And those who are sorely in need of the mothering of strangers might <br/>\nnot be emotionally prepared to be unschoolers.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Emotional support for new unschoolers","postDate":"1131054299","msgId":109294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhiLjMyYWZkYjU5LjMwOWJkZWRiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109293,"nextInTopic":109298,"prevInTime":109293,"nextInTime":109295,"topicId":109240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am grateful for <br/>\ntheir patience, their willingness to answer similar questions over <br/>\nand over, to share their own family&#39;s stories and hard-earned <br/>\nexperience, and for reading and typing thousands and thousands of <br/>\nwords each month  all for free.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight, I&#39;m not trying to discount what the list owners ALREADY are doing.  That in itself is a huge act of service &lt;g&gt;.  I too appreciate what they share.  It has been tremendously helpful to glean from their experiences.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This leads to the issue of &quot;it&#39;s not fair.&quot;  It&#39;s TOTALLY not fair <br/>\nthat some people have so much pain to sort through if they want to <br/>\nsuccessfully and joyfully attain unschooling.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I&#39;m talking about sometimes addressing this when it deems appropriate.  Sometimes it may or may not be appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I read posts where it&#39;s obvious that there is a lot of struggle and pain, I feel so sad for them, knowing that they have old stuff about authority and kids, and that they probably weren&#39;t raised with compassion.  I hate <br/>\nthat the world is so unfair, and I really really hate that 99.9% of the children on this planet bear the brunt of the injustice.  It makes me sick, and I actually cry about it often.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I think that it&#39;s very sad also.  And Unfortunately, even if it doesn&#39;t effect us directly.  It does effect our families indirectly.  We are constantly being exposed to it when we go out in &#39;real&#39; life.  As I&#39;ve heard (or read) Sandra say before, our families are a refuge.  That is the gift of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;However -  this does not mean Sandra (or I, or anyone) has to give <br/>\nanything away for free.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight, we all have choices.  Sandra and the other list owners have chosen, very unselfishly, to help other unschooling families.  That should definitly be recognized for what they give to others.  I&#39;m not trying to discount that at all and hope that it didn&#39;t come across that way.  I was just talking about maybe occassionally addressing the emotional component of unschooling on occassion.  (Maybe even the sometimes needed brutal honesty of telling someone that therapy might be needed to get over control issues or other stuff and that the list owners are unable to help with so much emotional baggage?)  This may come off as acknowleging that this is beyond what the list owners can emotionally give because this kind of stuff can be so draining and may seem apathetic to the people at times, but being honest about this kind of stuff is admirable and sometimes needs to be told.  And maybe (and probably) it is beyond what can be given in this unschooling list setting.   I guess what I&#39;m<br/>\n saying is that a parent&#39;s emotional baggage should be acknowlegded and encouraged to heal by whatever means that are available.  This &#39;review&#39; and acknowledgement often leads to healed parents and happier children.....the very goal of this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do think that unschooling can be an amazing path to healing.  I <br/>\nthink that anyone who wants to unschool (or own a yacht) has the <br/>\nright and the full potential to do so.  BUT I think that many (if not <br/>\nmost) people are going to need real-life, day to day, emotional <br/>\nsupport, in order to be able do it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Some people would sort it out by <br/>\nsheer brain-power, some people would join with others and sort it out <br/>\ntogether, most people would probably never sort it out at all.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s the current dilema for ru&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We do live in a world where human being&#39;s trustworthiness and <br/>\ncuriosity are systematically discouraged and shamed, and it will take <br/>\na million lifetimes to sort it all out.  I think there is hardly <br/>\nanything worth sorting out more, and my life is dedicated to this <br/>\nvery human process.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs are all of the list owners on this board.  That is a given.  The emotional aspect is an intrinsic part of the whole picture and may not always be addressed enough as the &quot;root&quot; of some of the problems faced by unschooling parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But I need to eat and buy toilet paper and pay for health insurance <br/>\ntoo.  And so (I imagine) does Sandra and the other leaders on this <br/>\nlist.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight, I don&#39;t think anyone wants any of the list owner&#39;s to sacrafice so much that they have nothing left over for their own families.  Maybe just the integration of addressing self-exploration and healing of parental baggage.  Maybe the concern is that this may seem too overt or as a personal attack?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Being someone who CAN help can be a very excruciating thing, when you <br/>\nlive among thousands who need you.  Making decisions on whom to help, <br/>\nhow to help them, when to help them, takes a huge toll on the helpers <br/>\nand in fact eventually compromises their ability to help at all.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight, I&#39;m sure that is tough and I cannot imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;BUT this does not deny the fact that this kind of help is DESPERATELY <br/>\nNEEDED.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, my point exactly!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So again I urge the new unschoolers who are struggling  <br/>\nplease!  find yourself someone who values unschooling, to hold your <br/>\nhand, hear your stories, and listen to your tears. You need emotional <br/>\nsupport, your children need you to get emotional support, your <br/>\nhusband needs you to get emotional support, the planet needs you to <br/>\nget emotional support. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nlol, YES!  Maybe the support in person is best, but a little acknowlegdment online couldn&#39;t hurt either.  Kind of like maybe someone with a similiar past experience of that particular issue can share.  That kind of sharing can be eye-opening for the person with the emotional baggage.  I personally have heard from people who need help with this and say that there is a great need for this. Heck, and I&#39;m no where nearly as experienced as the list owners with a ton of unschooling life experience, lol.  So yes, there is a huge need for addressing parental emotional baggage, especially when I see other new unschoolers asking me a lot of questions, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(I know that last part sounds like a pompous proposition, but I <br/>\nhappen to think it&#39;s true so I kept it in.)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNah...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKarri, Lindsay (4/16/02) and Camden (6/8/04)<br/>\n <br/>\nWe are students of words; we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and recitation rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing. <br/>\n--Ralph Waldo Emerson <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

One is that children have different emotional intelligences, and<br/>\nwhat one child might shrug off and be able to view with detachment, might be<br/>\nabsorbed and internalized, in a damaging way, by another - both the parent&#39;s<br/>\nemotional state and negative school stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue is that there is nothing here about the concept of offering<br/>\nthe choice to the child, with the freedom to change their mind at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe core of Unschooling *is* &quot;being present&quot; with your children. Jayn<br/>\nmirrors my emotional state back to me, no matter how I try not to impose my<br/>\nfeelings or bad mood on her. I do that by attempting to be really aware of<br/>\nmy state of mind, but I&#39;m not always fabulous at it. Her mirroring usually<br/>\nhelps me realize just how much negative projection I am engaging in - and<br/>\nI&#39;m not remotely near depressed. Just not &quot;taking it out&quot; on them, doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean that the kids aren&#39;t feeling an effect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, nor need &quot;home with miserable mom&quot; vs &quot;being miserable in school&quot;<br/>\nbe the only options. There might be a free school nearby, there might be<br/>\nways to attend college classes part of the time, there might be the<br/>\npossibility of visiting relatives for a brief time, there might be the<br/>\nability to bring someone else into the home situation to help out.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Although, if a person is sincere about unschooling (and actually &quot;gets<br/>\nit&quot;) and truly is just having personal issues coming up, I would&#39;nt say that<br/>\nemotional support should be overlooked or out of the question. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience here and on the sister lists has been that I have received a<br/>\nlot of emotional support at different times, when I have posted a problem -<br/>\nor as seems to happen in a magical way, someone else posts with a<br/>\ncommensurate issue just as I was about to! The support happens as a side<br/>\neffect of discussing problems of perception. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   I do think, though that sometimes parenting an unschooled child can<br/>\nbring up past childhood wounds for the parent.   Even though, I&#39;ve found<br/>\nthat unschooling is very healing for my own childhood wounds. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do a *lot* of this kind of conversation on AlwaysUnschooled. We do quite<br/>\na lot of it on Basics. Ren Allen has actually asked for specific stories of<br/>\npersonal/emotional healing instigated by Unschooling and mindful parenting,<br/>\nand revisits the topic periodically on Basics. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere really is a place for people having these emotional struggles as a<br/>\nresult of discovering Unschooling to share and receive empathy - especially<br/>\nif they are looking for reasons to keep Unschooling, rather than a kind of<br/>\npermission to drop it because it is too painful. Sometimes people respond to<br/>\npain by getting angry at the others on the lists, as if we caused it by<br/>\nopening their minds and hearts to Unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It is wonderful to see the happiness in my children&#39;s faces and be<br/>\npresent for the love that they eminate.  When I do think back to my own<br/>\nchildhood is still does make me sad. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe too - both of those ideas. I see my mother&#39;s family stretching back into<br/>\nthe ages with a pattern of abuse and severity and unkindness perpetuated. I<br/>\nsometimes envision myself as the bulwark holding back a thousand screaming<br/>\nmonsters with the faces of my mother and my horrid grandfather and his even<br/>\nmore wretched mother. It stops here.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Maybe the parent can be honest and tell the child that mom or dad is<br/>\nhaving a hard time.  I think honesty is very beneficial at these times. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to think honesty is beneficial at all times.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

That&#39;s a TOUGH one.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy email address and phone number are listed on my state organization  <br/>\nwebsite as a homeschooling contact person. I get one to three phone  <br/>\ncalls per day. Nearly ALL of them are from a desperate emotionally  <br/>\nupset very very needy parent. Nearly all of them need to tell me  <br/>\nabout their problems - nearly all of them have had truly horrible,  <br/>\nterrible, life-sucking, traumatic school experiences. Most are  <br/>\nhanging onto their belief in their own kids by a very slim thread.  <br/>\nMany times they cry, on the phone, just hearing me speaking of their  <br/>\nchild as a valuable, viable person - I cannot count how many of these  <br/>\nparents tell me, &quot;You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve spoken to about my son  <br/>\nin YEARS who hasn&#39;t thought of him as &quot;broken&quot; and pretty much not  <br/>\nfixable.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I hope people will stop and think about how much time these  <br/>\nphone calls take. The person often really truly MUST tell their full  <br/>\nand complete story, get it ALL out, before they can take a breath and  <br/>\nlisten and believe that I understand just how frustrated they are and  <br/>\nhow they&#39;ve tried everything else and how contacting homeschoolers is  <br/>\na last resort. I know, from experience, that if I don&#39;t listen and  <br/>\nmake it clear I understand, that they won&#39;t be ready to hear what I  <br/>\nhave to say. NONE of them have unschooling in mind when they call -  <br/>\nthey&#39;re just finally at the point of wanting to escape from the  <br/>\nschool situation. But, many times their child has been seriously hurt  <br/>\nby school and it is obvious to ME that they desperately need a  <br/>\nlengthy period of deschooling and then unschooling. And these parents  <br/>\nare often SO completely and totally angry with the whole school  <br/>\napproach that the very idea of unschooling hits them like a ton of  <br/>\nbricks and they say things like, &quot;Oh that would be heavenly, I can&#39;t  <br/>\nbelieve I&#39;m hearing you right, this is what I DREAMED of.....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can imagine how gratifying this is.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can also imagine how much time it takes and that there are  <br/>\ntimes my own children are standing there, watching me talk on the  <br/>\nphone, waiting and waiting and waiting to talk to me or needing me to  <br/>\ndo something for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t regret doing this at all. And my kids understand that this is  <br/>\nmy way of helping the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there has to be balance and we have to set limits. Sometimes  <br/>\nthere are people I don&#39;t call back because I feel like I&#39;ve said what  <br/>\nI could say to them and that the ball needs to be in their court. I  <br/>\nKNOW they need far more emotional support than I can provide and I  <br/>\nHOPE they find it, but it can&#39;t all come from me, clearly. I always  <br/>\ntry to help people find a local group and hope they&#39;ll find a friend  <br/>\nor two there who can give them the emotional support they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a great need for a national network of therapists  <br/>\nwho support unschooling - I know of one, only, and I do refer people  <br/>\nto her very frequently - she does phone, email, and in--person  <br/>\nconsultations. If someone is looking for a &quot;project,&quot; putting  <br/>\ntogether a list of unschooling-friendly therapists would certainly be  <br/>\na useful one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":79168236,"authorName":"Amy Childs","from":"&quot;Amy Childs&quot; &lt;amyc@...&gt;","profile":"aimmee36","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Emotional support for new unschoolers","postDate":"1131023438","msgId":109281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrZDI4ZSt0cGk3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwOC5kM2ZlNzJhLjMwOWEyYzM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109279,"nextInTopic":109282,"prevInTime":109280,"nextInTime":109282,"topicId":109240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... wind was a viable powersource, and her husband didn t want a yacht, and she lived in Montana, and she couldn t swim, and they couldn t afford a yacht, how","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1868324486\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If this were a yachting list and someone came who didn&#39;t believe <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wind was a viable powersource, and her husband didn&#39;t want a yacht, <br/>\nand she lived in Montana, and she couldn&#39;t swim, and they couldn&#39;t <br/>\nafford a yacht, how much response would be a waste of time?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great analogy, and it leads me to admit what I have been <br/>\nfeeling (as I ponder the idea of starting a different list for the <br/>\nemotional process), which is, I just don&#39;t feel like giving away so <br/>\nmuch of my time for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel embarrassed about saying that here in front of a few thousand <br/>\npeople, but I think it&#39;s important to say for the purposes of this <br/>\ndiscussion, for several reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, to acknowledge (again  but I think it bears repeating) how <br/>\nmuch time the leaders on this list give away.  I am grateful for <br/>\ntheir patience, their willingness to answer similar questions over <br/>\nand over, to share their own family&#39;s stories and hard-earned <br/>\nexperience, and for reading and typing thousands and thousands of <br/>\nwords each month  all for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads to the issue of &quot;it&#39;s not fair.&quot;  It&#39;s TOTALLY not fair <br/>\nthat some people have so much pain to sort through if they want to <br/>\nsuccessfully and joyfully attain unschooling.   When I read posts <br/>\nwhere it&#39;s obvious that there is a lot of struggle and pain, I feel <br/>\nso sad for them, knowing that they have old stuff about authority and <br/>\nkids, and that they probably weren&#39;t raised with compassion.  I hate <br/>\nthat the world is so unfair, and I really really hate that 99.9% of <br/>\nthe children on this planet bear the brunt of the injustice.  It <br/>\nmakes me sick, and I actually cry about it often.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever -  this does not mean Sandra (or I, or anyone) has to give <br/>\nanything away for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that unschooling can be an amazing path to healing.  I <br/>\nthink that anyone who wants to unschool (or own a yacht) has the <br/>\nright and the full potential to do so.  BUT I think that many (if not <br/>\nmost) people are going to need real-life, day to day, emotional <br/>\nsupport, in order to be able do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that Sandra&#39;s analogy would be even more apt if all <br/>\npeople were born near the water, and the yacht-resisting beliefs <br/>\n(like denying wind and the fear to swim) were overwhelmingly common, <br/>\ndue to a society that pervasively and systematically discouraged and <br/>\nshamed yachting from the minute a baby was born.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we lived in such a world, everything to do with yachting would be <br/>\nfraught with emotion and confusion.  Some people would sort it out by <br/>\nsheer brain-power, some people would join with others and sort it out <br/>\ntogether, most people would probably never sort it out at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do live in a world where human being&#39;s trustworthiness and <br/>\ncuriosity are systematically discouraged and shamed, and it will take <br/>\na million lifetimes to sort it all out.  I think there is hardly <br/>\nanything worth sorting out more, and my life is dedicated to this <br/>\nvery human process.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I need to eat and buy toilet paper and pay for health insurance <br/>\ntoo.  And so (I imagine) does Sandra and the other leaders on this <br/>\nlist.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing someone who CAN help can be a very excruciating thing, when you <br/>\nlive among thousands who need you.  Making decisions on whom to help, <br/>\nhow to help them, when to help them, takes a huge toll on the helpers <br/>\nand in fact eventually compromises their ability to help at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT this does not deny the fact that this kind of help is DESPERATELY <br/>\nNEEDED.

If there is physical or emotional abuse, I would say school IS a better place for the child.  If the parent is majorly going through emotional turmoil and just has trouble being in the present with the child and has sad or self-loathing feelings that are NOT being taken out on the child, I would say school is way more damaging to the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Homeschooling isn&#39;t for everyone.   Unschooling is for fewer still.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight, few can imagine homeschooling and spending all of that time with their children (God forbid!) and never getting any break from them.   Unschooling &lt;gasp&gt; is even more of a leap.  They may actually have to trust their children and relinquish parental controls and expectations. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If this were a yachting list and someone came who didn&#39;t believe wind was a <br/>\nviable powersource, and her husband didn&#39;t want a yacht, and she lived in <br/>\nMontana, and she couldn&#39;t swim, and they couldn&#39;t afford a yacht, how much response <br/>\nwould be a waste of time?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, I know what you mean.  They really have to be at least sincere about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When someone comes to a list like this and thinks some things have to be <br/>\ntaught, and that parenting isn&#39;t an issue, and her husband doesn&#39;t understand it a <br/>\nbit, and she needs to work full time, I don&#39;t feel obligated to try to get <br/>\nher life in order.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight, this probably is not the list for trying to find which way to go (i.e. school, homeschool or unschool).  Although, if a person is sincere about unschooling (and actually &quot;gets it&quot;) and truly is just having personal issues coming up, I would&#39;nt say that emotional support should be overlooked or out of the question.  I know what you are saying about reviewing too much is standing in the way of the present or the relationship/good feelings for the child.  The whole goal of unschooling is a wonderful relationship with our children in the present.  I agree that this advanced unschooling list should make and keep that as a priority.  I do think, though that sometimes parenting an unschooled child can bring up past childhood wounds for the parent.   Even though, I&#39;ve found that unschooling is very healing for my own childhood wounds.  It is wonderful to see the happiness in my children&#39;s faces and be present for the love that they eminate.  When I do think back to my own childhood is<br/>\n still does make me sad.  I&#39;m sure that depending on the severity of an abusive childhood it&#39;s something that never totally goes away.  Thus, someone who suffered even worse may have a hard time being in the present if they have unresolved personal issues, despite making a clear commitment to unschooling and unconditional love towards their children.  I remind myself that I am changing my families&#39; legacy and that my children will have the freedom to grow into whomever they want with full support and love from both of their parents.  That in itself is very freeing and helps me be focused in the present.  I think that getting to that place in the beginning is sometime hard for a &quot;needy&quot; parent, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible or necessarily warrants a child having to be put into school.  I know that you did say &quot;might be better off&quot;, so you did leave that open for discression.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Many of the first steps need to be taken elsewhere.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nO.k. but what about the unschooling parent that has been doing it for several years and has emotional baggage beginning to come up?  It may or may not be triggered by certain life&#39;s events or circumstances.  Maybe they&#39;ve realized that the reason that they are having certain problems in certain areas of unschooling is because emotional baggage hasn&#39;t been fully dealt with.  What then?  I just wouldn&#39;t want them to put the kid in school at this point, unless the child is asking to be.  Maybe the parent can be honest and tell the child that mom or dad is having a hard time.  I think honesty is very beneficial at these times.  Children that are shown compassion and understanding, generally can show that in return to a loving parent.  Also, what a great thing for a kid to know that even mom or dad have different emotions coming up every now and then.  And maybe it can be discussed openly and honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Being emotionally prepared to own a yacht isn&#39;t even nearly enough.   People <br/>\nneed to start with a little sailboat and know what they&#39;re doing, and believe <br/>\nsails can work, and discover whether they&#39;re the kind of person who can <br/>\noperate sails and take care of the equipment and withstand being on a boat for days <br/>\nat a time.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting analogy.  I agree parents need to take steps to see if this is the way to go for their families.  The ones that do decide that this is the way to go for may sometimes need to sort things out, in regards to their feelings of the life they have chosen for themselves.  Things come up.  Life happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is it &quot;not fair&quot; that some people have yachts and others don&#39;t?   Is it &quot;not <br/>\nfair&quot; that the Unsers have race cars when some others in Albuquerque don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a car at all?   When we&#39;re touching on emotional issues, sometimes there <br/>\ncomes a wave of &quot;that&#39;s not fair,&quot; and that&#39;s not fair to the list as a whole.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, well right, life IS not fair.  Your commentary is very well thought out and I know that the list is focused on helping unschoolers live better lives.  Part of that may or may not include emotional support for veteran unschooling parents and maybe even on occasion a new, but comitted radical unschooling parent.  I see that you want to keep the exploratory &quot;looky-lou&#39;s&quot; away.  That is a waste of your time.  I understand not wanting to &quot;clutter-up&quot; the list.  You have set up a great arena for other unschoolers to lead happier, care free lives.  Living is the present is key.  Sometimes people faulter emotionally.  The goal should always be happiness and love for our children.  I don&#39;t think that anyone is questioning that.  Maybe emotional struggles can be touched upon, but with a gentle reminder of the avoidance of projecting it on to our children?  That (projecting) is definitely something to be avoided.  I understand that you don&#39;t want to let any parental baggage to take away<br/>\n from the joy and love of our children and that you are in this for the children.  If the parent is able to overcome this (emotional baggage), it just brings more advantages to the child.  The children probably benefit from a parent receiving emotional support from fellow unschoolers.  I know in the interum it may be a bit uncomfortable for the child, but I think if the parent is open and honest and loving, it does not harm and may even be a tool of compassion for another human being.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nO.k. you got me to come out of lurkdom again, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Karri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKarri, Lindsay (4/16/02) and Camden (6/8/04)<br/>\n <br/>\nWe are students of words; we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and recitation rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing. <br/>\n--Ralph Waldo Emerson <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

He had been to a conference where drug-rehab <br/>\ncounsellors were, and saw the version of the Certificate of Empowerment that <br/>\nthe author of the Procovery book has used (it&#39;s been on her website for many <br/>\nyears, and that&#39;s cool--she made good use of it).   He was talking to some of his <br/>\nfellow counsellors about whether I might have come from a recovery <br/>\nbackground, from clues in things he knew of my writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did go to Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings for four years, from when I <br/>\nwas childless up to when Marty was one or so.   In there I also went to some <br/>\nAA meetings with my mom, when she didn&#39;t want to go alone, or when she got a <br/>\ncoin/token, or it was too snowy to drive home and come back to get her.   So I <br/>\nsaw a few of the really hardcore meetings that AA can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that bears a similarity between a type of advice there and here is <br/>\nthat the harmful things need to be ceased.    If someone comes here and says <br/>\n&quot;When we finish this curriculum we have, we&#39;re going to think about maybe <br/>\neasing into unschooling,&quot; she&#39;s not ready for this list yet.   If she wants to let <br/>\nthat curriculum go and start unschooling, then we can help her.   Otherwise, <br/>\nit would be like someone going to an AA meeting and saying &quot;When my liquor <br/>\ncabinet is empty, and after the Christmas and New Year&#39;s parties, I&#39;m going to <br/>\nquit drinking, so I would like to come to meetings now and share every week even <br/>\nthough I&#39;m actively finishing off my Scotch and tequila.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn AA, people usually have sponsors, which is a one-on-one relationship.    <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the kind of sponsors even new unschoolers need might be those <br/>\nkinds--other moms at La Leche League, or maybe someone at a group for codependency <br/>\nor something like Al-Anon, where people are recovering from substance abuse of <br/>\nthe parents or other relatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither this list nor unschooling itself can or should be everything to <br/>\nanybody.   Learning from the real world works the same way for adults as for <br/>\nchildren.    Use resources that are out there!   If dumping and reviewing all that <br/>\nhappened during childhood is what&#39;s needed, find a counsellor who can help you <br/>\nlook at it in those terms--if your current reactions and   self image are <br/>\nstill school-based, you should try to clean that internal mess up!   It will make <br/>\na difference.   <br/>\n<br/>\n(From Amy&#39;s long and wonderful post:)<br/>\n-=-I don&#39;t know where to tell new unschoolers to go for this kind of<br/>\nemotional support.  Maybe you will be lucky and have a best friend,<br/>\nsibling or parent, who fully understands your struggle and will<br/>\nsupport you along the way.  Maybe you will find a therapist who<br/>\nunderstands unschooling and who will midwife you through your<br/>\nemotional process to your new life.  I have seen advertisements for<br/>\nunschooling-friendly therapists in *Life Learning* magazine, and<br/>\nperhaps they could be a wonderful resource for a phone connection. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s might be a good idea too, for someone with no local contacts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe finding a partner and reading through some of what&#39;s already written, <br/>\nwhether some of Joyce&#39;s very logical answers or my more emotionally-based <br/>\nessays, would be helpful too.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I often see people try to overcome emotional struggle using<br/>\nintellectual rigor.  Sometimes that works. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think some people want all personal exploration without borrowing from <br/>\nalready-been-there experiences, and that can be slow and frustrating.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think some people want all borrowings with no personal exploration, and <br/>\nthat won&#39;t work.   That&#39;s like reading about the bike riding without getting the <br/>\nbike, or reading fifty cookbooks but never turning on the stove, or collecting <br/>\nsewing patterns but not ever buying any cloth.   You don&#39;t sew or cook from <br/>\nreading.   You don&#39;t unschool or come to trust natural learning from reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling starts to make sense when people are unschooling.   It takes some <br/>\nreading and some doing, more reading, more doing...<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Emotional support for new unschoolers","postDate":"1130878747","msgId":109241,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0NS44NzJlLjMwOTkzMTFiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109240,"nextInTopic":109242,"prevInTime":109240,"nextInTime":109242,"topicId":109240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The original of this topic is from Amy Childs who sent this post: FROM: amyc@worldlynx.net DATE: Tue, 01 Nov 2005 19:55:34 -0000 SUBJECT: emotional support for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-418100128\">The original of this topic is from Amy Childs<br/>\nwho sent this post:<br/>\n<br/>\nFROM: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:amyc@...\">amyc@...</a><br/>\nDATE: Tue, 01 Nov 2005 19:55:34 -0000<br/>\nSUBJECT: emotional support for new unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\nOops, I think I forgot to sign my post.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amy Childs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":79168236,"authorName":"Amy Childs","from":"&quot;Amy Childs&quot; &lt;amyc@...&gt;","profile":"aimmee36","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Emotional support for new unschoolers","postDate":"1130874697","msgId":109240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrOGgwOStzNWNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":109241,"prevInTime":109239,"nextInTime":109241,"topicId":109240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I really appreciate that this list exists.

I appreciate that the <br/>\nowners and other long-time unschoolers are so generous with their <br/>\ntime, their knowledge and experience, that they are willing to answer <br/>\nso many questions, over and over again, in a thousand slightly <br/>\ndifferent ways.  I am grateful that an easy forum exists, for free, <br/>\nwhere we can gather and store so much useful information about <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that I have seen again and again, between the lines of the <br/>\nmessages here, is the emotional process that most people go through, <br/>\non their way into unschooling.  (I am a therapist/life-coach, and so <br/>\nthe inner journey is always the part that speaks the loudest to me.)  <br/>\nThere is so much that this list offers to people to people in this <br/>\nprocess.  This is a place to find new ideas, a place to have mistaken <br/>\nbeliefs challenged, a place where harmful patterns are exposed.  This <br/>\ncreates an opportunity to replace old ways of thinking with new ones <br/>\nthat are more conducive to the trust, freedom and joy that so many of <br/>\nus experience (or want to experience) as unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is missing from this list (and there is no way to add it, this <br/>\nis not a complaint but an observation), is the real human tender <br/>\nconnection that most people need when they are doing the work of re-<br/>\nevaluating, exposing old wounds, and committing to a new way of <br/>\nlife.  To move from the belief that children cannot be trusted, that <br/>\nlearning only happens when forced and that children are not full <br/>\nhuman beings  to a place of trust in the inner selves of our <br/>\nchildren (not to mention ourselves, and all people) requires a deep <br/>\nshift in our psyche.  In my experience, this shift is simply not <br/>\npossible without going through all kinds of emotional pain and <br/>\nstruggle, and I have seen countless messages on this list testify to <br/>\nthis fundamental reality. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis new birth  of unschooling- requires a labor of sorts, and what <br/>\nI want to say here is that laboring women need midwives.  There is a <br/>\nlot we can do to learn about birth  new ideas, good suggestions, <br/>\ninformation that helps us understand birth  all of this intellectual <br/>\nwork can help women immensely.  But when the real labor pain hits, <br/>\nall the &quot;facts&quot; of the situation are of no help at all, in comparison <br/>\nto the midwife who looks at us in the eyes, wipes our brow, and holds <br/>\nour hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want new unschoolers (and all of us) to understand, that as <br/>\nwonderful and irreplaceable as this list is for providing a place to <br/>\ndiscuss and learn about unschooling, it is not a replacement for the <br/>\nreal-life emotional support that most (if not all) of us need on this <br/>\njourney.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read new unschoolers questions, I can&#39;t help but hear the <br/>\nanguish behind their words.  I want to reach out to them, to hold <br/>\nthem while they cry, to listen to their hearts speak, to comfort <br/>\ntheir fears and release their shame.  But this is a yahoo list, a <br/>\ncomputer screen, a series of 1s and 0s that does an amazing job of <br/>\ncommunicating thoughts around the world.  It really is not the forum <br/>\nfor touching skin to skin, or wiping away tears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know where to tell new unschoolers to go for this kind of <br/>\nemotional support.  Maybe you will be lucky and have a best friend, <br/>\nsibling or parent, who fully understands your struggle and will <br/>\nsupport you along the way.  Maybe you will find a therapist who <br/>\nunderstands unschooling and who will midwife you through your <br/>\nemotional process to your new life.  I have seen advertisements for <br/>\nunschooling-friendly therapists in *Life Learning* magazine, and <br/>\nperhaps they could be a wonderful resource for a phone connection.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI often see people try to overcome emotional struggle using <br/>\nintellectual rigor.  Sometimes that works.  But if you are someone <br/>\nwho is in emotional struggle, and if the answers on this list aren&#39;t <br/>\nhelping you get to the bottom of your pain, I want you to know that <br/>\nthis is neither because of your or the list&#39;s failure.  It is because <br/>\nyou need something that this list doesn&#39;t (and never claimed to) <br/>\nprovide.   I encourage you to find someone who will be your midwife <br/>\nat your side, as you give birth to something precious and wonderful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I think you&#39;ll find that the labor was worth it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109507,"nextTopicId":109543}}
