We actually went to the 4th of July festical thing they had this year just last Friday and had a lovely time.  The Krispy Kreme shop was a great addition to Concord - we got a dozen last weekend!<br/>\n <br/>\nWhile Rory is too young to be James&#39; new best friend, LOL, he *loves* being around other kids of any age and I&#39;d like to get together some time!  I&#39;ve taken the suggestions from here to heart about seeing other home and unschoolers in action.  Dan would probably be a little hesitant to meet crazy internet strangers w/o me around to bridge the gap - but he&#39;s open and wouldn&#39;t mind once we all get to know each other.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe Lindsey is on my weekend trip list - I&#39;m not sure how much enjoyment Rory would get out of it at this point, but we&#39;re going to give it a shot.  We&#39;ve also been meaning to go to Habitot in Berkeley.  Supposed to be really cool for the little ones.<br/>\n <br/>\nI haven&#39;t heard of the Trivalley Explorers - how do I get in touch with them?<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and feel free to email me offlist - I&#39;d love to chat more about local things to do and arrange a get together at a park or something.<br/>\n <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Cool!
