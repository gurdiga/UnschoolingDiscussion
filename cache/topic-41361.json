If we are able to use them to<br/>\n&gt; choose a public school and the government &quot;lets us&quot; home unschool why<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t we get our money and use it at home? Michele<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This question begs the better solution of separating the government from<br/>\neducation altogether so that money would not be taken by force from people<br/>\nwho do not use the schools. If we kept our own money, we could spend it for<br/>\nour own children&#39;s education as we see best.  Wow, what a concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short -- because the teachers&#39; unions run the schools, and they know that<br/>\nevery dollar that goes to vouchers is less for them. Since the teachers&#39;<br/>\nunions contribute heavily to the elections of school-supporting politicians,<br/>\nthe politicians hold the purse strings of tax money, and give every<br/>\nadvantage to those unions in return for their contributions. It&#39;s simple<br/>\nbribery.<br/>\n<br/>\nA famous remark by Albert Shanker, the former head of the AFT (American<br/>\nFederation of Teachers, the second largest teachers&#39; union) was, &quot;When<br/>\nhomeschoolers start paying teacher union dues, that&#39;s when this union will<br/>\nstart working for them.&quot;   (the quote might not be exact)<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41356,"nextTopicId":41303}}
