I have never had my kids send thank you cards for what they get as gifts. They always ofcourse verbally say thank you to each of the people. I wouldnt force them to do it, after all it is their right to decline if they want. Have you asked them if this is something they want to do? And could you enlighten me on why you feel it is so important? I&#39;ve always been curious as to why people make such a big deal out of little pieces of paper that say thank you....Is this something that has been passed down by your mother?

Where do I find the balance between forcing them to<br/>\ndo this and doing it all myself?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Jayn&#39;s last birthday (5) we did two different kinds of cards. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the adults, older children, and distant family who had sent gifts by<br/>\nmail, Jayn drew a picture related to the theme of the party which I scanned<br/>\nand turned into multiple copies of a notecard using card creating computer<br/>\ngraphics software. This year it was a beautiful mermaid. I then did the<br/>\ntext, taking the opportunity to hand write a short letter to the distant<br/>\nrelatives. I invited Jayn to write her name on the end, an activity she<br/>\nusually enjoys, and she did do so on most of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the core group of Jayn&#39;s friends, young (mostly) girls she sees<br/>\nregularly, she had the idea to make individual cards. I had every intention<br/>\nof using the scanned picture card, but no - Jayn wanted to draw a portrait<br/>\nof each of these friends and write in each one. So there were about eight<br/>\ncards to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prepared folded paper and over several weeks, usually the night before<br/>\ndance class when we would be seeing the girls, Jayn would do one or two of<br/>\nthese cards. She took a lot of care with the pictures, and wrote variations<br/>\nof &quot;Thank You {Name} Jayn&quot;. I then put them into envelopes and added the<br/>\nname to the front.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage to this approach is that with the local girls, I was able to<br/>\njust let the Moms know in person that a card was on its way, so no-one felt<br/>\nslighted. So many of Jayn&#39;s friends have birthdays within a month, and we<br/>\nwere all joking with each other that the thank yous back and forth would<br/>\narrive around Christmas. Meanwhile people who might be more concerned with<br/>\nthe etiquette of receiving timely thanks still receive something with Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nart work attached. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe will do something similar I would expect with the Christmas gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Mailed gifts (usually  money) <br/>\nget a phone call or a thank you note---stating what they spent  (or will spend) <br/>\nit on. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Cameron went Australia, we actually sent out requests for money to  help <br/>\nfinance the trip (it was a Student Ambassadorship with People to People).  <br/>\nCameron had a BUNCH of notes to write. We made them with stickers of kangaroos  <br/>\nand boomerangs, and inside I made straight pencil lines and actually  wrote <br/>\nthe thank you&#39;s with pencil. He came back and wrote over them with a nice  pen. <br/>\nWe then erased the pencil marks and lines.<br/>\n <br/>\nI figured this way he would, by osmosis &lt;g&gt;, learn how and what  to write. <br/>\nIt&#39;s his handwriting----just over mine.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt seemed the least painful way to do it. In some, we included a  darling <br/>\nphoto of him with a koala.<br/>\n <br/>\nI send out a good many thank you&#39;s, so they see me do it (without  <br/>\ncomplaining). Ben sends his share of business thank you&#39;s too, so he&#39;s modeling  it as <br/>\nwell. I just make it as easy as possible, so that it doesn&#39;t seem painful  and <br/>\npointless.
