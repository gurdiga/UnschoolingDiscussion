We&#39;re just like everybody else, only a<br/>\nfair bit wierder!  &lt;g&gt;  I was &quot;properly trained&quot; on cello and piano, and<br/>\nlearned violin by myself.  Guess which one I have the most fun playing....!<br/>\nHere&#39;s the absolutes I can think of:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  You have to spend time playing.  Call it practicing if you like, but you<br/>\ndon&#39;t get any better if you don&#39;t spend time with the instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  You get better faster with some sort of advice.  Find somebody who&#39;s<br/>\nbetter than you, and go see them periodically.  Lots of people like to do<br/>\nthis weekly, but if semi-annually is better for you, fine.  (I&#39;ve had 3<br/>\nviolin lessons in 5 years, and like it that way, thanks!)<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  You get better a whole lot faster if you think about what you do.<br/>\nPracticing with a comic book on the music stand instead of music (like I did<br/>\nin middle school) does not help!  Thinking about how you feel and whether<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re doing feels good or bad, natural or unatural, comfortable or<br/>\nuncomfortable, and what you can do to improve the things you don&#39;t like<br/>\nhelps a whole lot.  (In my experience, most people get steps 1 & 2 and<br/>\ntotally miss this one.)<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  No matter how good you get, there will always be somebody younger and<br/>\nbetter.  So what.  If you&#39;re not in it for the fun of it, get out!<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  Just like anything else, you will learn by leaps and plateaus.  Some<br/>\ndays it&#39;s hard to pick up the music because you feel stuck in the desert and<br/>\nit&#39;s too hard.  This too shall eventually pass; see #1!<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Music notation is a system of writing.  It&#39;s not any more complicated<br/>\nthan regular writing, but it has different rules.  Learn the rules and your<br/>\nlife is easier.  However, there is lots of learning that can be done outside<br/>\nknowing how to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow&#39;s that?  I&#39;ve always wondered if one could teach cello by email; wanna<br/>\ntry?  ;)  I love your list -- which wind instrument?  Someday I&#39;m going to<br/>\nlearn oboe; it&#39;s been on my list since college.

Look at it this way: there are 100&#39;s of method books out<br/>\nthere, and most teachers pick one they like.  And it works (at least to an<br/>\nextent).  But every teacher picks a different one, and those work, too.  So<br/>\nwhat difference would it make if Pam&#39;s daughter learned all her violin<br/>\ntechnique from her favorite broadway showtunes or from an incredibly dull<br/>\ntome like Dont, which is a great method book, should you like method books.<br/>\n(I don&#39;t, and therefore I don&#39;t Dont!)  Just because the tunes are fun<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean she should play them badly and learn bad habits.

I&#39;ve played The Music Man enough times now to know it cold, but I<br/>\nalways have to laugh at the best joke in the show, in my mind, which is<br/>\nmusical, not verbal.  When Professor Harold Hill is getting everybody riled<br/>\nup about having a boys&#39; band, he starts to sing the famous &quot;76 Trombones&quot;<br/>\nsong.  The very first time the tune is introduced, (76 Trombones led the big<br/>\nparade, etc.), it&#39;s with voice and *violin*.

The teacher can <br/>\nstill help her avoid the habits that will interfere with most kinds of <br/>\nplaying, but it wouldn&#39;t need to be nearly as rigid.  For instance, <br/>\nlearning scales can really help a person&#39;s playing.  I&#39;m doing them now on <br/>\nthe cello because I want to make it easier to play what I want to <br/>\nplay.
