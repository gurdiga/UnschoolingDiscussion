I will leave<br/>\nhere knowing that unschooling is most certainly different from family to<br/>\nfamily, and that there should be freedom of expression. <br/>\nI can see too that there are a few ladies here that feel it&#39;s their<br/>\ncalling to define unschooling in only their terms and to reject loudly<br/>\nthe valid opinions of another&#39;s method of unschooling. This is sad,<br/>\nsince unschooling is so diverse and in my personal research I have found<br/>\nthat it has MANY different meanings to many different people.<br/>\nI hope that this list evolves in such a way that tolerance is the<br/>\nfoundation and that dogma, when it comes to an individual family choice<br/>\nin education, is discarded.<br/>\nTHERE IS NO ONE WAY TO UNSCHOOL! :O) OR TO EDUCATE FOR THAT MATTER:O)<br/>\nUnfortunately this list is WAY too busy for me and I dont think that I<br/>\ncan even go to the site and read all of it.<br/>\nI&#39;m amazed at those women who can hang out with their kids, take care of<br/>\ntheir husbands and homes and still be so active here!
