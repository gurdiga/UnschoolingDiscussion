We (dh<br/>\nand me,<br/>\n&gt; plus 4 sons aged 19, 16, 13 & 10) have just mooved to a 16 acre block of<br/>\nland,<br/>\n&gt; which is about 12 - 13 acres native bush (forest? woodlands? - these don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really describe it properly) with a stream running through the middle of<br/>\nit. We<br/>\n&gt; are living in the garage plus room that we built before we moved, and are<br/>\nnow<br/>\n&gt; trying to build the house, but the weather has been rain, rain, rain. (It<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; winter here in New Zealand) The only animals we have so far are the 2<br/>\nrabbits<br/>\n&gt; and cat we brought with us, and a delightful puppy ds #3 got for his 13th<br/>\n&gt; birthday 2 weeks ago. As vegetarians, we aren&#39;t planning on animals beyond<br/>\n&gt; poultry for eggs, and a few goats to keep the gorse down. As Karen says,<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have much in the way of wild animals here in NZ but we are<br/>\npriveleged to<br/>\n&gt; have a pair of keruru or native pigeon, living in our bush. These are very<br/>\n&gt; large and lovely birds, which are protected now, but are still poached by<br/>\n&gt; people who find them good eating.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are about to start planting trees and are looking forward to getting<br/>\nour<br/>\n&gt; gardens started come spring.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anita Bower wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have 15.5 acres in southeastern Pennsylvania:  meadow, pasture,<br/>\nwoods,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pond, barn, house.
