We aren&#39;t vegetarians (but are trying to eat healthier), but we do family bed, I stay at home, am planning to let Accalia decide when she wants to stop nursing, use cloth diapers, and are currently deciding to hold off on any more immunizations until we&#39;re more fully informed about the risks. I like to think that by us going against the &quot;norm&quot; with some of these parenting issues we&#39;re already teaching Accalia to be more open about the possibilities around her.

La Leche league is mother to mother <br/>\nbreastfeeding support, through group meetings and telephone support.  I have <br/>\nbeen involved in LLL for 3 yrs, 2 kids, 4 moved, & the decision to stay at <br/>\nhome. Almost all of my best friends I have met throught LLL.  I have been a <br/>\nleader for 1 1/2 yrs and learned about attachment parenting through there.  <br/>\nAlthough, not everyone there (involved in LLL) AP&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any more questions, I would be happy to answer them.  They do <br/>\nhave a great site, though.  I don&#39;t read anything unless LLL has approved it <br/>\nfor their libraries.  It saves me tons of time, weeding out books that don&#39;t <br/>\nmesh with my personal philosphy, plus I get the books from the group and I <br/>\nget to keep them for a month.  If the library is slow, sometime two months. <br/>\nhee hee hee<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find a local group by checking out their site or calling <br/>\n1-800-laleche. BTW, their address and other great websites is in my signature.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy, thanks for the website on UU.  I went to a church for the first time <br/>\ntoday, but did not realize that is what you were talking about until I was <br/>\nright in the middle of it.  So you all went to church with me this <br/>\nmorning.....hee hee hee.....  I liked it. Very different.  I am going to <br/>\ncheck out the site, but I would love to hear your thoughts.  I am very open <br/>\nminded when I hear other express their thoughts or feelings on something, so <br/>\nfeel free. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, better run, I just got my little ones down for a nap and it is 3:30 <br/>\nYIKES!
