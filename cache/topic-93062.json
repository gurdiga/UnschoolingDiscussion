Thanks so much for your response to the &quot;math&quot; question.  I shared your original post and this reply with my husband.  It was a great opportunity to support what i&#39;ve been doing and for him to see other&#39;s who have had similar struggles as our own.   In response to his anxiety at times throughout the years I have succumbed to non-unschooling moments setting aside time for &quot;learning activities&quot; specifically math and reading based on his requirements not my dd&#39;s requests or interest.  Due to the absurdity of this approach - inevitably and fortunately these moments don&#39;t last long...

I&#39;d have to say it was the unschooling exception I <br/>\ntried to make of it. <br/>\n<br/>\n       She is our first-born, and I am a recovering public school <br/>\nprofessional &lt;grin&gt; so I pushed some arithmetic workbooks on her at one point, afraid she <br/>\nwas really &quot;behind&quot; in that one area. That, and some ill-fated music lessons <br/>\n-- piano and violin -- when counting out the note values interfered with her <br/>\ninterest in the exquisite sounds she wanted to make. The counting and numbers <br/>\ngot in her way rather than helping her, so she resented them and the attention <br/>\ngrown-ups kept insisting she pay to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I really thought it was the opposite, that the numbers would help her <br/>\ndo what she wanted to do. Which is true, but it just doesn&#39;t matter if what <br/>\nshe learns is to avoid and dislike anything that looks like &quot;math.&quot; So I did <br/>\nsome wrong things for right reasons, things I dearly wish I could take back!<br/>\n<br/>\n       Having said that, I do think different individuals have different <br/>\naffinities, things they&#39;re drawn to and things that don&#39;t resonate so easily with <br/>\ntheir own intelligences and perceptions. My daughter was never going to love <br/>\nnumbers like my son does, or like she loves books and the arts, whether I <br/>\npushed or not. But you asked about the &quot;phobic&quot; nature of her reaction to math, and <br/>\nI do think I contributed to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Fortunately, at long last, we seem to be finding small unschooling <br/>\nopportunities for her to begin reconsidering this. So that&#39;s my answer as an <br/>\nunschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\n       But as a professional educator and analyst, I just read something <br/>\nabout desensitizing people with real phobias, some scientific evidence suggesting <br/>\nthat one massive exposure to arouse maximum fear was a faster, more effective <br/>\nway to extinguish a phobic response than the traditional therapy of gradually <br/>\nintroducing small, well-tolerated doses of the fear factor over time. I was <br/>\npicturing not learning math but spiders and cliffs at the time, and thought it <br/>\nsounded so horrible that I personally would rather live with the phobia. But as <br/>\na scientific question ONLY -- I wonder how that would fit with whatever we <br/>\ndid with arithmetic workbooks (was that math as an aggravating allergen, or a <br/>\ndesensitizing dose at that point? If I had made a whole week of math misery, <br/>\nlike the way John Rosemond recommends toilet training, would that have had the <br/>\nsame effect as overcoming response through a massive does? Et cetera.)<br/>\n<br/>\n       I don&#39;t know those answers, and barely can even think of reasonable <br/>\nquestions to frame! But I find thinking about it all is irresistible, and I&#39;m <br/>\nbeginning to see that same tendency in DD.  <br/>\n<br/>\n       So although it may happen much later than had I handled things <br/>\ndifferently, I now predict (with secret delight) she will seize math by the throat <br/>\nand demand that it help her do this!
