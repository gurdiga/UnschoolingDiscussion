Problem was he didn&#39;t do math they <br/>\nway they did it nor did he want to. So, they, the school said he was LD in math <br/>\nalso. Why? They never once got that he did it in his head instead they accused <br/>\nhim of &quot;cheating&quot; with a calculator.  I did ask a few times why a paper was <br/>\nwrong and they said he didn&#39;t show the work.  (like he was secretly tapping <br/>\naway on a calculator in class, they where not allowed)<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I brought him home that I noticed his actual method.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he has a figure he needs to do he does it in his head.  Multiplication <br/>\ntables and memorizing them was difficult for him. He had his own way of the big <br/>\npicture in his head not their one way teaches all.  Funny thing is he can do <br/>\ndivision and fractions but when asked x tables he goes blank.  I noticed this <br/>\nwhen he was trying to cook something and the measuring cup was missing so he <br/>\nneeded use a different one but was trying to figure out where to make up the <br/>\ndifference. I suggested the way I knew/learned in school and he went blank and <br/>\nsaid Mom, I got it!
