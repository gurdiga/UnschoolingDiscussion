But I think it&#39;s worth telling again.  When people leave the <br/>\nsystem of institutional school, either ps, or private or even school-<br/>\nat-home, most of them need to deschool.  Some of them do this <br/>\ngradually, letting go of a little structure here and there until they <br/>\nsimply don&#39;t use it anymore.  Others, especially those more <br/>\ndamaged by a system which they just don&#39;t fit, need to deschool <br/>\n&#39;cold turkey.&#39;  (appropriate, for the time of year, huh?  *grin*)  And <br/>\nI&#39;m talking about parents, too, sometimes (I know in my case) <br/>\nmuch more than the children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, this means that a fallow period is necessary, with no <br/>\nexpectations on anyone&#39;s side, some people suggest 6 months, <br/>\nsom a year, like a &#39;trial period&#39; when anything goes.  Some children <br/>\nwill refuse to do anything which even whiffs of school, your son is <br/>\nreading, at least!  And there are plenty of Pokemon fans out there <br/>\n(adult ones, I mean) who can tell you the value of reading a <br/>\nPokemon book, in fact, one of the tenets of unschooling, I think, is <br/>\nthat there&#39;s no such thing as an &#39;unreal&#39; book (ie one which is not <br/>\n&#39;real&#39;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m sounding preachy, but you both sound normal!  <br/>\nHe needs to do what ne needs to do, and only he knows that.  You <br/>\nare used to perceiving value in only certain kinds of learning, <br/>\nknowledge, which comes from schooling.  So take the time out, <br/>\nboth of you, and deschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Dawn and I just subscribed to this loop today.  I have many<br/>\n&gt; questions about unschooling.  I just began to homeschool my ds who is<br/>\n&gt; 8 on November 1st.  He has Add and is highly gifted (IQ165) and school<br/>\n&gt; was horrific.  He was bored and basically tortured and teased daily by<br/>\n&gt; kids and the so-called &quot;adults&quot; who didnt understand him or care to<br/>\n&gt; try.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am very interested in unschooling but I am not sure how to implement<br/>\n&gt; it correctly.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Let me give you a quik rundown of what we do now:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I went to Barnes & Noble & bought a bunch of workbooks (with his help)<br/>\n&gt; and we pretty much use them intermittently as a gauge of where he is. <br/>\n&gt; He uses many computer programs, (Carmen Sandiego Usa & World,<br/>\n&gt; Jupstart, Math Blaster) and other learning devices such as Turbo Twist<br/>\n&gt; math.  We also use lots of books, some we already had, some given as<br/>\n&gt; gifts and library books.  I have let him choose the direction with<br/>\n&gt; those materials.  However, if I dont direct him in some way with<br/>\n&gt; guidelines, he would spend the day playing nintendo and game boy with<br/>\n&gt; pokemon games.  For example, today he told me he was going to read<br/>\n&gt; (yeah!) but he chose reading the Pokemon Silver handbook.  I gently<br/>\n&gt; told him I would like to see him read a real book - he resisted - but<br/>\n&gt; then went and got a book on ships.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess I am just looking for some feedback from other moms in the<br/>\n&gt; same boat, clarification of the day to day of unschooling, and any<br/>\n&gt; other advice and web sites you think could help me and my son!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you - Dawn<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carol Gilliam","from":"&quot;Carol Gilliam&quot; &lt;jeannie@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"jYm4mzO9jpAQqXO_A3-E8MXchWbjUa5Too4tW2e7pld4DUvTGL_sWMBVS0wcerXNRLNfdgMnPNky-vDPf0R6bKKHKrZ3BYfRW3DPUg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fear of unschooling","postDate":"979000166","msgId":14942,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTA5MDAyOS5UQUEyOTc0MEBib25lcy53bmNsaW5rLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14940,"nextInTopic":14956,"prevInTime":14941,"nextInTime":14943,"topicId":14922,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Off topic kind of- I believe there is a  more detaild Pokemon handbook.

I carefully explained it to them and<br/>\nincorporated the portfolio review system as our assessment and I can share the portfolio with them<br/>\nif they would like to see it. (none have been that interested so far in sitting down to review the<br/>\nportfolio) I have kept a portfolio anyway each year since there birth even when they were in PS.<br/>\nWhen questioned further I have offered them books about Piagets Developmental Theory (which<br/>\nbasically say&#39;s that when they are developmentally ready to do something they will)and evidence of<br/>\nmy chilrens progress. (I use Childrens skills Test from virtual knowledge as well as the<br/>\nportfolio)<br/>\nAnother unschooling theory is Brain Based Learning You can take a course on that at<br/>\nwww.free-ed.com also. So many educational Theories lend themselve more to unschooling more than<br/>\ntraditional schooling that it is no wonder learning slows as children progress in PS. But it is<br/>\nmopre important to prove it to yourself by finding many sources of evidence then you can defend it<br/>\nto others.<br/>\nMy mother is self taught She has a 8th grade education but runs her own business. <br/>\nMy father in law Graduated highschool only with no further education he wrote the .08 alcohol law<br/>\nthat Maine has. He is first to admit that his hischool diploma had nothing to do with his success.<br/>\nI got MY First classical Music interest from Bugs Bunny and Road runner.<br/>\nI learned about Language arts Multiplication and US History from School House Rock not from the<br/>\npublic school system where I was teased for being different and not complying with the so called<br/>\nsocial system rules. (I loved to read and draw and cared about others feelings) I learned at home<br/>\nbut my drunk parents used the PS for cheap daycare.<br/>\nDorinda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
