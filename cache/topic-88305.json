Mom or dad says, &quot;GO to your room and while you&#39;re there <br/>\nthink about being obedient and doing what I tell you the FIRST time I <br/>\nsay it. And no playing in there.&quot; There are people with rules about <br/>\nwhat &quot;crimes&quot; will result in how many minutes in the kid&#39;s room. I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard people suggest one minute for each year old the child is.  What <br/>\ndo you think the kids REALLY think about while they are in there - <br/>\nwaiting to be released?<br/>\n<br/>\nProtecting other people from a kid who is being destructive or <br/>\npurposely causing a problem - a kid who is overtired and overstimulated <br/>\nand being super loud and disruptive and pestering, for example - is <br/>\nsomething we have to do. Ideally, of COURSE, we&#39;d do it sweetly and <br/>\nbrilliantly - figure out that a soothing bubble bath is just what the <br/>\nchild needs - or a bowl of hot soup or a backrub or whatever -- but in <br/>\nreal life there are times we just say, as you described, Krisula, &quot;Be <br/>\nmore quiet or go in the other room.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a kid who is overstimulated - being too rough - being rude or mean <br/>\nto the rest of the family - asking them to &quot;Go in the other room and <br/>\nget yourself calmed down before you come back,&quot; is not a punishment - <br/>\nit is an attempt by the parent to protect other family members and let <br/>\nthe child know that he/she is being rude and an opportunity for the <br/>\nchild to get in control of him/herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know - it isn&#39;t the pinnacle of great parental creativity either - <br/>\nbut it is real life - especially when you have 3 young kids and a busy <br/>\nlife -- there are times that telling them to go in the other room is <br/>\nthe best we can come up with under pressure. Its a whole lot better <br/>\nthan yelling, swatting, telling them that &quot;just for that you get no <br/>\ndessert tonight,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll tell your father and he&#39;ll get his belt out&quot; <br/>\nand so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154422553,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"&quot;Krisula Moyer&quot; &lt;krisulam@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4366","postDate":"1073698842","msgId":88305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PElORU5MQU5QUENKSEFJUE9NRklPS0VGQUNDQUEua3Jpc3VsYW1AdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNzM2ODY1NDEuMjU1NS44NDg2Mi5tOUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":88346,"prevInTime":88304,"nextInTime":88306,"topicId":88305,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In our house I do this<br/>\nbecause someone is &quot;bothering&quot; people purposely?  For Exampe;  8yo Sydney<br/>\nteases 10yo Trayton (and sometimes 3yo Anika) mercilessly. Sometimes it is<br/>\nonly teasing, which will abate with just a reminder but sometimes it is more<br/>\npersistent and she seems willing to go to great lengths to make others<br/>\nunhappy.  I have taken to telling her that I just don&#39;t want to be around<br/>\nteasing (or yelling or whatever) and would she please go somewhere else.  I<br/>\nhave occasionally offered to go away myself but this is often quite<br/>\ninconvenient to me or the offended sibling.  And she may just follow that<br/>\nperson to the new location.  I&#39;m not sure this is as much a choice for her<br/>\nas a command.  For example, I don&#39;t say &quot;gee, Syd, would you be happier<br/>\ndoing that in your room?&quot;  It&#39;s more like &quot;Hey! You guys are way too loud<br/>\nyou may talk more nicely to your brother or you may go to your room.&quot; If I&#39;m<br/>\nfeeling especially patient I may help her explore other things she could be<br/>\ndoing but for the most part It is basically me sending her to her room. Of<br/>\ncourse there is the council of the wise one (me) if they truly are having a<br/>\nproblem that they are having a hard time solving but usually it&#39;s just a<br/>\nvery loud pastime.<br/>\n  krisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88344,"nextTopicId":88243}}
