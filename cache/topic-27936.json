You<br/>\ncould be 25 yards away when your child suddenly drops to the ground and by<br/>\nthe time you get to the child it might be too late.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realise that Category 3s are, thankfully, relatively rare but they are a<br/>\nfact of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only positive about the allergy and living in the US is that companies<br/>\nmust now clearly label their products if there is any chance peanuts might<br/>\nbe in the product OR if they use the same equipment to make something with<br/>\npeanuts.

They<br/>\nhave been exported to all countries and now play a part in the cooking of<br/>\nalmost every ethnic group.
