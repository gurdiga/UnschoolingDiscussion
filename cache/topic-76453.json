My son Jimmy was in Early Intervention <br/>\npreschool from ages 3-5, and it was not a good fit.  By the end of the second year, <br/>\nI knew we were going to homeschool.  In PA you don&#39;t have to do anything <br/>\nofficial until age 8, and since he was only 5, I felt I had plenty of time to get <br/>\nmy ducks in a row.  I worked in preschool for 15 years, and was practically <br/>\nrubbing my hands together in excitement at the prospect of &quot;teaching him at <br/>\nhome&quot;.<br/>\n  I went out and bought &quot;The Carolina Curriculum for Special Needs <br/>\nPreschoolers&quot;.  I was in checklist heaven.  Here was EVERYTHING a kid &quot;needs to know&quot;, <br/>\nfrom catching a ball to making a sandwich.  So I made lots of lists.<br/>\n  The next thing I did was read everything I could find about homeschooling.  <br/>\nAnd I joined lots of yahoo groups.  PA has some crazy hs laws, so if a group <br/>\nwas about PA homeschoolers, I joined.  One was called PA Unschoolers.  That <br/>\nwas the first time I heard that term.  I was intrigued by the whole idea, so I <br/>\njoined Unschooling Dotcom.<br/>\n  In the meantime, I learned a few things.  One, I could toss a ball forever, <br/>\nbut I can&#39;t make him catch it if he didn&#39;t want to.  Two, while I was busy <br/>\nwith my lists, Jim had learned most of his letters and numbers by fooling around <br/>\nwith his computer games.  And from being  with people all day who talk to him <br/>\nand listen to him, his speech has improved dramatically.  <br/>\n  So, by the time I learned about unschooling, I already had proof that it <br/>\nworked.  That a child could learn without being &quot;taught&quot;.  And just because <br/>\nwe&#39;re unschooling by default, it doesn&#39;t make it faulty or inferior.  <br/>\nMary J<br/>\nPS  One day, instead of running away, he stayed put and caught the ball.  <br/>\nThen he laughed, dropped it, and ran away.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76373,"nextTopicId":76456}}
