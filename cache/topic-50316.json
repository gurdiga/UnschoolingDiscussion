That&#39;s<br/>\nassumed, or we&#39;d get so much mail every day, nobody would read this list!  I<br/>\nread your statement the same way that Sandra did; maybe this one needed more<br/>\nfleshing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people here, me included, have learned a great deal from this list.<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s been annoying to learn some of those things.  But no one is<br/>\ntelling you that you MUST do your unschooling this way.  There are things<br/>\ndiscussed here that I don&#39;t do.  Yet.  Maybe never.  Maybe next week.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I can compare this to becomming a vegetarian, which is on my mind<br/>\nbecause I was just reading a veggie magazine.  Many people start their<br/>\njourney by eating less meat and more vegetarian meals.  Eventually they<br/>\nmight go totally vegetarian, and later vegan.  Or not.  They might stop at<br/>\nvegetarian, or they might benefit from just eating less meat and listening<br/>\nin on the vegetarians politely.  I think many folks here are<br/>\nvegan-unschoolers.  It&#39;s ok if you&#39;re still eating meat.  But you&#39;ll likely<br/>\nhear suggestions that you take the plunge and stop eating it!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut nobody&#39;s gonna show up to your house and thow out your &quot;meat&quot;, if that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re worried about!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50314,"nextTopicId":50225}}
