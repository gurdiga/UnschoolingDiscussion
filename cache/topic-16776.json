He would everyday subtract how much he had<br/>\nmade so far and try to figure out how much he had<br/>\nleft, then ask me how many more dayz it would take. He<br/>\nsaved it up and bought what he wanted and he hardly<br/>\never plays with it but it is special cuz he did it<br/>\nhimself. Now when him or his sister gets some pocket<br/>\nchange from me he advises her &quot;save it, Aspen, cuz<br/>\nthen tomorrow you could get two more quarters and then<br/>\ntwo more and two more and you can save it up to buy<br/>\nsomething you want.&quot; It&#39;s cute. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Horses before carts.

I solved that by not requiring any math workbooks<br/>\nat all. What we have been doing is learning math (shhh, don&#39;t tell) by<br/>\nplaying games. Yahtzee works wonderfully for addition and multiplication<br/>\nskills, Uno and racko are also good. There is a website that was showing<br/>\nbingo math that you could download into the computer, but I think we are<br/>\ngoing to make our own. IT is so easy...make a template for a bingo card<br/>\non your write program whatever that is and then print that template out.<br/>\nin the squares, put numbers that will correspond with what the announcer<br/>\nsays. Example=N 6x6 so would be answer 36 in the square. You can make<br/>\nthese up out of poster board, construction papers, etc and use beans,<br/>\nbeads, pennies, etc to put over the squares. It can be a project that<br/>\nboth parent and child create and its fun. You can do addition bingo,<br/>\nsubtraction, bingo, multiplication bingo, division bingo, etc. You can<br/>\nalso teach fractions by cooking...using cooking skills for fractions<br/>\nhelps the child learn actual math and have fun at the same time! (and it<br/>\nalso has practical applications). Another suggestion is to use Monopoly<br/>\nor life or other games that also promote math skills. One I like is Math<br/>\nGames and Activities from around the world (The Sycamore Tree 14.95),<br/>\nAmazing Math with your kids (sycamore tree 14.95) and Money Dominoes (the<br/>\nsycamore tree 10.25). I have not used these last three, but I am planning<br/>\non buying them. Some kids just simply hate worksheets and repition...and<br/>\nthis is one way to help them enjoy math without feeling like they are<br/>\nbeing bogged down.<br/>\nJessica<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, 07 Mar 2001 10:19:25 -0600 Sherry Hagen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oilmagic@...\">oilmagic@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi folks,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a friend who both homeschools and unschools.
