You make <br/>\nan actual list, like they have in restaurants when you&#39;re waiting for a <br/>\ntable. Put down the child&#39;s name as the next one to use the computer or pick <br/>\nthe TV program. There&#39;s a lot of power in knowing you are &quot;next.&quot;  I would <br/>\nalso try to distract or play ar pay attention to the one who&#39;s really having <br/>\na hard time waiting. Make that time fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour little 3 year old will probably need you to be his advocate if there <br/>\nare really shows he wants to watch. Or even if he just feels like he never <br/>\ngets to pick and just wants a turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike you said, the first month or 3 of satellite is a BIG deal. The novelty <br/>\nwill wear off. It did in our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>\nearth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                      ~ Thich Nhat Hanh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62112,"nextTopicId":62137}}
