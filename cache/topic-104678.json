Mackenzie (ds) wanted to know which notes were which and putting stickers on the keys was the easiest/quickest way for him to see that. I only had some colored star stickers and some animal stickers, so some of our keys became &quot;gorilla&quot; and &quot;cheetah&quot;. Which is funny, because even when he plays on another piano without the stickers and he is reading music, I can hear him saying under his breath &quot;red, blue, gorilla, gorilla&quot;, LOL. So for him it was a help. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter ignores the stickers and plays by ear. She has been taking Suzuki violin for 2 years, and one thing I really like about that program is that they do not push reading music at all. She has really developed the ability to play by ear and can pick out anything she wants on the piano. My son doesn&#39;t really have the same ear ability that she has and was getting frustrated trying to pick out songs or even having me play bits so he could learn them from me. For him, the logical-brained guy, the stickers as visual cues worked so much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo really, it all boils down to what would work best for your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it would be educational for all of us (as neither parent plays), but<br/>\n&gt; part of me wanted to allow the kiddos to experiment and fiddle around<br/>\n&gt; on their own w/o the keys being labeled.  Below I&#39;ve pasted a quote by<br/>\n&gt; John Holt on the topic of children learning to play music. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love that quote (and indeed his book is really interesting). Our experience here is that the key labels didn&#39;t prevent any experimenting or fiddling around. Mackenzie tends to learn a song and then fiddle with the parts of it. He learned Greensleeves for instance, then he will do things like play it with the bass hand playing the first note, then the right hand playing the second note but an octave higher, then going back to the bass hand for the 3rd note. Or he&#39;ll play with adding chords, or he has even composed some music and written it down for me to play. And like I said, Asa ignores the stickers completely and plays, fiddles, composes, noodles, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\nRadmama to Asa (5) and Mackenzie (8)<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are God; Pay attention. - Viggo Mortensen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194903596,"authorName":"Ruth","from":"&quot;Ruth&quot; &lt;grayfamily9@...&gt;","profile":"ladybird579","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Holt Quote on learning to play music","postDate":"1111313723","msgId":104679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWM1MmQzNSRiYWNkNGFlMCQ5Yjk2NjQ1M0BwY2FiYTFkMzU1NTE5Zj4=","referencesHeader":"PGQxaWdmYys1OTltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104678,"nextInTopic":104682,"prevInTime":104678,"nextInTime":104680,"topicId":104678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Jennifer It is not a piano but my youngest learnt to play a glockenspiel without labelling the keys.

He is only 6 and enjoyed messing around to get the tunes he wanted out of it.  As an experiment I gave him sheet music ( that came with it)  with coded notes that corresponded to the coloured keys on the instrument but he ignored them so I took them away. So  would say let them get on with it and ses how it goes.  If frustration sets in you could ask them if they would like the labels on then.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuth<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThis email and all attachments have been electronically scanned by Kingston<br/>\nCommunications&#39; email Anti-Virus service and no known viruses were detected.<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86181566,"authorName":"jenneferh2000","from":"&quot;jenneferh2000&quot; &lt;jenneferh2000@...&gt;","profile":"jenneferh2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Holt Quote on learning to play music","postDate":"1111278892","msgId":104678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQxaWdmYys1OTltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104679,"prevInTime":104677,"nextInTime":104679,"topicId":104678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been enjoying the thread on children learning to play the piano and am finding it very informative.

I bought our two small boys a toy<br/>\n Grand Piano manufactured by First Act, and it came with stickers for<br/>\nthe keys.  I haven&#39;t yet put them on and wonder if I should?  I guess<br/>\nit would be educational for all of us (as neither parent plays), but<br/>\npart of me wanted to allow the kiddos to experiment and fiddle around<br/>\non their own w/o the keys being labeled.  Below I&#39;ve pasted a quote by<br/>\nJohn Holt on the topic of children learning to play music.  Thought<br/>\nsome might be interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennefer in Oregon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt, How Children Learn (1983)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have since come to feel very strongly, partly from my experience in<br/>\nmusic and my own work on the cello (about which I wrote in Never Too<br/>\nLate), partly from the little I know of music history, that<br/>\nimprovisation lies at the very heart of all music making and should be<br/>\na central part of every kind of music instruction.  Much of my own<br/>\ntime on the cello I spend improvising in different ways, and if I were<br/>\nteaching cello or any kind of instrument to children or adults, I<br/>\nwould urge them to spend some of their time doing the same: either<br/>\ntrying to play by ear tunes they know, or thinking up tunes in their<br/>\nmind and trying to play them, or simply moving their hands around the<br/>\nfingerboards or keyboards, with no conscious plan, just hearing<br/>\nwhatever notes come out. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, there can be varying amounts of conscious control in<br/>\nimprovising.  At one extreme, we try to make our muscles play the<br/>\ntunes, other people&#39;s or our own, that we hear in our minds.  At the<br/>\nother, we let our hands move on their own, and listen to and think<br/>\nabout what they bring to us.  It is when our muscles, hands, and<br/>\nfingers can improvise with the least conscious control that we are<br/>\nmost truly improvising and have the most natural and effortless<br/>\ncontrol of our instruments.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle children do this when they are singing their charming endless<br/>\nmade-up songs.  They are not first hearing a tune in their minds and<br/>\nthen trying to sing it.  They are simply singing, and letting whatever<br/>\ncomes out, come out.  We ought to encourage them in this, and do more<br/>\nof it ourselves.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104746,"nextTopicId":104777}}
