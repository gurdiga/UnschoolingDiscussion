I hadn&#39;t gotten the first line <br/>\ndone when he said, &quot;Here mom, let me try.&quot;  So I handed it to him.  2 HOURS <br/>\nLATER......he handed it back to me :o).  He went through his entire book of <br/>\nmusic.  &quot;Mom, it&#39;s so fun!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n He&#39;s 15 now, and was about 9 or 10 when he took lessons.  I think with some <br/>\nkids maturity will spark interest too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time I got my fiddle out, and the accordian to work on 4H music, and <br/>\nnext thing I knew, the oldest foster son pulled down his guitar, Michael found <br/>\nhis harmonica, another pulled out his recorder, another found a different <br/>\nguitar and a tin whistle.  Even my husband pulled out his Dobro (which he hasn&#39;t <br/>\ntouched in about a year) and started picking at it.  Music is so catching and <br/>\nI personally love the sound of music being tried!<br/>\n<br/>\nI took lessons as a kid, hated it, but when I learned that the &quot;old <br/>\nfashioned&quot; way that  common folks often learned music, passing it from one person to <br/>\nanother, I caught on very quickly to the fiddle.  I just always hated reading <br/>\nmusic.

My 11 year old son has been playing the violin for over a year now. Fortunately for him he is big enough to have a full-sized violin. Also fortunately","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-37826525\">Hi!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 year old son has been playing the violin for over a year now.  <br/>\nFortunately for him he is big enough to have a full-sized violin.  <br/>\nAlso fortunately (even though we are renting right now--he wants a <br/>\ncello and guitar and bass guitar), the rental on the violin is $25 <br/>\nper month.  You can actually purchase a used violin for around $300 <br/>\nand save yourself the rental interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter really wants a violin, I say by all means get her a <br/>\nviolin.  Even if you rent one for a month just to see how she really <br/>\nreacts to it and interacts with it, it is well worth the money.  You <br/>\ncan also purchase the Suzuki program which will have her playing that <br/>\nviolin befor your month is up (check Amazon for Suzuki).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as a toy is concerned, don&#39;t do it.  My other son (their <br/>\ntwins) wanted a saxophone (alto) since he was at least 3 years old.  <br/>\nFirst thing we did was go and buy that silly toy.  He hated it, <br/>\ncompletely and totally.  He continued to ask for a sax-o-phone until <br/>\nhe was able to pronounce it properly.  For his 11th birthday we <br/>\nrented a Bundy Alto Sax.  He just looked at it for two months and <br/>\ninsisted we pay for lessons.  We did, but could only afford about <br/>\nfive weeks worth of lessons right off.  It really paid off, he had an <br/>\nexcellent teacher and we are six months out--he&#39;s playing in our <br/>\nchurch&#39;s orchestra.  I have decided to re-employ that music teacher, <br/>\nin addition to their other lessons (through the orchestra and our <br/>\npublic Baltimore School for the Arts which is free).  The orchestra <br/>\nmembers have given him many accessories and expensive books and have <br/>\ntaught him lessons that will last a lifetime as they are mostly men <br/>\nover the age of 40ish.  He has played in a wedding and at many other <br/>\nchurches.  We are soo proud of him we don&#39;t know what to do.  Since <br/>\nthe age of three he was convicted in his desire to be a saxophonist.  <br/>\nThe members of his orchestra have invited his twin brother to join <br/>\nwith his violin.  He will attend his first practice this Thursday.  <br/>\nThe violinist will be the only strings player in the all brass <br/>\norchestra.  The orchestra plans to make its first CD in February and <br/>\nI am overjoyed at their success.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if your daughter wants a violin---get it immediately.  Just <br/>\nsupervise her care and use of the violin until she is able to take <br/>\ncare of it herself.  You will know once she has that cute little <br/>\nviolin in her possession whether she really wants to play it <br/>\nseriously or just for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW:  Playing an instrument helps tremendously with our school work <br/>\n(critical thinking skills) and discipline issues.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, MarSi77@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hi~<br/>\n&gt;   My daughter ( age 5) is passionate about the violin.

I own two relatively inexpensive uke&#39;s.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re good for learning.  I do have to face prejudice from some music snobs who <br/>\nsnort over them being ukulele&#39;s in the first place.  lol.  A 5 yo friend of mine <br/>\neven said, &quot;My daddy said your ukulele is a TOY!&quot;  His daddy owns an <br/>\nexpensive guitar, but never plays it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy ukulele is not a toy.  It is a musical instrument.  It&#39;s not expensive and <br/>\nnot particularly finely made.  But it sounds good to me and I&#39;m learning a <br/>\nlot and I didn&#39;t have to spend hundreds and then feel guilty over the expense <br/>\nwhen I don&#39;t play for a week or two.  It didn&#39;t cost too much to find out that I <br/>\nreally like playing ukulele and I&#39;m good enough at it to have a good time and <br/>\nmeet my own goals.  Moreover, now that I can actually play ukulele, I know <br/>\nexactly what to look for when I want a new one, if I do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEventually I will buy another instrument.  The best advice I&#39;ve heard is to <br/>\nvisit lots of music stores and try their instruments.  The instrument you keep <br/>\ncoming back to should be the one you buy.  It helps if you already know a <br/>\nlittle about how to play, I suppose.  Unfortunately, since I don&#39;t live in Hawaii, <br/>\nthere are never any ukulele&#39;s in the stores that aren&#39;t the cheap China-made <br/>\nvariety.  And they&#39;ll have one of those IF I&#39;m lucky.  So what am I supposed <br/>\nto do?  Just NOT take up ukulele until I could afford/put my hands on only the <br/>\nbest one?  Time&#39;s a wastin&#39;, I say.  I took advantage of what was available <br/>\nand now...I&#39;m a ukulele player.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI say get your daughter a violin in her size, even if you have to rent it.  <br/>\nPeople have instruments lying around in their closets that aren&#39;t being used.  <br/>\nAsk around.  I don&#39;t know about violins, but even if it&#39;s a relatively cheap <br/>\none, you can gauge her interest and aptitude and see if it&#39;s something that&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to stick for her.

So I bought one and signed him up for Suzuki, in which the mom and <br/>\nchild supposedly learn together. Well, the first assignment was to build a <br/>\ntoy violin, from a box covered in brown shopping-bag paper and strings drawn on <br/>\nwith red magic marker. One end had a paint paddle attached to be the &quot;neck.<br/>\n<br/>\n       No sound to worry about sounding bad at least! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       The idea was that little children really need to be able to make <br/>\nmistakes, to be rough, to fumble and drop it, whatever. The first task is to <br/>\ningrain the standing still, the standing straight, the tucking under the chin at the <br/>\nright spot, the lifting and lowering and repositioning, et cetera, ad <br/>\nnauseum. Not making actual sound.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I don&#39;t mean to misrepresent the method or diss violin playing -- it <br/>\ndid not work for us, obviously, probably for were many reasons other than this <br/>\nand that wouldn&#39;t apply to your situation anyway. My only real point is that <br/>\nwhen this method DOES work, it all starts by building and handling your own toy <br/>\nviolin and then not playing at all. If you can get anything helpful out of <br/>\nthis, more power to you! &lt;gg&gt;  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58132404,"authorName":"MarSi77@aol.com","from":"MarSi77@...","profile":"m6hschch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"violin question","postDate":"1070203401","msgId":85590,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2YS4yNzIwYmU5Yy4yY2ZiNWMwOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":85592,"prevInTime":85589,"nextInTime":85591,"topicId":85590,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi~ My daughter ( age 5) is passionate about the violin.
