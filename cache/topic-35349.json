I was saying that <br/>\nunschoolers generally don&#39;t think about learning in terms of school-subjects. <br/>\nIf we&#39;re interested in bunsen burners we&#39;d sign up to do something that uses <br/>\nbunsen burners, of course. And if we&#39;re interested in poetry, we might sign <br/>\nup for a poetry-writing workshop. If we wanted to know the formula for salt, <br/>\nwe&#39;d look that up under chemistry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschoolers don&#39;t divide our children&#39;s learning (or our own) into <br/>\n&quot;English,&quot; &quot;Science,&quot; &quot;History,&quot; and &quot;Math.&quot; Some people do, when they are <br/>\nnew to unschooling or if they can&#39;t really accept it that the subjects are <br/>\narbitrary and unreal and only done that way for the convenience of schools. <br/>\nThey look at what the kid is doing and they comfort themselves or reassure <br/>\nthemselves - &quot;That is math and THAT is English and THAT is history.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point was that people tend to stop even THINKING in those terms as they <br/>\nunschool longer. The kids just learn. Those who keep thinking in those terms <br/>\nwill often try to make sure the kids focus on the subject the parent thinks <br/>\nthey are supposed to be learning when engaged in some activity. So they&#39;ll be <br/>\nat a science museum looking at an exhibit on buildings and the parent will be <br/>\nthinking this is &quot;science&quot; and keep turning the kids&#39; attention to the <br/>\ndifferent kinds of structures - to the engineering - how the buildings are <br/>\nbuilt. The KID may be more interested in imagining what it is like to live in <br/>\nthe different kinds of homes that are on display, and not at all interested <br/>\nin the mechanics of how they are built.<br/>\n<br/>\nDividing learning into subjects is for school. Dividing books into categories <br/>\nis for librarians to make it easier for us to find them. And, I&#39;m sure nobody <br/>\nwill be surprised to find out that those categories are NOT cut and dried and <br/>\nthat there is often great debate among the catalogers about where to put any <br/>\nparticular book.

I&#39;m one of those people. I ALWAYS <br/>\nappreciate blunt talk - I do not get offended when I know someone is being <br/>\nhonest. I am, instead, offended by dissimulation - by pretense - by someone <br/>\nacting supportive of just anything, whether they really think it is a good <br/>\nidea or not. I&#39;m offended by people who don&#39;t say what they think, because <br/>\nthey waste my time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people need to hear things in an undiluted form. Sometimes people don&#39;t <br/>\nlike what they hear and they leave in a huff and then come back later to say <br/>\nthat they continued to ponder what was said and that it LATER affected them <br/>\nprofoundly. It is a big list and it is EASY to just delete posts from someone <br/>\nif you don&#39;t want to read them. It is much better for the list, to do that, <br/>\nthen to critique another person&#39;s personality, approach, posting style, <br/>\nintentions, etc. If people want to respond, they should respond directly to <br/>\nthe ideas in the post.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes someone says something about &quot;doing lessons&quot; and someone says, <br/>\n&quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling.&quot; And the first person has an &quot;aha&quot; experience - and <br/>\nsuddenly has a breakthrough in their understanding about what unschooling is <br/>\nREALLY like. Sometimes people just get offended and feel like the person has <br/>\nnitpicked and is playing semantics games - but that is likely because they <br/>\ndon&#39;t really understand the implications.<br/>\n<br/>\nA possible response to such posts might be: &quot;Woops - you&#39;re right -- &quot;doing <br/>\nlessons&quot; in the usual schoolish sense isn&#39;t what I really meant. Or - &quot;You&#39;re <br/>\nright - &quot;doing lessons&quot; isn&#39;t really unschooling, I guess we&#39;re not really <br/>\nunschooling.&quot; That would be perfectly understandable - not everybody here is <br/>\nunschooling - they&#39;re just here to learn about it and maybe take some ideas <br/>\nfrom unschoolers as they see fit. That is okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of people who are offended by the idea of unschooling and <br/>\noffended by having it pointed out that what they are talking about isn&#39;t <br/>\nreally unschooling. I can understand that. It can be threatening to people to <br/>\nhear, bluntly and directly, that what they spent their whole lives believing <br/>\nwas necessary, what they went through themselves and often put their children <br/>\nthrough, was not only not necessary but possibly harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone doesn&#39;t believe it - then they don&#39;t and that&#39;s fine. They can do <br/>\nthings their way - obviously. But on an unschooling list where the purpose is <br/>\nto support unschooling, you can&#39;t expect that support to be in the form of <br/>\npretending to think &quot;doing lessons&quot; and teaching that is subject-based and <br/>\nanything else any homeschooling parent might do - is all the same as <br/>\nunschooling. It isn&#39;t unschooling, even the concept of &quot;subjects&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>\nunschooling and people will point that out and talk about why it isn&#39;t and <br/>\nwhy they don&#39;t do those things and don&#39;t believe in dividing learning into <br/>\nsubjects, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people will come to the list who don&#39;t like what they hear. If I went <br/>\nto a Charlotte Mason list or a Calvert Curriculum list or any other <br/>\nhomeschooling &quot;style&quot; list, I wouldn&#39;t like what I heard there either. I <br/>\nspent time on an Oak Meadow Curriculum list - because there were some things <br/>\nI wanted learn about their curriculum. But I wouldn&#39;t get pissed off if I was <br/>\non a Calvert list and I said that I was letting my kids &quot;just learn from <br/>\nlife&quot; and people on that list jumped on that phrase and explained how they <br/>\nthought that was a terrible idea and that it wouldn&#39;t work and that I should, <br/>\ninstead, use a structured, carefully preplanned, curriculum. It is what the <br/>\nlist would be for, for supporting THAT approach, and I should not post there <br/>\nif I don&#39;t want to HEAR that.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"There&#39;s *got* to be a way to make this work","postDate":"1019412250","msgId":35484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4RTg3NzVBLjc5MTklZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2LjI2M2UyZjBlLjI5ZjQ0YTBhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35473,"nextInTopic":35511,"prevInTime":35483,"nextInTime":35485,"topicId":35349,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So how can we make it work so *both* these types of needs (down below) are met?

It is a<br/>\nfrustrating<br/>\nthing.]<br/>\nSharon,I know what you mean.  I had 4 chemistry classes in high school,<br/>\nand while I understood how the little molecules are made by the atoms and<br/>\nall that, I never could see how to apply it in my life.  I still can&#39;t<br/>\nfigure out how people can understand to make chemicals and such by mixing<br/>\nmolecules up, or how they can figure out what things are made of by<br/>\nbreaking them down.  I never really understood it, it was some sort of<br/>\nabstract thing.  I always did well in math, sort of, but I really didn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand Algebra I.  Fortunately, I had taken enough Pre-Algebra to get<br/>\nsome of it, enough to get a C.  Algebra II, though, was good because I<br/>\nhad a great teacher who made sure we all understood it.  But it isn&#39;t<br/>\nanything I remember now, because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to use it in<br/>\nmy life.  The only math I really loved was Geometry.  I always felt like<br/>\npeople who understood higher math and science were somehow more<br/>\nintelligent than I.  I thought I was somehow inferior to them.  All I<br/>\nremember about Trigonometry was &quot;a&quot; squared plus &quot;b&quot; squared equals &quot;c&quot;<br/>\nsquared.  I remember that because it was something I could understand,<br/>\nhow to find the length of the &quot;slanty-side&quot; of a right triangle, like a<br/>\nsecret solving a puzzle or a riddle(I don&#39;t know if it applied to other<br/>\ntypes of triangles,ouch, my brain just cramped).  I was much more into<br/>\nBiology and Physiology, because these were things I could actually see<br/>\nand measure with my eyes.  I remember a boy in Trig who would say, &quot;What<br/>\ndoes this have to do with anything in my life?&quot;  <br/>\nBonni<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"gruvystarchild","from":"&quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: math experiences","postDate":"1019347196","msgId":35378,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE5c3Zkcyt2aTVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMjcwMWMxZThiOSQ1MDU2MjA2MCQyZjgxMWMwY0BzdWdhcmNyYWZ0ZXI+"},"prevInTopic":35366,"nextInTopic":35390,"prevInTime":35377,"nextInTime":35379,"topicId":35349,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
