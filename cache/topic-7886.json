LOL By the way, my first child flat out refused to nurse<br/>\nfrom my left breast so feeling terribly wicked I simply fed her from the<br/>\nright one all the time!! I didn&#39;t dare tell anyone but hey, it worked! She<br/>\nnursed until about a year and thrived.<br/>\nRecently a friend had the same issue with her 11 month old boy refusing one<br/>\nbreast and she too merely began feeding him solely from the other - no harm<br/>\ndone! Just a thought for next time maybe? (((hugs)))<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nBrooke</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7883,"nextTopicId":7880}}
