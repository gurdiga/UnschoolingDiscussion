I mean, there are <br/>\npeople EVERYWHERE. My kids, though, are natural born social <br/>\nbutterflies.  All our neighbors, young and old, know us because they <br/>\nknow our kids. Even when they are sick as dogs they will find the <br/>\nenergy to scream --PLAYGROUND! And these kids are little (5, 2.5). <br/>\nSometimes my husband and I just look at them like their aliens from <br/>\nMars. Anyhow, we have to have a balance. There are days when all I <br/>\nwant to do is hangout and all the kids want is to go go go. Then we <br/>\ngo and in just a three block radius there are hundreds of little <br/>\nhappenings going on in our slice of the East Village. So &quot;isolation&quot; <br/>\nis more of a practice for us but never a goal.
