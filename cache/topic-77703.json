Some are ready to make changes in their lives, whatever has happened in their lives has put them in a place where they&#39;re ready to learn the things that bring about happy unschooling.<br/>\nIt is not the job of anyone here to GET people ready to accept the &quot;lesson&quot; of unschooling/gentle parenting. Only an individual, in their own unique way and time can get to the place where they&#39;re ready.<br/>\nThis list isn&#39;t here to get them ready.<br/>\nIt&#39;s here to help those that ARE ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone comes here and is in a place in their lives and learning where they aren&#39;t ready, there isn&#39;t ONE thing anyone here can say that will help. NO matter how kindly, how wonderfully phrased or how much Non-violent communication the list members use, it is NOT going to sink in.<br/>\nSo I don&#39;t think that the majority of folks that come here for information are going to get help if we water the information down for those that aren&#39;t going to &quot;get it&quot; at this point anyway!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOom/Chris may have more experiences in life and learn more and someday really be ready to learn about unschooling. Great! But she obviously is NOT ready right now. I wasn&#39;t at certain times in my life either. All of us have our own journey and these things often can&#39;t be rushed (which is unfortunate for any children that are being treated less respectfully) but the list isn&#39;t going to help the highest percentage of people unless it DOES focus on getting information to those that really want it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77631,"nextTopicId":77689}}
