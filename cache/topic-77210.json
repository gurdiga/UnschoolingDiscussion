I am relatively new to the ideas of unschooling but have been trying to practice for half a year now and am enjoying. My question today is about my almost 11 yr olds interest in modeling. She gets people telling her that she shoudl be a model all the time becuase she is so tall (5&#39;2&quot;) and she is very pretty. However, I am so scared of the idea of somebody telling her that she is not pretty or she needs to lose weight, ect. I also know NOTHING about this industry aside from what I read in articles and stuff like that. So after much discussion my dh and I decided that this is something that she clearly has expressed interest in and we should support her. I don&#39;t even know where to begin finding a modeling class (do they offer classes or is it all pageants?) I don&#39;t know anything about this and to make matters worse whenever I search on google it comes up with pornography! and then, I feel even worse, like what am I getting my little dd in to? I want to support her in<br/>\n whatever interests her so I am OPEN to any ideas... anyone been there with experience here?
