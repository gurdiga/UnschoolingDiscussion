When I first started h/s I found that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most of the books in the local library where targeted at the younger<br/>\n&gt; &gt; child - my dd was 11yrs old when we started h/s  (moving on to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschool.)  I would have loved a book telling ME about deschooling,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what to expect, how to motivate, what to do. I couldnt realate to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other books. Even now I wish I had a book that I could read and re-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; read, some thing that would boost moral.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I did read *out of Eygpt (I think thats the name) it was a lovely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; book - but it was about above average children - my dd is not above<br/>\n&gt; &gt; average<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some one else suggested you publish it yourself.  I would imagine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this could be costly - but if you have the money, well worth looking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Good Luck<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Marianne<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                    Yahoo!
