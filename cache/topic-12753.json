I think KIPP is an <br/>\n&gt; idea he&#39;s considering for ps.  You have to admit there&#39;s a lot of <br/>\n&gt; room for improvement in ps for those who can not or do not wish to <br/>\n&gt; homeschool.  In fact in Tampa, FL area his campaign has a homeschool <br/>\n&gt; mom who acts as a coordinator contact for homeschool.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12750,"nextTopicId":12756}}
