Going <br/>\n&gt;through too much physical turmoil to get embroiled on the stuff on the list <br/>\n&gt;too. But Helen&#39;s message struck me. I didn&#39;t appreciate her method but I <br/>\n&gt;understood her madness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The plain fact is that we seem to have cycles on this list. The good, the <br/>\n&gt;bad and oh yes, the ugly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We have moments when we shine. When we all come together to help one <br/>\n&gt;another question and answer our collective approaches to schooling, <br/>\n&gt;unschooling and parenting in general. These are the moments when we -each <br/>\n&gt;of us- contribute just a little something, a little bit of our own flavor <br/>\n&gt;and when taken in create a masterpiece.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Then we have moments when we get a little thoughtless or insensitive. <br/>\n&gt;Perhaps too sensitive is what I should say. Moments when for just a New <br/>\n&gt;York minute we let the bad in and become JUDGEMENTAL.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s okay. This list is full of moms, dads, teachers, leaders and since <br/>\n&gt;we&#39;re all human on this list, the occasional screw-ups. But we acknowledge, <br/>\n&gt;apologize and move on. And thank goodness for the occasional screw up. They <br/>\n&gt;remind us to think before we speak, to consider and reconsider the way we <br/>\n&gt;treat or mistreat others, such consideration is probably a big asset for a <br/>\n&gt;group of folks attempting to guide their young-ins and deschool themselves <br/>\n&gt;at the same time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The problem is when the Ugly sneaks it&#39;s ugly face in. Ahh, the moments <br/>\n&gt;when we tear down instead of buildup. Then we go back in and do it again. <br/>\n&gt;The long, long debates on whether so and so said what they said they said <br/>\n&gt;and so forth. Usually followed by people upset about all the people saying <br/>\n&gt;what was or was not said and then the comments about how people should go <br/>\n&gt;and say things somewhere else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is not new for us. But it is shameful. Because when we are good, we <br/>\n&gt;are AWESOME! When we shine it is because, as a group we encourage, support <br/>\n&gt;and unite.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I do not care for the way Helen responded to the UGLY. But I do think it <br/>\n&gt;came from an emotional place of frustration and disappointment that it had <br/>\n&gt;come back again. And let&#39;s face it, when folks start telling other folks to <br/>\n&gt;get on other lists, UGLY has come back in a big way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Shame on us. Do you know what I do when the ugly comes? When the first <br/>\n&gt;whiff of ugly has come I try to ignore it by becoming real friendly with my <br/>\n&gt;delete button. But at times like this, times when UGLY has come back all <br/>\n&gt;the way and brought friends, I leave. That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been off this list <br/>\n&gt;several times and I&#39;m about to do it again. And that&#39;s okay too. Because <br/>\n&gt;the true feeling of this list is strong enough to survive even the ugly and <br/>\n&gt;the disappearance of one or two faces. Ugly is like a fire and if we all <br/>\n&gt;just stop feeding the flames IT WILL GO AWAY.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sooner or later The Good will come back and when it does I and the others <br/>\n&gt;who have already quietly slipped away for a bit will come back. I just hope <br/>\n&gt;in the meantime that we haven&#39;t already permanently alienated some of the <br/>\n&gt;wonderful people on this list who maybe don&#39;t understand our ups and downs. <br/>\n&gt;The list will survive, but it could come back and bloom and thrive if only <br/>\n&gt;we would all work just a little harder to stop feeding the ugly and start <br/>\n&gt;working The Good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, just my two cents, bye all, Jacli :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message: 1 &gt; Date: Sat, 23 Mar 2002 11:58:57 -0800 &gt; From: Helen Hegener <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Checking in/checking out &gt; &gt;Dear friends and listmembers, &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back into the same <br/>\n&gt; &gt;kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was it &gt;months?) <br/>\n&gt;ago. &gt;... It was truly discouraging to see the disparaging remarks &gt;about <br/>\n&gt;our magazine in the middle of this discussion ... &gt; To see our magazine <br/>\n&gt;called into question &gt;because of what someone who happens to write for us <br/>\n&gt;does on this list &gt;was probably the final straw for me. &gt;I&#39;ll be blunt. I <br/>\n&gt;do not have the time nor the interest in being &gt;involved with the kinds of <br/>\n&gt;dynamics I&#39;ve read here in the last few &gt;hours.... &gt; For that reason, I am <br/>\n&gt;removing all &gt;references to HEM from this list, turning this list over to <br/>\n&gt;the &gt;moderators, unsubscribing, and getting on with what needs doing in my <br/>\n&gt; &gt;life. I wish you all the best in finding appropriate resolutions. &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Helen ____________________________________________________________ _ Get <br/>\n&gt;a Taste of Religion: ~LICK A WITCH~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33706,"nextTopicId":33735}}
