Unless, of <br/>\ncourse, I<br/>\nwant to stay employed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some cultures what I do would be considered normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving control over myself is nearly as good as having control over <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intuition nearly makes up for my lack of good judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honor my personality flaws, for without them I would have no <br/>\npersonality at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan of Arc heard voices too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those censorious, <br/>\nself-righteous<br/>\npeople around me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper and <br/>\ncomplain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I learn the innermost secrets of the people around me, they reward <br/>\nme in many<br/>\nways to keep me quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone hurts me, forgiveness is cheaper than a lawsuit. But not <br/>\nnearly as<br/>\ngratifying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first step is to say nice things about myself. The second, to do <br/>\nnice things<br/>\nfor myself. The third, to find someone to buy me nice things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I learn to trust the universe, I no longer need to carry a gun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of me is beautiful and valuable, even the ugly, stupid, and <br/>\ndisgusting parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am at one with my duality.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessed are the flexible, for they can tie themselves into knots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will strive to live each day as if it were my 40th birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself with <br/>\nimaginary fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honour and express all facets of my being, regardless of state and <br/>\nlocal laws.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no <br/>\nsweeter words<br/>\nthan &quot;I told you so.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFalse hope is nicer than no hope at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good scapegoat is nearly as welcome as a solution to the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for today, I will not sit in my living room all day watching TV. <br/>\nInstead I<br/>\nwill move my TV into the bedroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho can I blame for my own problems? Give me just a minute... I&#39;ll <br/>\nfind someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not whether you win or lose, but where you place the blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should I waste my time reliving the past when I can spend it <br/>\nworrying about<br/>\nthe future?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the conspiracy <br/>\nis working.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as sabotage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming aware of my character defects leads me to the next step - <br/>\nblaming my<br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo have a successful relationship I must learn to make it look like <br/>\nI&#39;m giving as<br/>\nmuch as I&#39;m getting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am willing to make the mistakes if someone else is willing to learn <br/>\nfrom them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77628,"nextTopicId":77660}}
