It&#39;s given me (and my whole family) a new<br/>\n  perspective on the ups and downs of life, and on how we want to live our<br/>\n  lives. **<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes,  this is so true for us too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I was diagnosed,  I was somewhat resentful.  Sick of hurting and being tired all the time.   But truly, I didn&#39;t have a clue on how to take care of myself.  I had always exercised and such, but never really listened to my body.   Now I have that ability and am trying to teach my kids the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It has given me a new way of looking at life.  Seeing that you can make things better from something not so great.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  There must be quite a few of us on this list,  if I am remembering correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
