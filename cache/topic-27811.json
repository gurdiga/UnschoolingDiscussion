We ve been here before","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-908474740\">Hmmm, why is it so hard for some folks to accept that their writing style is<br/>\nabrasive and to try to change the &quot;tone&quot; of their writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been here before and had the same discussion over and over and over<br/>\nagain.  It all boils down to how folks present their &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;ideas.&quot;<br/>\nDo they come across as suggestions or helpful hints or anectodal maybe this<br/>\nwill help you or as &quot;I know everything&quot; and &quot;my way is the only way and if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t do it my way you aren&#39;t doing a good job of raising your child.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to who&#39;s been where or how long or earning faith or trust,  that has<br/>\nabsolutely nothing to do with life experiences.  One can be a self-annointed<br/>\ncyber geru for umpteen years and have faith and trust coming out their ears<br/>\nand that has little relevance to first hand experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrary to oft stated *opinions,* they are just that, they are not *facts.*<br/>\nNor does not experiencing something negate the factual basis that someone<br/>\nelse is basing their statements on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kidlets and I can tromp through poison oak until the cows come home and<br/>\nnever get so much as a minor itch.  I&#39;m not going to tell other folks they<br/>\ncan&#39;t be getting great ouzy sores from poison oak because we don&#39;t or<br/>\nbecause I might never have personally met anyone who has.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same applies to part of another discussion--milk.  Who cares if it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bother some folks.  That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t/can&#39;t bother<br/>\nothers.  But then, I can&#39;t understand why anyone would want to allow their<br/>\nchildren to experiment with drinking a fluid that the government says can<br/>\nhave up to &quot;x&quot; percentage of puss in it.  The substance that has to be<br/>\npasteurized inorder to kill various bacteria and viruses that cause life<br/>\nthreatening illnesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda, who will now have to go check her averages since she didn&#39;t know this<br/>\nwas a game or that we were keeping score.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 11/16/01 9:02:13 AM Mountain Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Can someone please explain to me why Sandra can say just about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything she wants here, including subtly bashing one&#39;s entire gender<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with something like, &quot;And it is easy for some parents, especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dads, to expect more of children than they are emotionally and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Because I&#39;m saying things I have reason to believe are true, I&#39;m not<br/>\nsaying<br/>\n&gt; them to be hateful, and my average stays up because I&#39;m helpful here and<br/>\n&gt; other places on the internet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bridget, you or anyone can say anything you want to here, and if people<br/>\nfeel<br/>\n&gt; the urge to defend you, they absolutely can and will.  I&#39;ve spent a few<br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; years earning  faith and trust than you have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of parents are blissfully or willfully unaware of child development<br/>\n&gt; realities.  They expect three year olds to make promises they keep (about<br/>\n&gt; things they&#39;re incapable of understanding or performing) and promise them<br/>\n&gt; then for not keeping their word.  They take six year old boys to doctors<br/>\nif<br/>\n&gt; they can&#39;t read, instead of just waiting two or three years until they can<br/>\n&gt; (during which time those boys can absolutely learn TONS of stuff from<br/>\nbooks<br/>\n&gt; read to them, videos, visits to museums and historic sites,<br/>\nhands-on-stuff),<br/>\n&gt; but instead the parents WANT a diagnosis of ADHD or dyslexis or something<br/>\n&gt; scientific, so they feel like they did the right parental thing.  Moms, as<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; group, seem vastly more in touch with what their kids know and can say and<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; and have been doing than dads, in general, do.  If a mom had no idea if<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; child could tie his shoes or not, it would seem neglect.  Dads, though,<br/>\noften<br/>\n&gt; ask the kid or other kids whether the youngest needs help with the<br/>\nbathroom,<br/>\n&gt; or the kids will tell dad who&#39;s needing a high chair or help reading<br/>\n&gt; subtitles or whatever.  Some dads are totally up to the moment.  Others<br/>\n&gt; choose not to be and few fault them; it&#39;s not their job, in this society.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Yet when she insults someone to the point where they get nasty<br/>\n&gt; back you are right there to jump in and defend her?-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t trying to be insulting, and if someone gets nasty back to a<br/>\n&gt; discussion about federal highways (which, by the way, nobody did except<br/>\nyou),<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s their doing, not mine.  I want to discuss issues. You want to<br/>\ndiscuss<br/>\n&gt; me.  I wish you&#39;d stop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27942,"nextTopicId":27949}}
