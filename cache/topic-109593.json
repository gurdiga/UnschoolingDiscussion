Grocery clerks and managers, baggers, Walmart greeters, waiters, waitresses, cooks, chefs, gas station","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-387505415\">Michael,  <br/>\n<br/>\nMay I respectfully point out the following?<br/>\n<br/>\nGrocery clerks and managers, baggers, Walmart greeters, waiters, <br/>\nwaitresses, cooks, chefs, gas station attendants, autoshop <br/>\nemployees, paint shop employees, corner store owners/employees, <br/>\nstore clerks, store managers, police officers, firemen, ambulance <br/>\ndrivers, mailmen, garbage truck drivers, utility workers, city <br/>\nemployees, contstruction men,  the US MILITARY enlisted and some <br/>\nenlisted that become officers, self employeed business owners, etc. <br/>\netc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about you, but most of those people are public <br/>\nhighschool graduates. If my children choose one of those professions <br/>\nand it makes them happy great, if they choose to be self-employed <br/>\nall the better.  Another way you could look at this whole <br/>\nunschooling issue is the following:  I care and love my children <br/>\nmore than you or anyone else, other than dh, in this whole entire <br/>\nworld.  I want what is best for my children, do you think I&#39;d be <br/>\nunschooling if I thought for a second that they&#39;d end up street <br/>\nbums?  To look at it in that perspective maybe can help shed some <br/>\nlight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe harsh reality is that most welfare recipients and people in this <br/>\ncountry who are below poverty and/or poor were public schooled, not <br/>\nunschooled or homeschooled.  The reality is that most people in this <br/>\ncountry were public schooled and hold down average jobs and make <br/>\nmoney just enough to make it from paycheck to paycheck.  The reality <br/>\nis also that some people are making so much money they don&#39;t have to <br/>\nworry about a thing, yet are some of the most sorry people you&#39;d <br/>\never meet. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read a study the other day that said 64% of highschoolers go onto <br/>\ncollege....33% drop out after 2 years, meaning that over 67% of <br/>\nAmericans did not go to college.  I meet a lot of happy people who <br/>\ndidn&#39;t go to college in all walks of life, and have met college <br/>\ngraduates who are miserable and vice/versa.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\n~Sandra Winn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109588,"nextTopicId":109597}}
