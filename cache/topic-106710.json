Blinking is usually the  first tic <br/>\nthat develops.  One has to have developed two motor tics and one  vocal tic <br/>\n(not at the same time) to be considered TS.  Lots of doctors  don&#39;t know the <br/>\ncriteria, and they assume that a cursing tic is one of the  markers.  Very few <br/>\npeople with TS have a vocal tic that requires  cursing--it&#39;s just a stereotype <br/>\nfostered by the media.  The book &quot;Icy  Sparks&quot; is about a girl with TS, and <br/>\nthe way it is described in the book is  totally outside my experience and <br/>\nreading about folks with the disorder,  although it can appear that way to people <br/>\nwho don&#39;t understand it.  The  author clearly didn&#39;t understand it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a bad, horrible thing to have TS.  It&#39;s just nice to know it  has a <br/>\nname when looking for ways to adapt.  And it&#39;s highly genetic, so if  it runs <br/>\nin your family, it runs in your family--whether or not there are bad  family <br/>\ndynamics.  It can get worse around puberty and then taper off during  <br/>\nadulthood.  It&#39;s a lifelong condition, though.  My 20 yo son with  TS says he has very <br/>\nfew bothersome tics now (I haven&#39;t seen him in some  time, but last time I did <br/>\nhe was scrunching his nose a lot).  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe thing that concerns me the most about my son having TS is the possible  <br/>\ncomorbid development of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which happens to a <br/>\nnumber  of people with TS.  Having severe OCD is not a happy way to live.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5094431,"authorName":"Renee Seawell","from":"Renee Seawell &lt;Rseawell@...&gt;","profile":"rseawell","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Question: Nervous tics in children and asthma","postDate":"1119359972","msgId":106861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjIxMTMxOTMyLjgzNjEzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0MzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgyLjJhNzMzOGJjLjJmZTkwYjg5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":106858,"nextInTopic":106863,"prevInTime":106860,"nextInTime":106862,"topicId":106710,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Amy:  My name is Renee and I am 42.

At about the age of 4 we noticed our youngest son<br/>\nwas starting to have a sort of tick.  It was most prominent when he was playing video games.  I<br/>\ntook him to a pediatric neurologist and he assured me he would grow out of it.  Well I was sure he<br/>\nhad what I have.  It got better and then when he was around 12-13 we noticed it again.  He&#39;s now<br/>\n15 and it seems to have gone away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never understood because they told me that my tremor is inherited but they assured me his is<br/>\nnot.
