Her daughter <br/>\nis 12 and has Down&#39;s Syndrome, pretty high functioning from what I <br/>\ncould tell. She mentioned that she homeschooled her and was eager to <br/>\nask me lots of questions when she found out that we unschool. Her <br/>\nmain concern was math. Well actually, her first concern was really <br/>\nthat she was looking for &quot;permission&quot; to live and play more and &quot;do <br/>\nschoolwork&quot; less. I was able to handle that fine. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nShe told me of her daughter&#39;s passion for birds and wildlife and her <br/>\nability to recognize and name even rare species. She also shared <br/>\nfeeling guilty because all they did was can fruit and veggies from <br/>\ntheir garden in September, an activity which her daughter loved. <br/>\n(They &quot;got a late start for school.&quot;) I set her straight (as *I* see <br/>\nit) and she was open and ready to hear what I had to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut her concern with math is that her daughter does not seen to have <br/>\none to one number correlation. She doesn&#39;t get the idea of counting, <br/>\nI guess, and so can&#39;t move forward with any math program. I channeled <br/>\nwhat I could of Pam Sorooshian to her &lt;g&gt; and explained about games <br/>\nand hands on and thinking mathematically and how it doesn&#39;t need to <br/>\nlook like pages of worksheets. But now I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s <br/>\nsomething more to it in light of her daughter&#39;s Down Syndrome. Is it <br/>\nmore necessary to drill with these kids? My sense is that this is <br/>\nwhat wasn&#39;t working anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo does anyone have any  other fab ideas for helping this mom play <br/>\nability appropriate number games that might help with the one to one <br/>\ncorrelation?<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez this is long.
