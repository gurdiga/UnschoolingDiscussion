If a woman believes in and practices &#39;surrender&#39; <br/>\nand obedience and all that, there&#39;s no sense insulting it.  It is difficult <br/>\nfor unschooling to cohabitate with such choices, true.  It&#39;s a common pattern <br/>\nfor structured Christian homeschoolers to consider the husband the <br/>\nsuperintendant of the home school, and the mother the teacher.  For many of <br/>\nthose families obedience is the #1 priority:  child&#39;s obedience to mother, <br/>\nmother&#39;s obedience to husband, husband&#39;s obedience to God.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been Baptist and known (been related to, too) lots of fundamentalists, <br/>\nI know they&#39;re sincere, I know they have a large support base, and they think <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing the one true right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are resources for Christian unschoolers, and there are unschoolers <br/>\neven among some of the staunchest Bible-believing Christians.
