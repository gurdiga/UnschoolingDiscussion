Here&#39;s my whole post:<br/>\n******&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to articulate this for a while, <br/>\nand this seems like a window to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the best approach is a two pronged effort where we focus on <br/>\nthe need behind the behavior as well as offering important information <br/>\nand feedback as to the behavior as a choice of expression. People do <br/>\nhave a choice in how they express themselves and there are better and <br/>\nworse ways to do that--better and worse in terms of Respect for the <br/>\nother person, but also better and worse in terms of achieving a goal, <br/>\nboth of which I think need to be talked about. I think problems arise <br/>\nwith focusing exclusively on the behavior OR exclusively on the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree that this discussion is not always best done in the <br/>\nmoment though there are times when it is and can be, at least, briefly <br/>\naddressed. It&#39;s a delicate, situational balance that I try to strike. <br/>\nBut I truly believe that the discussion *needs* to happen at some point, <br/>\nif not in the moment or as an immediate follow-up, then as a revisiting <br/>\n(later in the day or week) or a reapplication (as in taking something <br/>\nthey can easily see in a tv show, for instance, and helping them apply <br/>\nit to a recent incident in their own life). There are times when not <br/>\noffering information as the opportunity naturally occurs, robs our <br/>\nchildren of the chance to learn from life. I&#39;m not saying anything <br/>\nremotely close to offering etiquette lessons. I&#39;m talking about genuine <br/>\nfeedback as to our reactions, potential general reactions of others <br/>\noutside the home, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have recently pointed out the problem with comparing children to <br/>\nspouses, though I still think it holds up in terms of my treatment if <br/>\nnot their freedom of possibility in the wider world, but I think another <br/>\nuseful analogy, for me anyway, is the idea of a foreign traveler.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person came to visit us, putting us in a position of responsibility <br/>\nas their host, and we continually focused only on meeting the need <br/>\nrather than discussing the choice of expressing that need, chances are <br/>\nwe&#39;d be doing that person a disservice. If, for instance, we focused <br/>\nexclusively on the need, say operating an elevator, and we showed him <br/>\nhow to operate the elevator by pushing the appropriate button and giving <br/>\nthe corresponding numbers for the person&#39;s understanding, we would meet <br/>\nthe immediate need, and he&#39;d likely know how to operate future elevators <br/>\njust fine. Both useful services we&#39;ve provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if we haven&#39;t addressed the notion of personal space and tone when <br/>\nasking for help--expressing his need--then the next time that visitor <br/>\nhas a need he will be no better equipped to consider his expression or <br/>\nto express it in the circumstances in which he finds himself. If it <br/>\nhappens with someone less generous or understanding, he could be open to <br/>\nsome rather negative reactions. We wouldn&#39;t be very good hosts if we <br/>\nallowed that to happen through an error of omission, in my opinion. I <br/>\nsee my responsibility as a parent as even greater than my responsibility <br/>\nas a host. &quot;********<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did someone actually recommend that?   That being (somehow, falsely,<br/>\n&gt; infuriatingly) &quot;non judgmental&quot; could in ANY way increase trust?   <br/>\n&gt; Strengthen<br/>\n&gt; relationships.   AID COMMUNICATION!???<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s there to communicate if there&#39;s no discussion of one thing being<br/>\n&gt; better or worse than another?   If there are no ideals, no joys, no <br/>\n&gt; successes, no<br/>\n&gt; excitements over accomplishment, what&#39;s there to talk about?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, much of this is based on the beliefs of Marshall <br/>\nRosenberg--Non-Violent Communication, and I believe that Alfie Kohn, <br/>\ntoo, in his recent book _Unconditional Parenting_ makes the point that <br/>\nit&#39;s not possible to judge the behavior without also judging the child. <br/>\nSo, much of this is the outgrowth of our book discussions, and several <br/>\npeople believe very strongly in these ideas.

All we knew was they were <br/>\ngirls from two different middle schools.

The AU list is having <br/>\na bit of a debate again, and I&#39;d like, for my part, to bring it to a <br/>\nlarger forum--I&#39;m also posting at Unschooling.info under the &quot;parenting&quot; <br/>\nfolder. I know part of this is problematic because it&#39;s not technically <br/>\nan Unschooling issue when children are under 5 (that&#39;s mandatory school <br/>\nage where I live). But, taken in the context of an Unschooling lifestyle <br/>\nand factoring in age-appropriate expectations, I see the issue on a <br/>\ncontinuum about whether or not judgment is useful or possible when <br/>\nrelationships are the priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, there is agreement that undesirable behavior is most <br/>\noften an expression of an unmet need--whether he&#39;s hungry, feeling <br/>\nignored, whatever--agreement on the priority being to meet the <br/>\nunderlying need. The questions arise over whether to address the <br/>\n*expression* of the need, whether to judge the *method* of meeting the <br/>\nneed, whether it is useful for a parent to *label* the behavior or the <br/>\nchoice in a particular instance as worse and whether to discuss better <br/>\npossible choices in future similar situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, is it productive parenting/ useful in an Unschooling <br/>\ncontext to discuss choices on a better-worse continuum and help our <br/>\nchildren find better tools to use in place of worse ones, or is any form <br/>\nof judgment better/ worse likely to undermine trust, relationships and <br/>\ncommunication?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some of the things I&#39;ve written on the topic fwiw...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I believe the best approach is a two pronged effort where we focus on <br/>\nthe need behind the behavior as well as offering important information <br/>\nand feedback as to the behavior as a choice of expression. People do <br/>\nhave a choice in how they express themselves and there are better and <br/>\nworse ways to do that--better and worse in terms of Respect for the <br/>\nother person, but also better and worse in terms of achieving a goal, <br/>\nboth of which I think need to be talked about. I think problems arise <br/>\nwith focusing exclusively on the behavior OR exclusively on the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree that this discussion is not always best done in the <br/>\nmoment though there are times when it is and can be, at least, briefly <br/>\naddressed. It&#39;s a delicate, situational balance that I try to strike. <br/>\nBut I truly believe that the discussion *needs* to happen at some point, <br/>\nif not in the moment or as an immediate follow-up, then as a revisiting <br/>\n(later in the day or week) or a reapplication (as in taking something <br/>\nthey can easily see in a tv show, for instance, and helping them apply <br/>\nit to a recent incident in their own life). There are times when not <br/>\noffering information as the opportunity naturally occurs, robs our <br/>\nchildren of the chance to learn from life. I&#39;m not saying anything <br/>\nremotely close to offering etiquette lessons. I&#39;m talking about genuine <br/>\nfeedback as to our reactions, potential general reactions of others <br/>\noutside the home, etc.&quot;<br/>\n*****<br/>\n&quot;For me, it becomes a matter of looking past the behavior to the need <br/>\nand the choice. In other words, instead of seeing a &quot;misbehaving&quot; child, <br/>\nwhere the focus is on the behavior itself, we see a needy child who made <br/>\na poor choice. By seeing the need and the choice, we are able to address <br/>\nboth while still seeing the Whole Child, free of labels. By seeing the <br/>\nchoice, we keep the behavior within the moment rather than extrapolating <br/>\nit to include most moments or a way of being. But, most importantly, we <br/>\nempower the child to make a better choice the next time they face that <br/>\nneed, which empowers them to live in a world with other people.&quot;<br/>\n*****<br/>\n&quot;I have three children *very* close in age--who all are in similar <br/>\ndevelopmental stages in terms of empathy, etc. I cannot, personally, <br/>\nimagine what my house would look like if we didn&#39;t talk about choices, <br/>\nif we didn&#39;t brainstorm together more successful--i.e better--ways to <br/>\nget our needs met. This has been a crucial step for us in understanding <br/>\neach other and living together. So, it&#39;s difficult for me to see life <br/>\nwithout voicing the &quot;hitting hurts&quot; or &quot;I felt sad when you called me <br/>\nx.&quot; As I said in my book discussion post, I can see many of Rosenberg&#39;s <br/>\npoints about communication, but they are so wordy and involve so many <br/>\nsteps that I can&#39;t see them working for problem solving amongst many <br/>\nsmall children, though I do find *myself* acting as interpreter of needs <br/>\nafter such statements as &quot;I felt sad when you called me x.&quot; I do those <br/>\nextra steps, hoping that my children will someday be able to do them for <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s possible to talk about an array of choices. I think it&#39;s <br/>\npossible and even beneficial to talk about them in terms of better <br/>\nchoices and worse choices. I&#39;m very interested in this, and I&#39;m going to <br/>\nopen it up personally (without references to others here) to the UD list <br/>\nbecause I would like to hear a wider range of voices for my own personal <br/>\ngrowth.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (6), Sam (5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77066,"nextTopicId":107907}}
