It was how I <br/>\nunderstood serving my family. Sandra and a few others like Tia <br/>\nand Ren shared about serving their families through housework, <br/>\nlaundry and meal making. If ther dishes were dirty after lunch <br/>\nand no one thought to clear the table, they didn&#39;t yell or demand <br/>\nor clear them in huff. They cleared them gladly and with love.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS was the turning point for me. I realized I had fallen into the <br/>\ntrap of feeling I was owed service and clean up by my kids and <br/>\ntherefore grew resentful if they didn&#39;t keep their end of the <br/>\nbargain I had coerced into existence.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first two months, I kept my mouth shut about chores, <br/>\nmesses, undone laundry etc. If there was a mess, I picked it up if <br/>\nit bugged me. And I said yes to every request I possibly could: <br/>\ndriving, playing games, arranging friends to play at our house, <br/>\nwatching movies together. I spent a huge amount of my energy <br/>\nat sports events (games), driving my teens to their social lives, <br/>\npurchasing art supplies and so on. I wanted my kids to know that <br/>\nthey mattered more to me than any other consideration in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time (multiple months), I got into a habit of service and not <br/>\nresenting. (During this time, the kids still did help with <br/>\nhousework once a weekÂ—we held that over as we adjusted to <br/>\nunschooling). But it was during this time that I discovered that we <br/>\ncould even re-think that weekly Sat. morning cleaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy mid summer, life was just much more relaxed. There are <br/>\ndays when I have PMS and I get edgy about messes. But on the <br/>\nwhole, the spirit of the home has changed. And the spirit now <br/>\nprevalent is consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the heavy investment of my life into theirs (making their <br/>\ndreams come true) has hit. They KNOW I&#39;m for them first. And <br/>\nsuddenly they are pouring out the love, support, help and service <br/>\nI used to think needed coercion.
