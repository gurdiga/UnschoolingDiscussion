I try to listen to &quot;what do I<br/>\nfeel like?&quot; I avoid dairy because of lactose intolerance (I miss pizza and<br/>\ncream sauces but not much), and super spicy food because it&#39;ll give me<br/>\nheartburn. I just don&#39;t stuff myself. When PMS&#39;ing, I crave chocolate or<br/>\nmeringues. I give in to those cravings. I have renounced any form of calorie<br/>\ncounting, or narrow definitions of diets (caveat: when I was pregnant I<br/>\nfollowed Bradley). I like almost all fruits, and rice and sushi. I never<br/>\nthink of salads, unless reminded, but I always enjoy them when they&#39;re in<br/>\nfront of me. I&#39;m a big sandwich consumer - as in sliced bread, not burgers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I get hungry I tend to notice heartburn or sudden grazing as cues, before<br/>\nany sense of emptiness these days. If I am cranky, I think about when I last<br/>\nate and take steps appropriately. I went back to my pre-pregnancy weight<br/>\nwithin 6 months with no particular effort, and have not changed my weight or<br/>\nsize since. I usually drink water ahead of other beverages. I drink coffee<br/>\nand green tea. I don&#39;t drink alcohol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a 15 year vegetarian until 5 years ago. When I reinstituted meat I<br/>\nexpected to notice some difference in my health. I didn&#39;t, with the<br/>\nexception of becoming lactose intolerant a couple of years later, something<br/>\nthat would have caused me some problems of variety if I were still vegie.<br/>\nCheese particularly had been a major feature of my diet while vegetarian. My<br/>\ndoctor said &quot;take calcium&quot; and recommended the soft chew kind which I take<br/>\ndaily. When I remember I take a multivitamin and extra Folic acid, just in<br/>\ncase. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a very good cook, as I finally had to admit. For years I thought of<br/>\nmy cooking as quirky but delicious. Eventually I learnt to my dismay that<br/>\n*I* was the only person who actually liked my thrown together odd<br/>\nconcoctions. Now I stick to really simple cooking for my family, or<br/>\ncarefully following a recipe. I enjoy baking, and will make muffins or<br/>\nsomething like that if I need to take something for a crowd - but I don&#39;t<br/>\nfool around with the recipes because that leads to disasters. I stick to<br/>\ntried and true most of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that answers the query OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I read many stories here on these lists about odd food<br/>\npreferences turning out temporary and that for *most* of our children good<br/>\nhealth was continuing without the parents needing to take charge of their<br/>\nchildren&#39;s eating.

However Jayn suffers from no such issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have observed her eating habits and can make some reasoned predictions<br/>\nabout what she is likely to want, but the original premises - that she was<br/>\ncapable of making choices that worked, that food did not have to be endowed<br/>\nwith emotional loadings (beyond enjoyment), and that, nutritional pyramids<br/>\nnotwithstanding, food need not be sorted into a good/bad hierarchy - these<br/>\nhold true for Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like there are a couple of instances mentioned on the list about<br/>\nchildren with medical or other issues that impact their ability to listen to<br/>\ntheir bodies.

If we have a<br/>\ntiny bit, we start wanting lots of sugar again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering if it has to be that way.  I don&#39;t expect Dmitri to<br/>\ngrow up with a ban on sugar or white bread; I have confidence that he&#39;ll be<br/>\nable to self-regulate.  But are his parents permanently damaged?  I had<br/>\nhopes that we could also learn to self-regulate with no strict bans as he<br/>\nstarts his journey into eating food along with us.  I guess we&#39;ve still got<br/>\ntime to learn, though.  He&#39;s still exclusively breastfed!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie in NY</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Food controls & deschooling adults","postDate":"1128962028","msgId":108818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJGNDlCMUQwLTc2QjktNDM5My05MjQ0LTNGRTA5NEIyMDk4MEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBJTzQwMEJCRDFTTjBRSzJAdm1zMDQ2Lm1haWxzcnZjcy5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDBJTzQwMEJCRDFTTjBRSzJAdm1zMDQ2Lm1haWxzcnZjcy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":108814,"nextInTopic":108822,"prevInTime":108817,"nextInTime":108819,"topicId":108814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

While I found it  <br/>\neasier to not get piggy about snacks if I didn&#39;t forbid myself to  <br/>\nhave them I still found that answering a craving for a candy bar or  <br/>\ncookies often made me just want more. :-/ And I had a lot of &quot;I want  <br/>\nsomething but I don&#39;t know what I want&quot; feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s 2 weeks of no carbohydrates then slowly reintroducing them,  <br/>\nchoosing whole grains rather than refined so the goal is to eat a  <br/>\nregular diet -- just healthier. Even after a couple days I wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nhaving the &quot;I don&#39;t know what I wants,&quot; and didn&#39;t crave huge plates  <br/>\nof pasta (still don&#39;t and I did it 6 months ago). You actually eat a  <br/>\nlot of food and it includes fat so i rarely felt hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it very very easy to do online. (http:// <br/>\nwww.southbeachdiet.com/index3.asp) They give you a week&#39;s worth of  <br/>\nrecipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks -- you can pick other  <br/>\nrecipes if you don&#39;t like their suggestions for the week but I liked  <br/>\nmost of them -- and you can print out a shopping list (that you can  <br/>\npre-edit to remove the things you already have). They have a recipe  <br/>\nbook too that&#39;s cheaper than doing it on line but not quite as handy  <br/>\nor nifty. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180118032,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;julesmiel@...&gt;","profile":"julesmiel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Food controls & deschooling adults","postDate":"1128890896","msgId":108814,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBJTzQwMEJCRDFTTjBRSzJAdm1zMDQ2Lm1haWxzcnZjcy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108818,"prevInTime":108813,"nextInTime":108815,"topicId":108814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I joined this list while pregnant, and I m back to reading avidly now that my son is 5-1/2 months old.

I&#39;m finding that much of what you say applies<br/>\nto life with an infant--strewing, giving him a rich and interesting<br/>\nenvironment, communicating respectfully, avoiding coercion, etc.--so thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I&#39;ve been reading with interest on Sandra&#39;s site, particularly about<br/>\nfood issues.  Maybe it&#39;s because Dmitri is just starting to show some<br/>\ninterest in starting solids.  I know my husband and I want to model healthy,<br/>\nnon-controlling attitudes toward food, but we&#39;re not there yet.  I&#39;m looking<br/>\nfor stories of your experiences deschooling yourselves when it comes to food<br/>\nissues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur particular issue is that my husband and I, at least according to the way<br/>\nwe&#39;re perceiving things now, are &quot;addicted&quot; to sugar and white flour.  We<br/>\nare currently in a healthy mode (whole grains/no sugar) and feeling<br/>\nphysically good, but we&#39;re only eating this way through a kind of rigid<br/>\nself-discipline.  We both REALLY want &quot;the bad stuff&quot; at times but don&#39;t<br/>\ntrust ourselves to have access to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do we do?  Continue on this path of self-denial or stuff a couple of<br/>\nluscious Ritter dark chocolate marzipan bars into our gaping maws?  I&#39;m<br/>\ntreating myself like an adult controlling a child:  &quot;All she&#39;ll do is eat<br/>\ncandy all day.  She&#39;ll NEVER eat any kale if I don&#39;t make her!&quot;  In light of<br/>\nmy past behavior (overconsumption of junk and underconsumption of veggies),<br/>\nthis seems to be true.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any hope for me and dh?  I think if we can trust ourselves with<br/>\nfood, we&#39;ll certainly be able to trust Dmitri without reservations.  Your<br/>\ntales of how you de-food-schooled yourselves are most welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJulie in NY</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109060,"nextTopicId":109068}}
