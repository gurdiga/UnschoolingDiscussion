I do really enjoy the magazine<br/>\n(not to mention that they just published my article!) so I don&#39;t want to<br/>\ncome across as bitter but I did want to point out that a lot of the concerns<br/>\nexpressed are not applicable to unschoolers (or life learners, as is their<br/>\nnaming preference).<br/>\n___________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Life Learning,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article &quot;Computers for Kids - Learning Tools or Imagination Stunters&quot;<br/>\ndid not seem to fit in well with the overall life learning approach of the<br/>\nmagazine.  I would imagine that with the random-digit dial telephone survery<br/>\nof 1,000 parents that they conducted for the study &quot;Zero to Six: Electronic<br/>\nMedia in the Lives of Infants, Toddlers and Preschoolers&quot; they did not come<br/>\nin contact with very many (if any) parents taking an unschooling or life<br/>\nlearning approach to computers, or multimedia in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article states that &quot;critics of early computer use are concerned that<br/>\ncomputers will replace opportunities for hands-on manipulation in real-life,<br/>\nreal-time situations.&quot;  And this seems to be the motivation behind the<br/>\nAlliance for Childhood&#39;s &quot;Call for Action&quot; calling for, among other actions:<br/>\n&quot;a refocusing in education, at home and school, on the essentials of a<br/>\nhealthy childhood: strong bonds with caring adults; time for spontaneous,<br/>\ncreative play; a curriculum rich in music and the other arts; reading books<br/>\naloud; storytelling and poetry; rhythm and movement; cooking, building<br/>\nthings and other handcrafts; and gardening and other hands-on experiences of<br/>\nnature and the physical world.&quot;  It seems they are talking about mainstream<br/>\nparents who they are concerned are using multimedia outlets (TV and<br/>\ncomputers) to keep their kids occupied at the expense of exploring the<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; world and building meaningful relationships with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly the Zero to Six study did *not* find that electronic media is<br/>\nfrequently being used as a &quot;babysitter&quot;, with young kids being left alone<br/>\nfor many hours with no adult presence or guidance.  &quot;The vast majority of<br/>\nparents (85%) reported that most of the time, the child was watching with<br/>\nsomeone else.  Moreover, 69% of parents  reported that they were in the room<br/>\neither all or most of the time their child was watching.&quot;  They do concede<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t know whether the parent was actually watching the show with<br/>\nwith their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the majority of the readers of this magazine do not have kids in<br/>\ndaycare or school.  And their life learning kids are living real-life<br/>\nhands-on with the full active participation of caring parents.  The &quot;Call<br/>\nfor Action&quot; list sounds like many of the activities a young life learner<br/>\nwould come into contact with regularly!  And without the burden of a daycare<br/>\nor school schedule a life learning child does not have to wait until<br/>\nevenings and weekends to pursue these real-life interests so it&#39;s not an<br/>\neither-or situation.  I agree with Seymour Papert that problems with<br/>\ncomputer use arise when it is &quot;isolated from the learning process and from<br/>\nlife, rather than integrated into the whole.&quot;  Time that our kids spend with<br/>\ncomputers and the TV does not take away from real life, it&#39;s just another<br/>\npart of it.  Life learners are uniquely able to pursue their interests and<br/>\nlearning by living freely every day using any and all avenues available.<br/>\n_____________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135843572,"authorName":"24hrmom","from":"&quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;24hrmom@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Latest Life Learning magazine.","postDate":"1085053689","msgId":94308,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMDMwMWM0M2U2MCQ1MmJmY2FhMCQwMjAwYThjMEBUaW5rZXJiZWxsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDM0aGhqbiQ1b3FrcjFAdG9pcDUuYmVsbG5leHhpYS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":94307,"nextInTopic":94316,"prevInTime":94307,"nextInTime":94309,"topicId":94294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-915447541\">&lt;&lt; The fact that this was such a different point of view from any of the<br/>\nothers I have read about in that magazine, with so much schoolish jargon<br/>\nthrown in, was what made it such a startling disappointment. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was really quite shocked as I read that particular article as well.

She talked about the length of some of the fan fiction chapters<br/>\nand stories she&#39;s read and I mentioned averages and we worked out the<br/>\naverage number of pages per chapter for a couple of her fave stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention I love unschooling?!<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":234387,"authorName":"Andrea","from":"Andrea &lt;andrea@...&gt;","profile":"runmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Latest Life Learning magazine.","postDate":"1085047671","msgId":94305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4xLjEuMS4yMDA0MDUyMDA3MDM1OS4wMmM2YmM5MEBwb3AxLm5zLnN5bXBhdGljby5jYT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGFhLjJjNDAzMjUxLjJkZGQyNjQ0QGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGFhLjJjNDAzMjUxLjJkZGQyNjQ0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":94303,"nextInTopic":94307,"prevInTime":94304,"nextInTime":94306,"topicId":94294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She sees computers as a distraction from &quot;interaction with caring<br/>\nadults and from the hands-on exploration and play that lay the true<br/>\nfoundations for learning.&quot; (Not in my house.) She also wrote a lot about<br/>\nwhat seems to be life divided into academic subjects and discussions of<br/>\n&quot;academic achievement&quot;. At best this is writing about stuff that is entirely<br/>\nirrelevant to unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m vaguely concerned that she is going to bring that anti-media agenda to<br/>\nthe Conference, but if that is the case, since I don&#39;t want to be grumping<br/>\nand harrumphing unpleasantly in my seat, I am not obliged to attend her<br/>\nparticular presentation. I would have no expectation of being able to change<br/>\nher view with my anecdotal evidence (the foundation of this list after all<br/>\nis the combined anecdotal evidence of those who have gone before),<br/>\nespecially since she is very impressed by the list of child advocates and<br/>\nexperts who appended themselves onto a group promoting these anti-computer<br/>\nfindings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that this was such a different point of view from any of the others<br/>\nI have read about in that magazine, with so much schoolish jargon thrown in,<br/>\nwas what made it such a startling disappointment. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Well there&#39;s my column in Home Education Magazine!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reminding me that this publication exists. What proportion of the<br/>\nmagazine is actually about unschooling issues (other than Sandra&#39;s<br/>\ncontributions)? I don&#39;t need heaps more info flying at me about how to<br/>\ncombine curriculums or &quot;make math fun!&quot; I can get that junk for free at Park<br/>\nDays. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;One of the articles from the newest Life Learning was sent to me after the<br/>\n<br/>\nmagazine came out for website use, and it here (Thank you Pam Laricchia!!)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved Pam Laricchia&#39;s article both times I read it - on line and in the LL<br/>\nmagazine.
