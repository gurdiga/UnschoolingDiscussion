It&#39;s against overconsumption.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad to see this topic here, even if it is a bit off the path from<br/>\nUnschooling. Life&#39;s lessons and the world economy, our impact on others,<br/>\netc. are all a part of what we are trying to bring to our children&#39;s lives.<br/>\nIf I had thought about it, I should have contacted you John, we were in<br/>\nPortland for Thanksgiving after spending a lovely time at Timberline Lodge<br/>\non Wednesday (what a beautiful place!), and we spent Friday at OMSI before<br/>\ngoing to the tree lighting in Pioneer square. Maybe next year we will join<br/>\nyou for the Buy Nothing Day, though we did have fun at OMSI.<br/>\nIMHO, the day-after-Thanksgiving sales are usually a crock anyways - maybe<br/>\none or two items are really on sale, and the rest are marked down from<br/>\nalready-overinflated prices. If you really want to save money, shop the day<br/>\nafter Christmas. That&#39;s when the stores have decided they&#39;ve wrung all the<br/>\nmoney out of consumers that they can for the holiday season, and cut their<br/>\nlosses. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for us, we just plain old don&#39;t do the mall shopping thing at ALL. It<br/>\ndrives me up a tree, I guess I&#39;m one of those shopping-challenged women,<br/>\nLOL! For Christmas, we give hand-made gifts. We might include the<br/>\nfire-started pinecones, this year, that&#39;s a great idea! We&#39;re giving some<br/>\njars of jam we canned earlier this year, some beeswax rolled candles,<br/>\nhome-made cookies and fudge, and a homemade ornament. We also give animals<br/>\nfrom Heifer Project ( www.heifer.org ).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo John, thanks for continuing to share your unconventional ideas, I always<br/>\nfind them interesting to read. I was especially interested in your essay on<br/>\njobs. My husband started his own business doing aircraft detailing (or as he<br/>\nsays, he&#39;s a &quot;glorified janitor&quot;) and we&#39;ve found it gives us tons of<br/>\nflexibility, time, and the ability for him to be his own boss, and it pays<br/>\nwell. My step-brother similarly has his own business cleaning range-hoods<br/>\nfor big restaurants. He travels all over the country, makes tons of money,<br/>\nand loves it. There are tons of niche-markets in the cleaning industry that<br/>\nare lucrative and not very time-intensive. It&#39;s great for people to know the<br/>\nrange of possibilities out there!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;Some mommies send their nummy milk up into the<br/>\nsky and that becoms the milky way at night&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who does somersaults<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14236,"nextTopicId":14259}}
