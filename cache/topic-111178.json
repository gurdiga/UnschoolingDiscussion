Couching the definition in terms of what<br/>\nunschooling is &quot;not&quot; academically is the simplest first step to <br/>\nexplaining,<br/>\nand allows the ideas to have the hook of the normal to hang on <br/>\ninitially.<br/>\nThe oft made recommendations of being gradual in change are designed <br/>\nfor the<br/>\ncomfort and ease of the children, even more so than the parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is when the descriptions and explanations of what unschooling *is* <br/>\nand<br/>\nhow it works start coming, that many people seem to retreat into the<br/>\nfamiliar. They want to continue to use the word &quot;Consequences&quot;<br/>\neuphemistically for punishments. They want to continue to consider<br/>\nPrinciples as merely Rules restated gently, rather than a life <br/>\naltering<br/>\nmethodology. They want to continue to be comfortable in the <br/>\nstandardized<br/>\nresearch about child development and behavior  all based essentially <br/>\non how<br/>\nto keep kids &quot;doing better&quot; in school and manipulate them into acting<br/>\ncertain approved ways  instead of looking at their own children as<br/>\noutstandingly unique individuals. Sometimes they want to continue to <br/>\ntake<br/>\ncredit for their normal children&#39;s normal accomplishments  like they<br/>\n&quot;taught their baby to walk and talk&quot;. So they ask, nervously or <br/>\ndefiantly,<br/>\n&quot;But isn&#39;t unschooling really just simply not doing school?

Other folks take the <br/>\ntrust developed in that academic area and extend it to the rest of <br/>\nlife. If Joan can set her own path (with my guidance and facilitation <br/>\nas needed) in learning what she needs for her life goals, then I also <br/>\ntrust that (with my guidance and facilitation as needed) she can make <br/>\nher own choices about what and when to eat, when and how long to <br/>\nsleep, and so on...it spreads to all of life (thus a common <br/>\nphrase &#39;whole life unschooling&#39; - maybe using that phrase could help <br/>\nyou &#39;wrap around&#39; the idea?). And some folks come at it from the other <br/>\ndirection - they start out trusting their babies to eat, sleep, and <br/>\ndevelop/learn in their own unique ways and don&#39;t see any reason to <br/>\nstop trusting that once the child reaches &#39;school age&#39;. Here again <br/>\nit&#39;s trust extending over all of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;ve mostly focused on the academic side of things (and some <br/>\ngeneral things) above I&#39;d like to touch on this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;... sense of school at home and discipline. Neither philosophy as I <br/>\nunderstand it include these..... &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nDepends on what you mean by &#39;discipline&#39;. If you mean a person who is <br/>\nfollowing another&#39;s instructions, seeking to be like a respected other <br/>\nperson (becoming a disciple in the denotational sense, not the <br/>\nreligious context) or one who is setting themselves to accomplish a <br/>\ngoal and doing whatever is required (hours of physical training for <br/>\nexample as in a &#39;disciplined athlete&#39;), then that is very much a part <br/>\nof unschooling and radical unschooling (whole life unschooling) - each <br/>\nperson directs their course. If by discipline you are referring to a <br/>\nsystem of rules with punishments and rewards designed to mold or <br/>\nmodify behavior to someone else&#39;s standards, then I&#39;d say that <br/>\nunschooling (in the academic only sense) might or might not include <br/>\nthis.

Or could we discuss what other see as differences<br/>\nin the two? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote this recently:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Generally for the purposes of discussion on these lists unschooling is<br/>\ntrusting that you children can and will learn all the academic skills and<br/>\ninformation that need to live fully without enforced lessons - the &quot;not<br/>\ndoing school&quot; part. The parents&#39; job is to create the environment, both<br/>\nphysical and mental, wherein interests and passions can be discovered and<br/>\nfacilitated. <br/>\n<br/>\nRadical Unschooling is extending that Trust to all areas of your whole life,<br/>\nliving by general Principles such as Honesty, Kindness, Respect, Acceptance,<br/>\nGenerosity instead of having rules, chores, required behaviors, punishments<br/>\nof any sort. It is about building relationships, respecting children as<br/>\nautonomous beings and creating an environment where the freedom to make real<br/>\nchoices is fostered and individual preferences honored as much as possible<br/>\nwithin real practical constraints (as opposed to having some kind of<br/>\nbehavioral control agenda). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;link&quot; here. To an essay or article? To an<br/>\nunschooling e-list that is not RU?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something else that I wrote once on AU - maybe something useful here<br/>\nfor you:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;When someone, usually a newbie or “considering it” individual comes to<br/>\nthese lists and wants a definition of unschooling, part of the purpose is to<br/>\nnot sound too terrifying, not to create a yawning black vortex of the<br/>\nunknown right off the bat. Couching the definition in terms of what<br/>\nunschooling is “not” academically is the simplest first step to explaining,<br/>\nand allows the ideas to have the hook of the normal to hang on initially.<br/>\nThe oft made recommendations of being gradual in change are designed for the<br/>\ncomfort and ease of the children, even more so than the parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is when the descriptions and explanations of what unschooling *is* and<br/>\nhow it works start coming, that many people seem to retreat into the<br/>\nfamiliar. They want to continue to use the word “Consequences”<br/>\neuphemistically for punishments. They want to continue to consider<br/>\nPrinciples as merely Rules restated gently, rather than a life altering<br/>\nmethodology. They want to continue to be comfortable in the standardized<br/>\nresearch about child development and behavior – all based essentially on how<br/>\nto keep kids “doing better” in school and manipulate them into acting<br/>\ncertain approved ways – instead of looking at their own children as<br/>\noutstandingly unique individuals. Sometimes they want to continue to take<br/>\ncredit for their normal children’s normal accomplishments – like they<br/>\n“taught their baby to walk and talk”. So they ask, nervously or defiantly,<br/>\n“But isn’t unschooling really just simply not doing school? Aren’t I still<br/>\nan unschooler if I’m not a radical unschooler?”<br/>\n<br/>\n Long time Unschoolers answer reassuringly, “Well, yes *technically*, in<br/>\nterms of a dictionary style definition, it is possible to only unschool<br/>\nacademics”. I have long had the sneaking suspicion that the cognoscenti are<br/>\nmetaphorically winking at each other and grinning behind their hands. They<br/>\nalready understand that the overwhelming experience and practice of people<br/>\nwho are posting (can’t speak about people who never post), is that over time<br/>\nalmost everyone ends up extending the philosophies and practices (more or<br/>\nless) towards “Whole Life Unschooling”, a phrase I like to use sometimes<br/>\nbecause it is both more descriptive, and may sound gentler than “Radical<br/>\nUnschooling”. At least the ones who confide about the greatest level of<br/>\nhappiness and wonder in their lives have made, and are living, that<br/>\nextension. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
