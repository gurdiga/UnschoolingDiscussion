My sister had to coax me into trying <br/>\nJapanese sushi rolls.  Even though there was nothing raw, I was <br/>\nseriously turned off.  Anyway, she talked me into it and I love them <br/>\nnow.  I could eat those things every day.  But again, I think it <br/>\ncomes down to personality.  There are some people who are more <br/>\n*convincable* than others.  Like I mentioned in a previous post (gih, <br/>\nI am days behind!), my 4yo is completely unconvincable.
