She <br/>\nreceived many good responses but then a few did more harm than good.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Instance<br/>\nI have a friend who is finally going to take her children out of school. Six <br/>\nmonths ago I almost lost this friendship over just Homeschooling <br/>\nconversations. I have been criticized by her for my choice to Unschool.  I <br/>\nhave explained Unschooling more times than I can remember. <br/>\nI have shown her example questions that one may want to know about <br/>\nUnschooling. I talk with her every day.  She says she is going to Unschool <br/>\nbut still says she will buy math and science books.  <br/>\nWeek after week for at least 3 months I have explained it all to her. I have <br/>\nanswered questions. I have printed information for her. I have given her <br/>\nbooks on Unschooling and still &quot;math and science&quot; they will need books <br/>\nbecause she doesn&#39;t know enough about the subjects.<br/>\nIm not giving up on her and im not going to get mad at her. I will repeat it <br/>\nuntil she is ready to hear me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it&#39;s not always that the person isn&#39;t listening or reading right it is <br/>\nwhen they are ready to hear and read what is written. But if those words come <br/>\nout wrong as they do in the case of a child you loose them and have to begin <br/>\nall over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Itsbeenaminute","postDate":"1053318884","msgId":69860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMS4yM2JhYWNjMy4yYmY5YjhlNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69851,"nextInTopic":69867,"prevInTime":69859,"nextInTime":69861,"topicId":69436,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/18/03 9:38:39 PM, HMSL2@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1679016639\">In a message dated 5/18/03 9:38:39 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Im glad she is back all <br/>\nthe talking this weekend should have ended while she was gone and it didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t about her.

Some people felt like they  <br/>\nwere called liars and they got really angry and left. In the meantime,  <br/>\na whole bunch of people took some time to give some deep thought to how  <br/>\ntruthful they really generally were with their kids - we considered  <br/>\ntogether how sometimes we parents can take advantage of kids&#39; innocence  <br/>\nand let them believe something we know is not true, for our own  <br/>\nconvenience or so as not to have to disappoint them or to avoid  <br/>\ndifficult conversations. We talked about what the effect of that might  <br/>\nbe. It was a great discussion and I know for a fact that it had a major  <br/>\nimpact in the lives of a number of people and that includes some who  <br/>\nsigned off in a huff, but came back a year or two later saying, &quot;You  <br/>\nwere right and I was wrong and it was painful but I&#39;m glad you called  <br/>\nit as you saw it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are ALL here to learn - that includes those who give advice and ask  <br/>\nthe tough questions.

PLEASE consider it.  <br/>\nWhen you feel criticized, try just responding with something like: &quot;Oh  <br/>\n- hmmm - I hadn&#39;t looked at it that way, but thanks for giving me a  <br/>\ndifferent perspective.&quot; And then just stop. Think about it privately -  <br/>\nget what you can from it - and let it go.
