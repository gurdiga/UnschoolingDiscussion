IN<br/>\n&gt; THEORY<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you look at it from the child&#39;s point of view, or change it around to a<br/>\nnew sitaution, it becomes clearer why the children don&#39;t see the<br/>\nreasonableness of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults get to choose where to live and pretty much dictate how money gets<br/>\nspent (or at least can veto any purchase). We may think we&#39;re pretty<br/>\ngenerous about kid choices but if we turn it around it is very controlling.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine your husband deciding on his own where you would live, which house<br/>\nto buy (to primarily suit his needs but taking into account any needs of<br/>\nyours that he deemed worthy) and how the decor would look. He would listen<br/>\nto your suggestions but they&#39;d only be taken into consideration if they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t interfere with his needs. Say he&#39;s a big sports fan (and you&#39;re not)<br/>\nand he decided the house would be a shrine to his favorite team.  If you had<br/>\na special non-sports related picture he might suggest it could hang on the<br/>\nrefrigerator or in a corner of your room so it didn&#39;t interfer with his<br/>\ndecorating scheme.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll meals would conform to his idea of good with maybe a little concession<br/>\nto your tastes (potato chips instead of pretzels). You might get to go to<br/>\nyour favorite restaurant once in a while but your order couldn&#39;t be too far<br/>\noff what he thought you should eat and couldn&#39;t be too expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted to buy something outside your regular allowance -- like a book<br/>\nor something -- you&#39;d need to convince him that it was worthy of purchase<br/>\nand you&#39;d need to later demonstrate that you were using it enough for it to<br/>\nhave been worthy of purchase or you&#39;d hear about it the next time you wanted<br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted to go somewhere or get something at the store, it would have o<br/>\nwait until it was convenient for your husband to take you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, ending up in a family is not unlike going to school. There&#39;s no<br/>\nchoice about being born/going to school (at least not for most kids!) or<br/>\nwhat family/school you&#39;ll end up with. The adults are supposedly thinking of<br/>\neverything the kids need and supplying them with it and expecting the kids<br/>\nto appreciate it. The kids don&#39;t, of course, because what the adults are<br/>\nreally supplying is what the *adults* want the kids to have, not what the<br/>\nkids want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may have decided what we wanted for our kids was a big backyard. Then it<br/>\nseems reasonable since the kids live there and should appreciate it, they<br/>\nshould mow it when they&#39;re old enough. But as much as the kids might enjoy<br/>\nthe backyard, they didn&#39;t choose it and knowing what they&#39;d need to do to<br/>\n&quot;pay&quot; for it (for the rest of their childhoods) they might have chosen --<br/>\nhad they been able to be informed and been allowed the choice -- to buy a<br/>\nhouse with a miniscule yard next to a park. So why should they appreciate<br/>\nit?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s sort of like getting showered by nothing but expensive Barbies and<br/>\nparephernalia at every gift giving occasion when you&#39;ve told people that<br/>\nwhat you really love is dinosaurs. Should you think it&#39;s wonderful and<br/>\nappreciate the &quot;thoughtfulness&quot; of the gift givers? Or are the &quot;gifts&quot;<br/>\nreally forms of control?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we act as though our children are partners without demanding that<br/>\nthey act as partners then they will be partners because it&#39;s more joy<br/>\ninspiring to be invited with open arms with no strings attached than it is<br/>\nto be required to uphold your membership in something you never asked to<br/>\njoin.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":27496206,"authorName":"diamond_h2o","from":"&quot;diamond_h2o&quot; &lt;diamond_h2o@...&gt;","profile":"diamond_h2o","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: de-lurking","postDate":"1025214226","msgId":38671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFmZzB1aStkdGUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFmZjI5cithdXRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38662,"nextInTopic":38683,"prevInTime":38670,"nextInTime":38672,"topicId":38662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not from Texas but if i had my choice I would be.
