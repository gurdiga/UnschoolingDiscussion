I unschool because the moment I<br/>\nfound<br/>\n&gt; out that my father had to have brain surgery, Colton was there with me and<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; could pray together.  I unschool because when I battled cancer and<br/>\n&gt; chemotherapy, Colton and I could snuggle together in bed and read living<br/>\n&gt; books, and he would remind me that I had just eleven more treatments to<br/>\ngo.<br/>\n&gt; I unschool because I am head-over-heels in love with this tender soul who<br/>\n&gt; came into my life not quite ten years ago, and I don&#39;t want to miss a<br/>\nminute<br/>\n&gt; of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Blessings,<br/>\n&gt; Carol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; eGroups members: $60 in FREE calls!

This is just cut and pasted from our web site, but it<br/>\ndoes answer the question! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving always been someone who plans ahead, Nancy started thinking about our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s education while still pregnant with our first child. We started<br/>\nwith different perspectives about education. Nancy had lived practically all<br/>\nher life in the same house in Northern Virginia and attended public school<br/>\nwhere she was subjected to an &quot;experimental program of the month&quot; education<br/>\nduring the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s. She remembers starting school as an outgoing child<br/>\nwho enjoyed reading to her classmates, but somewhere along the way becoming<br/>\nmore shy and developing a fear of speaking in public. She did well<br/>\nacademically, but just didn&#39;t enjoy going to school. Some of her strongest<br/>\nmemories include the year that &quot;mainstreaming&quot; put older kids with<br/>\ndevelopmental and behavioral problems in her class and one boy held her by<br/>\nthe wrists over a stairwell and threatened to drop her. She also remembers<br/>\nthe morning she felt sick and wanted to leave, but by the time the teacher<br/>\nfinally acknowledged her raised hand and called her to the front of the<br/>\nroom, it was too late and she threw-up on the teachers desk. Nancy just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t think much of her public school experience!<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly grew up as a Navy brat and attended about a dozen different schools.<br/>\nLike Nancy, he also did well academically, but unlike Nancy, he viewed his<br/>\npublic school experience fairly positively, and wasn&#39;t as inclined to opt<br/>\nfor private school for our children. Besides, he figured we were going to be<br/>\nsuch supportive parents that the actual school environment wasn&#39;t very<br/>\nimportant. Our involvement could supplement any of the shortcomings of the<br/>\nschool. We started out evaluating and visiting lots of private schools and<br/>\npublic schools. As we checked out the public schools, we found they weren&#39;t<br/>\nthe same as when we attended. Classes were larger, students did more poorly,<br/>\nand weapons and drugs were much more commonplace. Billy&#39;s frugal nature<br/>\nrebelled against the idea of stretching our finances to pay thousands of<br/>\ndollars for a private school, but it seemed like our only option and so we<br/>\nvisited several private schools. We liked many of the philosophies and<br/>\napproaches we came across, but we ended up feeling that there were major<br/>\nshortcomings at each school. For us, the perfect program would involve<br/>\ncombining the best ideas from 2 or 3 different schools. We also realized<br/>\nthat most private schools were based on the same model of the public<br/>\nschools, only &quot;more&quot; and &quot;better.&quot; They had more computers, more hands-on<br/>\nactivities, better student/teacher ratios, better discipline, etc. We slowly<br/>\ncame to realize that we didn&#39;t just want a better version of a public school<br/>\neducation, we wanted something completely different.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had heard about homeschooling from various sources and decided we wanted<br/>\nto read more about it. We checked out a handful of books from the public<br/>\nlibrary, including ones written by John Holt and the Colfax&#39;s Homeschooling<br/>\nfor Excellence. Parental involvement and the ability to combine the best<br/>\naspects of several different educational approaches were important to us, so<br/>\nhome education seemed the natural choice. We were even more convinced when a<br/>\ncareful self-evaluation made us realize that our important life skills, the<br/>\nactivities we enjoyed doing for fun or as hobbies, and most of our job<br/>\nskills had all been learned outside of school! By the time our firstborn was<br/>\na year old, we had decided to continue educating him at home. That was in<br/>\n1989, and we haven&#39;t looked back since.<br/>\n<br/>\n(from <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.org/hsfaq.htm\">http://www.unschooling.org/hsfaq.htm</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly<br/>\nFamily Unschoolers Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.org\">http://www.unschooling.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fun@...\">fun@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jaam1224@...\">Jaam1224@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 09, 2000 6:32 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Why I Unschool<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carol,<br/>\n&gt; That is beautiful!
