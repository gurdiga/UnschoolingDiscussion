I&#39;ve avoided posting here because I have too<br/>\nmuch going on, am in too much pain and am too worried and moody to get<br/>\ninto another discussion.  But while I have a minute . . . <br/>\n<br/>\n. . . The good news is, after a long and concerted effort here, Wyndham<br/>\nis finally learning to police his own TV watching.  He has finally taken<br/>\nsome control for himself and it is great.  We still have to monitor a<br/>\nlittle bit and force the issue occassionally, but those times are<br/>\nbecoming fewer and far between.  What do I think changed things?  One<br/>\nreason is a friend who does not watch much TV at all.  He saw by example<br/>\nhow much stuff there is to do. And Two, the constant control by his<br/>\nguardians allowed him to see that he could do all that stuff at home too.<br/>\n We didn&#39;t limit TV a lot.  In fact I think he probably watches more than<br/>\nanyone else in the family still, but he does get away from it on his own<br/>\noccassionally too.  So there are signs of hope, hope that he will get the<br/>\nobsession under control himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n. . . We are walking talking evidence that everyone does not respond to<br/>\nthe same things in the same ways.  My girls have never had nor needed to<br/>\nhave their TV limited.  In 6 1/2 years, we&#39;ve no organized schoolwork - I<br/>\njust gave them books and workbooks and took them places (Museums and<br/>\nscience centers are not &quot;schoolwork&quot; they are somethig we all do for<br/>\nfun.)   This year for the first time we have set up some real structure<br/>\nto the family jobs and they did ask for some changes to it and got them. <br/>\nSorry, I drifted there.  Anyway, they are now taking a chem class with a<br/>\ngroup of homeschoolers (yes they wanted too) and they are doing just as<br/>\nwell as the others who have had much more structure through the years.<br/>\n<br/>\n. . . Tara, the only encouragement I can offer is to tell you to trust<br/>\nyour own feelings.  If you think your child needs help turning of the<br/>\ntube, then give it.  Don&#39;t get upset and yell even if you are being<br/>\nyelled at, don&#39;t lie about it - but disconnect it if you have to and most<br/>\nimportantly, be consistent and upfront about it.  Figure out what he<br/>\nWANTS to watch and make sure he gets to see those shows.  A big part of<br/>\nthe problem with Wyndham was that he didn&#39;t know when his shows were<br/>\ngoing to be on, so now we go through the guide and show him and promise<br/>\nto remind him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 9 Nov 2001 09:01:32 -0800<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Deschooling-video games<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading this thread and kept my mouth shut but there seems <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to be a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; very big misconception.
