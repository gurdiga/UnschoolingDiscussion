She is careful, detail-oriented, and very excited<br/>\nabout being entrusted with such an important job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still check her work, but visualize the time in the not too distant future<br/>\nwhen she will be able to do it all on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDecades ago when families had fewer material conveniences, less<br/>\ndiscretionary income, and many more household tasks, it was possibly easier<br/>\nto find real work for the children to do. Milking cows, mowing lawns,<br/>\nchurning butter, feeding animals, emptying chamber pots, mending fences--the<br/>\nlist went on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd perhaps those children knew their effort was needed; that everyone in<br/>\nthe family depended on them. There was nothing &quot;make-workish&quot; about it. Not<br/>\nsurprisingly, many of them grew up with a solid work ethic, and became<br/>\nself-reliant adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren intuitively know when we give them important work. They often<br/>\nrespond positively to a gift of trust. They want to be involved in our<br/>\nworld; to do the jobs grown-ups do. We just have to spend the time to train<br/>\nthem, and then give them some real work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, many parents struggle with trying to instill in their children a<br/>\ngood work ethic. They enroll their children in all manner of camps, classes,<br/>\nand sports teams. They buy them the clothes, the toys, the cars, the college<br/>\ntuition--everything they&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to have to fit in, and become<br/>\n&quot;successful&quot; adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet if children don&#39;t learn to work when they&#39;re young, to be meticulous, to<br/>\ncare, and to be reliable, will all of the purchased advantages still ensure<br/>\nthey become true successes in life?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have my doubts.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly, it makes a lot of sense to give children big responsibility<br/>\nearly; to let them know the family truly depends on their efforts.<br/>\nBequeathing them such a gift may, in the long run, prove to be far more<br/>\nsignificant than all of the material support we might shower them with over<br/>\nthe years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the short run, at least in the Andersen family, now that Heidi is<br/>\nlearning the books, I get more time for surfing the Net.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--John Andersen<br/>\nUnconventional Ideas at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unconventionalideas.com\">http://www.unconventionalideas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"John O.
