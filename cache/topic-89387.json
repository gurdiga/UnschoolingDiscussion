When the opportunity came to drive across Canada and  work out west for 6 months we were pulled with what seemed to be very little thought...Two years in a row.

But they did lay that foundation more then most I think. <br/>\n    All in all, I have never been so content and satisfied and open to the world in my adult life as I am now.

I had always known that the system had a LOT of bugs in it, but we still went through the motions and sent the kids to school because that&#39;s what responsible parents are &#39;supposed&#39; to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started going to Zack&#39;s staffings at school, the whole ridiculous notion of school slapped me square in the face, and I stepped back and was finally able to really see what was going on.  That&#39;s when I knew there had to be a better way.  I had no idea what it was, but ANYTHING was going to be better than what was happening to Zack at that school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose that&#39;s why it was easier for me to make the transition from school to unschooling than some other people I&#39;ve met or read about.  I KNOW, first hand, that school doesn&#39;t work.  My son is proof.  By the time I pulled him out of school, our staff meetings had sunk to new lows, and one teacher flat out LIED to me!  I had proof of her lie right in my hand, and she still wouldn&#39;t admit it.  It was time to go.  Our last staffing was nothing more than a screaming match, and it was the last time we ever set foot inside the building.  Then we discovered unschooling, and our lives were forever changed.  It still wasn&#39;t an &#39;easy&#39; transition, but our experience with school definitely helped me along.<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLyle<br/>\n<br/>\n***Always remember, Lead By Example***<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n___________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\">http://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6770123,"authorName":"BonKnit@aol.com","from":"BonKnit@...","profile":"pampmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling thoughts","postDate":"1074536734","msgId":89414,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMy4xNDE0MjYxMS4yZDNkN2IxZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89412,"nextInTopic":89419,"prevInTime":89413,"nextInTime":89415,"topicId":89387,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/19/2004 12:13:04 PM Central Standard Time, ...

I&#39;m still learning a lot from this list and seeing the ways I can let go in other areas and allow that freedom and joy to spill over into everything that we do as a family. Dh is getting it, too, maybe more quickly than most and slower than some, but he&#39;s working on it in his own way. He&#39;s always willing to discuss issues, and even when he&#39;s being pretty traditional-minded, he usually sees my point after a little while. &lt;eg&gt; But both of us have practiced attachment parenting, co-sleeping and have always involved the children in our lives. When I used to teach college courses, dh took the kids into his lab, carried them in the front carrier, incorporating them into his life. That certainly helps him make the leap as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling thoughts","postDate":"1074533720","msgId":89408,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM2LjI3MzYyNWIzLjJkM2Q2ZjU4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89400,"nextInTopic":89410,"prevInTime":89407,"nextInTime":89409,"topicId":89387,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/19/2004 10:07:05 AM Mountain Standard Time, BonKnit@aol.com writes: -=-Is there harm in being able to see the learning? -=- ==== There s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1600431174\">In a message dated 1/19/2004 10:07:05 AM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BonKnit@...\">BonKnit@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-Is there harm in being able to &quot;see&quot; the learning? -=-<br/>\n====<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s harm in NOT being able to see it, and there&#39;s even more harm in not <br/>\n&quot;seeing learning&quot; until it looks like school-style busywork.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think  there&#39;s harm in telling children &quot;NOW you&#39;re learning!&quot;  or &quot;OH <br/>\nGOOD!

I have talked to people concerning unschooling and they have <br/>\nreplied &quot;Oh yeah, we tried that and relaxed hsing and...&quot; Now these people had <br/>\nonly been hsing about a year so I really had to wonder, I mean I just don&#39;t think <br/>\nyou can get the concept that fast, especially when you also say you have <br/>\ntried several other styles in a short period of time too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I am just slower than most but it took me a long time to get to this <br/>\npoint. Do you think people can get the concept overnight? I think you can start <br/>\nout not using any curriculum but to me that is not the whole of it, it reaches <br/>\nfar deeper IMHO than just not using a math book. (And of course that is <br/>\noptional to the person wanting to learn)<br/>\n<br/>\nI even knew I was on the path, I knew we were headed this way and even last <br/>\nyear I knew I wasn&#39;t totally here.

I even remember knowing I wanted to <br/>\nmake the switch, I knew I was ready, I even worked at pushing through not <br/>\nknowing exactly what I was pushing through but it worked or something worked <br/>\nbecause I know I changed, my perspective changed. I can&#39;t describe how thrilling it <br/>\nis, also a relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid anyone else share a similar experience? Does this sound wacky?
