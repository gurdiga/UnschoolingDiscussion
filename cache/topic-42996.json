I do take him everywhere with me, <br/>\nand he expects it, too.  I also donate blood every eight weeks, and he <br/>\ncomes along.  He&#39;s pretty jaded to it now, but he can see that it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhurt, and he asks all kinds of questions about it and they always give him <br/>\na roll of that weird colored bandage.  He&#39;s had blood drawn twice because <br/>\nof Lyme disease (positive both times), but he&#39;s been GREAT about it.  He <br/>\neven watches when they do it!  He looks forward to a few rides on the <br/>\nelevator when we&#39;re done and then we go do something fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means a lot to him that I donate blood for other people we don&#39;t know <br/>\nwho might need it.  Sometimes (when he&#39;s tired) he gets a little upset and <br/>\nwants me to keep my blood for me.  He&#39;s worried they&#39;ll take it all, I <br/>\nguess.  But, I&#39;m glad that there is this concrete thing that he can see me <br/>\ndo to help other people.

There are 38 kids on <br/>\nour block, split in half between public and private schools.  We are the only <br/>\nhomeschooling family.  They are thrilled to have their older kids in school <br/>\nand can&#39;t wait for the younger ones to grow up and go to school (one poor <br/>\nalmost 4 year old is in his THIRD year of preschool).  Most moms of little <br/>\nones put them in a &quot;mom&#39;s day out&quot; program at a local church a day or two.  I <br/>\nhad to use it the other day for a doctor&#39;s appointment (all the kids being <br/>\nback in school cuts out the babysitters) and am wondering how long I&#39;ll have <br/>\nto work to undo things.  They had the hands in the lap thing and the <br/>\nscheduled snack thing.
