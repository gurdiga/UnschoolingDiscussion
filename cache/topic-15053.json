The only problem I <br/>\nhave with the show is that Liza is often dishonest with her parents. They <br/>\nwill tell her to stay in camp, for her own safety, and she says she will but <br/>\nleaves the minute after her parents leave. Her word is like worthless.  Of <br/>\ncourse there is always a good reason, she will be trying to save an animal or <br/>\nsomething, and usually about gets herself killed. Or she tells her Mom, while <br/>\ncamping, that she is going to bed and instead sneaks off. We still watch the <br/>\nshow and we like it but we do discuss why it would be a bad idea to behave <br/>\nthis way and we all agree here that is a failing in the show. <br/>\npeace and grace<br/>\nCandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15050,"nextTopicId":15054}}
