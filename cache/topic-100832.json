The DVD&#39;s have, of course, hours of extras. It <br/>\nwas $60 and my friend was surprised I&#39;d spend that on such a thing. <br/>\nWould somebody hesitate to pay that for an advanced astronomy series  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr for a one-day workshop on musical theatre!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and I have listened to and discussed The Beatles on our last two road <br/>\ntrips.  This last weekend, though the trip itself had to do with 19th century <br/>\nsettlements and boom towns, the drive itself was about what makes really good <br/>\nrock&#39;n&#39;roll singing (Meatloaf on Bat Out of Hell, some pretty deep analysis of <br/>\ntone and phrasing), what makes &quot;sexy&quot;  (Meatloaf and Prince as odd but <br/>\ndefinite examples, and Marty making jokes about what he would tell his kids someday <br/>\nif they&#39;re rediscovering late 20th century rock and he says that Meatloaf was a <br/>\nmovie star and a great and sexy singer, and they might question his <br/>\njudgment), and some discussion on the path from swing music to rockabilly.  (We had <br/>\ndiscussed the whole &quot;Negro-music&quot; and Black-labels business and John Lennon&#39;s <br/>\nfascination with that style on the way to see Civil War battlesites earlier in <br/>\nthe month.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSO anyway, this morning I find this e-mail:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I hope you either saw or will soon see the special on PBS about John <br/>\nLennon&#39;s<br/>\nJukebox.  It&#39;s outstanding.  Interviews with many of the musicians that John<br/>\ngrew up listening to.<br/>\n<br/>\nCB-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I responded, before reading Pam&#39;s note above:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t see it and didn&#39;t know about it.<br/>\nThanks for letting me know!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and I have gone on two road trips and mostly listened to old Beatles.  <br/>\nThe fith birthday, and we heard a couple of radio tribute shows.   Then just <br/>\nthe past three days we went to Lordsburg and Silver City and thereabout, and <br/>\nlistened to CDs and the names &quot;Carl Perkins,&quot; &quot;Little Richard&quot; and &quot;Chubby <br/>\nChecker&quot; were mentioned aloud. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it being a PBS thing the DVD might be really expensive,but it might <br/>\nbe worth it, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe saw ghost towns.  Stein&#39;s and Shakespeare.   Parts of other towns that are <br/>\nghostly. &lt;g&gt;  Hillsboro.  Pinos Altos.  Talked to people everywhere, heard <br/>\nstories, went into little museums that were more like &quot;go ahead and pick it up&quot; <br/>\nplaces full of dusty 1890&#39;s junk.  It was great.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100825,"nextTopicId":100822}}
