I was one who didnt<br/>\nwant the darn things in my house. In my mind I had it they would rot my<br/>\nkids brains and they would become lazy and not want to do anything but<br/>\nplay them. Hey I am big enough to admit I felt the same way about Legos.<br/>\nI know what was I thinking? Still deschooling I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nWalk into my house now you will find my son (9) not only has a gameboy<br/>\nbut a subscription to some game magazine. We also picked up an old Sega<br/>\ngenisis (ok so we aren&#39;t hip but so far no complaints). Why the change?<br/>\nMy dh bought Nate one and I put the rule he had to get x amount of work<br/>\ndone around the house before game time. Well then I noticed the kid who<br/>\nhated to read was reading the manual. Nate swore up and down he couldnt<br/>\nread. But there he was sitting on the couch reading. We went up  to a<br/>\nused game store and picked up more games with his allowence and he got a<br/>\nmembership that came with a magazine subscription to I believe it is The<br/>\nGame Informer (or something like that). I don&#39;t really know as soon as<br/>\nit hits the mail box Nate grabs it and runs to his room and reads it.<br/>\nAgain this is my son who didn&#39;t want to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to say this since someone else posted they worried their kid would<br/>\nplay nintendo all day. My son has gone from not reading at all to<br/>\nreading chapter books and actually enjoying a trip to the library<br/>\nbecause I let a gameboy in the house. Who knew. *L*<br/>\n<br/>\nSo never under estimate the learning power of something even if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t see it. This is what I am finding out as we take this unschooling<br/>\njourney.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelly<br/>\nmom to 5<br/>\nConnecticut</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15000,"nextTopicId":15008}}
