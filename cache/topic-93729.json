Pinckney, a Charleston native and Citadel graduate who publishes <br/>\nThe Baptist Banner in Alexandria, Va., submitted the controversial <br/>\nresolution for next month&#39;s annual meeting in Indianapolis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe resolution says Christian parents should put their children in <br/>\nChristian schools or teach them at home because public schools <br/>\nare &quot;anti-Christian,&quot; &quot;humanistic&quot; and &quot;officially Godless,&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;many Christian children in government schools are converted to <br/>\nan anti-Christian worldview rather than evangelizing their <br/>\nschoolmates.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe resolution has been widely circulated through e-mail. Pinckney, a <br/>\nformer second vice president of the convention and one of the leaders <br/>\nin the denomination&#39;s conservative takeover in the 1970s and &#39;80s, <br/>\nconfirmed the resolution&#39;s authenticity in a telephone interview <br/>\nFriday.<br/>\n<br/>\nA committee appointed by President Jack Graham will decide whether to <br/>\nrelease it for debate on the floor, said John Revell, executive <br/>\ncommittee staff liaison to the resolutions committee. The convention <br/>\nnever comments on resolutions in advance, he said in an interview, <br/>\nwhich he followed up with a statement by e-mail.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Southern Baptist Convention has more than 43,000 churches with <br/>\nmore than 16.3 million members,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Any -- or all --<br/>\nof those members could hypothetically submit a proposed resolution <br/>\non any subject matter they choose. The resolutions committee <br/>\nprayerfully and carefully evaluates each proposal to determine if it <br/>\nis suitable for submission to the Southern Baptist Convention.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1999, messengers passed a resolution urging churches to support <br/>\nChristian educational programs &quot;whether they are implemented in <br/>\nChristian, private, public, or home schools.&quot; In 1997, they passed a <br/>\nresolution supporting parents who teach their children at home and <br/>\nChristians who teach in public schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the committee does not release the resolution for debate, Pinckney <br/>\nsaid he will make a motion from the floor after the convention opens <br/>\nJune 15. Two-thirds of the messengers would have to approve for the <br/>\nresolution to stay alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe resolution was co-sponsored by Bruce Shortt of Houston, a former <br/>\nattorney who is active in the home-school movement through the Exodus <br/>\nMandate, which is based in Columbia.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortt has spearheaded the unusual preconvention publicity.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;As Christians, we have to take a serious look at this,&quot; he <br/>\nsaid. &quot;Government schools are a seething cauldron of educational <br/>\npathologies. Most parents have no idea how bad the government schools <br/>\nare and how toxic that is for children. Christian children who attend <br/>\npublic schools are being enticed out of the church.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExodus Mandate founder Ray Moore Jr. of Columbia, also a Charleston <br/>\nnative and Citadel graduate, said he made some suggestions while the <br/>\nresolution was being drafted. He&#39;s not a Southern Baptist but <br/>\nwelcomes the discussion the resolution has generated.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Even in South Carolina, the school system is officially anti-<br/>\nChristian and godless,&quot; said Moore, whose four children were schooled <br/>\nat home. &quot;Anything goes but Christianity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPinckney grew up attending Citadel Square Baptist Church in downtown <br/>\nCharleston, which operated a Christian school until the mid-1980s. <br/>\nPastor Ken Hardin declined to comment on the resolution, saying he <br/>\nhad not had time to read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhone calls to several local Baptist school administrators Friday <br/>\nafternoon were not returned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDave Munday can be reached at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dmunday@...\">dmunday@...</a> or 937-5720. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1278341,"authorName":"Ann and Eric Yates","from":"&quot;Ann and Eric Yates&quot; &lt;hooperck@...&gt;","profile":"mumsienc2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] UNINFORMED biased article","postDate":"1084232011","msgId":93786,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDMwMWM0MzZlNyQzNjY4Y2U0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBtb20+","referencesHeader":"PDFkYi4yMTExMWRmMy4yZGQxNmE4ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":93783,"nextInTopic":93804,"prevInTime":93785,"nextInTime":93787,"topicId":93729,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The NC group is actually having a spanking advocate at their upcoming conference!
