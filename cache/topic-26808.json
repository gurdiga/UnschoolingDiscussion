I would really like to get into this. I love books and I&#39;ve been looking for a way to make some money but stay home with my kids. What kind of places do you go to find books? Do you have your own web site? Do you sell from your house at all, like a store front? How do you know what a book is worth? Is there a good book about this that I should have to help with pricing. Thanks for your help!!!  You may have saved me from having to give up on unschooling for a while!!!! You can e-mail me privately if you want. I don&#39;t want you to waste time on me but if there&#39;s a bit of advice that you could share that is a must know etc...I would appreciate it sooooo much!!!<br/>\nThanks for everything and anything,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leslie@...\">leslie@...</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pam Hartley <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 7:05 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1528<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n  &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1528<br/>\n  &gt;Date: Sun, Oct 7, 2001, 6:14 AM<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Hi Pam,<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m wondering what kind of book store you have in your home.
