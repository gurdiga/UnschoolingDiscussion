I got married a couple of years ago on a <br/>\nbaseball field in the middle of January in Louisiana, notorious for lots of <br/>\nrain in the winter.   Each &quot;side&quot; had 9 player/attendants. My daughter sang <br/>\nthe National Anthem to start us out, which was followed by 9 innings, each of <br/>\nwhich was a poem or song, followed by the vows which we each had written our <br/>\nown. Then my husband turned to my 9 year daughter old with rhyming vows he <br/>\nhad written for her and a ring as well. Not a dry eye in the stadium!! <br/>\n<br/>\nIn case anyone is wondering why a baseball field, my husband worked in minor <br/>\nleague baseball and is a fanatic and it had always been his dream to get <br/>\nmarried at home plate. . . I thought why not  make his dream come true. . . <br/>\nmy preference would have been a garden, but this was a lifelong dream of his. <br/>\n. . people were very very skeptical about it. . . all my attendants thought I <br/>\nwas nuts, but after it was over, everyone told me it was the most unique and <br/>\nbest wedding they had ever attended.  I have to say it was the best one I <br/>\nattended as well. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Juli","from":"Juli &lt;yuliwomie@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"oUpssGPgOOEPf9tnTeY2wjd06vRYX630CfqmAiYZIMJeabGuYoD3fcESpvYbwB8CdAGfJgYJ-SQDTZm89GVvyFI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Honeymoons and all that jazz...","postDate":"988299415","msgId":19820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNDI2MTUzNjU1LjU4MzcxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMjAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwLmRkNTFmODMuMjgxOTA5Y2NAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":19811,"nextInTopic":19832,"prevInTime":19819,"nextInTime":19821,"topicId":19730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A potluck wedding. :) It was a beautiful day and<br/>\neveryone was happy to be outside.

It was beautiful. When I saw Forrest Gump, I was surprised to see almost my own wedding. We had lots of fresh flowers twined around an arch with tissuepaper streamers too. We each personalized our vows and shared what we loved about each other. I asked guests to share what they thought the most important thing to make a marriage last was. Makes a great scrapbook. We only got one night alone at a friends house (with cozy fireplace) for our honeymoon and just enjoyed being together alone. Do you like nature, maybe you could find a cabin in the woods thing? Or maybe a few days in the big city if thats more your style.<br/>\nJohanna <br/>\nLife is the ultimate learning experience!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Bobbie <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 25, 2001 11:26 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Honeymoons and all that jazz...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Speaking of which.

We want  a June wedding and don&#39;t want to wait<br/>\ntil next year. <br/>\nAnyway, Honeymoons. Trying to decide what to do for<br/>\none. I have the two kids that my fam will watch, but<br/>\nwho knows how long I can go without them!<br/>\nSeperation anxiety. :)<br/>\nAny ideas for a nice semi-short honeymoon?<br/>\nAlso, any ideas for any eccentric or cheapy touches to<br/>\nthe wedding will be appreciated. It will be the<br/>\nfarthest from &quot;traditional&quot; weddings. <br/>\nWith this diverse group, I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll hear some<br/>\nthings I haven&#39;t already or some new twists.<br/>\nThanks in advance! :)<br/>\n-Bobbie the Bride-To-Be<br/>\n(tee hee)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Tracy Oldfield &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Reminds me of me and dh looking for the cottage t<br/>\n&gt; spend <br/>\n&gt; our honeymoon in, decided it needed to be just-right<br/>\n&gt; so <br/>\n&gt; we went and toured round the area for a day, saw 23 <br/>\n&gt; cottages!

I could see the precariously balanced stuffed animals shake and shimmy with the thundering children!  And the parents that volunteered to come along on this field trip had no control over the kids at all!  They were screaming at the kids to no avail!  How can anyone learn anything in that chaos?
