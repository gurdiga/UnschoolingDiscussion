Who says you have to spend time with her?  If you weren&#39;t related by blood, is she someone you would choose to spend time with?  If she weren&#39;t realted to you, is she someone you would leave your children with?  Personally, I avoid people who are out to &quot;fix&quot; me or my children.  Maybe it&#39;s just that I know that my own self-esteem can&#39;t handle too many of these little attacks--those moments when someone questions how I am doing things.   And I know that I am parenting in a completely different way than me or my husband were raised.  Maybe I&#39;m just trying to limit their influence by spending less and less time with them.

When she proudly showed them to my<br/>\nparents they said in unison &quot;Oh, are you taking tap dancing class?&quot;  We<br/>\nall shook our head no and I saw my mom struggle for a second but she had<br/>\nto lecture me about letting her have tap shoes without lessons.  I said<br/>\n&quot;why would you squash the joy out of wearing a pair of tap shoes?&quot;  She<br/>\nsaid it wasn&#39;t the way it was done.  We discussed this again at a later<br/>\ntime and she said that children aren&#39;t taught anymore that achievement<br/>\ncomes only through hard work.  I asked what that had to do with a pair<br/>\nof tap shoes.  She said we were never going to see eye to eye and that<br/>\nwas the end of it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI used to try to defend my position to my parents (especially since I<br/>\ntold them I was not going to do school-at-home and they told me I had no<br/>\nright to experiment on my children - but that&#39;s another on-going<br/>\ndiscussion).  I don&#39;t think I ever really understood that my parent&#39;s<br/>\nview of life and children in general is that there are rules attached to<br/>\neverything.  If you want to have a camera you better become a<br/>\nworld-renowned photographer.  If you want tap shoes you better take<br/>\nclasses or you have no right to wear them.  I&#39;m not sure where this rule<br/>\nstructure came from, whether most people from their generation (the 50&#39;s<br/>\nand 60&#39;s) have the same belief system or not.  I do see that it takes<br/>\nthe joy out of life and learning.  Unschooling to them means letting a<br/>\nchild rule the house.  Seen and not heard are what they believe in.   <br/>\n <br/>\nWe went to dinner at their house and they expected my children to sit<br/>\nstill and eat until everyone was done.  That&#39;s not what I expect at my<br/>\nown house because if my dh and I want to talk, we&#39;ll sit there for<br/>\nawhile.  Same at my parents.  There&#39;s always some long-winded discussion<br/>\ngoing at dinner, this day was no different.  When my children finished<br/>\nthey wanted to get up (especially my 2yo).  I said I didn&#39;t feel the<br/>\nnecessity to make them sit through a discussion that they are not<br/>\n&quot;allowed&quot; to participate in because they will be chastised for<br/>\n&quot;interrupting&quot; when they had eaten and were done.   My 2 yo is sitting<br/>\nthere crying because my mother was making her sit by not letting her get<br/>\ndown and giving me a hard time because she wanted to sit in my lap.  I<br/>\nsnapped and asked why she had to be such a tyrant at the dinner table.<br/>\nGranted, it wasn&#39;t a nice thing to say to my mom, but it was the only<br/>\nword that fit.  I don&#39;t want to be a dictator in my house and make my<br/>\nkids do things just because I was told they should be done that way.  My<br/>\n5 yo got up to go to the bathroom - I didn&#39;t notice but my mom did - who<br/>\nnotices stuff like that and puts a black mark in their mental book?<br/>\nSomeone who thinks children are here to obey and by doing so become good<br/>\nadults.  Isn&#39;t that the same as what  Deb&#39;s mom said about going to<br/>\npreschool to learn to respect adults?  Is respect learned by blindly<br/>\nobeying?  Or is it from being shown from the beginning that you are a<br/>\nperson with feelings and thoughts as much as anyone else around you.<br/>\nRespect is learned by having your feelings and thoughts respected, too.<br/>\nNot saying kids don&#39;t say &quot;disrespectful&quot; things but helping them to<br/>\nrealize that they have hurt someone else&#39;s feelings is how children<br/>\nlearn to respect others.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThis got very long .
