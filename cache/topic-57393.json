And we dash between there, Indiana <br/>\n(Lawrenceburg) for skiing, Oxford (Miami University) for theatre and <br/>\nworkshops and lots of sports, Dayton (tons more great stuff to see <br/>\nand do!), Newport (Kentucky, on the Ohio River front, with its new <br/>\nbig Aquarium that has a great teen volunteer program and lots of <br/>\ndevelopment going on), Covington (also in KY with parks and museums <br/>\nand great cheap art classes for home educators at the Baker Hunt <br/>\nFoundation). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn northern Cincinnati Dd volunteers in an historical village, <br/>\nstudies dance and movement, piano, and trains for figure skating <br/>\ndaily.  Both Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky are training up some of <br/>\nthe top up and coming figure skaters in the country.  With a fine <br/>\nfencing school and every imaginable kind of martial arts training <br/>\ncenter, as well as its Olympic gymnastics training facilities, <br/>\nseveral good climbing gyms, and all kinds of other physical fun <br/>\nopportunities from unicycle training to horseback riding, period <br/>\ndance troups, and more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDd attends lots of great teen activities and events at our branch <br/>\nlibrary (teen drama club, chess club, writing club, knitting club, <br/>\nbook club), and others in the large downtown library facility, too.  <br/>\nKnown for its hills and beautiful parks Cincinnati provides a great <br/>\nvariety of volunteer opportunities and tons of nature related events <br/>\nand activities, some especially for home educators.   Not to mention <br/>\nthe symphony, the ballet, lots and lots of theatre, jazz, concerts of <br/>\nall kinds, art galleries galore.  We often go to great free concerts <br/>\nor free theatre presentations where only a handful of people show <br/>\nup!  Go figure.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCincinnati has a whole bunch of colleges and universities, too, with <br/>\nall the great freebie learning and cultural opportunities that they <br/>\noften sponsor.  The new architecturally acclaimed Contemporary Art <br/>\nCenter downtown, the Taft Museum (currently undergoing renovation), <br/>\nand the soon to open National Underground Railroad Museum will add <br/>\neven more options for those who live in this area.  And we also enjoy <br/>\na very active and diverse home education community with lots of <br/>\ndifferent home ed support groups, something for everyone.  Okay, <br/>\nthat&#39;s it for my Cincinnati spiel.  With all its other problems we <br/>\nhave thoroughly enjoyed mining its unschooling riches!  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122926724,"authorName":"Rachel Ann","from":"Rachel  Ann &lt;hindar@...&gt;","profile":"salixj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Digest Number 2971","postDate":"1044034791","msgId":57418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFM0FCNEU3LjAwMDAwMS4wMTMzNkBBbm9saWNrRmFtaWx5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGIxZWFsaCtyNWg2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57410,"nextInTopic":57425,"prevInTime":57417,"nextInTime":57419,"topicId":57393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Having been born and raised in Cincinnati, you are so right!
