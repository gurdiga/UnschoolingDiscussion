The United Fruit Company bought up<br/>\nthe land and paid the local workers a pittance to send fancy fruit to<br/>\nAmerica.  (Very similar to what is happening with the oil companies in<br/>\nChiapas, Mexico which also encited an armed uprising.)  Kids were working in<br/>\na state of malnutrition so we could eat delicacies.

Our government initially was<br/>\ninterested in backing Castor because they thought he would win anyway, but<br/>\nas soon as they found out he wouldn&#39;t play ball with them, our government<br/>\nportrayed him as the devil.  Cuba currently has better medical care and a<br/>\nbetter literacy rate than us and Castor&#39;s approval rating is higher than<br/>\neither Bush&#39;s or Clifton&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaste La Victoria, Simper!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--who think Bridget is probably off the hook now.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Wendy Silver","from":"&quot;Wendy Silver&quot; &lt;wew99@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"tW3XyB40PVsbjInXRJy8RUEZ70yjJ7I0yWYHMssps5N1X03n9s64eEyOr7gjuDgl4WdwaQF_K9GzSozO2ezFaZLNZ2uj4kft","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1466","postDate":"1000351256","msgId":25522,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzAwMWMxM2MwMyQxYTJlNjBhMCQyYzBkOGMxOEBzc3NuZXQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDAzNDk2ODguMjY4MC45MjI5MS5sN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25540,"prevInTime":25521,"nextInTime":25523,"topicId":25522,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"BTW, you are aware that there is medication for delusional behavior and paranoia.
