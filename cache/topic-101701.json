I&#39;d like to know if there are any Florida-based or other <br/>\n(vacationing/visiting) unschoolers out there who would be interested <br/>\nin a workshop of this type or know of any other groups or area <br/>\nevents that would be potential contacts for making this happen on <br/>\nthe East coast, either this year or next.  <br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for information on the upcoming LIFE Fest, if<br/>\navailable. Specifically, I would to suggest Inbal Kashtan,<br/>\nParenting Project Coordinator of the Center for Nonviolent<br/>\nCommunication (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnvc.org/parents.htm,)\">http://www.cnvc.org/parents.htm,)</a> as a future guest<br/>\nspeaker. It would be helpful to know if any other homeschool<br/>\nconventions are usually held around the same time, in order to<br/>\ndetermine the potential for Ms. Kashtan to participate in more than<br/>\none event when her itinerary is open for a visit to the East coast.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate a response from any and all interested parties in<br/>\nthe next day or two, if possible, but understand if the holiday rush<br/>\nprecludes that possibility for many of the subscribers to the list.<br/>\nThanks for providing a forum to allow us to network together, share<br/>\nresources, and explore the possibilities!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Holidays, Amigos ~<br/>\nPenne & the Crew<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Tis the Season for Giving from the Heart<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kitchencrew.ardfamilyco-op.net\">http://kitchencrew.ardfamilyco-op.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What I want in my life is compassion, a flow between myself and <br/>\nothers based on a mutual giving from the heart.&quot;<br/>\nÂ—Marshall B.
