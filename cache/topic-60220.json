How it relates to my attempt at an unschooling <br/>\nlife: if my daughter wants to get up and cook something, I am more likely to <br/>\nrelax and just let her if there is a clean counter to cook on. She almost <br/>\ncaught a notebook on fire once. I may not be as laid back as some of the <br/>\nseasoned unschoolers here, but I am a lot more relaxed than I was before. I <br/>\nam a perfectionist and I just want to help others like myself with common <br/>\ngoals or similar suffering.  I come here to contribute, not argue. Also to <br/>\nlearn and grow.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, maybe it&#39;s the way I come across, but <br/>\nwhen I make a different choice for my family, I often get the &quot;are you saying <br/>\nthe way I do it isn&#39;t good enough?&quot; defense. ESPECIALLY among fellow parents. <br/>\nMy choice to homeschool implies schooling families are inferior, my choice to <br/>\nbreastfeed implies formula is inferior, it goes on and on.  Can&#39;t someone do <br/>\nsomething that is best for them without apologizing for making others feel <br/>\ndefensive? I will never assert my way is the best way or the only way. I <br/>\nhonestly appreciate when someone can honestly tell me if I come across <br/>\noffensive without taking it personally. I am eager to learn to communicate <br/>\nmore effectively, and am open to suggestions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\nUnschooling mom to<br/>\nMegan(10) Ashlyn(3) Christian(1.5) <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;UNO Unschoolers Network of Ohio&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;\">http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Links Page MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Routines and Balance","postDate":"1046974414","msgId":60233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOS4yNGMxMzE2Mi4yYjk4ZTljZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60224,"nextInTopic":60249,"prevInTime":60232,"nextInTime":60234,"topicId":60220,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/6/03 8:33:21 AM, unolist@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1480555541\">In a message dated 3/6/03 8:33:21 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unolist@...\">unolist@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; They are designed to get you <br/>\ninto a habit then you need to unsub and do it yourself, no excuses.

I learned a lot about getting on a consistent routine, and I would <br/>\n&gt;be lying if I said it didn&#39;t make me nicer to be around. I could make <br/>\n&gt;excuses all day long of why it&#39;s okay to live in a chaotic cluttered <br/>\n&gt;&quot;creative&quot; house. The plain truth is our family does not thrive in such an <br/>\n&gt;environment. It is very frustrating when you &quot;forget&quot; about an interesting <br/>\n&gt;book or project because it gets lost in a mess. And if mom aint <br/>\n&gt;happy.......I took the best parts of Flylady and discarded the rest. I <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t think it&#39;s effective being on the computer all the time receiving <br/>\n&gt;emails and reminders. I know myself to know if I am on the computer too <br/>\n&gt;much, I am not available to my kids the way I should be. There was a link <br/>\n&gt;to the message board about spending more time being with your kids, and <br/>\n&gt;being on the computer too much is the biggest saboteur. Ironic, isn&#39;t it? <br/>\n&gt;Now I remember why I stopped staying caught up on these email lists. If I <br/>\n&gt;really have to choose between spending time on the computer and having an <br/>\n&gt;organized house, the computer would be the first to go. Most of the time I <br/>\n&gt;can find a suitable balance, but I am not going to delude myself that it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;okay to have a crazy stressed house that leads to a crazy stressed mom. I <br/>\n&gt;do not have the capacity to relax in the midst of mess and pretend it <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t exist. I am a better mom and more available physically and <br/>\n&gt;emotionally to my kids when I take care of myself and my house. I do not <br/>\n&gt;nag the kids to help me. Flylady teaches not to be a martyr about cleaning, <br/>\n&gt;not to be resentful that no one helps out. I get the house on a consistent <br/>\n&gt;routine because it feels good to take care of the people I love, and that <br/>\n&gt;brings more results in them helping out than ordering and nagging. They <br/>\n&gt;appreciate calmness and order and start to cultivate it for themselves. And <br/>\n&gt;they spend time with me helping each other instead of hiding or avoiding <br/>\n&gt;what needs to be done. I agree with the poster that said some things just <br/>\n&gt;need to be done.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now I don&#39;t expect everyone to agree with me but it may be worth some <br/>\n&gt;consideration especially if it evokes defensiveness to what I am comm <br/>\n&gt;unicating. Here is what I have gotten from Flylady and adapted, so here it <br/>\n&gt;is without having to subscribe to emails and reminders and so forth:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Make a morning routine and evening routine ON PAPER, and do it. Spend <br/>\n&gt;however many minutes in the morning and in the evening, and it prevents <br/>\n&gt;things from building up, including panic and resentment. Keep your Paper <br/>\n&gt;handy until it becomes engraved in your brain. If you stray from it, get <br/>\n&gt;back on it. Don&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t work and abandon it. It works. Just do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Keep a calendar, it saves time and money (i have spent so much in library <br/>\n&gt;fines do to disorganization it&#39;s not funny) Flylady has a big notebook, I <br/>\n&gt;have everything scaled down to fit in a few pages in a planner or even a <br/>\n&gt;small packet. Go to fineprint.com and d/l a free program to scale down your <br/>\n&gt;printable pages to save space, paper and ink.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;How I incorporated zones: Flylady breaks up each area of the house into 4 <br/>\n&gt;or 5 zones, working on one zone each week. I cannot neglect part of the <br/>\n&gt;house for a month or longer, so I line them up to the days of the week, <br/>\n&gt;monday=zone 1, tuesday=zone 2 etc. Make a master list of things that are <br/>\n&gt;important to you and then on that day, pick one and do it for 15 minutes, <br/>\n&gt;if you can&#39;t do it for one week, no biggie, pick that zone up the next <br/>\n&gt;time. Do the same things the same day every week, like pay the bills on <br/>\n&gt;friday, wash the towels and whites on monday.... things won&#39;t have a chance <br/>\n&gt;to pile up...Practice the do it now method, pick up things as you move <br/>\n&gt;through the house, put things away as soon as you are done with them, open <br/>\n&gt;the mail over a trash can, you get the idea.....it&#39;s rather simple but <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t occur naturally in the organized-challenged such as myself...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If I don&#39;t get up everyday and do the simple things like get dressed and <br/>\n&gt;cleaned up and make my bed, I wander aimlessly the rest of the day. If I do <br/>\n&gt;my routines consistently, I can forget about whether laundry is piled up, <br/>\n&gt;what I am going to cook for dinner, etc and really BE with my kids. We can <br/>\n&gt;just get up and go on a field trip when the mood strikes us or when the <br/>\n&gt;weather hits 50degrees, like on tuesday. It works for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If anyone needs help establishing routines and zones, you can go to <br/>\n&gt;Flylady.net and get the info there, you don&#39;t have to subscribe to the <br/>\n&gt;email list.
