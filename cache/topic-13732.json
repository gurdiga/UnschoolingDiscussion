They must take the same norm-referenced test at the<br/>\nsame grade levels as public school students. Currently, public school<br/>\nstudents are tested in grades 5, 7 and 10 using the SAT9.<br/>\n<br/>\n(But please do read the websites yourself. One of our best allies is being<br/>\ninformed :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Tia. It isn&#39;t fair to the kids or our ability to help them<br/>\nlearn naturally to assume that natural learning will keep them on the same<br/>\ntrack as public school. It won&#39;t. Their track will be as unique as our<br/>\nchildren are. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially math. Not because math is hard but because of the way math is<br/>\ntaught. Learning math naturally means slowly building up a picture of how<br/>\nnumbers work by using them. It&#39;s the same way they&#39;ve learned English.<br/>\n(Which has worked splendidly hasn&#39;t it? :-) It&#39;s like the jigsaw puzzle Pam<br/>\nmentioned before. Learning naturally means building tiny sections over the<br/>\nwhole thing, putting in bits and pieces and making connections here and<br/>\nthere. In school they don&#39;t get to look at the picture on the box and they<br/>\nstart in the top corner and work painstakingly across. If kids see some<br/>\nconnection somewhere else the teachers tell them to set it aside and they&#39;ll<br/>\nget to that later.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when they&#39;re tested, the kids *aren&#39;t* tested on what they know. They&#39;re<br/>\n*only* tested on what they know of the stuff across the top of the puzzle.<br/>\nIf the schools had decided to test your kids on how well they were acquiring<br/>\nlanguage and they had little interest in standard kid stuff but could<br/>\nexpound about dinosaurs, they might test &quot;behind&quot; but would that really mean<br/>\nthey were behind? Or would it really mean they knew *different* stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also would like to know how do you all really teach the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The same way I &quot;taught&quot; her to walk and speak and read.

I would appriciate any help anyone could offer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Learning math from games is great. Using games as a way to get math into<br/>\nkids can make kids avoid games. It&#39;s like deciding kids need to learn to<br/>\nhammer so finding a lot of projects for them to do that you think they&#39;d<br/>\nfind fun. What if they don&#39;t? What if they&#39;d rather do something else? If we<br/>\nassume that the projects are necessary to learn hammering, we&#39;ll get<br/>\nnervous. But if we realize that tool use is leared as a *side effect* of<br/>\ndoing what interests you, then it can help ease our worries and see learning<br/>\nin a whole new way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is a tool. It helps us understand the world better. It helps us compare<br/>\nthings and make connections. But unless the kids are curious about the world<br/>\nand wanting to make the connetions then math is pointless. (And they *will*<br/>\nbe curious unless we get in their way!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo play games for fun. :-) Play board games. Software. Dice games. Yes, even<br/>\nvideo games! The user&#39;s guides are full of charts and maps and statistics<br/>\nthat schools spend tedious hours trying to get into kids. But kids will<br/>\nstudy the guids *for fun*! Because the point of the game is figuring out the<br/>\npuzzle, not doing the math. The math is just a tool for figuring out the<br/>\ngame :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] new to unschooling","postDate":"1029449343","msgId":41214,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5ODFERkUxLjEwNkQlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjk0MjIzOTYuMTUzOC44MTEzMS5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41126,"nextInTopic":41328,"prevInTime":41213,"nextInTime":41215,"topicId":13732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s 1st grade <br/>\naround here and they are still learning their sounds and are beginning <br/>\nreaders.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd each kid is different.  That&#39;s what I explain to my daughter anyway.  My <br/>\nson read at 4 1/2 yo but my daughter is already the ripe old age of almost-6 <br/>\nand is a beginning reader.  She actually reads better than she will admit but <br/>\nthat&#39;s another story.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the whole idea that all 6 year-olds will be reading at the same time <br/>\nis just silly so maybe a smile for the rude stranger and a hug for your <br/>\ndaughter would be the best answer to anyone needing one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think a large part of why your friend talks about reading is that that <br/>\nis all they teach in the lower grades.  That&#39;s the major emphasis.  Now, if <br/>\nyour child likes math or science or art beyond coloring, there aren&#39;t that <br/>\nmany opportunities to shine.  But if you can read, but not to too well <br/>\nbecause then you are ahead of the pack, then you are doing just what the <br/>\nteacher wants you to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me just say that my K daughter (pre-reader/beginning reader) would be <br/>\njust as bored with coloring a latter a week as my son was at that age (when <br/>\nhe was a full-fledged reader).

I<br/>\n </span></blockquote> could<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; really use some encouragement. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    To me the true definition of unschooling is child/student directed <br/>\nlearning, with the child making the choices and the parent seeing his/herself <br/>\nas a facilitator rather than as a teacher. For each child this will look <br/>\ndifferent. For one it may look nothing like &quot;school&quot; while another may be <br/>\nreally into academic pursuits. The key is that the child is being supported <br/>\nin making choices that work for him/her rather than being imposed on by the <br/>\nadult&#39;s picture of things.  Also academic pursuits are generally suited to <br/>\nthe older child&#39;s brain (depending on the individual development). All of my <br/>\nkids learned to read in a mostly organic way; the oldest one at 4 and the <br/>\nother two at around 8 or 9 years old.<br/>\n     We have always been unschoolers partly based on the interests and <br/>\nlearning style of our oldest, Jenny,who is now 19. Also philosophically I <br/>\nbelieve in unschooling. Over time however the younger two kids, Ariana and <br/>\nMichael. now aged 11 & 15 started wanting more of an academic focus for a <br/>\nvariety of reasons. We are now living in California and  they are enrolled in <br/>\na distance learning charter school. This provides some structure without <br/>\nfeeling oppressive and a share of public school tax money to order the <br/>\nmaterials of our choice. <br/>\n     This would never have worked for Jenny, who is artistically and <br/>\ndramatically motivated. She would have found the academic categories <br/>\n(English, Science, etc.) restrictive and unworkable. To me unschooling is not <br/>\na set path but a journey of exploration that is unique to each child and each <br/>\nfamily. We still consider ourselves to be unschoolers since being in the <br/>\ncharter school is their choice. In fact the way I found it was by exploring <br/>\npublic school independent study programs at my son&#39;s request. I feel that <br/>\neach of us in our family is successfully in progress with becoming who we are <br/>\nmeant to be. Good luck with finding your way. -Amalia Darling-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54991,"nextTopicId":55161}}
