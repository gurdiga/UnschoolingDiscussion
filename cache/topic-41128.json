Any suggestions on how to ease our family into this<br/>\n&gt; transition?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dear bkmblpn, <br/>\n<br/>\nEasing into unschooling....?  Hmmmm  Have you ever tried &quot;easing&quot; youself<br/>\noff a cliff. How &#39;bout &quot;easing&quot; your car into a concrete wall at 40 mph.<br/>\nThinking about those gives one the same excited and nervous feeling. We<br/>\nknow it&#39;s there. A lot of it comes from the kind things your relatives say,<br/>\nlike, &quot;You&#39;re going to ruin that boy....and he&#39;s so smart, too...God, it&#39;s a<br/>\nshame. Where did you get this idea...I&#39;ve never really trusted you, bkmblpn,<br/>\nnow I know why.&quot;   ?^)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs has been noted often, unschooling is what you don&#39;t do. Too bad there<br/>\nisn&#39;t a good name for the positives of it, other that simply living a real<br/>\nlife with your child. But the transition requires a conscious effort to<br/>\npretend that there is no such thing as school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany adults can&#39;t do that. School is the elephant in the middle of their<br/>\nhouse. They can&#39;t imagine life without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo your little trick is to unschool your self, or deschool yourself, as some<br/>\nsee this need. Your kid will not have a problem at all, I promise, except<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s &quot;bored&quot; and remembers a friend who&#39;s still in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the friends from school as needed. He need those contacts if possible.<br/>\nOtherwise, be examples for him. Take your own interests seriously and he<br/>\nwill develop his own. Give him access to real activities in your community.<br/>\nLet him involve himself deeply, say, in exactly what the stockpeople do at<br/>\nthe market -- the ones who put the stuff on the shelves. Why is the Jelly on<br/>\nthis shelf instead of that one? Why is the milk all the way in the back of<br/>\nthe market? and the meat, too.? and why are there a thousand little things<br/>\nright at the checkout?<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar thrilling questions can be pondered all day as you walk around the<br/>\ncommunity and watch things closely and figure out why everything is the way<br/>\nit is. Who decided where the streets should be?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody stop me, please... let the poor woman think up her own damn<br/>\nquestions for her poor son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really important stuff is what is on that kid&#39;s mind. After schooling,<br/>\nhe probably has the opinion that his ideas are not important to anyone.<br/>\nSchool has that purpose -- to kill the spirit of children and thus turn<br/>\ncreative individuals into obedient sheep.<br/>\n<br/>\n So your job is to TAKE HIM  SERIOUSLY -- ALWAYS.  There&#39;s even a website or<br/>\na group called Taking Children Seriously. That is sometimes a transition for<br/>\nadults in itself, listening to the thoughts and ideas of kids and discussing<br/>\nthem without being disparaging or condescending....after all, they&#39;re so,<br/>\nwell, childish. You need to get into the practice of that, so your kid will<br/>\ntrust you with his thoughts and will also be interested in yours (sometimes,<br/>\nmaybe, if you&#39;re lucky).<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: &quot;Unschooling&quot; is the word to remember whenever either or your<br/>\nspouse get the urge to &quot;educate&quot; the kid. If you &quot;teach&quot; him anything, teach<br/>\nhim not to let you do that to him, ever, unless he BEGS you. He&#39;ll love<br/>\ncontrolling that part of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchooling is artificial. UNschooling is real life...it&#39;s everything that<br/>\nschool isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us know how it goes. . . once a week at least. Consider this<br/>\nUNschool-anon for former school addicts. We&#39;re listening.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41131,"nextTopicId":41127}}
