My dad was not happy but survived finding out. Now 15 + years later, my dad<br/>\nhas 2 tattoos (as does his wife). My dad is a very straight laced, retired air<br/>\nforce colonel (reserves), republican  who also has a cpa. His wife is a vp of <br/>\npersonnel of a hospital.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother has added a tattoo, a nipple ring and a tongue ring. He also has gone through<br/>\nvarious hair styles and colors. He is a great guy...never into drugs or drinking. Loves<br/>\nplaying bass in a band, teaches violin to kids (who love him because he is so cool).<br/>\nHe has a great head on his shoulders. For awhile he was volunteering at the Red Cross<br/>\ndriving senior citizens around phoenix. The little old ladies loved him, he has that<br/>\nkind of personality. He also put thought into his self-expression...he did not want <br/>\nanything that too extreme or that he would regret having when he got older. They are <br/>\nvery discretely placed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hubby got a tattoo 2 years ago...a really cool celtic band around his ankle. I have<br/>\nbeen trying to get up enough nerve to get a small one. I get faint really easily.<br/>\nMy brother nearly fainted himself when he heard that I might get one LOL! I guess<br/>\nI don&#39;t seem the type... ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128897139,"authorName":"love-it-here@juno.com","from":"love-it-here@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: Tattoos","postDate":"1042841259","msgId":55455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTE3LjE3MDc0MS4tNDU0MDk3LjEubG92ZS1pdC1oZXJlQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55505,"prevInTime":55454,"nextInTime":55456,"topicId":55455,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Fri, 17 Jan 2003 16:21:07 -0500 Debra Hartrum-Disciples Now ... ds2 ...

For about two years<br/>\npreviously she had been discussing it with her Mom, almost as an &quot;I dare<br/>\nyou to say no&quot; thing. Mom laid down the law, and told her if she got one<br/>\nthat she was out of the house. More out of rebellion than anything<br/>\nelse,on her 18th birthday my niece went and got a tatoo, and pierced her<br/>\nnose, and pierced her bellybutton, and found an apartment. Well now, at<br/>\n21, she is back at home with Mom, asking her mom why she can&#39;t get past<br/>\nthe first interview for any job she has applied at, sad about the scar<br/>\nshe has on her nose where her piercing got all infected. She actually<br/>\ntold her Mom that if she would have just said it would be fine if you get<br/>\na tattoo, that she probably wouldn&#39;t have had it done. Maybe if you just<br/>\ntold your sons that it was fine, and took the younger ones to see how it<br/>\nwas done and how painful it is, maybe the glamor and desire would be<br/>\ngone. Maybe you or your husband could put on a really good fake tattoo<br/>\nfor a while, to show them how silly it could look when they get older. Go<br/>\nout in public places with your sons, bearing a big old tribal tat across<br/>\nyour forehead. Maybe they&#39;ll get the idea.<br/>\nI was told that I couldn&#39;t get my ears pierced until I was 14. So on my<br/>\n14th birthday I went to the mall and had my ears pierced....5 times. At<br/>\nleast the holes weren&#39;t permanent.<br/>\nI am definetely not looking forward to teenagers!!!<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55568,"nextTopicId":55411}}
