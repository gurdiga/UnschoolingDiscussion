Others interpret the requirement as a &quot;daily&quot; log, even though it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t say &quot;daily&quot; in the law, but they still think it only needs to <br/>\ncontain the titles of books read. So there would be an entry for each <br/>\nof the 180 days, but the only thing entered would be book titles - <br/>\noften the same title over and over, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Others interpret it as you seem to be doing, as a log of learning <br/>\nactivities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the log is to provide it to your evaluator to use in <br/>\ndetermining if the child is receiving an appropriate education.

One way <br/>\nto find out is to ask other homeschoolers in your district. Another way <br/>\nis to keep a pretty thorough log for one year, but turn in a very <br/>\nabbreviated form of it and wait to see if that is accepted.

Sometimes the regulations sound daunting but are really quite simple to meet.  Many states now have unschooling groups as well.  (Yeah!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere in WA we have to do an annual assessment or standardized test.  I do the assessment.  Basically, once a year I write up many of the things my girls have done during the past 12 months.  Since WA asks us to include subjects, I do categorize it that way.  It does NOT change what we do on a day to day basis.  It is just a matter of me sitting down now and then and jotting down a few things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I categorize it by subject, the girls don&#39;t need to be told &quot;now you are doing math&quot; or &quot;now you are doing social studies&quot;.  Really, the hardest part is that subjects overlap and some activities could be categorized under several subjects.  The first year I listed things multiple times.  If something could be reading and history, I listed it under both.  Now I just list each thing once under the most obvious category - or just pick one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the years go by I am getting more relaxed about it.

(maps/science/costume/psychology), because if you have <br/>\n&gt; fears and prejudices left over from school, it&#39;s a good thing to do <br/>\n&gt; whatever <br/>\n&gt; internal work you need to get over that, so you can answer your children&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; questions without showing (and maybe passing on) an aversion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22690,"nextTopicId":22693}}
