This is in northwest Italy (not too far from Turin), <br/>\nin the Piemontese region. (Go get out those maps!) An interesting <br/>\nplace, especially because folks don&#39;t really speak Italian, but a <br/>\nlocal dialect (Piemontese) -- doesn&#39;t matter much to me, as I speak <br/>\nneither!<br/>\n <br/>\nSo what am I doing here?<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving completed my new homeschooling book (Homeschooling and the <br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery -- out March 1, you can read a little bit <br/>\nabout it at www.skylarksings.com, though my site is also going <br/>\nthrough an upgrade), and two books on the uses of storytelling --<br/>\n&quot;The Healing Heart-Families: Storytelling to Encourage Resilient and <br/>\nHealthy Families&quot; and &quot;The Healing Heart-Communities: Storytelling to <br/>\nBuild Strong and Health Communities&quot;, also out on March 1, I am in <br/>\nItaly working with the original author to bring out an English <br/>\nedition of a book about my Indian &quot;parents&quot; -- on their land reform <br/>\nefforts, and their struggles against multinational prawn farming <br/>\ninterests that are destroying the coastal areas of south India. It is <br/>\na profound and very moving story, and I feel very privileged to be <br/>\ninvolved in telling it! Last night, I got to address a group in <br/>\nMilan -- there is quite a lot of interest in Fair Trade, <br/>\nglobalization, and third world issues here, and they were shocked <br/>\nwhen I explained how ignorant about foreign issues the American <br/>\npublic is generally speaking. <br/>\n<br/>\nPublic meetings here BEGIN at 9 o&#39;clock, and people bring their <br/>\nchildren! (so I got to speak a little bit about homeschooling, too, <br/>\nwhich is not unknown here, but relatively rare.) But mostly it was a <br/>\ncelebration of my parents work on land reform, community development <br/>\nand child welfare.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers have been part of it, too. Last year, with royalties <br/>\nfrom &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot; and with contributions from <br/>\nhomeschoolers, we managed to purchased two cinderblock making <br/>\nmachines, so that people in this desperately poor area of South India <br/>\ncan build their own cyclone-proof housing (they formerly lived in rat-<br/>\ninfested mud and straw housing that would often be destroyed in <br/>\nfloods.) The local people make bricks, sell them into the cities at a <br/>\nprofit, and use the profits to buy more raw materials to build their <br/>\nown homes. And since cinderblock doesn&#39;t require any firing (as do <br/>\nmore traditional bricks), it saves very scare lumber resources, and <br/>\nis very good on the environment. We hope to build (or help people <br/>\nthemselves build) 10,000 homes -- these are people who were landless <br/>\nlaborers (from &quot;untouchable&quot;) castes for some 8 or 10 centuries, and <br/>\nthrough land reform struggles, 10,000 families (70,000 people) now <br/>\nhave land. But the pollution of the land by multinational prawn <br/>\ninterests, backed by the World Bank, has been terrible!  We brought <br/>\nplenty of pictures and slides.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother also collects children -- by the side of the road, living <br/>\non the margins of garbage dumps, under bridges, and we now have about <br/>\n140 children living in hostels in 3 locations. Most of them <br/>\nare &quot;adopted&quot; (supported, not brought to Italy) by Italian aid <br/>\nagencies, and many the donors were at my public meeting last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for me, my work with homeschoolers and with social development in <br/>\nIndia -- both among my great loves -- is coming together, and I feel <br/>\nprivileged to be allowed to be part of both of them. And I get to <br/>\ndrink wine and eat the most wonderful cheese. I&#39;m a lucky guy!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55838,"nextTopicId":55864}}
