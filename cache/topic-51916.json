We went on Monday, the first time for me since mid-October, <br/>\nbut the kids had been with various nannies.

Then he started dancing around.  They don&#39;t mind <br/>\nnoise, I think they were just put off by the boys and ballet thing.

We went on Monday, the first time for me since mid-October, <br/>\nbut the kids had been with various nannies.  They were all so happy to see <br/>\nme, talking about my ankle, etc.  I usually search the catalogue on line and <br/>\ngo in with a list, but add and delete as I go.  I was amazed that my nanny <br/>\nwas able to fill the list, but the librarian told me she had taken the list <br/>\nfrom her and gotten the books for me.  Wasn&#39;t that sweet!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps that we are in a suburb of Chicago and really have the whole state <br/>\nto interlibrary loan from.  We can get most anything.  And if they have to go <br/>\nout of their network, they charge a $3 fee, but can still get it usually.  I <br/>\nnoticed yesterday they had a book with a &quot;new&quot; sticker on it that we had <br/>\nrequested from interlibrary loan and mentioned it to the librarian.  She read <br/>\nit when it came in and decided her children&#39;s section should purchase it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, they were a bit put off by Nathan&#39;s Swan Lake obsession.  <br/>\nWe were the only ones in there for a while and we got some big kid ballet <br/>\nbooks, which he loved.  Then he started dancing around.  They don&#39;t mind <br/>\nnoise, I think they were just put off by the boys and ballet thing.  One of <br/>\nthe ladies said &quot;Well, it can&#39;t hurt him.&quot;  As if she has trying to convince <br/>\nherself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d request the unjobbing book or if you have to buy it, go used from Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unjobbing was balance/libraries","postDate":"1040220083","msgId":52147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0ZC4xOTA4Njk2Ni4yYjMxZDliM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52143,"nextInTopic":52164,"prevInTime":52146,"nextInTime":52148,"topicId":51916,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/18/2002 8:47:40 AM Eastern Standard Time, ...
