When the Gun talk was going <br/>\non (I get a digest version) I read the amount of messages, looked at the <br/>\ntitles and skipped to the ones I wanted to read.  That&#39;s not to say I didn&#39;t <br/>\nread some of the gun talk, just not all of it.  It wasn&#39;t such a hot topic <br/>\nfor me, but I thoroughly enjoyed the banter back and forth of the people that <br/>\nit was an important subject too.  I even learned some things about not only <br/>\npeople but guns.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t learning what we are all about?<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nDawn Falbe  <br/>\nPersonal Development Coach<br/>\nRelocational Astrologer<br/>\n(520) 579-2646<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\nThe Path of Least Resistance is Inside of You<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\nEnlightening women on how to live their Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world<br/>\n are people who get up and look for the<br/>\n circumstances they want, and, <br/>\nif they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.&quot;-George <br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24398,"nextTopicId":24144}}
