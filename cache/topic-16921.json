What I don&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand is how you can unschool and force your children into doing <br/>\nschoolwork that they don&#39;t want to do.  I agree 100% with those who <br/>\nsay that workbooks are great for those who want them.  I thought it <br/>\nwas wonderful to hear from an unschooler who happened to like explore <br/>\nthe world through literature and textbooks!  But her experience was <br/>\nbased on, I believe, the essence of unschooling, meaning she chose it <br/>\nand was not forced into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have days that I am amazed by all of you that &quot;do&quot; so much to <br/>\neducate your children, but when I try to &quot;do&quot; for them, they just <br/>\nwant to do their own thing.  I&#39;ve always respected that about them.  <br/>\nTaking that huge leap of faith that your children will learn what <br/>\nthey need as they need to know it can be sooo hard, but they really, <br/>\nreally do!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the wonderful suggested readings by John Holt come to mind, <br/>\nand the freedom that comes with this kind of living!  I hope that <br/>\nmore families that consider themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; can truly <br/>\nembrace this philosophy.
