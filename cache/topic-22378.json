The older sister<br/>\n is 16, not exactly a baby and they are obviously able to take care of<br/>\n themselves.   Do any of you have any idea how traumatic it is to have a<br/>\n police force insert themselves into your live when you have not asked for it<br/>\n and do not desire their &#39;help&#39;?  Take my word for it, no matter how this<br/>\n ends, it will never end for these children.  They will have this event as a<br/>\n turning point for their entire lives.<br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;sigh&gt;  No easy answers.  Here&#39;s hoping the kids manage to not make their<br/>\n circumstances so bad in the eyes of some authority person that this haunts<br/>\n them for the rest of their lives AND that no one is seriously injured<br/>\n (family under &#39;siege, law enforcement OR neighbors)!<br/>\n <br/>\n Eiraul &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   In a way yes I agree,leave them alone. But letting 20 some dogs go on <br/>\nsomeone is  not acceptable conduct. they were also reportedly eating lilly <br/>\npads (or something) and pond water soup. These people need help. Then again <br/>\nlet them live like this and suffer the consequences. Then that may lead to <br/>\nhospitalization which leads to medicade and tax money. All b/c they didn&#39;t <br/>\nseek help sooner or learn to live differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Seems to me a family living like that (if it is true) needs help. No one <br/>\nin their right mind has such a large pack of dogs and lets them run as a pack <br/>\nand hunt their own food. Something is wrong here folks.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I am all for living off the grid if someone so chooses but, do it wisely <br/>\nand responsibly. Truely learn to live.<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22371,"nextTopicId":20210}}
