I have wondered whether unschooling is<br/>\n compatible with a faith which requires belief and reliance on a greater <br/>\nauthority.<br/>\n It may be a difficult task to encourage freedom of thought and choice on the <br/>\none<br/>\n hand and &quot;unquestioning&quot; obedience on the other.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have wondered the same, but from the perspective of being involved in a <br/>\nreligion that is very much this way.  In fact, my dh and I have spent the <br/>\nlast 5 years indoctrinating ourselves and our children in this &quot;unquestioning <br/>\nobedience,&quot; and now we are trying to struggle out from underneath what we see <br/>\nas the debris.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have fought and fought with myself over this...Do I have to abandon my <br/>\nreligion, my faith or Do I have to abandon my strongly held values of <br/>\nnon-coercion and a child-centered style of educating?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very, very difficult indeed, I think, to come to a feeling of peace <br/>\nabout it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, frankly, it is coming to me from a place that others might not consider <br/>\nrelevant, but I happen to...the very teachings of Jesus Christ.  I am making <br/>\na comprehensive self-study of those Biblical documents, trying to rely on my <br/>\nown interpretations rather than those of experts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m finding that the values I hold about raising children in a gentle <br/>\nmanner, letting them lead and trying to help them develop their own unique <br/>\ntalents is very much what the lessons of Jesus are all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I didn&#39;t write this to preach.   I mainly just wanted to affirm your <br/>\nidea that there is a conflict here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to hear the way other people have handled what I too think <br/>\nis a conflict and like you said, hear from people who might not think it is a <br/>\nconflict and why  they don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have come to the conclusion that I can&#39;t abandon my faith.  I  might at <br/>\nsome time abandon my &quot;organized religion&quot;... that lies in the future and I <br/>\ncannot comprehend that right now. <br/>\n I have also come to the conclusion that I can&#39;t abandon my educational and <br/>\nchild-raising values.  They are too dearly who I am and who I believe I was <br/>\nmeant to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, right now, I choose to live with the dichotomy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I continue to journey on...<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol from WI</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"rick and deborah farrington","from":"rick and deborah farrington &lt;honeybee@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"1nf1R81uonmNMoPY5JcnmpAJl8GCaIcwE74mazr8uV9zU6VD-Zmje5QPuzTBEAtXbKGl5-JNZsC0lEM6ojfAuO8rRVIVwkyZHcKuyyYnvhxRQiwgX7_oHjfO","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Tying up loose ends","postDate":"937041574","msgId":2797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTcuMjc5Ny45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2796,"nextInTopic":2853,"prevInTime":2796,"nextInTime":2798,"topicId":2787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yeah my kids watch pbs alot, and i shouldnt complainabout the reading, but when i see them constantly with a book it get s old. but they get tired of me being ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-206919251\">yeah my kids watch pbs alot, and i shouldnt complainabout the reading, but when<br/>\ni see them constantly with a book it get s old. but they get tired of me being<br/>\non this puter all the time! they do read magazines that are educational and dd<br/>\nread the first line over my shoulder when i said i would have a no novels week<br/>\nshe said she&#39;d get out of that groove soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nB & T Simpson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;B & T Simpson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michigan@...\">michigan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: rick and deborah farrington &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeybee@...\">honeybee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, September 08, 1999 11:51 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Tying up loose ends<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: rick and deborah farrington &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeybee@...\">honeybee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;i have a 13yo and a 14 yo and they just read all the time, im thinking of<br/>\n&gt; having a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;no novels week!! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh My!!

I also have a 14<br/>\n&gt; yr old that went to ps through the 6th grade or almost all of it.

Now they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want anything to do with learning anything even if they don&#39;t now they are<br/>\n&gt; they fight it. I have not really asked them to do anything special for me but<br/>\n&gt; all 3 of my children hate to read and never do it on their own. even the<br/>\n&gt; directions for their palystation games. they won&#39;t pick up a pencil or anything.<br/>\n&gt; If I even ask them to write a letter to Grandma they just throw a fit. I am<br/>\n&gt; wondering if they will ever be deschooled? I am going to the library in Friday<br/>\n&gt; and they are fussing that they don&#39;t want to go. My children spend their time<br/>\n&gt; playing palystation or n64 or listening to music or watching TV. I just wish<br/>\n&gt; they would do more reading.

I&#39;ve even been told you can&#39;t be a Christian and Unschool.  A<br/>\nfriend from the past recently wrote me that she was terrified of<br/>\nunschooling both academically and spiritually.  She never responded to my<br/>\nattempts to show her that unschooling is simply a method and does not need<br/>\nto cross purposes with the authority you speak of above.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe conflict is certainly there with people of authoritarian natures.  I<br/>\ngrew up under a very authoritarian heavy hand and know what the thinking<br/>\nis.  But growing up that way I guess I see the down side and don&#39;t want my<br/>\nkids to be &#39;broken&#39; like that.  I encourage them to question - even<br/>\nspiritual authority (except God&#39;s of course) - and it does bring it&#39;s<br/>\nchallenges.  We just went through a discussion on this recently in our<br/>\nfamily.  Then I reminded my dh that we had done all we could to teach our<br/>\nkids to look for options when confronted with a roadblock.  So when there<br/>\nwas something they want and we said no, they would try a dozen different<br/>\nways to get us to change our minds - questioning why or why not, etc.  We<br/>\nhad to laugh, we would rather put up with what authoritarians view as<br/>\nargumentativeness and bucking authority and have kids that can think for<br/>\nthemselves and find other options when life gives them a roadblock.  Yes,<br/>\nit is certainly in conflict with some people&#39;s spiritual lives.  But I<br/>\nbelieve that it would do many people a lot of good to learn to question the<br/>\nauthority of those in charge at churches.  But that is another story for<br/>\nanother day :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIn His Service,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaraine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"The O&#39;Donnells","from":"The O&#39;Donnells &lt;praxis@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lVU8OOERb_4SRlHuEc77lLtVCprC_RTuifnksUQcKZODEW9sxhXRcIMbmvFcWzben9cobq72WlZXUMqCAZ514Z_IO6L0VZWJcQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Tying up loose ends","postDate":"936932355","msgId":2853,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMDAuMjg1My45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2797,"nextInTopic":2855,"prevInTime":2852,"nextInTime":2854,"topicId":2787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"At 10:52 PM 9/8/99 -0400, you wrote: She is also one that wants me to tell her what to do so that ...
