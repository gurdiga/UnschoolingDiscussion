His dad is in the <br/>\nmilitary.  They&#39;re living in Germany.  There&#39;s a war imminent.  His dad&#39;s not <br/>\nhome.  He needs to stay connected with a human instead of escaping into his <br/>\nown six year old fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe knows where the Gameboy is and when that seems more important again than <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s doing, he&#39;ll play again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a whole sick family.  I with my still-swelling, often hurting, <br/>\nOctober-broken leg and sick myself, was still the healthiest one here for a <br/>\ncouple of days.  People drank juice.  They ate chicken soup I made.  They <br/>\nused kleenex I brought them, and they got their sheets changed when *I* said <br/>\nit was time.  They washed their hands extra much.  They called people to say <br/>\nthey were sick if they were going to need to miss something (I didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nenforce that, because they all remembered.  Kirby missed a day of work and <br/>\none session of teaching karate, but he called in advance so people could <br/>\narrange around him.

Keith missed two days of work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the conditions were special and unusual, they were totally willing to <br/>\nbe directed.
