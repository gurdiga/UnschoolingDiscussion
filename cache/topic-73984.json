Try <br/>\n  &gt; it out in various situations.  Put it out in public to let others poke <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt; prod and see if it works in more than your own little situation.  If <br/>\n  it does?  <br/>\n  &gt; If it REALLY works from all angles, and you haven&#39;t found it to <br/>\n  be weak or <br/>\n  &gt; shaky, then it can become a conviction.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; People probably don&#39;t have many convictions, compared to the <br/>\n  number of ideas <br/>\n  &gt; they have.  I have hundreds of ideas for each of my few <br/>\n  convictions.

Some gets filed, used, tossed...<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; But a conviction, that&#39;s worth defending.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; It is my conviction that it takes courage to unschool.  It takes <br/>\n  creativity, <br/>\n  &gt; energy, stamina and plain old bravery.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; We not only have to have ready answers and/or a thick skin for <br/>\n  strangers and <br/>\n  &gt; relatives, we have to face the tauntings and insults of the other <br/>\n  &gt; homeschoolers.  We have to hear other homeschoolers who <br/>\n  think they&#39;re brilliant because <br/>\n  &gt; they have a schedule and some test scores tell us we&#39;re lazy <br/>\n  and unmotivated.    <br/>\n  &gt; It would be easier (and sometimes even cheaper) to just <br/>\n  spring for the <br/>\n  &gt; friggin&#39; curriculum and shush up the neighbors and relatives <br/>\n  and not-really-friends <br/>\n  &gt; in the homeschooling community.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Lots are not courageous enough to hang in there.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

In my experience, I find that my approach, and the materials I utilize, change every year. Some things we outgrow, some things were recommended to me and didn&#39;t really work in the first place... The beauty of it is that my kids learn, despite me!! When my daughter was preschool-age, I had a curriculum of sorts for her.

Several of you replied to the last phrase about it taking courage to unschool.  I understand that it takes less courage to unschool than to send your child to public school.  What I was trying to say is closer to the line from the poem about the path less taken.  &quot;I have taken the path less taken and it has made all the difference.&quot;   For me, it is always &#39;easier&#39; to go along with the crowd but that is not necessarily the best route to take.  For me, it would be easier to enroll my daughter in preschool and then public school.  It would be better for her to be homeschooled, I believe.  I am still working out what form that homeschooling would take.  All I knew about unschooling a month ago was what I read in the Homeschooling Almanac.   Thanks for the suggestions of web sites, book suggestions are welcome too.  I am especially interested in the preschool/early elementary stages.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda Siemsen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOLD POSTING<br/>\nMy life is a work in progress so I did finish and pass the Kindermusik class.  Gwen is still signed up for kindergarten this fall.  I sent some books on painting (from the home schooling references) to them for summer fun.  I&#39;m thinking and trying out unschooling ideas with my daughter.   I think it takes a lot of courage to unschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74285,"nextTopicId":74573}}
