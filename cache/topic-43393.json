They passed out warm (actually hot) washcloths. <br/>\nWhat a wonderful thing that was! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, talk to the kids about the noise.

Explain how it <br/>\nfeels when the plane takes off, how it feels to be laying back for a few <br/>\nminutes, that feeling in your stomach when the plane levels off, and when the <br/>\nplane lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe traveled tons when I was a kid. I have been in little nuts-and-bolts <br/>\nplanes, planes that weren&#39;t fit to fly 5 feet in, planes that were long and <br/>\nsleek and beautiful where you didn&#39;t hear a sound or feel a thing. I flew in <br/>\na plane that lost 3 of its 4 engines, and a UPS plane once took me across the <br/>\nPacific. There are a few things I ALWAYS take with me. Ear plugs; to help <br/>\nwith the noise, Chewing gum; to help my ears pop, A hot washcloth in a <br/>\nthermos; for after the plane has leveled off. (I boil water, put the <br/>\nwashcloth in, wring it out, microwave the washcloth and then drop it into a <br/>\nthermos. This keeps it hot for a few hours. I also put boiling water in the <br/>\nthermos to heat it up, and dump the water out before I put the washcloth in.) <br/>\nI flew on September 30, last year and was allowed to take my thermos on the <br/>\nplane. You might want to check. I also take books, paper and crayons. Even in <br/>\nthe most economical planes there are usually trays that pull down from the <br/>\nseats. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to the kids about the noise, and the feelings they will experience. Talk <br/>\nto them about popping their ears, and chewing gum. Talk to them about their <br/>\nfears. Take them to the park and swing them. (its not quite the same, but <br/>\nclose) Get some ear plugs and show them how to wear them. Call the airline <br/>\nand ask if they still hand out those wing pins. Ask if the kids could <br/>\npossibly meet the captain. Even if it is before take off, out of the plane. <br/>\nAsk if you can board first so the kids can see the plane without tons of <br/>\npeople milling around the aisles. <br/>\nGood Luck!<br/>\n~Nancy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123374705,"authorName":"ejcrewe@aol.com","from":"ejcrewe@...","profile":"ejcrewe2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fear of Flying","postDate":"1031544953","msgId":43393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2LjJkNzdiOGFiLjJhYWQ3YTc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43395,"prevInTime":43392,"nextInTime":43394,"topicId":43393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get my 3 and 4 year olds on an airplane?
