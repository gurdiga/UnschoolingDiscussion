The truth is, they may not get one, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this response leaves people with a blank expression.  And, sooner or later we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have to face the moment of truth, when the inlaws will want some answers.  Are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; any of you out there struggling with this?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t have high school diplomas (I&#39;m in New Zealand), but do have other things,<br/>\n&gt; so I have often faced this question. My oldest is 18, joined the work force a year<br/>\n&gt; ago. People still ask how I managed to get him his &#39;qualifictions&#39;, and look aghast<br/>\n&gt; when I say we didn&#39;t bother because he didn&#39;t need them! He is working for a<br/>\n&gt; beekeeper and learning that way. Of course with three more sons coming along (16,<br/>\n&gt; 12, 9) I&#39;m going to face that question for a lot  longer!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What I try to do, nicely, is to try to get them to answer for themselves. First, I<br/>\n&gt; ask them in what circumstances my child would need such a thing. Which brings to<br/>\n&gt; their notice, often for the first time I think, that you don&#39;t need these bits of<br/>\n&gt; paper to breathe, eat or even work. The we examine alternatives to the ones that<br/>\n&gt; supposedly need them - and I haven&#39;t found much that doesn&#39;t have an alternative.<br/>\n&gt; Then, finally, we get on to how you can get the bits of paper if  you really really<br/>\n&gt; want / need them. (correspondence schools, community classes......)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Usually, with a bit of guidance they end up seeing things in a new light, and<br/>\n&gt; answering their own questions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Carol<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Emhenry@aol.com","from":"Emhenry@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QQE6EK3gjGm9RN3BO0djbPkgJH5YqvYOMwybKa7aggF4JT305w7PXjEJaQfXob-yyLr3a7GQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: highschool diploma?","postDate":"940892239","msgId":4044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNjguNDA0NC45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4043,"nextInTopic":4046,"prevInTime":4043,"nextInTime":4045,"topicId":4019,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The great missing Mamalin surfaces!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First, I<br/>\nask them in what circumstances my child would need such a thing. Which brings to<br/>\ntheir notice, often for the first time I think, that you don&#39;t need these bits of<br/>\npaper to breathe, eat or even work. The we examine alternatives to the ones that<br/>\nsupposedly need them - and I haven&#39;t found much that doesn&#39;t have an alternative.<br/>\nThen, finally, we get on to how you can get the bits of paper if  you really really<br/>\nwant / need them.
