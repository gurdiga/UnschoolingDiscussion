With apologies to those who might&#39;ve seen this, and as an <br/>\noffering to those who haven&#39;t, here&#39;s a recent HEM column:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to Raise a Respected Child <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly says the ice cream we have in the freezer is too sweet. She had <br/>\nchocolate milk last night and said there was too much chocolate in it, so she <br/>\ndivided it and made chocolate milk for someone else with half of it. She <br/>\nusually prefers plain milk. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlain milk tastes WAY better if it&#39;s your choice than if does when it&#39;s plain <br/>\nbecause someone else wouldn&#39;t let you put chocolate in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout free choice, how can a person choose what is plain and good? <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling begins with a choice between going to school or not. How many <br/>\nmillions of people are never given that choice? <br/>\n<br/>\nNext is the choice between &quot;doing school-work&quot; or not. Sometimes new <br/>\nunschooling parents are hoping that holding their breath and waiting might <br/>\nlead to children studying a curriculum, just as the <br/>\nmathematically-allegorical monkeys might type Hamlet. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the success-bearing phase, unschoolers stop looking for Hamlet or even for <br/>\nEnglish history. But knowing that Ian Holm, who plays Bilbo, plays Polonius <br/>\nwith Glenn Close in a Mel Gibson movie causes it to be worth a look for lots <br/>\nof people. And he was Fluellen in Kenneth Brannagh&#39;s Henry V, too. If they <br/>\nwatch Hamlet or Henry V because of Lord of the Rings, is that like chocolate <br/>\nmilk, or like plain milk? If they don&#39;t watch Hamlet yet, or ever, that&#39;s <br/>\nfine too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most peaceful unschooling families have loosed the ropes that held <br/>\nlearning at the dock. They have developed faith in the idea that humans learn <br/>\nbest in freedom. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps it&#39;s just a pretty truism, about unschooling families. Maybe it is as <br/>\nreal as granite. Here are some other patterns for your consideration, though: <br/>\nUnschooling families with young children often fear for the neighbors to <br/>\n&quot;test them&quot; and find them wild or &quot;behind.&quot; Unschooling families with older <br/>\nchildren politely try to hide their smugness at the positive responses of <br/>\nothers to their older unschoolers. How does that change come about? <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are traditional dialogs adults have with stranger-children. They ask <br/>\nwhat school they go to. They ask whether the child likes his teacher, and <br/>\nwhat his favorite subject is. My children haven&#39;t gotten past the first two <br/>\nquestions, because if &quot;I don&#39;t go to school&quot; doesn&#39;t stump the interviewer, <br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t have a teacher&quot; usually does. And so an adult who succeeds in having <br/>\na conversation with an unschooled child finds himself speaking with a person, <br/>\nand not &quot;a student,&quot; not &quot;a child.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some, this is their first real conversation with a person who isn&#39;t grown <br/>\nto adulthood. My kids are used to being the first, in that way. They&#39;re used <br/>\nto the look in people&#39;s eyes when they realize that here is a child who has <br/>\nsomething to talk about and who will confidently and guilelessly speak. <br/>\nHow does that confidence arise? <br/>\n<br/>\nI really believe unschooling works best when parents trust a child&#39;s <br/>\npersonhood, his intelligence, his instincts, his potential to be mature and <br/>\ncalm. Take any of that away, and the child becomes smaller and powerless to <br/>\nsome degree. <br/>\n<br/>\nGive them power and respect, and they become respected and powerful. <br/>\nIs it just that simple? That a parent can GIVE a child power and respect? Can <br/>\na parent give a child freedom? <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the freedom to choose what they eat, my children have bypassed sweets <br/>\nmore times than I could have counted, and eaten hearty, real food. I saw <br/>\nthose choices working before they were old enough to go to school, or not to <br/>\ngo to school. They had all the food they wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the freedom to choose to stay up or to go to bed, I saw toddlers ask to <br/>\ngo to bed because they were tired, and then saw them go to sleep smiling, and <br/>\nwake up happy. They had all the waking they wanted, and all the sleep they <br/>\nwanted, instead of feeling deprived of either. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf my childhood, I remember tears over pancakes. EAT THEM NOW. I didn&#39;t eat <br/>\nthem again for fifteen years, after that forced-pancake day. Was that good <br/>\nfor nutrition? Discipline? Love? Respect? No, it was destructive. I remember <br/>\nbeing forced at school and at home to drink milk. Was one glass enough? Then <br/>\nis half a glass enough? Will a child drink not one drop more than he HAS to? <br/>\nIs milk better than peace? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor many children, information is treated like cold pancakes. Skills are <br/>\nforced like too-warm milk. <br/>\nWhat if hot pancakes, served with a smile, would taste really good with milk? <br/>\nWhat magic happens when it&#39;s fully acceptable for a child to say &quot;No thanks&quot; <br/>\nto hot pancakes? <br/>\n<br/>\nNeediness expresses itself differently with different kids. Abundance <br/>\nexpresses itself similarly in all. <br/>\nNeediness creates various interpersonal problems, health difficulties, <br/>\npsychological stress and sorrow. Chronic neediness becomes a vacuum that <br/>\ncannot be filled. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbundance in one person provides benefits for others. A child with all the <br/>\ntrust he needs can trust others. A child with all the time he needs can share <br/>\nthat time with others. One who has freedom won&#39;t begrudge freedom in others. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost people have never known a kid who has experienced true abundance. Most <br/>\nhave never met a child who had been given a full measure of respect, so that <br/>\nthe child was respected (already) and full of respect (respectful). It is <br/>\neasy to respect someone who has that respect already, and who has so much <br/>\nthat he can spread it around to others. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn abundance of love, of confidence, of self and of freedom will create a <br/>\nflow of respect from and toward a person. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s children are Holly (11), Marty (13) and Kirby (16). They have <br/>\nnever been to school, and they eventually came to amaze the neighbors. Their <br/>\nabundance is shared with others, usually in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/respect\">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro./Taking Advantage","postDate":"1046884881","msgId":60144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNiLjM0OTQ1MTgxLjJiOTc4YzExQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60138,"nextInTopic":60145,"prevInTime":60143,"nextInTime":60145,"topicId":31053,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/5/03 9:56:18 AM, SandraDodd@aol.com writes:  And I am an excellent speller.

He has a hard time with the <br/>\nwhole philosophy of unschooling and letting go of his old mentality <br/>\nconcerning &quot;raising&quot; children. Most of the time he goes along with what I <br/>\nsuggest. Every once in a while, he&#39;ll come out with thinking out loud to me <br/>\nthat maybe the kids will end up walking all over us. Or he might suggest <br/>\nsome kind of punishment like taking something away from them. There are <br/>\ntimes in the past when he&#39;s actually stated that to one child who upset him. <br/>\nHe never followed through and we&#39;ve talked about what that does. Now his <br/>\nquestions about it all are directed at me. He was raised in a strict <br/>\nhousehold to one extent, he got spanked with spoons and belts. Then on the <br/>\nother hand, his parents were never there for him. Never attended one <br/>\nbaseball game he played in. How sad. He would go and come back to his games <br/>\nall alone. He was also a latch key kid and ended up heavy in drugs and <br/>\nalcohol. This whole unrestricted attitude is hard sometimes for him to <br/>\nunderstand. But he&#39;s starting to see we have great kids. They don&#39;t take <br/>\nadvantage of us at all. We haven&#39;t been unschooling that long, but even my <br/>\noldest at 17 doesn&#39;t walk all over us. It&#39;s the way you talk to your <br/>\nchildren and what they see and hear that matters. Does Tara clean the house <br/>\nor do the laundry? Well yeah, sometimes but most of the time it&#39;s my job. I <br/>\nhave no problem with that. She has a lot on her plate. She cooks for herself <br/>\nand sometimes does laundry and keeps her room spotless. All by her own <br/>\naccord and standards. She watches and plays with the kids and takes care of <br/>\nthe litter box. She does dishes. And anything I ask of her is done with no <br/>\nproblems. Now the younger ones don&#39;t do as much, but I really never have a <br/>\nproblem with them doing something I ask. They will ask if it can wait until <br/>\nlater sometimes. That&#39;s never a problem here. The little one of course says <br/>\nno all the time so I do what I asked of her and then just keep trying!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think respecting our children turns them into self centered adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?

The<br/>\nproblem was when dishes kept stacking up all over the living room and<br/>\nthe <br/>\nonly kids bringing them to the kitchen were our guests! I cleaned up<br/>\nafter <br/>\neveryone a few times, reminding them that I&#39;d like their dishes brought<br/>\nout <br/>\nto the kitchen so food wouldn&#39;t dry onto them.  Their friends left. They<br/>\n<br/>\ncontinued for the next two days doing pretty much nothing but video<br/>\ngames. I <br/>\ngot a little pushy today.<br/>\nThere was food all over the floor, dishes still being left even though<br/>\nI&#39;d <br/>\nrequested them to be brought out several times, blankets and pillows <br/>\neverywhere, yogurt containers half eaten all over...I LOST it! I pointed<br/>\nout how very inconsiderate they were being by expecting me to clean <br/>\nup and not lift a finger. I told them how stressed out all the mess<br/>\nmakes me <br/>\n(NO, I can&#39;t be happy in total disasters, I&#39;ve tried) and they needed to<br/>\nshut <br/>\nthe tv off and help me gain some sanity.<br/>\nThey did of course.<br/>\nBut it pissed me off that I didn&#39;t get help until I was totally<br/>\nstressed. I am fine with them being focused on their friends/video<br/>\ngames....I&#39;m fine <br/>\nwith doing most of the housework.<br/>\nBut I work outside the home, dh runs a business and we NEED help<br/>\nsometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time we have a happy flow of my requests being met<br/>\nwillingly, <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t bother them with it most of the time. And they do<br/>\nappreciate <br/>\nall the clean up I do for them. But once in a while this &quot;system&quot; fails<br/>\nme, <br/>\nor maybe I fail it.<br/>\nAnd I get really, really cranky and feel like no one cares unless I get <br/>\ncranky.<br/>\nwhich I DON&#39;T want to be.<br/>\nSo we held a meeting today to try and figure out some way to make sure <br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs get met. I&#39;m still not sure we&#39;ve got much figured out,<br/>\nbut <br/>\nwe all feel better having talked about it. :)<br/>\nI know that chore lists suck. I will not resort to that lame system<br/>\nagain.  I <br/>\nwill not dictate how the house is kept unless I just simply do it. They<br/>\nlive <br/>\nhere and have a right to decide these things too...and most of what they<br/>\ndo <br/>\nis WAY more important than cleaning.<br/>\nBut sometimes it all falls apart in chaos and I resort to &quot;We are going<br/>\nto <br/>\nget this disaster cleaned up right now, I&#39;m going crazy!!&quot;<br/>\nThey probably think I&#39;m nuts (ok, I am) but some order helps me be a lot<br/>\nmore <br/>\ncreative and fun.

But I&#39;m finding that <br/>\n I don&#39;t have the energy to do the amount of cleaning up after other <br/>\n people that it would take for me to be comfortable, anymore. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in this system theoretically, and most of the time it works fine <br/>\nhere.<br/>\nI ask, they usually help.<br/>\nBut we had a couple of tough days and I lost it.<br/>\nWe had two extra kids stay over, kids that I really, really like and love <br/>\nhaving over.<br/>\nI made food for the kids and brought it to them, they stayed on video games <br/>\nfrom afternoon to the next morning (finally falling asleep about 6am) which <br/>\nis no problem.<br/>\nThey were pretty quiet while I slept and did their own thing.<br/>\nThe problem was when dishes kept stacking up all over the living room and the <br/>\nonly kids bringing them to the kitchen were our guests! I cleaned up after <br/>\neveryone a few times, reminding them that I&#39;d like their dishes brought out <br/>\nto the kitchen so food wouldn&#39;t dry onto them.  Their friends left. They <br/>\ncontinued for the next two days doing pretty much nothing but video games. I <br/>\ngot a little pushy today.<br/>\nThere was food all over the floor, dishes still being left even though I&#39;d <br/>\nrequested them to be brought out several times, blankets and pillows <br/>\neverywhere, yogurt containers half eaten all over...I LOST it!<br/>\nI pointed out how very inconsiderate they were being by expecting me to clean <br/>\nup and not lift a finger. I told them how stressed out all the mess makes me <br/>\n(NO, I can&#39;t be happy in total disasters, I&#39;ve tried) and they needed to shut <br/>\nthe tv off and help me gain some sanity.<br/>\nThey did of course.<br/>\nBut it pissed me off that I didn&#39;t get help until I was totally stressed.<br/>\nI am fine with them being focused on their friends/video games....I&#39;m fine <br/>\nwith doing most of the housework.<br/>\nBut I work outside the home, dh runs a business and we NEED help sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time we have a happy flow of my requests being met willingly, <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t bother them with it most of the time. And they do appreciate <br/>\nall the clean up I do for them. But once in a while this &quot;system&quot; fails me, <br/>\nor maybe I fail it.<br/>\nAnd I get really, really cranky and feel like no one cares unless I get <br/>\ncranky.<br/>\nwhich I DON&#39;T want to be.<br/>\nSo we held a meeting today to try and figure out some way to make sure <br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs get met. I&#39;m still not sure we&#39;ve got much figured out, but <br/>\nwe all feel better having talked about it. :)<br/>\nI know that chore lists suck. I will not resort to that lame system again.  I <br/>\nwill not dictate how the house is kept unless I just simply do it. They live <br/>\nhere and have a right to decide these things too...and most of what they do <br/>\nis WAY more important than cleaning.<br/>\nBut sometimes it all falls apart in chaos and I resort to &quot;We are going to <br/>\nget this disaster cleaned up right now, I&#39;m going crazy!!&quot;<br/>\nThey probably think I&#39;m nuts (ok, I am) but some order helps me be a lot more <br/>\ncreative and fun. If it helps me be a better Mom, that&#39;s good for all of us.<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t mean they have to keep the house the way I like it, that&#39;s my <br/>\njob.<br/>\nBut if bringing dishes out or at least letting me know when food spills helps <br/>\nme be sane, they should learn to think about that.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an issue most days, but I&#39;d like to find some way to avoid the <br/>\noccasional meltdown. sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.

I have seven children...five boys, two <br/>\ngirls ranging in age from 15 to 2.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been through the whole range of homeschooling styles, but I started <br/>\nout as an unschooler many years ago.  In fact, when I was introduced to <br/>\nh/sing, I thought Holt was all there was.  I remember remarking to my hubby <br/>\nafter we&#39;d read articles about h/sing in the newspaper...&quot;Do you believe that <br/>\npeople actually set up little schools in their own homes...then why don&#39;t <br/>\nthey just send the kids to school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, somehow, maybe it was the number of kids we had, insecurity, health <br/>\nproblems (I&#39;ve got a ton of excuses), we got rigid.  Really rigid.  And I was <br/>\none of those h/ser&#39;s who was setting up the little school and ringing the <br/>\nbell and scheduling my kids right down to when they were supposed to use the <br/>\njohn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I defended myself by saying...but look what they&#39;re learning...and the <br/>\nrelatives are so impressed.  But, at the same time, our home life was falling <br/>\napart.  The kids were always tense.  I was ALWAYS tense.  I felt like my life <br/>\nwas slipping away...I never even got outside because I was so busy making my <br/>\nhome into a school and then just trying to keep my home from falling apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to exaggerate here.  It&#39;s really been stressful, and always a <br/>\nvoice nagged at me...but you know another way!  And I did try, different <br/>\ntimes, to respond.  I joined other unschooling lists, attended a conference, <br/>\nbut I wasn&#39;t ready to get out of my &quot;safety zone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;ve realized that I have to.  It&#39;s no longer become important that I do <br/>\nit or not because of what others think.  My house has literally been falling <br/>\napart from the stress of trying to keep up this &quot;system&quot; that none of us <br/>\ntruly believed in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the weeks since I&#39;ve come back here and read through my old, dusty copies <br/>\nof Holt and other things, I&#39;ve seen changes at home.  I&#39;d like to report that <br/>\neverything is hunky-dory, but that&#39;s not true.  But, I saw my husband laugh <br/>\nwith the kids tonight and tell them silly riddles.  And I took my nine year <br/>\nold and his brother to Wal-Mart tonight to buy Star Wars toys which they <br/>\ndon&#39;t need, but love to play with.  I played ball outside with my kids <br/>\nyesterday.  I saw the full moon with them tonight.  I&#39;ve gone for a walk with <br/>\nmy dh four nights in a row.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo wrap this up, I want to say thanks.  For all the straightforward, <br/>\njolt-me-out-of-my-reverie type comments and for the &quot;be easy on <br/>\nyourself...one step at a time&quot; comments.  They have all been helpful to me.  <br/>\nEven the discussion about unschooling, which some of you deemed a fight, has <br/>\nbeen fascinating for me, and really helped me to clarify things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I will have frequent questions, doubts and pulling my hair out.  <br/>\nI know I&#39;ll be able to sound them out here.

I&#39;m a self-taught jewelry artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have been unschoolers from birth, figuring out what that little<br/>\nscooter thing was and could do on their own, and all of the other learning<br/>\nchildren begin at birth.  I can honestly say that they have figured out all<br/>\non their own which colors are which (with NO QUIZZES, imagine that), what<br/>\ndifferent animals are, how to count, etc.  It has been incredibly<br/>\neye-opening for us because I never realized just how early the inane quizzes<br/>\nand tests start (example - grandma: what is your name, how old are you, what<br/>\ncolor is this, and on and on).  Okay, yes, I&#39;m a hardcore unschooler.  I<br/>\nalways resisted forced learning myself and absolutely abhor tests, so it is<br/>\nreally personal for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are pretty isolated and my son is needing more challenging and<br/>\nstimulating things in his life.  I am always looking for activities, etc. to<br/>\ndo which will challenge him in his new learning phase (he is beginning to<br/>\nlearn letters/words in a very holistic approach, is unwittingly doing basic<br/>\naddition and subtraction and has even showed an understanding of<br/>\nmultiplication in our daily lives, and has an incredible vocabulary (english<br/>\nand spanish) to rival most adults.  He is just very ripe and starting to<br/>\nshow frustration because he is not stimulated enough in our daily lives.  I<br/>\nam looking for something to stimulate my creativity so that I can make a<br/>\nmore stimulating, learning rich environment for us. (any and all suggestions<br/>\nappreciated!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also looking for a good place to go to learn specifically about state<br/>\nmandated homeschooling laws.
