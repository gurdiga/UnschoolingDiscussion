I know I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get it quite right, but here is the jist of it:<br/>\n&gt; There was a very poor woman in some country in<br/>\n&gt; central or South America. She<br/>\n&gt; was talking to a wealthy, well educated man at her<br/>\n&gt; church that was visiting<br/>\n&gt; from America. He had given a sermon on the<br/>\n&gt; importance of bettering one&#39;s lot<br/>\n&gt; in life by making the best use of whatever resources<br/>\n&gt; you currently have<br/>\n&gt; available. She spoke to him afterwards and wanted to<br/>\n&gt; know how she could do<br/>\n&gt; that when she didn&#39;t even know how to read. He told<br/>\n&gt; her that she could learn<br/>\n&gt; to read if she wanted to. He also asked her what she<br/>\n&gt; did in her free time<br/>\n&gt; and she said that she sat on her stoop and watched<br/>\n&gt; the ants. He told her<br/>\n&gt; that she should learn about those ants and her stoop<br/>\n&gt; then. So, she found<br/>\n&gt; someone to teach her to read. Then she found out<br/>\n&gt; what kind of ants crawled<br/>\n&gt; on her stoop. She studied all about them which led<br/>\n&gt; to her studying about<br/>\n&gt; other types of ants. She wrote to this man to update<br/>\n&gt; him on her progress<br/>\n&gt; each time she learned something new. She also asked<br/>\n&gt; around to find out just<br/>\n&gt; how her stoop was made and what it was made out of.<br/>\n&gt; This led to a study of<br/>\n&gt; bricks and different types of building<br/>\n&gt; constructions. She eventually went on<br/>\n&gt; to write books about the things she had learned and<br/>\n&gt; making quite a bit of<br/>\n&gt; money.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I may have the details not quite right, but the jist<br/>\n&gt; is that learning about<br/>\n&gt; one thing kept leading to learning about something<br/>\n&gt; else. And a woman who<br/>\n&gt; thought that she couldn&#39;t learn anything or make<br/>\n&gt; anything better out of her<br/>\n&gt; life was able to do so.
