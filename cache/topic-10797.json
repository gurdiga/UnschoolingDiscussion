Some of my kids are older ( 2 <br/>\n12 yr olds and a 16 yr old) and there are times when we do more with other <br/>\npeople.  But they actually love being home, being able to read, walk around <br/>\noutside, listen to music they like, etc.  I have felt guilty that maybe I was <br/>\nkeeping them too isolated at times but as they get older, I am so encouraged <br/>\nby the views they&#39;ve developed, the way they think, etc.  They really are <br/>\nTHINKERS!  We still have two younger ones, ages 8 and 3, so we&#39;ll see how it <br/>\ngoes with them but I&#39;m hopeful now seeing how their older brothers are doing.<br/>\n     <br/>\n     Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall","from":"&quot;Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall&quot; &lt;tn-k4of5@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UgkTJ-K_aAi7x-SkoLSscig-I82tuPeFjhrCTsR26BkLpVjKg_XrhjJ0S4f6sckQ1t2lWJW7C0TN1p4nCi_BIF3YHt5-C9tDFNmSiK7WTPsV47q5Q1b6rpy5giu0Pw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE:[Unschooling-dotcom] homesty","postDate":"963005610","msgId":10797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzA3MjEzMy5PQUEyNTUzMUBtYWlsMTcuYmlnbWFpbGJveC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10902,"prevInTime":10796,"nextInTime":10798,"topicId":10797,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think we have tended to become isolationists with our children, so that we can instil in them the values we need without a lot of interference from needing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1219696940\">I think we have tended to become isolationists with our children, so that we can instil in them the values we need without a lot of interference from needing to conform to group social pressures from well meaning friends and family.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;cheers,<br/>\n&gt;Beverley <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have too.
