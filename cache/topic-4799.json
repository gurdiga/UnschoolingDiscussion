I always wonder how any adult can say they don&#39;t like <br/>\nkids; it&#39;s like saying they don&#39;t like humans or themselves.  A lot of adults <br/>\nseem to want kids to behave like miniature adults.  Even those who remember <br/>\ntheir childhoods don&#39;t always apply it to the kids now.  They&#39;ll tell stories <br/>\nabout things they did or adults who they thought were mean and then get mad <br/>\nat a kid for doing something very similar to what they did AND end up acting <br/>\nvery similar to the adult in their story whom they disliked as a kid.  <br/>\n    Too often we don&#39;t see kids as full human beings.  We focus too much on <br/>\nhow they affect us at any given moment.  Of course, we do that with adults, <br/>\ntoo, but kids have far less power than adults so they&#39;re much more apt to be <br/>\nvictimized by this.  When we deal with a particular kid, maybe we need to <br/>\nfocus on remembering how we felt at that age, what we were like, and then <br/>\nkeep relating it back to that kid.  <br/>\n    I remember when I was a kid, there were certain adults who I found it <br/>\nimpossible to ever envision them being young.  It wasn&#39;t because of their <br/>\nage.  My grandmother looked plenty old to me but when I listened to her <br/>\nstories or played games with her, it was easy to imagine her young.  But <br/>\nthere were some people who seemed so mean, so lacking in any sense of humor, <br/>\nso rule oriented, that it seemed like they must have been born that way.  I <br/>\nremember those feelings a lot and when I do, I always think, &quot;Ugh!  I hope <br/>\nI&#39;m not being that way now!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bonknit@xxx.xxx","from":"Bonknit@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"oL8n9G8SCUU0kO4I6VJ9xc9p27sPMAEKND5um19-gCXnzgqstVdYnYt7FChiR7nXDw1-nCiC","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Goddard College:  Vermont College","postDate":"943476138","msgId":4813,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTIuNDgxMy45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4811,"nextInTopic":4814,"prevInTime":4812,"nextInTime":4814,"topicId":4799,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/24/99 3:34:52 PM Eastern Standard Time, LASaliger@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1112606625\">In a message dated 11/24/99 3:34:52 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LASaliger@...\">LASaliger@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We were unschooling most of the year before but the difference is that now <br/>\nwe <br/>\n embrace it instead of feeling vaguely guilty about it!   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHELP!!!
