I always felt that my life<br/>\n&gt; WAS a mother. I&#39;ve had a similar discussion with my sis-in-laws and it<br/>\n&gt; shocked me that some people feel it&#39;s their right to be able to &quot;unload&quot;<br/>\n&gt; their children on the schools. I truly hope that I will instill in my<br/>\n&gt; children a sense of duty when it comes to family and move away from the<br/>\n&gt; selfishness that seems so prevalent today (even if it is disguised as<br/>\n&gt; financial need. You know,&quot; I need to send the kids to school so I can work&quot;).<br/>\n&gt; Blessings. Lori in TX<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree and just to restate, I am speaking of parents who are &quot;unloading&quot; the kids on someone else.� Not the countless parents who are providing the best home and care environment for their kids regardless of stay at home status or not.� I do applaud those parents who work outside the home and still manage to give parenting their all--I do not know how they manage it, but they do every single day:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As much as I love being a SAHM, I would not force it on anyone else and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; like seeing it used as a wedge between mothers who are all probably just<br/>\n&gt; trying to do their best -- as they perceive it and as they are able.� I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; trying to attack you personally Lori, or anyone else who agrees with you, I<br/>\n&gt; just think it is unnecessary to perpetuate this divisive issue between<br/>\n&gt; mothers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nance<br/>\n&gt; �<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enough of my rambling and thoughts.� Have a great day and smile.<br/>\nAndi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2266,"nextTopicId":2271}}
