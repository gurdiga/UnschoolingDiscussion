Homeschoolers <br/>\nprobab;ly couldn&#39;t pull this off because there probably aren&#39;t enough of <br/>\nus--and more importantly, we could never agree on the logistics.  ;)<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren Cause Earthquake in Giant Jump<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Michael Holden<br/>\nReuters<br/>\n<br/>\nLONDON (Sept. 6) - Around a million British school children succeeded in <br/>\ncausing an earthquake Friday, jumping up and down simultaneously in the <br/>\nworld&#39;s largest scientific experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThousands of schools around Britain were asked to send children out into the <br/>\nplaygrounds at 11 a.m. local time to jump up and down for a minute in hopes <br/>\nof creating a measurable quake.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrganizers of the Giant Jump event, held to mark the launch of the <br/>\ngovernment&#39;s Science Year, said it had been a success.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;We&#39;re almost sure we had a million people out there jumping for us. We got <br/>\nsome kind of result at every single seismometer around the country,&#39;&#39; Nigel <br/>\nPain, director of Science Year, told Reuters.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;We generated something like a hundredth of a serious earthquake -- that&#39;s <br/>\nnot an enormous amount of energy but it&#39;s significant.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exact number of people taking part would have to be verified, but he said <br/>\nit was an unofficial world record.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly estimates suggested 75,000 tons of energy had been released during the <br/>\nminute of jumping.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;Because it&#39;s dissipated across the whole country it didn&#39;t do very much <br/>\ndamage. But drop that in one spot and it would have caused quite a big hole <br/>\nin the ground,&#39;&#39; he added.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the next two weeks the results from around the country will be analyzed <br/>\nto see if the event registered on the Richter scale.<br/>\n<br/>\nScientists said a million children with an average weight of 110 pounds <br/>\njumping 20 times in a minute would release two billion joules of energy and <br/>\ntrigger the equivalent of an earthquake measuring three on the Richter scale.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe event has also attracted serious attention from scientists including the <br/>\nAtomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), which maintains Britain&#39;s nuclear <br/>\nwarheads.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately the world didn&#39;t split in two as one of the children surveyed <br/>\nbefore the event believed would happen, nor did the Earth leave the Sun&#39;s <br/>\norbit as feared by another.<br/>\n<br/>\nA third came up with a more likely, if less exciting scenario: &#39;&#39;There will <br/>\nbe lots of hospital visits from people with sprained ankles.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24967,"nextTopicId":25148}}
