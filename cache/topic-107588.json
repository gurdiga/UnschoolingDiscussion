Maybe you talked a bit about <br/>\ngenetics when you were guessing how many puppies would look like the <br/>\nmom and how many would look like the dad.  Genetics is a chapter too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been awhile since I read it, but I think in the book <br/>\nHomeschooling our Children Unschooling Ourselves she talks about her <br/>\nson being into fly fishing and how they wrote that up for biology.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHas he done any gardening, or watched you do gardening?  Or does he <br/>\nhave any other pets?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one thing I&#39;d use if I were doing a transcript for my kids and <br/>\nhad to explain what we did for biology:  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor awhile we had a lot of animal teeth things connecting together in <br/>\nneat ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, my son  and I were at Hershey Park and a groundhog boldly came <br/>\nup to us begging for food.  I&#39;ve never seen a groundhog before that <br/>\nwasn&#39;t dead on the side of the road. &lt;grin&gt;  So we threw him a pizza <br/>\ncrust and watched him eat it and noticed that he ate just the way our <br/>\nhamsters eat.  We wondered if that is something that all rodents have <br/>\nin common.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral days later my husband came home with animal teeth that he <br/>\nfound on the side of the road at work, and thought we might enjoy <br/>\nseeing them.  He didn&#39;t know what they were, but he guessed groundhog <br/>\nbecause he had seen a dead groundhog on the side of the road about <br/>\nthe same place a long time ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral days later we went to my parents&#39; house and played with their <br/>\nnew pet bunny.  We wondered if rabbits were rodents too, and went <br/>\nhome and looked that up online.  We found out that they&#39;re not <br/>\nrodents because they have extra teeth, and found out that all rodents <br/>\nteeth look the same.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I thought of those teeth that dh had brought home, and I <br/>\npointed out to the kids that they didn&#39;t look like the pictures of <br/>\nrodent teeth we were seeing online.  I opened up the mouth of one of <br/>\nour hamsters, and showed them the teeth.  They looked nothing like <br/>\ndh&#39;s roadkill teeth.   Then I opened up our dog&#39;s mouth (Isn&#39;t it <br/>\nnice how my pets tolerate me? &lt;grin&gt;) and we looked at his teeth.  It <br/>\nwas a match!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat led to a discussion of what kind of animals might have been <br/>\nkilled in that area that had teeth like our dog.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral days later we were driving in a residential area and saw a <br/>\nskunk dead on the side of the road.  It had just been killed.  We <br/>\npulled over and got out to look at it.  It&#39;s mouth was open and we <br/>\ngot a good look at its teeth and my daughter pointed out that his <br/>\nteeth look just like our cat&#39;s teeth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also noticed that it hardly smelled at all, not like skunks <br/>\nusually smell when they get hit by a car. So I said maybe it was <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s pet and had been descented, and told her about a relative <br/>\nthat used to have a pet skunk.  When she got home she used google to <br/>\nfind out what would be involved in having a pet skunk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not getting a pet skunk but she does want to get 2 pet rats and <br/>\ntrain them to do things like mazes.  She just won an auction on ebay <br/>\nfor a cage, and she&#39;s been reading lots of stuff online about having <br/>\npet rats. She looked up breeders online and as soon as her cage comes <br/>\nin the mail plans on calling them to see when she can buy her rats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a transcript I could write about animal classification <br/>\ndefinitely.  Maybe something with digestion because of the different <br/>\nkinds of teeth different animals have and what they&#39;re used for. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe could write lots of other stuff about pets too, since my kids tend <br/>\nto want a lot of pets. ;)  Like that our pet turtle ate every other <br/>\nliving thing, plant or animal, that we put in the tank with him, and <br/>\nthat he just keeps getting bigger every year. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;He is very automotive minded right now(since he was 8) and there is <br/>\njust no way I can count that as a mollusk.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we talking about a highschool transcript in order to meet the <br/>\nrequirements of the law or a transcipt for impressing a college so <br/>\nthat you can gain admission? <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I thought you were talking about a college transcript and I <br/>\nwas going to ask if he wants to go to college if he&#39;s really into <br/>\nautomotive stuff, but later I see you seem to be talking about <br/>\nhighschool credits? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of anything automotive that would be biology, but I bet <br/>\nyou could come up with lots of stuff that he does with cars that <br/>\nwould be other branches of science.  Maybe chemistry too, if you had <br/>\nto figure out which detergents best cleaned his greasy work clothes. <br/>\n&lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do I skip the ones he refuses and go on? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What do you mean by skip?  Skip as in not showing the highschool that <br/>\nyou did anything for that subject?  I wouldn&#39;t do that if it&#39;s a <br/>\nlegal requirement and you could get in trouble for not showing it. <br/>\nThat would be something to discuss on a state homeschool list.  But <br/>\nyou could find things that the school understands to be biology. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you gone anywhere like a science museum?  Science museums tend <br/>\nto have things that include many different branches of science.  If <br/>\nyou look on your science museum&#39;s website you&#39;ll probably find that <br/>\nsome of the exhibits have something to do with biology.  What about a <br/>\nzoo?  Aquarium?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do in my portfolio, and I&#39;m in a different state (PA) so I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if this is anything like what you could do, is I <br/>\nwrite &quot;Some of our favorite educational activities from this school <br/>\nyear&quot; at the top of a paper and then just start putting in stuff that <br/>\nmight impress them.  I don&#39;t point out that we didn&#39;t use a textbook--<br/>\nI don&#39;t tell them what we didn&#39;t do, I tell them what we did do.  In <br/>\nour case we did a &quot;unit study&quot; on animals.  In your case you did too, <br/>\njust a different kind.  I bet if you think of all the conversations <br/>\nyou had about your dog having puppies you could come up with lots of <br/>\nneat things to write about.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do I find pond water and suggest he look at while sitting in a car? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nlol!  I don&#39;t think that would really benefit anyone.  It might lead <br/>\nyour son to believe that you&#39;re nuts though. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut did he see a pond this year?  What other bodies of water has he <br/>\nseen? Has he seen a river, lake, ocean, stream?  I bet he noticed <br/>\nsome differences.  You could say that as part of your ecology study <br/>\nyou did a field trip to observe different bodies of water.  Did he <br/>\nwade in the creek?  Catch any minnows or crayfish in the creek? Find <br/>\nany seashells at the ocean?   Did he bring them home?  That&#39;s <br/>\nobserving specimens. ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92710795,"authorName":"InnerLight Academy","from":"InnerLight Academy &lt;innerlightacademy@...&gt;","profile":"innerlightacademy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[UnschoolingDiscussion]keeping credits?","postDate":"1122940812","msgId":107644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwODAyMDAwMDEyLjM0NzI4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxMjAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyRUVBMENBLjEwNTA4MDRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":107642,"nextInTopic":107646,"prevInTime":107643,"nextInTime":107645,"topicId":107588,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, We are life long homeschoolers(10 official years) and on our 2nd year as unschoolers.

But I&#39;ve noticed it is<br/>\n&gt; usually the last thing my kids yield to when tired and upset. Fluffing<br/>\n&gt; pillows means nothing to them.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have a different experience here.   Bed has never, ever been a<br/>\nthing that <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to do with being tired and sleepy.   Bed is like<br/>\nfood--comfort <br/>\n&gt; when one&#39;s body needs it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other night Kirby was playing World of Warcraft and another teen<br/>\nbragged <br/>\n&gt; that he&#39;d been awake since the morning before (nearly 40 hours at<br/>\nthat point) <br/>\n&gt; and Kirby said he loved to sleep, that sleep&#39;s great and he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nstay up <br/>\n&gt; just to stay up (or some such, I can&#39;t remember exactly now).   He<br/>\nsaid the <br/>\n&gt; other kid said (and this to a group, over headphones) &quot;You&#39;re going<br/>\nto be the most <br/>\n&gt; boring guy in college.&quot;     I remember people in college staying up<br/>\njust <br/>\n&gt; because they could, too, not so much because they were involved in<br/>\nmusic or <br/>\n&gt; conversation and forgot the time, but from watching the clock and<br/>\nbeing awake for <br/>\n&gt; its own sake.   My kids have never had a reason to do that.   They<br/>\nknow what <br/>\n&gt; sleep is good for and they do it voluntarily.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-So a suggestion to &quot;Go to bed until you are less cranky&quot; would sound<br/>\n&gt; coercive in their ears, like punishment. For us, once the child is<br/>\n&gt; cranky, it&#39;s too late to suggest sleep. At that point, we watch TV<br/>\n&gt; with them or go for a drive.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To my kids it wouldn&#39;t sound coercive.   It would be the same as &quot;maybe <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re hungry&quot; as a suggestion for why they were cranky.     <br/>\nAnother La Leche <br/>\n&gt; League quick-trick was when a child is crying, HALT.:    hungry?  <br/>\nangry?   <br/>\n&gt; lonely?   tired?       None of those are crimes or punishments.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-Yet somehow this suggestion of &quot;go to bed&quot; is seen not as coercive,<br/>\n&gt; categorically... I want to know why.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Because it&#39;s a suggestion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=- Somehow saying that sleep is good<br/>\n&gt; for the child is enough. Well, lots of parents would say math books<br/>\n&gt; are good for children too.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kirby had a math book when he took a math class.   At that point he<br/>\nchose <br/>\n&gt; one.   He chooses to sleep at least once in just about every 24 hour<br/>\nperiod, too. <br/>\n&gt;   And when he&#39;s tired is when he needs sleep, but we no longer have to <br/>\n&gt; suggest it to him at all.   Sometimes when he was little it was one<br/>\nof several <br/>\n&gt; suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-Now Sheila is being told that she is defending her kids obnoxious<br/>\n&gt; behavior when she continues to share the express nature of the<br/>\n&gt; conflict they had in the store (sticking out tongue and kicking).-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When things continue for five or fifteen minutes without change or<br/>\ncessation, <br/>\n&gt; something isn&#39;t working.   When suggestions people make are rejected <br/>\n&gt; repeatedly, something is being defended.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=- The suggestion offered of what to say to the child: &quot;Stop it or<br/>\nyou&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; coming with me next time.&quot;-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If someone (of whatever age) is unprepared to behave well in public,<br/>\ntaking <br/>\n&gt; him out in public for a repeat isn&#39;t the best next move.

And Marty is helped by it.   If Marty&#39;s communications needed to be <br/>\nsaved to be directed at Kirby, he wouldn&#39;t have had the opportunity to discuss <br/>\nit candidly.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If a child is too angry to sit down, he stands. If there is a need for<br/>\na few moments to regroup emotionally, of course we give it. But we<br/>\ndon&#39;t just leave it alone or until tomorrow.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never just left anything alone or til tomorrow, so the comparison seems <br/>\nto be to something that no one here recommended.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If the cranky child refused to go to bed or continued to whine and<br/>\ncry, what then?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOther suggestions would be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n-= and one of the<br/>\nsuggestions is to tell the child &quot;Go to bed and I&#39;ll hold you in the<br/>\nmorning when you aren&#39;t so cranky.&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t &quot;go to bed or else,&quot; it was &quot;maybe you should go to bed,&quot; or &quot;if <br/>\nyou&#39;re going to launch yourself on the floor, maybe you&#39;re tired, so let&#39;s do <br/>\nthis holding and rocking on your bed so if you launch you&#39;re in a soft place.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-<br/>\nCertainly sleep is a good idea when cranky. But I&#39;ve noticed it is<br/>\nusually the last thing my kids yield to when tired and upset. Fluffing<br/>\npillows means nothing to them.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a different experience here.   Bed has never, ever been a thing that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to do with being tired and sleepy.   Bed is like food--comfort <br/>\nwhen one&#39;s body needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night Kirby was playing World of Warcraft and another teen bragged <br/>\nthat he&#39;d been awake since the morning before (nearly 40 hours at that point) <br/>\nand Kirby said he loved to sleep, that sleep&#39;s great and he doesn&#39;t stay up <br/>\njust to stay up (or some such, I can&#39;t remember exactly now).   He said the <br/>\nother kid said (and this to a group, over headphones) &quot;You&#39;re going to be the most <br/>\nboring guy in college.&quot;     I remember people in college staying up just <br/>\nbecause they could, too, not so much because they were involved in music or <br/>\nconversation and forgot the time, but from watching the clock and being awake for <br/>\nits own sake.   My kids have never had a reason to do that.   They know what <br/>\nsleep is good for and they do it voluntarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So a suggestion to &quot;Go to bed until you are less cranky&quot; would sound<br/>\ncoercive in their ears, like punishment. For us, once the child is<br/>\ncranky, it&#39;s too late to suggest sleep. At that point, we watch TV<br/>\nwith them or go for a drive.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my kids it wouldn&#39;t sound coercive.   It would be the same as &quot;maybe <br/>\nyou&#39;re hungry&quot; as a suggestion for why they were cranky.      Another La Leche <br/>\nLeague quick-trick was when a child is crying, HALT.:    hungry?   angry?   <br/>\nlonely?   tired?       None of those are crimes or punishments.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Yet somehow this suggestion of &quot;go to bed&quot; is seen not as coercive,<br/>\ncategorically... I want to know why.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it&#39;s a suggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Somehow saying that sleep is good<br/>\nfor the child is enough. Well, lots of parents would say math books<br/>\nare good for children too.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby had a math book when he took a math class.   At that point he chose <br/>\none.   He chooses to sleep at least once in just about every 24 hour period, too. <br/>\n  And when he&#39;s tired is when he needs sleep, but we no longer have to <br/>\nsuggest it to him at all.   Sometimes when he was little it was one of several <br/>\nsuggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Now Sheila is being told that she is defending her kids obnoxious<br/>\nbehavior when she continues to share the express nature of the<br/>\nconflict they had in the store (sticking out tongue and kicking).-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen things continue for five or fifteen minutes without change or cessation, <br/>\nsomething isn&#39;t working.   When suggestions people make are rejected <br/>\nrepeatedly, something is being defended.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- The suggestion offered of what to say to the child: &quot;Stop it or you&#39;re <br/>\nnot<br/>\ncoming with me next time.&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone (of whatever age) is unprepared to behave well in public, taking <br/>\nhim out in public for a repeat isn&#39;t the best next move.   If someone is too <br/>\nloud in a theatre or tells what&#39;s going to happen in a movie, I wouldn&#39;t take <br/>\nhim with me to a movie the next time (and maybe not ever again), but FIRST I <br/>\nwould ask him to be quieter, and ask him not to discuss what&#39;s going to happen.   <br/>\nIf he started hitting me, I wouldn&#39;t talk to him for five minutes about it.   <br/>\nI would not be there to be hit within SECONDS.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetting children be abusive to mom or each other isn&#39;t unschooling.

That takes courage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, the question (perhaps by someone else, I don&#39;t have time<br/>\nto reread the whole thread) of what to do with siblings who don&#39;t get<br/>\nalong grew out of this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI shared a practice that has worked well for our family: sitting<br/>\ntogether on the couch to discuss what went wrong and how to resolve it<br/>\npeacefully, with all parties feeling heard and a part of determining<br/>\nhow to negotiate for what they want in the future without resorting to<br/>\nmean-spirited communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got told that it would feel like torture and coercion to the poster.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet a child can be told to breathe, to tell others to breathe when<br/>\nfeeling upset and that is seen as non-coercive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, we have a principle that unkind speech will be addressed<br/>\nwhen it happens--in order to protect kids from feeling tortured by<br/>\nmean speech. This princple has worked extremely well for us. Our kids<br/>\njust don&#39;t fight hardly at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not just a principle we apply to them either. They have held us<br/>\nto the same standards. We&#39;ve stopped what we&#39;re doing and have sat<br/>\ndown to really hear the perspective of the offended one as well<br/>\n(parent-child, wife-husband). It takes humility and it also makes it<br/>\nless rewarding to vent, let me tell you. You think twice if you know<br/>\nyou are accountable for mean speech.<br/>\n<br/>\nPunishment and coercion would be saying &quot;You apologize right now. You<br/>\nsit and listen to me rant at you for what you did to me&quot; That&#39;s not<br/>\nwhat happens. These are calm conversations with lots of support for<br/>\nboth parties. These discussions take time and gentleness. We offer both.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is too angry to sit down, he stands. If there is a need for<br/>\na few moments to regroup emotionally, of course we give it. But we<br/>\ndon&#39;t just leave it alone or until tomorrow. The goal is to give the<br/>\nparties involved the chance to work through the miscommunication when<br/>\nit occurs until relational peace is achieved. And it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had this practice for as long as I can remember. Our kids get<br/>\nalong great and we have clean slates between kids and parents too.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a parent would stop a kid from throwing a punch, we stop our<br/>\nkids from being mean to each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nLater in this thread, someone mentioned that her child will not accept<br/>\nany of the offered support when cranky and whiny and one of the<br/>\nsuggestions is to tell the child &quot;Go to bed and I&#39;ll hold you in the<br/>\nmorning when you aren&#39;t so cranky.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is that different than intervening in unkind speech and saying<br/>\n&quot;Come to the couch?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the cranky child refused to go to bed or continued to whine and<br/>\ncry, what then?<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly sleep is a good idea when cranky. But I&#39;ve noticed it is<br/>\nusually the last thing my kids yield to when tired and upset. Fluffing<br/>\npillows means nothing to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a suggestion to &quot;Go to bed until you are less cranky&quot; would sound<br/>\ncoercive in their ears, like punishment. For us, once the child is<br/>\ncranky, it&#39;s too late to suggest sleep. At that point, we watch TV<br/>\nwith them or go for a drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet somehow this suggestion of &quot;go to bed&quot; is seen not as coercive,<br/>\ncategorically... I want to know why. Somehow saying that sleep is good<br/>\nfor the child is enough. Well, lots of parents would say math books<br/>\nare good for children too. That hasn&#39;t been reason enough on this list<br/>\nfor expecting a child to do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Sheila is being told that she is defending her kids obnoxious<br/>\nbehavior when she continues to share the express nature of the<br/>\nconflict they had in the store (sticking out tongue and kicking). The<br/>\nsuggestion offered of what to say to the child: &quot;Stop it or you&#39;re not<br/>\ncoming with me next time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do these last two suggestions not sound like all the parents that<br/>\nare routinely criticized on this list?<br/>\n<br/>\nSending a child to bed or threatening not to bring the child with you<br/>\nnext time sound like coercive tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet after reading this list for all this time, I&#39;m thinking that it is<br/>\nthe *way* these ideas are communicated that may be different - that<br/>\nsomehow you are saying to the child, &quot;I like bringing you to the store<br/>\nwith me, but since it seems that you get bored and cranky, I think<br/>\nI&#39;ll go to the store alone next time and Daddy can watch you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe? I hope so because right now I&#39;m totally lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also a bit mystified at the lack of gentleness in helping a mom<br/>\nwho is sincerely communicating her frustrations in such a vulnerable<br/>\nway. I wouldn&#39;t think we&#39;d talk to our kids this way when they were<br/>\nhurting and frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears we are in a semantic whirlpool where it seems that what<br/>\ndefines coercion is the random impression a post creates on a poster.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107664,"nextTopicId":107695}}
