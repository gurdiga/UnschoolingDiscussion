I started homeschooling (& deschooling) them 2 years ago because my then 2nd grade son did not meet the schools reading level requirements. They told me &quot;he is above average on most of the other areas, however since he cannot read well he does not produce enough work to pass&quot;. They wanted to hold him back in 2nd grade again. No way. How boring would that be for him? And how stupid of them to think this would help him learn to read better? He was also always getting in trouble for making &quot;doodles&quot; on his worksheets instead of doing the work. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been out of the ps system for 2 years now & I am happy to report, things are going great. Since my younger two were never in school - they are fine. My oldest, who according to the ps had reading problems, is reading away!!!! He LOVES to read now - the trick was to let him work at his own pace (unschooling :o) and to let him read what he likes (Harry Potter! -- he can&#39;t put the books down!!). His doodles have improved too - he is a far better artist than anyone in the house. I bought him an M.C. Escher book & he took off from there. Had I left him in ps, we might not have discovered this talent (he surely would have still been getting in trouble for it!!!). <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a firm believer that children belong at home with Mom & Dad showing them the ropes - my son tells me all the time how he is so glad he is not going to ps anymore. If only I had realized my true feelings before he was forced through 3 years of ps. My other children are very happy too. They love being able to stay with me all day (and I feel I am very blessed to have them with me all day). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not like how things are going, you should follow your gut. You are her mother & mother knows best!  It sounds like things are pretty stressful for her (and you) -- if it continues in this way, she might start shutting down / blocking out what is bothering her. Maybe ... just a thought. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps, <br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne from Nebraska<br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lettersat3am@...\">lettersat3am@...</a>&gt; wrote:I just joined this list a couple of days ago and have been too <br/>\noverwhelmed by the abundance of posts to read everything, but this <br/>\nmessage stood out for me because I have the opposite situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 6yod, too, who is in 1st grade, but she is falling behind in <br/>\nreading.

She has been diagnosed with ADD and the school is saying she <br/>\nwill need a tutor for the summer in order to catch up to the reading <br/>\nlevel of her classmates.<br/>\n<br/>\nI considered homeschooling or unschooling when she was little and <br/>\ndecided to put her in public schools because it was the easy route. I <br/>\nfigured if it didn&#39;t work, I could always change tactics later. Well, <br/>\nit&#39;s not working. I want my daughter to learn to read at her own pace. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want her to feel there is something wrong with her because she&#39;s <br/>\nnot meeting her school&#39;s expectations. She&#39;s not dumb by any means, and <br/>\nI&#39;m worried that if she continues in public school, she will begin to <br/>\nfeel that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe loves to read and write when it&#39;s on her own terms, usually in <br/>\nconjunction with some art project that she has come up with, but she <br/>\ndreads the homework from school. I&#39;m not sure I can get through the rest <br/>\nof the school year without losing my mind. I&#39;m tired of struggling with <br/>\nher every night to do her homework. I&#39;m tired of struggling with her <br/>\nevery morning to get ready for school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want to stop; I want out of the stress. I want to get the public <br/>\nschool environment out of our house, out of our family life. I want to <br/>\nlove my kids for who they are and I want to be able to stop focussing on <br/>\nwho they aren&#39;t. I find myself getting so aggravated by the whole <br/>\nsituation that sometimes I actually wish for medication that might help <br/>\nmy daughter pay attention to what the school wants her to pay attention <br/>\nto. When I find myself wanting to medicate her, which is the last place <br/>\nI want to go, I know something major has to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that life will teach her what she needs to know. I hate to see <br/>\nher love for learning disappear. So I&#39;m thinking some form of <br/>\nhomeschooling or unschooling might be the answer, but I don&#39;t want her <br/>\nto feel isolated from the world and from friends. How do I find other <br/>\nfamilies in my area who are doing this, too?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any advice.<br/>\nCheryl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   Date: Wed, 30 Apr 2003 12:42:07 -0400<br/>\n&gt;   From: &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Inanna1957@...\">Inanna1957@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: intro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello everyone!
