So, I <br/>\nknow where you&#39;re coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would definitely suggest putting stuff out at the kids&#39; level, letting <br/>\nthem pick and choose in their own way. In my mind, that&#39;s what <br/>\nunschooling&#39;s all about. It doesn&#39;t mean not having any &quot;educational&quot; <br/>\nthings like manipulatives around; it just means that you don&#39;t sit your <br/>\nchild down and tell them that it&#39;s &quot;manipulative time.&quot; I try to make sure <br/>\nthat we have things around the house that will spur logical thinking <br/>\n(Zoombini&#39;s, chess, puzzles, etc), math play (Uno, Yatzee, dice, etc), <br/>\nhistory (American Girls, Liberty&#39;s Kids, lots of books), reading (tons of <br/>\nbooks), you name it, but I don&#39;t divide our life into those categories. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t segment or structure our time--those things are available for anyone <br/>\n(including dh and me) to play around with when we feel like it. We have a <br/>\npond, gardens, bird feeders, etc. that are filled with learning <br/>\nopportunities, but no one HAS to work with them--except me, of course ;). <br/>\nWe have a rich environment where learning can happen, and we go on TONS of <br/>\nfield trips, which spur a tremendous amount of learning for ALL of us!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids love playing with tangrams (those colored wooden pieces), puzzles, <br/>\nlegos, geomags, cuisenaire rods, etc. We have lots of neat wooden toys that <br/>\nwould be considered educational, but I just have them out like any other <br/>\ntoy. Just a for instance: I never bought the workbooks that go with the <br/>\ncuisinaire rods, and we&#39;ve never really used them the way they&#39;re <br/>\n&quot;supposed&quot; to be used. But the kids love building with them and making <br/>\npatterns. When my grandfather and other family members have died, they&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen incredibly useful to demonstrate how old that great-grandparent was <br/>\nversus grandma, mama and Emily, Julia or Sam.  We also used them when we <br/>\nread about the sustainable earth, calculated how much we spent per day, <br/>\nfigured out our budget, etc. They are really great for comparing things and <br/>\nputting them into a concrete perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, though, get those things out and give the control to your kids. Let <br/>\nthem decide how, when, and why they&#39;re going to use stuff. The great thing <br/>\nabout Montessori, for instance, is the idea of putting things where the <br/>\nkids can see them, reach them and be responsible for them. The not so great <br/>\nthing about Montessori (in my opinion) is the rigidity of the <br/>\napproach--there&#39;s only one right way to use their toys/ <br/>\nmanipulatives.  Boy, does that cut out creativity and learning <br/>\nopportunities of all kinds!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck! Just keep living and loving--the learning will follow.

And because it is part of<br/>\nevery day stuff, the kids learn it as they need to.  My Zach, age 10, has<br/>\nNEVER been very interested in reading.  He was limited to sounding out 1<br/>\nsyllable words until about a month ago.  He discovered Yu-Gi-Oh cards and to<br/>\nplay very well, he NEEDED to read for himself.....so he does.  He is now<br/>\nreading complete sentences of multi-syllable words.  He learned it when he<br/>\nneeded it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is everywhere, all the time.  Yesterday, we made cinnamon rolls.  There<br/>\nare 7 in the family so the kids were figuring out how many they could each<br/>\nhave out of the batch and it &quot;be fair&quot;.  Danny, age 5, is thrilled because<br/>\n39 pounds is more than 38 pounds so he thinks he just became &quot;bigger&quot; than<br/>\nhis big sister who is 7.  We triple the pancake recipe for Saturday<br/>\nbreakfast so even the very little guys understand that we need 3 eggs<br/>\ninstead of 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes wish we could do with less science around here.  Marsie always<br/>\nhas some concoction or other going in the freezer.  She calls them her<br/>\n&quot;experiments&quot;.  (I have visions of Dr. Frankenstein &lt;grin&gt;).  We are<br/>\nbreeding all the kids 4-H animals and watching the changes in their bodies<br/>\nas the birthing time draws near.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your idea to set the manipulatives out for the kids to mess with is<br/>\na fantastic idea.  But I probably wouldn&#39;t even say much about them, much<br/>\nless about how they are &quot;supposed&quot; to be played with, unless the kids asked<br/>\nspecifically.  Treat the manipulatives the same way you would any new toy.<br/>\nBy exploring and playing with things in new, unique and even &quot;wrong&quot; ways,<br/>\nkids see connections that the manipulative inventor never imagined.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as books and such, if your son is interested in dinosaurs, you might<br/>\nmention there is a book about them upstairs if he is interested or that you<br/>\nsaw a video that might be about that at the library.  Then follow his lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example was Zach being interested in explosive type stuff.  So here I am<br/>\nlooking up explosives on the internet, getting books on fireworks, helping<br/>\nhim build ballistic equipment.

No &quot;school in a box&quot; items, but a<br/>\n&gt; conglomeration of workbooks, tons of books (fiction and nonfiction),<br/>\nmanipulatives,<br/>\n&gt; etc.  Closest I got to real structure were a Saxon K book and a Learn at<br/>\nHome K<br/>\n&gt; curriculum guide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, we started the Learn at Home K book and did activities and readings<br/>\n&gt; every day for about a month back in August/September.  My 4 year old liked<br/>\nit,<br/>\n&gt; never complained about it, and did very well with it.  But I just stopped<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; about a month, and at the time I didn&#39;t know why.  He didn&#39;t ask to do it<br/>\n&gt; after I&#39;d stopped, so we just went back to &quot;normal life.&quot;  I then got sick<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; have been ill for about 2 months, which has made doing more than reading a<br/>\nfew<br/>\n&gt; books a day pretty much impossible.  During that time, though, I have<br/>\nthought a<br/>\n&gt; lot about that month we did the &quot;curriculum&quot; and about whether I felt that<br/>\ndid<br/>\n&gt; him any &quot;real&quot; good.  I looked over the Saxon K book and nearly threw it<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; the wall in frustration - what a pointless waste of paper!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve been watching my son play on his own and learn SO many<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n&gt; He comes to me with questions, or asks to get books at the library on<br/>\nvarious<br/>\n&gt; topics.  So with that, I&#39;m beginning to see how unschooling CAN work with<br/>\n&gt; younger kids.  I &quot;get&quot; how it could be great for older kids, but I guess I<br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; have misgivings/concerns about unschooling such young kids.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically, I want to know this - how do we guide them towards learning<br/>\nsuch<br/>\n&gt; things as math skills and reading/writing without forcing it on them and<br/>\n&gt; defeating the attempt at unschooling?  I know I&#39;m missing a BIG part of<br/>\nthe puzzle<br/>\n&gt; here, and I would appreciate the insight you all have.  Now that I am<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n&gt; over my illness, I was thinking about taking a moderate amount of<br/>\n&gt; books/manipulatives/workbooks and putting them on a small shelf unit in<br/>\nthe hallway, and<br/>\n&gt; rotating the selection so the kids can have access to different materials<br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; week or so.  My concern is this - since they can&#39;t read, they don&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily<br/>\n&gt; know what each book is, or what they would want to do.  Should I sit down<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; tell them about each item, and just let them know it&#39;s there for us to<br/>\n&gt; explore if they would like to?  My son, for example, LOVES workbooks<br/>\n(sporadically,<br/>\n&gt; at least - he goes in phases) - should I put two or three out, tell him<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re about, and just let him as ME to do them, rather than my sitting<br/>\ndown<br/>\n&gt; with him and asking if he wants to do some workbook pages?  As far as<br/>\nreading<br/>\n&gt; goes, they ask constantly, all day, to read, and I almost always oblige<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As you can tell, my intentions are good, but I&#39;m clueless about the<br/>\npractical<br/>\n&gt; side of this whole endeavor.  ANY advice, suggestions, etc would be much<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
