My son is<br/>\nonly 4 and it is comforting to know there are others out there whose older<br/>\nchildren are still in the family bed. ;) I&#39;ve appreciated the cultural<br/>\nreferences and studies too.<br/>\n <br/>\nOur house has an odd 3-level floor plan (like a condo but it&#39;s not) with<br/>\nonly the master bedroom on the top level (with large closet and bathroom<br/>\nsuite), then on the main level where the front door is we have the living<br/>\nroom on one side, stairs up the middle and kitchen with dining area on the<br/>\nother side (plus small bathroom by the front door), then in the daylight<br/>\nbasement, we have 2 more bedrooms, a full bath, and laundry room. One of the<br/>\nbedrooms is the same size as our living room (big) and has a door to the<br/>\nback yard so that is my office, soon to be also play room. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo with this layout, the 2nd bedroom is in the basement and I&#39;m not<br/>\nconfortable having my son 2 floors down and I doubt he would be either! So<br/>\nour room is his room and he thinks nothing odd of that. Some friends have<br/>\nbeen confused when they ask him to show them his room and he takes them up<br/>\nthere! <br/>\n <br/>\nWe do have a toddler bed in our room (at one point we tried to get him to<br/>\nsleep in his own bed, it was even right next to me, but he didn&#39;t like it).<br/>\nWe only put him there now when he falls asleep in the car and mommy and<br/>\ndaddy need some adult time in bed. He&#39;ll join us during the night. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe has slept with Grandma before, in our house. She used to love it when her<br/>\ngranddaughters would sleep with her when she visited their house and has<br/>\nalways pressured Damon to sleep with her. It was uncomfortable the way she&#39;d<br/>\ndo it though, like begging and coersing him and saying we didn&#39;t need him<br/>\nwith us, we needed alone time. I always said to him he can sleep wherever he<br/>\nwants and of course he is welcome with us. He liked to go with Grandma and<br/>\nread stories but when it was time to sleep he&#39;d come back to find us.<br/>\nFinally this spring he did stay the night with her! When we go on vacations<br/>\ntogether, she is always pressuring him too, but he sleeps with us. She is<br/>\nsingle and I think if she needs a bed buddy that badly, she should go find<br/>\nher own!<br/>\n <br/>\nKim Zerbe<br/>\nin Oregon<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]<br/>\nOn Behalf Of Angela Shaw<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, December 09, 2008 8:51 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Need &#39;supporting&#39; links, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Frankly, some of our best discussions and communication is done in the bed<br/>\nlate at night--all of us in the dark (somewhat) and the kids really connect<br/>\nwith us and with eachother in ways that maybe the light of day inhibits.<br/>\nThese memories, this comfort, I am sure, will be the things we all hold on<br/>\ntight to throughout our lives. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the same for us.

I think people forget that as humans, we haven&#39;t always lived<br/>\nin big multi-roomed houses.  Kids often slept together in one bed, or<br/>\nslept in the same sleeping area as the parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my dad was born,  he had 3 older sisters, and his dad worked in a<br/>\nlogging camp.

A<br/>\nhundred years ago, it was more typical to have more children and live in<br/>\nsmaller spaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther cultures are different too.  My kids have been fascinated with the<br/>\nmovie, My Neighbor Totoro.  The girls who are about 6 and 11 both bathe<br/>\nwith their dad, in one big tub and they sleep on their mats together in<br/>\none room.  As I was trying to find information on co-sleeping with older<br/>\nchildren, I ran across several references to Japanese culture that,<br/>\nencourages extended co-sleeping up until 15 yrs of age, and also<br/>\necourages multi-generational co-sleeping.  To sleep alone is not<br/>\nconsidered a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as money and allowance goes, if you&#39;d spend the money on her<br/>\nanyway, why can&#39;t she have it herself?  That is what has given my kids<br/>\nmore freedom of choices, and at the same time allowed us to be able to<br/>\nget out of a store without &quot;having&quot; to buy something.  Both my girls<br/>\nhave bank accounts.  We started off with giving cash, when they are/were<br/>\nlittle, then, as they got older we started doing an automatic debit into<br/>\ntheir account, so that saving could happen.  Our younger daughter still<br/>\ngets cash, but she has an account for when that time comes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want my kids to feel as if they need to earn the things they<br/>\nwant and need.  They will have the entire rest of their life to do that,<br/>\nright now, they are kids and don&#39;t have to.

She had problems in the  <br/>\nmiddle of the night a few times on sleep overs (though always went  <br/>\neagerly.) I&#39;m not sure how much longer sleeping with us would have  <br/>\ngone on but we got ferrets and she decided to move into her bedroom  <br/>\nwith them when she was 14. The next summer, before she turned 15, she  <br/>\nfound a 2 week summer car design camp in Detroit she wanted to go to.  <br/>\nCarl drove her out and dropped her off. (Not with out various qualms  <br/>\non our part, of course! That wasn&#39;t the least bit easy!) She had zero  <br/>\nproblems. She called us every night for the first few nights but then  <br/>\nthat dropped off. (It was a very intensive camp so she was very busy  <br/>\nlate at night.) She didn&#39;t even suffer homesickness. She flew back  <br/>\nall on her own with a layover. She did another camp at 16 in  <br/>\nMinneapolis with a week before stay with a friend in Chicago, flying  <br/>\nby herself. Even so, no one would have claimed she showed any other  <br/>\nsigns of independence, eg, wanting to be out living on her own. It  <br/>\nreally wasn&#39;t until this year at 17 that she&#39;s talked in more  <br/>\nindependent terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis outcome flies in the face of conventional so-called &quot;wisdom&quot; but  <br/>\nit matches human nature better. Conventional wisdom says we need to  <br/>\nmake kids be independent. But that doesn&#39;t make sense. Children -- as  <br/>\nwith all animals -- are naturally dependent.  If kids feel to the  <br/>\ncore of their being that they have a solid foundation of  <br/>\nunconditional support that will last as long as they need it, they  <br/>\ncan spend their time and energy exploring their world pushing their  <br/>\ncomfort level to their own personal edge. It&#39;s hard to explore when  <br/>\nyou&#39;re spending your time and energy worrying about the stability of  <br/>\nyour foundation and your personal safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs fits with that explanation:<br/>\nhttp://tinyurl.com/6ujce)<br/>\n<br/>\n(Would *anyone* think it&#39;s a great idea for western scientists to  <br/>\nswoop into a natural tribe and tell them they need to let go of their  <br/>\ninfants and toddlers and make them live their days with other kids  <br/>\nand adult strangers? Would it even make sense to fear that because  <br/>\nnatural tribe families spend their days and nights together that  <br/>\ngenerations of adults are still living with their parents, unable to  <br/>\nlet go? The tribes would have died out long ago if it weren&#39;t  <br/>\nbiologically natural to seek independence when it was biologically  <br/>\ntime to.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen humans and animals reach the equivalent of teen years, that need  <br/>\nto be independent and do things on their own kicks in. They&#39;re hard  <br/>\nwired that way: hormones or whatever start being produced and make  <br/>\nthem want to do things for themselves and on their own. Independence  <br/>\nis perfectly natural when humans are late teens to early 20&#39;s. (It  <br/>\ncomes later and earlier to some, of course, just like walking and  <br/>\ntalking and reading.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people are filled to the brim with what they need, they can let  <br/>\ngo when other needs come along. It&#39;s the kids who need to hold on but  <br/>\nwho feel pushed away with the overt or silent message of &quot;You need to  <br/>\nbe independent&quot; who hold on as long as they&#39;re allowed, trying to get  <br/>\ntheir fill. That feeling of insecurity will interfere when the drive  <br/>\nto be independent arrives. (Another way parents can interfere with  <br/>\nindependence besides pushing is filling kids with fear when the kids  <br/>\nstart making forays into independence)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She is concerned that Tails receives what we call `monthly money&#39;<br/>\n&gt; (some would call it an allowance) and that we do not have required<br/>\n&gt; chores in order for her to receive it. Sandra&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; (http://sandradodd.com/chores) is good but it doesn&#39;t really address<br/>\n&gt; what Mil considers the receipt of `free money&#39;. I also found<br/>\n&gt; (http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%<br/>\n&gt; 20behavior/chores/tyingallowancetochores.html).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The concept of needing to work for money is not brain surgery ;-)  <br/>\nUnless parents never mention finances and lie about where the  <br/>\nbreadwinner goes each day, kids can&#39;t grow to adulthood without  <br/>\nrealizing that money doesn&#39;t come for free from an ATM ;-) They *are*  <br/>\ngoing to grasp that they&#39;ll need a job for their own money. That need  <br/>\nto have control over their lives, as well as what money comes in and  <br/>\nhow much goes out and where, is a part of natural independence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the unnecessary process of teaching kids that they need to earn  <br/>\ntheir money we can end up teaching them lessons we don&#39;t intend.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ll see that mom and dad share the money freely but are stingy  <br/>\nwhen it comes to the kids. Unless there&#39;s barely enough money for  <br/>\nbasic necessities, kids really can&#39;t grasp that a lot of the money is  <br/>\nfor family maintenance and not &quot;free to do as your please money&quot;  <br/>\nbecause all kids really see is parents freely choosing to spend money  <br/>\n(and parents often do mix in &quot;free choice&quot; purchases too so shopping  <br/>\nis rarely clear cut). It&#39;s not until they&#39;re adults with their own  <br/>\nobligations that they can grasp that concept in an adult way. Until  <br/>\nthen they get a very different message than we intend.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we tie their money to chores ... well, there are a huge number of  <br/>\nunintended lessons they learn that I&#39;ve talked about over the years.  <br/>\nThere are 15 pages (!) of the common concerns about chores at:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://joyfullyrejoycing.com/<br/>\n<br/>\ndown the right hand side.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we&#39;ve always helped her get what she needed, Kat doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>\nneedy for money. And, as a teen she&#39;s very conscious of spending  <br/>\nmoney that she didn&#39;t contribute to earning. Not because we&#39;ve taught  <br/>\nher that, but because it&#39;s time for her to see the world that way as  <br/>\nshe grows toward independence. How many conventionally parented teens  <br/>\ncan you hand $20 to who won&#39;t hope that mom and dad forget to ask for  <br/>\nthe change, or who might lie about how much something was so they can  <br/>\nkeep the change? Not because they&#39;re dishonest, but because they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel supported in their needs and the only way to get some  <br/>\nindependent money is covertly (or getting a job under pressure).<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need &#39;supporting&#39; links, etc.","postDate":"1228710463","msgId":40839,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMjA3MjAyN3UxYzU3MjI4Zm82NWY4OTllZDYxZjAzZmU4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEEwODU4NEI5LTFDNTktNEY3Ny04RUNGLUQ3MkEyRUM3OTYzM0BtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdoaTQybCtkZDdsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPEEwODU4NEI5LTFDNTktNEY3Ny04RUNGLUQ3MkEyRUM3OTYzM0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40838,"nextInTopic":40842,"prevInTime":40838,"nextInTime":40840,"topicId":40837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have some friends in Pittsburgh who weren t unschoolers whose only child co-slept until age 11.
