We had plenty of room. I thought it was terrible that in &quot;the city&quot;<br/>\nyou could actually see your neighbor&#39;s house from your own. But now I&#39;ve<br/>\nlived in town for over 10 years and I&#39;d never want to go back to gravel<br/>\nroads and cow manure. I like things like sidewalks. It&#39;s all just personal<br/>\npreferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like how (in my experience) kids are _more_ supervised here in town.<br/>\nThere&#39;s less room to hide. I can hear or see my children nearly all the way<br/>\naround the block. Back in &quot;the country&quot;, kids would go into the woods to do<br/>\ndrugs or have sex. (or set fires or torture animals, etc, etc)  My old<br/>\nclassmates weren&#39;t the best sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had ups and downs with the neighbor kids. Some are allowed to run<br/>\naround the neighborhood at the age of 4. If they seemed to have any<br/>\nredeeming qualities I&#39;d let them play with my kids at my house only and get<br/>\nthem used to our rules. If they did rude or obnoxious things I sent them<br/>\nhome. There&#39;s only one kid who was permanently banned. The others have<br/>\ndeveloped into reasonable playmates. They are all p/s-ed so we don&#39;t see<br/>\nthem much now. Their best friends are other unschoolers they have common<br/>\ninterests with....theater, ballet, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13091,"nextTopicId":13096}}
