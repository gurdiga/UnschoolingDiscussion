Spirited, some have called him. Hell<br/>\non<br/>\n&gt; wheels, say others. :) He very much lives to his own agenda -- didn&#39;t say<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt; single word in English until 18 months -- won&#39;t respond to anything if<br/>\nhe&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; engrossed in something -- refuses to communicate unless it&#39;s his idea --<br/>\n&gt; etc. He&#39;s loving and responsive with me and with my husband, but with<br/>\nother<br/>\n&gt; people he sometimes is charming and engaging, but mostly is aloof and<br/>\nlooks<br/>\n&gt; right through them. This includes grandparents, to their chagrin. I think<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; has a delightful personality and I love just watching him when he&#39;s all<br/>\n&gt; closed off from the world, doing his little thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, the problem is that Benny has opposite reactions to things -- caffeine<br/>\n&gt; makes him focus or go to sleep. Cough medicine makes him insanely hyper.<br/>\n&gt; Uppers take him down, downers take him up. I don&#39;t know MUCH about this<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; people are telling me I need to take him to a pediatrician and get him<br/>\n&gt; &quot;diagnosed&quot; because he may have some sort of problem. I just don&#39;t feel<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; he could possibly be any of these things (hyperactive, add, whatever)<br/>\n&gt; because he has a very long attention span for something he is interested<br/>\nin,<br/>\n&gt; very very long.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s recently had some sleep pattern changes -- waking up at one am and<br/>\n&gt; peacefully sitting in his bed reading to himself, or playing with<br/>\nwhatever&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; in his room. Going back to sleep at five or so. He&#39;s also gotten extremely<br/>\n&gt; extremely obsessive about alphabet-related things. Like the Dr. Seuss ABC<br/>\n&gt; book/video, which he must have many many times all the time (and it has to<br/>\n&gt; be read exactly the same way every time). Like his sponge letters/magnet<br/>\n&gt; letters, which he must put in order in ways that involve little rituals<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; going from room to room, when he can&#39;t find one he goes crazy. He will<br/>\ntype<br/>\n&gt; the alphabet into the computer and then delete it up to 10 times in a row.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s kind of TOO intense and weird. The only books he wants to look at are<br/>\n&gt; alphabet/number books, the only videos are alphabet/number videos, etc.<br/>\nIt&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; all he thinks or talks about -- last night in the middle of the night the<br/>\n&gt; first sound I heard out of the monitor when he woke up was &quot;THE NUMBER<br/>\n&gt; FOUR!&quot; in a sonorous tone. ?????<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What is going on with him? I *will not* allow some assembly line<br/>\n&gt; pediatrician to stamp some label on him and hand me a prescription to fix<br/>\n&gt; him -- I think he is just perfect. However, I worry that he&#39;s getting<br/>\n&gt; stressed out with all these rituals he forces himself through and all this<br/>\n&gt; repetition and &quot;studying&quot; -- he&#39;s only two ferchrissakes. And the thing<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; the caffeine is worrying to my parents -- they are convinced there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; something wrong with him and that he needs ritalin. ??? Am I being stupid<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; ignore this and just say HE IS FINE and press on? I mean, SHOULD I get him<br/>\n&gt; looked at?

Am I being stupid<br/>\nto <br/>\nignore this and just say HE IS FINE and press on?<br/>\n<br/>\nLily, I remember being two and being just as fascinated with things like<br/>\nyour son.  People used to say I was &quot;retarded&quot; because I didn&#39;t talk<br/>\nuntil I was three.  But when I talked, I talked like an adult.  I can<br/>\nremember listening to adult conversation and understanding every bit of<br/>\nit when I was one and a half .  I tuned people out to explore my<br/>\nimagination.  I was also fascinated with letters and words.  When I<br/>\nlearned to read, I would read a book forwards and literally backwards<br/>\nseveral times.  It was fun for me.  I also used to &quot;obsess&quot; over noises I<br/>\ncould make with my nose and mouth and throat.  I would go for long<br/>\nperiods of time gazing at the patterns on linoleum and wallpaper and<br/>\nceilings with symmetrical patterns.  I would make up songs and sing them<br/>\nover and over again.  My brother used to spend long periods of time<br/>\nlooking at himself in the mirror and making weird faces at himself.  He<br/>\nhas a very good sense of humor.  My brother is a genius.  He used to be<br/>\nobsessed with electrical parts.  He knew how the truck motor worked when<br/>\nhe was four.  When he was two, he would have a daily ritual of<br/>\ndisassembling our phonograph and tape recorder.  We would scold him, so<br/>\nhe would reassemble them and they worked fine.  I used to think, what a<br/>\nstrange kid, but now I know my step mom just unschooled him, letting him<br/>\nexplore his interests.  As an older child, his bedroom floor was<br/>\nliterally covered with circuits and parts for circuits.  He works for<br/>\nMicrosoft and is doing just fine.  Maybe some would say I had ADD as a<br/>\nchild and others would say my brother was hyperactive.  <br/>\nYou say he forces himself to do this.  My son Rex was sort of like that<br/>\nonly in different things when he was young.  For example, his shoelaces<br/>\nhad to be tied perfectly symmetrically.  He would do them over and over<br/>\nagain, and squeal in frustration every time it wasn&#39;t.  His toys had to<br/>\nbe in a certain order.  He seemed like maybe he was hyperactive or<br/>\nsomething, but the teachers always said they didn&#39;t think so because he<br/>\ndid have such a long attention span when it was something he liked.  My<br/>\ncousin was on ritalin as a child.  When I mentioned it to her talking<br/>\nabout my son&#39;s behavior, she was very much passionately against it.  She<br/>\nsaid it ruined her childhood.  She said we should just let children be<br/>\nand they will turn out okay.  I think you should keep giving him what he<br/>\nwants-the opportunity to &quot;repeat and study&quot; and new things to explore. <br/>\nHey, that is how the brain learns things.  At any rate, how does your<br/>\nson&#39;s behavior hurt him.  Since he is only two, I wouldn&#39;t worry about<br/>\nit.  There is no hurry.  But then, I am not a doctor and am not qualified<br/>\nto give medical advice.  He sounds like he wants to read.  Can he read? <br/>\nI have a friend whose son taught himself to read at two asking her what<br/>\nthe words said in books as she was reading to him.  Your son sounds like<br/>\nhe knows what he wants.  Let him lead, I say.<br/>\nBonni     <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1572768,"authorName":"Stephanie Elms","from":"&quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; &lt;stephanie.elms@...&gt;","profile":"elmsfam","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] I need help","postDate":"1019156453","msgId":35248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDEyOTU5Q0RAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35226,"nextInTopic":35259,"prevInTime":35247,"nextInTime":35249,"topicId":35221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I was going to keep quiet for a little while (I just joined yesterday) but your son sounds very much like the son of a good friend of mine, especially","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1925920319\">Well, I was going to keep quiet for a little while (I just joined yesterday) but your son sounds very much like the son of a good friend of mine, especially the intense focus (near obsession) when learning something new and the strong reactions to chemicals.

That&#39;s why Ritalin, a stimulant for adults, is<br/>\nused to &quot;slow down&quot; hyperactive kids.  The interpersonal<br/>\nreactions may be driving the concerns being raised by others - as<br/>\nin &quot;Any normal kid would love me to pieces; if he doesn&#39;t there<br/>\nmust be something wrong.&quot;  Taint necessarily so.  Some kids are<br/>\nmore attached than others, or may have periods of being more self<br/>\nconscious/detached from strangers.  The ritualized behavior you<br/>\ndescribe is harder to get a hold of, because the label itself<br/>\ncarries so much weight.  Can you remember a time when he was<br/>\ntrying to learn something else - like first mastering walking or<br/>\nusing eating utensils?  If he conquers new important tasks with a<br/>\nsingle minded concentration you may be on the cusp of early<br/>\nreading; you certainly have discovered something about his<br/>\nlearning style that will help you in offering new information<br/>\nover the years.  One thing to try, to see if the letters are a<br/>\ncompulsion or a fascination, is to do something different.  Go to<br/>\na woodsy park and walk around looking at wild flowers - or go to<br/>\nthe zoo - or hit a kid&#39;s museum - find a train display -<br/>\nsomething that he is likely to like, but that is not going to<br/>\ntrigger alphabet thoughts.  See if he engages in a different<br/>\nsituation or if he dreadfully misses the letters.  If he does,<br/>\nwait a couple of weeks and try again with a different activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile early identification of some disabilities may make a world<br/>\nof difference for some kids, misdiagnosis and early mislabeling<br/>\nalways makes a difference, typically a bad one.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lily James&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:glamatron@...\">glamatron@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 17, 2002 2:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] I need help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| I&#39;m asking you because you&#39;re used to thinking outside the box,<br/>\nand I want<br/>\n| some different opinions from the ones I&#39;ve been getting.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| My son, age 27 months, is energetic.

This includes grandparents, to their<br/>\nchagrin.

Like the Dr.<br/>\nSeuss ABC<br/>\n| book/video, which he must have many many times all the time<br/>\n(and it has to<br/>\n| be read exactly the same way every time). Like his sponge<br/>\nletters/magnet<br/>\n| letters, which he must put in order in ways that involve little<br/>\nrituals like<br/>\n| going from room to room, when he can&#39;t find one he goes crazy.<br/>\nHe will type<br/>\n| the alphabet into the computer and then delete it up to 10<br/>\ntimes in a row.<br/>\n| It&#39;s kind of TOO intense and weird. The only books he wants to<br/>\nlook at are<br/>\n| alphabet/number books, the only videos are alphabet/number<br/>\nvideos, etc. It&#39;s<br/>\n| all he thinks or talks about -- last night in the middle of the<br/>\nnight the<br/>\n| first sound I heard out of the monitor when he woke up was &quot;THE<br/>\nNUMBER<br/>\n| FOUR!&quot; in a sonorous tone. ?????<br/>\n|<br/>\n| What is going on with him?

However, I worry that he&#39;s<br/>\ngetting<br/>\n| stressed out with all these rituals he forces himself through<br/>\nand all this<br/>\n| repetition and &quot;studying&quot; -- he&#39;s only two ferchrissakes.

Whatever happens <br/>\nhappens and we deal with it and get through it and move on.  Worrying <br/>\njust makes it less fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second advice is to go to the website that Kate sent the other day <br/>\nfor NIMH and read up on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and other <br/>\ndisorders.  The better educated you are yourself, the more likely you <br/>\nwill obtain proper treatment if it is needed and avoid unnecessary <br/>\ntreatment by doctors who think drugs are always the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy third advice is to tell the grandparents that LOTS of kids react <br/>\nthat way to caffeine.  It is not an idication that they must be put on <br/>\nritalin (which is also a stimulant).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that concerns me about your son as you describe him is <br/>\nthis:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I worry that he&#39;s getting stressed out with all these rituals he <br/>\n&gt; forces himself through and all this repetition and &quot;studying&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he is unhappy and frustrated with himeself, I would do something, <br/>\nI&#39;d be cautious and learn all I could first, but I would take him for <br/>\nan evaluation.  If he is not unhappy and you are not overly concerned <br/>\nabout his health, I would leave it be for a while and just keep <br/>\nlearning all I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you in some way, even if it is just helpful knowing <br/>\nthat others are going through similar things and you are not alone.  <br/>\nWyndham is going in for an evaluation next week because his repetitive <br/>\nbehaviours are starting to bother him.
