It is about her experiences raising her son as a single mom.   It is so funny and heart breaking and I have given it to many new moms.  But I love when she says, early in the book, that she can&#39;t believe she brought a child into the world who will someday have to endure seventh grade!  I don&#39;t have the book right now so can&#39;t quote it.    Our kids never have to go through seventh grade.  At least they are spared that!<br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.

It&#39;s being confused and unsure <br/>\nand not knowing every day when you wake up who you&#39;re going to see in the <br/>\nmirror, and then spending most of the day every day surrounded by others just as <br/>\nconfused and unsure as yourself, with a few overwhelmed adults trying to <br/>\nmaintain order and perhaps one or two adults around as actual models for what a good <br/>\nadult life might look like. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not natural or normal for people to have to grow up this way. Age <br/>\nsegregated schools are a very recent phenomenon even in historical times, let alone <br/>\nevolutionarily. And the jr high idea, segregating the pubescence off into <br/>\ntheir own building, away from the moderating influences of children younger than <br/>\nthem, teens older than them, and much of any real interaction with adults, is <br/>\nvery very new. I think it&#39;s proven to be a spectacularly bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our society would be infinitely better off if we shut down the jr <br/>\nhighs and found a way to give every pubescent kid a real job with real <br/>\nresponsibilities (not necessarily a paid job) where he can be really needed, a job where <br/>\nhe interacts with older and younger people much more than with other <br/>\npubescent people. And then a few years later, all those who need to be in high school <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s what our society does will be able to handle it better because <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be walking in much less scarred. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot that I&#39;m opinionated or anything. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76718,"nextTopicId":76711}}
