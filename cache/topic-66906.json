The <br/>\ncurrent phone message says it&#39;s full for May, and the line will re-open up <br/>\nwhen June shows are scheduled. I need to plan this trip waaaay in advance, <br/>\nmostly because my girlfriend who will be going with me (hubby and kids <br/>\nstaying here), needs to tell her work in January her vacation days for the <br/>\nwhole year. Also advance planing because of airline tix (I live in <br/>\nCalifornia) and hotel reservations. So my Q to you (or anyone else who knows) <br/>\nis, once I finally get ahold of the show, do you happen to know if they make <br/>\nany kind of reservations way in advance (as in mid-next year) now, or is it <br/>\neach month for the following month? (It doesn&#39;t specify on the website or <br/>\nphone recording.) It&#39;s my understanding that it&#39;s hard to get thru, and that <br/>\nwhen you do, tix are mostly already gone. So, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to <br/>\nplan a trip in advance if that&#39;s the case, and I can&#39;t get advance <br/>\nreservations. TIA to any who has info!!
