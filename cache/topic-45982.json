Because of his Cystic Fibrosis (he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fully digest fat), he can clear a room with his farts. As with many <br/>\nin his age range, he is quite proud of this ability. Thus the name Stinky. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the recent posts I asked if the name bothered him at all. His response, <br/>\n&quot;I do stink; I have great farts.&quot; He just asks that I not scream it to him in <br/>\na public place (I don&#39;t).
