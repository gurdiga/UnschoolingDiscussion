He was taking a series of classes on ceramics (he takes shop <br/>\nand home economics classes at the local junior high school - they <br/>\nhave been really flexible about letting him do this without him <br/>\ntaking any other classes there) and he decided to make &quot;Gary&quot; the <br/>\nsnail from Spongebob.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe was really enthusiastic about the project and we proudly display <br/>\nhis object d&#39;art on the entertainment stand. Though, at first, I must <br/>\nadmit that I didn&#39;t understand why my son kept saying &quot;mew&quot; every <br/>\ntime he showed Gary to someone. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn answer to my question, he reenacted an episode where Spongebob <br/>\nthrows a stick and Gary has to go and &quot;fetch.&quot; It takes most of the <br/>\nepisode for Gary to bring the stick back to Spongebob and then he <br/>\ndrops it at his feet and says &quot;Mew!&quot; A mixed up snail/dog/cat <br/>\ncreature. Like Brynn, I laughed myself silly as my son told me about <br/>\nthe show.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis subject reminds me about a TV inspired game that we play after <br/>\ndinner some nights. It&#39;s called &quot;Name that Pokemon!&quot; It is a charades <br/>\ngame where each person has to get up and do the motions of a pokemon <br/>\ncharacter and the others have to guess which one it is.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe game has gotten to be a little tough for me in the last year, as <br/>\nI haven&#39;t kept up with all the new critters, but I know enough from <br/>\nwhen the show first came out (and the subsequent movies) to <br/>\nparticipate. My best charade is Diglet, but I do a pretty mean <br/>\nPsyduck as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for a fun thread.<br/>\n <br/>\nDona Baker</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3880872,"authorName":"Karen Matlock","from":"&quot;Karen Matlock&quot; &lt;kbmatlock@...&gt;","profile":"kbmatlock","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE:Spongebob Squarepants","postDate":"1010616771","msgId":30892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJORUFJS0ZJTUlMREZIQ0JQUE1NQUVLRUNNQUEua2JtYXRsb2NrQHlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTA2MDEyNjIuMTY2OC4yNDAwMS5tNEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30901,"prevInTime":30891,"nextInTime":30893,"topicId":30892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ll admit, I m a (formerly) reluctant Spongebob convert.

I was against it<br/>\non principle, then realized I didn&#39;t know anything about it and decided to<br/>\nwatch. My sides hurt. The swearing episode is really funny. I like the<br/>\nwriting; it&#39;s clever and makes use of double meanings, etc. Then again, ds<br/>\nwatches Dragonball Z religiously, so we&#39;re not exactly the limiting types<br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a problem with Boy Meets World. Even though the actors are good<br/>\nand the writing is funny, it bugs me that these two kids get married right<br/>\nout of high school. Bad sitcoms aren&#39;t limited to grownups, unfortunately.<br/>\nIf anyone knows anything redeeming about that show, let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMattie<br/>\nE.R., Friends, The Practice addict<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n_________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?\r<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30898,"nextTopicId":30909}}
