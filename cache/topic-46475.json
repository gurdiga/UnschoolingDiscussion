I have been trying to look at my unschooling one day at a time,<br/>\nas far as the choices, and one month at a time, as far as how it&#39;s going.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me restate that.  When my son asks, &quot;Is it okay if I....&quot;, I might<br/>\nfigure, well, sure, why not.  I mean, is it going to ruin him to have<br/>\nanother whavever?  But I wait until the end of the month or more to<br/>\nevaluate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you tried withdrawing all tv limits, then you might have days where your<br/>\nchildren watched a whole lot of tv, but looking back over a month, would you<br/>\nfeel like all they did was watch tv?  Probably not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, consider your own habits.  You&#39;ve said nothing about your own tv<br/>\nviewing, so I have no idea what you do.  My husband and I don&#39;t watch much<br/>\ntv and don&#39;t pay for cable.  TV isn&#39;t part of our son&#39;s habits, either, at<br/>\nleast now (he&#39;s 6).  If the adults watch a lot of tv, or have the tv on for<br/>\nbackground, then maybe your concerns about what your young children see or<br/>\nhow much they watch are different than ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do suspect that some of the studies that have been done about TV viewing<br/>\nhabits do not take into account that in many, many homes the TV runs<br/>\nconstantly.  Whether or not the children actually watch it may be debatable.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46468,"nextTopicId":46492}}
