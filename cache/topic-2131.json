I highly recommend <br/>\nthem!  They helped us a lot to understand our children&#39;s frustrations with <br/>\neach other better and help them to deal with each other.  How To Talk is very <br/>\ninformative also.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease run out and get these books from your library or local book store... <br/>\nyou won&#39;t be sorry and you might even be quite relieved!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think public school has too much to do with sibling rivalry and <br/>\nquarreling.  it is more the fact the two or more very different personalities <br/>\nare in close quarters together for an extended period of time ( mainly a <br/>\nlifetime for them) and it can cause friction and problems mor often than not. <br/>\n We get into disagreements with our spouses and we don&#39;t always get along.  I <br/>\ndo feel this is simply because you are together for an extended period of <br/>\ntime... and you get on each others nerves!<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents to do opt out of trying to help the children become better at <br/>\ncommunicating their feelings in a more appropriate, less damaging way.  Some <br/>\nparents chalk it up as normal.  We have never allowed our children to resort <br/>\nto physical violence and their father and I have learned how to communicate <br/>\nwithout demeaning and degrading each other.  So I believe it is possible for <br/>\nour children to learn to communicate more effectively.  Harming another <br/>\nperson has always been where the line is drawn, verbally or physically.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet the books though!  I have to go back to them time and again to &quot;get a <br/>\ngrip&quot; and get myself into a state of mind where &quot;I&quot; can deal with them and <br/>\ntheir bickering.  I had to buy them because they get used time and again!<br/>\n<br/>\nKim in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2128,"nextTopicId":2135}}
