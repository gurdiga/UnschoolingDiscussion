My name is <br/>\nTara, and I have been lurking for a while. I have made some small <br/>\nposts here and there, but have not formally introduced myself. I <br/>\nhave a three and a half yo boy named Jacob. I am staying at home <br/>\nwith him, and unschooling. This thread has really taken me back. <br/>\nJacob is also very spirited. I also didn&#39;t realize when he was <br/>\nyounger that other children were not like this. When he was that age <br/>\nhe was constantly into anything that he was around. He would pick <br/>\nstuff up, look at them, see how they works, manipulate everyting and <br/>\nclimb everything. He was just constantly experimenting with anything <br/>\nhe could find. He would run down the isles at the grocery store, the <br/>\nlibrary, and anywhere else.  I find that because he threw himself <br/>\ninto so much, so fast, he learned quite a lot about safety on his <br/>\nown, through experience, very quickly. He has gotten to the point <br/>\nnow where he understands safety issues quite well, and that it is a <br/>\ngood idea to stay close to me out in public. With him, once he was <br/>\nable to verbally ask about things, it moved from getting into to <br/>\neverything, to CONSTANTLY asking about EVERYTHING.  So although I <br/>\nknow it takes a lot of energy on your part, just relax and enjoy <br/>\nthis extremely curious being, knowing that you are doing what is <br/>\nbest for them just by allowing them to explore and to learn from the <br/>\nworld around them. It was definately a challenge then (and now) but <br/>\nhe has really brought out my curiousity about life again. It is <br/>\ngreat, and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. - Tara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mark and Rheta <br/>\nWallingford&quot; &lt;wallingford@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our 2yo is a whirlwind.
