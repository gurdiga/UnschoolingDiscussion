They are both very bright girls, my 8 year old has a vocabulary at her command that even surprises us sometimes.

It was pretty similiar in my house, there was no interest in continuing something, reading, writing, math, etc if you were &quot;good&quot; at it.  If I brought home straight A&#39;s- no attention was paid to me, but rather my struggling sibling with C&#39;s.  We are a big family that reads today.  I told my husband when I first got pregnant that I needed his help, because I wanted our children to always enjoy reading but in my family it was punishment- if you were in trouble it was common to hear &quot;NO! go read in your room&quot; and all other privelidges were taken- so it was very negative to me, reading was something I HAD to do when I was in trouble.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting read to aloud is still great, my girls are still young beginner readers, yet I plan to always read daily out loud.  We take turns reading a book- this way we all pick a book we would like to read, and everyone gets to hear it whether they were originally interested in it or not- and usually 1/2 way in everyone is hooked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I have even reconnected this way- we used to (before time got ahold of us) read a book together, taking turns reading outloud.  I think its wonderful- and like you said, something that shouldn&#39;t end just because you know how to do it- otherwise why do you learn in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sanguinegirl83@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 10/26/2009 5:31:07 A.M.

It helped me a lot to think about the differences in reading in Japan and degrees of illiteracy when my children weren&#39;t yet reading. When David was working at the Nichibunken institute in Kyoto another professor gave a lecture on Japanese literacy and how, because it is a written language with 50,000 characters/words, it is unlikely that one person will be able to recognize every piece of the literate puzzle that comes along. Children in school learn some 1000 characters/words to start off. It is very different from a base of 26 characters, and a very different structure. And that&#39;s just kanji. You have hiragana and katakana to add to that mix. <br/>\n<br/>\n I was totally illiterate when we lived in Japan. I could recognise the kanji on the bus to get home. The one to get to central Kyoto was easy, it was the only one that came to the bus stop. I found places to go by asking people I knew. I talked to people. I carried around a translator. I&#39;d point to the plastic food in the window at a restaurant to order if the menu didn&#39;t have pictures.  I negotiated with the world in a very different way to how I negotiate in an area with English subtitles telling me whats on offer from place to place. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was 8 he wasn&#39;t interested in reading. He wasn&#39;t ready to read, so it was good that disinterest was part of the picture. Maybe that&#39;s the case for most people, interest and ability come together at much the same time. Maybe not. I do know some frustrated not yet readers. Simon didn&#39;t read until 12. And his reading skills are growing quite quickly. I imagine it won&#39;t be long that you won&#39;t be able to tell the difference between his reading skills and his sister&#39;s who started reading at 6. Reading takes more than desire to make it happen. The neural pathways have to be open, there has to be a kind of development in place, otherwise it is all about frustration and a sense of failure. Once all those pieces are in place, it&#39;s like riding a bike, it just goes, it just all comes together. <br/>\n<br/>\nBreathe, relax, and enjoy. Oh, and get books on tape or cd or mp3. Simon came to prefer Stephen Fry&#39;s readings of Harry Potter to mine. And it certainly gave him access to books that he wanted. Still does. He wanders around with the ipod in his pocket and listens to Terry Pratchett or J.K. Rowlings or Eoin Colfer a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: unschoolers4 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolers4@...\">unschoolers4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 25 October, 2009 23:46:28<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] New Member-Hello!<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nHello, my name is Jeska.  My husband and I have been unschooling our two daughters, ages 6 and 8 since they were born, I guess you could say.  :)  We live in Japan, and I am president of our homeschooling group on the military base where my husband is stationed.  I wanted to join this group because I am the only unschooler in our group here, so things can get lonely.  Especially when all my daughter&#39;s friends start &quot;school at home&quot; in September, and I&#39;m finding myself having those thoughts of &quot;well, maybe we could just do a little of this or that&quot;.  It&#39;s hard to stay strong when you are the only one.  :)  I am firm in my resolve however, constantly working at unschooling myself. <br/>\nMy biggest obstacle right now is being okay with my daughters showing absolutely no interest in learning how to read.  They are both very bright girls, my 8 year old has a vocabulary at her command that even surprises us sometimes.  But just to give an example, I asked her one day if she wanted to learn how to read, she said &quot;no, I want to be one of those adults that can&#39;t read, what are they called again?&quot;, I said &quot;illiterate? &quot;, she said &quot;yes, that&#39;s it, I want to be illiterate&quot;!  I mean, what are you supposed to do with that?  :^)  Of course I don&#39;t want to push,  and it&#39;s not like they don&#39;t love books and reading, because they do.  If my throat could handle it, they would ask me to read to them from sunup to sundown!<br/>\nSo, just hoping to get some encouragement and support from a community of like-minded people, can&#39;t wait to read some of the other posts.
