Once I began researching it (before the internet for me), it became <br/>\nclear that I would not only homeschool her, but unschooling was the way for <br/>\nus. However, it has taken me a long time to get to a comfortable spot in <br/>\nunschooling and letting go. After her experiences with school, my daughter <br/>\nhas decided to not ever return. It wasn&#39;t that it was so bad for her, but she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like having her freedom taken away. And now she has found that <br/>\nunschooling is the way for her as she sees where it can take her. She had <br/>\ntrouble understanding before,  probably due to my inadequacies about it. My <br/>\nson who is almost 2 will have a completely different experience as the way <br/>\nwill have been paved by his sister. A good thing too, as his grandparents <br/>\n(which are different from hers) are both long time teachers, now retired, so <br/>\nit will help that I have the resolve and attitude I have now about it. I was <br/>\nunsure before, but now stand full of confidence in what we are doing. I <br/>\nalways knew it felt right but did not have the ability  to deal with <br/>\nmainstream people.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\nIf you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then <br/>\nmake a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21512,"nextTopicId":21417}}
