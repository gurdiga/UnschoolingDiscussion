You know what<br/>\nthey say about assuming?  it can make a ass of me and you.<br/>\nWhen Lewis was 18 months old, we went to a live concert with him.  We<br/>\nassumed, very wrongly, that he may disturbed the audience, or fall asleep,<br/>\nor fuss for a meal.  To make sure I could go out easily,  I sat on the isle<br/>\nwith him. He watched the whole concert with rapture attention and only<br/>\nnapped during the intermission.<br/>\nIt was a learning experience for me. He now has been to more shows,<br/>\nconcerts, plays and sport events, than I had been by my adult age: and he&#39;s<br/>\nonly 9 . Once he fell asleep during a modern ballet show. But we were dozing<br/>\noff too.<br/>\nThe point is, I didn&#39;t make him sit down and shut up. There was plenty of<br/>\nexample about how to behave in theatres and he learned from them.<br/>\nA few years back we went to a play organised by our local home education<br/>\ngroup. Three quarters of the room was filled with public school children.<br/>\nThey were wild, like animals out of their cage. Lewis leaned on me at one<br/>\npoint and said: &quot;They don&#39;t know how to behave in theatre.  I hope they will<br/>\nshut up during the play.&quot;<br/>\nEnough story for today.<br/>\nFriendship<br/>\nLucie<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most tragic things I know about human nature is<br/>\nthat all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming<br/>\nof some magical rose garden over the horizon, instead of<br/>\nenjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows<br/>\ntoday.<br/>\n--Dale Carnegie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Diane &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cen46624@...\">cen46624@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 06, 2002 8:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34101,"nextTopicId":34111}}
