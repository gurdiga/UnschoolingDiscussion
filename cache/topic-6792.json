With a survey, we hope to obtain and<br/>\nincorporate information from families using diverse approaches to home<br/>\neducation and from homeschoolers applying to a wide range of colleges -<br/>\n2-year institutions, 4-year public and private schools, specialized<br/>\ncolleges, and so on. I am especially interested in those who wrote (and<br/>\ncan<br/>\nshare) their own transcripts, course descriptions, resumes, portfolios,<br/>\nstudent essays, and narratives. We also want to hear from families whose<br/>\nhomeschoolers tried college, but chose not to continue as well as from<br/>\nfamilies who adult children chose a route OTHER than college. We are<br/>\nalso<br/>\nhoping for ethnic, religious, and geographic diversity. We want to hear<br/>\nfrom<br/>\nhome educators worldwide.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you took part in the survey I did in the fall of 2000 for a book on<br/>\nhomeschooling teenagers, know that THIS survey is only about one-third<br/>\nas<br/>\nlong. (By the way, in case you are wondering, Prima Publishing plans to<br/>\nrelease my book, Homeschooling: The Teen Years in May, 2001. If that<br/>\ndate<br/>\nholds up, free copies for contributors should arrive shortly<br/>\nthereafter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two email surveys: (1) one for parents whose homeschooled<br/>\nchildren<br/>\nhave applied to college and (2) one for their children -- former<br/>\nhomeschoolers who now attend college or chose an alternative like work,<br/>\napprenticeships, volunteering, military, etc. The parent survey will<br/>\nprobably take 60-90 minutes to complete. The teen survey is much shorter<br/>\n-<br/>\nabout 10 questions, figure 10-25 minutes. Respondents&#39; anonymity will be<br/>\nprotected in the final publication.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy publisher has guaranteed the first 60 survey respondents a FREE COPY<br/>\nOF<br/>\nTHE PUBLISHED BOOK, which will cover all aspects of college admissions<br/>\nfor<br/>\nhomeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: ONLY request a survey if you have gone through the college<br/>\napplication<br/>\nprocess with a homeschooler OR if you have one or more adult<br/>\nhomeschoolers<br/>\nwho opted out of college. Do not request a survey if your teenage<br/>\nhomeschooler is simply taking college courses concurrent with high<br/>\nschool<br/>\nhomeschooling. If you have a question about this, please write and ask!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in receiving the survey - and if you have the time<br/>\nto<br/>\ncomplete the it IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS -- please email me with the word<br/>\n&quot;SURVEY&quot; in the subject line of your email.  If your homeschool graduate<br/>\nwould consider completing the Homeschool Graduate Survey, please have<br/>\nthat<br/>\ngraduate send me a separate e-mail with &quot;GRADUATE SURVEY&quot; in the subject<br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will email you the survey immediately and await your response. Thanks<br/>\nso<br/>\nmuch for considering contributing to this project!  Please feel free to<br/>\nre-post this note to mailing lists, bulletin boards, private email to<br/>\nfriends and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nCafi Cohen<br/>\nSenior High Columnist, Homeschooling Today<br/>\nOlder Kids Columnist, Home Education Magazine<br/>\nCafi&#39;s Commentary in The LINK: A Homeschool Newspaper<br/>\nAuthor of &quot;And What About College?&quot;  How Homeschooling Leads To<br/>\nAdmissions<br/>\nTo The Best Colleges and Universities (Holt Associates, 1997) and<br/>\nHomeschooling The Teen Years (Prima Publishing, 2000)<br/>\nHomeschool-Teens-College<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolteenscollege.net\">http://www.homeschoolteenscollege.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   <br/>\n The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when <br/>\n Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been <br/>\n Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n Samantha                  B.F.
