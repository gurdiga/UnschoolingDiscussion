(I vacationed <br/>\nat home, but was online for under an hour per day!) <br/>\nJust some news of the new millennium:<br/>\n    Boris Yeltsin retired. He was a wonderful contribution to new Russia, and <br/>\nI wonder what will happen to the country now.<br/>\n    The terrorists that took an airplane overseas released all their <br/>\nhostages. 155 of them. I have not read about what is happening, other than <br/>\nthey drove off and that the government okayed the release of the men they <br/>\nwere fighting for. One man (on his honeymoon) died, and I feel for him, as <br/>\nwell as his new bride/widow. That is indeed a tragedy in the folds. <br/>\n    A woman in Allentown, PA. died 33 hours before seeing her THIRD century. <br/>\nShe died peacefully in a nursing home at age 119. WOW<br/>\n    Australia and Hong Kong have both rang in the New Year. Both are reported <br/>\nwell and Y2K free (that is what they are saying)! <br/>\n    AND... We have our FIRST BABY NEW MILLENNIUM! It is reported that a boy <br/>\nis the first to be born in the New Millennium, at 12:01 in Auckland, New <br/>\nZealand! (6:01 EST)<br/>\n    Well, that is what has happened to date. This century has been a very yo <br/>\nyo one. We have seen a wall go up and come down. Miracles in medicine, <br/>\nleaders, and faith. We have also watched peril, disease, war, and death. This <br/>\ncentury will always be remembered, that is with certainty.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It is our prayer that everyone sees in the New Year without any mishaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod Bless everyone- <br/>\nStephanie, Ron, Martin, James, Stacie, and Tiffany</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5437,"nextTopicId":5439}}
