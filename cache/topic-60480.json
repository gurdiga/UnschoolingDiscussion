Like every book,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1092095536\">I am reading the book because I really like the author and she has lots of good ideas on how to monitor your emotions and your kids emotions.  Like every book, I am taking what I like and discarding the rest.  The only time we have power struggles is when we have to go somewhere at a specific time.  Sometimes warning him before and letting him choose something to bring and choose what he wears... works but other times nothing does.<br/>\n<br/>\n--We decided a long long time ago to have discussions instead of power <br/>\nstruggles, and to base what we would &quot;let&quot; our kids do on what was good for <br/>\nthem and what wouldn&#39;t hurt them, rather than on arbitrary made-up (or <br/>\ntraditional) rules and times and such.--<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with that and I do that too.  We have a great relationship and I discuss things with him all the time and at 2 1/2 he understands a lot of things.  Some things are hard to explain though.  Like when we have to go for supper at my parents and he wants to stay home.  I explain to him that grandma prepared a nice supper for us and she will be upset if we don&#39;t go but he is upset if we go so it&#39;s like telling him her feelings are more important than is.  Anyways, I am reading the  book for new ideas on how to make transitions easier for him I guess.  I don&#39;t believe in time-outs either or spanking.  I also never threaten or impose consequences, but I just wanted your take on this because it&#39;s hard not to question myself sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nManon   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, March 09, 2003 12:11 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Consequences<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 3/8/03 6:45:30 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manon_brisson@...\">manon_brisson@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; I know this issue as been discussed many times before but will you please <br/>\n  bear with me.
