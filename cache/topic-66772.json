Do it when they WANT it. Sometimes <br/>\nkids (not just kids---me, too!) are too wrapped up in something to eat. Take <br/>\nit to them if you know they&#39;re hungry. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know the child loves training dogs, get her a good dog and a few <br/>\nbooks. E-mail her websites. Buy her gift certificates to dog e-stores. Take <br/>\nher to an obedience trial. If YOU think she should love to train a dog <br/>\nbecause someday she might own a dog. but she has no interest---then the dog, <br/>\nthe books, the websites, the trial, and the gift certificates are a waste of <br/>\ntime and money. They aren&#39;t feeding her passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nASKING and WANTING are two different things. I *wanted* a horse. I knew how <br/>\nexpensive it was. I never asked. Daddy KNEW I wanted a horse. He bought me <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe *could&#39;ve* bought me a tennis racket because he knew that one day I might <br/>\nwant to play tennis. I hate tennis. He knew that.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child&#39;s learning is like that. In unschooling, we give them things to fire <br/>\nup a present passion. It&#39;s not our goal to *make* a passion, but to fuel one <br/>\nalready there. We *may* present a new one---and that&#39;s cool---when a child <br/>\nfinds a new passion. I did that with my oldest: I showed him a magic trick <br/>\none night and it evolved into a huge passion---and he was GOOD! Really good! <br/>\nMaybe Vegas-good. But he lost the passion. No big deal---it&#39;s a part of him <br/>\nand always will be. And he can maybe use it later on in his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy job is to feed passions and to present new possibilities for passions. NOT <br/>\nto force ones that aren&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66484,"nextTopicId":66780}}
