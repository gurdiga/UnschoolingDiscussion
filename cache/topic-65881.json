I expected<br/>\n&gt; her to read early and to love reading.  As a child,  I was an early<br/>\n&gt; reader.

(His other mom and his dad took <br/>\nlonger to really get it.)  When he left school he was already a passionate <br/>\nreader, and never had any problems.  As a matter of fact, it was instrumental <br/>\nin our decision to pull him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night Beth had been reading to him at bedtime. They finished, then she <br/>\nsaid he could finish the chapter in the book he had been reading on his own <br/>\nbefore turning out the light. Two hours later he came out saying, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nlonely.&quot; He&#39;d been reading the entire time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we tucked him in again and turned out the light he said, &quot;The biggest <br/>\nproblem with school is there&#39;s never enough time to read.&quot;  BINGO!  The <br/>\ndecision was made.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...the confession. Intellectually, I know that he would have been a reader <br/>\nwhether or not he went to school.... But it made buying into Unschooling <br/>\nIMMEASURABLY easier knowing he could.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it all comes down to what we think is important. Julian hated <br/>\ncursive, and gave up on it early. I didn&#39;t care about that at all except.... <br/>\nHis Other parents (who shall remain nameless in this example) have signatures <br/>\nthat lead to banks calling for signature checks, etc. His father, in fact, no <br/>\nlonger bothers to write letters, just a hastily written line. I told Julian I <br/>\nknew it was my stuff, but that I wanted him to have a legible signature. So I <br/>\nmade it worth his while (bribery), and he practiced writing his name in <br/>\ncursive until he had it down. He thought it was funny (and was probably <br/>\nrelieved that that was all I cared about re: cursive), and told me he&#39;d do it <br/>\nwithout the bribery. I figured he deserved it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, he still doesn&#39;t know his times tables, and early on we <br/>\ntold him he didn&#39;t need to unless he wanted to. From D&D, he can do <br/>\npercentages and other bizarre things in his head. I never stressed about <br/>\nthat...but I am not a Math kinda gal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...I really admire the folks who just trust their kids will learn to read <br/>\neven if it takes them a while, and I&#39;ve read enough of your stories to <br/>\nunderstand that you are right... And I&#39;m really glad he already knew. <br/>\nProbably saved him from lots of those &quot;My GOD WHAT AM I DOING TO MY KID&#39;S <br/>\nLIFE??!!! moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65850,"nextTopicId":3405}}
