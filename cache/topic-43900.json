My daughter is 8. I&#39;m <br/>\ncurious how your daughter went from no math (Other than &quot;life&quot; math) <br/>\nto senior level statistics courses? I&#39;m led to believe that she <br/>\nwould first need algebra, trig, calc, etc. before that. Also, (I know <br/>\nthis is premature) did your daughter get a &quot;diploma&quot; or complete her <br/>\nGED before going onto college? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is asking to do math out of books, she wants to keep up <br/>\nwith her school-age friends.  (We previously were doing &quot;school at <br/>\nhome&quot; homeschooling, and battling every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it will be a few years before I have to worry about &quot;high <br/>\nschool&quot; unschooling, but how do you handle the record keeping, or <br/>\ntranscript?  I like to look ahead, and not be too surprised.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\nChristine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43728,"nextTopicId":43891}}
