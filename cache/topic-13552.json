He was sooo <br/>\ndisappointed when Cody didn&#39;t show up at Scout Night. However, Cody has two <br/>\nmoms. They don&#39;t flaunt, but they don&#39;t make their arrangement a secret, <br/>\neither. They are very involved in their kids&#39; lives ... coaching soccer, <br/>\netc. I&#39;m sure they simply don&#39;t want their son to be part of a group that <br/>\nofficially denounces his parents. I think that&#39;s understandable. The group <br/>\nis missing out on a great family, though, and Cody is missing out on a great <br/>\nexperience that could really benefit him. For now I guess we&#39;ll just go <br/>\ncamping as two families, and try to figure out what to do morally in the <br/>\nfuture, when Tony figures out why his friend feels excluded from this group <br/>\nthat is supposedly for &quot;all boys.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13548,"nextTopicId":13531}}
