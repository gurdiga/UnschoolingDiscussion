My son is 3.  We have<br/>\n&gt; been trying to conceive and are thankfully nearing the end of our<br/>\n&gt; first trimester with fraternal twins, due in august.  My son will be a<br/>\n&gt; few weeks away from his 4th birthday when the babies arrive.  Due to<br/>\n&gt; our family&#39;s commitment to the unschooling vision, we have no plans to<br/>\n&gt; put him in preschool. We feel these are the most important years *not*<br/>\n&gt; to place a child in an educational program, due to the delicate nature<br/>\n&gt; of the unfolding mind.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since telling a few friends about the upcoming increase in our family<br/>\n&gt; size and sudden change from a family of 1 to a family of 3, we have<br/>\n&gt; been bombarded with advice:  That even though my son didn&#39;t like going<br/>\n&gt; with a swim instructor when he was 2, he has grown and may now really<br/>\n&gt; like preschool (being away from a home based life).  That he may<br/>\n&gt; resent the babies as they grow and say &quot;Oh, now they&#39;re awake---now i<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t do this project with you mom&quot;, and that he will get a lot out of<br/>\n&gt; being with kids his age who do not compete for his mothers&#39; attention.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find myself rather defensive to these remarks from well-meaning<br/>\n&gt; friends.  I want to try to keep my son at home, even though i know he<br/>\n&gt; will get less of me during the year he has just turned 4. Caring for<br/>\n&gt; two babies will be time consuming.  I feel hopeful however that it<br/>\n&gt; will be enriching for my son, somehow.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions or experience with keeping life passionate and<br/>\n&gt; stimulating for a 4 year old while we all adjust to big family<br/>\n&gt; changes?

Yes, it was a big<br/>\nadjustment, but also enriching for all of us. Some of the best advice I got<br/>\nwas &quot;give yourself 6 weeks for things to settle out after the baby is born&quot;,<br/>\nand I would add to that &quot;then give yourself 6 more weeks, then 6 more weeks,<br/>\nthen...&quot; :-) It seems that every month or two with a new baby (or in your<br/>\ncase two) comes with new challenges. As some things get easier, something<br/>\nelse gets harder. At first when the babes are little, they will spend a lot<br/>\nof time nursing or napping and so you can most likely get lots of books read<br/>\nwhile nursing or lying down with the babies. Then as they become more alert,<br/>\nthere will be times when they will sit or lie near you and you can do crafts<br/>\nstuff on the floor - they won&#39;t be mobile enough to put beads or playdough<br/>\nin their mouth. Once they become mobile, things get trickier. If you&#39;re<br/>\nlucky, they will have settled into some sort of predictable nap routine and<br/>\npossibly you can do stuff with your oldest then, otherwise some stuff will<br/>\nhave to be shelved until they&#39;re past the oral stage. At around 1 year, they<br/>\nreally get into imitating mom, so we&#39;ve found that this is a good age to do<br/>\nprojects together, like cooking and cleaning where we all do it together. I<br/>\ngive my babe some measuring cups and flour to play with and she thinks she<br/>\nis &quot;baking&quot; too. I also got some small baking stuff (rolling pins, wooden<br/>\nspoons) from IKEA for cheap and she uses those to &quot;cook&quot;. Or we sweep the<br/>\nfloors or dust together. Everything takes forever, but that&#39;s the way it is<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, your son will get less of your time, you will most likely feel guilty,<br/>\nhe will sometimes feel angry or upset. OTOH, he will get siblings which can<br/>\nbe a great joy in themselves. I love to watch my kiddos playing together and<br/>\nI also know as my daughter&#39;s imagination begins to bloom they will have more<br/>\nand more fun together. Yes, preschool can give you a break to have time just<br/>\nto parent the two babes, but it also will add some stresses (schedule,<br/>\ndriving with babies in carseats), and it will remove your son from this new<br/>\nfamily that is his reality. I think it&#39;s much less stressful on the child to<br/>\nhave them be an active part of their new sibling&#39;s lives. I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nmissed all the special moments between my son and our baby daughter for<br/>\nanything (of course, now that she can get into his legos and wreck his train<br/>\nlayouts, it&#39;s a bit tougher, LOL!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as activities go, if you get a double-stroller you can take the<br/>\nkiddos out in the great museum of life - out for nature walks and such. It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even have to be anywhere especially important as a destination. My<br/>\nson&#39;s favorite site last summer was a cluster of trees in an empty lot that<br/>\nhe dubbed &quot;The acorn fairy trees&quot;. We would walk or bike there and I would<br/>\nsit and nurse my daughter in the shade and he would make little beds from<br/>\nacorn shells for the fairies - these are some of the best memories of last<br/>\nsummer and it didn&#39;t involve any great amount of thought or energy, just a<br/>\nfew snacks and a walk to a small spot. You can help your son create sacred<br/>\nspaces - we&#39;ve piled up pillows in the hall to make a special fort for my<br/>\nson, or gone to special places outdoors he likes - and tell stories about<br/>\nthese places. That doesn&#39;t involve a book or any other accoutrements, only<br/>\nyour imagination and voice. I&#39;ve also found that singing helps keep life<br/>\ninteresting and more peaceful around here - we have songs for everything<br/>\n(cooking, cleaning, bedtime, teeth brushing, baths, meals), and sometimes<br/>\ngetting into a routine (not enforced or rigid, but as a guideline) can help<br/>\nkeep everyone&#39;s sanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you, you know that you will get lots of support for your<br/>\ndecision to keep your family at home together here!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;An archeologist is someone interested in old<br/>\nbones, like Grandma&#39;s!!&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who her brother calls &quot;turbo baby&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kerry Kibort","from":"Kerry Kibort &lt;kkibort@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ep2UPuim75nqS3aIkZHzXiJszeIoPdCD5WCCtRoAwBYsV0ZIfgqz8UjTqco_T2tCr6kOTGLIqqsOkqACYAjwYnGm_rv1WUs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] can i do this??","postDate":"979474510","msgId":15073,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTE0MTIxNTEwLjU3MDY3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwMDYubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15072,"nextInTopic":15075,"prevInTime":15072,"nextInTime":15074,"topicId":15063,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Did it ever occur to your well meaning friends that shoving your son out the door as soon as the babies get there will send a message of got new babies now,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-472338849\">Did it ever occur to your &quot;well meaning&quot; friends that<br/>\nshoving your son out the door as soon as the babies<br/>\nget there will send a message of &quot;got new babies now,<br/>\ndont need you&quot; to him?

Let him watch you parent and love <br/>\nyour twins. He will learn a much more valuable lesson from you. He will <br/>\nlearn what it is to be responsible for someone else. These are the virtues <br/>\nthat will help him grow to be a wonderful man. I am the mother of 4. My <br/>\nhusband delivered my youngest at home with the other 3 looking on.
