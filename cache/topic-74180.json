The first year we<br/>\nmoved out of district, the second year I guess they just forgot us and<br/>\nthe third year we tested thru Family Learning Org. for my ds (state<br/>\nrequirement for 8th grade, tho we don&#39;t really do grades), I didn&#39;t<br/>\nneed to worry about doing anyting for my dd becuz she was under six.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was glad we did the testing tho becuz somebody recently turned me in<br/>\nfor educational neglect and I was able to show the social worker ds&#39;s<br/>\ntest scores. Ds is really into body boarding and surfing, we live on<br/>\nthe beach and I guess it upsets some people to see him out there in<br/>\nthe water so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this year dd will be six and I know from other&#39;s that the<br/>\nelementary school doesn&#39;t forget hs&#39;ers and I have to report to the<br/>\nhigh school for ds so I&#39;m looking for an easy way to handle the<br/>\nreporting part of hs&#39;ing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to hear how you folks handle this. I hate doing paper work<br/>\nand wouldn&#39;t do anything if I had my way. I know my kids are learning<br/>\nand don&#39;t really worry about it, could care less about the<br/>\neducationalese of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA.
