He is dying to see her in the shower. Can&#39;t understand why the girls are allowed in the bathroom to brush their teeth when Tara is showering and she won&#39;t let him in. She won&#39;t let him in because he tries to look at her. Tara is uncomfortable with that. She calls him a little perv. Only to me of course. But her feelings about it are strong. As much as I tell her it&#39;s natural for him to be curious, she doesn&#39;t like it. So I try to get him to respect that part of her. Tonight he planted himself in the bathroom before Tara was to shower and said he wasn&#39;t leaving until she got in. It was kind of funny really. Anyway, I talked to him and he&#39;s really curious about what she looks like. Not sure if it&#39;s just her or a body he&#39;s interested in. Of course then Sierra pipes in and wants to see penis&#39; too. It&#39;s to the point where Joseph will mention it just about every day. I asked him if he wanted me to go and get him a book and that seemed to be exciting to him. Of course Sierra wanted to know if she could see too. Am I going in the right direction here?
