A day after can mean waking up angry at everyone, screaming <br/>\ndemands and being generally unpleasant. Sometimes he even wakes in <br/>\nthe night, screaming and crying, but nothing helps other than <br/>\nholding him and waiting it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, if I get the other kids situated with something they <br/>\nenjoy, I can take him all alone and rub his back, cuddle, feed him, <br/>\nread some books and the rest of the day gets better...not always.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days seem more like trying to run distraction constantly. <br/>\nGetting him alone is the best &quot;medicine&quot;, but it doesn&#39;t always <br/>\nsolve the day.<br/>\nThere are children that are more intense than others, I try to look <br/>\nat them as moments, but some days I&#39;m fairly exhausted by the end of <br/>\nthe day.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gets better and better as he gets older.  When he was three, I <br/>\nspent most all of my energy being present for him and trying to give <br/>\nthe  other kids attention....it gets easier, I promise.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110564,"nextTopicId":11892}}
