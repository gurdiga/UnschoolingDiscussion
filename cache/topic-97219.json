What I have done when they ask me to play stuff I don&#39;t want to (which is usually make-believe stuff as well - the pretending and Barbies and voices and all), is tell them that I love to play games (board games), read books, bike, blow bubbles, play chase.....I give them a list of things I do enjoy doing. As I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m realising that this list has grown over the years.  Perhaps, as I accepted where I was at with &quot;playing&quot; with my kids, I&#39;ve learned to enjoy even more.  I think the list may have initially been just reading books!  I still don&#39;t like make-believe, but I do feel more flexible now than I did before.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Anyways, when I was reading your post about feeling like a terrible parent, my heart went out to you.  I can&#39;t think of a parent I know that hasn&#39;t felt that, many, many times.  It feels terrible!  Especially when we feel absolutely sure that it&#39;s true.  Someone told me something the other day that really helped - maybe you&#39;ll feel inspired too.  &quot;Don&#39;t compare your insides to somebody&#39;s outsides&quot;.  Brilliant, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n      Best wishes!<br/>\n<br/>\n      Michele<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n        <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97208,"nextTopicId":97223}}
