I <br/>\nreally hate the argument that if you don&#39;t limit what kids watch they will go <br/>\nall out and watch porn and violent movies all the time. That is so very untrue! <br/>\nI don&#39;t know one young child who would do that, things like that don&#39;t <br/>\ninterest them. What six year old is going to want to watch things like that? Maybe it <br/>\nmight be an issue with older kids, but Sandra has said often enough that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have problems with her boys doing that, and that if they do express <br/>\ninterest in sex related themes on the computer, TV, movies, magazines, books <br/>\nthat she has spoken with them that they respect others in the house and keep it <br/>\nto themselves. How much more healthy can you get than that? I think that kids <br/>\nwatch TV programs and movies based on their interests. When mine were younger <br/>\nthey watched things like Barney (who I can&#39;t stand, but hey whatever! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;)Tellytubbies, Rollie Pollie Ollie, Out of the Box, Sesame Street... things like <br/>\nthat. Now they watch Disney movies, Sponge Bob, G Gundum (sp?), Moly likes some <br/>\nof the &quot;teen&quot; Nick and &quot;teen&quot; Disney shows, that are really for preteens. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Darin and I want to watch a movie that we think may have things in it that <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be appropriate for kids our kids ages, we wait until they are in <br/>\nbed. Nuf said!! The other day I was watching a movie called Bobbie&#39;s Girl (I <br/>\nthink that is what it was called) about two lesbians and one had inherited her <br/>\nnephew after his parents died, and then she discovered she had breast cancer. It <br/>\nwas a wonderful movie. Moly watched most of it with me. (she came in about 30 <br/>\nminutes into it) She asked me all sorts of questions about what it means to be <br/>\na lesbian. I was so glad she saw this movie that portrayed women as a family <br/>\nin such a light. There was no sex, there were some tender intimate moments. It <br/>\nshowed the women owning their own business, raising a child, dealing with <br/>\ncancer, just like any other family. It didn&#39;t show lesbianism as just some <br/>\nfantasy for men to get their kicks. I was so happy because Moly had lots of <br/>\nquestions. And I was glad that her first view of a family different from hers was <br/>\nshown in such a way. So I don&#39;t limit, I watch with my kids, I talk to them, I <br/>\nrespect their emotional development and keep things I want to see for later.

Porn is off limits, as is gratuitous, realistic violence (&quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;American History X&quot; are examples of movies we deem inappropriate: The Sopranos would be a TV show in the &quot;forbidden&quot; category). Mind you, my kids have never asked to watch them, or that type of show. I don&#39;t like them watching MTV or what have you, because of the objectification of women, but I try hard not to censor that, and I have discussions with them about the inappropriateness of some of the videos. They seem to understand that my problem is not so much with the shows or videos themselves, rather the tendency to idolize the actors/ performers in them. I like Eminem, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s an appropriate role model for my children, kwim? <br/>\nWendy<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The sheeplike tendency of human society soon makes inroads on a child&#39;s unsophistications, and then popular education completes the dastardly work with its systematic formulas, and away goes the individual, hurtling through space into that hateful oblivion of mediocrity.
