We rescued a puppy who was full of mange. We took her to the <br/>\nvet on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The kids were asking <br/>\nquestions like crazy. Then the vets assistant took us in the back to <br/>\nshow us all the animals that had been rescued. Like the mini horse <br/>\nwho had its ears chewed off by dogs.. YIKES we saw the stitch marks <br/>\nand everything. THen there was a cat that someone had dropped <br/>\nsomething heavy on its head.. It looked like a cartoon cat with its <br/>\neyes bulging, but way not funny. We left with a mange free pup and a <br/>\nrat.. We like rats.. Then we were only 15 miles till the Blackfeet <br/>\nMuseum. I suggested we go on. Everyone agreed and we arrived in <br/>\nbitter wind at exactly the time it was due to open. But it didn&#39;t. <br/>\nThere is a thing called indian time. Not meant as a racial slur it <br/>\nis just culturally looser. We sat for about a half an hour.. Only <br/>\nvan in the lot..
