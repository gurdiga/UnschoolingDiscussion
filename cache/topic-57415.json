I think TV effects people differently<br/>\ndepending on what state their mind is in when they sit down to watch any<br/>\ngiven show. When a child (or adult for that matter) is watching<br/>\ntelevision to relax, I don&#39;t think their brain is registering all it sees<br/>\nand hears, leaving them more susceptible to subliminal messages and mind<br/>\ncontrol. When the television is used as a resource, the brain is focused,<br/>\nabsorbing all it sees and hears, searching for the desired information or<br/>\neffect. When my children watch TV throughout the day (usually videos)<br/>\nthey can interact, or learn or just plain enjoy a show. But if I sit them<br/>\ndown to watch a show while I&#39;m making dinner or something (the electronic<br/>\nbabysitter) they will get in a zombie like state where they can&#39;t even<br/>\nhear you calling them. And when the show is over, they don&#39;t have a clue<br/>\nas to what they even saw. Pretty scary, and needless to say, I don&#39;t<br/>\nencourage this kind of TV viewing. I think it is the same with adults.<br/>\nI&#39;ve watched movies when I was tired and relaxed, and then I have watched<br/>\nthe same movie intently when I was alert and interested. I came away with<br/>\ntwo entirely different *feelings* after each time. I don&#39;t know exactly<br/>\nscientifically why, but I don&#39;t think it is an accident. <br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57402,"nextTopicId":57416}}
