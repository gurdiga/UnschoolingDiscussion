When my <br/>\nson was 12, his little brother was only 3.  There was no way I would be <br/>\nhappy about hearing even the most benign profanity coming out of my 3 <br/>\nyo&#39;s mouth.  Besides the &quot;Gram test&quot;, this was something I was <br/>\nabsolutely adamant about--and that if the baby said something off-color, <br/>\nI would know exactly where to find the person who taught it to him, or <br/>\nsaid it in front of him, and there would be serious consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, another way I helped him determine what was appropriate was to ask <br/>\nhim if he would like to hear that said by his baby brother.  I think <br/>\nthis helped more than the Gram test, because he truly does love his <br/>\nbrother, and had an appreciation for his innocence.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I flat out refused to buy any music for him that I found <br/>\nobjectionable.  He could certainly buy it for himself if he had money, <br/>\nbut since he wasn&#39;t willing to work for much money, he rarely had enough <br/>\nto buy CDs.  That was my form of &quot;censoring&quot; what he listened to, in the <br/>\nsame way I&#39;ve never purchased a toy gun. (Yet, there have always been <br/>\ntoy guns here!)  I&#39;ve never censored his music choice since he started <br/>\nworking for money at 14.  I simply require that he not expose his now 8 <br/>\nyo brother to (most) of it.  :)  He does like a lot of cool music.  He <br/>\nturned me on to Dave Matthews, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worried, too...what kind of kid was I raising?  It&#39;s just better that <br/>\nhe can be home and explore that side of things where he can get guidance <br/>\nand feedback that isn&#39;t necessarily agreeable with the ideas in the <br/>\nmusic.  I think, at least for my son, it&#39;s a phase.  Both of my older <br/>\nboys have gone (are going) through it.  But they&#39;re also kind and <br/>\nsensitive and don&#39;t hate women, nor are they racists (two of the reasons <br/>\nI despise Eminem).

It was a nightmare to sort out all <br/>\nthe replies the way it turned out.  Here is the original post I sent <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt; I am having trouble deciding in general where one draws lines. No matter <br/>\nhow <br/>\nmuch personal freedom one would like to give their children, it seems there <br/>\nis always a point at which one has to think about what is too much. My 12 <br/>\nyear old is very strong willed and seems to enjoy being shocking at times. He <br/>\nis also very angry. How do I tell him that though we are supposed to have <br/>\nfreedom of speech I do not want him to listen to say &quot;Eminem&quot; or some of <br/>\nthe other rap artists that use very strong and sexual language? Obviously, I <br/>\ncan tell him, it is a retorical question really. It is difficult to ban <br/>\nsuch things because I cannot stop his being exposed to them. He has decided <br/>\nrecently to explore song writing and has produced a couple of songs I just <br/>\nplain find disturbing. One is about some person finding his girlfriend in <br/>\nbed with another guy, and the other is about how life sucks, repleat with <br/>\nreally strong language. I asked him if it bothered him that other people <br/>\nmight really be put off by his choice of language and he says he couldn&#39;t <br/>\ncare less about that...Says it is aimed at all those kids that have made fun <br/>\nof him. (he is slightly overweight and hates it, partly why he is not going <br/>\nback to PS as usual anymore)<br/>\nI am not sure what I am asking here really except that I find myself not <br/>\nknowing what to say to him or how to react to this brand of creativity. I <br/>\ncan understand the acting out of anger but gee I would hate to be raising <br/>\nanother Eminem.
