I get extremely bored with my surroundings, what <br/>\nI&#39;m doing, whatever, and I have to make a change.  I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve only <br/>\nbeen married twice.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually make jobs last more than 3 months, though.  Unless it&#39;s a temp job. <br/>\n I walked out of a temp job a couple of years ago.  Secretly spirited my <br/>\noffice plants away, left for lunch and never went back.  I was so INCREDIBLY <br/>\nbored.  But they all loved me there so much that I had negotiated reduced <br/>\nhours (the work was too easy for me).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also move a lot.  The longest I&#39;ve been in any one house is 5 years, <br/>\nalthough I&#39;ve lived in the same city for 10 (with a little break to somewhere <br/>\nelse in between).  Luckily I married someone who grew up in the Air Force, so <br/>\nhe&#39;s not averse.  My kids have suffered in some ways, but I believe they have <br/>\nbenefitted, as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never thought that I would be one to travel a lot.  But I did start <br/>\ntravelling about 8 years ago, and it has made a heck of a difference.  I just <br/>\nneed to get outta Dodge every once in a while, and it helps me not want to <br/>\nmove entirely.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to rationalize all the moves and discontent as circumstantial, but as <br/>\nI look back now on 20 years of it, I can see that it&#39;s a pattern for me.  It <br/>\nwould be good to know exactly why it&#39;s so appealing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, I&#39;m going back to work (temporarily &lt;g&gt;).  Dh wants to start a <br/>\nside business this year, and the economy has his job on the edge, so we&#39;re <br/>\ntrying to get our ducks in a row.
