That journey varies on many things, some being, how long they <br/>\nwere spanked, how old were they when spanking began and how old they were <br/>\nwhen it ended, what are the spanker views *to the child* ABOUT spanking now, <br/>\nthe reactions and words from the adult (spanker) as he&#39;s acting different <br/>\nstuff out on his journey back, and maybe most important, what kind of child <br/>\nis it. (As in Temperament.) (There&#39;s a GREAT book on temperament; <br/>\nUnderstanding your child&#39;s Temperament&quot; by William B. Carey M.D.) So, I say y<br/>\nour right in thinking it came from him formally being spanked, and that you <br/>\njust need to keep chugging along in your violence free and loving home, and <br/>\nit will come together. It&#39;s a journey though, the ramifications of spanking <br/>\naren&#39;t just gone the day you decided to stop spanking.
