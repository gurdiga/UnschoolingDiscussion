The only parties I got invited to were <br/>\nthe ones that the whole class was invite regardless and I made alot of <br/>\nfriends in the area when my parents were driving us to school as we did not <br/>\nhave busses. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI was extremely shy in school and wouldn&#39;t talk. I too, had one friend.(BTW, <br/>\nthis &quot;one friend&quot;, lived right across the street from me and wasn&#39;t even in <br/>\nmy &quot;grade&quot;, so with or without school, she would have been my friend) I went <br/>\nto p.s. for 13 years. Now, if the socialization of school is so wonderful, <br/>\nyou would think that I eventually would have made friends in school and <br/>\nbecome &quot;less shy&quot; around people, right?<br/>\nWRONG! If anything, it got lots worse. The other children started &quot;teasing&quot; <br/>\nme about being shy, which made me even MORE shy. I was fine at home with my <br/>\nsiblings. I was very loud and outspoken. Also, I did things and went places <br/>\nand had fun with my one friend. By the time I was in high school, I was <br/>\nbegging my mom to let me &quot;drop out&quot;. (The teasing gets alot more cruel in the <br/>\nhigher grades, folks).<br/>\nBy the time I was 16, I was suicidal and mom decided I needed a Psychiatrist. <br/>\nGee, it&#39;s funny how my life got better after I &quot;graduated&quot; and became an <br/>\nadult. I&#39;m not shy anymore (although it took me a few years) and I talk to <br/>\npeople all the time now.<br/>\nSo, the question is: Did school teach me socialization? No, it almost killed <br/>\nme. <br/>\nThe bottom line is: School hurts innocent children. Thirteen years of <br/>\n&quot;socialization&quot; and only one friend and I almost killed myself in the <br/>\nprocess...yeah, socialization is the greatest.<br/>\nMary Ellen.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"metta@xxxxxxxxxx.xxx","from":"metta@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ndOWXJmzI2bZdNIDjlMxVk-CXNVdCVgcquuQ_cybiWkPMAvTK0VxW1AwA9AGgEWWI6Y_OK3DBwNR-hI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Shout it to the World","postDate":"928439197","msgId":323,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy40NC4zMjMuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":311,"nextInTopic":406,"prevInTime":322,"nextInTime":324,"topicId":268,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

First off my kids are little so I have no experience in hsing.  We have recently decided that this is the best decision for our kids.  Someone said that unschooling starts from birth, I truly believe that based on what I have did with my kids since they were born.  Unschooling will be an extension of what I already do.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to deal with the family....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mom was very pro about the idea at first with all the shootings in schools.  Her comment was I&#39;ll even buy the books.  My Dad said not to isolate the kids because of some whackos.  I am the type of person who likes to tell everyone about something cool I am doing or planning to do.  If I put a voice to my idea, it becomes easier.  This method has been very helpful with my business as well.  I am proud and excited that we have decided to hs our kids.  From reading everyone&#39;s input on this and various other lists, I feel empowered by all of your experiences and confident that I can do this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to my Mom, now that it is a serious plan in action, she has given me the socialization lecture.

Stick to it??  This isn&#39;t a new diet I am trying, this is my children&#39;s lives were are talking about here!!   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter just turned 2.  In just 2 weeks my whole perspective has changed about our lives.  Thank God for hsing and unschooling!!  I can go on from here feeling good that I am picking the right course for our lives and that my kids are not in danger of having the same sort of childhood I had.  I know that there will be tough days, but are there always.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that my point is that we all are making the best decisions for our families and we will always know that in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to unload, but I had to add my voice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie G.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":327,"nextTopicId":408}}
