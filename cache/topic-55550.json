I just wonder how can someone ask about homeopathy if they<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know what homeopathy can help with? Most people haven&#39;t even heard about<br/>\n&gt; homeopathy, ever.

You are definitely right<br/>\nthat not everyone knows what it is, and hence couldn&#39;t ask directly about<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, I won&#39;t post anymore, ok?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve already said you wouldn&#39;t but you still are, so I&#39;m assuming you LIKE<br/>\nbeing here and have things to say.
