Does anyone have any more <br/>\ninfo?<br/>\nTami<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nborax or sodium tetraborate decahydrate (s�dm t��trb�r�t dk��h�drt) (KEY), <br/>\nchemical compound, Na2B4O7�10H2O; sp. gr. 1.73; slightly soluble in cold <br/>\nwater; very soluble in hot water; insoluble in acids. Borax is a colorless, <br/>\nmonoclinic crystalline salt; it also occurs as a white powder. It readily <br/>\neffloresces, especially on heating. It loses all water of hydration when <br/>\nheated above 320�C and fuses when heated above 740�C; a �borax bead� so <br/>\nformed is used in chemical analysis (see bead test). Borax is widely and <br/>\ndiversely used, e.g., as a mild antiseptic, a cleansing agent, a water <br/>\nsoftener, a corrosion inhibitor for antifreeze, a flux for silver soldering, <br/>\nand in the manufacture of enamels, shellacs, heat-resistant glass (e.g., <br/>\nPyrex), fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other chemicals. It is sometimes <br/>\nused as a preservative but is toxic if consumed in large doses. Naturally <br/>\noccurring borax (sometimes called tincal) is found in large deposits in the <br/>\nW United States (Borax Lake in Death Valley, Calif.; Nevada; and Oregon) and <br/>\nin the Tibet region of China. Borax can also be obtained from borate <br/>\nminerals such as kernite, colemanite, or ulexite. California is the chief <br/>\nsource of borate minerals in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cory and Amy Nelson","from":"Cory and Amy Nelson &lt;amynelson3@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"DgZKifuIH8TubLfakWPPzyhEPxxanTlkzNSRMYmrB1iS7c-C8YtIHAxivMePGBLqgBHZcU6cvw6k7S7XMrI3RkMn650qIaFOSWPaETiUJiI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] borax","postDate":"980774515","msgId":15469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2OUFDQTkzLjI0M0ElYW15bmVsc29uM0Bob21lLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGQwLjEwYjQwZjM5LjI3YTQwNjFlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15409,"nextInTopic":15471,"prevInTime":15468,"nextInTime":15470,"topicId":15409,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cath- I ve used borax a few times as a laundry booster or as a deodorizer.
