And guess what: Lots <br/>\nof those Japanese corporations working in those poorer countries have <br/>\ncontracts directly or indirectly with the Japanese government. Many <br/>\npeople in and outside Japan have been blasting the Japanese government <br/>\nfor this practice for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny how these kinds of facts conveniently get omitted from news stories <br/>\n-- and classroom curriculums as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Japanese Education Ministry&#39;s motivation for pushing ahead with this <br/>\ndubious curriculum in public schools becomes apparent in the last <br/>\nparagraph of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Covert<br/>\n(KnoK NEWS)<br/>\nin Osaka, Japan<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Daily Yomiuri - 20 June 2000]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMATERIALS TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT NATION&#39;S ODA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Foreign Ministry has produced educational materials designed to help <br/>\nchildren better understand the role Japan plays in funding aid programs <br/>\nthrough official development assistance, and has distributed the <br/>\nmaterials to 3,000 primary schools nationwide.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubtitled &quot;To Make Everyone Smile,&quot; the materials are a 22-minute video <br/>\nand a teacher&#39;s booklet, and is designed for sixth-grade students, <br/>\nministry officials said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe video discusses Japan&#39;s economic recovery after World War II and <br/>\ninternational assistance given to Japan after the Great Hanshin <br/>\nEarthquake in Kobe. It also focuses on the difficulties facing developing <br/>\ncountries, which account for about 80 percent of all the nations of the <br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that ODA from Japan, the largest ODA contributor, has been used <br/>\nto build bridges and schools in many countries is also explained in the <br/>\nvideo.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing the advice of schoolteachers, the video also contains a number <br/>\nof quizzes. The booklet accompanying the video gives three examples of <br/>\nhow to use the material in the classroom, the officials said.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the nation in the grip of a prolonged economic recession, some have <br/>\ncriticized the giving of massive amounts of ODA. However, one teacher who <br/>\nused the materials in class said that, by using the material, students <br/>\ncame to think of Japan as a good country and could take pride in being <br/>\nJapanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Copyright 2000 - The Yomiuri Shimbun]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9512,"nextTopicId":9517}}
