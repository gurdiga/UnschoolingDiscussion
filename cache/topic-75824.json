have some flexibility in their schedules. &nbsp;If their Dad sees that they are able to fit into his idea of normal he may start to relax a bit. &nbsp;And getting a sense that you are really trying to

I&#39;m afraid that my own reactions to things may lead to that feeling as well. I&#39;m horribly guilty at looking for traditional measures of their growth. Or even comparing them to others. It&#39;s something that I&#39;m working on. I have read all the responses I got so far but feel it&#39;s better to respond to one at a time. The focus on me and my attitude is very helpful because I know I&#39;m they one that needs to change and be the pillar here. <br><br>**<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\">It sounds like you have already given up on the practice of unschooling, if not the idea of it.**<br><br>I&#39;ve definitely hit the panic button after my last court hearing. Dad threatened to take me to court to have them put back in school if his guidelines weren&#39;t being met. Those guidelines were that they do school everyday and have something to show him. They must also pass any tests that he comes up with that he believes are grade appropriate in every subject. He wants them taught all the same subjects that they would be taught in school (chemisty, trig, algebra, history, social studies, English,etc). So I&#39;ve set about meeting those guidelines. I enrolled them in Time 4 Learning, and I have been trying to do school type work to get them up to the grade dad believes they should test at. I feel I&#39;d rather do this in order to keep them&nbsp; home and still give them free time to explore some of their own things than to have a court battle or have them just decide to give in and go to high school to avoid that.<br><br></span><br><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\"><br>**One clue that leads me to say that is &quot;they have never gotten interested in life as I thought they would.&quot;<br><br>I\n have noticed over years on this list that when parents say things like \nthis, it usually means that they, the parents, are not SEEING the \nlearning and the interests for various reasons, or not valuing the \nlearning or interests of their children and so dismissing them. That \nthey, the parents, have not fully understood unschooling, and the amount\n of attention it requires from the parents.</span>**<br><br>I struggle with this. Yes. I haven&#39;t fully deschooled myself. I try to not place that on my children though. As a practical point, the attention thing does make me feel guilty. Being a single mom, I don&#39;t have the time or energy that I would like to devote to their interests. I can&#39;t spend hours each day with both of them. I can&#39;t do it on their time table either. I work nights and sleep during the day. I feel guilty every time they say to me that I&#39;m sleeping. It&#39;s like they want me to go without sleep in order to do things with them. Sometimes I do. But I&#39;m not super mom, and I get really grouchy without sleep. I&#39;ve talked to them about switching to a day shift, and they prefer me to stay on this one because then I do have some flexibility to be with them during the day and do things. For instance, they wanted to volunteer at an animal shelter about an hour and a half from home. I was able to drive them, meet the staff and tour the place, then I slept in the car while they worked. I also have my mom around who is a great support as far as getting them to things. <br><br>But on a more practical note, I hear over and over again how the parent must be actively involved and provide full attention. How? How does that look? Does the parent not have a life that they live too? Is it always being on call for the kids? I keep up with what they are watching by talking to them about it because I don&#39;t have the time to sit with them through everything. The same with their time at the barn, I talk about it. I drive when I can, but I can&#39;t spend the same amount of time there that they do. I can&#39;t be with them. <br><br>**<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\">You say \n&quot;they will watch vines and tv all day&quot;. I can&#39;t tell definitively from \nyour post whether you are happy with that, or negative about it, \nalthough I think the latter. (?) Plus you have not shared any of their \nother activities.</span>**<br><br>I think it&#39;s a combination of both. I am still guilty of looking for something educational in what they do, now anyway, for years I didn&#39;t care but with the change in things here I am back at my old way of looking at things. <br>I find some of it very interesting and leading them into deeper things. Some of it I find just stupid. I don&#39;t threaten to take it away, but I&#39;m sure they can tell that I&#39;m less than happy with some of it. As for what else they do, they work at a barn (summer may make this more often. It&#39;s been slow during the winter.). They volunteer occasionally for an animal shelter. They would both like to find jobs, but because they aren&#39;t yet legal no one wants to hire them. They do a home school co-op once a week during the school year. They go to concerts that some of their friends have. They ride quads, and play outside during the warmer months. One took an interest in welding but quickly gave it up. They both have a small interest in crocheting which I&#39;m trying to show them. (I&#39;m still learning myself.) <br><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\"></span><br><br>**<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\">You came to this\n list for a bit when you first started unschooling and then left, and \nare now coming back? Is that right? If so, it&#39;s a shame not to have \nstayed around for the intervening time, not necessarily to post but just\n to read on a regular basis. You might have already had the answers to \nmost of these questions, that honestly sound like someone new to \nunschooling, not someone with 6 years at it. It also sounds like you are\n not as confident in your unschooling that you can be a bulwark for your\n twins against the critique that they are getting from their Dad.</span>**<br><br>I stayed around for about two years and read, but then life pulled me in other directions and I couldn&#39;t keep up with everything. I agree it&#39;s totally a shame that I didn&#39;t keep reading. I found I was spending more time reading about unschooling then doing things with my kids and I chose to get off the computer. I do consider myself new to unschooling. I feel like I&#39;m starting all over again in my growth. <br><br>**<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\"> It sounds like if \nthey have to do school at home, they&#39;d rather do it at school. I would \nadvise then that you continue to make your relationship with them your \npriority. **<br><br>I have been talking over the options and letting them know that I will support them in whichever they chose. They feel school may be a good answer because it&#39;s more normal. And because then dad wouldn&#39;t be giving us such a&nbsp; hard time. I try to let them know that we are going through the motions for their dad, but what they have an interest in is what&#39;s important to me. <br><br>**</span><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\">On the other \nhand, I wonder if they are showing apparent interest in the school work \nyou are having them do because what they really are interested in is \nmore connection and time doing something WITH you. </span>**<br><br>I don&#39;t do much of their work with them. I signed them up for Time 4 Learning, and they like being given a certain amount to get through every day, but I don&#39;t sit with them. They do it while I&#39;m sleeping or after I&#39;ve left for work. With things they don&#39;t understand, I take a few minutes to go over it (or they ask my mom), but we don&#39;t have &quot;class time.&quot;<br><br>**<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\">The goal of unschooling is to partner with our children, NOT expect them to learn things on their own.</span>**<br><br>This is a major failing point for me, and I know this. I&#39;ve not filled their lives with enough. I think my lack as a good unschooling parent may be a good reason for them to consider doing school at home or going to public school. I don&#39;t have the time or energy or money any more to keep ahead and strew their paths with cool things. I&#39;m just barely surviving myself. I don&#39;t have the resources to learn everything with them or be as engaging. <br><br><br>**<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\"> My 15 year old \nloves You Tubers, especially Dan and Phil and some of the Beauty \nVloggers - make up tutorials and stuff.&nbsp; I have made it a priority to \nsubscribe to Dan and Phil&#39;s several channels and watch with her, so that\n when she wants to talk about them, I get what she is saying. Plus they \nare hilarious.**<br><br>My girls like them too. But I hadn&#39;t thought of subscribing to them myself. I occasionally watch with them, but that lack of time thing comes up again. BUT you gave me the idea of watching just a few minutes on my lunch/breaks at work. I can keep up with some of it that way. Thanks<br><br><br>**</span><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840\">Unschooling is \nnot there for its own sake, or for people to unschool at all costs, just\n so that they can wave a flag for &quot;UNSCHOOLING!&quot; If it is not leading \nyou to a happier lifestyle, then it isn&#39;t. Better to be have happy \nrelationships with your kids, with them in school, than to keep them out\n against their will and have friction just because Mom liked the idea of\n being an unschooler.**<br></span><br>That would be another reason that I stopped reading so much. I was becoming attached to the idea of the title rather than what was working best for&nbsp; us. I felt I had to do it a certain way to be doing it right, and I didn&#39;t like being tied to the label. I love the idea of letting them learn what they are interested in at their own pace. They aren&#39;t nearly as comfortable with that now. I think part of it is age, part of it is the family situation and part of it is societal pressure. Whichever way we go from here, it will be because we&#39;ve talked about it and have decided for ourselves. <br><br>Thanks Robyn for such a lengthy thought provoking response.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1632490840ygroups-quoted\">&nbsp;</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] back again now with teens","postDate":"1429290412","msgId":75833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3QzBGQjNGLUIzODQtNENEMy1CNjRCLTIxMzVERTg2OUE3MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDczOTQ5MDE0LUU4ODgtNDIwRC04NjU5LUZBNTBENjAzQjE5QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG1ncDlicisxbzg2dWVxQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDczOTQ5MDE0LUU4ODgtNDIwRC04NjU5LUZBNTBENjAzQjE5QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75832,"nextInTopic":75837,"prevInTime":75832,"nextInTime":75834,"topicId":75824,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-This is written for the benefit of others here.

If so, it&#39;s a shame not to have stayed around for the intervening time, not necessarily to post but just to read on a regular basis. You might have already had the answers to most of these questions, that honestly sound like someone new to unschooling, not someone with 6 years at it. It also sounds like you are not as confident in your unschooling that you can be a bulwark for your twins against the critique that they are getting from their Dad.<br><br>However you say have a nice relationship with them, which you may be jeopardizing with all this school pushing. It sounds like if they have to do school at home, they&#39;d rather do it at school.

Ask for ideas from them about how they might meet those, and still have the time to enjoy their current activities, whatever those might be - including time to watch tv etc. My 15 year old loves You Tubers, especially Dan and Phil and some of the Beauty Vloggers - make up tutorials and stuff.  I have made it a priority to subscribe to Dan and Phil&#39;s several channels and watch with her, so that when she wants to talk about them, I get what she is saying. Plus they are hilarious.<br><br>They might enjoy some of the online courses, such as things at Khan Academy (free!), which still puts the onus on themselves to work at their own pace, in whatever order they like, and anytime they like - instead of you taking on an authoritarian role. <br><br>But whether they like that idea or not, be ready to spend even more time with them, listening to their interests, being fascinated by their fascinations, and connecting, as their friend and partner.<br><br>As for meeting other teens, there are the annual Not Back to School Camps (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nbtsc.org/\">http://nbtsc.org</a> ), the camps in East Tennessee, ARGH, several unschooling conferences around the country (Life is Good, NE Unschooling Conference, Free to Be are three I have been to that have strong teen presence) and often local group camp outs, and groups that often have teen groups too. Other places to meet teens include clubs or events based on their interests. For example, my daughter is interested in Vidcon, a convention about You Tubers.<br><br>OH. It just occurred to me that sometimes immersive TV watching to the exclusion of other things can be a reaction to trauma - like a healing period. It might be that they are reacting to your divorce, which certainly must have been traumatic for them too, with what looks like &quot;not interested in life&quot;. If your marriage relationship was troubled for a long time, that would effect unschooling also. Seen in that light, it is actually part of healing, part of making a safe cocoon of reliability and predictability, a safe escape.
