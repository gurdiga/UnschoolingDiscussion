Well it is too frequent","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-334081947\">I have broken my leg again.  The last time was in July, 1985, so breaking it <br/>\nagain October 11th 2002 isn&#39;t TOO frequent, I guess.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell it is too frequent because it inconveniences a lot of people and puts <br/>\nmuch of our everyday lives at a standstill.  Keith was saintly the first time <br/>\nand we didnâ€™t have any children yet.  This time the kids will get much of the <br/>\nworkload, with Keith still being saintly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big inconvenience this time was I was in South Carolina to speak at a <br/>\nhomeschooling conference, and I was on my way to the opening remarks and <br/>\nintro, after which I was doing a keynote speech.  I had a talk and a workshop <br/>\nscheduled for Saturday, a workshop for Sunday and the farewell address.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween the second floors of the two buildings in the hotel was a ramp.  Too <br/>\nsteep, too slippery, some kind of indoor/outdoor carpet on it, and I went <br/>\ndown.  This wasn&#39;t the foot I sprained a month ago, but the other one, the <br/>\nleft one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was not far behind me, several people were on the little patio at the <br/>\nend of the ramp. Paramedics came.  Nice women, smart, friendly, but they had <br/>\na gurney that only cranked down to about 18&quot; off the ground.  I was afraid to <br/>\nstand up on the lately-sprained left foot, ON that ramp, still slippery, so <br/>\nthey got firemen to put me on the gurney.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first ambulance ride!  One of the homeschooling moms, Kathryn, went with <br/>\nme.  They took me  to a VERY near hospital, a mile or less up the road, <br/>\nPalmetto Baptist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent several hours in a little closed room in the emergency area, hoping I <br/>\ncould have surgery that evening.  It seemed possible, but didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>\nX-rays showed breaks just above the ankle on both bones.  (Not nearly as bad <br/>\nas the 1985 breaks.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not happy thatI was going to miss the first alternative homeschooling <br/>\nconference in the southeastern U.S., and I felt horrible for letting people <br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSurgery was noon Saturday and I hoped that I could leave the next afternoon <br/>\nin a wheelchair to at least do the closing speech, or that maybe the hotel <br/>\ncould bring conference people in a bus to some big room at the hospital or <br/>\nSOMETHING, but on Sunday I was sick from post-op this&#39;n&#39;that, and throwing <br/>\nup.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a dozen visitors, all of whom assured me that although I was missed, <br/>\nthe conference was wonderful and people were meeting others and learning a <br/>\nton.  That was good to hear, but also sad because I wasn&#39;t getting to meet <br/>\neveryone, and the morphine drip was keeping me from being equally alert at <br/>\nall times.  I was zoning out, but it was keeping the pain down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty sat in on the panel discussion in my place, and seemed really happy <br/>\nabout having done so.  He made a good impression on lots of people there.  I <br/>\nheard reports about how good he was at helping the younger kids with games, <br/>\nthat he seemed more mature than they expected of a thirteen year old, and <br/>\nthat he was handling the stress very well.  I was grateful to people for <br/>\nbringing him to see me in the hospital, and we talked on the phone some too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of this accident , the hotel will make concessions for next year&#39;s <br/>\nconference, I hope, and the room Marty and I had, he stayed in free for four <br/>\nnights.   Anne Ohman was right next door to Marty and Joyce Fetteroll past <br/>\nthat.  Mary Gold was down a couple of floors.  They all helped Marty out on <br/>\nthe weekend, and Anne and Joyce had video-game-playing kids with them, and so <br/>\nthere was some good interaction about that, some sight-seeing, some trips to <br/>\ngood kid-food places (since they had a van).    So IF they fix that ramp and <br/>\nare as  helpful to Kelly Lovejoy, our hostess and organizer, as they need to <br/>\nbe, we&#39;ll try again next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly, thank you for ALL your help, and the ride to the airport.  Even though <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t &quot;a good weekend&quot; for me, I had a great time being with you and your <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe flew home as scheduled, with me being carried up the steps in a special <br/>\nchair to the Canadair jet, and down (flight to Cincinnatti) and then helped <br/>\ninto a first class seat on the 737 for the rest of the flight home.  My foot <br/>\ndidn&#39;t hurt as much as I had been afraid it would, I didn&#39;t get woozy, and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to try to use an airplane bathroom, so my fears were happily <br/>\n<br/>\nunmet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the four flat levels of the house, I&#39;ve been stationed in the den so I can <br/>\nget to &quot;the cat bathroom&quot; and the office, but the first night home I was in <br/>\nmy OWN bed, next to Keith, and that was good.  It was dark and quiet and the <br/>\nmattress and pillow weren&#39;t plastic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll probably end up deleting some of the yahoogroups mail because it&#39;s quite <br/>\npiled up.  It might take me a bit to get through all the personal mail too, <br/>\nbut I figured one report on this to everyone would keep me from having to <br/>\nretell it (because it hurts my leg and my feelings every time I tell it) and <br/>\nit will give people a heads up on why I might be flakey or a no-show in the <br/>\nnext few weeks.  (Kathy, we need to reschedule that lunch; Helena, I can&#39;t do <br/>\na Jasmine pick-up or delivery as I should have; Jeff and Mike, music practice <br/>\nwill need to be here or not at all for a while, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo weight on it for six weeks is what they told me in South Carolina.  I <br/>\nguess maybe that means after six weeks I can get a walking cast, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow.  I guess I&#39;ll see a Lovelace ortho-guy next week to see x-rays and get <br/>\na preview of my coming weeks.  They put pins in one bone and a plate and pins <br/>\nin the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m not happy, but I&#39;m safe at home and will try not to bring down the <br/>\nhappiness of those around me.  I can only sit up a while at a time now.  I <br/>\nhave a wheelchair and a walker.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen some of the photos of me are available, I&#39;ll put them on a website so <br/>\nyou can see me downed on the ground, and in the hospital if you want more of <br/>\nthe full effect.   I&#39;ve been to South Carolina twice now, and been in the <br/>\nhospital both times (well, the first time my parents were living in Aiken and <br/>\nwent across the border to Augusta, Georgia, for my birth, so maybe that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t count).   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really sorry for the inconveniences this will cause in the coming weeks.  <br/>\nI have movies to watch and books to read and kids to hang out with, and I&#39;ll <br/>\nbe able to sit at the computer longer as time goes on, so I&#39;m not lonely in a <br/>\nquiet home alone at all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll o&#39;ya&#39;ll be careful walking on wet ramps.  (Add that to your list of <br/>\nthings to watch out for.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n10/17/02</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47423,"nextTopicId":47427}}
