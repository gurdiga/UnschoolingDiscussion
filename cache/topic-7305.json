Forcing it on him definitely wouldn&#39;t  be the choice either-- <br/>\n(might as well send him to school).  However, I got a  discontinued wallpaper <br/>\nsample book where all the pages are very neutral with very little print.  I <br/>\nam going to introduce it as a giant scrapbook to my boys and invite them to <br/>\nglue pictures and photos in it, leaves and other nature finds, and any <br/>\nartwork they may decide to create and add as well.  Because many of the pgs <br/>\nin the wallpaper book are textured, I think they might enjoy making some <br/>\nrubbings with pencil and paper,too. * As an added thought, I am just <br/>\nwondering if Mason advocated drawings in the journals due to there not being <br/>\ntoo many other options at that point in time.  I guess I mean that her ideas <br/>\ncould be modified to fit within today&#39;s  &quot;world&quot;-- disposable cameras, wide <br/>\nranges of glues, and tons of inexpensive ready made art supplies.  She could <br/>\nencourage drawing, due to portability of pencil & eraser; likewise, so much <br/>\nis easy and portable today that may not have been for her.  As I have not <br/>\nread her book yet, I may be presumptuous in this thought, but I just <br/>\nwondered.  Thanks for your input.                                               <br/>\n            Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7277,"nextTopicId":7331}}
