It is very cool in a tactile way and makes nice squeaky crackly noises<br/>\nwhen squeezed, from the tiny foam bits. It also can be sculpted<br/>\n3-dimensionally in a way that resembles modeling clay rather than Play Doh,<br/>\nand then the pieces will slowly dry solid retaining their bright colors. The<br/>\npieces stick together in the modeling process much better than play doh or<br/>\nclay - which is why it can cover stuff. I notice a picture of it being used<br/>\non shoes on the website - I would suspect that is going a bit far - I don&#39;t<br/>\nrecall the dried product having really enough flexibility to stay stuck and<br/>\nnot chip off after a while in that kind of usage. However YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh it&#39;s been ages since we had any and I am enthusing myself about getting<br/>\nsome more! <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly problem - the seal on the containers has to be *very* good or the stuff<br/>\nwill dry out in the box or bag.
