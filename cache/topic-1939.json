I remember when I was in<br/>\nthe first grade, I had been placed in a special class that year. There were<br/>\ntoo many students so they made a new class out of the sharpest tacks in the<br/>\nbox.  (This is back before my brain turned to mush) I remember knowing I was<br/>\nbright and that expectations were high. I did really well, sometimes the<br/>\nbest in the class, in every subject, but one....Penmanship!!! I tried and<br/>\ntried to make neat little block letters like Tina and Wayne but no matter<br/>\nhow hard I tried or how much time I put into it I couldn&#39;t get more than a<br/>\nfew neat little letters on the page before it would degenerate into crooked<br/>\ncurves.  I guess this is a point about penmanship and the &#39;gifted&#39; label<br/>\nbecause not being able to write neatly like all the other little drones<br/>\nreally messed with me.  In the 6th grade I remember Gene and I were the very<br/>\nbrightest math students. We always turned our papers in first and always had<br/>\nthe most answers right, even the story problems (in 9th grade algebra when<br/>\nthe teacher would post on the board that 1 or 2 students had got a really<br/>\nhigh score the whole class would yell Mary and/or Gene) BUT, no matter how<br/>\nhard I tried, no matter how fast I went, Gene always got his done just a<br/>\nhair faster and such pretty, neat little numbers and symbols! My math sheet<br/>\nwould always be so messy.  This was the year I discovered that even though I<br/>\nwas the brightest in math, English, reading, science and especially social<br/>\nstudies (teacher gave essay questions, my specialty) I ranked in the middle<br/>\nor below on SPELLING. In the fifth grade I was also the third to the last to<br/>\nmemorize my times tables. By the way, I dropped out of high school in the<br/>\nmiddle of the 10th grade because my GPA went from a 3.84 (not a 4.  I got a<br/>\nB in Home Ec because I didn&#39;t want to study meat. sheesh) to a 3.31 between<br/>\nthe first quarter and the second because I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore.<br/>\nThe one way I was special, my &#39;giftedness&#39; was failing me and there was no<br/>\nmore reason to go to that horrid place.<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion-Can you tell I am a poor speller?

Our fundraising group always has me do <br/>\nsigns, etc., because I &quot;have such nice handwriting&quot;!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of D&#39;Nealian, when my dd was in kindergarten (the only formal IS <br/>\nshe&#39;s had) the teacher taught them this as a link between printing and <br/>\nwriting.  Her grandma had already taught her to write in cursive, and she <br/>\nalready knew how to print in manuscript, so this made 3 ways for this child <br/>\nto write.  I then took her out of IS and began to homeschool her with the <br/>\nCalvert curriculum (OK, so I didn&#39;t know better but I was just beginning, <br/>\nremember?)  THEY wanted her to learn &quot;Calvert Script&quot;.  I wrote them back and <br/>\nsaid that she already knew 3 different kinds of writing and I didn&#39;t see the <br/>\nnecessity for a 4th.  They then gave me the exquisite explanation of &quot;Those <br/>\nare our rules and we request that she use Calvert Script when doing her work&quot; <br/>\n.  That was the beginning of the end for Calvert!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSam<br/>\n(Hoping she didn&#39;t insult anyone who&#39;s using Calvert )</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joel Hawthorne","from":"Joel Hawthorne &lt;jhawthorne@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"v_WoLsaCSb3D6rDcoIx6VBvyFK25V-kjXDm5iaMEokqSOevE_uEl-Mw3Yiaz-RMIWt5YcQBneTxMIumlG_G7oFaJxExbAJsK5oWy","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Penmanship","postDate":"934502717","msgId":1945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNDkuMTk0NS45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1941,"nextInTopic":1958,"prevInTime":1944,"nextInTime":1946,"topicId":1939,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have wretched handwriting.

And my friends would keep all these letters and someday after <br/>\nmy demise they would be compiled into a best-selling book and people would <br/>\nsay, &quot;Wow, I wish I had known her.&quot;  But even if I could write beautifully <br/>\nI&#39;d probably never find the time to actually do this.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more serious note, I will say that occasionally I have to grade papers <br/>\nfrom a student with *terrible* handwriting and this drives me crazy.
