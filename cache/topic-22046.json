That helps them to understand their emotions in <br/>\na  non-judgemental way. And the tantrums are going to happen, that&#39;s <br/>\njust a fact of life with most kids this age. One thing I try to keep <br/>\nin mind is that it&#39;s not my job to make my kids happy 100% of the <br/>\ntime. I try to keep them safe, and provide lots of time for <br/>\ninteraction and fun with them, but there will always be things in <br/>\nlife that are frustrating for them that I can&#39;t solve. Now it may be <br/>\nthe fact that they want to play with the sharp knives. In 15 years <br/>\nmaybe it will be a girl they want to date that doesn&#39;t like them. I <br/>\ncan help them process their emotions, but I can&#39;t take them away. <br/>\nWhen I think of it that way, it helps me get out of the mode where <br/>\nI&#39;m trying to solve everything for them, or think that I have to <br/>\nsomehow &quot;make it all better&quot;.

My daughter (19 months) has figured out <br/>\nhow to unbuckle her seat belt. We try not to use the car too much <br/>\nright now unless she&#39;s got lots of distractions. We sing fun songs or <br/>\nI have a book she can look at along the way. If she does unbuckle, we <br/>\nobviously pull over and buckle her back in. There&#39;s not much else to <br/>\ndo, really. TTSP (this too shall pass).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLater in the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; day, my husband  has him in the basement working with him, and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>after being <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; told he cannot empty the cat litter box onto the floor, as he has <br/>\n </span></blockquote>been trying <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to do, he does it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With this kind of thing, environmental control is probably your best <br/>\nbet. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t have a toddler in the same room as a cat <br/>\nlitter box, esp. since my good friend found her toddler sitting in <br/>\ntheirs, using the scoop as a spoon... ewwwwwww.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n My husband says that he is testing him all day <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; long. I see it a bit different. . . but I am asking for solutions. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We try <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; diverting his attention but that goes nowhere. Once he sets his <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mind on <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; something, he is intent. I end up yelling at times which I hate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A few book recommendations that might help with the way you feel <br/>\nand/or react to his behavior:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When Anger Hurts Your Kids&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend any of these for giving you concrete things you can do <br/>\nto change your own side of things. Probably nothing right now is <br/>\ngoing to change *his* behavior as it is just normal age-appropriate <br/>\ntesting of limits. I know with my daughter, she&#39;ll go up and pull the <br/>\ncat&#39;s fur, the cat will get mad and swat her, and the next day she&#39;ll <br/>\ndo the same thing. So even pain and fright does not change her <br/>\nbehavior (not that I would implement those things on her, but the cat <br/>\ndoes anyways).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; afternoon he was headed for a dangerous area and I kept saying no, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and he got <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this mischievous grin and kept going until I yelled loudly, which <br/>\n </span></blockquote>made him <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stop. . . to cry. So, I am looking for alternatives that I am just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>not seeing <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I try to keep it physical when it comes to safety. If my toddler is <br/>\nheaded for something dangerous, I put myself in between it and her, <br/>\nor scoop her up, or do something to distract her, or whatever. It is <br/>\nnot their responsibility at this age to remember to protect <br/>\nthemselves from danger. It will be many years before they can take <br/>\nthis responsibility on so until then, we are the keepers of their <br/>\nsafety. Don&#39;t take his mischievous grin and behavior as an affront to <br/>\nyou or to your discipline. What he&#39;s doing is totally and completely <br/>\nnormal toddler behavior. What you can do is to keep reiterating your <br/>\nsafety rules to him (even if it seems like he&#39;s not listening, in the <br/>\nlong run it will sink in), model appropriate behavior, and be ready <br/>\nwith tools like distraction, silliness, songs, etc. in the meantime <br/>\nto help things along. Like in the carseat, now when I buckle my <br/>\ndaughter in, I sing a little tune &quot;Buckle up for SAFETY, buckle up <br/>\nfor SAFETY&quot;. When she starts unbuckling herself, I sing the same song <br/>\nand she joins along. Now she rarely tries to unbuckle herself because <br/>\nwe&#39;ve got this little song/game going. Eventually, she&#39;ll learn what <br/>\nsafety is, and like her older brother she&#39;ll make sure everyone in <br/>\nthe car is buckled in before we move!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;A bee is pollinating my eye&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Asa eat buggy&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"uqPQZ8hZHhw8lALgiky_UE16JWLvPkGwyF_wpaHM7blQxbvisoegGBTI0Oy31ziMZys26GLrnryBa5V2tFWPfd0iYBGkcnlwn_PeuGwdopVKnef_3g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Looking for Solutions","postDate":"991097050","msgId":22106,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCMTJGRUVBLjIzNzE0LjE5M0FFQkFAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYzLmFiZWI1ODkuMjg0MmYzNDdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":22057,"nextInTopic":22126,"prevInTime":22105,"nextInTime":22107,"topicId":22046,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am looking for creative solutions to something our family is experiencing \u000f with our almost 2 year old.

Jenna knows she has everyone&#39;s attention, including our two older kids. They are actually worse than we are, &#39;cause when she &quot;ooooohs&quot;, they jump! And I say, &quot;ooohs&quot;, because Jenna talks only when she wants to. Seriously. She doesn&#39;t have to, therefore she chooses not to. One of these days, this child will walk up to me and talk in complete sentences. She is extremely bright, so there&#39;s no problem. She just has a mind of her own....<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, how old are your kids? And what type of work were you able to do at home---like a home business?

He is very active, into everything, etc. He also <br/>\n  begins to cry and have tantrums when he doesnt get &quot;his way&quot;. .  ie. today <br/>\n  two things come to mind. We are in the car and he is trying to get out of his <br/>\n  car seat, and has become adept at figuring out how to almost get completely <br/>\n  out of it. We pull over, and explain to him why he cant get out (his own <br/>\n  safety) and then go on, and he continues doing the same thing. Later in the <br/>\n  day, my husband  has him in the basement working with him, and after being <br/>\n  told he cannot empty the cat litter box onto the floor, as he has been trying <br/>\n  to do, he does it anyway. My husband says that he is testing him all day <br/>\n  long. I see it a bit different. . . but I am asking for solutions. We try <br/>\n  diverting his attention but that goes nowhere. Once he sets his mind on <br/>\n  something, he is intent. I end up yelling at times which I hate. But this <br/>\n  afternoon he was headed for a dangerous area and I kept saying no, and he got <br/>\n  this mischievous grin and kept going until I yelled loudly, which made him <br/>\n  stop. . . to cry. So, I am looking for alternatives that I am just not seeing <br/>\n  at the moment. Probably things I know, but need reminding of. Thanks in <br/>\n  advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n  lovemary<br/>\n  If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then <br/>\n  make a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

This sometimes needed to be <br/>\nrepeated.  The absolute rule about seatbelts doesn&#39;t seem to bother them <br/>\nnearly as much as the car actually just stopping.  Not making progress and <br/>\njust sitting there was enough to get their attention.  I&#39;ve had this with <br/>\nboth my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kitty litter thing falls in the category of rearranging your house, imo.  <br/>\nPutting things on higher shelves and knives in their own, high, drawer, etc.  <br/>\nThat sort of thing.  Eventually, mine are now 6 and 8 yo, you don&#39;t have to <br/>\ndo so much of this.  Of course, by now, I am used to having the knives there, <br/>\nbut . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are allowed to be in charge and a mean Mom if you need to get a little <br/>\none&#39;s attention.  Picking someone up and putting them in another room is also <br/>\na good idea sometimes.  A 2 yo crying because they don&#39;t want to go somewhere <br/>\nor want to destroy something or want to do something dangerous is not <br/>\nanything to get too upset about, imo.  If you didn&#39;t do the grownup thing and <br/>\nstop them, by voice or action, then I would be upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"lite2yu@aol.com","from":"lite2yu@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"hBxfdaVbe2v7Z5NvrtFK_yNBov_Jmjbqvuv7P17GYoe_EZqUAkpP2LlZgmVMQ6gaSDbhfVq0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Looking for Solutions","postDate":"991009095","msgId":22046,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzLmFiZWI1ODkuMjg0MmYzNDdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22047,"prevInTime":22045,"nextInTime":22047,"topicId":22046,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am looking for creative solutions to something our family is experiencing with our almost 2 year old.

He is very active, into everything, etc. He also <br/>\nbegins to cry and have tantrums when he doesnt get &quot;his way&quot;. .  ie. today <br/>\ntwo things come to mind. We are in the car and he is trying to get out of his <br/>\ncar seat, and has become adept at figuring out how to almost get completely <br/>\nout of it. We pull over, and explain to him why he cant get out (his own <br/>\nsafety) and then go on, and he continues doing the same thing. Later in the <br/>\nday, my husband  has him in the basement working with him, and after being <br/>\ntold he cannot empty the cat litter box onto the floor, as he has been trying <br/>\nto do, he does it anyway. My husband says that he is testing him all day <br/>\nlong. I see it a bit different. . . but I am asking for solutions. We try <br/>\ndiverting his attention but that goes nowhere. Once he sets his mind on <br/>\nsomething, he is intent. I end up yelling at times which I hate. But this <br/>\nafternoon he was headed for a dangerous area and I kept saying no, and he got <br/>\nthis mischievous grin and kept going until I yelled loudly, which made him <br/>\nstop. . . to cry. So, I am looking for alternatives that I am just not seeing <br/>\nat the moment. Probably things I know, but need reminding of.
