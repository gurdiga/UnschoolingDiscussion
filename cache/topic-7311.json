Seem","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1499573372\">It seems as though I am in the minority when it comes to<br/>\nputting the kids to bed at 9pm.  My 9yod reads until 10pm<br/>\nbut the younger two like going to bed.  Seem to crave it.  I<br/>\ntoo am a night owl and I could easily stay up till 2am but<br/>\nit is tough to get up with the littlest ones at 7 or 8am.  I<br/>\ndid not mean to imply that late bed times are bad just that<br/>\nmy husband would like one on one time with me before he goes<br/>\nto bed at 11pm.  He is also an early bird!  I know friends<br/>\nwho home school and have late bedtimes who happen to love it<br/>\nbut there are quite a few who start their day earlier than I<br/>\ndo and love it as well.  I think it depends on individual<br/>\npreference and what works for your family.<br/>\nI have been reading a lot this past week about the Charlotte<br/>\nMason method and would like to know if there is anyone out<br/>\nthere doing it?  I like the Five in a row study and see an<br/>\nabundance of materials to choose from.  Just starting out in<br/>\nthis adventure, I would be more comfortable with some<br/>\nstructured curriculum but want freedom to go explore and<br/>\ndiscover the world at our pace.  Our state requires yearly<br/>\ntesting so I feel like a curriculum would help us to that<br/>\nend but don&#39;t have much faith in testing in general.  It<br/>\nseems to cause extreme pressure in school children in the<br/>\nmonth of May around here because their results determine<br/>\nteacher pay raises!  If anyone can help me with more<br/>\ninformation, I would really appreciate it.  I haven&#39;t<br/>\nofficially started home schooling yet but it is already<br/>\npart of our lives since I have been doing it to a degree<br/>\nsince they were toddlers.  I want to start this summer or in<br/>\nthe fall.  I have read about decompression time they will<br/>\nneed.  Does anyone have more info on this?  Thank you.<br/>\nDara in South Carolina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7310,"nextTopicId":7316}}
