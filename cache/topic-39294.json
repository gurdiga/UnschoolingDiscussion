I failed to mention in my short intro <br/>\nthat we also do the multi-gen thing....my husband and I are both <br/>\n&#39;semi-retired&#39; (great for early 30&#39;s) - he&#39;s was injured in the military, so <br/>\nwe have a pension from that, and I toy with hobbies that give us &#39;fun money&#39; <br/>\n(presently teaching child care inservices).  Anyway, last summer we decided <br/>\nto put a 1,800 sq. ft. addition onto my parent&#39;s home (basically a huge MIL <br/>\nsuite), and we all live together.  It&#39;s super - we each have our own separate <br/>\nliving quarters, and split all the bills 50/50.  I cook dinner for everyone <br/>\nalmost every night, the girls have both parents home with them, my parents <br/>\nare closer to retirement since we help with the bills, the girls get some <br/>\ngardening experience with my mom (brown thumb here), and get to visit with <br/>\ntheir grandparents on a regular basis.  We all travel a bunch (my mom and dad <br/>\nare presently in GA at a Harley rally, then they leave for three weeks for a <br/>\nride to Newfoundland in early August - we were gone all of April & May) so it <br/>\nworks VERY nicely!  It&#39;s a great plan, Nancy, and we hope that someday we <br/>\nwill share this house with our girls, then they could with each other, their <br/>\nkids, etc. I would really love to see families getting back to this way of <br/>\nlife, people think we&#39;re so odd, but this was a common (and often necessary) <br/>\narrangement until, what, the nineteenth century?  It really gives us all <br/>\nsupport and a terrific feeling of family.  I think we&#39;d all be somewhat <br/>\nbetter off if we had this kind of support network as the norm rather than the <br/>\nexception!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dani (who is stepping off the soapbox, sorry!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151130,"authorName":"danidawn@aol.com","from":"danidawn@...","profile":"danidawn3345","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2164","postDate":"1027171470","msgId":39294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhMy41ODYzMzM5LjJhNmFiZThlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39295,"prevInTime":39293,"nextInTime":39295,"topicId":39294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/20/2002 1:31:02 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

At a Father&#39;s Day gathering at the in-laws&#39;, my husband&#39;s aunt and <br/>\nI got into the old and tired &#39;socialization&#39; discussion.  When I explained <br/>\nthat my girls met with their homeschooled friends at park day at least twice <br/>\na month, the oldest (9) attends the Gifted Student Program (at her own <br/>\ndesire!) one day a week, as well as they meet numerous children from all over <br/>\nthe country when we&#39;re out doing our travel reviews, all she could counter <br/>\nwith was, &quot;Well, those are all kids *just* like her.  How is she going to <br/>\nknow what to do when little Johnny calls her a bad name?  That&#39;s the real <br/>\nworld!&quot;  AAAARRRRGGGGGG!  When I pointed out to her that the parents in our <br/>\nhomeschool groups vary from Fundamentalist Christians to devout Atheists, <br/>\nfrom Yuppie professional types to tattoo artists, from ages 19 to <br/>\n40-something, the point of our different backgrounds was lost on her.  It was <br/>\nstill important for my kids to know what to do when they are called names.  <br/>\nFinally she quit when I said, &quot;Well, you know they&#39;ll do that to each other <br/>\nwhen they hit late adolescence....guess it&#39;s lucky I have two...&quot;  Some <br/>\npeople!  No matter how much they think they want to be educated, they just <br/>\ndon&#39;t listen!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and thanks for your support on the &#39;lurking&#39; mode.  I usually try to lurk <br/>\nawhile to get the feel before I jump in...I&#39;m glad you could all identify <br/>\nwith the &#39;dust&#39; plaque...LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave a brief intro as a homeschooling mom to two daughters (9 and 5 in 13 <br/>\ndays - she&#39;s counting!)...we love the philosophy of unschooling!  What freaks <br/>\nwe are considered to many, people just don&#39;t get it.  My question is <br/>\nthis...how much &#39;guidance&#39; are parents allowed before we&#39;re not really <br/>\nconsidered &#39;unschoolers?&#39;  Izzy (9) chooses all of her topics and such, but I <br/>\ndo have a guideline (although very loose) which keeps her kind of <br/>\nwell-rounded in my opinion.   It&#39;s nothing major, just encourages her to <br/>\nspread her learning between the computer, educational tv, fiction and <br/>\nnon-fiction, and even a little seatwork.  She always gets to choose which <br/>\nshow/book/workbook/cd/etc., but I give her a simple guideline of about 30 <br/>\nminutes of each per day.  Of course, if she watches 4 hours of ER on TLC in <br/>\none day, that &#39;fulfills&#39; her &#39;requirement.&#39;  *I&#39;m VERY flexible on this.  She <br/>\ngets to pick the workbook, etc.  Once we&#39;re &#39;back in the groove&#39; (all her <br/>\nneighbor friends are back to school) she has to be doing something <br/>\n&#39;eduationally productive&#39; between 9 (like she gets up that early...LOL) and <br/>\n2ish...if she can explain to me why playing with LEGOS is educational (which <br/>\nshe can by skill very well...LOL) then fine, if she can tell me that playing <br/>\nwith Barbies &#39;is teaching me to be nurturing and requires cooperation with <br/>\nLilly (little sister)&#39;, then fine.  But I allow no junk TV or <br/>\nGameboy/Nintendo/PlayStation, etc. until after 2...does this sound like some <br/>\nsort of unschooling?  Or am I way off???<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your support and advice (I know no one here would bash <br/>\nmy theories for sharing them, right???? You seem Waaaayyyyyy too nice and <br/>\nsupportive for that!)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dani<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39309,"nextTopicId":39317}}
