They take all the information to a meeting and <br/>\ndiscuss it with a bunch of people who dont know you.  They do not ask for <br/>\ncharachter witnesses or let you speak on your own behalf.  They simply <br/>\ndecide whether the allegations against you are unfounded or not.  If they <br/>\ndecide that they are not unfounded then they decide whether they will take <br/>\nyour children from you or not.  In my case they found that the allegations <br/>\nwere not unfounded but that they would not take my child from me.   The <br/>\nreason I was not informed officially was that  they would NOT take my child <br/>\nfrom me.  They said that they sent a letter but I never recieved any such <br/>\nletter  or I would have fought it.  By the time I found out I had been found<br/>\n<br/>\nguilty the case was closed and could no longer be fought.  When I spoke to <br/>\nthe head of family advocacy at our base she informed me that she voted that <br/>\nthe allegations were not unfounded because she didn&#39;t like my attitude.  <br/>\nWell who would have a good attitude when she has just been accused of <br/>\nstarving her infant child!  I was abused as a child and the biggest insult <br/>\nto me is that ANYONE would ever think I could abuse or neglect my own <br/>\nchildren.   If they had known me or even done a thourough investigation they<br/>\n<br/>\nwould not have found me guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly Atchison<br/>\n<br/>\nPs....Just so you know.

I used to do daycare before I had my<br/>\n&gt;own children but after my first was born I was absolutely clueless as to<br/>\n&gt;what to do for a tiny baby.  We were newly married and depending on <br/>\n&gt;military<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;doctors for help.  Lili was loosing weight after her birth even though I <br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;breastfeeding and she ate all the time.   Well I took her to the doctor a<br/>\n&gt;lot and they never could figure out why she wasn&#39;t gaining weight but they<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t do anything about it either.  Like I said I was<br/>\n&gt;clueless....anyhow...someone overheard me tell a friend about an argument<br/>\n&gt;that John and I had and they reported us for neglect.  (Dont ask how they<br/>\n&gt;got to that conclusion I still dont know)  We were ordered to bring Lili to<br/>\n&gt;the same pediatrician that had seen her before and not done anything.  This<br/>\n&gt;time the doctor was very mean to me and accused me of starving my baby.<br/>\n&gt;She poked and prodded at Lili and gave me a dirty look when SHE made my <br/>\n&gt;baby<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;cry.  She ordered me to feed Lili right in front of her and I told her that<br/>\n&gt;Lili had just eaten and wouldn&#39;t be hungry but she insisted.  So I tried to<br/>\n&gt;feed Lili and she didn&#39;t eat ...DUH.  And that doctor had the nerve to tell<br/>\n&gt;me that Lili had starved so much that she had lost the desire to eat!!!! (I<br/>\n&gt;Still get so mad thinking about this!)   So then I took Lili to Arkansas<br/>\n&gt;Childrens Hospital and they looked at Lili and said that she was very<br/>\n&gt;healthy and alert even though she was so tiny.  They set me up with a<br/>\n&gt;lactation doctor who ran tests on my milk and found that I had NO FAT at <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;in my breastmilk.  So she wrote a letter saying I had done nothing wrong <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;what the problem was.  Well.......The head of family advocacy said she<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t like my attitude so they found us guilty regardless of the doctors<br/>\n&gt;letter.  (SORRY FOR THE LONG STORY)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anyhow, that is now permanently on my record. That I was found guilty of<br/>\n&gt;child neglect so I doubt I could do daycare again.  I tried before Tacy was<br/>\n&gt;born because I had been told that the case was unfounded but it turns out<br/>\n&gt;that they DID find us guilty and never told us.  I only found out when I<br/>\n&gt;tried to be a daycare provider on the base.  And they wouldn&#39;t let me.  Boy<br/>\n&gt;do I know how to make a short story long or what!  Sorry everyone! =)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thank you though for the advice.

I am able to get about $200/week per child, so living frugally, <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would be managable.  Toronto has a fairly high cost of living, but I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;also charge more.  You woud have to phone around other care givers in <br/>\n&gt;your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;neighbourhood.  It does have a real impact on how much outside activity <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt; &gt;can do, as I don&#39;t have a car, and wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable driving <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;people&#39;s kids, but there are always evenings and weekends.  I also have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;heard of people who offer to homeschool other people&#39;s kids for a fee,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;which may be viable for you.  It also means you would get older kids.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Before and after school care is also an option, and not so time <br/>\n&gt;consuming.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I may as well introduce myself now.  My name is christine, and I have two<br/>\n&gt; &gt;little girls, 4 and 1.  I am by profession a Montessori teacher, hence my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;current occupation.  We are unschooling my children, and it I have found <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;amazing to look at Maria Montessori&#39;s writings from that unschooling <br/>\n&gt;angle.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;As I am sure many of you out there have already firgured out, thee isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;alot of difference.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Gotta go make dinner.

I used to do daycare before I had my<br/>\n&gt;own children but after my first was born I was absolutely clueless as to<br/>\n&gt;what to do for a tiny baby.  We were newly married and depending on <br/>\n&gt;military<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;doctors for help.  Lili was loosing weight after her birth even though I <br/>\n&gt;was<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;breastfeeding and she ate all the time.   Well I took her to the doctor a<br/>\n&gt;lot and they never could figure out why she wasn&#39;t gaining weight but they<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t do anything about it either.  Like I said I was<br/>\n&gt;clueless....anyhow...someone overheard me tell a friend about an argument<br/>\n&gt;that John and I had and they reported us for neglect.  (Dont ask how they<br/>\n&gt;got to that conclusion I still dont know)  We were ordered to bring Lili to<br/>\n&gt;the same pediatrician that had seen her before and not done anything.  This<br/>\n&gt;time the doctor was very mean to me and accused me of starving my baby.<br/>\n&gt;She poked and prodded at Lili and gave me a dirty look when SHE made my <br/>\n&gt;baby<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;cry.  She ordered me to feed Lili right in front of her and I told her that<br/>\n&gt;Lili had just eaten and wouldn&#39;t be hungry but she insisted.  So I tried to<br/>\n&gt;feed Lili and she didn&#39;t eat ...DUH.  And that doctor had the nerve to tell<br/>\n&gt;me that Lili had starved so much that she had lost the desire to eat!!!! (I<br/>\n&gt;Still get so mad thinking about this!)   So then I took Lili to Arkansas<br/>\n&gt;Childrens Hospital and they looked at Lili and said that she was very<br/>\n&gt;healthy and alert even though she was so tiny.  They set me up with a<br/>\n&gt;lactation doctor who ran tests on my milk and found that I had NO FAT at <br/>\n&gt;all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;in my breastmilk.  So she wrote a letter saying I had done nothing wrong <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;what the problem was.  Well.......The head of family advocacy said she<br/>\n&gt;didn&#39;t like my attitude so they found us guilty regardless of the doctors<br/>\n&gt;letter.

I used to do daycare before I had my <br/>\nown children but after my first was born I was absolutely clueless as to <br/>\nwhat to do for a tiny baby.  We were newly married and depending on military <br/>\ndoctors for help.  Lili was loosing weight after her birth even though I was <br/>\nbreastfeeding and she ate all the time.   Well I took her to the doctor a <br/>\nlot and they never could figure out why she wasn&#39;t gaining weight but they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do anything about it either.  Like I said I was <br/>\nclueless....anyhow...someone overheard me tell a friend about an argument <br/>\nthat John and I had and they reported us for neglect.  (Dont ask how they <br/>\ngot to that conclusion I still dont know)  We were ordered to bring Lili to <br/>\nthe same pediatrician that had seen her before and not done anything.  This <br/>\ntime the doctor was very mean to me and accused me of starving my baby.   <br/>\nShe poked and prodded at Lili and gave me a dirty look when SHE made my baby <br/>\ncry.  She ordered me to feed Lili right in front of her and I told her that <br/>\nLili had just eaten and wouldn&#39;t be hungry but she insisted.  So I tried to <br/>\nfeed Lili and she didn&#39;t eat ...DUH.  And that doctor had the nerve to tell <br/>\nme that Lili had starved so much that she had lost the desire to eat!!!! (I <br/>\nStill get so mad thinking about this!)   So then I took Lili to Arkansas <br/>\nChildrens Hospital and they looked at Lili and said that she was very <br/>\nhealthy and alert even though she was so tiny.  They set me up with a <br/>\nlactation doctor who ran tests on my milk and found that I had NO FAT at all <br/>\nin my breastmilk.  So she wrote a letter saying I had done nothing wrong and <br/>\nwhat the problem was.  Well.......The head of family advocacy said she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like my attitude so they found us guilty regardless of the doctors <br/>\nletter.

The first is that now i&#39;m my own boss, i don&#39;t need to worry<br/>\n&gt; about keeping up with other&#39;s standards. My house can be messy and no one<br/>\n&gt; cares, etc. The second is being tied down. A lot of parents are<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable havimg there kids driven around. i don&#39;t neccessarily think<br/>\n&gt; this is a bad thing, but we&#39;re on the go from morning to night. And, even if<br/>\n&gt; hte parents don&#39;t mind that there&#39;s still the issue of having to be home by<br/>\n&gt; 4 or 5 pm.
