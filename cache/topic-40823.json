Very<br/>\n| fasinating!  Even went to a house/museum and toured it.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| How about Hoyt Sherman?  Any one ever hear of him?  His mansion<br/>\nis set up<br/>\n| here in Des Moines and has a fasinating story of women in Iowa<br/>\nin the late<br/>\n| 1800s wanting to get away from the prarie talk and more into<br/>\nprestigious<br/>\n| topics from their lives back east, including the art and<br/>\npaintings.  It ends<br/>\n| up now, 100 yrs. later, the women still hold on to his home and<br/>\nhave millions<br/>\n| of dollars of art in it.<br/>\n| It is awesome.
