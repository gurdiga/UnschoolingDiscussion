We are now pushing close to<br/>\n200 of them, including similar dolls like Disney Princesses that are<br/>\ndefinitely a second tier of affection. Sometimes I have moments of &quot;when<br/>\nwill she have enough?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I have become convinced that for Jayn and for the present, Barbie is<br/>\nthe conduit to all knowledge. Presently she is playing with a long elastic<br/>\ncord attached doing pulley and pendulum experiments with her new Sandy (from<br/>\nGrease) doll. Earlier we were happy that the dvd of Grease arrived on the<br/>\nsame day as the doll. We watched that and I relived some high school<br/>\nmemories of seeing it when it came out. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has just learnt, from a Barbie Collector magazine, that there is an<br/>\nannual convention where people make dioramas for their dolls and enter them<br/>\nin competition - something she has begun doing for fun recently. Oh joy, oh<br/>\nrapture, oh when is the next one and how much will it cost us? We&#39;ll have to<br/>\nfind a way to get to it. Gracious - it&#39;s right here in Los Angeles this year<br/>\nin July!

Day before yesterday Linnaea<br/>\n(5) and I were watching clips from the Mythbusters shark week on<br/>\nDicoverychannel.com (England seems to be way behind in the series) and<br/>\nmoved on to watching things from Shark week.  At some point Simon (8)<br/>\nwandered over and snuggled on my lap in the too small chair we have in<br/>\nfront of the computer as we watched videos about sharks in general and<br/>\nGreenland Sharks (with the renoting that Iceland is green and<br/>\nGreenland is icy) and Great Whites and at some point Simon said he<br/>\nwanted to be a &quot;shark handler&quot;.  He wanted to capture and raise sharks<br/>\nand take them around and show them to other people to help raise<br/>\nawareness about sharks.  I suggested that what he might mean is a<br/>\nmarine biologist.  And on the tail of saying that I could feel rising<br/>\nup inside of me this desire to talk about how hard that is to become a<br/>\nmarine biologist.  How many years of study it takes and then how hard<br/>\nit is to find a job.  And as I pushed that voice down, the doubting,<br/>\nthe nagging, the desire to quell his enthusiasm voice, I could hear my<br/>\nown mother telling me, when I was 12 and completely enamored with Jane<br/>\nGoodall and wanting oh so much to become a primatologist, that there<br/>\njust aren&#39;t any jobs in primatology and that it was something outside<br/>\nthe bounds of realism to suppose that I could do such a thing.  And I<br/>\nsaid to myself that he doesn&#39;t have to be a marine biologist, he can<br/>\njust love sharks and we can get a fish tank and we&#39;ve got some cool<br/>\nshark books around the house that I can find and put out in the next<br/>\nfew days or weeks and we&#39;ve been talking about setting up an aquarium<br/>\nand sharks are just fish and, and, and...  All the while this was<br/>\ngoing on in my head Linnaea was asking Simon if his wife would be<br/>\nwilling to stay home with the children while he was a shark handler<br/>\nand Simon said he thought that his job would let him be at home quite<br/>\na bit and he asked me if I thought he could get paid for having a tank<br/>\nfull of sharks at home that he studied and I said I wasn&#39;t sure, and<br/>\nhe said it might be just a hobby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to think that life must be hard.

If we were to list  <br/>\nall the ways there are to learn in order of how effective they are,  <br/>\nthe teacher imposing information through a textbook way would be  <br/>\npretty far down the list. But, as I said, cost per student is  <br/>\nrelatively low.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you&#39;re planning on teaching 30 kids there&#39;s no reason to use  <br/>\ninferior ways of learning!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She loves Jesus but shows extreme boredom when reading bible stories<br/>\n&gt; and it seems like we are doing more text book reading then fun<br/>\n&gt; stuff.

There  <br/>\nare, though, Christian unschooling lists that will let you see how  <br/>\nothers incorporate the Bible into their unschooling lives without  <br/>\nturning it into teaching and lessons. Try the lists at:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd.com/lists/other<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She loves online games but I get tired of her wanting to spend so<br/>\n&gt; much time on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you had the choice between pulling an acre full of weeds with  <br/>\ntweezers and reading a new book by your favorite author how much time  <br/>\nwould you spend reading?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She helps with chores which is a good thing but<br/>\n&gt; it takes alot of reminding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And how long would your husband have to wait for you to get outside  <br/>\nand pull the weeds with the tweezers?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he was totally convinced that it was important for you to pull the  <br/>\nweeds with the tweezers, is there a way he could convince you that it  <br/>\nwas important too so that you would set aside the things you thought  <br/>\nwere important?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also have a 2 year old in the house and I find I am having him sit<br/>\n&gt; in front of the tv most of the  day when I am trying to teach his<br/>\n&gt; sister.  I feel so overwhelmed because that isnt what I want for my<br/>\n&gt; son either.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You won&#39;t need to put him aside when you unschool because learning is  <br/>\npart of living and he&#39;s part of her life too :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will still be times when she&#39;ll appreciate some alone time with  <br/>\nyou to do a project or just read a book uninterrupted, but not  <br/>\nbecause you want her to learn and he&#39;s interfering.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I really need some advise I am struggling so much and if school were<br/>\n&gt; more fun maybe she would pay more attention and actually absorb some<br/>\n&gt; stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You and millions of teachers and parents have said the same thing for  <br/>\ndecades!<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine for the next 12 years your husband would decide what you  <br/>\nshould spend your days learning about, say for this year it&#39;s  <br/>\nMongolian history, Engine rebuilding, Chinese language, and abacus  <br/>\nwork. And, though he&#39;s totally convinced that what he chooses is the  <br/>\nmost important stuff for you, you aren&#39;t interested and can&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand why you should be learning it. All he does is repeat that  <br/>\nit&#39;s important and one day you&#39;ll understand. And that&#39;s what you  <br/>\nhave to look forward to for the next 12 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could he make it more interesting? How could it be less of a  <br/>\nstruggle for him (and for you)? If you come up with the magic formula  <br/>\nfor that you&#39;ll probably make lots of money because schools will be  <br/>\nbeating your door down ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only difference between the above scenario and school is that it  <br/>\nwould be hard to find others who agreed with your husband that the  <br/>\nlist of things is vitally important and it is easy to find people who  <br/>\n*think* what&#39;s learned in school is vitally important.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschoolers aren&#39;t doing anything that looks like school, aren&#39;t  <br/>\nlearning things in any particular order, and they&#39;re turning out  <br/>\nfine. They can go onto college. They can get jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter had no formal math but is sitting in on her father&#39;s  <br/>\ncollege algebra class and doing just fine at 14. Her math has been  <br/>\nvideo games, art programs, grocery stores, &quot;How long until?&quot;  <br/>\nquestions, games, sports statistics and so on. (They did do some fun  <br/>\nalgebra a couple of years ago but Carl says as far as he can tell it  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t stick and it appears as though she&#39;s seeing it for the first  <br/>\ntime.) That&#39;s because she&#39;s been *using* numbers all her life for  <br/>\nreal purposes. She understands how numbers work. Kids in school are  <br/>\nbeing taught abstractions about numbers that they aren&#39;t using and --  <br/>\nafter sitting through confusing math classes -- don&#39;t want to and  <br/>\noften avoid using. Math and lots of other subjects in school are like  <br/>\nmemorizing Spanish words and sentence structure without ever hearing  <br/>\nthe language or using it. It&#39;s just stuff that goes in to be stored  <br/>\nuntil it might be used one day. But, of course, after that process  <br/>\nkids don&#39;t want to and often don&#39;t have any interest in anything that  <br/>\nmight use it. (That&#39;s not a universal occurrence but kids who do well  <br/>\nin school and eagerly move onto college do that *in spite of* what  <br/>\nthey put up with in school.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Her dad comes home everyday and asks her what she learned in<br/>\n&gt; homeschool that day and she never has anything to tell him which<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ask school kids that question and they give the same answer!<br/>\n<br/>\nThough, honestly, if you ask many unschooled kids that question,  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get that answer too ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nA better question, a more authentic question since it&#39;s what you  <br/>\nmight ask another adult, is &quot;What did you do today?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also notice we have to spend 875<br/>\n&gt; hours a year on homeschooling but it seems we only do about 4 hours a<br/>\n&gt; day which would never get us to the 875 mark unless we schooled 12<br/>\n&gt; months out of a year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling is about living life and pursuing interests in a rich  <br/>\nenvironment. Learning happens as a side effect of that. So in  <br/>\nessence, unschooling happens for all hours they&#39;re awake 7 days a  <br/>\nweek, 52 weeks a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *won&#39;t* look like school learning. It *will* look like playing and  <br/>\nbeing interested in things and exploring and living life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you ensure they are learning what they need to for their grade<br/>\n&gt; level each day?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling is living like school doesn&#39;t exist. In which case there  <br/>\nis no grade level to keep up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds scary because when kids *in school* &quot;fall behind&quot; the  <br/>\neffects are often kids falling further and further behind. But that  <br/>\nhappens because school is like a train. If a child pauses on the  <br/>\nplatform to check out the flowers, the train isn&#39;t going to wait. It  <br/>\ntakes off and the child needs to run to catch up with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, it&#39;s more like mom walking along side her child as  <br/>\nhe explores, helping him reach what he&#39;s trying to get that&#39;s out of  <br/>\nhis reach, waiting patiently as he explores what fascinates him  <br/>\n(which can be online games!) Without the train taking off, there&#39;s no  <br/>\nsuch thing as behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s lots to be learned about unschooling here, at the forums at  <br/>\nhttp://www.unschooling.info, at http://sandradodd.com and at my  <br/>\nwebsite down below my name.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nAnswers to common unschooling questions:<br/>\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/<br/>\nBlog of writing prompts for speculative fiction writers:<br/>\nhttp://dragonwritingprompts.blogsome.com/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] New to Unschooling Need some advise","postDate":"1140120617","msgId":112130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwOTU0NjlBLTlCQTktNDU0RC1BQzEzLTVEMTgyM0Q1RUJFRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGR0MmU1bCtsanVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGR0MmU1bCtsanVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":112127,"nextInTopic":112132,"prevInTime":112129,"nextInTime":112131,"topicId":112127,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I wanted<br/>\nto take an unschooling approach but am having a very difficult time<br/>\ngetting through the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is very strongwilled and very artistic.  She is highly<br/>\nhands on type of person.  I find trying to teach each class  becomes<br/>\nextremely boring.  Each class I have a book for and it seems like she<br/>\ndoesnt listen to all the reading and to be honest this isnt what I<br/>\npictured homeschooling to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe loves Jesus but shows extreme boredom when reading bible stories<br/>\nand it seems like we are doing more text book reading then fun<br/>\nstuff.  I wanted homeschooling to be fun to her and me not boring and<br/>\na burden. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe loves online games but I get tired of her wanting to spend so<br/>\nmuch time on them.  She helps with chores which is a good thing but<br/>\nit takes alot of reminding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a 2 year old in the house and I find I am having him sit<br/>\nin front of the tv most of the  day when I am trying to teach his<br/>\nsister.  I feel so overwhelmed because that isnt what I want for my<br/>\nson either. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really need some advise I am struggling so much and if school were<br/>\nmore fun maybe she would pay more attention and actually absorb some<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad comes home everyday and asks her what she learned in<br/>\nhomeschool that day and she never has anything to tell him which<br/>\nmakes my efforts feel useless.  I also notice we have to spend 875<br/>\nhours a year on homeschooling but it seems we only do about 4 hours a<br/>\nday which would never get us to the 875 mark unless we schooled 12<br/>\nmonths out of a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you ensure they are learning what they need to for their grade <br/>\nlevel each day?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease Help<br/>\n<br/>\nFrustrated Mom<br/>\nDeana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112298,"nextTopicId":68502}}
