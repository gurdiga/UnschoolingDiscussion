To be able to catch <br/>\nglimpses of them in the wild or to hear them.  We&#39;ve had visitors before <br/>\nthat really blessed us.  A little racoon was with us for a time.  It was too <br/>\ncute.  And was so great for our family to be able to touch and observe it <br/>\njust being itself.  We&#39;ve been bird-sitters before.  And I would love to be <br/>\nable to get one or two of my own.  I am so thrilled at the uniqueness of all <br/>\nof creation.  Each person has their own unique personality and animals do as <br/>\nwell.  Even little snakes and lizards.  We currently have one pet...a <br/>\nRottweiler.  She&#39;s a year and a half and she&#39;s an indoor pet.  I&#39;ve never <br/>\nseen a dog be so human!  She is our baby and she knows it.  She revels in <br/>\nher place in our family.  She&#39;s a real joy to us.  She&#39;s the sweetest, <br/>\npuppy-head dog.  The kids and I have talked about other pets we&#39;d like to <br/>\nhave; but we feel like our Rotty is enough for now.  :)<br/>\n~Marcy~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]smelly turtle!<br/>\n&gt;Date: Mon, 15 May 2000 22:35:50 -0700<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We have a red-tail hawk that lives in the gully next to us and sits on the<br/>\n&gt;tippy top of the fir tree next door.
