My personal definition of demand feeding is feeding<br/>\nwhenever the baby cries no matter how much time has gone by since the last<br/>\nfeeding.  Even if it has only been an hour.  The Ezzo&#39;s are being slammed for<br/>\nParent-controlled feeding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will give you the definition of Parent Controlled feeding straight from their<br/>\nbook:<br/>\n    &quot;It is unfortunate, but there are still some whose only understanding of an<br/>\ninfant schedule comes from old wives&#39; tales and bad advice.  They speak of rigid<br/>\nfeeding periods with babies crying needlessly, waiting to be fed - and mothers<br/>\nwho are forced to harden their hearts to their baby&#39;s cry.  Although that may be<br/>\nan accurate reflection of the J.B. Watson era, it is a distorted picture of what<br/>\nan infant schedule should be and what Parent-Controlled Feeding is.<br/>\n    The Parent-Controlled Feeding plan has to do with more than just feeding.  It<br/>\nis a 24 hour strategy designed to meet not only the needs of your baby, but those<br/>\nof the entire family as well.  It&#39;s made up of 3 basic activities that are<br/>\nrepeated in a rythmical cycle throughout the day: feeding, wake time, and nap<br/>\ntime.  Those cycles are both routine and predictable&quot;  (Italics theirs) And then<br/>\nthey go in to say why routine and predictability are important to an infant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another method of feeding that I beleive the Ezzo&#39;s method is being<br/>\nmixed up with.  The Clock Feeding or hyper-schedule.  It is a synthetic response<br/>\nsince the mothering process is subject to the clock as the final authority.  The<br/>\nclock in a sense assumes all responsibility of right and wrong, removing the need<br/>\nfor emotions.  The Ezzo&#39;s do not teach this nor do they believe it is right!<br/>\n<br/>\nI feed my baby taking into consideration both time and true need.  I know that<br/>\nbabies go through growth spurts and that sometimes their motabolism slows down,<br/>\nand I also consider that.  When my daughter was first born I was feeding her<br/>\nwhenever she cried.  When I read about the PCF I tried it and it worked for me.<br/>\nFeeding, waketime and naptime, in that order every 3-4 hours really freed me up<br/>\nand seemed to take the stress out of it for me.  I had her on a schedule and she<br/>\nalso seemed a lot less fussy than before.  Like I said, it worked for me.<br/>\nEveryone has their own way of doing things and I do not have any sort of<br/>\nauthority nor do I give myself heirs (sp?) to say anything about the way anyone<br/>\nelse does things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and second:  &lt;&lt;But I always compare it to what Scripture has to say.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; since Scripture can be so easily used out of context to suit the defender, on<br/>\n&gt; whose interpretation do you rest your trust?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Honestly I rest my trust on God.  I pray about it and go with what he tells me.<br/>\nI am certainly human and make plenty of mistakes, so I can truly say that I try<br/>\nmy best and rely on God to give me the wisdom I need.  He says He gives it freely<br/>\nto all who ask, so I ask on a regular basis!!! :-) I definately need it with 4<br/>\nkids!  I am not saying that because you demand feed that you aren&#39;t following<br/>\nwhat God has said.  God says different things to different people.  TV might be a<br/>\nsin for one person because they put it before God and not for another because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t. As long as you&#39;re living your best to please and follow Jesus, that&#39;s<br/>\nall that matters.  If you or I are doing anything wrong, as Christians He will<br/>\nshow it to us eventually.  Isn&#39;t that good to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for asking and I am really sorry that I ever brought this up.  I know<br/>\nthis is a mailing list about unschooling not debates on which way is right to<br/>\nbreastfeed and raise your kids.  Please believe me that I never meant for any of<br/>\nthis to happen!  I don&#39;t subscribe to being the final authority on anything so<br/>\nplease don&#39;t take anything I said as being condemning or condesending!<br/>\nGod Bless!!! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving for Him,<br/>\nFaith</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3591,"nextTopicId":3603}}
