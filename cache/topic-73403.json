I\r<br/>\noffered to help and got it layed flat and neat, but it took several tries<br/>\nand\r<br/>\nsome tears and screaming before we finally got it just right.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAt that point, I&#39;m just glad he isn&#39;t loudly crying anymore. I can&#39;t think<br/>\nof\r<br/>\nwhy he could possibly want this blanket layed out JUST RIGHT but he seems\r<br/>\nhappy now.\r<br/>\nYou have to visualize this quilt. It&#39;s got several squares of a little boy\r<br/>\nwith a fishing pole and four outside squares with different scenes.\r<br/>\nJalen excitedly points to the pictures and does his &quot;tttttttthhhhhhhhhhhh&quot;\r<br/>\nsound.\r<br/>\nThen I see him squatting in front of the quilt, just staring and pointing<br/>\nand\r<br/>\nbeing very quiet. I watch for a long time...it&#39;s really quite amazing.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFinally, he shows me some items in one of the pictures. A football, a\r<br/>\nbaseball and an apple. Familiar things he is happy to see there. We sit and<br/>\npoint to\r<br/>\ndifferent items, each one gets a &quot;ttttthhhhhhhhhh&quot; of course. :)\r<br/>\nI go and get a real apple. He sees it and gets REALLY excited. We cut it up\r<br/>\nand he grabs a chunk and goes back to his squatting/picture watching again.\r<br/>\nThis goes on for some time, this apple grabbing and squatting back down in<br/>\nfront\r<br/>\nof the quilt. It was really cool.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nEarlier today, a newer friend called. She said she had dreamed about Jalen\r<br/>\nand it had to do with his mind and his intellect. Told me I really, really\r<br/>\nneeded to go buy &quot;The Indigo Child&quot; (which I&#39;d heard of from some of you)<br/>\nbecause\r<br/>\nshe feels very strongly he is an Indigo Child.\r<br/>\nThe day she first came to our group, this child of mine had the connections\r<br/>\nbetween her and her belongings so quickly, that when a piece fell off of her\r<br/>\ncell phone, he brought it to her immedietly. (she was on the other side of<br/>\nthe\r<br/>\nroom at the time, I hadn&#39;t even noticed she HAD a cell phone with her and<br/>\nshe&#39;d\r<br/>\nbeen there all of 15 minutes).....\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAnyway, I just thought it was really cool to see the 2.5 y.o. connections\r<br/>\nbeing made tonight.

She fell off the playroom table again<br/>\nfor like the 5th time. I was out with Sierra and she had been very busy even<br/>\nafter I came home. Building things with Joseph and then Sierra too. Big<br/>\nthings with foam blocks that the cat would go in. Not sure if that&#39;s what it<br/>\nwas for but she liked that Schnell (Chanel) liked it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLat night she came and laid in my arms and hugged me and said, &quot;what&#39;s that&quot;<br/>\nas she pointed to my chest and then gave my nose a tap when I looked down.<br/>\nThen she said, &quot;Mommy, you&#39;re my friend.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight as I tucked her in bed, she told me I was her favorite mommy. Sierra<br/>\nthought that was real funny.
