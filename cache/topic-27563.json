Or something to let her know that this <br/>\nwent on and you are available to help in some small way.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, this is not that uncommon a situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy recent encounter:  A young boy (I though 6 or 7 yo, turned out he was 8 <br/>\n(but he had to think about it!)) came to the door selling that school <br/>\nfundraiser stuff (notice my ladylike restraint).  Alone!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was one of the half-days of ps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our first encounter I asked where his Mom or Dad were -- &quot;Oh, Dad&#39;s at <br/>\nwork until 6:00 and Mom&#39;s at work too.&quot;  OK -- half day of school.  He&#39;s <br/>\nalone until 6:00, from 1:00 on.  This was about 1:30 -- he could have been <br/>\nmissing until 6:00 before anyone even knew!<br/>\n<br/>\nAck.  I did the wrong thing and told him to come back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have just had him wait out on the front deck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called the school.  No, he was not supposed to be selling door to door.  <br/>\nBut, no, it was not the school&#39;s problem and there wasn&#39;t anything they could <br/>\ndo about it.  &quot;Well, the first words out of his mouth are that he&#39;s selling <br/>\nthis stuff for XYZ School.&quot;  No matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, he came back and I had him sit down out on the front deck and gave him a <br/>\ngood talking-to.  And he &quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot;-ed me and seemed to be heading in the <br/>\ndirection of his house.  From what I gathered about 5-6 blocks away.  He also <br/>\nclaimed that nobody had ever told him that he shouldn&#39;t be going up to <br/>\nstrangers&#39; homes or that he shouldn&#39;t be out by himself.  He was 8 -- and <br/>\nlittle -- I could have picked him up under one arm!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope he made it home.  Should I have taken him home?  Who knows what I could <br/>\nhave been in trouble for in that case.  But it seemed wrong to send him off <br/>\nalone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the school is at fault for pumping these little kids up about the <br/>\ntrinkets they can win for selling enough of this junk.  And the parents are <br/>\nat fault too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as the school&#39;s assistant prin told me, this is not an uncommon thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nVent over!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Samantha Stopple","from":"Samantha Stopple &lt;sammimag@...&gt;","profile":"sammimag","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Vvf0rUqDU1ink1MJxDP1BaoxtdRDHFNJhz6N3lRBgSw_gFddt_rDFXRqFk6Z3o5R_KlPlCbeLJZ_UMYvPdGg1X2gV-ONvKc6or7MUA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Moral dillema","postDate":"1005458736","msgId":27564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTExMDYwNTM2Ljg3NjYxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjIwMDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWMxNmE0ZSQzMWQzMjhjMCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4="},"prevInTopic":27563,"nextInTopic":27569,"prevInTime":27563,"nextInTime":27565,"topicId":27563,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
