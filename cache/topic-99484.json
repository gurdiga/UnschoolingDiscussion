So far we <br/>\nremain outside of the radar of the Local Education Authority (LEA) <br/>\nand have had no legal issues.  There is a movement toward all <br/>\nchildren being under governmental surveillance--a child was <br/>\nneglected/abused and died under government surveillance so they want <br/>\nto make sure that all children can suffer greater levels of <br/>\ngovernment intervention, so our relative anonymity may not last. <br/>\nWhere we live (in the Northeast of England) there is very little in <br/>\nthe way of unschooling.  I would imagine just by sheer population <br/>\ndensity there would be more unschoolers about in London.  The <br/>\nnational homeschooling charity can be found at <br/>\nwww.educationotherwise.co.uk. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know very little about homeschooling in the Netherlands or in <br/>\nSingapore.  I found this <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/Singapore.htm\">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/Singapore.htm</a> about <br/>\nSingapore, so as an ex-pat it looks like you&#39;d not fall under any <br/>\nconsideration by the government.  My understand is that it is very <br/>\ndifficult to homeschool in the Netherlands and this site <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nvvto.nl/page4.html\">http://www.nvvto.nl/page4.html</a> seems to verify that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your move.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jpnunnally&quot; <br/>\n&lt;jean@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I have not ever posted here before, but feel this group may be able <br/>\n&gt; to help with this question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are considering a job assignment for my dh in possibly London, <br/>\n&gt; The Hague or Singapore.
