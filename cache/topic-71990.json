One thing I remember (and, relating<br/>\nback to unschooling, this gives me a way to relate to how my kids learn<br/>\nthings like language) is that I had this word in my life that I never could<br/>\nfigure out. It was &quot;Bureau&quot;. My dad drove a &quot;Bureau car&quot;, my mom hung out<br/>\nwith &quot;Bureau wives&quot;, they went to &quot;Bureau functions&quot; and parties. It was<br/>\nlike I could never get a handle on what the word meant, because it seemed to<br/>\napply to everything. I think I was finally 13 or so when I had a &quot;duh&quot;<br/>\nmoment and understood that &quot;Bureau&quot; was FBI.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne cool thing about my dad is that he gave up this great career in the FBI<br/>\nto move back to Oregon because back then the Bureau moved agents around<br/>\nevery two years and it was very destabilizing for the kids. So he quit when<br/>\nI was 7. It was nice, I got to live next to both sets of grandparents and<br/>\ngrow up in a small town/rural environment where I had a ton of freedom -<br/>\nriding bikes all over the place as kids, etc. That&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve always<br/>\nreally respected about him, that he put our family first. He was always the<br/>\ntype to come home right at 5:00 too and play with us kids too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does have some great stories. He once helped rescue the actor who played<br/>\nHop Sing on Bonanza from an airplane hijacking. Hey, I guess that makes me 3<br/>\ndegrees from Michael Landon and the others on that show.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt; I used to be in a punk rock band &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What did you play?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guitar. Not terribly well, mind you, but I&#39;m a great songwriter (at least in<br/>\nmy own mind :-). Also, it was a great way to work out all that teen angst<br/>\nover school and all. I have lots of songs and writings about how much school<br/>\nfelt like a prison. Come to think of it, back to the 6 degrees thread, the<br/>\nsinger in my band was an actor in the movie &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (one of the<br/>\nfriends of the older brother of the main character), so that makes me two<br/>\ndegrees from Rob Reiner, one of my favorite directors.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118359131,"authorName":"Laramike12@aol.com","from":"Laramike12@...","profile":"laralarahun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: Connections","postDate":"1054671478","msgId":71990,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYS4yYjRkN2JlZi4yYzBlNWM3NkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72023,"prevInTime":71989,"nextInTime":71991,"topicId":71990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/3/03 7:02:07 PM, diamondair@email.msn.com writes:  Very Cool!!
