We are now the proud owners of a baby named Pema, named for one of my favorite writers, a Buddhist nun called Pema Chodron.  My Pema is just lovely, sweet and affectionate, and a terrific addition to the family zoo.  Kayla (4) just adores her, although she gets her small furry creatures confused and calls Pema a Beanie pig!  I am still experiencing the hormonal surge which resulted in my bringing Pema home to nurture, so I am considering other pets.  I&#39;d love to have a goat, although my husband rolled his eyes, shook his head and walked away from me when I mentioned it the other day.

Now she is into astronomy (age 12).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend getting females over males (though it is sometimes hard to<br/>\ntell them apart when they are young). Guinea pigs are social critters who<br/>\nare happier if they have a friend or two to snuggle up with when they sleep.<br/>\nMales tend to fight with each other unless they are brothers from the same<br/>\nlitter who have always lived together. Females are pretty mellow and will<br/>\nget along with just about any other guinea pig, even if the second pig is<br/>\nintroduced much later.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur male seemed to be messier than the females. He was always strutting<br/>\naround marking his territory, flinging the bedding out of his cage and<br/>\nknocking over his food dish. This went on even when we kept him in a<br/>\ndifferent cage well apart from the females. He would still try to impress<br/>\nthem from across the room!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have great memories of our piggies. No regrets. The only down side I can<br/>\nthink of is that you also have cats. We once had two cats who thought our<br/>\npiggies were the most delicious playthings in the world. Our cats liked to<br/>\nlounge on the tops of the pig cages with their forelegs dangling down<br/>\nthrough the bars. They&#39;d often make a quick grab for the pigs whenever they<br/>\ncame out of their hiding places. This resulted in some ugly looking<br/>\nscratches on the piggies backs. (We treated the wounds with neosporin.) The<br/>\ncats also liked to knock the cages off of the table and/or pull the cage<br/>\ndoors open, so we had to fasten the cages to the wall and lock the doors<br/>\nshut with zip-ties. All those security measures were hard to work around at<br/>\nfeeding/cleaning times.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m sure that your 4 cats are more civilized than mine were. If they<br/>\nhave not yet eaten the rats, frogs, rabbit, bird, fish (and dogs--lol) that<br/>\nyou already have, welcoming guinea pigs into the group should be easy as<br/>\npie. Enjoy! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Tyler--mom to three kids (12, 9, 6) but no pets at the moment.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":104195621,"authorName":"Kelly","from":"&quot;Kelly&quot; &lt;kstock@...&gt;","profile":"farmgirlnj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Pet advice","postDate":"1079924845","msgId":92155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMzbGw5ZCs3bGk3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTMtREFWMjRUdUhabmNKZkswMDAwMDlhNkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":92111,"nextInTopic":92159,"prevInTime":92154,"nextInTime":92156,"topicId":92094,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I have 3 piggies and they are very sweet and friendly.
