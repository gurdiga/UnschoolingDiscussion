I would <br/>\nlike to understand fully. I&#39;m thinking that maybe you wanted her to <br/>\nunderstand that a report is written when someone wants one for a real <br/>\nreason. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turned out, I laminated it and used it in a workshop on writing.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-A lot of parents, even unschoolers, would be tempted to try to, <br/>\nin a subtle way, encourage writing, or at least not discourage. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink you were really trying to discourage, but instead had some clear <br/>\ngood intention.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were joking around and I was telling them about school book reports, and <br/>\nshe said she wanted to write one.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a scanner working, but I&#39;ll try to put it up where people can <br/>\nsee it someday.   It&#39;s very decorated and decorative.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-    I do know that with my son who has been to PS that I have to really <br/>\nbe careful not to react more to schoolish type interests, because he <br/>\npicks up on it and has an aversion to doing these things if they are <br/>\nconsidered schoolish and therefore more desirable. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty was little I used to tease him if he would read something aloud <br/>\n(the name of a business, or a word off a billboard) and say &quot;STOP!  If I wanted <br/>\nyou to read, I would have sent you to school.&quot;  He thought it was hilarious <br/>\nthat he was &quot;rebelling&quot; by learning to read against my will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was along the lines of that when I told Holly I didn&#39;t want a report.  It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t the reverse psychology of &quot;no, no, I really don&#39;t want one,&quot; though.  I <br/>\nreally did NOT want one!!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last few years I taught, book reports took the form of private <br/>\ndiscussions, with the  book in hand and the kid could look things up to read me good <br/>\nparts or find characters&#39; names if they needed to.   I didn&#39;t care if they said <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t like the book, or that they had stopped &quot;here&quot; and showed me how <br/>\nfar they had gotten before they decided to bail.  The point was to discuss <br/>\nsomething they had read (rather than to have finished and summarized a book).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do that sort of thing with my kids all the time, so the traditional written <br/>\nbook report to prove the book had been read, or to practice writing reports <br/>\n(I shudder at that justification) has no place in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-But he didn&#39;t mention the <br/>\nwriting so I didn&#39;t. I peeked later without him knowing. I was very <br/>\ncurious about the content and somewhat about the spelling. He was <br/>\nwriting about Six Flags! It was cute.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed someone criticized your looking.  If he wanted it secret he <br/>\ncould&#39;ve hidden it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids and husband read over my shoulder lots of times.  If I have something <br/>\nsecret to write (which is rare) I do it in secret.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and Kirby share my computer sometimes.  Sometimes they leave files <br/>\nopen.  Sometimes I&#39;ve had to look at an &quot;untitled&quot; or oddly named file on the <br/>\ndesktop to see where to put it.  I see their writing there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I read into the record at that workshop (or at least passed <br/>\naround for people to see) was some online role playing stuff of Kirby&#39;s.  It <br/>\nwas really good.  Its goodness wasn&#39;t in technicalities, but in the aliveness <br/>\nof the language, in the &quot;voice&quot; of the character, and in the tenderness of the <br/>\ntreatment of the other character (he was being the dad to a young daughter, <br/>\nand this wasn&#39;t a &quot;public&quot; scene, but was in a chatroom, just the two of <br/>\nthem---part of &quot;storyline,&quot; but not in the way of in-person D&D games in front of <br/>\nthe whole group).<br/>\n<br/>\nI got Kirby&#39;s permission to use that, though, before I used it.  I didn&#39;t get <br/>\nhis permission to read it before I read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that he has his own computer, I wouldn&#39;t look at anything on there.  <br/>\nWhat&#39;s on my physical or electronic desktop for me to have to move or clean up, <br/>\nthough, seems fair game.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids know my passwords.  They can look at stuff on my computer.  Things I <br/>\nwant to keep close (Christmas notes and such) are named things they wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nthink to look in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found one of Marty&#39;s role playing scenes the other day.  It was really <br/>\nsweet too.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s never cause in school to &quot;write something sweet.&quot;   All the sweet <br/>\nstuff is love notes and they&#39;re confiscated and the kid&#39;s in trouble for writing <br/>\nand passing them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sorry this is long.

It was great. I <br/>\nlearned a lot. You were talking about reports and writing for a real <br/>\npurpose (like a review for Amazon). Then you told a story about Holly <br/>\nhearing you and Marty, I think, talking about reports on books or <br/>\nmovies. And she enthusiastically said she wanted to write a report. And <br/>\nyou said to her, &quot;I don&#39;t want a report&quot;.  Now I trust that you had a <br/>\ngood reason but can you explain why you responded like this? I would <br/>\nlike to understand fully. I&#39;m thinking that maybe you wanted her to <br/>\nunderstand that a report is written when someone wants one for a real <br/>\nreason. A lot of parents, even unschoolers, would be tempted to try to, <br/>\nin a subtle way, encourage writing, or at least not discourage. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink you were really trying to discourage, but instead had some clear <br/>\ngood intention.<br/>\n    I do know that with my son who has been to PS that I have to really <br/>\nbe careful not to react more to schoolish type interests, because he <br/>\npicks up on it and has an aversion to doing these things if they are <br/>\nconsidered schoolish and therefore more desirable. Recently, after I <br/>\nhad listened to yours and Richards tape, we went to Six Flags which my <br/>\nson had been hankering after for some time. He was so excited and <br/>\nafterwards talked a lot about it. (Now this is a kid who doesn&#39;t do a <br/>\nwhole lot of reading and never liked to write. He&#39;s 11. Recently I have <br/>\nbeen making it known that invented spelling is totally fine and not to <br/>\nhesitate to write because of not knowing how to spell. That has helped <br/>\na lot.)<br/>\n      So after the Six Flags day, he announced one day that he had found <br/>\nhimself a journal downstairs that he could write in. I was totally <br/>\nsurprised because he always knew they were there and available. AND, <br/>\nbecause he had never expressed any interest in writing. So I just said <br/>\nsomewhat casually, &quot;great&quot;. Then after breakfast, he said, &quot;I&#39;m gonna <br/>\ngo write in my journal&quot;. I could tell by the way he said it that he had <br/>\nsomething to write about. I again responded casually. So he wrote in <br/>\nhis journal for a few days in a row in the same way they had done in <br/>\nschool, just writing about what they did the previous day etc.  I <br/>\nalmost slipped and asked him about it later and my initial reaction was <br/>\nto praise him or kind of acknowledge that he had a breakthrough. But I <br/>\ncaught myself and didn&#39;t say anything just like I don&#39;t praise him for <br/>\nvideo gaming stuff. If he&#39;s excited about reaching a new level tho, I <br/>\nwill share in his excitement with him. But he didn&#39;t mention the <br/>\nwriting so I didn&#39;t. I peeked later without him knowing. I was very <br/>\ncurious about the content and somewhat about the spelling. He was <br/>\nwriting about Six Flags! It was cute. Not a lot of writing, maybe half <br/>\na page which I guess is a lot considering it came from his own <br/>\nmotivation. YEA!  Spelling was as I expected. This was very encouraging <br/>\nto me and interesting that his excitement about Six Flags inspired <br/>\nwriting. One interesting note is that all the entries were as tho he <br/>\nwere writing TO someone, like at the end he wrote something like, &quot; <br/>\nI&#39;ll get back to you later&quot;.  So he wrote for maybe 6 days and thats <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n   Sorry this is long. Thanks for reading! And thanks for the talk by <br/>\nyou and Richard.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85632,"nextTopicId":85590}}
