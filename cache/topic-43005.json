Unfortunately, it seems our schools are better at <br/>\nturning kids off to learning than they are at turning them on to it. <br/>\nThe problem, as the saying goes, might be too many cooks spoiling the <br/>\nsoup. Children don&#39;t get the soup until the federal and state <br/>\npoliticians, county and local politicians, test writers, textbook <br/>\npublishers, teachers unions, school boards, taxpayers, <br/>\nsuperintendents, principals, and teachers all add their own brands of <br/>\nseasoning. When they&#39;re all done, every conceivable kind of learner <br/>\n-- regardless of taste or appetite -- is served the same unpalatable, <br/>\nwatered-down mix that has only a vague resemblance to the healthy, <br/>\nnatural thing -- real education.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are natural learning machines. Turn them on, then get the <br/>\nheck outta their way! Instead of mental gruel, feed them whole food <br/>\nfor the mind -- real books, and knowledge borne of experience in the <br/>\ngreater world where they will live and work and play -- today, not <br/>\ntomorrow. Only in freedom to taste the variety of ways to learn that <br/>\nthe world has to offer can a child truly be turned on...<br/>\n<br/>\n... Once you&#39;ve got those lean, mean learning machines well fed and <br/>\nrunning, it&#39;s time to tune in like only a parent can do. You&#39;re in a <br/>\nperfect position to observe, study, and participate. Tune in to what <br/>\nturns your child on. It might be physics. It might be comic books. No <br/>\nmatter, learning is available from both -- we&#39;re in the real world <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith clues about what turns your child on, seek out available <br/>\nresources that build on the excitement and keep the momentum going. <br/>\nFind information in books and on the Internet, yes, but also check <br/>\nout videos, television programs, museums, organizations, and, most <br/>\nimportantly, people within the community who share the same passion. <br/>\nTake an active interest so you can be the very best guide (not <br/>\nteacher, guide) that money can&#39;t buy. Open your own mind to learning <br/>\nfor the pure joy of it and you&#39;ll find, along with your child, that <br/>\nthe world is full of interesting things to know. Build up your own <br/>\nappetite for knowledge, and sit down to partake in that healthy, <br/>\nnatural soup right alongside your offspring.<br/>\n~~ Linda Dobson in the Sept/Oct issue of Home Education Magazine ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the rest of this delicious column, as well as a couple <br/>\nof articles and columns from the September/October issue at the <br/>\naddress above, but you&#39;ll have to get the magazine--the one you hold <br/>\nin your hands--to read them all!

These games are like <br/>\ntaking tests, only fun. Test your knowledge on all kinds of topics at <br/>\nthe following websites. Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer 6 trivia questions on a variety of topics. Questions change <br/>\nperiodically. The Cyber Camp at World Book&#39;s site offers some <br/>\ninteresting projects as well.

Now, I don&#39;t want to take Ann Lander&#39;s place, but <br/>\nI will take those thorny questions and problems you struggle with and <br/>\ntry to give you some options or information that might help you. <br/>\nAlthough I don&#39;t answer the questions in this newsletter, I do answer <br/>\nthem in every issue of HEM, the original print version where <br/>\nhomeschoolers have found support for over 20 years. A couple of them <br/>\nare online (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most you have to <br/>\nread in the magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>\nthink your question is too stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has <br/>\nyour particular problem (probably not true). So, don&#39;t be shy; don&#39;t <br/>\nprocrastinate; send me your questions. I even have a special email <br/>\naddress: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t promise I <br/>\ncan answer every question in the magazine (especially if you don&#39;t <br/>\nsend one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a <br/>\ncolumn or not. Don&#39;t wait!

I had struggled with deciding to <br/>\nsupport my dd (daughter) in going back to school this year. She&#39;s <br/>\nbeen begging to go for about a year. (She is 10.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, here are some of the things she described after 1 week at school:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe teacher was BORING.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe class work was BORING. &quot;All we do is sit at desks all day and <br/>\nread a book or do paperwork.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe even asked if it would be that boring next week, and her friends <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Yes, but we just have to deal with it.&quot; That&#39;s the first <br/>\nhonest thing they&#39;ve told her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecess was BORING.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids were &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;mean and bossy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe food sucked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cafeteria aides chased the kids out before their lunch period was <br/>\nover. (Like after they&#39;d only been eating for 5 or 10 minutes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bathroom privileges, while flexible this week, were going to <br/>\nchange: next week they can only go when they get to school and at <br/>\nlunch. (I pity the girls who get their period for the first time!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe librarian wouldn&#39;t explain how to play a particular game (the <br/>\nkids who&#39;ve been there all these years already knew how to <br/>\nplay)...and so she was the only one who didn&#39;t get a prize. This <br/>\nlibrarian also knew she was homeschooled and told me she thinks there <br/>\nis a &quot;right&quot; way to homeschool...BLECH.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo her credit, my wonderful daughter DID stand up to the cafeteria <br/>\naids and told them that she had until 1pm to finish eating, to which <br/>\nthey replied that she &quot;had a point.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad she came back home. ~~ Koolaidmom, unschooling.com <br/>\nmessage board (edited for publication) ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling.com offers a free monthly newsletter, message boards, an <br/>\nemail list and more just for unschoolers.

It&#39;s not really <br/>\nas exciting as seeing the lights light up, but it&#39;s still fun to play <br/>\nwith. Why not try some math games too?

But for each of <br/>\nthose encouraging articles, there were also the ones we dreaded, <br/>\nthose that gave misinformation, or painted a very skewed picture of <br/>\nwho homeschoolers are and what it is that we do all day...&quot; ~~ Laura <br/>\nDerrick ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura mentions several different articles that are beginning to show <br/>\na shift in reporters&#39; attitudes toward homeschooling. She writes, &quot;A <br/>\nyear ago we had only glimpses of these kinds of media pieces. Now it <br/>\nreally seems as if the tide might finally be turning toward a much <br/>\nmore interesting coverage of homeschooling. A lot of credit should go <br/>\nto the many homeschoolers who have opened up their lives, and <br/>\nsometimes even their homes, to journalists, so that the world might <br/>\nsee beyond the statistics and the contests to the heart and soul of <br/>\nhomeschooling.&quot; Read the entire article at the NHEN website: <br/>\nhttp://www.nhen.org/nhen/pov/editors/default.asp?id=397<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\n<br/>\nTIME TO PRACTICE!<br/>\n<br/>\nMany kids start music lessons in the fall.
