In fact, for more than 80% of <br/>\nhomeschoolers, their mental image of homeschooling is probably the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvertisement<br/>\n&quot;If homeschooling your kids is a dream that&#39;s found its way to the back <br/>\nburner because of the cost involved, you&#39;re in for a wonderful surprise!&quot;<br/>\n-Mary Hunt (Cheapskate Monthly)<br/>\n<br/>\nGet more info.<br/>\nSave at the Bookmobile ONLINE!<br/>\nUse the QuickGuide and find books quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me offer a slightly different view, and define it this way: <br/>\n&quot;Homeschooling is parents deciding and directing the education of their <br/>\nchildren&quot;. Deciding and directing the education, not doing all the <br/>\neducating.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our daughter, Stephanie, was about 12 years old, she had been <br/>\nhomeschooled for 5 years. She came to us an announced that she wanted to <br/>\ntake a foreign language this year. We assumed she met French or Spanish, but <br/>\nshe revealed she wanted to learn Hebrew ! Hebrew ! What do we know about <br/>\nHebrew ? Nothing. But, we didn&#39;t have to learn Hebrew for her to learn <br/>\nHebrew. By the end of that week, we had enrolled her in the bar mitzvah <br/>\ncourse at the local synagogue, and she took Hebrew there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe assumption for most people is that they have to know it to teach it to <br/>\ntheir children. Not quite true, since the parent doesn&#39;t have to be the one <br/>\nto teach it. Consider this -- suppose my child wanted to take violin <br/>\nlessons, and I don&#39;t know anything about violin. Does she have to wait for <br/>\nme to become proficient in violin before she takes lessons ? Of course not. <br/>\nWe simply find a suitable instructor and she takes violin lessons. Same with <br/>\nart. Same with foreign language, even Hebrew. Well, what about Math, <br/>\nEnglish, Science, or History ? Why not ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my homeschooling son was ready to take Algebra, he took it at the local <br/>\ncommunity college. One course as a community student, he didn&#39;t have to <br/>\n&quot;apply&quot; for college admission. He simply registered and took the course. See <br/>\nthe point ?<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often parents dismiss homeschooling because they have a limited image of <br/>\nwhat homeschooling is. They have the mistaken idea that they are not <br/>\nqualified. &quot;How could I ever teach Chemistry or Physics?&quot; they ask. And they <br/>\nmake their decision about homeschooling based on their limitations. The <br/>\nreality is that when you use the resources available in the community, there <br/>\nare very few limitations. The parent doesn&#39;t need to know it -- the parent <br/>\nneeds to know how to find it. That&#39;s homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2900,"nextTopicId":2912}}
