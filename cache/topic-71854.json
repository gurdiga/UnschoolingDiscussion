I never downplay<br/>\nwhat she feels or does because of her age.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a good note, her and her boyfriend are here tonight. I think she&#39;s trying<br/>\nto break me in gently!!! LOL!!!<br/>\nWe finally got her title to her car today and Joe took her out driving on<br/>\nthe interstate and also tonight in &quot;her&quot; car. She&#39;s getting real excited and<br/>\nI am so happy for her. She&#39;s been waiting so patiently for this to happen.<br/>\nWe&#39;re hoping the car will be done within the next month.
