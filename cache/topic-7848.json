This was just a little paper card and did not <br/>\nhave  a picture on it.  It did have my school address on it, though, and I <br/>\ndid have to show it when I made a purchase, as the store kept a record of <br/>\nwhich school had made use of the card.<br/>\n  Recently I got a free discontinued wallpaper book.  The sales lady told me <br/>\nthey were free to &quot;teachers&quot;.  I told  her that I &quot;teach&quot; my own kids, and  <br/>\nshe did not charge me- (although it would have only been a dollar).  Anyway, <br/>\nthere was a question about making a card--I would caution you about making <br/>\none that looked too&quot;professional&quot;, or if you made one, maybe you could make <br/>\nit clear that it is a home educator&#39;s card, just so you could not be accused <br/>\nof trying to be an &quot;imposter&quot;.  Possibly your support group could design a <br/>\ncard and check with some local stores to see if they would set up an <br/>\nagreement to honor these discount cards. If you are not in a support group, <br/>\nmaybe you could talk to some store managers and see if they would be willing <br/>\nto work with you personally--they might even have a form that you could fill <br/>\nout and show each time you shopped there.  Well, good luck to you both!         <br/>\n                                                                    Karen in <br/>\nInd</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7826,"nextTopicId":7838}}
