We&#39;ve stayed in one <br/>\nanothers&#39; homes, we&#39;ve observed each other and been observed BY others with our <br/>\nchildren---so we *know* it&#39;s not &quot;all talk and no walk.&quot; Many of us talk <br/>\noff-line to each other about our own lives. I&#39;d classify it as comraderie, NOT a <br/>\nclique. We have many of the same interests ---and the overwhelming HUGE <br/>\ninterest is in UNschooling: the purpose of these lists and boards and conferences. So <br/>\nwe &quot;CLICK&quot; on the same topic. We understand it. We LIVE it completely and <br/>\npurely and radically and from deep in our hearts. It&#39;s a part of us and we like <br/>\nto share it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think from the &quot;outside&quot;, yes, it can look clique-ish. But cliques are <br/>\nthere to keep people OUT. We are DYING to share unschooling with you and ANYone <br/>\nwho wants it! That&#39;s why we put SO many hours into it. SOOOO many hours! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe say over and over and over to read, read, read. Because there&#39;s not a <br/>\nquestion that I&#39;ve heard in a year, that hasn&#39;t been asked and answered already <br/>\nSEVERAL times here and on the boards. And yet we keep answering them, because <br/>\nthere are more newbies coming in every day. I&#39;d love to see the list become a <br/>\nplace that unschooling is discussed, not re-hashed (and there IS one list like <br/>\nthat, for already-unschoolers)---but I&#39;ll happily join in and re-hash again and <br/>\nagain---as we all do. THAT wish will maybe be realized with our <br/>\ngrandchildren&#39;s children---when unschooling IS the mainstream and school is &quot;alternative&quot;! &lt;<br/>\ng&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve all questioned unschooling and education and learning to the point that <br/>\nwe KNOW what we&#39;re talking about---and many say it SO well, I&#39;m just awed! <br/>\nWe&#39;ve recently questioned cliques---and we realize that we&#39;re NOT a clique <br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t keep people OUT, we welcome them IN. Because it is a questioning <br/>\ngroup, and we LOVE questions about unschooling, we&#39;re thrilled to introduce <br/>\nnewbies to Holt&#39;s principles---But we&#39;re not really good with those that want to <br/>\nwaste our time arguing the benefits of workbooks and curricula and external <br/>\nmotivation and school (and spanking! &lt;g&gt;). It&#39;s a waste of time on an <br/>\nunschooling e-list. They can go somewhere else, because there are MANY more lists that <br/>\nwill happily cover those things----and tell how important they are to your <br/>\nchild&#39;s well-being. We disagree.. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a reason this list is so big. And it&#39;s not because people don&#39;t feel <br/>\nwelcome (although there are obviously some!). We&#39;re not pushing this down <br/>\nfolks&#39; throats. *They* come *here*---on their own accord. They are &quot;guests&quot; until <br/>\nthey feel a part of the family (Got that Brenda? &lt;g&gt;)---but THEY have to make <br/>\nthat decision to be a part of the family----or not. It&#39;s up to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI subbed and unsubbed three times before I settled in for good---because of <br/>\nthe icky bickering that went on. But I wasn&#39;t family *then*. I&#39;m VERY <br/>\ncomfortable here now. I won&#39;t leave. You and everyone else has that option too. &quot;It it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fit, you can always quit.&quot; (to botch the OJ lawyer)  You *might* be <br/>\nback---many do that because they realize that it&#39;s worth it. You may not. It&#39;s <br/>\nup to you, not the list, because the list is what it is---and it does its job <br/>\nVERY well.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t easy---to grasp or to implement---AT FIRST. It gets easier <br/>\nand easier the more you *do* it. It&#39;s life-changing and awe-inspiring and <br/>\nSOOOO kid-friendly! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI know that newbies don&#39;t know that and I know that when they first come <br/>\nhere, it seems sooo &quot;in your face&quot;. That&#39;s why we ask that they read, read, read. <br/>\nBecause that way they can get a feel of what each poster is like----OVER <br/>\nTIME---and they can get a feel for the dynamics of the list---plus, they can see <br/>\ntheir own questions already in print ---and answered. We&#39;re NOT trying to brush <br/>\nanyone off. We&#39;re TRYING to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would help to understand that and to picture every one of us <br/>\nwanting you to GET unschooling (and as Sandra says----offer *our* kids more options <br/>\nfor future mates! &lt;G&gt;) than to picture us as the unschooling elite who don&#39;t <br/>\nwant you in our &quot;club&quot;. We DO want you in our &quot;club&quot;---and we want you there <br/>\nas quickly as possible, so no namby-pamby talk from us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSit back, read, read, and read some more. Attend a conference as soon as you <br/>\ncan afford it, and PLAY and BE with your children. Ask us questions: we are <br/>\nhere to answer them. But please don&#39;t bitch and moan about our delivery systems. <br/>\nWe are all different, and you can choose one you like the best---and some of <br/>\nus will even take &quot;private&quot; consultations via e-mail. Just ask your favorite <br/>\nposter whether s/he&#39;s willing. S/he can only say , &quot;no&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78350,"nextTopicId":78434}}
