I picked out some good inexpensive books and cassette tapes and kept them stashed away so that I could pull these things out intermittently through out the trip. For my ten year old books on tape were great. For the younger ones, crayons, arts and crafts and games and songs were funner. we stopped a lot along the way and got out to stretch and eat. This is such a great learning experience for them though. My kids learned more about goegraphy and our country this way then they have in any &quot;lesson.&quot; Have fun!
