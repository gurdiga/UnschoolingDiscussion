I then asked him, &quot;did you feel weird and out of place growing up<br/>\nbecause you were different?&quot; (he is 26 by the way, if anyone wanted to know,<br/>\ngrew up in Oregon)<br/>\nHe said, &quot;I didn&#39;t know I was any different growing up&quot;<br/>\nI asked, &quot;but what about the locker rooms and stuff?&quot;<br/>\nHe said, &quot;why would I be looking at another guy&#39;s penis?&quot;<br/>\nI asked, &quot;what about your dad?&quot;<br/>\nHe said, &quot;I haven&#39;t a clue if he&#39;s circumcised or not, I never noticed&quot;<br/>\nI asked, &quot;well, what about when you got older and started looking at pornos<br/>\nand stuff?&quot;<br/>\nHe answered, &quot;I still didn&#39;t know I was any different, I couldn&#39;t tell if<br/>\nthe guys were circumcised or not&quot;<br/>\nTurns out he didn&#39;t know that a large percentage of guys his age are<br/>\ncircumcised, he found that very odd.  He didn&#39;t know until I had told him<br/>\nwhen I was pregnant with our son.<br/>\nHe then said, &quot;You women are so weird sometimes, worrying about stuff as if<br/>\nit actually matters.  Most of this stuff about guys caring how big they are<br/>\nor what they look like I think just comes from what women think guys are<br/>\nlike.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had one older brother, but he is 10 years older, and he doesn&#39;t know if<br/>\nhe is circumcised or not because he never noticed or asked.  His mother<br/>\nnever told him he was different, so he never thought he was different.  He<br/>\nadmits he may have noticed something when he was very young if he saw<br/>\nsomeone else naked who was circumcised, but he doesn&#39;t remember that ever<br/>\nhappening so it must not have been a big deal if it did happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrightest Blessings!<br/>\nKristi &quot;Saga&quot; Weyland<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\nProud WAHMommy to Julian 11/12/98 and Sheherazade 11/13/00<br/>\nAttempting to be the &quot;perfect&quot; Natural Parent :) BF/CD/AP<br/>\nCheck out my Auctions at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ebaystores.com/ebennyz\">http://www.ebaystores.com/ebennyz</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23093,"nextTopicId":23280}}
