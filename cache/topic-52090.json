I rounded up 3 other <br/>\nkids and dropped them off at the theatre.   Anna and I knocked around <br/>\nWal-mart for a couple of hours, then got some coffee ( and coke) and chatted <br/>\nin the van til the movie was over.   The kids were on such a high when they <br/>\ngot out.  It was so cool to see and hear thier reactions to the movie.  The <br/>\ngirls who are already &quot;in love&quot; with Legolas, swooned and raved over how <br/>\n&quot;sassy&quot; he was in this movie.. LOL.  Evidently, sassy is another term for <br/>\n&quot;hot&quot;..  The boys made similar remarks about the ladies in the film, although <br/>\nthey said their one complaint about the movie is that there are not enough <br/>\nchicks in the movie.    I will have to say, the sacrifice of staying up til 4 <br/>\nam was well  worth it.  The kids were so grateful that I took them to the <br/>\nmovie.  The other 3 teens said their parents absolutely refused to take them <br/>\nout at that time of night ( morning) .. not because of curfew ( obviously, <br/>\nthey let them go with me)  but because of the inconvenience.    Thier <br/>\ngratitude and the rise in my &quot;cool mom factor&quot; , even though it was already <br/>\npretty high, lol, was soooo worth missing a few hours of sleep.    I also <br/>\nfelt very privilidged that the kids talked openly and freely about stuff at <br/>\nschool, other kids and thier problems or situations,  sexual orientation,  <br/>\ndrugs and alcohol, and other &quot;teen issues&quot;, among themselves with no concern <br/>\nabout me overhearing.  It was obvious that didnt temper their conversation <br/>\nfor my benefit.    I even chimed in occasionally with my 2 cents.   Anna was <br/>\nthere too, of course, and I know she got an &quot;education&quot; on some of the real <br/>\nlife issues of being a teen..   All in all , it was a great experience.   <br/>\nLandon is going back to see LOTR TT again tonight with another friend who <br/>\ngraduated from high school last year.  He is so psyched to see it again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

The <br/>\ngirls who are already &quot;in love&quot; with Legolas, swooned and raved over how <br/>\n&quot;sassy&quot; he was in this movie.. LOL.  Evidently, sassy is another term for <br/>\n&quot;hot&quot;..  The boys made similar remarks about the ladies in the film, although <br/>\nthey said their one complaint about the movie is that there are not enough <br/>\nchicks in the movie.    I will have to say, the sacrifice of staying up til 4 <br/>\nam was well  worth it.  The kids were so grateful that I took them to the <br/>\nmovie.  The other 3 teens said their parents absolutely refused to take them <br/>\nout at that time of night ( morning) .. not because of curfew ( obviously, <br/>\nthey let them go with me)  but because of the inconvenience.    Thier <br/>\ngratitude and the rise in my &quot;cool mom factor&quot; , even though it was already <br/>\npretty high, lol, was soooo worth missing a few hours of sleep.    I also <br/>\nfelt very privilidged that the kids talked openly and freely about stuff at <br/>\nschool, other kids and thier problems or situations,  sexual orientation,  <br/>\ndrugs and alcohol, and other &quot;teen issues&quot;, among themselves with no concern <br/>\nabout me overhearing.  It was obvious that didnt temper their conversation <br/>\nfor my benefit.    I even chimed in occasionally with my 2 cents.   Anna was <br/>\nthere too, of course, and I know she got an &quot;education&quot; on some of the real <br/>\nlife issues of being a teen..   All in all , it was a great experience.   <br/>\nLandon is going back to see LOTR TT again tonight with another friend who <br/>\ngraduated from high school last year.  He is so psyched to see it again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] LOTR and drool factor","postDate":"1040206540","msgId":52139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMjE4MTAxNTQwLjYxNjEzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGF0cDgwbStmYXIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52136,"nextInTopic":52149,"prevInTime":52138,"nextInTime":52140,"topicId":52090,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And don t forget Legolas,   that s probably why I liked Malfoy too,   the blonde mane?  maybe?
