Is it legal to change your own?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shouldn&#39;t you let a trained professional do it? Won&#39;t your little lamp<br/>\n&gt; be brighter if someone who studied for four years (after barely being<br/>\n&gt; able to turn on their own<br/>\n&gt; lamp) changes your light bulb? What if you screw it in wrong? What if<br/>\n&gt; you leave something out? Don&#39;t you think you should give your little<br/>\n&gt; nursery lamp a chance to<br/>\n&gt; be part of a huge, glowing marquee or chandelier? Bulbs do need to hang<br/>\n&gt; in groups, you know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Besides, why do you think light bulbs come in multi packs? You don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; just go out and get a single light bulb! If one light bulb needs fixing,<br/>\n&gt; then you know the others<br/>\n&gt; are ready for it, too. Give your professional a 12 pack and let him/her<br/>\n&gt; change them all at once. It&#39;s much more efficient and gets you on a<br/>\n&gt; schedule with all your light<br/>\n&gt; fixtures. And yes, I know you will end up sending some perfectly good<br/>\n&gt; light bulbs to the trash that way, but on the whole it&#39;s best. Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; regret the ones that are lost<br/>\n&gt; to the dump. They were probably pretty dim anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Look, I sent my lamps to the shop for light-bulb changing and my lamps<br/>\n&gt; work okay, don&#39;t they? Oh, well, except for that three-way lamp in the<br/>\n&gt; living room which<br/>\n&gt; got a stupid 40 watt, low-lumens bulb put in when it should have gotten<br/>\n&gt; a three way bulb with up to 200 watts. I was a little peeved at that at<br/>\n&gt; first, but I just put the<br/>\n&gt; lamp over in the corner where I never sit to read, so it&#39;s okay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Coyright 2000 by Clare Bussjaeger but feel free to share if you get a<br/>\n&gt; kick out of it and will retain my copyright notice including this entire<br/>\n&gt; sentence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; 25% Off All Prints!<br/>\n&gt; Buy one today at Corbis.com<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3357/7/_/448294/_/955729811/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3357/7/_/448294/_/955729811/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8106,"nextTopicId":8159}}
