Let s face it, in the Christian community, you just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1006817547\">I agree that Christians need to start getting the truth about spankings<br/>\nout in the Christian community.  Let&#39;s face it, in the Christian<br/>\ncommunity, you just don&#39;t hear about things unless you are looking for<br/>\nthem or they are preached from the pulpit, Christian magazines, radio or<br/>\nwebsites.  When you start talking about not spanking, many will suspect<br/>\nyou are criticizing and interfering in their parenting.  Some will<br/>\nsuspect you are the antichrist, trying to interfere in their freedom of<br/>\nreligion.  They certainly will not listen unless the Christian &quot;expert&quot;<br/>\nhas said it is so.  I speak firsthand, because these all went through my<br/>\nhead when I first heard someone call hitting my light little swat on my<br/>\nson&#39;s well-cloth-diaper-padded plastic-pants rear at the bank to show him<br/>\nI meant business (I had already chased him down and got back in line<br/>\nthree times).  I was not angry at my son, really.  I just felt like he<br/>\nwas testing me to see what his boundaries were and what would I do if he<br/>\ndid not do what I said.  Of course, now I see I was ALL wrong!  But when<br/>\nthe man in line in front of me said, &quot;Do you always hit your kids in<br/>\npublic?&quot;  I got in his face and aggressively said, &quot;Yes!  Always!  Do you<br/>\nhave a problem with that?&quot;  I&#39;m sure I confirmed his opinion that I was<br/>\nsome sort of violent, fanatical spanking maniac.  I truly felt that he<br/>\nwas challenging my authority and was sending a message to my children<br/>\nthat they could not trust me.  I felt very mother bearish.  Now I am<br/>\nconvinced that God sent that man to the bank that day to test me, and<br/>\nrather than politely question his views, I shut off any hope for<br/>\ncommunication by my demeanor.  I was close-minded and rude.  And I paid<br/>\nfor it by seven more years of misunderstanding my role as parent.  Over<br/>\nthe years, I would occasionally meet Christians who didn&#39;t spank, but<br/>\nwhat they did seemed more cruel to me, like shutting them in a room or<br/>\ngrounding them so they could never socialize.  It also seemed like too<br/>\nmuch work for the parent.  The church I presently attend is the first one<br/>\nI&#39;ve ever been to where the pastor dared to say the way of gentleness and<br/>\npatience is better than spanking.  And to hear what he does when his kids<br/>\ndon&#39;t do what he wants/says almost made me faint.  I mean literally pass<br/>\nout.  His gentleness was so alien to me that I almost couldn&#39;t conceive<br/>\nof it.  I learned parenting not from the church, but from my mom.  When I<br/>\nfirst had my oldest, I think I did it naturally and right until a<br/>\nbusy-body started telling me to discipline him better.  Before that, I<br/>\njust simply picked him up if he was headed for the fireplace with a &quot;No,<br/>\nno, hot.&quot;  My mother slapped, kicked, yanked, pulled and beat, but had<br/>\nother times of being very affectionate.  To me, a predictable, controlled<br/>\nspanking was better than the way she was.  But now I&#39;ve found a better<br/>\nway.  If someone had presented the information to me in a logical manner<br/>\nwith all the alternatives a long time ago, my children would have been<br/>\nbetter off.  I would have sought more information and I would have<br/>\nlearned the lessons then that I had to learn later, and I could have<br/>\nshown my husband a better way, too.  Oh well, better late than never. <br/>\nNow I don&#39;t believe in any form of negative discipline.  Not even time<br/>\nouts, except as a cooling off suggestion when someone&#39;s temper is wild. <br/>\nI am learning to relate to my children in a different manner.  Not that<br/>\nthere was a terrible relationship before, it is just much more mutually<br/>\nrespectful.  I am still learning the new ways, and it is so good to be<br/>\nchanging.<br/>\nI guess I needed to tell this story for myself.

And I mean a choice <br/>\nabout whether to do it as well as what to do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut about that getting a job and working with bosses and rules and <br/>\ndeadlines, etc.  this same kid has awesome work habits at his real <br/>\njob.
