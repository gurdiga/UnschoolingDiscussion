A certain calmness, an acceptance<br/>\nof who I am.   I hope in raising my kids the way I am,  they&#39;ll have that<br/>\nalot earlier.    Like what Sandra talked about yesterday with Holly and her<br/>\nworld.   I want that for my kids.   So they don&#39;t have to struggle with it<br/>\nas an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie,  I think you&#39;re right in that he&#39;ll outgrow it.  He&#39;ll grow up,<br/>\nall too soon.   I have to keep reminding myself how young my children still<br/>\nare,  10, 8 and almost 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think there are introverts and extraverts.  I am an introvert, but<br/>\nwhen I wasn&#39;t comfortable in my own skin I wanted someone with me.  Not lots<br/>\nof people,  just someone else,  to maybe take my mind off me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still know alot of grown people who are this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67348,"nextTopicId":67353}}
