If its extended family, I just talk in generalities - I don&#39;t say much about unschooling but talk about research and how lots of people homeschool and mention a few glorious moments...With closer family ( older kids? spouse?) I would feel free to journal some of our days and/or moments (I do this anyway) and show it to them as an example of  how well unschooling is working...Leonie W. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59469462,"authorName":"Gerard Westenberg","from":"&quot;Gerard Westenberg&quot; &lt;westen@...&gt;","profile":"leonieann2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]  New to unschooling ( was Eminem","postDate":"1030407044","msgId":42105,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwY2IwMWMyNGQ3MCQxY2VmMGVhMCQ0ZjBkODY5MEBwYz4=","referencesHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDEzREM3MkNAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42106,"prevInTime":42104,"nextInTime":42106,"topicId":42105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know if anyone will care about this...but I am a ...

But it really is debate. Many times, I delete and just read what I want..Other times, I read it all ( when I have time :-) ). It has all been useful to me in clarifying ideas on unschooling. I have had my values questioned, I have learned to  really look at my kids, I have been given ideas on day to day stuff AND on the big picture. The message board at www.unschooling.com is also really good reading - I&#39;ve been reaidng through old posts there when I can....Don&#39;t give up on the list - it all seems new, I know the feeling, but post a few questions, a few ideas and you&#39;ll get into it - into unschooling and the list. :-)..Leonie W. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42048,"nextTopicId":41767}}
