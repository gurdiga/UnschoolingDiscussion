They shoot up up <br/>\ninto the air one by one very suddenly. It&#39;s not perfectly uniform but it&#39;s <br/>\nmore uniform than say a Dandelion as Dandelion seeds are much lighter.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if you can &#39;see&#39; what I mean but the seed catches the wind and <br/>\nshoots up. It may be only a few seeds go but they do seem to fly upwards. I <br/>\nguess they have to get a certain wind velocity to carry them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                           HTH Elaine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
