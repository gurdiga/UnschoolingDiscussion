One has to <br/>\nactively monitor thier childrens Internet activity and set down clear <br/>\nguidelines for Internet use.  I think the ideal situation for a teen <br/>\ngroup would be one where teens feel they can be open and <br/>\nstraightforward with thier comments and discussion without &quot;grown up&quot; <br/>\ninterference.. Yet, they still need that bit of unintrusive <br/>\nsupervision to insure that nothing totally inappropiate ensues. Its <br/>\nkind of a Catch 22.. Teens won&#39;t engage in peer to peer discussions <br/>\nand conversations if they think adults are going to be reading and <br/>\nmonitoring everything they say.  Remember when you were a teen?  Did <br/>\nyou want your parents to &quot;eavesdrop&quot; on your phone conversations, or <br/>\nread your notes passed at school?  Of course not. Although I do <br/>\nbelieve its a parents perogative to know whats going on in a teens <br/>\nlife, its up to the teen to confide in the parent.  As parents we <br/>\nhave to be aware of the risks that others pose towards our children. <br/>\nWe may trust our children,  but we can&#39;t trust everyone they come in <br/>\ncontact with.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion boards on unschooling.com do offer a good forum for <br/>\nteen homeschoolers in a &quot;message board&quot; format.  I like Yahoo groups <br/>\nfor email format groups.  Yahoo groups have many options that can be <br/>\nutilized for a more complete &quot;Online Community&quot;  Members of a group <br/>\nwill be more active and involved if they recieve email and do not <br/>\nhave to go to a site to post and respond to messages.  I have owned <br/>\nand moderated several yahoo groups and I am familar with all of the <br/>\nmanaging/maintaining issues involved.   I can create and promote a <br/>\ngroup for Home school teens on yahoo.  I will moderate posts and <br/>\nmembership to insure they group is not spammed to death or that <br/>\nany &quot;inappropiate&quot; members join the group.  I will have to be sort of <br/>\nan &quot;invisible monitor&quot; so the teens won&#39;t feel intruded upon.   Each <br/>\nfamily has the decide how involved they want to be in monitoring <br/>\ntheir teens involvement in a group community.  I can assure you that <br/>\nI will not allow anything inappropiate on the group.  I understand <br/>\nthat I have not gained the trust of folks on this group (and rightly <br/>\nso, no one here really knows me.. I would be cautious myself) I would <br/>\nsuggest that parents also join the group, but &quot;adults&quot; will not <br/>\nallowed to post messages.  Just get your foot in the door so you can <br/>\nlook in on the group and be assured that its all going smoothly.  <br/>\nDoes this sound like an acceptable approach to creating an online <br/>\ncommunity for Home schooled teens?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to create the group and start promoting it today.   I will <br/>\nset down guidelines and &quot;rules&quot; for membership on the group that will <br/>\nbe auto sent to every new member.   I will require each member to <br/>\nreply to the guideline letter so I know they have read it.
