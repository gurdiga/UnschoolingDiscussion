The last thing most people on an <br/>\nestablished list want to see is someone coming on to tell them that their <br/>\nlist is not performing the function the newbie sees for it.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nthat lists can&#39;t change and evolve, but they rarely do in response to a <br/>\nnewbie&#39;s complaints.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for seeking like minds . . . if you were doing more listening than <br/>\ntalking at first, you would have discovered that most of the people on this <br/>\nlist share at least *some* of your views.  Obviously, if you were looking <br/>\njust for libertarian unschoolers willing to become activists for freedom of <br/>\neducation, you&#39;d only find a few.  But if you were looking for unschoolers <br/>\nwho were interested in *exploring* ideas about freedom and activism, you <br/>\nprobably would have found a lot more.  I&#39;m sure you and I could find lots <br/>\nto agree on, for instance.  But when you start with the libertarian stuff, <br/>\n*assuming* that everyone will agree with you because you&#39;re sure it&#39;s the <br/>\nright path, then you lose me and probably a lot of others.  My libertarian <br/>\nbrother-in-law has managed to put me totally off that philosophy with his <br/>\nconstant, angry hatred of government in all forms.  He has completely <br/>\ndestroyed my daughter&#39;s relationship with my sister, all because she spent <br/>\na few years as a single parent on welfare.  (Like my granddaughter deserved <br/>\nto spend years in daycare just because her mother chose the wrong man to be <br/>\nher father.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am not young any more. I am not patient, and I am not optimistic these<br/>\n&gt;days regarding the future of homeschooling freedom, so I have been seeing<br/>\n&gt;some urgency in the struggle for it.

Added to that, I&#39;ve just been sent a copy of the NEA Game Plan<br/>\n&gt;against vouchers. I&#39;m sure they have a similar one against homeschooling (is<br/>\n&gt;that paranoid or a reasonable assumption?) We are, once again, looking a lot<br/>\n&gt;like an underdog in a world controlled so tightly by politics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I will, from now on, put my &quot;militaristic&quot; self on hold, and offer my<br/>\n&gt;limited unschool experience to those who ask. No excuses.  I promise.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can see where you&#39;re coming from, and I understand your concern.  I do <br/>\nthink that you&#39;ll be much more effective having lost the bitter anger <br/>\nagainst *everyone* in the education system and the government.  I know that <br/>\nI can&#39;t buy the argument that they&#39;re all evil.  They may be *wrong*  &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nbut most of them aren&#39;t evil.  In fact, they&#39;re probably all the more <br/>\ndangerous just because they believe so strongly that they&#39;re doing what&#39;s <br/>\nbest for kids or the country, or whatever.  And I think they really and <br/>\ntruly do believe that.  I don&#39;t believe that most teachers are just out to <br/>\nprotect their jobs, though their union makes it sound as if they are.  I <br/>\nknow teachers who homeschool their kids, who believe in vouchers, <br/>\netc.  They do the best they can within the constraints of the system, but <br/>\nthey also don&#39;t subject their own kids to it having seen it from the inside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am not selling anything. I&#39;m not even a candidate for anything this year.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m merely anxious, more than ever, about our country losing, or jettisoning<br/>\n&gt;its freedoms in favor of &quot;security&quot; -- I&#39;m sure you know what Jefferson told<br/>\n&gt;us about that trade-off.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup.

I have a son who will probably never go <br/>\nto university (though I could end up eating my words - you can save them <br/>\nfor me if you want.)  My son is definitely not an unschooling poster boy by <br/>\nthat standard.  But I do believe he&#39;s going to be successful in whatever he <br/>\nends up doing with his life.  That and being relatively happy are my goals <br/>\nfor him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So now I can say, without my usual modesty, that unschooling works wonders.<br/>\n&gt;The satisfaction is invigorating, and I&#39;m afraid I spoiled a lot of that<br/>\n&gt;vigor by mixing it with my equal faith in libertarian ideals. If I was<br/>\n&gt;trying to sell something, it was liberty.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hey!  I&#39;ll buy that.

As the kids say now, I&#39;m cool with it. The baptism is over and I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;take a seat, happily.

The<br/>\n&gt; ultimate ego-trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dear Helen, <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re right, of course.  I respect you enormously.<br/>\n<br/>\nI arrived with expectations (from the list name alone) that I had found<br/>\nfellow-travellers, and almost immediately formed the impression that the<br/>\nlist was not performing the function I saw for it, so I started to make my<br/>\n&quot;inflammatory&quot; views known, still seeking like minds. At first, it seemed,<br/>\nthat people were in denial (can this list really be for &quot;newbies to<br/>\nhomeschooling&quot;?). As objections grew, I got annoyed -- Whassamatter, can&#39;t<br/>\nyou see what we need to do....?  -- I believed in the people who seemed to<br/>\nappreciate hearing my views, and got more and more annoyed at the<br/>\ncomplainers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not young any more. I am not patient, and I am not optimistic these<br/>\ndays regarding the future of homeschooling freedom, so I have been seeing<br/>\nsome urgency in the struggle for it. We&#39;ve been challengedthis year here in<br/>\n(ironically) the Constitution State (CT), and I arrived at this list still<br/>\nembittered by what our legislature almost did to us, without ever giving<br/>\nnotice. Added to that, I&#39;ve just been sent a copy of the NEA Game Plan<br/>\nagainst vouchers. I&#39;m sure they have a similar one against homeschooling (is<br/>\nthat paranoid or a reasonable assumption?) We are, once again, looking a lot<br/>\nlike an underdog in a world controlled so tightly by politics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will, from now on, put my &quot;militaristic&quot; self on hold, and offer my<br/>\nlimited unschool experience to those who ask. No excuses.  I promise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not selling anything. I&#39;m not even a candidate for anything this year.<br/>\nI&#39;m merely anxious, more than ever, about our country losing, or jettisoning<br/>\nits freedoms in favor of &quot;security&quot; -- I&#39;m sure you know what Jefferson told<br/>\nus about that trade-off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t &quot;waited until now&quot; to make my views known. If you&#39;ve checked the<br/>\nAED list, you know I&#39;ve been around, and as you know, Luz and I are writers<br/>\nof articles that get circulated some. I&#39;ve had actual occupations over the<br/>\nyears and parenting preoccupations that have held me at bay, so to speak.<br/>\nAlso, I wasn&#39;t sure that our educational experiment  (inspired wholly by<br/>\nreading and meeting John Holt)  would be completely successful until<br/>\nrecently when our unschooling &quot;poster boy&quot; graduated from college in the top<br/>\n2% of his class, with supreme confidence in his own future.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I can say, without my usual modesty, that unschooling works wonders.<br/>\nThe satisfaction is invigorating, and I&#39;m afraid I spoiled a lot of that<br/>\nvigor by mixing it with my equal faith in libertarian ideals. If I was<br/>\ntrying to sell something, it was liberty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, this clears the air for me -- I don&#39;t need the negatives any more than<br/>\nyou do -- I just had to push it to find out what the list was about, down<br/>\ndeep.  As the kids say now, I&#39;m cool with it. The baptism is over and I&#39;ll<br/>\ntake a seat, happily. I love talking about how our son raised himself as we<br/>\nlovingly watched and trusted him. It was thrilling, and I&#39;ll write a book<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for now -- and you are the right person to ask -- can you tell me, where<br/>\nis that vanguard I&#39;m looking for, and do you think I can help them, given my<br/>\nintense interest in improving the political climate in favor of<br/>\nhomeschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for everything.

Was that always the goal?  Top 2%?  What<br/>\n&gt;about kindness, inquisitiveness, contentment?  What about<br/>\n&gt;responsibility, honesty?  I know that your son is most likely all of<br/>\n&gt;those things and more.  But I feel unschooling is a success *every* day<br/>\n&gt;at every age, and that it can never be a failure.  Because I don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt;to make up the definition of success for my son&#39;s education, all I can<br/>\n&gt;focus on is parenting--and parenting doesn&#39;t get to claim the top 2%.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I want to clarify for everyone.  I understand a sense of relief when a<br/>\nchild passes certain milestones.  I was surprised how relieved I was<br/>\nwhen Will learned to read at age 7.  I&#39;m relieved when my 20 yo doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncome home from college asking me for money, and I&#39;m relieved when my 17<br/>\nyo comes home at 3:00 a.m. and hasn&#39;t been picked up for curfew.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe my standards are low, but I only concentrate on things I have any<br/>\ninfluence or control over.  I just can&#39;t get my hopes all worked up over<br/>\nmilestones as tenuous and uncertain as the top 2% of a graduating class.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the<br/>\nmoderator, Joyce Fetteroll (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> ) or the list owner,<br/>\nHelen Hegener (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
