We believe that homeschooling parents are intelligent enough to<br/>\n&gt; make up their own minds on political issues, and we would not presume to<br/>\n&gt; speak for them.  Homeschoolers are quite capable of speaking for themselves.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While the Home School Legal Defense Association has put together a political<br/>\n&gt; constituency, with its 60,000 members it still only represents a small<br/>\n&gt; fraction of the  estimated 1.5 million homeschoolers. Based on the issues on<br/>\n&gt; which HSLDA has chosen to focus, it is more accurate to describe the<br/>\n&gt; association&#39;s political agenda in conservative Christian advocacy terms than<br/>\n&gt; in homeschooling terms.  Because regulation of education in general, and<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling in particular, is a state issue, homeschoolers lobbying at the<br/>\n&gt; federal level are by definition addressing issues unrelated, or only<br/>\n&gt; marginally related, to homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You noted that as a nonprofit organization, HSLDA cannot endorse candidates<br/>\n&gt; without jeopardizing its tax-exempt status.  Political lobbying is another<br/>\n&gt; legal tightrope for nonprofits, yet HSLDA openly recruits, trains and has<br/>\n&gt; established an approval process for its lobbyists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The overall homeschooling population is tremendously diverse.  It makes no<br/>\n&gt; more sense to expect all homeschoolers to agree on politics than it would to<br/>\n&gt; expect all journalists to think alike.  But it would be a grave mistake to<br/>\n&gt; dismiss the rest of the homeschooling community&#39;s political strength simply<br/>\n&gt; because they do not play follow-the-leader.  Indeed, when HSLDA filed suit to<br/>\n&gt; overturn the Gun Free School Zones Act, homeschoolers in Texas and across the<br/>\n&gt; country, concerned that HSLDA was jeopardizing homeschool freedoms to further<br/>\n&gt; its own political agenda, mounted such a swift and powerful campaign in<br/>\n&gt; opposition that HSLDA was forced to withdraw its suit.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers as a group may well be better informed and more politically<br/>\n&gt; active than the average American, but as the movement grows, those watching<br/>\n&gt; would be wise to recognize its diversity.  It is misleading and dangerous to<br/>\n&gt; perpetuate the misconception that any segment of the homeschooling community,<br/>\n&gt; no matter how well organized, well funded, or vocal, speaks for all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; Laura Derrick<br/>\n&gt; Public Relations Director<br/>\n&gt; National Home Education Network<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Get paid for the stuff you know!<br/>\n&gt; Get answers for the stuff you donÂ’t.
