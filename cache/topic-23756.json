However, in areas that were<br/>\nhigh-decay the rate of decay actually increased in neighborhoods that had<br/>\nfluoridated water (9.4%)<br/>\nIn other studies, including the largest ever carried out (400,000 students)<br/>\nshowed that tooth decay actually increased when fluoride was added to water.<br/>\nIt is important to know exactly the number involved when making the decision<br/>\n(is it that important?).<br/>\nIn 1944, the Journal of the American Dental Association reported: ``With 1.6<br/>\nto 4 ppm fluoride in the water, 50 percent or more past age 24 have false<br/>\nteeth because of fluoride damage to their own.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFluoride compounds in fluordiated water is toxic waste and is often<br/>\ncontaminated with lead, arsenic, and radio nuclides (something to think<br/>\nabout if you live in a fluoridated area like I do).<br/>\nIt has also been linked to excessive hip fractures.  fluoride builds up in<br/>\nthe bones and causes bad changes to the bone structure.<br/>\nIn the UK one study showed that perinatal deaths was 15% higher than in<br/>\nnon-fluoridated areas.<br/>\nChina, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, The<br/>\nNetherlands, Hungary, and Japan have all rejected, banned, or stopped<br/>\nfluoridation of their water for various reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some information on where fluoride comes from and its effect on the<br/>\nhuman body, one possible site is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bruha.com/fluoride/\">http://www.bruha.com/fluoride/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BiVmZA2roFzxyJh4yfXY8NmeWep5bStVRpQi0edmmM6eTuwSwX8uivGr-RzyP0hT9p1YabWk9eC4v8xQWKhmKqYMMJW72SoMmMKhpKk5NWNviCagdw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: non-flouride toothpaste","postDate":"999034188","msgId":23786,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCOEMxQjVDLjExNjEyLkZEMzA4M0Bsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMxMzAwNyRmMjAxZTdjMCQzZTQyODBjYUBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":23784,"nextInTopic":23793,"prevInTime":23785,"nextInTime":23787,"topicId":23756,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yup :-) Tracy Your comment reminded me that the same applies to public schooling!\u000f Laurie\u000f \u000e Scary what s accepted as good and useful that s really \u000f \u000e really","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-374864963\">Yup :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\nYour comment reminded me that the same applies to <br/>\npublic schooling!\u000f<br/>\nLaurie\u000f<br/>\n\u000e Scary what&#39;s accepted as good and useful that&#39;s <br/>\nreally \u000f<br/>\n\u000e really not...\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n\u000e Tracy\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"M and L Hand","from":"&quot;M and L Hand&quot; &lt;mandlhand@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-4LYv39Zwl0fQQixF0vdJrGQMuqSldXYLxfISdMZsX_dZCi25d3TDDu7sbJ_Z60lydYJbHatccAqUTG6jvmR8IZk9pRpfqpqYvtj","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: non-flouride toothpaste","postDate":"999033920","msgId":23784,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMxMzAwNyRmMjAxZTdjMCQzZTQyODBjYUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDNCOEMxN0FBLjEzMTMyLkVFQkZEMEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":23781,"nextInTopic":23786,"prevInTime":23783,"nextInTime":23785,"topicId":23756,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Your comment reminded me that the same applies to public schooling!
