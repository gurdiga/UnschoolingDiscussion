But I really <br/>\nreally miss some of the kids that used to live here.  :-/  There was a 2yo <br/>\nboy who would happily dig in the dirt for what seemed like hours and then <br/>\nsuddenly, realizing his hands were dirty, scream to get them washed.  There <br/>\nwas a 4yo girl who could spend hours oh so carefully applying paint to paper. <br/>\nA 12yo boy who would happily capture the garter snakes that kept getting into <br/>\nthe house and release them in the hills. A 5yo girl who spent whole <br/>\nafternoons dancing and singing up and down the sidewalk, entertaining the <br/>\nneighbors. :) And many more....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m starting to see the end of my very last little girl (almost 10), she&#39;s <br/>\nbeing pushed out by hips and breasts and a sudden height increase that&#39;s made <br/>\nher significantly taller than her twin brother for the first time in their <br/>\nlives. She&#39;s not entirely thrilled about it yet. She&#39;s spent a lot of time <br/>\ntelling me she doesn&#39;t want to be a grownup yet and being reassured that her <br/>\nchanging body doesn&#39;t mean she has to change anything else she doesn&#39;t want <br/>\nto. And my big girl (17) is going to be off on her own in Manhattan for most <br/>\nof the summer, so it seems to be a year of big changes for all us girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Why I love my kid today :)","postDate":"1019059328","msgId":35186,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzLmExNTY0NzUuMjllZWY2ODBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35157,"nextInTopic":35280,"prevInTime":35185,"nextInTime":35187,"topicId":35122,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/17/02 6:45:44 AM, Wilkinson6@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-423646007\">In a message dated 4/17/02 6:45:44 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Wilkinson6@...\">Wilkinson6@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I have often thought back about my childrens youth and think in terms <br/>\nof separate little individuals I knew along the way. :-(   (-:  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll preface a story with &quot;One time Baby Marty...&quot; to a full group or to <br/>\nHolly or someone, instead of &quot;When Marty were little,&quot; especially if Marty&#39;s <br/>\nin the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they&#39;re sick, especially, they&#39;ve all liked to hear stories of when they <br/>\nwere little--things they&#39;ve forgotten or were to little to catch a memory of. <br/>\n And I&#39;ll tell them how much I loved this or that about them, but from my <br/>\npoint of view it IS like a different person.
