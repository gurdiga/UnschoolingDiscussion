It was like he was always walking<br/>\nthrough a fog bank, with no bearings and no idea what was in front of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe told him he didn&#39;t have to do anything he wasn&#39;t comfortable doing,<br/>\nand we would invite him to go but never make it mandatory.

Once he was comfortable with that, it<br/>\nexpanded some more to maybe two or three stops.

I have four children ages 14 to 22  months. <br/>\n <br/>\nI think you said your little boy is 4. At age 4 and the youngest  (or 2nd to <br/>\nyoungest) brings on new growth and independence. At 3-4 they see the  older <br/>\nsiblings going and doing and they come to realize they too want some of  that <br/>\ncontrol also. A stage or passage onto the next gear in their growth.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn smaller families those changes may not be as vocal. In larger  families a <br/>\ntoddler will seek to be their own person and if it  takes getting vocal about <br/>\nit so be it until it&#39;s clear as mud.  <br/>\n <br/>\nComputer and Lego&#39;s can be his way of shutting everyone out/his own thing  he <br/>\ncontrols.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;s four (still a little guy) and at times it can be difficult to balance  <br/>\neveryone. He will come round in time but he needs to finish his quest to be  <br/>\nheard, understood and his own person. Until then I would consider talking to the <br/>\n older ones and explaining his feelings. Maybe the older ones can help him <br/>\nmake  cookies or shop for Lego&#39;s or something that he may ask for or do. The <br/>\nidea is  to get there before he gets upset or feels out of control. If he reaches <br/>\nthat  frustration level too many times it will be a much longer span of time <br/>\nuntil he  feels better about his options.<br/>\n <br/>\nWith the age differences things can turn into &quot;me and them&quot;  ..that can be a <br/>\nchallenge to overcome those feelings.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n  Southern Maine Unschoolers<br/>\nSite:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.southernmaineunschoolers.com\">http://www.southernmaineunschoolers.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236402377,"authorName":"the bartels","from":"the bartels &lt;the.bartels@...&gt;","profile":"lunamama3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: My son doesn&#39;t want to go with us","postDate":"1138029401","msgId":111376,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzRDRGMzU5LjQwMzA4MDdAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgwMzhDMkMyLUI0RDUtNDQ1Qy1CNjM1LTUzRDJFMEVGRERDNEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGRyMTQ2NStsN2Z0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODAzOEMyQzItQjRENS00NDVDLUI2MzUtNTNEMkUwRUZEREM0QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":111373,"nextInTopic":111378,"prevInTime":111375,"nextInTime":111377,"topicId":111359,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... i just wanted to chime in a bit here.  when my son was younger, he was much more open to having new and different people in our home than he is now.  as","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1922207153\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;I know a family (maybe still on this list) whose older girls really  <br/>\n&gt;wanted to go go go and younger brother really did not.

His controlling the<br/>\nsituation sometimes means they don&#39;t get any control. It doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nfair. They&#39;ve already conditioned themselves to go along, to some<br/>\nextent, with what he wants because he&#39;s very forceful and demanding.<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier for them to go along. That doesn&#39;t seem right to me either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wish, I wish we could talk about stuff, but in the moment, it&#39;s<br/>\nalmost impossible to talk to him. While I&#39;m trying to figure out if<br/>\nthere&#39;s a way to make it more palatable, or trying to figure out if<br/>\nthere&#39;s a part that he doesn&#39;t like in particular that we could get<br/>\nrid of, he&#39;s yelling &quot;I&#39;m not going. Shut up!&quot; Sometimes I try &quot;you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to go (for real), but could you tell me why you don&#39;t want<br/>\nto go&quot;. I still get &quot;shut up&quot; or nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the moment, he doesn&#39;t bring it up. He goes on about his life as<br/>\nif nothing happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I try to talk about it, we either go right back to the &quot;shut up&quot;<br/>\nparts, or he&#39;ll say &quot;I&#39;m really sorry about what happened&quot;, which is<br/>\ncertainly less abrasive, but mostly feels to me like a gentler version<br/>\nof &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about this&quot;. I don&#39;t need or want him to say<br/>\nhe&#39;s sorry, I just want to know more about the situation and what<br/>\nbugged him about it. Is it just going out of the house? Is it going to<br/>\nthat particular place? Is it driving there? Is there any way to make<br/>\nany of the icky parts better so that the rest of us could go?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also feels sometimes like he speaks a different language. Says<br/>\nthings that he knows aren&#39;t true, almost daring me to get into an<br/>\nargument about those things. (&quot;The car is too cold.&quot; &quot;I could put on<br/>\nthe heat.&quot; &quot;No, the heat doesn&#39;t work.&quot; (except it does)) Where it<br/>\ngets to arguing about a provable fact, I don&#39;t say anymore.

I can&#39;t think of anything<br/>\nwe make him do except go places sometimes (once last week, I think).<br/>\nWell, we don&#39;t let him yell mean stuff at his sisters or hit them or<br/>\nthrow stuff at them. But that&#39;s about it. We don&#39;t make him do chores,<br/>\nwe don&#39;t make him do schooly stuff, we don&#39;t make him eat stuff he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to, we mostly don&#39;t make him go out if he doesn&#39;t want<br/>\nto, we do let him play on the computer and play legos as much as he<br/>\nwants. We play games with him and read to him when he asks. What else<br/>\ncould he control that we&#39;re not letting him?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is it enough?

There are five of us in the family, dd8, ds7,<br/>\nand dd4 and lately every time we want to go on an excursion, all of us<br/>\nwant to go except ds. I&#39;m not sure what to do about it. We wanted to<br/>\ngo to the science museum tomorrow for a special exhibit, and when we<br/>\nbrought it up he said &quot;I&#39;m not going.&quot; We wanted to go for a walk<br/>\ntoday, and he didn&#39;t want to go out. Last week we went to a play, he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to go. Last night he didn&#39;t want to go to dinner at a<br/>\nfriend&#39;s house. He just doesn&#39;t like to go out to do things. The<br/>\nproblem is that the rest of us do like to go to do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried to figure out what is the real problem... it seems like he&#39;s<br/>\nnot into the driving, but that&#39;s not the only thing. But mostly, he<br/>\nyells, screams and says &quot;you can&#39;t make me&quot; and starts throwing things<br/>\nand making angry faces. If you heard it from the street you&#39;d think,<br/>\nboy they must always be dragging him around, but actually that&#39;s not<br/>\nthe case. In many situations, we split up and either dh or I stay<br/>\nhome. I know he&#39;s just not the kind of person who likes to go out a<br/>\nlot. So mostly we don&#39;t make him. We don&#39;t sign him up for things, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t make him go to things, we respect his need to be alone and/or at<br/>\nhome. We&#39;ve even experimented with leaving him alone for short periods<br/>\nof time. But what do we do when all four of us want to go and he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t and he can&#39;t stay home alone?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s about the particular destination. It&#39;s not like<br/>\nwe&#39;re making him go grocery shopping or something he really hates. We<br/>\ndon&#39;t make him do that. And when we&#39;ve made him go to something in the<br/>\npast, he always says he&#39;s glad to have gone. We can&#39;t let him stay<br/>\nhome alone yet. And there&#39;s only one friend&#39;s house he&#39;d like to go to<br/>\nand honestly, I just don&#39;t feel right asking them each time we want to<br/>\ngo somewhere if they can take him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I admit it hurts my feelings that he doesn&#39;t want to come with us.<br/>\nIt makes me feel terrible. I wish he wanted to come. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;d appreciate any advice you all have.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111363,"nextTopicId":111476}}
