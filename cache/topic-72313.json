I&#39;d look at distance education  <br/>\noptions offered by colleges and universities, too. Also - advertise  <br/>\nthat you have an interest and see if there are a couple of other teens  <br/>\nwith the same interest and see if you can find an adult with that  <br/>\nexpertise to offer a course for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not even consider a high school, by the way, unless I knew  <br/>\nsomething wonderful about that particular science teacher. Too many  <br/>\nobstacles to learning - other kids who don&#39;t want to be there, burned  <br/>\nout teachers, out-of-date materials, uneducated teachers (PE teachers  <br/>\nfrequently teach science courses), focus on testing and grading and not  <br/>\non learning, and so on. And then the kid ends up having to take the  <br/>\ncourse again in college, with nearly identical material. Might as well  <br/>\nget the college credit the first time through and use college years to  <br/>\nlearn something new.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, June 5, 2003, at 08:10 AM, Julie Bogart wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m curious about what your high school aged kids have done to<br/>\n&gt; learn about higher level science and math.
