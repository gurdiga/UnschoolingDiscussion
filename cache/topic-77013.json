They didn&#39;t let up, in fact got worse.  Heather tried<br/>\neverything she could think of or was suggested.  Some things, like<br/>\neliminating foods she was sensitive to, helped.  Nothing made a major<br/>\ndifference until they tried the algae.  (It&#39;s a special kind of algae that&#39;s<br/>\nharvested from a lake in California that is loaded with nutrients.  It&#39;s<br/>\nalso helped me some with chronic fatigue.)<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety<br/>\ndeserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4257114,"authorName":"Cathy Hilde","from":"Cathy Hilde &lt;childe@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-Discussion] to Tia - A drug problem","postDate":"1058761440","msgId":77013,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxQzM0RjA1LjNENDU3OUUwLmNoaWxkZUBzZXJ2aWNlcGFwZXIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77126,"prevInTime":77012,"nextInTime":77014,"topicId":77013,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tia, I have done some searching on this, but can t figure out what algae is.
