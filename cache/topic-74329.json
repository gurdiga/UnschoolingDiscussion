We&#39;ve got the campfire going, and 2 tents set up in the yard where the boys will sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my 2 daughters are over across the street helping a couple of girls pack their things and they will be pitching two more tents, in the other yard.

People will be getting up early for work in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould be interesting.
