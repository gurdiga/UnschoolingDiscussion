There are still many <br/>\nsites available. We&#39;ve done this in past years and it&#39;s always nice <br/>\nto have other families coming and going throughout the week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe park is 15 minutes to Jersey Shore beaches (Blemar and Spring <br/>\nLake). Half hour to Island Beach State Park. 20 minutes to Point <br/>\nPleasant. 3 miles from small grocery store and 6 miles to all major <br/>\nshopping amenities, restaurants and entertainment, etc. 10 minutes <br/>\nto County Park with canoe and Kayak rental for reservoir boating. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, while camping with multiple families, we&#39;ve kept it <br/>\npretty flexible and loose not doing too much planning so that <br/>\nfamilies and individuals can follow their own needs while providing <br/>\na great group experience. This camping trip is organized in such a <br/>\nfashion that being together doesn&#39;t mean anyone is obligated to <br/>\nfollow anyone else&#39;s agenda or schedule, however, there is always a <br/>\nlot of overlap, shared meals, shared bike trips, beach trips, etc. <br/>\nIf we&#39;re a large group, we try not to complicate the trip by <br/>\nexpecting or planning an entire group to do the same thing each day <br/>\nthroughout the week - but hey - sometimes even that happens!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state park itself offers:<br/>\n<br/>\nVisitor Center/Museum<br/>\n<br/>\nManasquan River for canoeing and fishing<br/>\n<br/>\n5 mile paved bike trail from park to Manasquan (ocean beach town)<br/>\n<br/>\nNature Interpretive Center<br/>\n<br/>\nDirt trails throughout the park for hikers, mountain bikes and <br/>\nhorseback riders<br/>\n<br/>\n19th Century Historic Allaire Village - tours and activities <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.allairevillage.org/\">http://www.allairevillage.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPine Creek Railroad (antique steam trains)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaygrounds<br/>\n<br/>\nBirdwatching<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the website: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/allaire.html\">http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/allaire.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCampground for tent sites or RV (no electric or water hookup) <br/>\n<br/>\nFees $20 per night for 2 tents, 6 people, 2 cars per site.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso has Yurts and Shelters (see link for descriptions) - though <br/>\nnone are available on the weekend at this time. There is a <br/>\nplayground right in the campground. Hot showers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo book campsite call (732) 938 2371. There are still sites <br/>\navailable. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry to be next too or near site #41 - but nothing is that far away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want more information or details contact me directly. Please <br/>\nspread the word and post this on other unschooling lists. <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Lmanathome@...\">Lmanathome@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26762,"nextTopicId":26786}}
