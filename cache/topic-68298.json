I unschool my 13 year old son, but my middle son is finishing <br/>\nhis senior year (or trying to) in public school.  As he says, he rarely goes, <br/>\nand when he does, he flunks.  Today he received a letter from the school <br/>\nsaying he is being given an award for his accomplishments!  We&#39;ve been <br/>\nlaughing for hours.  We have no clue what it could be for.  All I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nfrom the school lately is Charlie can&#39;t graduate because he missed gym too <br/>\nmuch (he has a medical excuse), he has an incomplete that has now turned to <br/>\nan E (which makes no sense, but hs teacher HAD sent a grade down; another <br/>\nfuck-up by the *guidance counselor*.  Anyway, my kids and I hate awards, but <br/>\nwe went to show my parents, knowing this would make their day. (Now they can <br/>\nbrag about THEIR grandchild like their friends do). Well, they were proud, <br/>\ndisgustingly so.  They didn&#39;t see the humor in it; honestly, he&#39;s the worst <br/>\nstudent.  We want to frame this letter!  My parents, however, actually think <br/>\nhe&#39;s going to the ceremony they hold, and hopefully it will be on local cable <br/>\ntv!  *gag*  He doen&#39;t go to class, so why would he attend either an awards <br/>\nassembly or his graduation.  My 13 year old was told by my parents that at <br/>\nleast his brother wasn&#39;t a *street urchin* and a *delinquent*.  Needless to <br/>\nsay, we didn&#39;t stay there long.<br/>\n I need something to punch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSue   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67770,"nextTopicId":68299}}
