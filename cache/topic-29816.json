The kind you take monthly.<br/>\nWe live in Phoenix, AZ. It is relatively dry and we don&#39;t get many mosquitos.<br/>\nOur vet is recommending the heartworm meds, though, because of a recent rise in heartworm reported locally.<br/>\nWe are considering it, but are wondering if it is really necessary.<br/>\nIf you think it is, what is the best brand, in your opinion?<br/>\nWe have a dog with fairly short hair (a vizsla).<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n(another) Karin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Karen Matlock <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 6:25 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE:dog vaccinations<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;I&#39;m a vet, so I&#39;m sticking my nose in here! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE:dog vaccinations","postDate":"1008035456","msgId":29830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMjEwLjIyMTI0OS4tMTU4ODkzLjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":29827,"nextInTopic":29834,"prevInTime":29829,"nextInTime":29831,"topicId":29816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Mon, 10 Dec 2001 19:25:49 -0600 Karen Matlock  ... your ... only ...

What vaccines you get for your<br/>\npets should depend on the environment they&#39;re in. An indoor cat may only<br/>\nneed rabies (state law). An outdoor one may need to be evaluated for risk<br/>\nfrom upper respiratory and leukemia viruses. When I practiced in an upper<br/>\nmiddle class town with well-cared-for dogs, I honestly thought parvo was on<br/>\nthe downswing. I changed to a large metropolitan practice, and I saw 1-4<br/>\nparvo cases a day in the summer. Distemper too, and I thought it was almost<br/>\ngone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to get another animal, I&#39;d vaccinate routinely for the first year<br/>\nand every three years after that, depending on where I was. Or I&#39;d have<br/>\nblood titers checked; that&#39;s what I do for my own rabies immunity!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n\r<br/>\n_________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?\r<br/>\nGet your free @... address at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mail.yahoo.com\">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29864,"nextTopicId":29868}}
