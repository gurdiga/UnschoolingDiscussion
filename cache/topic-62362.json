I felt like I was wasting my time. (Just ask my mom, TV is<br/>\na waste of time.) And I felt even more guilty letting my children watch<br/>\nit.  Thanks to this list, I was totally able to let that go.  We enjoy<br/>\nTV when we watch it now.   My kids have free reign to watch how much TV<br/>\nthey would like, but more often than not, the TV is off.  We just have<br/>\nbetter things to do most of the time.  The times we really enjoy it  are<br/>\nin the late afternoon or evening on days when we are tired.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t regulate a lot in my children&#39;s lives anymore, but TV was one of<br/>\nthe last things I was able to let go of.  I am so happy that I did.  It<br/>\nis so nice to not be the TV police and to have the children watch only<br/>\nwhat they really want to watch, not just watch because they are given an<br/>\nhour per day.
