We haven&#39;t tried chiropractic care yet.  We do <br/>\nhave an acquaintance who&#39;s a chiropractor, and right after Tess was born we <br/>\nasked him if he thought he could help her.  He told us that there was not <br/>\nmuch he could do for her if the brachial nerves were torn, which they are - <br/>\nor were - they&#39;ve since been repaired surgically.  He&#39;s also told us what you <br/>\nsaid about many babies being born out of alignment, probably due to the <br/>\nstrange delivery techniques doctors are known to use.  I don&#39;t know much <br/>\nabout the benefits of chiropractic - I may just have to look into it a little <br/>\nbit more.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing more about your experience with it.  <br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodye<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7829,"nextTopicId":7984}}
