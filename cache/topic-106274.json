She has a 4 year old, and is going to be homeschooling him, and asked <br/>\nif we could hang out, so she could get some of my wisdom (LOL). I really do <br/>\nwant to get together with this mom, but while we stood in the store, I told <br/>\nher my advice for right now: Play. Let him play. Be with him. Building the <br/>\nrelationship is more important than anything &quot;academic&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s already getting grief from those who don&#39;t think homeschooling is <br/>\ngood, as well as from the School At Home people. I said &quot;Don&#39;t do school at <br/>\nhome&quot; and she agrees, and says her hubby wants her not to do that. I was so <br/>\nglad she said hello to me. I didn&#39;t even remember her (to my embarassment. <br/>\nI&#39;m horrible with faces and names.
