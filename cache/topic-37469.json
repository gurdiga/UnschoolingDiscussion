","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-625856002\">Hi Marji,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve already received wonderful answers.  I only wanted to add that often<br/>\nthat &#39;perfectionistic&#39; attitude comes with boys and boys who are gifted.<br/>\nSomething about the testosterone/competition thing built into them, no<br/>\ndoubt.  My 7 year old is my 3rd child and thinks he should be able to do<br/>\nall my 13 and 16 year old children do.  He actually is at the same level as<br/>\nmy 13 year old in many concrete subjects like math, science, etc.  My 16<br/>\nyear old was complaining that he isn&#39;t finished with algebra yet so he<br/>\ncould be helping her!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m writing this just to let you know that he will learn sensitivity and<br/>\ncompassion for himself and others... it just takes time and some litte boys<br/>\ncome into the world with that wonderful drive to accomplish much and be<br/>\ngreat.  I am thankful that we are able to direct that energy a bit into<br/>\npositive and worthwhile avenues (as opposed to anti-social ones).  I would<br/>\npresume your son, Liam, may be a bit eccentric because he is highly<br/>\nintelligent and demanding of himself as a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nElaine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40,"nextTopicId":37486}}
