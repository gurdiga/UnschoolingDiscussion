Coincidentally, I just finished reading what I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1918775692\">Hi All:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been lurking and thought I would throw in my two-cents regarding handedness and brain dominance. Coincidentally, I just finished reading what I think is a tremendous book by Dr. David Sousa. It is called, &quot;How the Brain Learns.&quot; In the 5th chapter he discusses brain dominance as it applies to learning. Here is what he says about the hemispheres and handedness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe explains that the left-side of the brain is the logical hemisphere and deals with information in a factual way. It is responsible for the literal undertanding of language, generates speech and is time-sensitive. The left-brain controls the motor functions of the right-side of the body.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe right-side is intuitive, deals with spatial perception and interprets language through gestures, emotions, body language etc. The right-brain controls the motor functions of the left-side of the body.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll people use both sides of their brains because they are both necessary. In fact, the two-hemispheres are well-suited to operating simultaneously. This is why people can drive a car (right-brain spatial process) and talk (left-brain language process) at the same time. (This function improves when both hands are on the wheel !! Right and Left brain motor control)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, because the left-side of the brain is also largely responsible for processing details, if we talk while we drive, we may notice that we miss our exit. Talking and dealing with outside stimuli, ie. watching the road, are both left-brain functions which can cause interference (and accidents!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person is described as left or right-brain dominant it is a huge generalization that is usually referring to a specific event in a given moment. (You walk into a room and the first thing you sense is how the people in the room are relating, even though they haven&#39;t said anything, is an example of a right-brained cognition.) Whether you do this every time you walk into a room or not, forms the basis of  preference. The fact, that you will also consider what the people say to each other and you, demonstrates that your left-brain is also very active in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, identifying someone&#39;s hemispheric preference can&#39;t predict how a person will think or behave. Two people who share a preference for right-brain thinking will express themselves in very different ways. Our hemispheric preference is only one element out of a multitude of  personality and learning style indicators. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving made that disclaimer, there is a small correlation between left-handedness and right-brain thinking dominance. That is, 30% of left-handed people have been found to be right-brain dominant, whereas only 5 - 7% of right-handed people are right-brain dominant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means that the majority of people (70% of lefties and 93 - 95% of righties are left-brain dominant) making handedness, a highly unreliable indicator for indentifying right-brain dominant thinkers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this stuff! I teach workshops on personality and learning styles to companies and educators, so I have a vested interest in people getting correct information. I recommend Dr. Sousa&#39;s book as it is comprehensive and easy to read. There is a very good section on reading that can help people who&#39;s children have been identified as having a reading disability.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Bye for now,<br/>\n<br/>\nDona Baker<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] lefty","postDate":"1027639306","msgId":39442,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTQwMWMyMzQzMiQwYzAxMGRjMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PEI5NjYzODJFLkYzMCVhYnRsZW9AZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":39438,"nextInTopic":39478,"prevInTime":39441,"nextInTime":39443,"topicId":39438,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... my ...

I think it showed that since he is left-handed, he is right-brained,<br/>\nand he likes reading about various LB/RB studies that he finds. What he&#39;s<br/>\ntrying to do is finally figure out why he is the way he is. All these years,<br/>\nhe remembers teachers and peers alike picking on him because he was so<br/>\n&quot;different&quot;. He says he remembers acting, thinking, and just seeing the<br/>\nworld differently than most. He thinks it&#39;s because he&#39;s a lefty. He also<br/>\nsays that even today, it&#39;s very challenging for lefties to get along in this<br/>\nworld, because so many things are designed for right-handed people. I have<br/>\nstopped to think about it more and more and I&#39;ve got to admit he&#39;s right (or<br/>\nis that left ;-). Why, even the mouse for OUR computer is on the RIGHT side<br/>\nof the keyboard. But he is much more ambidextrous than me (I&#39;m a righty).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike most right-brained people (which I *think* studies show), he is not<br/>\nvery artistic or creative (so he says). So that part of his leftiness does<br/>\nnot concur with &quot;studies&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] lefty","postDate":"1027632087","msgId":39438,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NjYzODJFLkYzMCVhYnRsZW9AZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjc2MjU2NjMuMjI4NS40NjA3MS5tOUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39442,"prevInTime":39437,"nextInTime":39439,"topicId":39438,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 7/25/02 21:34, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at ...
