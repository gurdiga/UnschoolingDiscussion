I&#39;m sickened by the whole thing...Every time I \ndrive by the Red Oaks COmmunity or Fir HIlls....Deer Lake......where all the \nthings they name themselves after are ripped out &amp; have been removed...what \ndo these names symbolize..In Memory OF?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way not to \nparticipate in the destruction is Not to buy their products.&nbsp; And to speak \nup when given the oppurtunity.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Michelle, Dana &amp; Zain Harper<br>The Great \nNorthWest Washington<br>Legendary Tree &amp; \nLandscape<br></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13061,"nextTopicId":13063}}
