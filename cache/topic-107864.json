Kids at school <br/>\nwere<br/>\nmean to him, his mom was mean, his dad liked his older brothers better <br/>\n(wasn&#39;t<br/>\nmean, just ignored him a lot apparently).   So when I would ask &quot;What <br/>\ndid you<br/>\nget for Christmas when you were four (or five or whatever) he would <br/>\nvery<br/>\nhonestly say &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, Ben honestly couldn&#39;t remember anything before he was 15/16. I <br/>\nremembered down to three-ish.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I said &quot;Don&#39;t you remember!?&quot; he would say no, and I would say <br/>\nWELL I<br/>\nDO, so trust me, he does have feelings and he DOES have awareness, and <br/>\nwhat we<br/>\ndo now will be part of who he is for life.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Didn&#39;t say all that in one sitting.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;G&gt; I think remembering how you felt as a little one is soooo <br/>\nimportant. And when we say that we&#39;re trying to be the parents we wish <br/>\nwe had had, the connection is there---if you can remember. That part <br/>\nwas hard for Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&quot;He&#39;s five, he should know better!&quot; *I* would counter with, &quot;Well,<br/>\n*you* are 38!

I felt like a heal when I said <br/>\nit the first time. I also told him to ask his mother whether she only <br/>\nhad to tell him *once*---&lt;G&gt; That did wonders! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith too, to   me.

He <br/>\nstill struggles with nine! &lt;g&gt; But we have Cameron&#39;s history, which is <br/>\nfresher in his mind. He has the teenage thing down pretty well!

That sounds effective but scary. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess our version of that has been to remind the other parent that the <br/>\nchild is genetically likely to be that way for life.   Marty&#39;s failings are like <br/>\nKeith&#39;s, and Keith hasn&#39;t gotten over them.   Kirby&#39;s like me.   Holly&#39;s still <br/>\nless easy to guess and read, but that&#39;s fine.   She&#39;s #3 and we&#39;re already <br/>\nrelaxed with her.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking just this morning as I gathered trash from around the house in <br/>\na clear plastic bag the city provides free that... (long intro to my point, <br/>\nsorry) ...when Kirby was little we couldn&#39;t use the free city bags.   We still <br/>\ngot them and stockpiled them and used them for other things, but we had to buy <br/>\nblack plastic trashbags because Kirby didn&#39;t want us to throw away ANYthing <br/>\nthat looked fun or potentially useful.    And I (being me) was TRULY not <br/>\nthrowing stuff away lightly.   I still have broken toys from when they were little.  <br/>\n So if Kirby&#39;s packrattish, we can&#39;t expect him to outgrow it, because I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Ben&#39;s got it now.
