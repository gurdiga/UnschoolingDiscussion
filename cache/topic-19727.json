Anyhow, the most unexpected thing happened. Since then, <br/>\nshe **rarely** asks to turn it on! She is always walking around with<br/>\na book in her hand. She gets a huge stack of books every week at the <br/>\nlibrary and reads every single one of them! Now, she liked to read <br/>\nbefore, but she loves, LOVES, L-O-V-E-S to read now. She told me she <br/>\nstills loves TV, and always will, but that books are her &quot;favorite&quot; <br/>\nthing. This, from a girl who picked out slippers from KMart that <br/>\nlooked like two huge TV remote controls and wore them so much that in <br/>\nless than four months she wore the bottoms right off! <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19604,"nextTopicId":19735}}
