Then if they are <br/>\nstill worried maybe they can &quot;hire&quot; mom, dad or an older sibling to be their <br/>\nproof-reader - just for spelling.  In most dictionaries there is a page with <br/>\nproof-reader marks and what they mean... the &quot;employee&quot; could then use these to <br/>\nmake spelling suggestions...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my older kids (now graduated from high school and college) were in 2nd <br/>\ngrade ps they encouraged &quot;creative writing&quot;.

But as I relaxed... and my perfect spelling daughter relaxed ... I <br/>\ndiscovered that the kids really did learn how to write more creatively when <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t worrying about the spelling when they were writing... the grammar <br/>\nchecking and spelling checking came later.  And they had friends help them with <br/>\nthat... <br/>\n<br/>\nJust sharing some ps experience that may help in this situation.
