There are teachers who get excited by <br/>\nthe existence of such rare students.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how Kirby&#39;s teachers are feeling about him, but I needed to <br/>\ncorrect something I think I wrote here.  I said I thought he was hanging out with <br/>\npeople his own age, but he told me a couple of stories the other day.  He was <br/>\ntalking through the last few things he wanted to be sure to do and one was to <br/>\n&quot;get Michelle&#39;s contact information.&quot;  (I don&#39;t remember her real name, so I <br/>\nloaned her &#39;Michelle.&#39;)  She was his regular math partner.  I assumed she was <br/>\nsomeone his age, but didn&#39;t ask.   He mentioned that she had a 14 year old <br/>\ndaughter, and so I added up and thought she must be at least 30.  I asked him and <br/>\nhe shrugged and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but she talked about her daughter working <br/>\nat Subway, so I thought she might be 14.&quot;  I said probably more like 16, that <br/>\nfew places would hire 14 year olds and he had been an exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told a story of someone else in the class commenting that they got along <br/>\nso well they should become a couple, and her saying, &quot;But I&#39;m married,&quot; and <br/>\nlaughing.  So he does have older friends.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he named another person, maybe my age he said (I&#39;m 51), who had a hurt <br/>\nankle early in the semester and asked for a ride one day (just to the class in <br/>\ngeneral) and he gave her a ride, and offered her a ride every time until it <br/>\njust became the routine that he would drive her home.   She gave him $10 for gas <br/>\nmoney the other day, and he said he accepted it and told her that of all the <br/>\npeople who had ever offered him gas money, she was the only one who&#39;d actually <br/>\ngiven him any. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for two months he&#39;s been driving an older woman to her apartment after <br/>\nevery class and didn&#39;t think it worth mentioning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems interesting to me.
