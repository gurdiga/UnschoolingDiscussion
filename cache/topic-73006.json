I loved them all, <br/>\nbut I was not the primary caregiver of any animal until I adopted <br/>\nmy cat, Winston, in college. I had no trouble accepting that <br/>\nresponsibility, and he is still with me today, 17 years later. We <br/>\nnow have three cats and one rat, the youngest cat and rat <br/>\nbelonging to my son, who is 8. He adores them, and loves to <br/>\nplay with them some every day, but he is too busy to give them <br/>\nthe level of care and attention they need to thrive. So I clean and <br/>\nfeed, groom and play with all of them. I wouldn&#39;t want them to <br/>\nsuffer from lack of attention, and I don&#39;t want him to miss out on <br/>\nthe joy of having pets, just because he is too young to completely <br/>\ncare for them. Besides, I adore them, too. He has been <br/>\ninterested in a variety of pets, and we always researched their <br/>\nneeds and discussed whether or not we could give them what <br/>\nthey needed and also get what we wanted from a companion <br/>\nanimal. The deciding factor has always been whether I, mom, <br/>\nam willing to accept full responsibility for the lifetime care of the <br/>\nanimal. If not, then we don&#39;t get it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, my son has a friend, the same age, who impulsively <br/>\nwants every animal he sees in the pet store. They get it, without <br/>\nhaving any idea how to care for it, and it dies shortly thereafter. <br/>\nThen they just go get something else. He teases animals, <br/>\nscreams at them to scare them, and throws rocks. He has gone <br/>\nthrough literally dozens of hamsters; I shudder to think. Instead <br/>\nof learning love and compassion, he is indirectly being taught <br/>\nthat animals are disposable.<br/>\n<br/>\nlisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72997,"nextTopicId":72893}}
