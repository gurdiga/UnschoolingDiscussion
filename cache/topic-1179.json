Our particular h/s<br/>\ngroup is made up  of a really good mix of humanist-types and Christian-types<br/>\n- otherw have said that we have something special over here because of that<br/>\nflexible configuration - and we all like it this way, so we can learn from<br/>\neach other.<br/>\nHere&#39;s a coopy of an article I&#39;m writing for our July issue newslwetter.<br/>\n(Oh, yeah, anyone got any true life h/s stories they would allow me to<br/>\npublish - we still need to keep focussed on wghat schools and ttheir<br/>\nadministrators do wrong.<br/>\nArticle:<br/>\nGregg Thorn<br/>\nWhen I look at the �culture� that schools have become, I get the feeling<br/>\nthat something is amiss, something is wrong.  Sure, we all seem to survive<br/>\nour own school culture, to some degree or another, but still there was<br/>\nalways an unpleasant or intimidating or frustrating or<br/>\ndisincentive-to-learning factor that  was part of our school life. And maybe<br/>\ntodays school culture is different to what it was for us who are now the<br/>\nparents.<br/>\nBut what is it that niggles away at my total <br/>\nacceptance of the modern school system as the �only way to go�?<br/>\n\tTo help me analyse my feeling I�ve tried to break down my apprehension into<br/>\ndefinable <br/>\nareas:-<br/>\nParental Involvement: <br/>\nFor me, life is more than schooling, and the priority in the education of <br/>\nmy children is, firstly, their character - then their ability to relate<br/>\nappropriately, with a right degree of concern, to other people. Sure, the<br/>\nability to earn money - the <br/>\nmedium by which we buy, sell, trade and therefore exist on a daily basis in<br/>\nthis society - is important, but without the foundation of integrity and<br/>\ncompassion and the ability to discern right from wrong, the earning of money<br/>\ncan become a crutch that leads psychologically to self-destructive habits<br/>\nand lifestyle.<br/>\nThe parent is the primary character-teacher - not the custodial carer, not<br/>\nthe school teacher, not the �district officer�, not the legislators or the<br/>\npolicy makers. Character training comes mainly from observing mum and dad,<br/>\nuncles and aunts, grandparents, and other influential adults in a child&#39;s<br/>\nlife. But those influential adults must express love towards that child -<br/>\n�love� here, is the dominant ingredient for forming character. <br/>\n\tWithout love it�s very difficult for a balanced value system to form,  let<br/>\nalone a balanced emotional, and social, outlook. So when kids are deprived<br/>\nof this parental presence for a whole 7 or more hours a day, five days a<br/>\nweek - one wonders what replaces that intimate and �normal� input, or if<br/>\nanything indeed does replace it.<br/>\nI personally feel that parental involvement should not only be encouraged in<br/>\nschools, but should be essential. For me this is one aspect of true<br/>\n�community schooling� that really starts to normalise the limited and<br/>\nartificial similar-aged peer socialisation that exists today in the current<br/>\nschool system.<br/>\nAlso, the presence of community, in the form of parents, especially in the<br/>\nplayground area of the schoolyard during recess and lunchtime and before and<br/>\nafter the �classroom� hours of school, would most certainly lower the<br/>\nincidence of bullying, drug trafficking, negative peer behaviours, abuse of<br/>\nteachers, and would also decrease the opportunity for paedophilic<br/>\nactivities.<br/>\nTeachers:<br/>\nI personally know some school teachers, and there are a number of home<br/>\nschooling parents who are, or have been, teachers. School teachers can be<br/>\nthe most concerned and caring people - some are - but they can�t take the<br/>\nplace of parents, can�t develop the same kind of relationship with a child<br/>\nthat a parent has - it�s not their role, nor do I know of any who think of<br/>\nit as their role. Their role is to deliver an educational package to the<br/>\nstudents who are compulsorily put into their charge. Not many families have<br/>\n25 or more kids in their care for 7 hrs of daylight time, five days a week -<br/>\nbut teachers have to operate in such a situation. It�s not a natural setting<br/>\nthat is found in any human family, so the teachers shouldn�t expect, nor be<br/>\nexpected, to be �family� to their students. Their role is to impart<br/>\nknowledge - and impart it according to a procedure laid down by others -<br/>\nothers who are not as intimately involved in this imparting of knowledge as<br/>\nteachers are. Lets not examine teachers in this analysis of the system -<br/>\nlets examine the system, and the mindset that can only envisage this type of<br/>\nsystem as being the �best for all�.<br/>\n�Custodial Care� mentality:<br/>\nThe family, the parents, and the extended family, are the natural and<br/>\noptimal nurturing growth unit for any child. �Custodial care� - often touted<br/>\nas a viable alternative to the family - can never ever provide the nurturing<br/>\nand emotionally balanced environment that the family unit can - or indeed<br/>\nthat a �fostering� family unit can.<br/>\nYes, sadly, there is abuse in individual families, and even cultural forms<br/>\nof �abuse� among certain ethnographic philosophies. But the record of<br/>\ncustodial care in the area of abuse generally far outweighs the negative and<br/>\ndetrimental effect that any one individual family can have on the lives and<br/>\npotential of children.<br/>\nThe ABC�s weekly TV current affairs item, The 7:30 Report,  recently aired a<br/>\nstory documenting a report on the widespread institutionalised abuse of<br/>\nchildren in both state-run, and church-run, �children�s homes� in Queensland<br/>\n- the lesson is that its easy for abuse to happen where many children are<br/>\nconfined in a location with a minimum number of �carers� - none of whom are<br/>\ntheir parents - and even where the level of concern for the children is of<br/>\nthe highest quality. Good intentions cannot, by themselves, replace loving<br/>\nparents.  On the same TV program was a story about young people in sport and<br/>\nhow  their attitudes and psychosomatic faculties were focused into <br/>\nunhealthy and unrealistic expectations, because the sport became the sole<br/>\nprovider of esteem and acceptance and popularity.<br/>\nMuch like the value we place on �education� today, can warp the outlook of<br/>\nyoung minds because the more important aspects of life are de-emphasised or<br/>\neven disregarded, in favour of the nebulous virtue of a �good, high income�<br/>\njob. Suicide does not discriminate between different income levels. <br/>\nSaturation Education:<br/>\n I realise that it�s a good thing to equip our kids with lots of relevant<br/>\ninformation for their future, not only to help them learn about potential<br/>\ncareer areas, but also to help them learn about aspects of the big wild<br/>\nworld around us, what makes it tick, etc. But the forcing of this style of<br/>\ninformation acquisition seems to benefit only some, not all.  For some, this<br/>\nstyle becomes stressful, not just information overload, but overloading<br/>\ntheir personal unique areas of competency and understanding. It can be a<br/>\nmediocre experience - not punctuated with high and low spots of consuming<br/>\ninterest, but uniformly bland and therefore undigestible in its presented<br/>\nformat. Its like you�re trying to conquer a disease with a cocktail of<br/>\nantibiotics - not appreciating the synergy of some of the chemical<br/>\ningredients, nor the diverse range of strengths/weaknesses of the individual<br/>\nimmune systems - instead of tailoring the antibiotic to the specific<br/>\nindividual and the specific disease. <br/>\n\tTo me, a �love of learning� is first required before any learning strategy<br/>\ncan be effective - this love of learning, once activated, will show certain<br/>\ntendencies towards certain subjects of interest. Then we can use different<br/>\nstrategies to help the child to satisfy its desire to learn about that<br/>\ncertain subject. All of this will automatically involve the core tools of<br/>\nreading, writing, calculating - and, in the course of natural events, lead<br/>\nto other subjects of interest.<br/>\nAs an adult I just turn off when faced with any subjects relating to<br/>\n�economics�, or �accountancy�, or �statistics� - yet I still use a necessary<br/>\nmodicum of those subjects in my daily life - but I don�t need to be an<br/>\nexpert in them to live my life competently. As a window cleaner I don�t need<br/>\na lot of the information I was subjected to at school, but my general<br/>\nknowledge gained from personal interest in a number of subjects, helps me to<br/>\nsuccessfully �socialise� with my clientele while I clean their windows. (It<br/>\nslows down the dollar per hour rate too - but hey, life�s more than work,<br/>\nmore than money, more than economic rationalism - life�s about<br/>\nrelationships!) <br/>\nAs a science journalist I come across a whole spectrum of matters that<br/>\ninterest me - but I should be a failure because I�m not an academic! <br/>\nShouldn&#39;t I?   After all, school failed to make me an academic - so I<br/>\nshouldn�t even attempt to be a science journalist. No, not so. My love of,<br/>\nand interest in, a variety of science matters carries me through - I just<br/>\nask a lot more questions, and then, hopefully, try to write them down in a<br/>\nstyle that is understandable and even informative - without being academic. <br/>\n\tThat�s another point about our current schooling system�s educational<br/>\nstrategies - it�s more oriented towards the academically gifted ones. That�s<br/>\ngreat, if your gift is academics, or the logical/mathematical/linguistic<br/>\ntype of �intelligence� - but sad if your areas of intelligence are quite<br/>\ndifferent, e.g., musical, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily<br/>\nkinesthetic, etc. What I�m saying here is that it should be a case of <br/>\n�horses for courses� when it comes to learning strategies - note, I said<br/>\nlearning strategies, not teaching strategies - we need to consider both<br/>\naspects of the educational process here.<br/>\n\tLots of kids suffer, in various ways, from their inability to process the<br/>\ninformation fed to them in this one �saturation� strategy. They can react<br/>\nnegatively, or be the target for antisocial behaviour because they can be<br/>\nseen as dumb or weak, and other students, unable to fit in also, seem to<br/>\nwant to exercise control-freak behaviour over these �misfits� so that they<br/>\nthemselves can feel justified, or �cool�, in a system that has failed to<br/>\ncater for all types of learning requirements and speeds and <br/>\nvulnerabilities. <br/>\nDon�t the educational authorities realise the negative mental impact that<br/>\nthe words �dumb� or �below average� can have on a growing child, or<br/>\nunderstand  the impact of negative peer pressure, or the lack of <br/>\n�sensitivity towards sensitivities� that exists in the artificial construct<br/>\nof the schoolyard or even in the classroom itself. Don�t they understand<br/>\nthat not every child learns at the same rate, and to be promoted to the next<br/>\ngrade without having fully understood the current grade could be setting the<br/>\nchild up for �failure�.? <br/>\n(In the field of Human Resource Management it�s called the �Peter Principle�<br/>\n- promoted beyond your ability.)<br/>\nMakes you wonder doesn�t it?  If the educational authorities were truly<br/>\ninterested in the learning potential and the mental welfare of our children,<br/>\nthey would, themselves, take time out to learn about the real needs of<br/>\nchildren in this very complex and very dangerous society that we live in. A<br/>\ngood education is not the primary tool for survival in the modern world of<br/>\nvocational and avocational careers - but a good character and a love of<br/>\nlearning are certainly better foundations for a satisfying career to be<br/>\nbuilt upon. And these things are not part of the school system�s curriculum.<br/>\nConclusion:<br/>\nI think the challenge is for the bureaucrats to get off their �custodial<br/>\ncare� crusade and start to be a big help, rather than a �big stick�, to the<br/>\n�home schooling� community of Australia. The punitive aspects of the West<br/>\nAustralian 1997 School Education Bill clearly show that the mentality at the<br/>\ntop has to change - from authoritarian and �I know best�, to �hey, we�re all<br/>\nin this together, how can we help each other, what can we learn from each<br/>\nother�.  Parents have to let go of the apron strings when their children<br/>\ngrow into adulthood and are no longer their responsibility - why can�t the<br/>\n�custodial carers� realise that the education of other people�s children was<br/>\nnever their right or responsibility in the first place. <br/>\nWe don�t just need a home schooling board to oversee contentious issues that<br/>\ncan arise between the Ed Dept and home schoolers, we need a board of home<br/>\nschoolers and teachers and educational psychologists alike to sit down and<br/>\nnut out a better deal for our children - mentally, emotionally, and<br/>\neducationally. I�m sure such a think tank could come up with some very<br/>\nhelpful positive and creative ways where the Ed Dept could become a real<br/>\npositive force in the education of home schooling children, taking a<br/>\nproactive helpful role, rather than the current punitive harmful one that it<br/>\nseems to pursue. <br/>\nBut the development of character, and construction of a balanced emotional<br/>\noutlook, I believe, should be left to us parents. And while I welcome a<br/>\ngeneral societal concern for the wellbeing of all children, I don�t believe<br/>\nthat anyone but the parent has a �custodial� right or responsibility to<br/>\ntheir own children. <br/>\nA different style of learning, as in various �home schooling� strategies,<br/>\ndoes not necessarily put a child at moral risk - but maybe a school campus<br/>\nthat allows bullying (of various types),  drugs, anti-social behaviour,<br/>\nabuses of teachers (leading to lack of respect for authority in general),<br/>\nnegative peer pressure, and negative �pigeon-holing�, does.  It�s something<br/>\nthat all concerned parents and teachers need to think about.<br/>\n(PS - My  headmaster, at Double Bay Primary School in NSW, was one of the<br/>\nnicest and encouraging teachers I have ever met - he was a  real <br/>\n�grandfather� - under his tutelage I once got 298 out of 300 for arithmetic.<br/>\n[Other teachers didn�t have the same effect on me.]   So I hope by this<br/>\narticle that I don�t dishonour his profession or his love for his fellow man<br/>\nor his concern for the kids in his charge. Thanks, Mr Hoorigan!)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of article<br/>\nThese things ap[ply to our schooling system - but maybe some aspects apply<br/>\nto yours as well??<br/>\n<br/>\nGollumgregg - a lover of hobbits - especially purged, gutted, filleted and<br/>\nroasted over a slow fire.

Many people<br/>\nare so disconnected that they argue that we should not meddle in the<br/>\npolitics of other countries (Trekkies will relate this to the Star Fleet<br/>\nPrime Directive.)  But we obviously cannot ignore genocide like that.  I<br/>\nnever lost my perspective, as I can&#39;t get the stroy of one particular<br/>\nlittle boy out of my mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA similar situation can be equated to the School System.  Many parents do<br/>\nnot get involved because they have &quot;faith&quot; in the system (My parents are a<br/>\ncase in point.)  They are so enamored of the concept of public education<br/>\nfor all, that they sacrifice their children to the ideal.  On the other<br/>\nside of the fence we have the officials who do no want to get TOO involved<br/>\nwith our children ie: teaching them manners, values, sex education (not<br/>\nuntil too late anyway,) culture.  They consider these the domain of the<br/>\nfamily (and rightly so!) and they just want to stick to the scholastic<br/>\nfacts.  The problem is that there are so many parents who trust the school<br/>\nsystem to &quot;educate&quot; their children, and do not draw a line with pure<br/>\nscholastics.  The biggest argument to homeschooling around here is usually<br/>\n&quot;What about Socialization?&quot;  In other words, what about culture, manners,<br/>\nvalues, friendships, mentors..etc?  Is school really the place our children<br/>\nshould be getting these things from?  Even well intentioned parents who<br/>\nthink they are addressing these issues at home forget how many of them are<br/>\nsupplemented, or overridden completely, by the school environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have no control over the environment at school, and the children are<br/>\noften left mostly unsupervised, milling in large groups saying and doing<br/>\nwho knows what to each other.  In my opinion, most of these children are<br/>\nfar too young to be so loosely supervised or left to make their own moral<br/>\ndecisions and deal with peer stress and academic stress that even college<br/>\nstudents often have trouble handling.  In contrast to the loose supervision<br/>\non the playground, outside of school grounds, or even in assemblies and<br/>\nother forums at school, there is the classroom.  There small children are<br/>\nexpected to sit at desks most of the day and act like tiny office workers.<br/>\nKeeping their mouths shut, their butts in their chairs, doing what they are<br/>\ntold, not asking questions unless they are in the narrow current subject<br/>\nfield, NOT interperting assignments with creativity but performing as<br/>\ndirected, NOT rocking the boat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t even go to the bathroom or take care of their other immediate<br/>\nneeds.  Children with low blood sugar (like me, and my nephew) are left to<br/>\nstarve for hours between meals.  My neice with profound diabetes cannot<br/>\ncarry her own medication, although she knows how to do her own finger-prick<br/>\ntests and insulin injections with  a &quot;pen&quot; style injector that would not be<br/>\ndangerous for other children.  Instead, her father must leave work twice<br/>\nduring school hours every day to check her blood and administer insulin<br/>\nwhen necessary.  Her parents had to fight to get the school to allow her to<br/>\ncarry and eat glucose tabs and sugary snacks in her &quot;fanny pack&quot; for when<br/>\nshe was feeling &quot;Low.&quot;  How is that in our childrens best interest, when we<br/>\nmust fight to have their basic needs cared for, or tell our children they<br/>\nwill just have to &quot;Learn to wait&quot; or &quot;Hold it&quot; ??  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that public schools could make ENOUGH changes to make it a<br/>\nhealthy environment for children.  I just don&#39;t think that the system is<br/>\nemotionally, psychologically, or even physically healthy for our children,<br/>\nso why would we send them there?  Going to have to make another Star Trek<br/>\nreference (a what if utopia.)  Anyone seen how they handle &quot;school&quot;?

Sounds nice doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s enough for now, as their show it over.
