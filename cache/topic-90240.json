And I really want to take lessons!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and I were talking about it last night and I was explaining what <br/>\nlessons were:  I said that they teach you how to play songs.  He says &quot;But Mommy, I <br/>\nlike to play my own songs, I don&#39;t want to learn those guys&#39;.&quot;<br/>\nWhat an great comment from the 3 1/2 yr old!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for now we are in the market for a used & very cheap piano!  Hoping to <br/>\nfind one free if we move it....wish me luck!<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90235,"nextTopicId":90252}}
