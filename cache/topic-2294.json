I have a lot of respect <br/>\nfor any parent - it&#39;s not an easy job no matter how you slice it.  i <br/>\nsay &quot;job&quot; because no matter how much one enjoys it and savors every <br/>\nwonderful moment, it still involves a lot of work and responsibility <br/>\nto attain that level of enjoyment.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   and don&#39;t be so hard on yourself!  i&#39;m sure you are doing a lot <br/>\nbetter than you give yourself credit for!   <br/>\n<br/>\n  So<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to find someone categorically saying that they find life with<br/>\n&gt; toddlers wearing, and that it gets more fun is a real boost to me! <br/>\n&gt; Thanks!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  i have to agree with Jill.  although some of their toddler <br/>\nfrustrations are replaced by others as they get older, they do become <br/>\nmore fun.  i think maybe this happens right about the time they start <br/>\nbecoming a little &quot;person&quot; and discovering their &quot;self&quot; and having <br/>\ntheir own identity.  It becomes more fun when they can communicate <br/>\nand start asking lots of questions too.  although along with the <br/>\ncommunication skills, come the tools to learn how to be sassy!  <br/>\nso no... nothing&#39;s perfect!  &lt;G&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Tracy in UK (who will probably remain a lurker for a while<br/>\n&gt; longer...)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;Tracy@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"InANS5NtWeWskktktLKISVwBxo7jfGz2d-KhoE9CxcUZMPdMz5AAMCvqOLSdXOfzYL5EyU8ldoIdt8LLEbt29DBg8cdAOjhZHojLWW7i7RH_6qER4ZRJJ_XP","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 170","postDate":"935617395","msgId":2294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNzEuMjI5NC45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2307,"prevInTime":2293,"nextInTime":2295,"topicId":2294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... very ...
