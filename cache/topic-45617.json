Either their mothering instinct never kicks <br/>\nin, or they&#39;re more interested in going out than taking care of their child <br/>\nor something, but some women are not good moms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish every woman who ever wanted a child and was unable to have one (or <br/>\nanother one) could magically have had one and every woman who accidently got <br/>\npregnant could have NOT done so.  I wish every woman who ever had a baby to <br/>\nentrap a man or to get more welfare or to have another person to love her <br/>\nwould have had the simple positive regard and love it would have taken for <br/>\nher to be content without creating a life for her immediate selfish reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad I started sooner, I might have had more children.  We were undecided for <br/>\nyears about whether to have children or not, and Kirby was an oops, but we <br/>\nreally liked being parents.  I decided not to have any more after three <br/>\ncesareans and not to have any in my 40&#39;s.  I know people do it and live to go <br/>\nto graduations and marriages.  I chose not to risk it for various personal <br/>\nreasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo say it&#39;s not okay to blame Andrea Yates for being Christian is unfair in a <br/>\nconversation in which God&#39;s &quot;law&quot; is being invoked.  She homeschooled because <br/>\nshe was Christian, as I understand it--not from any belief about cognition or <br/>\nchild development.   I could be wrong, but if she had children and <br/>\nhomeschooled them because she was Christian then it&#39;s a Christianity issue, <br/>\nnot a homeschooling issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45362,"nextTopicId":45633}}
