He reads a lot, LOVES to watch Discovery, PBS and the TLC.<br/>\nHe only likes to play with his friends, &quot;Alex, DJ and Bookie&quot; when HE<br/>\nfeels like it. He takes social things in &quot;very small doses.&quot;<br/>\nIn the beginning they didn&#39;t understand this AT ALL. They came to the<br/>\ndoor and asked if he can play and he says &quot;no or yes.&quot;<br/>\nThey have come to terms with his different attitude and his talks about<br/>\nscience and the things he enjoys that his friends typically don&#39;t think<br/>\nabout.<br/>\nI have heard them say, &quot;Zechie is smart.&quot; They sort of think of him as a<br/>\nnovelty!<br/>\nMy son looks different too. He has very long hair, like an Indian. He<br/>\nchooses not to cut it and I&#39;m okay with it as long as it&#39;s neat when we<br/>\ngo somewhere. <br/>\nAs for grades; when asked &quot;What grade are you in.&quot; he says, &quot;What<br/>\nsubject are you referring to?&quot;<br/>\nHe also says, &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled and I&#39;m 9 years old I&#39;m not  in a<br/>\ngrade.&quot;<br/>\nThat ends that. <br/>\nMy girls deal with quite a bit of social pressure by the pre-teens and<br/>\nteens here, especially when it comes to clothing. But they are learning<br/>\nto be different and to accept the diversity! If anything, they are<br/>\nconfident in our lifestyle and see the lack of time that the<br/>\nneighborhood children have with their parents or their personal<br/>\ninterests.<br/>\n:O)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\n.· ´¨¨))  -:¦:-<br/>\n           ¸.·´ .·´¨¨))<br/>\n        ((¸¸.·´   .·´   -:¦:-Valerie Cifuentes<br/>\n      -:¦:-    ((¸¸.·´*<br/>\nI CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT FORWARDS, CHAIN LETTERS AND PETITIONS.
