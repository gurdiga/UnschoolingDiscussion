So yes, she was okay.<br/>\nI then finished up the paper, walked it to finish the meat up, and low and <br/>\nbehold<br/>\nKiere had added her idea of spices to the meat...<br/>\nA full canister of pepper, just heaping over the meat..<br/>\nI started laughing .... she didn&#39;t know why..<br/>\nHubby came in and said, &quot;I guess she is too young, huh, and need <br/>\nsupervised..&quot;<br/>\nWe laughed a good one!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy cooking and adventuring this week with your families!<br/>\n<br/>\nBj<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41390,"nextTopicId":41372}}
