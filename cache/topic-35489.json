I feel like I *should <br/>\nbe directing their learning but I see that they learn better when <br/>\nleft to their own devices. They have just discovered the joys of <br/>\nlegos. I always wanted to show them the pictures on the boxes and <br/>\nsay, &quot;See? Put this one here and the yellow one here and you&#39;ll have <br/>\na rocket!&quot; Naturally they couldn&#39;t care less, lol! When I finally <br/>\nstepped back and stayed out of their way they built things that I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t believe. UGH! I, too, hope I can learn to back off and let <br/>\nthem teach themselves. No advice here, just understanding.  :-)<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Non-Lessons WAS Re: math experience","postDate":"1019465121","msgId":35564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExOS4xMDViZGY2NS4yOWY1MjdhMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35489,"nextInTopic":35569,"prevInTime":35563,"nextInTime":35565,"topicId":35489,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/21/2002 12:21:45 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

My daughter (2) soon became curious, <br/>\nand had to come over to play with the plane.  She asked me to make a plane <br/>\nfor her, and handed me some of the felt from her, as she calls it &quot;Arts and <br/>\nCrabs Box.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went ahead and made a plane-looking thing for her out of the felt, and <br/>\nshe had a heck of an unsuccessful time trying to get the thing to fly the way <br/>\nher brother&#39;s plane was filing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo SHE went over to my work files and pulled out a manilla folder and folded <br/>\nit into a crude paper airplane all by herself.  Then she and my son just had <br/>\nfun throwing the darn things around for a while, before they decided that <br/>\nthey wanted to use their &quot;Wizzers&quot;  (Scissors) from the &quot;Arts and Crabs Box&quot; <br/>\nto see if they could make a plane that would go faster and further.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know.  Maybe they learned nothing from the whole episode.  But they <br/>\nwere having fun, and I was letting go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if I will be able to train myself to continue to do this as they <br/>\ngrow older, or if I am just able to do this at this point in time because <br/>\nthey are pre-school age and I think they need to have fun more than they need <br/>\nto learn how to add and subtract.
