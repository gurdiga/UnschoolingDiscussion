Now, I need your help.  I am recruiting<br/>\nindependent account managers for Schoolpop.  The ideal account manager is an<br/>\norganized stay-at-home mom or former teacher who is involved with local<br/>\nschools, wants work out of their home, set their own hours and make good<br/>\nmoney.  I thought you might know of someone in your area who would be just<br/>\nright.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchoolpop is going to be carrying Over and Above Kids Art of Learning<br/>\nProgram.  Schoolpop offers a hassle-free program for PTAs to raise money by<br/>\nselling name-brand educational products such as Leap Frog below retail price<br/>\nand with no inventory processing. I am on the lookout for community leaders<br/>\nto introduce and represent Schoolpop&#39;s offerings to schools and PTAs. An<br/>\nindependent account manager would set his/her own hours, earn money every<br/>\nsale made by the participating schools, receive an exclusive territory with<br/>\nno upfront costs and help make a difference in the community.   If you know<br/>\nof anyone who would be an ideal independent account manager, have them check<br/>\nout www.shop.schoolpop.com and then contact ME DIRECTLY at 252 361 5437 or<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susan@...\">susan@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Myers<br/>\nChairman and Founder<br/>\nOver and Above Kids, Inc.<br/>\n6052 Lansing Dr<br/>\nCharlotte NC 28270<br/>\n252 361 5437 cell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susan@...\">susan@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80018,"nextTopicId":80197}}
