When they&#39;ve stored enough of them, they can discern patterns <br/>\nand those patterns will eventually fall into place as phonics rules that <br/>\nthey&#39;ve internalized, not consciously memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou keep on posting about this as if you&#39;re not reading/understanding what <br/>\nothers are saying. Maybe you can sound out the words, but not fully <br/>\ncomprehend the meaning? (Take that as gently teasing and making a point at <br/>\nthe same time, okay? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one person has said that people don&#39;t use phonics to sound out words. You <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to prove that to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they have said is:<br/>\nChildren do not have to be systematically taught phonics in order to learn to <br/>\nread.<br/>\nThey can learn to sound out words in natural ways as they learn to recognize <br/>\nmany words and pick up the subtleties of various letter combinations, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nLOTS of kids learn that &quot;STOP&quot; means stop - because they see it on stopsigns <br/>\nall the time. It can be years later when they realize that the &quot;st&quot; blend <br/>\nmakes that certain sound in other words too. They might learn it very quickly <br/>\nbecause they might be interested - they might ask: &quot;But WHY does it sound <br/>\nlike S-T-O-P and parents may say, &quot;Well, the letter &quot;S&quot; often sounds like <br/>\nthat and the letter &quot;T&quot; often sounds like this and when they&#39;re together you <br/>\njust blend them like this and so on.... and the parent may even show them <br/>\nsome other words that also start with &quot;ST&quot; and they might fool with words <br/>\nwhile driving in the car - see if you can find any other words on billboards <br/>\nor signs that have &quot;ST&quot; together in them etc. And so the kid WILL learn <br/>\nphonics- but only because the KID has an interest and the parents are <br/>\nresponsive. OR the kid may come to realize ONLY after learning to read a <br/>\nwhole bunch of words that HAVE the &quot;st&quot; blend in them - at the beginning, <br/>\nmiddle, and ends of words that it always has that sound. Every kid is <br/>\ndifferent, every parent is different, every situation is different -- but the <br/>\none thing that is certain - it is not NECESSARY to teach kids phonics in <br/>\norder for them to learn to read. You just cannot argue that it is necessary, <br/>\nwhen faced with first-hand testimonials from many parents of children who <br/>\nweren&#39;t taught that way and learned to read just beautifully.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncouraging people to teach phonics to their kids will come across to most <br/>\npeople like their kid won&#39;t learn to read &quot;right&quot; unless the parent imposes a <br/>\nsystematic instructional phonics program on them. There is ENOUGH anxiety <br/>\nover the &quot;learning-to-read&quot; issue already. Kids WILL learn phonics - just <br/>\nlike they will learn lots of other things. Be responsive to your kids - <br/>\nanswer their questions, surround them with good reasons to read, read to them <br/>\na lot, listen to books on tape, use print materials to find out things they <br/>\nwant to know, notice written information on signs, ENJOY words, play with <br/>\nwords and letters and sounds as it comes up naturally. Play games that the <br/>\nkids enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don&#39;t endanger your child&#39;s potential ability to read pleasurably by <br/>\nimposing phonics lessons because you&#39;re afraid they won&#39;t learn to read <br/>\nwithout them. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Who is phonics for?","postDate":"1028311453","msgId":39672,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NzA0MTQ4LjExMjElbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjgyNjI3NTIuOTg1LjQ4NTYzLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39676,"prevInTime":39671,"nextInTime":39673,"topicId":39672,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Unschoolers and others, Phonics is for people of all ages who encounter a word that they have not seen before.
