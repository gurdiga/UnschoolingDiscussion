My 14yo dd understands unschooling and <br/>\nthe idea that whatever she&#39;s interested in, we pursue, blah, blah and <br/>\nshe is a different person than her 11yo sister in that she is a great <br/>\ncommunicator/verbal person.  When someone says something like math is <br/>\nhard, she would have a great response.  Or what about college, she <br/>\nwill say we&#39;ve checked into it and colleges still like me even though <br/>\nI&#39;m hs&#39;d.  The 11yo we pulled out because of the insecurity/phobia <br/>\nthe school/her peers were ingraining in her.  It was about reading <br/>\nthen.  Math has always been her strong suit in an abstract way, like <br/>\nher daddy.  The only thing I can do is continue to reinforce our new <br/>\nway of life and, with the help of family members, hope things turn <br/>\nout the way we predict they will.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, too, would certainly be happy to hear of stories from people who <br/>\nhave &#39;been there, done that&#39; and how it went.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95817,"nextTopicId":95720}}
