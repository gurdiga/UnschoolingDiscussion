We are ovo-lacto for the most part. The kids have tried different<br/>\nkinds of meat lately (because I told them it&#39;s their choice) but are both<br/>\nbasically sticking with the vegetarian diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use a lot of the meat substitutes out there like vegi-ground beef,<br/>\nvegi-chicken and chicken nuggets, vegi-hamburgers and hotdogs. Since my dh<br/>\nis not a vegetarian, he really enjoys when I use a typical &quot;meat&quot; recipe and<br/>\nalter it using vegi-products. It works for us. If you need any help<br/>\nconverting some of your favorite recipes to veggie, let me know and I can<br/>\nprobably help. Hey, I even make my own vegi-ribs. &lt;.g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple books I would recommend for you and your daughter are &quot;Pretend<br/>\nSoup&quot; and also &quot;Honest Pretzels&quot;, both by Mollie Katzen. They are kid<br/>\norientated with wonderful step-by-step directions and great illustrations,<br/>\nand are just plain fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, let me know if I can help in any way.
