In a discussion on the topic, I<br/>\n&gt; cleverly dangled from the<br/>\n&gt; wall with my husband&#39;s hand on my throat. My breasts<br/>\n&gt; were his, as well as<br/>\n&gt; all of my body. If I wanted to keep the Da** baby I<br/>\n&gt; would feed the F***er<br/>\n&gt; formula or let it starve. Then again, since I<br/>\n&gt; decided not to terminate the<br/>\n&gt; pregnancy to start, it was another item on his list<br/>\n&gt; of my faults. When I<br/>\n&gt; left, I felt that most of life was my fault, and I<br/>\n&gt; was to blame for anything<br/>\n&gt; that was bad. The cereal fell off a shelf at the<br/>\n&gt; store I worked for, and<br/>\n&gt; amongst tears, I was apologizing to my manager for<br/>\n&gt; it being my fault. He was<br/>\n&gt; more upset over it than I. Since it was my life, and<br/>\n&gt; his just happening to<br/>\n&gt; be there. Does that make sense?<br/>\n&gt; Stephanie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!
