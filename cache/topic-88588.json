But it isn&#39;t your obligation to justify your decisions to her. It isn&#39;t your obligation to educate her. Her hostile questioning -- eg, saying in various ways that you can&#39;t possibly be right -- is saying you do owe her an explanation because you&#39;re obviously not operating on all cylinders to care so little about your child.<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about this thread, and while I completely understand everyone&#39;s responses, I just wanted to leave open the possibility that this friend could come around to a more unschooling friendly perspective. I know it must get *really* old hearing the &quot;can&#39;ts&quot; but isn&#39;t that a necessary step in a way? <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when people are confronted with ideas that are so radically different from everything that society and their own experience tells them is *right,&quot; all they can see at first is the cant&#39;s. I was really open to unschooling from the beginning, but I still went through the whole &quot;but how do you...&quot; stage. And, chances are pretty good that I&#39;ll hit some more of those along the way, which is why I&#39;m grateful to have found a group of more experience unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a friend of mine first introduced TCS to me, I tried to keep a really open mind. I borrowed her book and read through it, listened to her, but I still could only see the exceptions. At this early stage, I could only see all the reasons why it wouldn&#39;t work or all the extreme cases where I wouldn&#39;t be able to apply it in my family. It wasn&#39;t that I was invalidating her choice or making myself feel better by thinking her choice was wrong. I simply could not make the leap without taking the time to completely think it through, and thankfully, she was patient with me. Each time I would run into her, I would ask her more questions about it, and instead of dismissing me, or drilling me into the ground, she would answer them. After a while, I found myself reading more about it on the internet and asking her how she dealt with specific dilemmas. She could tell that I&#39;d been reading and that my questions were now about specific concerns instead of wild exaggerations as to why it wouldn&#39;t work, and she went into even more detail about her difficulties--probably because I was no longer putting her on the defensive with my position. Hearing how she specifically handled her own concerns was very enlightening to me; it let me see that one didn&#39;t have to buy into TCS wholesale or live it perfectly. It let me see TCS more as goal for which we could strive than as a rigid philosophy, and that made it seem like a really useful tool to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while I don&#39;t think unschoolers should be out there proselytising or anything, maybe being positive and planting seeds is a better tact? Better for whom, I suppose would be the question. Better for the kids whose lives we might potentially improve rather than the mothers who are grilling us? As for anyone without children, well, to heck with them! &lt;eg&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought from someone who hasn&#39;t dealt with negative people for years and years and who remembers what it&#39;s like to be on the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13935,"nextTopicId":88915}}
