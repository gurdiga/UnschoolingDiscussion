I do remember the general idea of the<br/>\nstory, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The book was about a couple of kids who move into this old house with<br/>\nthe rest of their family.  In exploring the house they end up in the<br/>\nattic and meet this ghost cat named Ophelia.  She has lived in the house<br/>\nsince it was built a long time before.  The kids go up in the attic all<br/>\nthe time to hear the ghost cat tell them stories about the people who<br/>\nlived in the house over the years.  I think it was a pretty long book.  I<br/>\nremember feeling really grown up reading such a &quot;big&quot; book!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s all I remember!  Does this sound familiar to any of you?  I<br/>\nread this when I was about 9 or 10, and would really enjoy reading it<br/>\nagain, maybe to my kids someday.  It&#39;s kinda like having an itch I can&#39;t<br/>\nscratch, not knowing the title!!! LOL!!  Thanks in advance for your<br/>\nhelp!!!
