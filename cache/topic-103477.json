So, <br/>\nbesides the Live & Learn Conference, there&#39;s:<br/>\n   The Magic House, a neat, hands-on, fun science-oriented place <br/>\ngood for kids probably up to age 10 or so; <br/>\n  one of the best and most respected botanical gardens in the world; <br/>\n  a science museum (can&#39;t remember the name) that would suit kids <br/>\nmaybe 8 & older;<br/>\n  a place called Grant&#39;s Farm - free, you take a tram through the <br/>\nfarm where all sorts of animals roam around (it&#39;s sponsored by <br/>\nAnheiser Busch, so 1/2 way through, the tram stops at the petting <br/>\nzoo and the adults get free beer!! Yahoo!);<br/>\n  speaking of beer, there&#39;s the terrific tour of the Anheiser Busch <br/>\nbrewery, which really is interesting, and the stables where the <br/>\nclydesdales live in a manner to which we&#39;d all like to become <br/>\naccustomed!;<br/>\n  There&#39;s a good butterfly house w/ an antique carousel next door.<br/>\n  There&#39;s the St. Louis Zoo, which is located in a park where <br/>\nthere&#39;s also an art museum and plenty of paths for walking, biking, <br/>\nrollerblading, great place to throw a frisbee, etc. <br/>\n  Oh, and there&#39;s the Arch, right on the Mississippi River; and the <br/>\nCardinals, and the Rams, and ...there&#39;s lots more, but I sound like <br/>\nI&#39;m w/ the St. Louis tourist bureau.<br/>\n  I&#39;m looking forward to putting faces to names I see on this list.<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nJulie H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103492,"nextTopicId":103499}}
