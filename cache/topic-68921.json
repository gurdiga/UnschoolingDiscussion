With our oldest son, after years of disagreeing about a set bedtime, I have worn my husband down. Son one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1499537925\">Laura<br/>\nI have the same trouble but I can see progress. With our oldest son, after<br/>\nyears of disagreeing about a set bedtime, I have worn my husband down. Son<br/>\none (11 years old)  now turns his light out when he is ready - usually after<br/>\nhusband and I are asleep. He regulates himself having some really late<br/>\nnights and earlier ones other nights and although this does depend a lot on<br/>\nhow exciting the book is that he is reading, he is also more aware of his<br/>\nown body and how tired he is feeling. A strict &quot;lights out because I said<br/>\nso&quot; does not allow children to feel that because they are too busy crying<br/>\n&quot;unfair&quot;. But the freedom to do this means that he listens to me and takes<br/>\nnotice if I recommend an earlier night for any real reason. One day he had<br/>\nbeen feeling unwell earlier in the day and came to me after tea and asked<br/>\nwhat time I recommended he settle down for the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now my husband is stressing about our second son (8 years old). I<br/>\nusually go and check on him before I go to sleep and ask if he wants to be<br/>\ntucked in. Sometimes he does, sometimes he decides to put his own light out.<br/>\nBut if my husband decides &quot;its far too late, he&#39;s only eight years old, we<br/>\ncan&#39;t have him sleeping in till 9.00 am every morning...&quot; we end up with a<br/>\npower struggle  and a son who is determined to stay up as late as possible<br/>\nregardless of how he feels. Because we are flip-flopping between these two<br/>\napproaches, the son is very conscious of the time and trying to stay up as<br/>\nlate as he can. I am hoping that my husband will back off and leave it to me<br/>\nand honestly, he gets so stressed about it, he probably will.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 17<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 13 May 2003 15:44:31 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: No set bed time<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know we where on this subject a week or 3000 emails ago but I tried it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am getting some friction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I told Dustin he no longer had a bed time and he of  coarse thinks this is<br/>\n&gt; great!<br/>\n&gt; My husband after being annoyed that Dustin did not empty the dishwasher<br/>\n </span></blockquote>told<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; him to shut off his light.
