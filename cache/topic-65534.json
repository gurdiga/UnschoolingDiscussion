No matter what.  She&#39;s<br/>\ncome up with some rather interesting &quot;Even if...&quot; questions, and<br/>\nsometimes that becomes a game, but it&#39;s also very very serious.  With<br/>\nher recent query into belief systems (swim team locker room discussions<br/>\nwith a &quot;fundy&quot; teammate has triggered a rash of conversations!) plus our<br/>\ncurrent health issues (my cancer recurrence/current chemo & DH&#39;s<br/>\nupcoming major surgery), the &quot;stuck with me&quot; has expanded into<br/>\ndiscussing what will/may happen after death does separate us. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had some really amazing talks.  Yes, including running, suicide,<br/>\nmurder, going to jail, heaven/hell/reincarnation/etc, how would I<br/>\nfeel/what would I do if she died, she&#39;d like to live with Aunt P but<br/>\nAunt P&#39;s even older and what if she dies, wills & inheritance, oh my, on<br/>\nand on.  Addressing a lot of things, curiosity, security, laws, her<br/>\nsib&#39;s trials growing up (one legal name change at 18) and my own (my<br/>\nfather died when I was 4), what it takes (& means) to earn a living...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He tested us unbelievably,...my husband (ex-marine) finally looked<br/>\nhim straight in his eyes, after a major<br/>\nmeltdown on son&#39;s part, and said, &quot;get it all out, give us all you&#39;ve<br/>\ngot, but you&#39;re not going anywhere.  You&#39;re stuck with us.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed the original of this, but wanted to point out just on principle<br/>\nthat<br/>\nkids are NOT stuck.  They can run or they can kill themselves.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nknown<br/>\nkids who&#39;ve done both.  Trapping and holding them too hard isn&#39;t<br/>\nguaranteed<br/>\nto raise them to adulthood.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65064,"nextTopicId":65535}}
