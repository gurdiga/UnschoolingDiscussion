How long has Megan been unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nKatrina has almost no internet experience, but she is beginning to show some<br/>\ninterest.  One of the big results of being labeled in school was being<br/>\nisolated and often scapegoated, so she has real anxiety about other kids.<br/>\nWe have tried to artificially create situations where she could be<br/>\nsuccessful, but her anxiety is so overwhelming that these ended in failure,<br/>\ntoo.  I think it&#39;s possible that meeting others on the internet could really<br/>\nhelp.  I will help her get her an internet address of her own in the next<br/>\nweek, and please, if Megan could write her that would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Cathie _ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cathie_98@...\">cathie_98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; She also spent tons of time on the internet.
