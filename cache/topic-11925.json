I don&#39;t believe these wives tails about colds <br/>\nbut DH does. I just need to hear from someone else that they are not <br/>\ntrue.

In the Pacific <br/>\nNW here we treat cold and damp related illneses almost exclusively!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for discrimating between cold and allergies, the easiest way to tell is <br/>\nsimply length of time - does go on without getting worse/going deeper into <br/>\nthe body (lungs etc) and eventually fade away?  Or does it progress through <br/>\na bunch of symptoms over a week to 10 days and then you get better?<br/>\nHTH, though I can&#39;t support your thesis :P<br/>\nearthmoon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t believe these wives tails about colds<br/>\n&gt;but DH does.
