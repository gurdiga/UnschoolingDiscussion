That was really nice, and my kids (7, 5 and 4) were enjoying <br/>\n  running around with her two little girls, maybe 5 and 3 or 4 and 2. The <br/>\n  mom was telling me there were kids of all ages in the group, though they <br/>\n  didn&#39;t come during the day, of course, because they were in school. I <br/>\n  just smiled and nodded and thanked her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Once we were done exchanging info and that mom was trying to get herself <br/>\n  and her kids ready to go, I could hear her yelling at them in the hall <br/>\n  to sit still, I&#39;m-tired-of-this kind of stuff, etc. and I was thinking <br/>\n  to myself, &quot;no, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be joining those playgroups.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, Julia and I went to the bathroom while Sam and Em stayed in the <br/>\n  foyer with one of our LLL leaders, and when I got back, the MOM&#39;s group <br/>\n  mother was looking at Emily, saying &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what you mean&quot; <br/>\n  with a puzzled look on her face. I said something like oh, what did she <br/>\n  say kind of thing, and the lady said, &quot;She said that you don&#39;t ground.&quot; <br/>\n  I just laughed and said, &quot;No, we don&#39;t punish,&quot; leaving the astonished <br/>\n  woman in my wake as I went to retrieve the rest of our stuff from the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The other LLL leader followed me in and related that the MOMs group <br/>\n  woman was yelling at her daughters and telling them not to move from <br/>\n  their chairs or get up again, so Emily walked over and very politely <br/>\n  complimented the woman on her jacket, told her that her mommy had the <br/>\n  same jacket, but that her mommy didn&#39;t ground her kids.  *roflmao*  The <br/>\n  other leader and I were laughing so hard (quietly); she was just <br/>\n  cracking up that Em first did the whole fashion comment and then segued <br/>\n  into the whole punishment thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Em&#39;s concept of getting in trouble is when either dh or I are unhappy <br/>\n  with one of them and maybe speak sharply, but she&#39;s getting the idea <br/>\n  that other parents out there &quot;ground&quot; and punish their kids, including <br/>\n  spanking, much of this from cartoons and such. Two neighborhood girls <br/>\n  (11 and 9) have also told her all about grounding, to which Em <br/>\n  supposedly responded, &quot;Well, my mom doesn&#39;t ground.&quot;  The girls told her <br/>\n  that&#39;s because she was still young and that I would start soon! She and <br/>\n  I had a long talk about that one and why they might tell her such a <br/>\n  thing. *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n  --Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;  <br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
