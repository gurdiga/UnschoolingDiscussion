So we decided we were more comfortable<br/>\nwith no vaccinating.

We only did the ones we deemed as <br/>\nnecessary but then we enrolled him in preschool and had to do the <br/>\nwhole series.  I was not happy and should have filed for a religious <br/>\nexemption even though we are not with any church.  I heard later it <br/>\nwas really easy to do so that was my fauly for not checking into it <br/>\nfurther.  My second has had one round of polio and DTP.  I may or <br/>\nmay not do the boosters on those but have not decided.  He is not <br/>\ngoing to school so I have no schedule for myself.  The only one I <br/>\nmay do is the tetnus because when my older son got stitches recently <br/>\nafter falling on glass they *required* it.  I was happy he already <br/>\nhad it since one more shot of anything may have put him over the <br/>\nedge!!  I have heard if you do MMR you should do them as 3 seperate <br/>\nshots, not one which has been one factor that has been pointed to as <br/>\na cause for autism.  My DR. gave me articles to disprove the theory <br/>\nand although I agree it is most likely not the case, I would not bet <br/>\nmy child&#39;s health on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, any health &quot;initiative&quot; that is linked with BIG time money is <br/>\nhard for me to have faith in.

Come on, for the few cases who are serious I <br/>\nam sure there are just as many reactions.  But drug companies have a <br/>\nmassive interest.  Can you imagine the amount of money earned for <br/>\nevery vaccine that is made mandatory.  I find it scary.  I also find <br/>\nit scary that people just blindly follow their doctors and never <br/>\nquestion anything.

He got the first <br/>\nround of DPT at 2 months.  His leg got hot, and a knot came there, <br/>\nand he cried and screamed for hours.  After getting the shot, a mole <br/>\nstarted to grow at the place where the shot was given.  When I asked <br/>\ndoctors about it later, they said it could have nothing to do with <br/>\nthe shot.  But my baby did NOT have that mole there at birth, it only <br/>\ncame there after receiving the shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he got the MMR at 12 months.  Shortly thereafter, he broke out <br/>\nwith red spots.  I took him to the emergency room.  They said it was <br/>\nnot unusual for some children to catch the disease from the shot.  So <br/>\nwhat was the point of the shot, then?  The point was to keep them <br/>\nfrom getting the disease, and he got it anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that time I read &quot;DPT - A Shot in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Immunizations:  <br/>\nTheory vs. Reality&quot; and learned the that whole theory behind why <br/>\nimmunizatons are supposed to work is a flawed theory.  Studies have <br/>\nshown that the shots do not confer the true immunity that they are <br/>\nsupposed to confer. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I object to many of the additives put into the shots, which I <br/>\nbelieve are harmful, such as aluminum, thimerisol (mercury) and <br/>\nformaldehyde.  Formaldehyde polimerizes living tissue.  Also, some of <br/>\nthe growth mediums used to grow the cultures are just gross.  &quot;To <br/>\nmake a live vaccine, the live virus must be attenuated, or weakened <br/>\nfor human use.  This is accomplished by serial passage - passing the <br/>\nvirus through animal tissue several times to reduce its potency.  For <br/>\nexample, measles virus is passed through chick embryos, polio virus <br/>\nthrough monkey kidneys, and the rubella virus through human diploid <br/>\ncells - the dissected organs of an aborted fetus!&quot;  (quote from <br/>\nImmunization:  Theory vs. Reality).  So since the virus passes <br/>\nthrough animal tissue, it picks up animal RNA and DNA and this goes <br/>\ninto your child as well.  Who knows whether some of the reactions <br/>\nchildren have to the shot is simply a reaction to the foreign animal <br/>\ngenetic material placed into their blood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the body is strengthened after the true disease has run it&#39;s <br/>\ncourse, and immunity has been conferred, but after taking the shots, <br/>\nthe body is not strengthened, it is compromised.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn nature, you are probably only going to catch one disease at a <br/>\ntime, maybe two.  You immune system can handle this.  When they give <br/>\nthese shots, they give three, four or five combinations at once.  It <br/>\nis very hard on the immune system to be bombarded with three to five <br/>\ndifferent diseases at the same time which it must fight off.  In <br/>\nnature, you would not catch that many diseases at once.  So this is <br/>\nan unnatural condition.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, most of the childhood diseases which killed so many can now be <br/>\nsuccessfully treated with antibiotics, they are not the threat they <br/>\nonce were.  The shots are more of a threat than the actual disease, <br/>\nin my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis are just a few of the reason we chose not to take the shots.  <br/>\nAlong with the fact that, we do not take kindly to being told that we <br/>\nHAVE to do anything, no matter what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157270430,"authorName":"Barbara Chase","from":"Barbara Chase &lt;barb@...&gt;","profile":"bc_avn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Now question about immunizations","postDate":"1063953561","msgId":80889,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNTIwMGYwOWJiOTA1Mjc0OTk5Y0BbMjA0LjE4OS4xMS40MV0+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2LjNlM2FlN2NhLjJjOWJmMDBhQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQ2LjNlM2FlN2NhLjJjOWJmMDBhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":80886,"nextInTopic":80898,"prevInTime":80888,"nextInTime":80890,"topicId":80886,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Nancy, My dd had tetanus when she was little, and I only gave her 1 booster (I think 3 or 4 are recommended.)

She was adequately covered for the incident, and really didn&#39;t<br/>\nneed anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your case, I would say it really does depend on how old your kids are<br/>\nand what vaccines you are talking about.  There are some vaccines I may end<br/>\nup doing for my dd if she doesn&#39;t get the illness by the time she is a<br/>\nteen, but we will see.  It&#39;s been awhile, so my mind doesn&#39;t really have<br/>\nthe facts... but I do remember when I was doing the research I decided that<br/>\nif I had a boy I would most certainly consider the vaccine once he became a<br/>\nteen/young adult.  Of course, by then the child is helping to make the<br/>\ndecision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"echomygecko","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[UnschoolingDiscussion] Was Re: More clarifying.Now question about immunizations","postDate":"1063949834","msgId":80886,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2LjNlM2FlN2NhLjJjOWJmMDBhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":80889,"prevInTime":80885,"nextInTime":80887,"topicId":80886,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a question about immunizations.

Some of you may remember past <br/>\ndiscussions about this, my stance has always been that it is a necessary thing because <br/>\nthat is what I was always taught; in nursing school and before that from <br/>\nliving in third world countries growing up. But, throughout the years, reading <br/>\nhere and elsewhere, I have now decided that it isn&#39;t something I want for my kids <br/>\nanymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, we got a postcard from the kids pediatrician reminding that <br/>\nboth are due for annual check ups and that Jack still hasn&#39;t had his last round <br/>\nof childhood immunizations and that Moly is due for a booster. (I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember which one and I&#39;m not going to the fridge to look. &lt;g&gt;) This evening, Darin <br/>\nnoticed the card and asked me why Jack hasn&#39;t yet gotten his last shots and I <br/>\ntold him I didn&#39;t think I was going to have Jack go through with the rest. He <br/>\nwas kind of upset, but mostly wondering why. I explained my change of ideals <br/>\nand we talked about this and other things like circumcision, and he said he <br/>\nwould think about it. He asked if, as we plan, we have another child, will this <br/>\nchild be circumcised if it is a boy and if I plan on going through the <br/>\nimmunization series and I said that no I did not plan on doing either. Darin thinks I <br/>\nreally should have Jack finish the series and get the booster for Moly. I was <br/>\nhoping that those of you (especially those who vaccinated some of your kids <br/>\nand not others) would share some more on why you chose not to and why you did <br/>\none child (or children) but not others. Thanks! <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has talent.
