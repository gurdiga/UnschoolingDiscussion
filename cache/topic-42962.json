I like rules, too.  They make me feel in control.  Hang<br/>\naround here too long, though, and you start understanding that the whole<br/>\npoint is giving your kids control.  Many of my rules are gone these days.  I<br/>\nmiss a couple of them, but we&#39;re much better off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want your children to choose stuff other than TV, offer other good<br/>\noptions.  Take trips, get out the craft supplies, see if anybody will play a<br/>\ngame with you.  But also expect that children need down time, too.  My son<br/>\nprefers not to watch TV, but there are days I&#39;d love to throw the gameboy<br/>\nout (even though it&#39;s wonderful for so many other reasons...).  But some<br/>\ndays he wants nothing more than that.  Gotta be a reason for it.
