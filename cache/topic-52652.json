He was really frustrated.  I asked him if he <br/>\n&gt; wanted the <br/>\n&gt; worksheet, and he said no.  So I took it and crumpled it up and I <br/>\n&gt; said &quot;this <br/>\n&gt; worksheet means nothing. You never have to do them if you don&#39;t want <br/>\n&gt; to, <br/>\n&gt; ever.  It&#39;s simply a way for an uncreative teacher to make herself <br/>\n&gt; think <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s getting through to you some way.  Did you learn anything about <br/>\n&gt; what she <br/>\n&gt; was saying?&quot;  yes.  &quot;Then you don&#39;t need a worksheet to tell you <br/>\n&gt; that.  Do <br/>\n&gt; you want to go back to the older class next time?&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;No.  They don&#39;t do anything fun.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, I insulted the teacher, and in the midst of a whole bunch of <br/>\n&gt; other <br/>\n&gt; homeschool moms milling about, too.
