If cleaning is advisable, here are some steps to<br/>\n&gt; follow. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Consult a coin dealer or other coin expert to assist you in deciding whether<br/>\n&gt; cleaning a particular coin is a good idea. When in doubt, do not clean the<br/>\n&gt; coin at all. If you decide to clean a coin, first try out any coin cleaning<br/>\n&gt; method on a cheap coin to see the results.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Always use non-abrasive cleaners such as rubbing alcohol or olive oil to clean<br/>\n&gt; coins. Commercial jewelry and metal polishes are usually too harsh. Rinse the<br/>\n&gt; coins with distilled water after cleaning. Tap water should not be used as it<br/>\n&gt; contains minerals which may create spots. Tarnished coins should only be<br/>\n&gt; cleaned (if at all) by a professional using a process known as &quot;dripping&quot;. Let<br/>\n&gt; coins air-dry after cleaning - never rub a coin dry.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Soaking in olive oil or mild soapy water can often safely remove dirt or other<br/>\n&gt; substances adhering to a coin. Specially made commercial coin cleaners are<br/>\n&gt; available at most coin supply shops but tend to be rather expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] cleaning pennies -- was being imperious, and deat...","postDate":"1090815684","msgId":96879,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MC4yZjIwOWIyMi4yZTM1ZTBjNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96883,"prevInTime":96878,"nextInTime":96880,"topicId":96879,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/25/2004 10:55:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
