I&#39;m SO glad this is back in print. You can all \r<br/>\nget one and you won&#39;t need this list anymore at all! (well maybe \r<br/>\nsometimes...)\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n========\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWhen we took over the John Holt bookstore, we never thought we would have\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nthe chance to carry a new book by John Holt (who died in 1985). Okay, it&#39;s\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nnot a &quot;completely&quot; new book, but it is largely new. Long out of print (with\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nused copies often going for much more than the original purchase price!),\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nthe classic &quot;Teach Your Own: A Hopeful Path to Education&quot; has now been\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nupdated and re-released.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThe new version is entitled &quot;Teach Your Own - The John Holt Book of\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nHomeschooling.&quot; Appropriately enough, it has been updated and edited by\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nPatrick Farenga, the president of Holt Associates. Pat has combined personal\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nstories and the resources from his own book, &quot;The Beginners Guide to\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nHomeschooling,&quot; with this classic work by the father of the modern\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nhomeschooling movement. The original was published in 1981 and was the\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nsource of inspiration for many parents considering homeschooling. Holt&#39;s\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nwords are every bit as inspiring today and show a timeless common-sense that\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nwill have nodding your head in agreement as you read along.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThis book will help you avoid the trap of turning your home into a miniature\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nschool. Instead, you will be encouraged to take advantage of the flexibility\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nhomeschooling offers you to provide an educational experience that is nearly\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nimpossible to duplicate in schools. If you are already homeschooling but\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nhave ever had moments of self-doubt, or wondered how to face relatives who\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nquestion your decision, then this book will restore your confidence and\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nremind you of the many benefits of the path you have chosen. If you are just\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\ngetting started or only considering homeschooling, then this book will help\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nopen your eyes about the many possibilities and will supply you with a\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nwealth of information and resources to help you on your way.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nLegal advice and suggestions for countering common objections to\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nhomeschooling are included. An extensive bibliography and several appendices\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nwill provide you with information on other books, correspondence programs,\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\ncurriculum suppliers, helpful private schools, homeschooling organizations,\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nlearning materials, and opportunities and activities. This is a &quot;must have&quot;\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nbook for every homeschooler!\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nList price is $18.00, but for a limited time is available from FUN Books for\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n$12.50.
