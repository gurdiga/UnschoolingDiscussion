If you live in the<br/>\nmiddle of PA where every other person has a gun rack on the back of his or<br/>\nher truck and you routinely allow your 4 yo child to play unsupervised at<br/>\nother people&#39;s homes is it common sense *not* to think that there&#39;s a<br/>\npossibility of him running into a gun just become someone you don&#39;t know<br/>\nnever suggested that possibility? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne lesson to be learned from Sleeping Beauty is that you cannot hide all the <br/>\nspindles in the world.  Had the princess in that story been warned, and <br/>\ntaught to use a spindle safely, and maybe warned to just stay away from them <br/>\nwhen she was sixteen, just in case, it would have been MUCH better than <br/>\nattempting to destroy them all.  Because all it took was one, and her total <br/>\nignorance, fascination and curiosity did her and her whole family in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re in a state or city with NO gunracks, strict gun laws, kid never <br/>\nlikely to see one, that might be an even more dangerous scenario than one <br/>\nlike New Mexico where guns are common, and even toddlers know they&#39;re not <br/>\ntoys, not to play with.  But the same way we DID give our kids toy saws and <br/>\ntoy hammers and toy drills, they had toy guns and water guns (REAL water <br/>\nguns, as they really shoot water), and none of them ever even had the urge <br/>\nfor a BB gun because they weren&#39;t exotic desireables.  They were just common <br/>\ntools.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have one rifle here.  My dad had a gun collection and I turned down taking <br/>\none.  I wish now I had.

He had been told emphatically to do what the <br/>\npriest told him.  He had been told repeatedly, at home and at school, to do <br/>\nwhat grownups say, ESPECIALLY priests and nuns and your mom and dad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen parents are unwilling to talk about issues as they come up, to prepare <br/>\nkids (in kid terms, not gory detail and horrible warnings) to make decisions <br/>\nand use their own judgment and to know where to go for help, the parents are <br/>\nliterally turning them over to abuse and danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37326,"nextTopicId":37334}}
