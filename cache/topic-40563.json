I made my list of books Moly likes earlier. I asked <br/>\nher if she would suggest anything else. She said she loves all her books on <br/>\ntape. I forgot about those!!! Many kids don&#39;t like to read, or don&#39;t read <br/>\nwell enough to like it. Books on tape are great. The book is read to you, <br/>\nwhile you follow along (or don&#39;t) this is a great help for wanting to read a <br/>\nbook of interest, that might be beyond the ability. Along this vein, turn on <br/>\nthe closed captioning option (if you have it) on your TV. We turned it on a <br/>\nfew years ago, and the kids (seem to) benefit from it. I also recommend some <br/>\nmagazines. Cobblestone publishing puts out some great kids magazines. Moly <br/>\ngets Spider, and the new science mag, ASK. Both kids get Highlights as a gift <br/>\nsub. from my Mom. Both Moly and Jack love their gaming magazines as well. And <br/>\nwe have had a request for the kids version of National Geographic. I had that <br/>\none when I was a kid, I hope they still publish it.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] read your funnies!","postDate":"1028972932","msgId":40563,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5N0ExOTExLkZGRSVhYnRsZW9AZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjg5MTc1OTUuOTkwLjQ1MjM1Lm0xMUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40565,"prevInTime":40562,"nextInTime":40564,"topicId":40563,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 8/9/02 20:26, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at ...
