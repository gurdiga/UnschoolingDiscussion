My son knows the sound of every single letter, and<br/>\nhe recognizes by sight every single letter, and he simply doesn&#39;t<br/>\nread.  So much for that theory.<br/>\n*********************************8<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter does the same thing!  She will be seven mid-may and is able to <br/>\nread most of the first set of Bob Books.  She is aching to read.  She is my <br/>\nchild that wakes up everyday begging to do &quot;school work&quot;.  She&#39;s never once <br/>\nbeen to school but she loves the concept, so we end up playing *school* <br/>\neveryday.  She *wants* to sit and do work from a book and drools everytime <br/>\nwe go to the local homeshool book store.  She asks for every set of flash <br/>\ncards, workbooks, kits, etc.  But she still isn&#39;t reading much.  She <br/>\nstruggles with hearing where sounds come in words...what is the middle sound <br/>\nin cat...she will say c-c-c-c-cat...C!!!  We&#39;ve done every game possible <br/>\nwith sequencing, first, middle, last, etc. but it doesn&#39;t stick.  She can go <br/>\nletter by letter and name every letter and offer it&#39;s sound but when she <br/>\nsees them all together, she stammers.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe talked at a pretty normal age so  don&#39;t think there is any correlation <br/>\nthere, but this child is very math/science oriented.  The concepts needed <br/>\nfor reading just haven&#39;t begun to stick yet.  (Although she can read every <br/>\nword when needing to navigate PS2 games! &gt;bg&lt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my point is that phonics isn&#39;t the straight arrow to reading, just <br/>\nas whole language (sight reading) won&#39;t make a good reader either.  (My <br/>\noldest was taught using the whole language method in ps and struggled <br/>\nbeginning in third grade when BIG words came into the picture.)  Kids need <br/>\nboth and will generally seek out each in order to read on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
