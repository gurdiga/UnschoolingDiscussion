I went to your web site, looked at the photos and read your first journal entries.  It looks great!  I look forward to following your journey!  I have<br/>\nhomeschooled my children for six years, but just started &quot;officially&quot; unschooling this year.  Before that it was more of a buy the curriculum, use it very<br/>\ntraditionally for about a week, and then gradually lose interest.  Now, I feel a little less guilty and have a better handle on how to guide the children with their<br/>\ninterests.  I really don&#39;t talk about &quot;unschooling&quot; to most of my homeschooling friends though, they would think I was crazy!<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings,<br/>\nerin<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is 1 message in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Topics in today&#39;s digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;       1.

She&#39;s so far ahead of their ps kids that they don&#39;t say anything about<br/>\nthe &quot;un&quot; part of the schooling process.  She taught herself to spell at<br/>\nabout 4 or 5 using Wheel of Fortune (and folks say there isn&#39;t anything<br/>\ngood about television &lt;g&gt;).  She is 7 now and has studied all kinds of<br/>\nthings that interest her including anatomy (flanges are her favorite bone<br/>\nbecause of the sound of the word &lt;g&gt;)!  She loves money so is teaching<br/>\nherself double and triple digit adding and subtracting.
