They make a<br/>\nwhole line of household products, we also use their toilet paper<br/>\n(non-chlorine bleached, recycled) and other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir website is http://www/seventhgen.com  and you can get a free copy of<br/>\n&quot;The Seventh Generation Guide to a Toxic Free Home&quot; at the site.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor dishwashing detergent, I&#39;ve also heard that you can mix Baking Soda and<br/>\nBorax in equal parts.
