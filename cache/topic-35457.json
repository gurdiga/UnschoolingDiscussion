Do you hold a position that I am not aware of on this list that<br/>\nmakes<br/>\nit necessary for you to decide who has the right to say what and what is<br/>\nor<br/>\nis not allowed to be said?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI thank God for the folks who were bold enough to tell me &quot;that&#39;s not<br/>\nunschooling&quot;!  For unschooling to work there has to be a leap of faith<br/>\nand it&#39;s all about trusting your child/ren to learn.  When I first<br/>\nstudied unschooling my gut told me it was true but I clung to my &quot;school&quot;<br/>\nmentality.  Until I let go completely I didn&#39;t see it work, since I did I<br/>\nknow that I know it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks, like Sandra, who held up the standard in spite of the torpedos<br/>\ngave me a vision to focus on.  I could have wasted time with lashing out<br/>\n(I probably did) but listening and being slow to defend myself got me<br/>\nmuch further.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch time and opportunity is wasted by multiple posts which attack<br/>\nresponding posters.  There will always be the faithful few who don&#39;t<br/>\ncompromise and are willing to stick their necks out.
