The violent, emotional<br/>\ndisturbances and the way everyone who was looking in on the situation<br/>\nnearly drove many of us in the family to want to kill ourselves. It was<br/>\nawful. At first when he was diagnosed  with bi polar I thought &quot;great&quot; I<br/>\nfinally know what the &quot;label&quot; is. Then the heavy drugs took him over and<br/>\nhe was what he had feared the most a walking zombie. Then time went by.<br/>\nWe stopped giving him drugs and gave him a nutritional supplement for<br/>\npeople with bi polar. I took him out of public school and began<br/>\nunschooling. His anger/depression decreased greatly. I have been<br/>\nthinking again lately about a society that for the most part doesnt want<br/>\nto hear about the things that anger children/teens. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why the medical and educational institutions just want to suppress symptoms and hide the *difficulties*. The truth is that do not know how to deal with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It is too easy in<br/>\nmy opinion, to label teens bipolar, pigeon hole them, and &quot;put them<br/>\naway.&quot; It&#39;s a &quot;fix.&quot; Another teen we know has just been labeled bipolar<br/>\nby this same doctor and is taking lithium. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree. This society wants quick fixes for everything, from a headache to a social rebellion. The problem is, most people believe there are quick fixes for everything, and avoid looking further for other, more humane alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I know kids are angry. If people don&#39;t listen<br/>\nit gets worse because they want to be heard, cared about, etc. Just<br/>\nabout every child, teen and young adult we know is on depression/anxiety<br/>\nmedication. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s more and more. It is very sad indeed...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think it should be looked at in the<br/>\nopposite way. School enables emotional disabilities in children.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you, but school is just a piece of the puzzle, I believe, although a pretty vital piece. The whole world is extremely unfriendly to children and young adults. And adults just keep repeating a pattern of domination-submission over and over. Perhaps if parents became more concious of their own shortcomings and disrespectful attitudes toward their children, they would start opposing the same in other places. Let&#39;s just hope...<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

Because - to say it lightly- s/he is not looking for <br/>\n&gt;his/her own identity as an individual and cannot embrace life completely <br/>\n&gt;without it.**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yol,  would you, or others, want to expound on this more,  fits lots of people I know,  don&#39;t necessarily feel very close to them, but it seems very main stream,   I don&#39;t know maybe its just conservatism/comformism??<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote> From my point of view, mainstream = suppression. Mainstream medicine = <br/>\nsuppression of physical symptoms; mainstream psychiatry = suppression of <br/>\nmental symptoms; mainstream schooling = suppression of interests and <br/>\nchoices; mainstream parenting = suppression of natural expressions and <br/>\nrights; and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n From a homepathic poit of view, when the natural expressions of things <br/>\nare denied and suppressed, the disease process starts. If it gets <br/>\nsuppressed more and more, then it becomes more degenerative and <br/>\nself-destructive for generations to come. Look at mainstream society: <br/>\ndoes it look healthy to you? This is why homeopathy looks at what the <br/>\nperson is expressing (verbally, mentally, physically, etc.) and goes <br/>\nfrom there. The aim is not to suppress more, but to remove suppression <br/>\nfrom generations past.<br/>\n<br/>\n From this point of view, if a teenager is too proper and subservient <br/>\n--notice I say *too*-- it means that somewhere along the way s/he got <br/>\nstuck in a certain behavioral pattern. It&#39;s the same thing if someone is <br/>\nalways angry, continuously fearsome, *too* rigid in his or her ideas, <br/>\npromiscuous, cruel, etc. Even though it may seem just &quot;the way to be&quot; <br/>\nwithin a certain societal context or community, it is not a natural <br/>\nexpression. We cannot be happy without being flexible and respecting our <br/>\ninner feelings and needs, and being at peace with others. And even <br/>\nthough we may not be aware of those things, our bodies let us know that <br/>\nthere is something wrong, that somewhere  in there there is suffering <br/>\nand pain. A lot of the times that suffering manifests in physical form, <br/>\nbut it can also become evident on a mental level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why IMO it&#39;s SO important to let our children be who they are and <br/>\nexpress themselves freely (and as a homeopath I would include here the <br/>\nexpression of fevers, rashes, fears, cravings, etc.); to raise them <br/>\nknowing that they have the right to be heard and understood. But we&#39;d <br/>\nstill have to deal with the suppression of generations past, and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhy kids come to this world with all sorts of weaknesses and tendencies <br/>\nthat have nothing to do with parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat homeopathy does is freeing the channels of expression, so to speak. <br/>\nTherapy does the same, but it usually takes much longer (it&#39;s agreat <br/>\ntool, though)...  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This seems to really lead me back to why we are unschooling;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In an unschooling life, my children won&#39;t ever have to feel pressure to be a &#39;certain&#39; way,  they can develop their true selves and feel good about it.  They will see the value in their individuality and learn to nurture it and make the most of it.  If they are different than me, I will embrace it.   They will be able to make their own choices and really know who they are.  And last but not least, I will also be able to learn who I am.  What an amazing journey! <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, free spirits... Homeopathy promotes that as well, on the physical, <br/>\nmental and emotional levels. It *facilitates* the process of inner <br/>\nhealing, and moves aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
