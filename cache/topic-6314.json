To answer your question Beth, I am still doing occassional<br/>\nprojects (and keeping my website, etc.).  I go for months when I&#39;m working<br/>\non very little, I get restless and I do a small project that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrequire too much time away from home. Having a pre-schooler, as you know,<br/>\nmakes outside projects challenging, and maybe more so when you have a very<br/>\nseparation sensitive little girl like mine.  Most of the time I bring her<br/>\nwith me, she does quite well at meetings, ballet classes, rehearsals.  We<br/>\nare thinking about having another baby and I probably won&#39;t do anything<br/>\nfor a long time after the second one is born.  I love my work and I&#39;m in<br/>\nthe position of getting to choose my projects (which is a blessing and a<br/>\ncurse!).  Right now I have a 12 week project, which means rehearsing 6<br/>\nhours a week (3 hours a day for 2 days) and then I probably won&#39;t do<br/>\nanything for at least 6 months.  We&#39;re very involved with La Leche League,<br/>\nan organization I credit with helping me to become an attached mother (and<br/>\nled me down this *dangerous* path into homeschooling and into<br/>\nun-schooling!!)  I&#39;m just worried I won&#39;t EVER get back to the work I<br/>\nlove...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for &quot;listening&quot;<br/>\nWini<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________<br/>\nWINIFRED HAUN & DANCERS<br/>\n4225 N.
