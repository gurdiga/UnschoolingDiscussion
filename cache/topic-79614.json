Quinn is most interested in the most exotic wildlife: pandas,<br/>\nplatypuses, Saharan fennec foxes. There&#39;s only so much that can be done IRL.<br/>\nI&#39;m contemplating getting cable just for Animal Planet (I DON&quot;T mean that&#39;s<br/>\nall we&#39;ll watch - I just mean that alone might make it worth the money). I<br/>\nthink the zoos have intern opportunities for when the kids are older. Quinn<br/>\nvolunteers at an ecology center where they have a lot of domestic animals<br/>\nthat he takes care of, that helps some.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not much help, but all we can really do is keep our eyes peeled for<br/>\nevery animal opportunity that arises. Oh, yeah, and we&#39;re trying to save and<br/>\nplan for a trip to Australia. Even the dream of that is satisfying in a<br/>\nsmall way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79569,"nextTopicId":79542}}
