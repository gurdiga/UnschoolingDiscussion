She didn&#39;t want to be part of it.  <br/>\n I later found out that she had seen in the directors office that he had several candles around and liked to burn them!

We have read and heard countless testimonies of what these items<br/>\n&gt; can do. Dolls levitate, walk and talk; owls caused cancer and when destroyed<br/>\n&gt; the person was totally healed. Please pray and seek the Lord regarding which<br/>\n&gt; items you must destroy. With pictures of movie stars you form a soul tie. One<br/>\n&gt; example is of a woman who came to us for DELIVERANCE from men and drugs. As I<br/>\n&gt; was praying for her the Lord impressed that the picture of Marilyn Monroe that<br/>\n&gt; was hanging above her bed was part of the problem.
