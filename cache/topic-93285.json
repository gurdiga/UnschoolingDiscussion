It&#39;s a messy journey in which everyone disappoints <br/>\nthemselves and others, yet they each find ways to break through and become more <br/>\n&quot;real.&quot; The end is kinda &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; in feel. <br/>\n<br/>\n       I wonder if those of us who were schooled ourselves but now have <br/>\nunschooled awhile will actually appreciate it more (or on more levels) than those <br/>\nwho can only see it from inside the school perspective. I think the social webs <br/>\nschoolkids weave might have such emotional resonance that those people will <br/>\ntake the movie literally, and maybe miss the metaphorical (or allegorical or <br/>\nwhatever) layers.
