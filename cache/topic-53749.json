I wanted to<br/>\nrespond to a few things before I get even further behind!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; From: bluelotus &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bluelotus@...\">bluelotus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: Happy New Year, a real self-intro, and some questions<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Hi Hikaru,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Where did you learn Japanese?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I actually majored in Japanese at a certain prestigious university on the<br/>\nEast Coast and studied for a year in an intensive program at a prestigious<br/>\nuniversity in Tokyo and guess what? Most of what I have learned of  Japanese<br/>\nlanguage and culture is IN SPITE OF what they taught me in class....I<br/>\nlearned through daily contact with Japanese people, and through my own<br/>\nefforts..... gee does that sound like unschooling, perhaps?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a Masters in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages,<br/>\nthe politically correct term for ESL or EFL) and my theory about learning<br/>\nlanguages is that anyone can do it, but like any skill it will come easier<br/>\nfor some people than for others.<br/>\nJapanese isn&#39;t a hard language to learn, and I LOVE to tell Japanese people<br/>\nthat I think English is harder, speaking as someone who has taught English<br/>\nto non-native speakers for<br/>\nabout 15 years. Japanese jaws tend to drop, because it seems to be a matter<br/>\nof pride that the language is so unique and hard to master. IMO every<br/>\nlanguage and every culture is unique.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I enjoy reading about history, but there is a lot I still don&#39;t know.  I<br/>\n&gt; was actually startled to read in an article about Trent Lott that when<br/>\n&gt; Strom Thurmond was running for prez, 1948, NO African-Americans in<br/>\n&gt; Lott&#39;s state of Mississippi were allowed to vote.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&gt;I always thought that slavery was never legal in Canada.

It&#39;s been a really<br/>\ngood (and humbling) experience. As for racism, that&#39;s a subject I address in<br/>\none of my college classes.<br/>\nWe read an interview with Rosa Parks, and<br/>\nit is very interesting how willing the students are to discuss the Civil<br/>\nRights movenent in the U.S., but are not so comfortable talking about<br/>\ndiscrimination against Korean, Chinese, and Ainu residents in Japan. Hits a<br/>\nbit too close to home, I think. Although I did have one student &quot;come out&quot;<br/>\nas Korean. That was a very brave young woman. I was really proud of her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Betsy wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Overall, our culture (in the US) has what feels to me like a nasty,<br/>\n&gt;schoolmarmish, red-pencil-wielding tone about not knowing the &quot;right&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;stuff at the &quot;right time&quot;.  There are certain &quot;important&quot; things that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;we&#39;re all supposed to learn the day before the test.  Learning anything<br/>\n&gt;&gt;after the test doesn&#39;t count as learning.  Those red marks pointing out<br/>\n&gt;&gt;ignorance don&#39;t go away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This was very good for me to hear, thank you Betsy. I deal with this all the<br/>\ntime. The Japanese education system is mainly geared toward entrance<br/>\nexaminations and I forget that the U.S. too is overly focused on testing and<br/>\nerror correction, and sets too many students up for failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nHikaru, about to go make raisin cookies with my son<br/>\nAh the joys of flour all over the kitchen, can&#39;t wait!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53260,"nextTopicId":53751}}
