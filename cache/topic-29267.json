And<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t like simple stories anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm....just had an idea.......maybe we need to find some fun poems,  where<br/>\nthe length is not intimidating and the flow of the language is usually<br/>\n*fun*.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some looooooong pauses<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;but she would eventually figure out the word (sounding out phoneticly).<br/>\n&gt;These pauses were unbelievably long and made me uncomfortable. I realized<br/>\n&gt;that *part* of our problem is I&#39;m impatient. I see her struggling so I jump<br/>\n&gt;in and tell her the word. She doesn&#39;t like this *at all*.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is something that Lars hates.  One of the problems we had working with<br/>\nreading is that we didn&#39;t figure out a signal that he could use to let me<br/>\nknow that he wanted help.  You might want to talk with your daughter about<br/>\nhow she wants you to handle those spaces.  Just wait?  Wait till she asks<br/>\nfor help?  She gives you a signal that says she wants help?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;More than that, though, I think *I* could be her biggest obstacle because<br/>\n </span></blockquote>of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;my rush-rush personality which doesn&#39;t allow her the time she needs to<br/>\n&gt;figure things out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is one reason I suggested that you try having her read silently, just<br/>\npointing to or spelling out words she wants help with.  Then you could be<br/>\ndoing something else (that you don&#39;t mind interruptions with) and just tell<br/>\nher the words.  This way, you wouldn&#39;t even know that she was struggling<br/>\nuntil she asked you a word, and your impatience wouldn&#39;t come into it.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nTia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island<br/>\n****************************************************************************<br/>\n****************<br/>\nIt is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. - Janice<br/>\nLevy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29434,"nextTopicId":29312}}
