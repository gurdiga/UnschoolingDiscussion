Then I realized it was silly, and we asked him what he thought. The <br/>\ninteresting thing is, that although he is close to his father and sees him <br/>\nevery day, Julian did not want him to be involved--just his lesbian moms.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70472,"nextTopicId":70335}}
