They live in colonies of hundreds or even<br/>\nthousands in the wild, and will become depressed and die if left on<br/>\ntheir own.  You don&#39;t need to own that many, though! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best website I have found is www.hermit-crabs.com <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hermit crabs are my special pets, because I have loved them since<br/>\nI was a kid, so I &quot;allowed&quot; myself to get them about a year after we<br/>\ndropped school-at-home and started unschooling.  So I have had them<br/>\nfor a really long time now, almost three years! YAY!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have six of them, and they have lived for the whole time.  One of<br/>\nthem, the seventh one, died soon after I bought him though, so I think<br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t very healthy to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent a long time researching how to build a habitat for them, and<br/>\nwhat kinds of foods to give them, and how to keep them healthy.  It<br/>\nwas sooo much fun!  And that was when I knew that I finally &quot;got&quot; the<br/>\nunschooling stuff, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan M in VA<br/>\nwifetovegman</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110852,"nextTopicId":110839}}
