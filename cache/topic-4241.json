Certainly ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2024691491\">What are your interests?  Do you spend time pursuing them?  Modeling the pursuit<br/>\nof your interests can be the most important model they have.  Certainly<br/>\nrequiring study is at odds with your underlying hopes.  Gordon Neufeld ( a<br/>\ndevelopmental and clinical psychologist) was talking about the &quot;eclectic&quot;<br/>\napproach to parenting that people have and how it doesn&#39;t work.  Behaviorism and<br/>\na developmental point of view are really quite mutually exclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if learning is the same.  Allowing freedom of choice when we are<br/>\ncomfortable with the choices and then &quot;clamping down&quot; when we panic are mutually<br/>\nexclusive behaviours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think trying to give oneself over fully to the belief that the &quot;kid&#39;s alright&quot;<br/>\nis the goal.  Once you really get that straight all else follows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen of course it takes time for the kids to get over all the confusing, mixed<br/>\nmessages we have been sending for so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning takes place all the time.  You can&#39;t always see it and it is certainly<br/>\nnot always quantifiable even if you can see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, learning is taking place. I think that looking to your own interests and<br/>\nmodeling that is the most potent assist for kids in seeing what the love of<br/>\nlearning looks like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also admit that I don&#39;t know the dynamics of large families very well.  Your<br/>\nkids are really mostly very young.  Really really have faith.  Nurture their<br/>\nattachment to you.  Don&#39;t nudge them from the nest.  Independence comes<br/>\nnaturally and at its own pace and really doesn&#39;t happen until the late teen<br/>\nyears for most kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy them for who they are now.  Don&#39;t let a bunch of your expectations and<br/>\nunrealized dreams of your own contaminate their lives.  They are good and okay<br/>\nand smart.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir motivation is theirs.  You can&#39;t make someone be motivated.  If they<br/>\nreally are just laid back types who like to just take what comes along.  (You&#39;ll<br/>\nknow maybe by the time they are 30 or so.) so what?  This work ethic thing is<br/>\nvastly over rated.  Henry David Thoreau is needed more today than ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou establish the flavor and tenor of your household along with your husband.<br/>\nYou set only the broadest of limits for the children especially as they grow<br/>\nolder.  Little ones naturally accept your definitions of how things are and then<br/>\ntheir own view emerge when they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear and see myself giving stirring little talks to people and I will publicly<br/>\nconfess that these are as much to myself as anyone else.  For me it is an effort<br/>\nto overcome the devastation of my own childhood.  I was dealt some terrible<br/>\nblows very early on which damaged my abilities to trust in the &quot;rightness&#39; of<br/>\nanything.  They are blows which most people sustain in varying degrees.  In my<br/>\ncase they have contributed to a negativity and distrust which is poisonous.  I<br/>\nam grateful that my children are resilient and forgiving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am rambling.  I am also recovering from a 16 hour shift of overtime ....<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Sisemore wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Julie Sisemore&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:familiesrforever@...\">familiesrforever@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have spent quite a while, since my kids were very little, reading about<br/>\n&gt; various hs methods.  Unschooling...child inititated learning is the one that<br/>\n&gt; philosophically made a lot of sense to me.  I see a lot of value in letting<br/>\n&gt; children learn what they are interested in and when.  I get HEM and am<br/>\n&gt; always inspired by it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think we are going through a growth phase right now.  My oldest is getting<br/>\n&gt; to an age, where it seems that talking about things isn&#39;t enough learning<br/>\n&gt; opportunity.  It used to be easy to just talk about things in the car on the<br/>\n&gt; way to town.... but I can&#39;t always answer her questions now.  Or my other<br/>\n&gt; kids either as they grow older.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I let them be each day.... 90% of their day would be watching TV (if I<br/>\n&gt; let them), playing, fighting, and maybe some coloring.  While I understand<br/>\n&gt; the value of down time, it seems the last year has been all down time.  And<br/>\n&gt; I often see their behavior, when so undirected, to deteriorate into<br/>\n&gt; fighting, whinning, aggravating each other.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately the only thing I can usually think of is to require some type<br/>\n&gt; of study or work from them.  Which they often resent and doesn&#39;t always<br/>\n&gt; produce positive results.  My 9 1/2 yo has a lot of interests. But she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t engage in most of them, and just complains about boredom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t had the experiences I read about in places like HEM, where my kids<br/>\n&gt; go out into our woods for the day and explore, or get out a cookbook and<br/>\n&gt; determine to make a surprise, or choose a particular interest and ask me to<br/>\n&gt; help them further it. They seem so completely unmotivated.  It&#39;s gone on<br/>\n&gt; long enough as to seem a personalitiy trait, not a passing stage!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, now that my kids are older, I&#39;m wondering how to make unschooling still<br/>\n&gt; fit for us.  Is this just an adjustment stage we&#39;re going through?  My kids<br/>\n&gt; are smart, and although I&#39;d like it to be of their initiation, I would like<br/>\n&gt; to see some learning take place!

Unschooling...child inititated learning is the one that <br/>\nphilosophically made a lot of sense to me.  I see a lot of value in letting <br/>\nchildren learn what they are interested in and when.  I get HEM and am <br/>\nalways inspired by it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we are going through a growth phase right now.  My oldest is getting <br/>\nto an age, where it seems that talking about things isn&#39;t enough learning <br/>\nopportunity.  It used to be easy to just talk about things in the car on the <br/>\nway to town.... but I can&#39;t always answer her questions now.  Or my other <br/>\nkids either as they grow older.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I let them be each day.... 90% of their day would be watching TV (if I <br/>\nlet them), playing, fighting, and maybe some coloring.  While I understand <br/>\nthe value of down time, it seems the last year has been all down time.  And <br/>\nI often see their behavior, when so undirected, to deteriorate into <br/>\nfighting, whinning, aggravating each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately the only thing I can usually think of is to require some type <br/>\nof study or work from them.  Which they often resent and doesn&#39;t always <br/>\nproduce positive results.  My 9 1/2 yo has a lot of interests. But she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t engage in most of them, and just complains about boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t had the experiences I read about in places like HEM, where my kids <br/>\ngo out into our woods for the day and explore, or get out a cookbook and <br/>\ndetermine to make a surprise, or choose a particular interest and ask me to <br/>\nhelp them further it. They seem so completely unmotivated.  It&#39;s gone on <br/>\nlong enough as to seem a personalitiy trait, not a passing stage!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now that my kids are older, I&#39;m wondering how to make unschooling still <br/>\nfit for us.  Is this just an adjustment stage we&#39;re going through?  My kids <br/>\nare smart, and although I&#39;d like it to be of their initiation, I would like <br/>\nto see some learning take place!
