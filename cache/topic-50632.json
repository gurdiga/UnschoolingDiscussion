He <br/>\nnodded, &quot;yes,in his testicles.&quot;  &quot;OK&quot;, I said.. &quot;and where is the egg stored <br/>\nin Mommy?&quot;  &quot;In her ovaries&quot; he repliled.. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said. and where are <br/>\nthey.?&quot;  He pointed to the correct place on his tummy. &quot;Thats right&quot;, I <br/>\nsaid.. &quot;So, how what do you think the quickest route from Mommy to Daddy <br/>\nwould be?&quot;  He though a minute and his eyes got wide.. He said.. &quot;You mean, <br/>\n.. Daddy puts his penis inside your vagina?&quot;   &quot;Yes, thats right&quot; I said  <br/>\n&quot;Men and women have sex because they love each other.  When they make love, <br/>\nthe sperm comes out of the man and if the womans egg is just right, she can <br/>\nget pregnant&quot;   And thats how he learned the basics of sex.   My daugher <br/>\nlearned when she was about 10, she wasnt quite a precocious.  My 11 yo son <br/>\nstill doesnt know ALL about sex, but when he asks, when he&#39;s ready, he&#39;ll <br/>\nknow too.  When my oldest son was about 10, he came downstairs one night to <br/>\nour bed.  He was very worried.. He wanted to ask me something. .. &quot;What is it <br/>\nhoney&quot; I asked him.. He said..&quot; Well, Ive been worrying about this, and I <br/>\njust wanted to ask you if anything was wrong&quot;  &quot;Ok, what is it, you can ask <br/>\nme&quot;  I reassured him. He said.. &quot;Well, sometimes when I play with my penis it <br/>\ngets all slippery, is that supposed to happen?&quot; I  said. &quot; Oh, yeah, yeah, <br/>\ndont worry about that, that is perfectly normal. nothing is wrong with you, <br/>\nyour fine&quot;  He said., very relieved.. &quot;Oh good, I was scared about it&quot;   My <br/>\nchildren have seen selective R rated movies since they were as young as 8.  <br/>\nIt all depends on the child and the content.  Anna wont watch Titantic <br/>\nbecause she is too tender hearted.   Sex doesnt &quot;bother&quot; Landon ( hes 16)  <br/>\nbut graphic violence does.   Ethan and JP seem to get a thrill from the gore <br/>\nand guts, but too much &quot;supernatural&quot; stuff bothers them.   If we want to <br/>\nhave wine or beer with our supper, we do. If we want to tell dirty jokes, we <br/>\ndo.  If we want to get mad and cuss each other out, we do.   Landons friends <br/>\nsmoke pot, but Landon doesnt. If he smokes or drinks, he&#39;ll call one of us to <br/>\ncome get him.. But I highly doubt he will becasue he thinks its ignorant.  <br/>\nSome of Anna&#39;s friends have experimented with sex, but Anna hasnt.. If she <br/>\nwants to, she&#39;ll talk to me about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, you dont really know me.  You have made assumptions about me and my <br/>\nfamily that are way off the mark.   I may not be an &quot;unschooler&quot; but that <br/>\ncertainly doesnt mean i am an uptight repressed overprotective parent.  Most <br/>\nparent are shocked by my parenting approach.  I hope none of you are too <br/>\nshocked.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"gaps between adults and children, or living as people","postDate":"1038088039","msgId":50632,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExOS4xYjI2MzM1OC4yYjExNTE2N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50639,"prevInTime":50631,"nextInTime":50633,"topicId":50632,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/23/02 2:26:17 PM, freeform@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2082757514\">In a message dated 11/23/02 2:26:17 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:freeform@...\">freeform@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We do adjust our behavior for different situations, but having kids<br/>\naround doesn&#39;t tend to define the situation.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood way to put it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids and I can both adjust our behaviors depending who&#39;s around, what <br/>\ntheir sensitivities are preferences are, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can discuss R rated movies with our kids, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a family with a teenager (even a young teen) who hasn&#39;t seen R rated <br/>\nmovies with the parents is in such a different mindset from our family that <br/>\nthe discussion will be apples and avocados.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&gt; Trying to overcome that would be a huge step toward understanding <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I dont see that as something to overcome. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s fine, but I do and truly believe that unschooling will be difficult if <br/>\nyou deal differently with your teenaged daughter, and you don&#39;t consider <br/>\nyourself to be her peer, than you deal with other people.  The more you treat <br/>\nher like a whole person instead of a child, the easier it will be for you to <br/>\nunderstand what unschoolers are talking about when they talk about natural <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Kids are not &quot;little adults&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I  think some topics are inappropiate for children to be exposed to. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are a few, depending on the child.  But if the rule is made <br/>\nexpressly to separate children from adults, that gap is hard to bridge.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My husband and I maybe out for dinner and drinks with another <br/>\ncouple, and the conversations turns to sex, or we may discuss an R rated <br/>\nmovie that we have seen recently.  I may have a heart to heart talk with a <br/>\ngirlfriend or sister about marital problems.   I may discuss concerns for <br/>\nover my childrens behavior with another mother.   My husband and I may <br/>\ndisdoesn&#39;t necessarily have to do with age differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t ever discuss sex with a thirteen year old girl, that&#39;s going to <br/>\nbe a problem any day now.  I&#39;m more likely to discuss concerns over my c<br/>\nhildren&#39;s behavior with them or their friends than with my other adult <br/>\nfriends.  But because of that I have very few concerns about their behavior.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not something that&#39;s discussed behind their backs, it&#39;s one part of the <br/>\nlarger relationship--both my concerns and their behavior.  My concerns are <br/>\noften more a problem than their actions.  They call it &quot;mom stuff.&quot;  They&#39;re <br/>\nsensitive to &quot;mom stuff,&quot; but they know it for what it is--protective <br/>\ninstinct, projection, sensitivity to what others think...<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause they are acknowledged to have as much mature (&quot;adult&quot; perhaps in your <br/>\nparlance) awareness and sensitivity as they come to have, they have quite a <br/>\nfull range of it!  If I waited for them to be 16 or 18 to talk about human <br/>\ninterrelationships, why moms worry, why kids need freedom, why their friends <br/>\nare being the way they are, they would have made dozens or hundreds of <br/>\nmistakes without the benefit of analysis before they got to the point that <br/>\nthey would be out on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t we all adjust our behavior to the situation and <br/>\ncircumstances that we are in?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI speak differently with longterm friends than I would with their <br/>\ngrandmothers.  I discuss different things with toddlers than I do with <br/>\nteenagers.  But in every case, I am relieved when and if that other person is <br/>\nable to meet me as a person and talk about something real and meaningful.  <br/>\nAnd it will happen more often if you expect it to happen and allow for it to <br/>\nhappen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation and circumstances of unschooling, in my own life, have involved <br/>\nhelping my children be in the world by their being in the world, with <br/>\ndiscussion and commentary and analysis.  In that exploration, I am their <br/>\npeer.  I got here first, but I don&#39;t know everything.  They learn from me, <br/>\nbut I learn from them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this was just lately mentioned, but it&#39;s too applicable not to mention <br/>\nagain here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/zeneverything\">http://sandradodd.com/zeneverything</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHolly discussing &quot;zen&quot; before she could read, Marty discussing parenting when <br/>\nhe was three, Kirby discussing how learning is passed on...<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50640,"nextTopicId":50724}}
