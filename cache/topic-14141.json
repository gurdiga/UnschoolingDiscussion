It&#39;s not about Maths or English or Physics <br/>\nor French, it&#39;s about learning what you want/need to learn, when <br/>\nyou want/need to learn it.  If that means learning how to deal with <br/>\nnot having someone else program your time, then that&#39;s a useful <br/>\nlesson, I think.  My children switched the telly off yesterday, <br/>\nwithout being asked, in the morning while I was still asleep!  <br/>\nWhen I figured it out, I nearly cheered!  My eldest is learning that <br/>\nshe can walk away from situations she doesn&#39;t want to be in, and <br/>\nthe youngest is learning that people don&#39;t want to be around her <br/>\nwhen she&#39;s behaving bossily.
