This is all fine and true with families that are onboard with unschooling and all of the trust that goes with those close fitting relationships is present.   But maybe the point where it all gets confusing is when there are ulterior motives in the strewing.  Or families are in different places as far as trusting each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if a family is new to unschooling, as we were 3 years ago,  and I strewed some things around,  my son might question looking at what I strewed.

Before unschooling I&#39;m sure I was always trying to &quot;educate&quot; him or trying to get him to learn what I thought he should learn.   Those efforts led to a distrust in me.  Why would he want to try the things I&#39;m suggesting when it was usually what I thought he should learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where it seems like strewing could be manipulation or artificial in its origin.  Maybe it all depends on the motives behind the strewing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me it seems like if we lead an interesting life and share that with our children,  the strewing just happens.  (As others have said.)

Kirby was hesitant about what <br/>\ngames to take and talked to me about his concerns about that crowd, so I <br/>\nadvised him to pick games that are easy for people to join or drop out of or stand <br/>\nat the side of and watch, rather than games people have to be dealt into or <br/>\nstart from the beginning.  He didn&#39;t expect them to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out he put encore out as soon as they got there, 7:30, and it was <br/>\nplayed non-stop until 11:00.  Then an spontaneous game of &quot;killer&quot; (spies and <br/>\nsecret &quot;deaths) started--nobody said &quot;let&#39;s play&quot; and nobody reviewed the rules, it <br/>\njust started and played through.  Marty told me and Keith all about it at <br/>\nbreakfast.  He was elated.  And they boys came home by 2:00, and more awake and <br/>\nalert on the way home because of their satisfaction with the way the games <br/>\nhelped the party than they had been on the way out--wary  and not expecting the <br/>\nbest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of people on unschooling lists bragging it up, we bought Five Crowns <br/>\nyears back.

I want the old ones if you&#39;re getting new ones.  So Wendy <br/>\nhas one set and Cathyn has the other, but we who play TONS have the third.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sunday before Christmas an older friend from Denver was here just for the <br/>\none evening, with other friends.  They suggested Five Crowns.  Her kids are <br/>\nlong grown, but she really wants to buy that game when she gets home.  We <br/>\nplayed two full games and then played the word version, Quiddler.   The boys and <br/>\nfive or six of their friends were playing other games in another room.  Holly <br/>\nwas off with a friend of hers.  We had no less fun with this game than we would <br/>\nhave had when we were playing it because others had said it was an easy game <br/>\nfor little kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Dan Narigon was stuck in Albuquerque after the 9/11 attack (he&#39;s an air <br/>\nforce officer and had been at Kirtland AFB on a contract job, but they closed <br/>\nthe base so the meetings weren&#39;t happening, but he couldn&#39;t fly home either), <br/>\nwe played Five Crowns two nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something starts one way and becomes a normal part of a busy, bubbling <br/>\nlife, it took hold and that&#39;s that.

And he  might <br/>\nreciprocate! &lt;g&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it be MIGHTY cool if someone *you* loved  picked up a book or <br/>\nmovie about something *you&#39;re* passionate about and learned  a little more <br/>\nabout it?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: .RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Doing too little?","postDate":"1104557363","msgId":102001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZC4zM2ZlNDZmYS4yZjA3OGYzM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":102007,"prevInTime":102000,"nextInTime":102002,"topicId":102001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/31/2004 9:58:34 P.M.
