If I&#39;m gone for too long, my husband knows where to find me.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see, I&#39;ve got a shelf full of books to read in both bathrooms, some in<br/>\nour living room, and some in our bedroom. I really like discovering a writer<br/>\nafter they&#39;ve written lots of books in a series. Then I read one after<br/>\nanother in sequence. When I&#39;ve finished reading them, I pack them up and<br/>\nsend them to my mom, who reads them and then passes them on to her friends<br/>\nat the nursing home she works at. So, they get a good work out!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve recently read all the Martha Grime mystery books that have been written<br/>\n(not all are great, but once I start on a series, I want to read them all),<br/>\nI really like Anne Perry, Some authors that I like: Elizabeth George,<br/>\nElizabeth Peters (Amelia Peabody), Orson Scott Card, Ellis Peters (Cadfael<br/>\nseries). I review lots of non-fiction, so it&#39;s nice to balance it with<br/>\nfiction. I like a good mystery or sci-fi novel, one that gives me something<br/>\nnew to learn (about a time in history, what the future could be like,<br/>\nsomething about forensics, etc), with characters who have to deal with<br/>\neveryday issues/relationships/moral quandaries, while pulling me forward to<br/>\nan interesting ending (such as solving the murder).<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\nVisit our Web Site!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.FUN-Books.com\">http://www.FUN-Books.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: David & Betsy Wright [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deejay@...\">deejay@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, February 03, 2000 1:16 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Books<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;David & Betsy Wright&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deejay@...\">deejay@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now really, nobody on this list would do anything like that!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m sure no one&#39;s dh has ever been spotted walking &quot;that way&quot; with a copy<br/>\nof Dumbing Us Down.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Certainly none of us have book catalogs on our bathroom scales.

Lewis, Erma Bombeck, <br/>\nDave Barry, Laurie King, zillions of others, and most nonfiction.  I have to <br/>\nsay that I do not enjoy the fantasy sci-fi genre.
