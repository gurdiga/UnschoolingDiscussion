Category A drugs are perfectly safe.  There are few of <br/>\nthese because few drug companies want to claim that even a drug like <br/>\nadvil is perfectly safe for babies and pregnant moms and lactating moms. <br/>\nCategory B moms are considered fine, and most are prescribed to infants <br/>\nwithout a second thought.  Personally if a drug is prescribed to an <br/>\ninfant then it&#39;s OK for a lactating mother or pregnant mother.  Catagory <br/>\nC drugs are more dangerous and if possible it is better to find an <br/>\nalternative in the B category.  Category D drugs are to be avoided.  <br/>\nGenerally if a drug has been approved for pregnancy it is safe during <br/>\nlactation.  Of course, not all docs know all this information so Hales <br/>\nis a good book to have around, and most good LLL Leaders have a copy or <br/>\nknow someone who does, so they can look up and see what&#39;s the REAL scoop <br/>\nwith a drug, so the mother can make an INFORMED choice.  Another good <br/>\nbook that has common drugs and their effect upon breastfeeding is the <br/>\nBreastfeeding Answer Book which most LLL Leaders will have. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have spoken to many moms who pumped and dumped while they took a drug <br/>\nthat was perfectly safe for their child to have while breastfeeding.  <br/>\nThe baby had bottles of artificial milk, which was and is, in the long <br/>\nterm, far worse than a little breastmilk with a small amount of whatever <br/>\ndrug in it.  This has been done for every drug under the sun, including <br/>\nantibiotics, antidepressants, and other drugs that have been proven to <br/>\nbe perfectly fine during lactation.  Sometimes the result of giving <br/>\nbottles is that the baby refuses to go back to the breast so mom <br/>\neventually stops pumping, and baby is now a formula consumer!  Hey hey, <br/>\nmore money for the formula company! <br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore not all drugs pass through to the milk.  Some drugs pass <br/>\nthrough in such minimal amounts as to be barely detectable.  At any <br/>\nrate, depending upon a baby&#39;s age and breastfeeding patterns, moms can <br/>\noften breastfeed around the dosage time to prevent drugs from getting to <br/>\nbaby. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Seems to me the *necessity* of using these various substances has to<br/>\n&gt; be measured and valued very carefully in any given situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh most definitely, but I have heard of way too many women NOT <br/>\nbreastfeed (my doctor said I couldn&#39;t use my asthma inhaler if I was <br/>\nbreastfeeding, my doctor said my high blood pressure meds weren&#39;t <br/>\ncompatible with breastfeeding or whatever, when most of the time what <br/>\nthe doctor said is simply not true and there is almost always a way to <br/>\nget the meds needed and still breastfeed) because of a fear of using a <br/>\nparticular drug. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I&#39;d rather a child have a week of something rather not good <br/>\nfor it and then go on to have years of further breastfeeding then mom to <br/>\nwean and the baby to get artificial baby milk.  Also as someone who <br/>\npumped, breastmilk is liquid gold and the idea of dumping something <br/>\nunnecessarily is horrid. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; namaste,<br/>\n&gt; cris<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s worth the inconvenience of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting around alot with your babe afterwards to protect that tiny<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being from an unnecessary trauma.

I lurk but have a story that&#39;s applicable. But first a<br/>\n&gt; couple of questions:  do you have help after the birth--an adult 24-7<br/>\n&gt; or older child/ren who&#39;ll be able to carry the babe?  If so, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; recommend foregoing the massive doses of drugs til after the birth,<br/>\n&gt; when you can be sitting around recovering and others can bring the<br/>\n&gt; babe to you when s/he&#39;s not in your arms already :~)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s why I say this:  June 1994 I was 34 weeks pregnant with twins,<br/>\n&gt; while mothering my other two kids who were 9 and 6 at the time.  Had<br/>\n&gt; a car accident  (VERY long story) and ended up in labor, then<br/>\n&gt; delivering (two perfectly healthy girls), with a broken right thumb<br/>\n&gt; and a fractured right ankle.  Surgery on thumb, (local AND general<br/>\n&gt; anesthesia) was two days after birth.  Pumped milk from moments after<br/>\n&gt; birth til moments before local to allow bottle feeding by myself and<br/>\n&gt; others for the two days that drugs were in my body.  Pumped and threw<br/>\n&gt; away during those two days.  Then resumed breastfeeding. Hobbled<br/>\n&gt; about on crutches (one specially made for persons with an injured<br/>\n&gt; hand as well as foot) while children and hubby carted babies to and<br/>\n&gt; fro in moses baskets when necessary. <br/>\n&gt; Also, in my experience, being on crutches is WAAAYYY more challenging<br/>\n&gt; when you center of gravity is &quot;thrown off&quot; by that gorgeous belly. <br/>\n&gt; MUCH easier with only your own weight to throw around... :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If it were me in your situation, and I knew I would have the help I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; need, I would not allow a fetus to go through the trauma of<br/>\n&gt; processing those drugs if it were not absolutely necessary.  Even if<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t have a lot of help, I think it&#39;s worth the inconvenience of<br/>\n&gt; sitting around alot with your babe afterwards to protect that tiny<br/>\n&gt; being from an unnecessary trauma.

I lurk but have a story that&#39;s applicable. But first a <br/>\ncouple of questions:  do you have help after the birth--an adult 24-7 <br/>\nor older child/ren who&#39;ll be able to carry the babe?  If so, I&#39;d <br/>\nrecommend foregoing the massive doses of drugs til after the birth, <br/>\nwhen you can be sitting around recovering and others can bring the <br/>\nbabe to you when s/he&#39;s not in your arms already :~)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s why I say this:  June 1994 I was 34 weeks pregnant with twins, <br/>\nwhile mothering my other two kids who were 9 and 6 at the time.  Had <br/>\na car accident  (VERY long story) and ended up in labor, then <br/>\ndelivering (two perfectly healthy girls), with a broken right thumb <br/>\nand a fractured right ankle.  Surgery on thumb, (local AND general <br/>\nanesthesia) was two days after birth.  Pumped milk from moments after <br/>\nbirth til moments before local to allow bottle feeding by myself and <br/>\nothers for the two days that drugs were in my body.  Pumped and threw <br/>\naway during those two days.  Then resumed breastfeeding. Hobbled <br/>\nabout on crutches (one specially made for persons with an injured <br/>\nhand as well as foot) while children and hubby carted babies to and <br/>\nfro in moses baskets when necessary.  <br/>\nAlso, in my experience, being on crutches is WAAAYYY more challenging <br/>\nwhen you center of gravity is &quot;thrown off&quot; by that gorgeous belly.  <br/>\nMUCH easier with only your own weight to throw around... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me in your situation, and I knew I would have the help I&#39;d <br/>\nneed, I would not allow a fetus to go through the trauma of <br/>\nprocessing those drugs if it were not absolutely necessary.  Even if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t have a lot of help, I think it&#39;s worth the inconvenience of <br/>\nsitting around alot with your babe afterwards to protect that tiny <br/>\nbeing from an unnecessary trauma.  I guess you can tell I feel pretty <br/>\nstrongly about this... :~)<br/>\n<br/>\nnamaste,<br/>\ncris </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77026201,"authorName":"lydia campbell","from":"lydia campbell &lt;ljkc94@...&gt;","profile":"ljkc94","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] pregnancy and surgery","postDate":"1064178481","msgId":81168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTIxMjEwODAxLjI1NTcxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEwMzA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0ZS4yM2Y4YmNiZi4yYzlmMTE1MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":81138,"nextInTopic":81169,"prevInTime":81167,"nextInTime":81169,"topicId":81115,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Elizabeth, As a nurse anesthetist with 20 years experience, I would suggest a spinal anesthetic.
