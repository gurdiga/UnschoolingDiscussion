It can cause glandular fever in teens and is associated with<br/>\ninfectious mononucleosis and CFS.<br/>\n<br/>\nTay-Sachs on the other hand is something they test for with an amnio.  It is<br/>\na genetic condition in which the body stores waste products in the cells or<br/>\ntissues and the build up causes damage which results in the cell/tissues&#39;s<br/>\nloss of ability to function properly.  There are a whole family of these<br/>\ndiseases known as the NTSAD family and sometimes when doctors are testing<br/>\nfor something in that family, the only one that people pick up on from the<br/>\nlist is the Tay-Sachs because that one they&#39;ve heard of.  I mean, how many<br/>\nfolks have heard of  Fabry, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick, Canavan, Sandhoff,<br/>\nKrabbe, Wolman, Hurler or for that matter, Asparylglucosaminuria and that&#39;s<br/>\nthe short list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to genetics and it taking both, that only applies to the child having the<br/>\nactive disease, not to the child being a carrier.  The woman could very<br/>\neasily have the disease or carry the disease, her husband would not be a<br/>\nfactor in that.  And, being Catholic has absolutely nothing to do with<br/>\nwhether or not one could be a carrier.  To be a Jew is to be from an ethnic<br/>\ngroup and does not mean that one is Jewish in religion.  Where one is from<br/>\ndoes not guarantee that is what one&#39;s complete ancestry is either.  A real<br/>\ngood example of that is a group of Africans who have the same genetic coding<br/>\n(Jewish Y-chromosome, not the European or African Y-chromosome) as a certain<br/>\nsect of Jewish rabbis.  As long as blood testing and genetic testing has<br/>\nbeen around it was thought and then tested for and only this one group of<br/>\nrabbis was found to have this one specific variant of the Jewish<br/>\nY-chromosome.  Now a very small population of Africans have been found that<br/>\nnot only have practiced a form of Judiasm for hundreds of years but have<br/>\nthis specific Jewish Y-chromosome.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile amnios are done as a relatively safe procedure, orders for them aren&#39;t<br/>\nhanded out like the ones for ultrasounds.

To my knowledge it is not a standard test, and<br/>\n&gt; indeed you have to sign several &quot;informed consent&quot; types of papers to even<br/>\n&gt; have one. Usually they are suggested after an abnormal blood test reading<br/>\n&gt; indicating some form of genetic problem. I was on a pregnancy list for<br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; of my kids (Sep &#39;96 list and Oct &#39;99 list) and only a few women out of the<br/>\n&gt; hundreds on those lists had amnios. If there are doctors out there doing<br/>\n&gt; them routinely, that would be scary. Let alone &quot;forcing&quot; women to have<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doctor told her it was a one in a million chance that it was the amnio<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; caused that miscarriage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hmmm, sounds like lawsuit material to me.

And some things <br/>\nwhich are considered Good and Right are later found to have been not so good <br/>\nand not so right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAntibiotics.<br/>\nMilk being good for everyone.<br/>\nBaby formula (i.e. evaporated milk and sugar) being as good as breast milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would not be racist to suggest that African Americans are more likely to <br/>\nbe lactose intolerant than northern Europeans.  It would be insanely <br/>\n&quot;politically correct&quot; to treat everyone exactly the same, medically, <br/>\nregardless of genetic liklihoods.  To test all of Iceland for sickle cell <br/>\nanemia, or Mexico for Tay-Sachs would be a misuse of medical testing.  Would <br/>\nit be racist to screen FIRST before checking only those with a possibility of <br/>\nhaving the disease?  My friend Carol lost a baby from having amniocentesis to <br/>\ncheck for Tay-Sachs or Epstein Barr or something which she could only have <br/>\nhad if she AND her husband were Eastern European Jews.  Her husband is Irish <br/>\nCatholic.   They tested her anyway.  Someday amnio will be seen as a horror <br/>\nfoisted upon many women against their wills, but right now it&#39;s not.  The <br/>\ndoctor told her it was a one in a million chance that it was the amnio that <br/>\ncaused that miscarriage.  Let&#39;s see... the miscarriage started within about <br/>\n20 hours of the amnio, and the statistics I&#39;ve seen are between 1 in 100 and <br/>\n1 in 300 (180/200 are most quoted) on ANY amniocentesis causing loss of <br/>\npregnancy.  Those were the stats last I knew, when I was involved with <br/>\ncesarean prevention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Yes he was the Frenchman and no he isn&#39;t someone new. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he wasn&#39;t a medical guy either.  We could quote Shakespeare for period <br/>\nquotes, but as he was writing characters who aid all KINDS of things <br/>\nShakespeare himself didn&#39;t necessarily believe to be true, quoting <br/>\nShakespeare to prove some sort of point wouldn&#39;t work.  Same.  That&#39;s why I <br/>\nwas asking context.  Was it a letter to someone about medicine?  Or was it a <br/>\ncharacter in a play?  Or a political essay in which he was being figurative?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"usEUlszX_EGUjExfQLEfyMbmMhlNiZzsA9FdP1lkPggWsufyeNDVq1V10KLI06W4g-yqhFT8s6kloGwVTXaKzZUWNA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] doom and gloom--cessation,and plea for critical thinking","postDate":"987438901","msgId":18748,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjYwMWMwYzY5NiQ2MmI4MTg4MCRhOTVkZDFkMUBsZGlvbm5vPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwNDE1MTc0MDE5LjM0NTY0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMjA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPiA8M0FEQjE5NDAuRjRFNTAzNzhAY2MudXN1LmVkdT4="},"prevInTopic":18743,"nextInTopic":18767,"prevInTime":18747,"nextInTime":18749,"topicId":18736,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Let me preface this with a disclaimer.

Then if someone disagrees \nwith&nbsp;any of the&nbsp;points, even when they provide links and quotes from \nfolks*** who lived through part of the span in history inwhich the subject of \nthe discussion took place, do people persist in saying that no links or sources \nhave been given.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The fact remains that bloodletting was deadly and \nthat the current medical practices of bloodletting are discussing apples and \noranges.&nbsp; Bloodletting does not cure hemorrages, it does not cure sore \nthroats, it does not cure the plague and diseases aren&#39;t caused by humors and \ngetting rid of the humors by perging, starving, vomitting and bloodletting are \ngoing to cure any of those diseases.&nbsp; Now, if someone can find me a site \nthat says that the illnesses they were trying to cure by that method are now \nbeing cured by bloodletting, then we are talking apples to apples, oranges to \noranges.&nbsp; The use of leeches NOW is not for bloodletting but rather for \nincreasing blood flow.&nbsp; Again apples and oranges.&nbsp; The only thing that \nis used for the same reason now as it was then is maggots.&nbsp; Maggots were \nallowed to eat the dead flesh and they have been found to be an&nbsp;good \nresource and&nbsp;documented by the medical community&nbsp;resource \nfor&nbsp;removing gangrene and narcrotic flesh.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Therefore maggots comes under &quot;was o.k., then was \nyukky and unacceptable and now is o.k.&quot;&nbsp;

Yes he was the Frenchman and \nno he isn&#39;t someone new.&nbsp; I hold out my hands to the spelling police (again \nI am grinning here!) and throw myself on the mercy of the court.&nbsp; I plead \nbeing language-challenged due to a French teacher in 8th grade who was from \nMexico, lived in East LA and spoke French with a Spanish/East LA accent.&nbsp;
