I thought I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   share it with you.  I have 7-year-old fraternal twin boys named Leroy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and Paul.  In every way, they are very different from eachother.  This<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   post is about Leroy.  We call him &quot;Action Baby&quot; because he is a very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   physical, athletic, and kinetic sort of little boy.  He is also very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   verbal and asks a multitude of questions about everything all the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   He&#39;s incredibly curious.  Leroy requires a LOT of attention in many<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   different ways.  He is also a Juvenile Diabetic which involves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; between 4<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and 10 blood tests and 3 insulin injections on a daily basis, a pretty<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   rigid eating schedule, counting carbohydrates, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Last week we installed a new pretty blue iMac right next to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   kitchen.  It is officially &quot;my&quot; computer.  I love it.  I am also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fairly<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   new to this list.  I had heard about it for a couple of years but only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   joined about 2 weeks ago.  Well, you can imagine what happened.  The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   last few days, especially yesterday, I became totally engrossed with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   new toy and this list, of course.  I was online for hours.  I wanted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   reply to everything.  This is not like me, but, I couldn&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I was pretty unavailable to everyone.  I don&#39;t mean to say that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   totally ignored Leroy and told him to go away and not answer all his<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   questions, etc.  I was just very occupied with this computer and he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; did<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   not have my full attention.  I normally interact with my boys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   especially Leroy, almost all day long because that is what he asks for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   and, therefore, requires.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Well, last night, Leroy let me know, loud and clear, he did not like<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   this at all.  For a couple of hours, he was pretty upset.  He cried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   of the time and he was angry.  I think this is a very good example of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   how certain children can get very upset when they know they are being<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   ignored, or maybe even not the center of their mother&#39;s/father&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   attention, for very long periods of time (hours).  He has never been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   upset for such a long time before.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Boy, did I learn a lesson.

Been there once before when the kidlets were younger. We&#39;ll still be around when Leroy&#39;s older and has other interests that will allow you some computer time ;-)<br/>\nBest to you,<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: groundhoggirl <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 11:35 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Leroy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Something really interesting happened yesterday.  I thought I would <br/>\n  share it with you.  I have 7-year-old fraternal twin boys named Leroy <br/>\n  and Paul.  In every way, they are very different from eachother.  This <br/>\n  post is about Leroy.  We call him &quot;Action Baby&quot; because he is a very <br/>\n  physical, athletic, and kinetic sort of little boy.  He is also very <br/>\n  verbal and asks a multitude of questions about everything all the time.  <br/>\n  He&#39;s incredibly curious.  Leroy requires a LOT of attention in many <br/>\n  different ways.  He is also a Juvenile Diabetic which involves between 4 <br/>\n  and 10 blood tests and 3 insulin injections on a daily basis, a pretty <br/>\n  rigid eating schedule, counting carbohydrates, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last week we installed a new pretty blue iMac right next to the <br/>\n  kitchen.  It is officially &quot;my&quot; computer.  I love it.  I am also fairly <br/>\n  new to this list.  I had heard about it for a couple of years but only <br/>\n  joined about 2 weeks ago.  Well, you can imagine what happened.  The <br/>\n  last few days, especially yesterday, I became totally engrossed with my <br/>\n  new toy and this list, of course.  I was online for hours.  I wanted to <br/>\n  reply to everything.  This is not like me, but, I couldn&#39;t help myself.  <br/>\n  I was pretty unavailable to everyone.  I don&#39;t mean to say that I <br/>\n  totally ignored Leroy and told him to go away and not answer all his <br/>\n  questions, etc.  I was just very occupied with this computer and he did <br/>\n  not have my full attention.  I normally interact with my boys, <br/>\n  especially Leroy, almost all day long because that is what he asks for <br/>\n  and, therefore, requires.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, last night, Leroy let me know, loud and clear, he did not like <br/>\n  this at all.  For a couple of hours, he was pretty upset.  He cried most <br/>\n  of the time and he was angry.  I think this is a very good example of <br/>\n  how certain children can get very upset when they know they are being <br/>\n  ignored, or maybe even not the center of their mother&#39;s/father&#39;s <br/>\n  attention, for very long periods of time (hours).  He has never been so <br/>\n  upset for such a long time before.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Boy, did I learn a lesson.  I thoroughly enjoy this list, but there&#39;s no <br/>\n  way I&#39;ll be able to read all these messages or reply and all of those I <br/>\n  wish to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Guess what?!  I gotta go.
