For one week, simply write down whatever you see<br/>\nthe kids doing.  Keep tabs without making it a big deal so the kids don&#39;t<br/>\nstress over it.  At the end of each day, &quot;translate&quot; what you see the kids<br/>\ndoing into schoolish-type subjects and see that the kids really ARE<br/>\nlearning.  This can be a big help with husbands who &quot;just don&#39;t get it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  My 11yo spent her morning so far this way, caring for her animals<br/>\n(nutrition &lt;figuring what to feed each animal, adjusting protein for milk<br/>\ngoats&gt;, psychology &lt;operant conditioning used in training dog&gt;, math<br/>\n&lt;figuring weight of milk minus weight of bucket&gt;, bacteriology &lt;working to<br/>\nkeep things as sterile as possible to avoid spoilage&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nnext was a 4-H officers meeting (logistics &lt;planning who would bring what to<br/>\nthe Christmas party&gt;, penmanship &lt;keeping minutes&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nnext finishing up redecorating her room (physics &lt;working out why a nail<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go into a wall&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nnext bathing rabbits for a rabbit show tomorrow (health &lt;keeping them from<br/>\ngetting a chill&gt;, science &lt;quickest way to evaporate water out of rabbit<br/>\nfur&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that with one kid, zero planning, zero &quot;lessons&quot; and it is only 11:55am<br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49826,"nextTopicId":49872}}
