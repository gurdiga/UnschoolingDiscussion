We&#39;ll definitely give this a try. One of <br/>\nthe difficulties we have, though, with Kalie&#39;s (3 1/2) hitting/kicking, is <br/>\nthat while it&#39;s occasional and seems to go in spurts, it seems relatively <br/>\nunprovoked by the person she whacks. I&#39;ve seen her walk up to a playmate who <br/>\nhas been playing quietly, and kick them in in the heels for no apparent <br/>\nreason. She&#39;s great at sharing; I&#39;m right there, and she has my attention <br/>\nwhenever she wants it, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that.She&#39;s a pretty intense <br/>\nchild, and gets overexcited easily. She&#39;s very verbal, in general, but she&#39;s<br/>\nnever able to give a reason for this behavior. We&#39;ve been talking alot about <br/>\nfeelings to try to help her identify them, but she just gets angry after an <br/>\n&quot;incident&quot; if we ask too much about how she feels. Any more suggestions <br/>\nhere?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I&#39;ll just throw this question out. Does Kalie get enough attention and <br/>\none on one interaction with just you? I know you said she gets plenty of <br/>\nattention but I mean only you and her. I know it&#39;s hard, believe me with my <br/>\n4 it&#39;s hard to take the time for just me and one of them but my husband and <br/>\nI try very hard to do this often. Even if it&#39;s just a trip to the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso she sounds like she&#39;s just trying to rile someone up. Maybe she&#39;s bored <br/>\nand needs more stimulation? I&#39;m just talking out loud so if this isn&#39;t the <br/>\ncase, disregard!!! Maybe too, she is ahead of playing with her ages. Are <br/>\nthese kids her same age? I know my Alyssa (2) doesn&#39;t like to play with 2 <br/>\nyear old stuff and does much better with older kids. Then we she does get <br/>\naround younger ones, she has a tendency to play better because it&#39;s <br/>\ndifferent. But mostly she doesn&#39;t like to play like most 2 year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nInternet access plans that fit your lifestyle -- join MSN. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Subject: Urges to hit","postDate":"1035469667","msgId":47703,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5REQ3QkEyLkU3NUUlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyOS4xOTlhMTY4Ni4yYWU5NWE1N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47702,"nextInTopic":47724,"prevInTime":47702,"nextInTime":47704,"topicId":47702,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We talk, calmly, and I try to not only listen to both <br/>\nsides, but let them come up with solutions.<br/>\nSometimes a calm third party is all that&#39;s needed.<br/>\nIf someone loses their temper and hits, I immedietly comfort the victim and <br/>\ngo through the list of things we need to do BEFORE hitting becomes an option.<br/>\nFirst, we use words.<br/>\nIf that doesn&#39;t work, we call in a mediator (usually Mom or Dad) to help <br/>\nproblem solve.<br/>\nI explain to them that adults can&#39;t hit each other or they get in trouble <br/>\nwith the law, and that hitting makes people feel awful.<br/>\nLately, they&#39;ve been quick to feel sorry (without me telling them they <br/>\nshould!!) without all the guilt, blame and anger of previous times.<br/>\nI even apologized to my older son for some of the things that were done to <br/>\nhim and told him how wrong we were (once again) and that even though we did <br/>\nthings to make him very angry, I didn&#39;t want to perpetuate anger in our <br/>\nfamily and I couldn&#39;t tolerate anyone hitting anyone else because it makes <br/>\nour home an angry place, rather than peaceful.<br/>\nYesterday morning I read a quote by Deepak Chopra and they each chose a rock <br/>\n(a pile of rocks we keep for meditation purposes with words on them like <br/>\n&quot;strength&quot;, &quot;joy&quot; or &quot;peace&quot;) to hold. They choose ones that they feel they <br/>\nneed to focus on.<br/>\nI have found a peaceful beginning to the day, and a request for us all to <br/>\nfocus on making each other happy and doing nice things, really helps set the <br/>\ntone for the day.<br/>\nI find myself dialoguing a lot, but more trust developing between everyone.<br/>\nMore compassion, more problem solving skills and so on, are being noticed.<br/>\nNot that we don&#39;t have bad moments.....everyone does.<br/>\nBut I really believe that my calm awareness is going to make a huge <br/>\ndifference eventually.<br/>\nPatience is not my strength, but I&#39;m learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47209,"nextTopicId":47508}}
