Their religious beliefs now come from <br/>\nChristianity, not Judaism.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone was intending to state that a person can embrace <br/>\nJudaism and Christianity all at the same time.  I believe the <br/>\nmisunderstanding comes from the possible definitions of Jew:  <br/>\nreligious and ethnic.  An ethnic Jew (genetically speaking, born of a <br/>\nethnically Jewish mother) who has converted to Christianity is still <br/>\nan ethnic Jew, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my understanding of the phrases &quot;converted Jew&quot; or &quot;completed Jew&quot; <br/>\nis that they refer to ethnic Jews who are born-again Christians (from <br/>\na religious standpoint).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what Jews believe about being chosen, but Christians <br/>\nbelieve that ethnic Jews are a race that was/is chosen by God <br/>\n(Deuteronomy 7:6).  We also believe that when some Jews decided not <br/>\nto follow him or to believe that Jesus is the messiah, he added <br/>\nChristian believers to his chosen people (I Peter 2:9-10 and <br/>\nothers).  This is why Christians have (or should have) high respect <br/>\nfor the traditions of Judaism.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122926724,"authorName":"Rachel Ann","from":"Rachel Ann &lt;hindar@...&gt;","profile":"salixj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2508","postDate":"1035126847","msgId":46969,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWMyNzg0YiQ1NjBhZTRiMCQwZTg5NTI0M0BBbm9saWNrRmFtaWx5Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDJiLjJmMmYwYmQzLjJhZTQxZTI1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46964,"nextInTopic":47005,"prevInTime":46968,"nextInTime":46970,"topicId":46964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"LOL... great analogy!
