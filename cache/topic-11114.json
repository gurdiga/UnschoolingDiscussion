But that doesn&#39;t mean I approve of that. I<br/>\nsee it as a sad part of me that needs working on. I could send in jokes that put<br/>\ndown women, or Americans, or Poms (does that word make you cringe slightly, Dawn?<br/>\n- it would if you lived in NZ) - we have plenty of all of these circulating in NZ<br/>\n- or put down christians, buddhists or atheists, but the fact that I send them<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean it is right to do so. I value the input of the men on this list as<br/>\nmuch as I do that of the women. David Albert in particular has been an inspiration<br/>\nto me - and after 14 years of homeschooling experience of my own, there aren&#39;t an<br/>\nawful lot of people that inspire me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Charles didn&#39;t say &#39;general chit chat&#39;, he said &#39;general chat list&#39;, which<br/>\nto my way of thinking has quite a different meaning to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that someone has objected to sexist jokes. I know this is an<br/>\nunmoderated list, but can&#39;t we just accept Charles&#39; objection and let it lie? Or<br/>\nare we going to make the list open slather for every kind of &#39;ist&#39; joke around?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\ndressing in flame-proof clothing, aware that after being up almost all night<br/>\nwatching the total eclipse of the moon that she isn&#39;t thinking or typing too<br/>\nclearly - eg, I first wrote &#39;total eclipse of the men&#39;!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NumoAstro@...\">NumoAstro@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; In a message dated 7/16/2000 9:34:15 AM US Mountain Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Charles.Dewar@...\">Charles.Dewar@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Oh, well.
