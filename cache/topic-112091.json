And I am on the outside looking in. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else have fiercly independant children that resist oversight?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess here would be a good place for an example story huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a month ago she demanded she be allowed to bake cookies for some<br/>\nnew neighbors in our cul de sac. I really didn&#39;t feel like stopping<br/>\neverything I was doing at that moment to bake cookies plus baking<br/>\nresources were low and there are other issues like we live with my<br/>\nparents so it&#39;s not my kitchen...lol sigh<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I pointed her to cook books, and told her we had no butter. She<br/>\nfinds a recipe that did not require butter and set everything up.<br/>\n<br/>\nApple Raisin Oatmeal Cookies <br/>\n<br/>\nI told her to pre cook the apple chunks rather than just adding them<br/>\nto the batter for a bit of a different taste and feel of them in the<br/>\nfinished product and was free to come and survey by the time she told<br/>\nme they were finished and she was almost done with the rest of the batter.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have baked a lot in our life time but she has mostly helped or<br/>\nwatched until now. So I told her to keep things simple and follow the<br/>\nrecipe/instructions.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlancing at the apples which were covered in brown sugar and cinnamon<br/>\nso I couldn&#39;t see clearly what shape they were in. It became apparent<br/>\nthat they were not soft and tender...what&#39;s more they were chopped<br/>\nnicely but they were not peeled! lol<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I mentioned that to her she was shocked. She hadn&#39;t read that<br/>\npart and hadn&#39;t realized that it&#39;s what I always do when chopping<br/>\napples for oatmeal and other things we add them to for baking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk so we start a new batch of apples and I tell her how to test and<br/>\nmake sure they are soft.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all it was a decent experience the cookies came out lovely and<br/>\nshe had a good time she was in control and all I did was help with the<br/>\napples.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few weeks later she wants to make cookies again. But this time she<br/>\nwants to wing her own version of chocolate cookies. Again I mention<br/>\nthis is not my kitchen and I&#39;ll add my mother is extremely neat and<br/>\ntidy where I am more relaxed. So the pressure is on to put her kitchen<br/>\nback the way she likes it in a very timely manner and we are talking<br/>\nchocolate here eke!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain I am not totally in a baking mood so this is my dd&#39;s idea and I<br/>\nam sort of just along for the ride. She wants none of referencing her<br/>\nidea for a cookie recipe with an already established one and I want<br/>\nnone of her experiementing in my mothers kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe agree she will write out her recipe for starters.
