After a forest  fire in Yellowstone<br/>\nNational<br/>\n&gt; Park, Forest Rangers began their trek up a  mountain to assess the<br/>\n&gt; inferno&#39;s damage.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One ranger found a bird  literally petrified in ashes perched statuesquely<br/>\n&gt; on the ground at the base of a tree.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Somewhat sickened by the eerie sight, he knocked over the bird with  a<br/>\n&gt; stick. When he gently struck it, three tiny chicks scurried from under<br/>\n&gt; their dead  mother&#39;s wings. The loving mother, keenly aware of impending<br/>\n&gt; disaster, had carried her offspring to the base of the tree and had<br/>\n&gt; gathered them under<br/>\n&gt; her wings, instinctively knowing that the toxic  smoke would rise. She<br/>\n&gt; could have flown to safety but had refused to abandon her babies.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When the blaze had arrived and the heat had  scorched her small body, the<br/>\n&gt; mother had remained steadfast. Because she  had been willing to die, those<br/>\n&gt; under the cover her wings would live. &quot;He will cover you with his<br/>\nfeathers,<br/>\n&gt; and under his wings you will find  refuge.&quot; (Psalm  91:4).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Being loved this much should make a difference in your  life. Remember the<br/>\n&gt; One who loves you and then be different because of it. A Thought: Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; travel faster than your Guardian Angel can fly. I leave you in the arms of<br/>\n&gt; Jesus,  Psalm 139,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6471,"nextTopicId":6493}}
