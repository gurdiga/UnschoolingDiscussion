One mom was recently bragging how she was planning <br/>\non starting &quot;lessons&quot; on Tuesday, but her kids had taken out their <br/>\nschool books and were sitting at the kitchen table insisting they <br/>\nstart today. &lt;Gag&gt; I don&#39;t know whether to admire these children or <br/>\nto feel sorry for them.  I also don&#39;t know whether to believe her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would seriously be worried if my kids acted like that.  That can&#39;t <br/>\nbe normal.  Has she turned them into little robots, or were they <br/>\nborn that way? <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is also doing her &quot;lessons plans&quot; for next month when they will <br/>\nbe in the Carribean.  They will be taking most of their school <br/>\nbooks. &lt;double gag&gt;  Poor kids.  They won&#39;t know what to do with <br/>\nthemselves in the Carribean unless mom is spoonfeeding them some <br/>\ngrammar exercises.  Sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same mom has critized unschooling in the past. <br/>\n<br/>\nI unsubscribed from that list.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d come and post here to people who I know will <br/>\nunderstand.  I love this list.  It is such an inspiration to me, I <br/>\nlove my free-spirited, self-motivated, creative children.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110445,"nextTopicId":110119}}
