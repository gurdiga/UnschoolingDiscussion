She&#39;s old, very frail, and they&#39;re afraid it&#39;s only a <br/>\nmatter of time now. Mark wants to be able to be there within hours, <br/>\nso I&#39;m flying to Alaska tomorrow evening. If he needs to fly to <br/>\nMichigan I&#39;ll meet him back in Seattle en route...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe adventure can wait. If my Dad weren&#39;t also in rough shape I&#39;d <br/>\nprobably not go at all, but my brothers advised me that it would <br/>\nreally be good for Dad to spend some time with me, and Mark agrees. <br/>\nAs the oldest I think he relies on me for a lot sometimes. Not more <br/>\nthan any of the other kids, but in different ways. My sister says Dad <br/>\nkeeps saying he has important stuff to talk to me about and frets <br/>\nthat he won&#39;t get the chance. Not the kind of stuff you can put in a <br/>\nphone conversation, the kind of stuff you take a long drive into the <br/>\nmountains for... At least that&#39;s how we do it in our family when we <br/>\nneed to connect on certain levels. We go out into the mountains, <br/>\nwhere it&#39;s quiet and the only distractions are the incredible beauty <br/>\nof a sunset or the northern lights. They can be awesome this time of <br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway. Just thought I&#39;d pop over and check the digest for my <br/>\nfavorite list. Found out last night that yesterday was the list&#39;s <br/>\nthird birthday: it was created April 11, 1999! Cool, eh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Unschooling is what grownups do, all the time.

Our good friend John Taylor Gatto explains <br/>\nthat schools aren&#39;t failing, they&#39;re succeeding quite nicely at what <br/>\nthey were created to do:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.johntaylorgatto.com\">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34545,"nextTopicId":34577}}
