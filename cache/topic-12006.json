Michelle also came up with<br/>\neczema last year and her cheeks were covered with red patches especially<br/>\nafter dinner every day.  Our Naturopath is helping with the allergies. <br/>\nMichelle has had one treatment on the NAET program.  I&#39;ll be darned if her<br/>\nspeech didn&#39;t improve some the very next morning.  We still have 11<br/>\ntreatments to go.  maybe it will make a big difference in her communication<br/>\nskills more as we continue ridding her of those allergies.  I hope so.  She<br/>\nsure is a miserable kid.  :(<br/>\nBut just with the one treatment, the eczema is barely noticable anymore. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings to you,<br/>\n<br/>\nKandice<br/>\nIf I could show you how to make $300-$800+ mo. part-time at home with no selling, inventory,or huge <br/>\nstart-up cost, would you like to hear about it?

She can&#39;t<br/>\ndraw a line from the &quot;A&quot; to the &quot;B&quot; or put a circle on the &quot;B&quot; or tell me if<br/>\nthere are two balls or three.<br/>\nShe can&#39;t really make a sentence yet.  We can&#39;t particularly communicate<br/>\nwith her because she doesn&#39;t understand much of what we say unless we use<br/>\nthe very few words in her vocabulary.<br/>\nWhen she talks, we often can figure out what she wants but just as often, we<br/>\ncan&#39;t.<br/>\nShe spends a lot of her time throwing fits of frustration and being stubborn<br/>\nabout everything and anything.<br/>\nShe was raised as a baby very lovingly by both me and my husband.  She was<br/>\nvery pampered and never left to cry.  We just loved her to death.  But she<br/>\nstarted acting this way at about 3 years old and I wonder if she isn&#39;t<br/>\nautistic to some degree.  I have heard that this usually occurs at about 3<br/>\nyears.<br/>\nSince that time, she has gone from being our very sweet loving baby to being<br/>\nvery difficult for anyone in the family to live with.  She spends a lot of<br/>\nher time screaming at siblings.<br/>\nIf the kids take her outside for a walk, it becomes a big long screaming fit<br/>\nfor Michelle who isn&#39;t happy with anything at all particularly if it<br/>\ninvolves the word &quot;no&quot;.  If we try to play with her, she is very likely to<br/>\ngrunt loudly at us defiantly and refuse to co-operate in anything.<br/>\nI just don&#39;t know what to do with her.<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect her to be like the gifted son and be a super child in her<br/>\nabilities, but it would be nice if there was at least reasonable ability to<br/>\ncommunicate with her.  I don&#39;t know how to work with her and help her and<br/>\nthere isn&#39;t a way to explain anything to her that she is upset and screaming<br/>\nabout.<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean to be one of those mothers who labels her kid and has too much<br/>\nexpectation.  I just don&#39;t know if everything is okay with her or not.  If<br/>\nmore time and freedom to do her own thing is all she needs, that would be<br/>\ngreat.  She is free to have it here.  I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case<br/>\nand am worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings to you,<br/>\n<br/>\nKandice<br/>\nIf I could show you how to make $300-$800+ mo. part-time at home with no selling, inventory,or huge <br/>\nstart-up cost, would you like to hear about it?
