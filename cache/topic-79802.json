Talk to her about the difference between what were <br/>\nonce called &quot;soft sciences&quot; (psychology and sociology and I don&#39;t know what <br/>\nelse) and &quot;hard sciences&quot; (meaning concrete, not difficult).  Astronomy came <br/>\nunder &quot;hard science&quot; even though nobody&#39;s brought any of those planets home, and <br/>\neven before the lunar landing it was &quot;hard&quot; while any study of people was <br/>\n&quot;soft.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat could tie psychology in with history and philosophy for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The real issue is peer related. I think teens have such a strong <br/>\n<br/>\nneed to feel that they idenitfy with their peer group, that they are <br/>\n<br/>\non the right track&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re lucky in having a fair number of other kids who have always or mostly <br/>\nor sometimes been homeschooled, AND some unschoolers among that number.  We&#39;re <br/>\nlucky that of the homeschooled in that group, unschoolers are doing the best <br/>\nsocially and jobwise.  It&#39;s through La Leche League that we met some, and <br/>\nthrough running an unschooling get-together once a week that we have some more <br/>\nstill in our lives, and it&#39;s due to Marty&#39;s Ork Ball games that they&#39;re over here <br/>\npretty regularly these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nA family from Tucson was visiting the other day.  They came by to buy <br/>\nThinking Sticks!  (Well, they were in town anyway. &lt;bwg&gt;)   A carload of Ork Ball <br/>\nplayers showed up and I introduced them, and it was not as fun for me as it would <br/>\nhave been a few months back.  Two of them have gone to school this year.  <br/>\nJulie, who had never been to school at all is fifteen and a dancer, and applied <br/>\nto get into the public school of performing arts which just opened three years <br/>\nago or so.  Logan who has been in and out of school is living rurally now with <br/>\nhis mom&#39;s fiancee and his children, quite a schooled family, and he&#39;s going <br/>\nto high school because the bus gets him into Albuquerque every day and he&#39;s not <br/>\nout where he&#39;s expected to watch younger kids.  Practical considerations and <br/>\nthe need for an audience on his part, and a lack of confidence or interest in <br/>\nhomeschooling on his mom&#39;s.   But until a few weeks ago, I could have said <br/>\n&quot;homeschooled, homeschooled... &quot; all the way around the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if Kirby didn&#39;t have a batch of homeschooled friends he&#39;d be wanting to <br/>\n&quot;keep up&quot; with his schooled friends too, instead of seeing how far ahead of <br/>\nthem he is in so many ways that the few &quot;behinds&quot; seem small.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Aaarrrrgggghhh!","postDate":"1062675301","msgId":79850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCN0M5QkE1LjFERUJBJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWMzNzIyYiQyY2UwZGM0MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":79840,"nextInTopic":79863,"prevInTime":79849,"nextInTime":79851,"topicId":79802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What does Lars like to do?

She wants me to be involved, <br/>\nto help her create goals that fit into categories for college <br/>\nadmissions and to hold her accountable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means the dreaded study of algebra when her times tables <br/>\naren&#39;t solid and neither of us see any point to learning it. When <br/>\nmy husband and I have emphasized that learning something for <br/>\na requirement isn&#39;t the same as learning, she says that it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter. She needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I am giving my time to helping her follow a curricula. <br/>\nShe *needs* to give this route a try and I want to support her, not <br/>\nbe a roadblock. But it taxes me and I don&#39;t wholeheartedly <br/>\nsupport the direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real issue is peer related. I think teens have such a strong <br/>\nneed to feel that they idenitfy with their peer group, that they are <br/>\non the right track (adulthood is a scary future for everyoneto <br/>\ndoubt that you are prepared to do anything is an awful feeling) <br/>\nand that they are secure in their parents&#39; value system and <br/>\nchoices that influence their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m thinking of asking him what specific things<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he feels he&#39;s missing, but I suspect all I&#39;ll get is, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My two who want to &quot;study&quot; say that they want me to know. They <br/>\nwant me to tell them what they&#39;ll need. It feels like too big a job to <br/>\nfigure it out themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my 6th grader, we are still following his interests and <br/>\ncreating goals that he wants to achieve. So he&#39;s cooking through <br/>\na cookbook and writing up all the recipes, studying the <br/>\nconstellations and looking for them in his telescope etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for my 14 year old, we pulled out a typical college <br/>\nadmissions subject list and pulled from that. She says she <br/>\nwants science so we looked at all the sciences. She likes <br/>\npsychology so I suggested she do a temperament study of her <br/>\npeer group. I helped her lay out the daily steps, I gave her <br/>\nreading and due dates and I helped her imagine the end result. <br/>\nHaving a manageable goal that is tangible (but nothing like text <br/>\nbook work) made her feel that she too had important work to do <br/>\nthat was parallel to school without being school.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s also being tutored in Latin (her idea) and is taking French <br/>\nand honor&#39;s English at the local high school (to see what it&#39;s <br/>\nlike). She already hated the French class even though she loves <br/>\nlanguages. It&#39;s been eye opening to her to see what school is <br/>\nlike. She&#39;s already valuing hom and our freedom a lot more. She <br/>\nloves her English class though. She likes having class <br/>\ndiscussions about her primary love: literature.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was missing this last spring in her opinion was guidance <br/>\nfrom me. She feels loved when I take the time to plan with her <br/>\nand take her concerns seriously. This is how we&#39;re doing it. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; really feels like he wants to be told what to do, to follow a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>curriculum,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and it seems to be about being like everyone else rather than <br/>\n </span></blockquote>any desire to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learn.

Maybe he just needs <br/>\nsome time to sort through how he wants his last two or three <br/>\nyears to look before college (if college in in his sights). If he has <br/>\na plan (and it includes cool stuff, not GED prep), he won&#39;t miss <br/>\nthat curricula stuff.
