I just wanted to take a moment to introduce<br/>\nmyself.<br/>\nSome of you may remember me from before, but since it&#39;s<br/>\nbeen a<br/>\ngood while since I was on the list I thought I should<br/>\nintroduce again :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Jacli and my husband Marco and I have a 12 year<br/>\nold<br/>\ndaughter, Larissa.  We&#39;ve been unschoolers since she was<br/>\nborn.<br/>\nWhile Marco had no experience with unschooling either in<br/>\nItaly <br/>\nor here, I am an Army brat and have had multiple schooling<br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\nMy father was career military and traveled to wherever<br/>\nwhenever.  My<br/>\nmother had children because she was expected to and used<br/>\nwhatever<br/>\nschooling was nearby to alleviate her burden.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nattended just about<br/>\nevery type of school there is.  I loved Montessori but it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t til I became<br/>\nvery ill in High School and had to stay home for a year (in<br/>\nthe midst of <br/>\nqualifying for early graduation) that I found out about<br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\nI had a tutor who believed very strongly in what I now know<br/>\nwas actually<br/>\nunschooling.  It was absolutely the best thing that could<br/>\nhave happened to me.<br/>\nWhen our daughter was born there was never any question in<br/>\nmy mind that<br/>\nthat would be best for her as well.  Marco on the other<br/>\nhand, well, the jury is<br/>\nstill out as far as he is concerned.  We have days he is<br/>\nconvinced that homeschooling<br/>\nis best and others when he wonders aloud why he ever let me<br/>\ntalk him into it.  He<br/>\nis more rigidly inclined than I am and actually prefers<br/>\nhomeschooling - I grew up<br/>\nwith super rigid household and I prefer un-schooling.  But<br/>\nwe make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil today he worked in New York Monday -Friday, staying<br/>\nat our Manhattan apt.<br/>\nand came home to our South Florida apt. on the weekends.<br/>\nAnd until Sept. 11<br/>\nwe (Larissa and I) pretty much spent equal time in New<br/>\nYork.  Now as of today<br/>\nwe are full time in Florida.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are pretty much loners and tend to pagan ways of<br/>\nthinking.  I am a former actress<br/>\nand model and am actually getting back into it.  I own an<br/>\nHerbalife business and used<br/>\nthe products to go from a size 26 to a 10 and get off 14<br/>\ndaily medications so as you can<br/>\nimagine I am VERY health and nutrition minded.  I also do<br/>\nvoice overs and Larissa has <br/>\nbeen modeling and acting since she was a baby.  We just<br/>\nmoved to Florida a year ago<br/>\nand we are still making adjustments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, now that I have told you way more than you could<br/>\npossibly want to know<br/>\nI guess that about does it.  I am very excited to be back<br/>\non the list again and looking forward<br/>\nto meeting all the &quot;new&quot; people.  I am pretty outspoken but<br/>\nI will always try to be considerate<br/>\nto everyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening, Jacli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27223,"nextTopicId":26977}}
