What children want and need is to be able to  <br/>\ndepend on their parents to meet their needs. Everything else from  <br/>\nkids&#39; points of view is parents doing what they want to do. Whether it  <br/>\nbe mowing the lawn, going to work, grocery shopping, getting a degree.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s all the same to kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s important to kids is that they don&#39;t feel their needs dropping  <br/>\nto second place for the parents&#39; needs. Which is important in any  <br/>\nrelationship. If a husband or wife keeps breaking dates, forgetting to  <br/>\npick something up at the grocery, forgetting birthdays because of all  <br/>\nthis other stuff going on in their lives, the actions say &quot;You&#39;re way  <br/>\ndown on my priority list.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *is* valuable for kids to experience parents balancing meeting  <br/>\ntheir own needs while keeping the kids needs as a priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, no, it&#39;s not important for kids to see parents meeting their  <br/>\ngoals. Your kids are older so you doing your thing may have less  <br/>\nnegative impact on them. Your 17 yo may think it&#39;s cool since he&#39;s at  <br/>\nan age when he may be thinking along the same lines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He has approached me and decided to get his math up to grade level.  <br/>\n&gt; No problem there, there are enough texts lieing about and so he has  <br/>\n&gt; started all ready and is very determined.

What does he want better  <br/>\nEnglish for? And what does he mean by English? Literature? Grammar?  <br/>\nCommunication? It will help you narrow down your search if you can  <br/>\nidentify exactly what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe requests seem to be coming from a schoolish mindset. So if he&#39;s  <br/>\nexpecting a schoolish process and schoolish results, eg, do this, this  <br/>\nand this and you&#39;ll have done what you need to do, an unschooling  <br/>\nforum isn&#39;t the best place to ask!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it seems unschoolers would be a great resource for self- <br/>\ndirected approaches to learning, but most unschooled kids aren&#39;t using  <br/>\nprograms. (There is the occasional unschooled kid who does love  <br/>\ncourses so sometimes members do come up with something!) But the  <br/>\neclectics, who tend to be more laid back while using a wide variety of  <br/>\nprograms, would be a much better resource. They&#39;ve done the research  <br/>\nand exploration. Unschoolers only do it if they happen to have a kid  <br/>\nwho pushes them in that direction!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if there might be writing (or is it grammar he wants?)  <br/>\nprograms for the visually impaired?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My youngest daughter. Taught herself to write<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless she was going through a self-paced course of study it&#39;s more  <br/>\naccurate to see that she is learning to write by writing. It sounds  <br/>\nlike a quibble, but &quot;taught&quot; tends to keep people thinking in terms of  <br/>\nacquiring a specific body of knowledge, which makes them tend to think  <br/>\nin terms of courses of study.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the concept of learning is vast, takes all sorts of shapes and  <br/>\nforms and is never ending.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point your daughter may know very little about the  <br/>\ncommunication type of writing that your son sounds like he&#39;s  <br/>\ninterested in: writing that transfers ideas from one person&#39;s head  <br/>\ninto another person&#39;s head. So in those terms she hasn&#39;t taught  <br/>\nherself to write nor even learned to write for communication. What she  <br/>\nwrote may be fairly unreadable to anyone else. (And it&#39;s not important  <br/>\nif it is or isn&#39;t!) (I know my daughter&#39;s NaNoWriMo at 14 was a pretty  <br/>\nsurreal wild ride for her characters ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s important is that your daughter had the freedom to do something  <br/>\nshe enjoyed doing. That the side effect of doing what she enjoyed  <br/>\ncreated something that adults see as valuable is irrelevant. What  <br/>\nshe&#39;s doing is exactly what other kids are doing when they explore  <br/>\nanything with driving interest whether it be beating a video game,  <br/>\nnailing a song on the guitar, acting out a convoluted (to adults ;-)  <br/>\nscenario with Barbies.

BUT they have asked for some things which I don&#39;t know what to suggest and hope you can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome background. we have homeschooled/unschooled from the beginning. My children have never been in a school. My 19 year old is in College (and doing great, thank-you!), I have a 17 year old son and a 14 year old daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son does programing, composing, and teaches children to kayak and DJ&#39;s on friday nights. He has approached me and decided to get his math up to grade level. No problem there, there are enough texts lieing about and so he has started all ready and is very determined. But he also asked for something to help him with English. He has never enjoyed reading (he is right brained & very visually impaired) so about the only reading he likes are Graphic novels. Until now he has only writen on forums and facebook on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he has asked me to help him with getting his writing skills up to a decent level. NOW. When I will not even be home for long periodso f time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am asking for suggestions. Is there a &quot;remedial&quot; type of program that you know of and can recommend? An online site with guided writing instruction. Something that can teach the basics without killing the subject?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest daughter also hated writing when she was younger. When she was 16 she took a one week course called excellence in writing. In her first year in College she got an A+ (and an award) in Canadian Literature and a B+ in Academic writing. So  I fully believe that you don&#39;t need years of any subject to go to college. You just need to want to do it. The excellence in writing wouldn&#39;t be a good course for my son, because it was very intense, and he can only focus on the written word for short periods of time before he gets headaches (he has colobomas in both eyes and sees very poorly).. so I would like something he could do at his own pace..Any ideas?. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest daughter.
