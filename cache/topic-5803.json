gets older (he&#39;s really into robots and is demanding to build a metal<br/>\none , which he&#39;s already designed- i know nothing about robotics).<br/>\n<br/>\nwe all share a bed - we have one 4 yo son, rene&#39; (second on the way due in<br/>\naug/sept so i&#39;m in the throws of morning sickness - yuck)  and we&#39;ve spent<br/>\nvery little time apart.  a few years ago - when rene&#39; was 20 months i<br/>\nacquired an autoimmune disease &#39;still&#39;s disease&#39; (akin to rheumatoid<br/>\narthritis and lupus) which destroyed virtually all the muscles in my<br/>\nshoulders (i couldn&#39;t hold him or change a diaper for over 3 months).  this<br/>\nwas believed to be a side effected of a vaccine i had been given in &#39;89 and<br/>\nappears to have finally gone after 2 1/2 years.   we have no family in the<br/>\narea and were relatively new here and had virtually no friends (we left<br/>\nthem all in northern cal).   anyway the reason i&#39;m telling you this is to<br/>\nsay that any situation is conducive to homeschooling.  some situations may<br/>\nappear harder than others but when you accept the situation as you<br/>\nexperience it, you can begin to find its own particular strengths.<br/>\n<br/>\npersonally i would have loved something different and have gone through<br/>\nlong periods of doubt, self pity, guilt... you name it,  but recently i&#39;ve<br/>\nrealized the strengths and gifts that came along with our particular<br/>\nreality.  we are still judged by some family members - mostly my husband&#39;s<br/>\nbecause they have a lot invested in the ps system and because we are pretty<br/>\nclear and well versed and can not only hold our ground but really offer up<br/>\nsome good solid arguments for homeschooling and this annoys them.   i see<br/>\nthese judgments as their short coming because they allow society to make<br/>\ntheir decision for them rather than do the research and choose for<br/>\nthemselves ( i love options:) - a sad state of affairs in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nas far as isolation goes you may need to do that for a little while just to<br/>\nmake the complete change - you know, clean out all those sneaky unconscious<br/>\nbeliefs stuck in the far recesses of your mind:) and find out what you want<br/>\nfor your own family.  life is noisy and sometimes we need to take a break<br/>\nso we can have our own thoughts without all the fears and doubts expressed<br/>\nby those around us.  i think people can be truly happy in any situation<br/>\nbecause happiness - to me - is about love and when you have that for<br/>\nyourself then everything else is fine and very workable because then you<br/>\ncan be creative and that is at the heart of unschooling.   but take it one<br/>\nstep at a time and don&#39;t give yourself a &#39;report card&#39; just watch and enjoy<br/>\nand indulge, and what you and your family needs and wants will show itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin, tx</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Mara Winders","from":"Mara Winders &lt;mwinders@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xplhoWE8dTC48qtFxue_KouVuzDkNr1IvZvo24HfYKV5J4wTx6_0IPh--Z52s5TM6SLY219BElYZry6D-m3CBeK_ccpezX6gtvyt","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New list member","postDate":"948940135","msgId":5822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zODQuNTgyMi45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5817,"nextInTopic":6067,"prevInTime":5821,"nextInTime":5823,"topicId":5803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve never heard of Taffie - where can I find out more?
