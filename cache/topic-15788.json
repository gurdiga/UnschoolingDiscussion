So, I<br/>\n&gt; was wondering if anyone could give me some websites, info, personal<br/>\n&gt; viewpoints...whatever. Either pro or con vaccine, although there is <br/>\n&gt; already lots of<br/>\n&gt; pro-vaccine information out there.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1190025438\">I rarely post but need some information. I&#39;m due to have my 3rd child next <br/>\nmonth and my husband and I are negotiating what will we do about immunizations. <br/>\nI was alone when I had my first two children and did follow the recommended <br/>\nshot schedule because that&#39;s what I was told to do. I&#39;ve grown up since then and <br/>\nmy 2nd child who is now 7 missed out on his last dpt and whatever other shots <br/>\nthey get before school, which wasn&#39;t a big deal since he has never attended <br/>\nschool. My husband thinks that if we don&#39;t follow the exact guidelines our baby <br/>\nwill succumb to some awful disease and I&#39;ll be sorry. I understand he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave same views as I do on many things and am willing to possibly see about <br/>\nat least delaying the immunizations. His sister has not immunized her 2 yr old <br/>\nyet, either but he still is uncomfortable about going against the norm. So, I <br/>\nwas wondering if anyone could give me some websites, info, personal <br/>\nviewpoints...whatever. Either pro or con vaccine, although there is already lots of <br/>\npro-vaccine information out there. I do ask for this cautiously, I do not want to <br/>\nstir up any debate. Feel free to email me off-list if you choose. Also, we <br/>\nhave Kaiser as our insurance and I was also wondering if anyone here had any <br/>\nexperience with them, especially in regard to immunizations. I&#39;m afraid they will <br/>\ninsist on following the immunization schedule exactly.  Thanks in advance for <br/>\nyour help.<br/>\nRegina <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Immunizations","postDate":"1031849930","msgId":43802,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWMyNWE3ZCRiOWEzNjQyMCQxODgwZWU0MEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMzE4MzQ0NjAuMTQxMC42MDUxNi5tMTFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15857,"nextInTopic":77413,"prevInTime":43801,"nextInTime":43803,"topicId":15788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1129544555\">&lt;&lt;I live in Texas and don&#39;t know anyone here in the country that<br/>\n&quot;unschools.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHello from another Texas unschooler<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie----waving from the Hill Country</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"PgtFJtnptUOdhv3sovIFgjeAdK0mLvuGbF_6oeZvPf-PK_XwzmW2ZeNJlKyJ8CQMzbvqEqLfR-F07JE57vNfvo6prQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Immunizations","postDate":"981220619","msgId":15857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNTQwMWMwOGUwNiQxNWNkNTRlMCQ5ZTVkZDFkMUBsZGlvbm5vPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwMjAyLjEzMzE1MS4tMTQxNzU1LjEubWVnYXRlc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15788,"nextInTopic":43802,"prevInTime":15856,"nextInTime":15858,"topicId":15788,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This isn t quite correct.
