I DID <br/>\nbelieve in him with all my heart, and that made him very real to me.    <br/>\nSomehow, my mother played the &quot;Santa&quot; card just right.. lol, and I was never <br/>\nleft with feelings of being decieved.  I know lots of folks think its not <br/>\nright to &quot;lie&quot; to kids about Santa, but to me, it was not a lie, he was <br/>\nreally REAL as long as I believed in him.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll just throw this out for whatever it&#39;s worth........... The whole lying <br/>\nabout Santa thing didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t sit right with me either. (How can your kids <br/>\nreally trust you after lying to them for so long about something?) On the <br/>\nother hand, I didn&#39;t want to take away something so fun to a child. (And <br/>\nthere&#39;s lots of people who trust their parents who lied to them about Santa. <br/>\nMaybe if all else is in order, lying about Santa will be *understood*.) <br/>\nSoooooo, with all that in mind, this is what I came up with. (It&#39;s a fine <br/>\nline, I know, but it sounds good to me, so I&#39;m crossing my fingers it&#39;ll be <br/>\nok. It *feels* like it will be.) Whenever &quot;Santa&quot; comes up in conversation <br/>\n(usually around xmas time), I Make Sure to use the word &quot;MAGIC&quot; (as in that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat he is, AND in explaning what/how he does things). (This last xmas, I <br/>\nheard from my oldest -8- &quot;I KNOW mommy, he&#39;s Magic&quot; as in I said it one too <br/>\nmany times I guess &lt;g&gt;.) Sooooo, whenever we talk about &quot;magic&quot;, EXCEPT when <br/>\ntalking about Santa (like David Copperfield, or things in movies, or the <br/>\nmagic tricks their Uncle does, or Whatever), I THEN Make Sure to say &quot;magic <br/>\nis pretend&quot;. So; whenever &quot;magic&quot; comes up, I say &quot;pretend&quot;, and whenever <br/>\n&quot;Santa&quot; comes up, I say &quot;magic&quot;. That way, whenever it comes out that Santa <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really exist, it shouldn&#39;t sound so much like a &quot;lie&quot;, because <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been told all along that &quot;magic is pretend&quot;. I&#39;m even thinking that <br/>\nthey might even just put two&two together on their own, as in &quot;magic is <br/>\npretend, we know Santa is magic, therefore Santa is pretend&quot; kind-of-thing. <br/>\nAND, if/when ever point blank asked, no matter what age, I WILL NOT lie about <br/>\nhim actually being real. THAT, IMO, is a mistake. I hope all that makes <br/>\nsense.  Lara...........</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64822,"nextTopicId":64813}}
