I love the tone, and I love <br/>\nthe format, and it&#39;s all the information people had to read for years to <br/>\ngather, years ago, and from now on can get from that book.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Rue Kream is ready to take orders for her new book. She&#39;s not<br/>\ncomfortable blowing her own horn, but *I* am delighted to! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEntitled _Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life_, it is in a Q&A<br/>\nformat where Rue answers most, if not all &lt;g&gt;, of the questions we all<br/>\nhave heard or will hear as unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a sweet, gentle book---just like Rue!
