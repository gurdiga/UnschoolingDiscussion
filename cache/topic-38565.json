Many people whose children are still","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-300263624\">Group, <br/>\n<br/>\nLately there have been many posts that have referred more to parenting<br/>\nconcerns than schooling (or unschooling). Many people whose children are<br/>\nstill under five seem to believe that they need to start in on some sort of<br/>\nschooling, even UNschooling, whatever that might be to them, when what they<br/>\nare mostly asking about needs to be understood/seen as parenting, not<br/>\nschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren need decent (or, if possible, excellent) parenting. Some of the<br/>\ncomments I&#39;ve read here reveal that many parents today need parenting<br/>\nthemselves AND definitely need parenting training. For that, I suggest going<br/>\nto your library and get the help that your own parents did not provide for<br/>\nyou on how to raise a small child. Years ago, Luz and I read &quot;Parent<br/>\nEffectiveness Training (PET) and learned a lot. There surely are many new<br/>\nbooks that can help with the fundamentals of getting along with and caring<br/>\nfor our own small kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren&#39;s needs are amazingly basic, but are urgent. They need to know that<br/>\nsomeone is protecting them from harm, hunger, cold, falling out of windows,<br/>\ngetting stuck in things, etc. After that (once they feel safe), their need<br/>\nis to PLAY. Play is a child&#39;s way of finding out about the world. Schooling<br/>\ndoes not provide that knowledge, so the main thing after basic maintenance<br/>\nis play. Therefore, when parents have got the maintenance down, they simply<br/>\nneed to take the next step for their child: Providing (safe) access to the<br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Scout:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scoutpayne@...\">scoutpayne@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked (in 2124) for resources to help you begin to unschool. Understand<br/>\nthat unschooling is usually a practice of NOT doing schooling... Unschooling<br/>\nis not a &quot;technique&quot; of schooling. It is THE ABSENSE of schooling. Once we<br/>\nlearn the real dangers and deficits of doing schooling to children, then we<br/>\ncan begin to learn how to raise a child so that s/he takes charge of his/her<br/>\nown learning, and we can simply stand by and help with access and admire the<br/>\nprocess.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuz and I have put together a packet of info for parents who wish to<br/>\nunschool their kids. If you&#39;d like the whole thing, send an email and we<br/>\nwill return it to you right away.  If you just want the list of books that<br/>\nwe believe are helpful (helped us raise our son) here is that excerpt from<br/>\nthe packet: <br/>\n<br/>\nSUGGESTED READING<br/>\nJohn Holt:  Teach Your Own,  How Children Learn,  Escape From Childhood,<br/>\nLearning All The Time, A Life Worth Living,  Instead of Education,  Never<br/>\nToo Late,  Freedom and Beyond<br/>\nThomas Armstrong: In Their own Way  and The Myth of the A.D.D.

They don&#39;t need to be made to learn or shown how. Recently,<br/>\nsomeone wrote that Kids are HARDWIRED to learn. We agree strongly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also believe that discipline is something children have at birth, it is<br/>\nnot something that needs to be taught, let alone pounded into a child. I<br/>\nbelieve that those who use the word &quot;discipline&quot; to describe what they do to<br/>\ntheir children, should use the word &quot;punish&quot; instead. I do not believe that<br/>\nchildren are &quot;spoiled&quot; by good care and/or kindness, ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Scout&#39;s other question, about family and friends who will not<br/>\nunderstand. ---- Since your child is still far from &quot;school age&quot; there is<br/>\ntime to prepare those people for what you&#39;ll be doing. First, if they don&#39;t<br/>\nsupport you, they&#39;re not your friends (family or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, your job is to fully understand what you&#39;re doing yourself. If<br/>\nyou&#39;re sure about your own practice, it will show to everyone and there<br/>\nshould be much less of a problem and less need to explain the details. A few<br/>\nof the basic facts are these: Going to school is a waste of valuable time;<br/>\nSchool does not educate, it indoctrinates; there is very little that&#39;s<br/>\ntaught in school, and even less that&#39;s learned -- most learning happens<br/>\noutside of schools; the biggest lesson that schools teach is &quot;You are not a<br/>\ngood learner!&quot;  Another strong lesson is this: Your opinions and needs are<br/>\nnot important, so sit down and be quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce your &quot;friends and family&quot; learn some of those facts, they might see<br/>\nthings more in your way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more, go to www.borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>\n<br/>\nREAD, READ<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, Ned Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38411,"nextTopicId":38645}}
