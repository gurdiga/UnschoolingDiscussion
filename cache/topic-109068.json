It sounded a lot like what people talk about here. They mentioned a <br/>\nbook and I was wondering if he had a book about children (he and his wife <br/>\nfostered approx. 42 children and used those gentle methods with those needy <br/>\nkids), and if so, if anyone had read it, had any opinions on it and/or knew the <br/>\ntitle ?
