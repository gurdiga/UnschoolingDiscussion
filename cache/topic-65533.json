He is doing several things on his own, but we were looking into Rosetta Stone. They are offering it to the school district we are in at quite a reduced rate. I called them and ask if they would offer the same rate for us, homeschoolers, in the same district. He said no, that they can&#39;t. I thought that was too bad and an example of homeschoolers being penalized. I hope I don&#39;t sound like a whiner, but I have to admit I felt put out by it all. Anyway, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283306150,"authorName":"sparrowbird52","from":"&quot;sparrowbird52&quot; &lt;sparrowbird52@...&gt;","profile":"sparrowbird52","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Best Way to Learn Languages","postDate":"1329212295","msgId":65533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpoZGEyNys0OW5uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65534,"prevInTime":65532,"nextInTime":65534,"topicId":65533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello All, My son is 16 and trying to learn Spanish.
