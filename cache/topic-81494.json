We were all taught to write in &quot;italics&quot; (I guess that<br/>\nis the calligraphy designation) in ink, rather than ballpoint or any<br/>\nfelt tip pen, for all of our class work and assignments. After a while<br/>\nwe were given speed tests, and neatness counted - a type of writing<br/>\nseemingly diametrically opposed to writing fast in speed tests that were<br/>\nalso spelling dictation. I recall being middling at it - my writing was<br/>\nnever as beautiful or as fast as many others in the class. However to<br/>\nthis day I am totally mystified as to the purpose of it - other I<br/>\nsuppose than legibility - but then why the fountain pens? I found out<br/>\nlater, when some of my former classmates turned up at my high school,<br/>\nthat in the last term of sixth grade, the entire class was moved on to<br/>\n&quot;Chancellery&quot;, a more curvy and leaning version of the other calligraphy<br/>\n- which seemed to me to be moving backwards if the purpose was<br/>\nlegibility. These classes were experiments in &quot;free&quot; learning<br/>\nsupposedly, but the odd handwriting obsession of the staff was hardly in<br/>\nline with that thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] &quot;Late&quot; readers in public","postDate":"1064599036","msgId":81614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1LjE5N2FmZDZmLjJjYTVkN2ZjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":81549,"nextInTopic":81623,"prevInTime":81613,"nextInTime":81615,"topicId":81494,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/25/03 1:26:40 AM, warblwarbl@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1603904376\">In a message dated 9/25/03 1:26:40 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:warblwarbl@...\">warblwarbl@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So it occurs to me to say _something_ to the rangers in <br/>\ncharge but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea and if it is, I&#39;m not sure what to <br/>\nsay.  <br/>\nAny thoughts appreciated. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a letter to the acting school Holly was going to for a while and said <br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t reading yet, and so please not to put her on the spot in class.

Easy to say &quot;Didn&#39;t you even read what I sent?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I remember there was such a moment.  She got a new teacher who said <br/>\nin front of the others &quot;You have to be able to read to act&quot; or some &quot;have to&quot; <br/>\nstatement.  Holly wasn&#39;t too hurt by it, because she/Holly said as soon as it <br/>\nwas spoken she knew they take really little kids in the classes who totally <br/>\ncan&#39;t read, and being a Shirley Temple fan, she knew Shirley Temple acted before <br/>\nshe could read, so her thought was &quot;wrong.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI called the school and told them to pass Holly&#39;s file to that teacher before <br/>\nthe next class, and next time I was in there she came and apologized to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was ten and was handed a clipboard to fill out the forms for a <br/>\nkarate advancement test, I leaned over to write and the sensei said &quot;He has to do <br/>\nit himself.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;Well he can&#39;t do it himself, I&#39;ll help him.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nHad he said &quot;NO you CAN&#39;T help him&quot; then I would have said &quot;He can&#39;t do it by <br/>\nhimself.  Is he doing his karate okay?  You can help him or I can help him, <br/>\nbut this isnt a writing class, and he&#39;s not writing yet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did that day was just to keep helping, and the next time I came in I <br/>\nbrought a copy of the interview Home Education Magazine published of me, and <br/>\nsaid if he wanted to read that he&#39;d get an idea of my homeschooling philosophy <br/>\nand how we do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just didn&#39;t give him the idea that he could dictate what Kirby had to do <br/>\noutside of karate business.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as it all turns out, Kirby&#39;s one of the favorites at that school and has <br/>\njudged other advancements, with forms, on clipboards, where he has to put his <br/>\ncomments down pretty quickly.
