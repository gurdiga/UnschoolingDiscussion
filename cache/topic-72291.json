She very calmly asked me what that was.   I told her it was a woman that dressed up really pretty and walked up the streets in downtown so people would feel happy and honk there horns at her to say I was doing a good job she was doing.  I think I was 7 and have no memory as to where I came up with this &#39;idea&#39; TV is my guess.  Can you imagine the laugh she probably had?  After she was done being horrified. hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa in Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sort of reminds me of the time in 5th grade when I worked up the nerve <br/>\n  to ask my friend what Olivia Newton-John meant by &quot;Let&#39;s get physical&quot;. <br/>\n  LOL  She laughed at my ignorance, but it turned out that she didn&#39;t <br/>\n  know either.  hee hee<br/>\n<br/>\n  TreeGoddess<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
