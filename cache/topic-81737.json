It wasn&#39;t random, there were only eight--all shown in the book, <br/>\nand if they made good first choices, they could figure out which pattern it <br/>\nwas and fill it all in without &quot;losing,&quot; and that got them into high levels of <br/>\nthe game they couldn&#39;t have found by guessing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nmap reading (from following the maps of the screens, shown fully in the book)<br/>\n<br/>\nalphabetical order (Kirby bought the index to Nintendo Power magazine, with <br/>\nhis own money, before he could read, so I could find articles for him in back <br/>\nissues)<br/>\n<br/>\nliterary notation (I don&#39;t know what else to call this, but in the index, an <br/>\nissue and page number were shown in this format:    22: 17 for issue 22, page <br/>\n17.  Because of that, Shakespeare act/scene/line notation and Biblical John <br/>\n3:16 make simple sense to them, and the idiomatic phrase &quot;he cited me chapter <br/>\nand verse&quot; refers to that notation too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, this might be better accomplished on websites which will have <br/>\nreferences, maps, &quot;walk-throughs&quot; and so forth, but I still recommend game guides <br/>\nfor kids to learn all kinds of things (and get through the games more easily).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":135843572,"authorName":"24hrmom","from":"&quot;24hrmom&quot; &lt;24hrmom@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re.

Watching him play, playing multi-player games with him, and researching game help with him are great ways to spend time together.  And I bet he&#39;d enjoy watching you attempt one of his games on your own with him giving you advice and tips along the way.  You&#39;ll get a first-hand look at what he enjoys about the games and a better appreciation for what he&#39;s learning.  As well as being able to understand what he&#39;s talking about and truly connecting with him when he runs into the room to happily exclaim he just did such-and-such.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;ll love that, and you&#39;ll feel much more a part of the whole video game deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122649447,"authorName":"sonyacurti","from":"&quot;sonyacurti&quot; &lt;jcurtielectric@...&gt;","profile":"sonyacurti","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re.
