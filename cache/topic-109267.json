We&#39;re hoping  this can be a forum for unschoolers to discuss topics related <br/>\nto traveling, cool  sites to visit, finding employment on the road, sharing <br/>\ncool stories and even to  make real life connections. <br/>\nWe would also like to  welcome unschooling families who are not on the road <br/>\nbut would like our  traveling members to stop by for a visit.  A network of <br/>\nlike minded  families and a touch of home mean so much when familiar faces are  <br/>\nscarce. <br/>\nThanks!  I hope this was appropriate to post this here. If not, I apologize <br/>\nin advance.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n~~Vicki~~ Every time I go to the doctors I get a  jacket, a straight one.
