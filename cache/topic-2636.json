It&#39;s the kind of<br/>\nsatellite dish that originally was all there was, until just a few years<br/>\nago.  It moves, to point to whichever satellite you are choosing to watch<br/>\nat the time (there are maybe 20 or so different ones up there).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, the best thing about C-Band is what they call &quot;Wild feeds&quot;-<br/>\nit&#39;s the way companies that sell programming to TV stations *get* the<br/>\nprogramming to the stations.  The stations all have dishes and record<br/>\nprogramming that way- and so can you.  Stuff comes on at very odd times,<br/>\nthough, so you have to try to figure out what is on when.  You can find<br/>\nschedules, but they tend not to be up to date.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most fun wild feeds are not the regular tv shows- it&#39;s the news feeds.<br/>\nDirect news feeds, the stuff that the networks use and stations cut down<br/>\nfor their own nightly news.  You get all of it, and if it&#39;s a big event,<br/>\nyou get nearly 24 hour raw footage coverage, unedited.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also get footage of &quot;off air&quot; stuff, which can be *very* funny.<br/>\nNewspeople swatting bugs while waiting for the broadcast to officially<br/>\nstart, that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get Canadian satellites, and in some parts of the country, you can<br/>\npick up the Mexican satellites, too (but not here).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt costs more to get the system in the first place, but the programming<br/>\ncosts can be much less, and you get more stuff.  The wild feeds are all<br/>\nfree.  &quot;cable&quot; and premium channels still cost, as do networks.  There are<br/>\nsome restrictions on whether you can get the networks, a very odd law, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s an issue with the little digital dishes, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nLinda Wyatt<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hilinda@...\">hilinda@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda\">http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda</a><br/>\nLearning everywhere, all the time.<br/>\nAlgebra before breakfast<br/>\n&quot;A lie, you see, no matter how often or how vociferously repeated, may be<br/>\nmistaken for the truth, but it does not become the truth.&quot; - Adam Crown</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Rhiahl@xxx.xxx","from":"Rhiahl@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"SDDmvlCEaU2WbmzF0ab1AMndFa6lR2Kh0Asa046C7MkqqAf_ehsinn4RHMBc7zhZW75CKTw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV our way","postDate":"936677308","msgId":2673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTIuMjY3My45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2671,"nextInTopic":2741,"prevInTime":2672,"nextInTime":2674,"topicId":2636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/6/99 7:15:21 PM Pacific Daylight Time, vriche@surfsouth.com writes:  If they are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-908952255\">In a message dated 9/6/99 7:15:21 PM Pacific Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vriche@...\">vriche@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Maybe it has improved since you had it, Charlotte? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are still as bad as they were when I had them, they&#39;d be out of <br/>\nbusiness....  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo kidding..<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Rhiahl@xxx.xxx","from":"Rhiahl@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FmZDVkJiORcirVYmUyFtgIKEkrzC7v8jIW2BIo1tG3SyQK4aNnhswY_DP2Jq5h1IWrcLjEw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV our way","postDate":"936677158","msgId":2671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTEuMjY3MS45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2662,"nextInTopic":2673,"prevInTime":2670,"nextInTime":2672,"topicId":2636,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/6/99 6:43:10 PM Pacific Daylight Time, hilinda@lightlink.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-249588804\">In a message dated 9/6/99 6:43:10 PM Pacific Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hilinda@...\">hilinda@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Personally, I recommend a C-Band dish rather than a digital dish.

So when I had the opportunity to<br/>\nget a dish, I jumped at the chance.  There are wonderful educational<br/>\nofferings on some of the channels, but a lot of junk to sift through, also.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how satellite television differs in Canada from here in the<br/>\nStates, but our dish has several different packages at various prices.  I<br/>\nthink the smallest package includes Discovery, Learning Channel and the<br/>\nHistory Channel.  Also Animal Planet, which my youngest adores.  If you get<br/>\nthe network package, it includes public television.  And for my older<br/>\nchildren, the Independent Film Channel has foreign language movies, so they<br/>\ncan listen to French and Spanish.  A caveat, however, many of those movies<br/>\nare NOT suitable for children--we watched a French comedy the other day<br/>\nwhich I thought was hysterically funny, but I sent my youngest out of the<br/>\nroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Campbell & Wyman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brynlee@...\">brynlee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; IS there a dish you can get which allows you to pay for only the channels<br/>\n&gt; you choose??
