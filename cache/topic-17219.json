The men must shave their legs and wear makeup <br/>\ndaily, which they must apply themselves either while driving or while <br/>\nmaking four lunches.  They must attend weekly PTA meetings;<br/>\nclean up after their sick children at 3:00 a.m; make an Indian hut <br/>\nmodel with six toothpicks, a tortilla and one marker; and get a 4 <br/>\nyear old to eat a serving of peas.
