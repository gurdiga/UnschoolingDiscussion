My name is Laura Yolo, my dh John and I<br/>\n  are homeschooling our 9yo ds Noah in central<br/>\n  Washington state. We also have a 16mo ds Aidan at home<br/>\n  during the day. Our older three children are from my<br/>\n  first marriage, they are dd&#39;s Jenny 15 and Ryan 11.5,<br/>\n  who live with us and attend public school because of<br/>\n  our custody agreement. And ds Shaw almost 14, who<br/>\n  lives with my ex-husband in Florida and attends public<br/>\n  school. This has been our first year back to<br/>\n  homeschooling after ds spent 2 very bad years in<br/>\n  public school. <br/>\n<br/>\n  We have been using Sonlight curriculum on and off this<br/>\n  year. It&#39;s a great curriculum, we actually both love<br/>\n  the books, but I don&#39;t really follow their schedule.<br/>\n  The more reading I do about unschooling, the more I<br/>\n  realize how much of this philosophy I agree with. I am<br/>\n  a terrible chicken though and I&#39;m afraid not to buy a<br/>\n  curriculum, even if I don&#39;t use half of it. So I&#39;m<br/>\n  here to learn and ask a bunch of questions so I can<br/>\n  build my confidence and maybe save us $500 worth of<br/>\n  curriculum this year. I look forward to getting to<br/>\n  know everyone:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  =====<br/>\n  Laura, blessed to be the mommy of<br/>\n  Jenny 11/6/85<br/>\n  Shaw 5/22/87<br/>\n  Ryan 7/9/89<br/>\n  Noah 3/9/92<br/>\n  Aidan 1/24/00<br/>\n<br/>\n  __________________________________________________<br/>\n  Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n  Yahoo!
