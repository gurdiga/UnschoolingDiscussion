I am the one that is<br/>\n&quot;reforming&quot; myself and them to unschool. It does seem like cheating, as<br/>\nsomeone mentioned earlier. The old message is &quot;you have to do it because<br/>\neveryone else is&quot; and the old one &quot;would you jump of a cliff if everyone<br/>\nelse was doing it?&quot; that my parents used to tell me.:) No contradiction<br/>\nthere... Yes, I think my 19 year old son needs time to recover from<br/>\npublic school - it seems sometimes it takes people an entire life time.<br/>\nWhat he does best is write - deep, thoughtful, tear producing articles,<br/>\nstories, songs, and so on. He sings beautifully. He has a following and<br/>\ncan&#39;t see that for himself right now. He works in a convenience store<br/>\nthat mostly sells liquor.

I think that is a<br/>\nstrong point. No matter how much I tell him I think he is &quot;perfect&quot; he<br/>\nhas his own stuff to go through like the rest of us. It is hard to let<br/>\ngo. He thinks he has to go and learn something - he already knows so<br/>\nmuch and voids a lot of it out. Programming. Right now I am hearing him<br/>\nsay I shouldn&#39;t homeschool and going ahead and doing it anyway. I think<br/>\nwe will all learn about unschooling little by little. Like everything<br/>\nelse it is a process.
