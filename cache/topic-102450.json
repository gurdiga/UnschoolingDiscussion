They&#39;re both fiddling (hah!) around with jazz, blue  grass, and <br/>\nceltic sounds too. But that&#39;s just where it starts. Brian and  Cameron talk <br/>\nphilosophy a lot. Politics. Religion. They have very different  backgrounds---but <br/>\nat the same time, they have a lot in common.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBrian challenges Cameron a lot and makes him think. Not in a teacherly-way,  <br/>\nbut in a deep-thinking-look-at-all-sides-what-do-you-think kind of way. It&#39;s  <br/>\nbeen so good for Cameron.<br/>\n <br/>\nBrian&#39;s very up-beat, charming, smart----with a killer smile. You can tell  <br/>\nhe loves life and makes the most of each day.

He&#39;ll get to meet a few of her college  friends---hang <br/>\nout and do &quot;college-y&quot; things.<br/>\n <br/>\nI love when he goes away like this: he comes home markedly more aware and  <br/>\nmature and at ease.

I  think maybe just <br/>\nas power play and puff-uppery (puffery? &lt;g&gt;) the guy  started in on Kirby <br/>\nlately saying &quot;You have to go to college.&quot;  And at  first he had Kirby kinda <br/>\nspooked and nervous, but I called  his bluff and  said something like &quot;Tell Glen <br/>\nif he wants to take you down there and get you  signed up to go ahead, but I&#39;d <br/>\nrather wait until YOU want to go instead of going  by age, and Glen has no <br/>\nidea what he&#39;s talking about.&quot;  (Because it made me  grouchy that Glen would <br/>\nintimidate Kirby.)<br/>\n <br/>\nBut lately there was another of those stories.  Glen the boss&#39;s  husband went <br/>\nto Gencon (big gaming convention.  Kirby went too!  Kirby  was there for <br/>\nthree solid days (opted out of day 4 to go to Disneyland with his  siblings and <br/>\ntwo of Pam Sorooshian&#39;s kids).  Kirby never saw Glen  once.  Turns out Glen was <br/>\n(he says) there for a while on Saturday. <br/>\n <br/>\nHmmm....   <br/>\nHad Kirby not been there, I&#39;m sure Glen would be posturing and posing about  <br/>\nwho all he saw and how much he learned.   As it is, though, Kirby  learned <br/>\nseveral new games, picked up some sample stuff and much news, and  so...  one <br/>\nmore thing to run Kirby off about. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nProbably Glen&#39;s trip to California will be a business expense.  That&#39;s  okay. <br/>\n I just wish he would display some appreciation for Kirby.   Other people at <br/>\nwork like Kirby.  (Oh!  another thing to be jealous  about!)<br/>\n <br/>\nSide story, but that&#39;s okay.   Kirby works and hangs around with  some people <br/>\nwho have college degrees, and some who never went, and some who went  for a <br/>\nwhile and might or might not go back.

Is he excited <br/>\nabout  it? <br/>\nNervous? What are his reasons for going?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nPressure from his boss (whom, I suspect, might&#39;ve been subtly trying to get  <br/>\nrid of him &lt;g&gt;), partly.  More than that, friends (some of the girls  in the <br/>\ngroup he went to the Los Alamos prom with) saying &quot;Oh you *have* to come  to <br/>\nstate and hang around with us.&quot;  And another former co-worker, Ryan,  who&#39;s 22 <br/>\nor so and was going to state.  That was another lure.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut last fall Kirby went down there to stay with those girls  (sophomores) <br/>\nfor three days and go to classes with them.  He hung out  with Ryan some and <br/>\nwith the girls some.  He liked the biology class.   Didn&#39;t understand a word in <br/>\nthe chemistry class.  Went with them to their  &#39;office hours&#39; (where they tutor <br/>\nfreshmen who&#39;re having a hard time in math or  science).<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen he got back he just didn&#39;t like them as much anymore. He was  coming to <br/>\nthink they were boring, maybe a little shallow.  He went  with them to their <br/>\nmartial arts class where there were belt tests for younger  kids.  Later he <br/>\ncritiqued the tests, saying he thought they were too  intimidating and not <br/>\nencouraging for young kids, and that where he studies the  tests are done more <br/>\ngently.  The girls didn&#39;t get it.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat was the week Halo II came out.  He told them it was the biggest  event <br/>\nto date in video gaming.  They didn&#39;t get it; thought he was  silly. <br/>\n <br/>\nRyan moved back after this semester and will be entering the air force in  <br/>\nsix months or so.  So the allure of New Mexico State had faded.<br/>\n <br/>\nMeanwhile, though, he had kind of liked the feeling and the feedback he was  <br/>\ngetting when he said he was thinking of going to college.  And we had  talked <br/>\nhim into taking a couple of classes here to see if he even liked it, and  to <br/>\nbe near so Keith and I could help him if he wanted help.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Is he excited about it? <br/>\nNervous? -=-<br/>\n <br/>\nCalm as with all things, it seems.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-And what do you think of college after all these years of unschooling?  -=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen he went to driver&#39;s ed at 16 I felt like it was his first day of  <br/>\nschool.  Now tomorrow feels like his first day of school.  That&#39;s how  I feel about <br/>\nhim going.  The way I feel about it in general is that most  who are there are <br/>\ngoing to shut some adult up, or to get some government benefit  or other, or <br/>\nto continue to qualify for health insurance (which can qualify  under the <br/>\nfirst two reasons too), and that dilutes the quality of the experience  for <br/>\neveryone.  But I think that tradition goes back at least a thousand  years too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nEleventh century dad:  &quot;You need to stop just hanging around, and  start <br/>\ngoing to work with your brother, or go to the Crusades or  something.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nEleventh century 18 year old:  &quot;But Daaa--ad, I really want to go to  the <br/>\nUniversity of Paris with my fri---ends&quot; (meaning I don&#39;t want to go into  <br/>\nbusiness or join the crusades).<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=- What value do you expect/hope it will add to Kirby&#39;s life?-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI expect that he will feel pretty good about himself when he sees that he&#39;s  <br/>\nahead in some ways of people who went to school for all the 12 or 13 years  <br/>\nthey thought they had to go or else the world wouldn&#39;t turn right or they would  <br/>\nbe illiterate criminals.  He probably kind of knows that, but here come  some <br/>\nmeasuring moments.  I don&#39;t expect grades or scores to form  his self esteem <br/>\nor personal image at this point.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope he will meet some people he likes (not that he needs more friends,  <br/>\nbut he might meet some who introduce him to new ideas outside of the gaming and  <br/>\nfantasy field, which isn&#39;t a bad field, and I hope they don&#39;t introduce him <br/>\nto  the drugs and alcohol fields, but if he wanted that he could be doing it  <br/>\nalready).<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope he will discover anthropology. (Totally selfish on that one.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope he will find many clarifying moments, whether about how people are,  <br/>\nhow life is, or the value of his own ideas in the face of prescribed &quot;right  <br/>\nanswers&quot; in writing style or literary commentary or mathematical thought.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll discover some academic field that really intrigues him.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll go into hotel and restaurant management.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll just learn enough to know what formal classroom learning is  like <br/>\nand decide he doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158061474,"authorName":"lindamariesmith2003","from":"&quot;lindamariesmith2003&quot; &lt;daveandlindasmith@...&gt;","profile":"lindamariesmith2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kirby starts classes tomorrow","postDate":"1105300000","msgId":102453,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyczFuMCtzamE4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFhYi4yZjg4MGE4Yi4yZjEyZDFiM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102452,"nextInTopic":102455,"prevInTime":102452,"nextInTime":102454,"topicId":102450,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra Thank you for posting that!

I wasnt sure if they would <br/>\nlet him re-take a test if he scored too low and we&#39;ve never really <br/>\ntalked to an unschooler that made this kind of move.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kirby starts classes tomorrow","postDate":"1105299593","msgId":102451,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyczFhOSs3cWhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFhYi4yZjg4MGE4Yi4yZjEyZDFiM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":102450,"nextInTopic":102452,"prevInTime":102450,"nextInTime":102452,"topicId":102450,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for posting all the boring details.

Gloriously","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-687356737\">Tomorrow, Kirby starts college.  It&#39;s a small start, and it might be a  short <br/>\nstart, or he might go on to get a PhD and teach at some university.   <br/>\nGloriously for us all, I neither know (nor could anyone else who might claim  surety <br/>\nabout their kids&#39; plans) nor care.  Any way it turns out is  fine.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s a community college here called TVI (Technical Vocational  <br/>\nInstitute).  It does lots of certificate programs and associates&#39; degrees  kinds of <br/>\nthings, but has arts and sciences, too, calibrated to transfer to the  University <br/>\nof New Mexico (also in town) and other state schools.<br/>\n <br/>\nKirby will be taking English 101<br/>\nMath 99 (not college credit)<br/>\nand CSE 100 (not for credit, and an interesting thing)<br/>\n <br/>\nSo the English will be writing.  I&#39;ll let you know how that  goes.  He first <br/>\ntested two points too  low on one of the tests.   These details are boring and <br/>\nI promise not to write anything else interesting  below this, so anyone who <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t care can bail now.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs he hadn&#39;t taken a GED and had no high school grades, but is 18, he took  <br/>\nthe Accuplacer tests, which are given in a little computer testing room.   He <br/>\nhad never taken &quot;real&quot; tests like this, nothing but the driver&#39;s ed  tests.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn November 16 he got these scores:<br/>\n77 Reading Comprehension<br/>\n41 Arithmetic <br/>\n86 Sentence skills.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe test-report-generated note says &quot;Your Sentence Skills score is high  <br/>\nenough for English 101 but you also need a Reading score of 80 or completion of  <br/>\nReading 101 or equivalent.  To place into English 101, you need a Reading  <br/>\nscore of 80 or above.  You hve the option of retaking the Reading  test.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI wanted him to be getting college credit in something, so I suggested he  <br/>\nretake it.  He was willing, but in no hurry.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt the time he was wanting to transfer to New Mexico State in Las Cruces  <br/>\n(near El Paso, five hours away), but he has since changed his mind, for which  <br/>\nI&#39;m glad.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn December 13 he took the reading test again, with no preparation other  <br/>\nthan the experience of having taken the test before.  It didn&#39;t have the  same <br/>\nitems so it wasn&#39;t a straight repeat.  He scored 105.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I don&#39;t know what the highest possible scores are on those tests, but  <br/>\nhe&#39;s in English 101, with  never a writing class, having learned what he  knows <br/>\nfrom just reading and goofing, writing to friends on the internet, being  in a <br/>\ntalking, reading family.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf they have to write by hand, he will have a steep learning curve.   If <br/>\neverything is turned in from computer-entry, he should do okay.<br/>\n <br/>\nMath is just some remedial math.  Not their lowest level,  either.<br/>\nThe catalog shows <br/>\nMath 092, Math Anxiety<br/>\nMath 094, Introduction to Calculators<br/>\nMath 096 Special topics in developmental math<br/>\nMath 097 Basic Mathematics<br/>\nMath 099 Basic College Mathematics<br/>\n <br/>\nThen there are three more, 100A, 100B, 100, all algebra, also  <br/>\npre-college-credit level.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo depending how he does in 99, he might be able to test into &quot;real&quot; for  <br/>\ncredit math, 121/algebra, next time if he&#39;s interested. Or he might just go on  <br/>\nto the also-non-credit 100 level stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe third class is called College Success Experience, and is about how to  <br/>\ntake notes and tests, how to study, how to schedule one&#39;s time to do well in  <br/>\nschool.  What I find fascinating is that it&#39;s 45 theory hours and 15 lab  hours.<br/>\n <br/>\nTheory and lab.  Huh.<br/>\nI certainly hope it involves his other two classes and that they haven&#39;t  <br/>\njust made up some 60 hours of make-work, seat-work, busy-work, practice  stuff.  <br/>\nIt gives me the creeps to think about it.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut on the up side, he will be taking this class with others who DID go to  <br/>\nschool and didn&#39;t figure these things out on their own.  So he&#39;ll learn a  lot <br/>\nabout what he knows, and that&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe paid tuition for the English class, but the other two are  <br/>\ngratis/tax-supported.   The books cost $180 for three classes.   Irritating, but so it goes.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAt this point his potential plan is to go to UNM someday and that&#39;s in  town, <br/>\nso fine.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;ll just see how it goes.  I&#39;ll ask him if he wants me to remind him  about <br/>\nhomework or not.  When I was his age I was a full time university  sophomore, <br/>\nliving away from home, my parents had divorced and I lived at school  in the <br/>\ndorm, and visited one or the other parent on weekends in smaller houses I  <br/>\nhadn&#39;t ever lived in.
