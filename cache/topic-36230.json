Any<br/>\nthoughts?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the content so much as the method.  When school is good, it&#39;s about <br/>\nthe real world!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen school is bad, it&#39;s repetitive over and over again (understandably for <br/>\nthe assembly line, but each kid sits through most explanations year after <br/>\nyear).  When school is bad, it involves age-expectations, and labels of <br/>\n&quot;ahead,&quot; &quot;behind&quot; (in fancier terms often, with federal funding involved), <br/>\n&quot;differently abled&quot;....  I could go on, but I&#39;m not going to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother difference between school and unschooling, as to content, is they <br/>\ncalled a small sliver of the world &#39;all,&#39; and we call all of a life&#39;s <br/>\nlearning &#39;some.&quot;  While professionals are afraid unschoolers will fail to <br/>\ncover &quot;all&quot; the material, we KNOW the best of their students 1) learned most <br/>\nof what they know outside of school;<br/>\n2) only were &#39;taught&#39; the small packets of information the texbook publishers <br/>\ndesigned to fit into semesters, units, weeks, lessons;<br/>\n3) will forget most of what they regurgitate on the short-term-memory <br/>\nexercises known as &quot;tests&quot;;<br/>\n4) will consider themselves finished learning at high school graduation,  <br/>\nunless they go to college (in which case see above).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The lego people farmed for weeks (closest thing to a diarama likely to<br/>\nhappen here!).  My son drew pictures of farms (during church, but hey!).<br/>\nBut I never sat him down to do those things, he just did them. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my fondest memories is of putting out a creche scene one Christmas (a <br/>\nChristian home-diarama) of Italian design and manufacture, about 5&quot; high on <br/>\nthe adults, and made of hard plastic, like from the 1950&#39;s or 1960&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw it for what it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby and Marty saw it as what it was from their point of view:  &quot;Jesus <br/>\naction figures&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I came in and there were two Ninja Turtles adoring Jesus, while a <br/>\nking and a shepherd had gone off to help vanquish Splinter and the Foot Clan.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36546,"nextTopicId":36553}}
