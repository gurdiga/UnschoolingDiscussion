I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s a<br/>\ndestructive pattern of thinking because, frankly, it alters the way I look<br/>\nat and interact with my children. Seeing them as hindrances and something I<br/>\nneed an escape from ultimately isn&#39;t good for our relationships. I&#39;ve been a<br/>\nlot happier (and I&#39;m sure they have, too!) since I&#39;ve consciously accepted<br/>\nthat they will be with me almost always and that my goal is to enjoy them<br/>\nand to make life as rich for them as possible. Maybe it&#39;s easier for me<br/>\nbecause I have always enjoyed them tremendously -- with just occasional<br/>\nbouts of frustration -- and they&#39;ve never been to school or preschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house isn&#39;t neat. I don&#39;t cook from scratch all the time -- I often make<br/>\nahead large batches of basic ingredients we all like: rice, meat, potatoes<br/>\n-- and we eat fruit and veggies raw most of the time. I used to do the<br/>\nbuying club and make more whole wheat breads and biscuits and such, but I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen simplifying our diets -- partially because I don&#39;t need that many carbs<br/>\nand the kids don&#39;t miss them. I don&#39;t do a lot of chopping. I do spend a lot<br/>\nof time with my husband, just talking about current events and sports and<br/>\nother things of interest to both of us, and I spend a lot of time talking to<br/>\nand doing things with my kids: library, parks, museums, the skating rink.<br/>\nToday we&#39;re going to a pumpkin patch. I also work a lot on the computer -- I<br/>\nhave deadlines and paying clients and then volunteer work on top of that. My<br/>\ncomputer is right next to the TV in our playroom. I don&#39;t suffer from<br/>\ndepression (I know I&#39;m lucky) -- when I&#39;ve had bouts of the blues it&#39;s<br/>\nfrequently when I have felt trapped, oftentimes because I&#39;ve been sitting<br/>\naround the house, looking inward and looking at my life&#39;s restrictions<br/>\nrather than the possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\nin LA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108788,"nextTopicId":108791}}
