He knew that he wouldn&#39;t get to play with the kids, \n<br>he knew that he would have to sit still all day, and do worksheets BUT he \n<br>still wanted to go. He was just curious. He wanted to find out for himself. \n<br>We took a tour during lunch hour, and he thought it was soooo cool that the \n<br>kids lined up, picked up their own trays, etc. It was all so new to him. He \n<br>also wanted to ride the bus. When kids have never been to school, the whole \n<br>experience can seem very exciting. Fortunately, our homeschooling theater \n<br>group is exciting too.\n<br>Wendy\n<br>n a message dated 2/7/01 3:05:48 PM Central Standard Time, \n<br>Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes:\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\" style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;\">I wonder if your daughter knows that you realy dont get that much \n<br>time to &#39;play&#39; with friends at school, and friends do tend to fall \n<br>out and play with other children more at school than at home.\n<br></blockquote></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"3\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16093,"nextTopicId":16000}}
