I&#39;m Kyle and my wife is Paula.  We have two children, Steven 13<br/>\nand Kayla 9.  We have been homeschooling now for six yrs. or I guess I<br/>\nshould say conducting school at home.  We just started unschooling about<br/>\nthree weeks ago. I have made feeble attempts at it in the past but  have<br/>\nhad a hard time turning over the reigns of control.  Ok, Ok, I&#39;m still<br/>\nstruggling with that one but am learning to trust my children more<br/>\neveryday.  I&#39;ve read all of John Holts books subscribe to GWS and HEM<br/>\nand believe in the homeschooling or natural learning philosophy with al<br/>\nof my being, but believing and doing are to totally different things.<br/>\nSo here we are now trying to put legs to our beliefs.  <br/>\n    Being the primary domestic engineer for the past six years I would<br/>\nlove to here from any other homedads if there are any of you out there. <br/>\nKyle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7605,"nextTopicId":7608}}
