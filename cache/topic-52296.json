HEAR!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Homeopathy has really changed our lives and absolutely enhanced our<br/>\n&gt; quality of life. If I ever go back to school, it would be to become a<br/>\n&gt; certified homeopath.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best,<br/>\n&gt; Liza<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 6:04 PM -0500 12/14/02, Yol, Vishnu & Shanti wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Hi Liza,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;You mean the proving symptoms?

It&#39;s not a big remedy, but one of its main features is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it helps speed up the healing process of broken bones and other<br/>\n&gt; &gt;injuries (periosteum, cartilages, etc.).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Regards,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Yol<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Liza Sabater wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;What&#39;s the proving for Symphytum?

If it&#39;s inflammed and feels<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;bruised, give the arnica (two pellets) every couple hour until it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;feels better. Try to avoid any other painkillers. If if&#39;s too<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;painful, give the arnica more frequently. Then you can give the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;symphytum (two pellets) twice a day for a few days, to speed up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the process of healing.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If you can&#39;t find the symphytum, give her comfrey tea, or email me<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;if you have any questions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
