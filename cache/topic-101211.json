My anxiety level has been building for last couple of weeks.<br/>\nLast night took me over the edge.  I am the music minister at our church and<br/>\nhad choir practice to lead and my husband who is the pastor needed to go<br/>\nvisit someone.  He mentioned that Barbara would hang around and keep an eye<br/>\non the girls for me.  I had a fleeting thought that they really didn&#39;t need<br/>\nanyone (they are 12 &9) but thought what could it hurt.  Well, was I so<br/>\nwrong!  She ended up taking them to her house.  She grilled them on how<br/>\n&quot;moma does school&quot;  Oh, bless there hearts, they tried to tell her about<br/>\nchild led learning and about things they do in a day, but kept saying, &quot;you<br/>\nreally need to ask our mom because she can explain it better.&quot;  My 12 yo<br/>\nsaid the lady gave a look of disapproval and kept grilling.  I was more than<br/>\nirate!  My 12 yo said she got really scared.  I think that&#39;s what added  my<br/>\nanger.  I don&#39;t like my girls feeling scared over situations like that. We<br/>\nhad this long conversation about how they didn&#39;t need to tell others<br/>\nanything except they are allowed to learn about the things that interests<br/>\nthem and to talk with moma.  Gosh I was so taken back that I really don&#39;t<br/>\neven remember my whole conversation with my girls.  Then the panic hit!  I<br/>\ncame home and pulled out the library sheet where they can read so many hours<br/>\nfor an ice cream at Ben and Jerry&#39;s and then the math workbook.  O.K., I<br/>\nknow what you are thinking.....What was she thinking?  I wasn&#39;t! :( I<br/>\nfinally settled down.  But the truth is I don&#39;t feel like I do enough with<br/>\nmy girls.  It is so hard to explain in an e-mail.  Our lives have been so<br/>\ncrazy for the past year.  We have had three moves and new jobs, etc. I feel<br/>\nlike I am still settling.  I read about all the neat things others are doing<br/>\nand think.... I am such a failure.  I keep telling myself we are o.k. and we<br/>\nall just needed time to settle after such a whirlwind in our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me vent.

None of them have ever been in any kind of school. Although I always planned to keep my children out of school, when G was three we thought we&#39;d give nursery school a try, see if he liked it as a fun activity, meet some kids. The first day, I watched as a mom handed over her wailing child to the teacher and ran out, in tears herself. : ( My husband and I stayed with George as he was nowhere near ready for us to leave. When it was time to go outside, we were talking to the teacher about George&#39;s reaction to things that day (he was hating it). She said, &quot;Well, we&#39;ll need to phase you both out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPhase us out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe never went back and that was our last encounter with school. Phase us out???<br/>\n<br/>\nReading posts on this list over the past week or so has been very helpful in firming my resolve about unschooling. I&#39;m prone to thinking those typical thoughts about getting &quot;behind&quot;, feeling defensive to the grandparents, wanting to get out the workbooks, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust last week, I had a hit of anxiety and did get out the workbooks, some asinine thing about matching up letters. G did one line of it, hated it, we had a big power struggle with raised voices and him removing himself into his room. I walked by ten minutes later and he said, &quot;Momma? Want to do some blocks with me and count them? That&#39;s learning too...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOy. Good thing one of us has his act together!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for being out there with your thoughtful words.
