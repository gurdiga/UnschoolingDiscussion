GWS was really a great mag.  It was started by John<br/>\n&gt; Holt.  I miss it so!<br/>\n&gt; I really like the idea of having a database for connecting with others.<br/>\n&gt; Logistically there are a couple of problems.  I don&#39;t have a FAX, and<br/>\nsince<br/>\n&gt; the directory is SO long (17 pages) I can&#39;t afford to run to my local copy<br/>\n&gt; shop and FAX it to you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The other aspect that concerns me is posting all of this information on<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; internet.  Email addresses are one thing, but personal addresses, names of<br/>\n&gt; everyone in the family and DOB&#39;s for the kids seems like something that<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; of these people might not have been volunteering for.  The listings<br/>\ninclude<br/>\n&gt; all of that information.  What is your take on this?  (I think I would not<br/>\n&gt; be comfortable having all of that info posted about myself on the<br/>\ninternet.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It sounds like you are very familiar with how YahooGroups work, with<br/>\n&gt; databases and all of that - so maybe there are security features, etc.,<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; would work.  Let me know what you think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I appreciate your willingness to help unschoolers everywhere and the<br/>\n&gt; generosity of this offer.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; Deborah<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fw: &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; Subscriber List","postDate":"1023897941","msgId":38305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZjUwMWMyMTIyYiQwMTZjZGFjMCQ0NDJiMDM0MEBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":38304,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":38304,"nextInTime":38306,"topicId":38304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I think you would need to get permission from those","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-294530261\">&lt;&lt;Email addresses are one thing, but personal addresses, names of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; everyone in the family and DOB&#39;s for the kids seems like something that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>some<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of these people might not have been volunteering for.
