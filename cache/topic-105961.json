Her web site is down there, if that seems  <br/>\ninteresting to any of you. Pati&#39;s one of my singing partners, and I&#39;ve known her  <br/>\nsince she was a teenager and I wasn&#39;t much older.  She said she was going  to be <br/>\na writer and she is!  But further, she&#39;s become an expert in her  field of <br/>\nhistorical interest, so if you get The History Channel and you&#39;re  interested in <br/>\nthis sort of thing, here&#39;s a little background you can&#39;t get  elsewhere. <br/>\n(Chris is her husband, also in our singing group):<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nChris spotted this listing for Wild West Tech on The History Channel.   Not <br/>\nonly did they actually pay me, it appears they&#39;re finally going to air  the <br/>\nepisode.

But the <br/>\nWest figured into it, too. There were more than  2,000 battles west of the <br/>\nMississippi River--action stretched clear to the  California coast. The <br/>\nrugged, wide-open West presented special challenges  for armies. Soldiers <br/>\nhad to be hearty--able to maneuver themselves and  equipment through ice, <br/>\nsnow, and mountain passes. They often improvised with  whatever they had. <br/>\nShovels and belts proved especially useful. Then there  were the arid <br/>\nplains, which required armies to adapt in different ways. Men  had to cover <br/>\ngreat distances in order to get food, arms, and other supplies.  We&#39;ll take <br/>\na look at the weapons, clothing, transportation, and tools  employed on the <br/>\nCivil War&#39;s Western Front. Host: David Carradine.
