He&#39;s kind, <br/>\ngentle, funny, and pleasant. He&#39;s remarkably in tune with other people, and <br/>\nhas more empathy than I see in most adults (and I work for a church!).   Thus <br/>\nfar, I&#39;m not seeing signs of rebellion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example....the Mall. Julian, being a 13 year old boy, is not real into <br/>\nshopping. However, he knows I do enjoy it sometimes, and don&#39;t really have <br/>\nanyone around most of the time to do it with (who doesn&#39;t hate it). He <br/>\nperiodically suggests we spend an afternoon at the mall together, and is <br/>\nextremely good company on the rare occasion that I take him up on it.  He <br/>\neven hangs out patiently if I&#39;m in a masochistic mood and try on clothes. <br/>\nFurthermore, while at the mall, he often TAKES MY HAND AND HOLDS MY HAND.... <br/>\neven when there are other teenagers around.  (I am told that this is <br/>\nunusual.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, really, I don&#39;t expect that he&#39;ll suddenly turn into a demon. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68312,"nextTopicId":68356}}
