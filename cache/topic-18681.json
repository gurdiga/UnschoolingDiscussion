One of our nearby library&#39;s has a service where they will gather the <br/>\nbooks, etc. for you about anything.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet because I keep <br/>\nforgetting to call them.  I will also show my kids where books about certain <br/>\nsubjects are shelved at the library.

If I know<br/>\n&gt;my kids are interested in something, I get materials I<br/>\n&gt;come across (if they&#39;re affordable or free) and just<br/>\n&gt;leave them lying enticingly around, or just say look<br/>\n&gt;what I got and start working on it myself if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;interested, and they&#39;ll join me. For example, they<br/>\n&gt;were really into King Arthur last year. So I got<br/>\n&gt;everything from  a Monty Python: Quest for the Holy<br/>\n&gt;Grail video to 3-d castle puzzles. We read A<br/>\n&gt;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s court, got<br/>\n&gt;medieval paper dolls, and devoured all the library<br/>\n&gt;books on the topic. If I&#39;d found a King Arthur<br/>\n&gt;wordsearch puzzle, though, they&#39;d never have done it,<br/>\n&gt;because they hate wordsearch puzzles. Sometimes things<br/>\n&gt;flop. Right now, we&#39;re into Colonial times, and they<br/>\n&gt;thought they hated those Dear America books (fictional<br/>\n&gt;but historically accurate journals of kids from<br/>\n&gt;different eras) but I found a great colonial one, so I<br/>\n&gt;just started reading it aloud to them one night, and<br/>\n&gt;they love it. If I&#39;d just left that book on the table,<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;d have ignored it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I guess it&#39;s a matter of not only knowing what<br/>\n&gt;topics they like, but also what ways they like to<br/>\n&gt;explore those topics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My own kids seem to have designed their own thematic<br/>\n&gt;mud this week. :) Seriously! Building mud castles and<br/>\n&gt;moats, digging up worms, compost, gardening.<br/>\n&gt;Everything is mud lately. If someone asked them what<br/>\n&gt;they were learning, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d say they<br/>\n&gt;were studying mud. Well, it *is* April!<br/>\n&gt;Juli<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;=====<br/>\n&gt;How is it that little children are so intelligent and men so stupid?

If I know<br/>\nmy kids are interested in something, I get materials I<br/>\ncome across (if they&#39;re affordable or free) and just<br/>\nleave them lying enticingly around, or just say look<br/>\nwhat I got and start working on it myself if I&#39;m<br/>\ninterested, and they&#39;ll join me. For example, they<br/>\nwere really into King Arthur last year. So I got<br/>\neverything from  a Monty Python: Quest for the Holy<br/>\nGrail video to 3-d castle puzzles. We read A<br/>\nConnecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s court, got<br/>\nmedieval paper dolls, and devoured all the library<br/>\nbooks on the topic. If I&#39;d found a King Arthur<br/>\nwordsearch puzzle, though, they&#39;d never have done it,<br/>\nbecause they hate wordsearch puzzles. Sometimes things<br/>\nflop. Right now, we&#39;re into Colonial times, and they<br/>\nthought they hated those Dear America books (fictional<br/>\nbut historically accurate journals of kids from<br/>\ndifferent eras) but I found a great colonial one, so I<br/>\njust started reading it aloud to them one night, and<br/>\nthey love it. If I&#39;d just left that book on the table,<br/>\nthey&#39;d have ignored it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess it&#39;s a matter of not only knowing what<br/>\ntopics they like, but also what ways they like to<br/>\nexplore those topics. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own kids seem to have designed their own thematic<br/>\nmud this week. :) Seriously! Building mud castles and<br/>\nmoats, digging up worms, compost, gardening.<br/>\nEverything is mud lately. If someone asked them what<br/>\nthey were learning, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d say they<br/>\nwere studying mud. Well, it *is* April! <br/>\nJuli<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nHow is it that little children are so intelligent and men so stupid?
