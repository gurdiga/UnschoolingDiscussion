There is a huge <br/>\nJewish population here, and the women I know have been Rabbi&#39;s for a pretty <br/>\nlong time. . . I am thinking about 20 or 30 years. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess where I come from on Dr. Laura is that she has some good points on <br/>\ncertain things and some things I strongly agree with and somethings I <br/>\nstrongly disagree with. She is extremely homophobic which I find so unusual <br/>\nbecause I know quite a few Jewish people who are the most accepting of all <br/>\nreligions I have found. So, in my own personal life there are people that I <br/>\nstrongly disagree with on some issues. I try to not condemn the person and <br/>\nsee the good they have to offer to me. I am sure I have traits that others <br/>\nfind horrible and I would hope they would not judge me on that one thing or <br/>\nwhatever things they disagree with me on. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always find for myself when a person brings out a very stong reaction in <br/>\nme, then it is time for me to look within because there is something there to <br/>\nteach me. . . something about myself that I am resisting or disliking or some <br/>\nother issue. It never fails for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nliving in abundance<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no victims in this world. . . only opportunities<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31044,"nextTopicId":31046}}
