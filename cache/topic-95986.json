You may step back and view the entire world-not just your <br/>\nhome, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a <br/>\nlaboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, animals, <br/>\nhistory, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a book), music, <br/>\nart , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, and ideas <br/>\nwithout end. Although collections of these treasures have been located in museums <br/>\nfor your convenience, they are to be found everywhere else, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice <br/>\nwhen your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make mistakes, <br/>\nand to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children to <br/>\nexperience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them something to <br/>\ndo. <br/>\n<br/>\nHenceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything <br/>\nyou start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be discontinued as soon as <br/>\nsomething more interesting comes along (or for any other reason) without <br/>\npenalty, and picked up again at any time in the future (or never). <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>\nfeel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>\nharm. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to <br/>\nthink theirs. <br/>\nEach person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>\nprivileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>\ncreating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to obtain <br/>\napproval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do <br/>\nare exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother homeschooling site posted it years ago, with one little tweak in the <br/>\ntext:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Although collections of these treasures have been located in libraries and <br/>\nmuseums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere else, too.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey added &quot;libraries.&quot;<br/>\nI think that largely defeats the purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real question is about this paragraph, in the one I pass out at <br/>\nconferences and have on my own website:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>\nfeel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>\nharm. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it was first written, I had help from other online unschoolers to polish <br/>\nit up for what I thought was a single day&#39;s use at a conference in New <br/>\nMexico.  It has survived many, many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question of unschooling is rarely, these days &quot;Is it okay to take them <br/>\nout of school?&quot;  That&#39;s what the phrase about protecting them from harm was <br/>\nabout, and reclaiming control.  It was about not thinking schools could dictate a <br/>\nfamily&#39;s schedule, or force a child away from parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are more often former other-kinds-of-homeschoolers these days,  I <br/>\nthink, than fresh-from-school families.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem cited by the reader was that some parents will interpret &quot; take <br/>\nwhat steps you feel necessary to protect your children&quot; as encouragement to <br/>\ncontrol their lives, to forbid television.
