There was a plain old book called &quot;Adult Children of Alcoholics.&quot;  But I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>bet<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; now there are websites.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Al-Anon  concept of &quot;detachment&quot; helped me more than anything, and<br/>\n&gt; discussions of that can be found on websits about al-anon and also<br/>\n&gt; co-dependency.   It&#39;s the idea of separating your life from other people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; lives--not in a mean way, but in a way that makes it clearer for you that<br/>\n&gt; their problems are really not your problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At first it seems to mean you would no longer care about the person, but<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s not the idea.  It has come to mean that pretty much for me in my<br/>\n&gt; relationship with my younger half-brother (29).  I don&#39;t want him in my<br/>\n </span></blockquote>life<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I don&#39;t yell about it.  I just tell him quietly and clearly every few<br/>\n&gt; years that I want my kids to grow up without being woken up by drunks, and<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;m sorry for his sad upbringing, but I don&#39;t trust him not to steal<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stuff and there are a lot of other people in the world he can deal with,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he needs to go take care of my mom if he wants some contact with his<br/>\n&gt; relatives.  (Never all that at once, but that&#39;s what he hears from me if<br/>\n </span></blockquote>he<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; collects the whole set.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another concept which changed me was &quot;reparenting.&quot;  Some of the people at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; meeting carried teddy bears around with them to and at meetings.  They<br/>\n </span></blockquote>were<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in therapy groups (mid-80&#39;s, when it was) which recommended they have a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;child&quot; with them and treat that surrogate baby as they would wish to have<br/>\n&gt; been treated.  So their &quot;inner child&quot; was represented by this stuffed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>animal,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and they put their compassion toward making something (anything else;<br/>\n&gt; themselves as children) comfortable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got pregnant within a few months of starting those meetings, so Kirby<br/>\n&gt; became my reparenting object.  I tried to do for/to him what my parents<br/>\n </span></blockquote>could<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have done for/to me if they had had a few more resources and more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>awareness.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My dad worked lots, and happily.  He was very physical and kind and out of<br/>\n&gt; the house a lot, and tired when he was home.  My mom was not good at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>thinking<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; three or four moves out in advance.  She did what seemed best of a very<br/>\n&gt; limited set of choices, and justified in her head that it was good and<br/>\n&gt; sufficient.  I tried consciously to increase my range of choices and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>options<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;

slept with me?  WHAT IF I let them play as long as they wanted at the park<br/>\n&gt; instead of setting a limit in advance?  WHAT IF kids stay up late?  (I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>tried<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all that; the world didn&#39;t end, they didn&#39;t get sick, social services<br/>\n </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; take them away.  So I experimented with other stuff. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; People used to ask us &quot;What time do your kids go to bed?&quot; and we&#39;d say<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Half<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; an hour or so after they go to sleep.&quot;  They would sleep when they were<br/>\n&gt; tired, wherever they were, and would go to sleep near us, usually--in our<br/>\n&gt; laps, on the couch, on the floor, on a nearby chair.  And we&#39;d carry them<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; put them in bed.  Meanwhile our other friends had to plan their lives<br/>\n </span></blockquote>around<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; their children&#39;s bedtimes because the kids were &quot;trained&quot; by the clock and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;routines.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Professionals in those days were always saying &quot;Kids need routine.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I disagree hugely.  Kids need love and confidence.  They need things that<br/>\n&gt;

meetings with childcare, or maybe you could find an internet support<br/>\n </span></blockquote>group.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I bet there is a website kinda like unschooling.com!  I&#39;ve never looked,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;
