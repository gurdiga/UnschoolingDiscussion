You still have the notion that book learning is a great thing and it would be wonderful to teach your child that way. Unschooling is seeing learning in everything. You being able to do that would help your child see it. <br/>\nMeet people that are successful and did not pursue traditional schooling, do things you both love (what are YOUR passions/interests?), treat him as though he were worthy and intelligent and not in need of &quot;filling up&quot; with information.<br/>\nIt sounds like you both need to de-school BIG time if you both think school -like learning is still necessary. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think he needs traditional school at all, I think you&#39;re pouring your own fears into your child and not seeing what he&#39;s learning without school!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple of websites I think you should visit:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dreamsbbs.com/nikleba/unschool.html\">http://www.dreamsbbs.com/nikleba/unschool.html</a><br/>\nLaurie was raised in the unschooling style from birth, read about her successes and pursuits.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.peterkowalke.com/\">http://www.peterkowalke.com/</a><br/>\nPeter is also a raised unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is a journey, each bit of information we get, each new experience helps us build mental models of the world. As your son connects new pieces of information he is interested in, it will stick. Because it is TRUE learning. Memorizing bits and pieces to jump through some stupid hoop (ie:test, homework) is not real learning and doesn&#39;t have any meaning for the person having it foisted upon them.<br/>\nYour ds doesn&#39;t want school...what a smart guy.<br/>\nListen to him, find the things he loves doing and do them! Do the things YOU love to do, show him what a life long learner looks like (wow, was that a lot of &quot;L&#39;s&quot; or WHAT!!!).<br/>\n:)<br/>\nAnyway, I think he needs to follow his heart and you need to listen better...that&#39;s my opinion.

I have been homeschooling my son for two <br/>\nyears with no curriculum to speak of.

He stopped public school after 6th grade, was <br/>\nhomeschooled for 2 years (for 7th and 8th), and now we want <br/>\nhim to restart public school in grade 8 where he will be with kids <br/>\nhis own age rather than with kids a year older than him (he is <br/>\nfine with this).
