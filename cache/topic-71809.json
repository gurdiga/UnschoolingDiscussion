I&#39;m not worried about Tara. I&#39;m not concerned about the playing house thing. Well not sure if that&#39;s the right word. It is bothering me some. I think it&#39;s just the fact that this is another stage in her growing up, or maybe growing out? Tara knows I&#39;m a little apprehensive about it. She said she would stay home if I didn&#39;t want her to go. I&#39;m not going to do that. I kind of feel bad about talking to her because she knows how I feel now. So as much as she wants to go, she also wants to stay but I think only because she thinks I want her to. Is all this making sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want some reassuring words that I will get through this. I guess I just wasn&#39;t ready for the steady house play so soon. At least I think that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71854,"nextTopicId":71882}}
