Some of my best friends live in <br/>\nearthships.  The original community is in the Taos, NM, area, hardly <br/>\noff the grid.  But earthships have now landed in communities all over <br/>\nthe globe.  These are blissfully quiet, delectably comfortable living <br/>\nspaces.  And you can even rent one in the Taos area to stay in for a <br/>\nfew nights to see if earthship living is really for you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of good innovation still going on in New Mexico regarding <br/>\nvariations like straw bale homes, rammed earth homes, and of course, <br/>\nthe traditional labor intensive southwestern mainstay, the adobe <br/>\nhome.  Many live with photovoltaic electricity, composting toilets, <br/>\ngravity fed water systems, Servel refrigerators, passive and active <br/>\nsolar heating, Paloma water heaters (heat as you use), solar water <br/>\nheating, and other alternatives. Some counties even allow grey water <br/>\nsystems!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting place that challenges one to rethink the concept <br/>\nof shelter is The Shelter Institute in Woolwich, Maine.  They teach <br/>\npeople how to design and build their own &quot;shelter,&quot; nudge students to <br/>\nreconsider every aspect of the shelter concept.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88865972,"authorName":"Christine Kuglen","from":"&quot;Christine Kuglen&quot; &lt;wanderfree@...&gt;","profile":"formeandmine","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"alternative energy","postDate":"1046151093","msgId":59640,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE9FMTlpVzJXMVZrTUw0YmFIUGEwMDAwNmJhZEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59645,"prevInTime":59639,"nextInTime":59641,"topicId":59640,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you looked at the website  www.earthship.org?
