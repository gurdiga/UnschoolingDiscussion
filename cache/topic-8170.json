I have a <br/>\n9 1/2yr. old son and a 7yr. old son. My 9 yr old will ask me every question <br/>\nunder the sun about everything in life. Together we find and search out the <br/>\nanswers to all his questions (and sometimes he reads and searches for answers <br/>\nby himself). But, my 7 yr. old never asks us any questions about anything. He <br/>\nloves dinosaurs and big trucks. He does a lot of dinosaur digging in the back <br/>\nyard and he plays with his trucks most of the day. He looks at picture books <br/>\nbut doesn&#39;t yet read. I haven&#39;t pushed him in anyway to learn anything. But, <br/>\nyet he asks us no questions about anything. Is this strange or normal or <br/>\nwhat? Is it because he learns in a different way? Should I be concerned or <br/>\njust let things be? Any suggestions? I would appreciate some advice about <br/>\nthis.<br/>\nLisa H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8165,"nextTopicId":8175}}
