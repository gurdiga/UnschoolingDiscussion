Make sure to have a tissue handy.<br/>\nBlessings-<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The Missing Jesus<br/>\n author unknown<br/>\n <br/>\n      About a week before Christmas the family bought a new nativity scene.<br/>\n When they unpacked it they found 2 figures of the Baby Jesus. &quot;Someone must<br/>\n have packed this wrong,&quot; the mother said, counting out the figures.  &quot;We<br/>\n have one Joseph, one Mary, three wise men, three shepherds, two lambs, a<br/>\n donkey, a cow, an angel and two babies. Oh, dear!  I suppose some set down<br/>\n at the store<br/>\n is missing a Baby Jesus because we have 2.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;You two run back down to the store and tell the manager that we have<br/>\n an extra Jesus.  Tell him to put a sign on the remaining boxes saying that<br/>\n if a set is missing a Baby Jesus, call 7126.  &quot;Put on your warm coats, it&#39;s<br/>\n freezing cold out there.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      The manager of the store copied down mother&#39;s message and the next time<br/>\n they were in the store they saw the cardboard sign that read, &quot;If you&#39;re<br/>\n missing Baby Jesus, call 7126.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      All week long they waited for someone to call.  Surely, they thought,<br/>\n someone was missing that important figurine.  Each time the phone rang<br/>\n mother would say, &quot;I&#39;ll bet that&#39;s about Jesus,  &quot;but it never was.  Father<br/>\n tried to explain there are thousands of these scattered over the country and<br/>\n the figurine could be missing from a set in Florida or Texas or California.<br/>\n Those packing mistakes happen all the time.  He suggested just put the extra<br/>\n Jesus back in the box and forget about it. &quot;Put Baby Jesus back in the box!<br/>\n What a terrible thing to do said the children.&quot;  &quot;Surely someone will call,&quot;<br/>\n mother<br/>\n said.  &quot;We&#39;ll just keep the two of them together in the manger until someone<br/>\n calls.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      When no call had come by 5:00 on Christmas Eve, mother insisted that<br/>\n father &quot;just run down to the store&quot; to see if there were any sets left. &quot;You<br/>\n can see them right through the window, over on the counter,&quot; she said. &quot;If<br/>\n are all gone, I&#39;ll know someone is bound to call tonight.&quot; &quot;Run down to the<br/>\n store?&quot; father thundered.  &quot;It&#39;s 15 below zero out there!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;Oh, Daddy, we&#39;ll go with you,&quot; Tommy and Mary began to put on their<br/>\n coats.  Father gave a long sigh and headed for the front closet.  &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>\n believe I&#39;m doing this,&quot; he muttered.<br/>\n <br/>\n      Tommy and Mary ran ahead as father reluctantly walked out in the cold.<br/>\n Mary got to the store first and pressed her nose up to the store window.<br/>\n &quot;They&#39;re all gone, Daddy,&quot; she shouted.  &quot;Every set must be sold.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;Hooray, Tommy said &quot;The mystery will now be solved tonight!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n       Father heard the news still a half block away and immediately turned<br/>\n on his heel and headed back home. When they got back into the house they<br/>\n noticed that mother was gone and so was the extra Baby Jesus figurine.<br/>\n &quot;Someone must have called and she went out to deliver the figurine,&quot; my<br/>\n father reasoned, pulling off his boots.  &quot;You kids get ready for bed while I<br/>\n wrap mother&#39;s present.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      Then the phone rang.  Father yelled &quot;answer the phone and tell&#39;em we<br/>\n found a home for Jesus.&quot;  But it was mother calling with instructions for us<br/>\n to come to 205 Chestnut Street immediately, and bring three blankets, a box<br/>\n of cookies and some milk.<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;Now what has she gotten us into?&quot; my father groaned as we bundled up<br/>\n again.  &quot;205 Chestnut.  Why that&#39;s across town. Wrap that milk up good in<br/>\n the blankets or it will turn to ice before we get there.  Why can&#39;t we all<br/>\n just get on with Christmas?  It&#39;s probably 20 below out there now.  And the<br/>\n wind is picking up.  Of all the crazy things to do on a night like this.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      When they got to the house at 205 Chestnut Street it was the darkest<br/>\n one on the block.  Only one tiny light burned in the living room and, the<br/>\n moment we set foot on the porch steps, my mother opened the door and<br/>\n shouted, &quot;They&#39;re here, Oh thank God you got here, Ray! You kids take those<br/>\n blankets into the living room and wrap up the little ones on the couch.<br/>\n I&#39;ll take the milk and cookies.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;Would you mind telling me what is going on, Ethel?&quot; my father asked.<br/>\n &quot;We have just walked through below zero weather with the wind in our faces<br/>\n all the way.&quot;  &quot;Never mind all that now,&quot; my mother interrupted.  &quot;There is<br/>\n no heat in this house and this young mother is so upset she doesn&#39;t know<br/>\n what to do.  Her husband walked out on her and those poor little children<br/>\n will have a very bleak Christmas, so don&#39;t you complain.  I told her you<br/>\n could fix that oil furnace in a jiffy.<br/>\n <br/>\n      My mother strode off to the kitchen to warm the milk while my brother<br/>\n and I wrapped up the five little children who were huddled together on the<br/>\n couch.  The children&#39;s mother explained to my father that her husband had<br/>\n run off, taking bedding, clothing, and almost every piece of furniture, but<br/>\n she had been doing all right until the furnace broke down.<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;I been doin&#39; washin&#39; and ironin&#39; for people and cleanin&#39; the five and<br/>\n dime,&quot; she said. &quot;I saw your number every day there, on those boxes on the<br/>\n counter.  When the furnace went out, that number kept going&#39; through my<br/>\n mind. 7162  7162.  &quot;Said on the box that if a person was missin&#39; Jesus, they<br/>\n should call you.  That&#39;s how I knew you were good Christian people, willin&#39;<br/>\n to<br/>\n help folks.  I figured that maybe you would help me, too.  So stopped at the<br/>\n grocery store tonight and I called your missus.  I&#39;m not missin&#39; Jesus,<br/>\n mister, because I sure love the Lord.  But I am missin&#39; heat.  I have no<br/>\n money to fix that furnace.<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;Okay, Okay&quot; said father.  &quot;You&#39;ve come to the right place.  Now lets<br/>\n see. You&#39;ve got a little oil burner over there in the dining room. Shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n be too hard to fix. Probably just a clogged flue. I&#39;ll look it over, see<br/>\n what it needs.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      Mother came into the living room carrying a plate of cookies and warm<br/>\n milk.  As she set the cups down on the coffee table, I noticed the figure of<br/>\n Baby Jesus lying in the center of the table.  It was the only sign of<br/>\n Christmas in the house. The children stared wide-eyed with wonder at the<br/>\n plate of cookies my mother set before them.<br/>\n <br/>\n      Father finally got the oil burner working but said &quot;You need more oil.<br/>\n I&#39;ll make a few calls tonight and get some oil. Yes, sir, you came to the<br/>\n right place,&quot; father grinned.<br/>\n <br/>\n      On the way home father did not complain about the cold weather and had<br/>\n barely set foot inside the door when he was on the phone.<br/>\n <br/>\n      &quot;Ed, hey, how are ya, Ed?&quot;  &quot;Yes, Merry Christmas to you, too. Say Ed,<br/>\n we have kind of an unusual situation here I know you&#39;ve got that pickup<br/>\n truck. Do you still have some oil in that barrel on your truck?  You do?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n      By this time the rest of the family were pulling clothes out of their<br/>\n closets and toys off of their shelves.  It was long after their bedtime when<br/>\n they were wrapping gifts.  The pickup came. On it were chairs, three lamps,<br/>\n blankets and gifts. Even though it was 30 below, father let them ride along<br/>\n in the back of the truck.<br/>\n <br/>\n      No one ever did call about the missing figure in the nativity set, but<br/>\n as I grow older I realize that it wasn&#39;t a packing mistake at all.
