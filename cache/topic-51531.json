One of the more interesting courses was the Philosophy of <br/>\nPhysical Education. You may laugh, but it was fascinating. We also <br/>\nlearned a lot about different philosophies of educating children, and <br/>\nthe professor was very open minded. We had to keep a journal, which I <br/>\nstill have. Here&#39;s two quotes from that class:<br/>\n<br/>\n* &quot;Entertain them hugely while educating them gently.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n* &quot; A true leader becomes progressively unnecessary.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should send Dr. Kelly a thank-you. She was one of those rare <br/>\nteachers who want you to think, think for yourself, and expand how you <br/>\nthink. Just think - I learned a lot of about unschooling while in a <br/>\nteacher education program (but then, that was the seventies.. perhaps <br/>\ntimes have changed. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Saturday, December 14, 2002, at 02:20  AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Petra1128b@...\">Petra1128b@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/13/2002 10:13:53 PM Pacific Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi Susan.  I took my first education foundations class two years ago<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and we discussed John Holt and unschooling for about 5 minutes.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; instructor dismissed the whole philosophy saying that &quot;child-led<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education doesn&#39;t work.&quot;  I&#39;ve only a semester remaining before I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; earn my ele. ed. degree, but in my heart know I can&#39;t go on.  I hate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every single minute of it.  I just want to be at home with my own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kids.  Next semester I am scheduled to be in a classroom in a public<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school &quot;educating&quot; children.  Donna.   <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got my teaching credential years ago - I don&#39;t remember having any <br/>\n&gt; John<br/>\n&gt; Holt.
