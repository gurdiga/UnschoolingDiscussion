I rented<br/>\nthis because my 7yod loves to play baseball and I thought she&#39;d enjoy this<br/>\nmovie about women&#39;s baseball in the 40&#39;s.  She did.  We also watched The<br/>\nRookie, starring the man who was the dad in the latest version of the Parent<br/>\nTrap, so he was familiar to the girls, and I think that helped them enjoy<br/>\nthe movie more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw Catch Me if You Can with my mom, and am planning to rent it soon for<br/>\nfamily viewing, but want to get it when I know dh will have time to watch it<br/>\nwith us.

Ahh, unschooling!  I&#39;d like to thank, again, all<br/>\nthe people who spoke in favor of tv/movies and all the ways that we can<br/>\nlearn from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are enjoying seeing actors/resses in various movies, comparing their<br/>\nacting, etc.  Looking for familiar landmarks in movies that are filmed in<br/>\nplaces we&#39;ve been.  Compare/contrast movies with the books, when we&#39;ve<br/>\nexperinced both.  Finding connections in movies to other things we&#39;ve<br/>\nexperienced.  Looking for mistakes.  Lisa noticed that &quot;Annie&quot; turned off<br/>\nthe light to go to sleep with a glass of wine sitting at the bottom of the<br/>\nbed.  Maybe this was intentional, but I&#39;m guessing someone forgot to have<br/>\nher put it on the nightstand first, or they edited out that part.  Did you<br/>\nknow that it is someone&#39;s job to watch for stuff like this and make sure<br/>\nthat it doesn&#39;t get into the final movie?
