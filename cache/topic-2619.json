But I don&#39;t understand it.  The bones of it.  Do you just get up in <br/>\n the morning and say, &quot;what do you want to do today?&quot; Or do you just get up <br/>\nin <br/>\n the morning?   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa;<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t the original  poster here, but I want to respond.  First of all, I <br/>\ntruly  understand your frustration because I&#39;ve been in a similar spot...and <br/>\nnot that long ago.  I just couldn&#39;t figure out &quot;how to make it work.&quot;  It all <br/>\nsounded so good, and theoretically I believed unschooling could work...but <br/>\nhow to implement it with my own kids stymied me.  <br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve  had many days where I just let them play Legos or whatever and they <br/>\nwould end up fighting a lot and being bored, and I would think...how in <br/>\ntarnation can this possibly work?<br/>\nHere are some things that are helping me at this point in the process.  I <br/>\nfinally came to the realization that I  always felt like we had to be &quot;doing <br/>\nsomething.&quot;  Like I had to define every activity as being worthwhile or not.  <br/>\nAnd I realized that because of this thinking, I was actually blocking some of <br/>\nthe natural learning that might have come out of these activities from <br/>\nhappening.<br/>\nBut, I felt I needed something concrete...something tangible.<br/>\nSo, this is what I&#39;m doing...<br/>\nWhen I was in college, I dated a musician and one of the things that he <br/>\nalways did was to carry a small notebook in his pocket, so that whenever he <br/>\nwould think of something, or read a neat quote or hear something he didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to forget, or just be inspired by nature, he would immediately jot it <br/>\ndown.  This really helped him write lyrics later on.<br/>\nI went on to become a journalist and I copied this technique.<br/>\nWell, it struck me one day that this would really help us with our <br/>\nunschooling.  Because so much of the time my kids would say something during <br/>\nlunch or Lego play or they&#39;d ask a question and we would just forget it or <br/>\nnot get around to it.<br/>\nSo, now, I carry my little pocket notebook around and write these things down <br/>\nand then when we get to a lull, I will pull out this notebook and we&#39;ll start <br/>\ntalking about whatever it was that we wrote down.  If the kids are <br/>\nenthusiastic about it, we pursue it, but if they aren&#39;t we pretty much just <br/>\ndrop it.  <br/>\nThis might sound simplistic, but it has really helped me, because I felt like <br/>\nmy kids were really struggling with &quot;what to do&quot; as much as I was.  I <br/>\nconsider this a tool of &quot;deschooling,&quot; and hope that eventually,  these <br/>\nactivities will just naturally flow.  But, for now, this has really helped us.<br/>\nI&#39;ll give you a for example situation, in case this isn&#39;t concrete enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 10 yo son came home from his friend&#39;s house last weekend and they had put <br/>\ntogether and launched a model rocket.  My son wanted to do that, too.  So, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have time right then, but I wrote it in the book.  Later on that week, <br/>\nwhen they were struggling looking for something to do, I brought up the <br/>\nrocket and he was immediately excited.  He took his lawn mowing money and <br/>\nwent to the store and bought a kit with his Dad and put it together that <br/>\nnight.  The next a.m., he went onto the NASA site on the computer and went to <br/>\nthe library and read and checked out a ton of books about rocketry.  We <br/>\npulled out my older daughter&#39;s old physical science book and talked about <br/>\nacceleration/distance formulas and figured some of them out.  This didn&#39;t <br/>\nturn him off at all.  He even struggled to do some of the Math himself.  That <br/>\nnight, the kids wanted to watch Apollo 13 on video that they got at the <br/>\nlibrary, so my dh and I watched with them.  Yesterday, my brother came over <br/>\nand talked about how he built rockets as a kid and used a car battery to <br/>\nlaunch them. So now Michael wants to try using different power sources to <br/>\nlaunch his rocket.  I wrote that down in the notebook and we&#39;ll get to it the <br/>\nnext time we have a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the notebook entries are duds.  I bring up the subject and the kids <br/>\njust drop it.  But a lot of times, they seem like just the starter the kids <br/>\nand I both need.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps some.   I didn&#39;t share this so you would necessarily feel <br/>\nlike you had to do it yourselves, but just to show you that there are many <br/>\nways to help ourselves get through the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of all, be patient with yourself.  It doesn&#39;t take shape overnight!  <br/>\nAfter all, most of us were raised with the school mentality ourselves.  And <br/>\nall of us are learning as we go and doing, as David said, whatever works that <br/>\nday!<br/>\nTake care...glad you&#39;re asking questions!<br/>\nCarol from WI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2541,"nextTopicId":2675}}
