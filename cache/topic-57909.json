I have just purchased the 2003 edition and it&#39;s another favorite of his.  He also likes joke books, _Outdoor Life_ magazine, and a  few comic books.  We have tried to suggest books to him but he has no interest in them.  At all.  He does love to cook so he reads recipes and directions frequently.   I just try to notice all of the things he reads thoughout the day and not worry about it.  (This is the kid who learned to read by looking at the TV Guide channel to see when his favorite shows were coming on!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust some more thoughts......<br/>\n<br/>\nKimber<br/>\nMomma to ds9 and dd7<br/>\n<br/>\nps..Hey it snowed in Arkansas today!  Not enough to let schools out but there is 2-3 inches on the ground that my kids are thoroughly enjoying!  We haven&#39;t had any accumulation here for the past 2 or 3 years so the kids are just ecstatic.  Something I was thinking about......I remember when I was in school, the thrill of the possiblity of snow which also meant the possiblity of school being cancelled.  Then the disappointment when we had to go to school anyway.  What good was the snow if we couldn&#39;t miss school???  My kids are so happy just BECAUSE of the snow.  They are enjoying the peacefullness and the beauty without even a thought about whether they will get to miss school or not.  It&#39;s a little sad watching the snow falling and knowing the other kids in town are watching it through the windows...........<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] TV, was Re: Is Unschooling ATransformation?","postDate":"1044549171","msgId":58061,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNDI4RTMzLkM0NjI4NkFDQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGFlLjM4MTM4MGEzLjJiNzNkODJhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58055,"nextInTopic":58071,"prevInTime":58060,"nextInTime":58062,"topicId":57909,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**My son loves those gaming books, computer, PS2 and the table top gaming books.

I used to do alot of restricting and have now stopped,  my kids are just fine,  no sitting in front of the TV for hours or anything.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I think what really got the idea through to me was that we don&#39;t know what will be the route of learning for our children,  or how exactly they will learn.  <br/>\n <br/>\n     I was never ever going to own a video system.  I also hate violence.     I used to equate the two.    But what about my son who loves video games and computers,   he&#39;s  very mechanical and his mind works in strategic ways,   so he loves games and he loves action movies.  I don&#39;t really enjoy them, but does that mean he shouldn&#39;t be able to watch them?  Yes there might be some violence in them, but that doesn&#39;t make him violent.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe&#39;ll probably end up working with computers or engineering or building things or what ever; who knows what it can lead to.    But if he didn&#39;t have those mediums to learn he would really be limited,   he would possibly find something to do or maybe kind-of enjoy.  Who knows how long he would enjoy it.   But most likely it would be something that I would have felt he should be doing.  Not what he wanted to be doing.       There is where lies the difference.   <br/>\n <br/>\nHe would have been limited to my likes and he may have ended up in a hazey type of existence.   Asking himself--what do I really like? <br/>\n <br/>\nIt takes alot of open minded considering,  whether we want our kids to grow up how we want them to be or how they want themselves to be.        I vote with them becoming who they want to be!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:on 2/5/03 10:20 AM, Liz Pomeroy at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:liz_pomeroy@...\">liz_pomeroy@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When my two were little I did restrict TV & was very careful what they<br/>\n&gt; watched, keeping full control of the remote.

I<br/>\nwanted to know at what point one does set limits.  Visual images can be<br/>\nimmensely disturbing for a very long time, which I know from experience.  I<br/>\naccidentally saw part of a movie several years ago that I wish I could erase<br/>\nfrom memory.  It was violent, it was pornographic (in my opinion, maybe not<br/>\neveryone&#39;s), and although I immediately left the room, the image has stayed<br/>\nwith me and I wish it wouldn&#39;t!  The thing about t.v., then, is that even<br/>\nthough a child may turn off something objectionable to them, they may have<br/>\nalready seen enough of it to disturb them for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We had very limited television when I grew up.

She isn&#39;t saying you did only to think<br/>\nabout why it&#39;s used as a tactic in trying to make a point. In the face of<br/>\npeople who are successfully and without dire consequences doing what we fear<br/>\nto do, why do we cling to extreme examples?

I wanted to know at what point one does set limits.  Visual images can be immensely disturbing for a very long time, which I know from experience.  I accidentally saw part of a movie several years ago that I wish I could erase from memory.
