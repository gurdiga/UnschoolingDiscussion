And on one song Ms. Lauper plays recorder, so now Holly thinks <br/>\nmy recorder playing is cooler.   And maybe, who knows, Holly will make her <br/>\nliving by being a Cyndi Lauper impersonator when she grows up, and those <br/>\nhours spent singing along and memorizing the dance steps on the videos is <br/>\nmore important to her than a chemistry class to a pharmacist.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly was asking me what pharmacists do.  I told her, and told her <br/>\nthat not long ago they were required to study Latin and doctors and <br/>\npharmacists communicated by secret and universal &quot;code,&quot; but now they pretty <br/>\nmuch only dispense pre-made medicines from factories and advise on side <br/>\neffect.   And that comes off the computer.  So anyone want to defend the <br/>\ncurrent educational requirements for dispensing pharmacists??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59009,"nextTopicId":58867}}
