It was<br/>\n&quot;feel better&quot; tea. Like vitamins. He didn&#39;t really<br/>\nlike it, I don&#39;t think, or maybe he was just being<br/>\ncontrary, who knows, but I just told him it wasn&#39;t an<br/>\noption. It was like taking a spoonful of yucky<br/>\nmedicine, only it was taking 6 sips of tea.... then a<br/>\nlittle bit later 6 more sips...then I really got into<br/>\nthis honey kick (honey garlic and onions...I&#39;m very<br/>\ninto them)...and started telling him there was alot of<br/>\nhoney in the bottom...so he would take bigger &quot;sips&quot;<br/>\nto get there. Sometimes, he would take 6 and then I<br/>\nwoudl take 6 (very little ones for me...leaves more<br/>\nfor him) and now he just drinks it. Loves it. Dd (3)<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like anything near her mouth that is warm (a<br/>\nbit of a burn-fear freak that way) and so I started<br/>\nher with making up double strength hot tea and putting<br/>\nsome honey and ice in her sippy cup thing and then<br/>\npouring the tea over them and shaking it up til the<br/>\nice melted and it was a nice room temperature drink<br/>\nthat was sweet and she gobbled it down like juice. <br/>\nAlso you could make iced tea or sun tea (some non<br/>\ncaffenated one) and just add a couple sleepytime bags<br/>\nin with the mix, serve it with dinner.
