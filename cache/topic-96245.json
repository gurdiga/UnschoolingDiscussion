They whip their own 4 month old (p.9). They recommend whipping the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bare <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; skin of &quot;every child&quot; (p.2) for &quot;Christians and non-Christians&quot; (p.5) and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;every transgression&quot; (p.1).

On p.79 they recommend whipping a 7 month old for <br/>\n&gt; screaming.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  3) On p.65 co-author Debi Pearl whips the bare leg of a 15 month old she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; babysitting, 10 separate times, for not playing with something she tells <br/>\n </span></blockquote>him <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to play with.

Give him more of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>same.&quot; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They say to continue whipping until their crying turns into a &quot;wounded, <br/>\n&gt; submissive whimper.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 8) On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being whipped, <br/>\n&gt; whip them anyway. And &quot;if you have to sit on him to spank him,then do not <br/>\n&gt; hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bigger, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tougher.&quot; &quot;Defeat him totally.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 9) On p.47 they recommend their various whips, including &quot;a belt or larger <br/>\n&gt; tree branch&quot; to hit children. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 10) The Pearls also recommend ignoring an infant&#39;s bumped head when he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>falls <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86).
