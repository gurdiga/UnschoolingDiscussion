She and her family are fine. Hardly  any <br/>\ndamage to their house and stuff---except for a massive amount of trash and  <br/>\ndebris in the yard. Phone works, but no power still---and maybe not for a <br/>\nwhile.  They&#39;re making do and are happy to be safe and to have a house to come home <br/>\n to.<br/>\n <br/>\nHer family is not in need, but they are busy helping others.<br/>\n <br/>\nDowned trees are the biggest problem. There are no chainsaws available for  <br/>\nsale (as would be expected! They&#39;re sold before they even get to the stores!).  <br/>\nIf anyone has a chainsaw you&#39;re willing to send down via UPS, Ren says that  <br/>\nwould be wonderful. She&#39;ll UPS it back as soon as things are cleaned up.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlthough she was lucky, there are many others not-so-lucky. Another  <br/>\nunschooling family is having a VERY rough go. Bankruptcy earlier this year. He  lost <br/>\nhis job. Their house was ruined---still has a huge tree splitting it in  half. <br/>\nThey couldn&#39;t afford to leave, so they had to stay in the house. The tree  <br/>\nfell WHILE THEY WERE HOME during Ivan! They&#39;re physically fine, but everything&#39;s  <br/>\nlost.<br/>\n <br/>\nRen&#39;s asking for monetary help for this family. If you are able to share  <br/>\nwith them, please send a check to Ren---she&#39;ll get it to this family. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnother family of homeschoolers was hit---but not as bad as the first  <br/>\nfamily. Ren will do what she can for both.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe says thanks for all the good wishes and for whatever help you can  afford <br/>\nto send. She&#39;s overwhelmed with your concern and generosity!<br/>\n <br/>\nHer address:<br/>\nRen Allen<br/>\n5210 Spring Hill Rd<br/>\nPensacola, FL 32503<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99524,"nextTopicId":99466}}
