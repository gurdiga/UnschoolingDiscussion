The good news is that a new, national-level homeschooling","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1170923725\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nGot some good news and some bad news here concerning homelearning <br/>\ndevelopments in Japan....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is that a new, national-level homeschooling &quot;support <br/>\nassociation&quot; has been formed recently in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad news is that homelearners on the whole in Japan are not exactly <br/>\nout dancing in the streets in celebration of this new organization.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not? Well, while it is true that the new Homeschool Support <br/>\nAssociation of Japan, or HoSA, which is located (in Japanese) at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschool.ne.jp/\">http://www.homeschool.ne.jp/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nis indeed a nonprofit organization targeting homelearners, it is also <br/>\ntrue that this new association was essentially &quot;created&quot; by a private, <br/>\nfor-profit corporation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis private, for-profit corporation is the Atmark Inter-Highschool, <br/>\nlocated....<br/>\n<br/>\n--in Japanese at:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inter-highschool.ne.jp/\">http://www.inter-highschool.ne.jp/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n--in English at:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inter-highschool.ne.jp/eng/index.html\">http://www.inter-highschool.ne.jp/eng/index.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n(Interestingly enough, Atmark prominently advertises and offers a direct <br/>\nlink to this new Homeschool Support Association on the company&#39;s <br/>\nJapanese-language website link above -- but not on its above <br/>\nEnglish-language website.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Atmark company, as some of you may have heard, is a relative newcomer <br/>\non the business scene in Japan. It was formed in spring of this year. <br/>\nAtmark, under its leader -- a Japanese businessman named Mr. Kozo Hino  <br/>\n-- is marketing itself as offering an American-style education and a <br/>\nUS-recognized diploma once Japanese students finish their courses (which <br/>\nare conducted primarily on the Internet).<br/>\n<br/>\nAtmark can promote itself as such because it has made a tie-up with the <br/>\nAlger Learning Center & Independence High School, based in Washington <br/>\nstate, USA. Alger&#39;s website is located at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.independent-learning.com/\">http://www.independent-learning.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlger advertises itself in major homeschooling magazines in the US as a <br/>\n&quot;Washington State Approved Private School K-12&quot; and, indeed, appears to <br/>\nbe an officially recognized institution of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlger&#39;s Japanese partner, Atmark, however, enjoys no such status in <br/>\nJapan. Atmark definitely *is not* recognized academically in Japan by the <br/>\nMinistry of Education or any other educational body in this country. The <br/>\ndiploma that Japanese high school students receive from Atmark may be <br/>\ncertifiably recognized in Washington state in the US, but it is not <br/>\nrecognized anywhere in Japan. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo put it bluntly, Atmark is nothing more than a private business in <br/>\nJapan, and like all other private businesses anywhere, it is bound only <br/>\nby the limitations of the free market. This type of business-education <br/>\n&quot;marriage&quot; of Atmark and Alger is common -- and has been common for many <br/>\nyears now -- among so-called educational joint ventures between the US <br/>\nand Japan. Sometimes with disastrous results.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is why homelearners in Japan on the whole seem to be so <br/>\nsuspicious and mistrustful now of Atmark&#39;s very quick moves to create <br/>\nthis national Homeschooling Support Association here in Japan. It is <br/>\nobvious that profit is the guiding motivation here, not moral concern for <br/>\nthe plight of those who desire to learn at home. And in return, there <br/>\nappears to be little, if any, meaningful support among the grassroots <br/>\nhomelearning community in Japan for Atmark&#39;s new creation, the Homeschool <br/>\nSupport Association of Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne cannot help but seriously wonder, at this stage, if the new <br/>\nHomeschool Support Association of Japan is, in fact, anything more than a <br/>\nnonprofit PR organ for the Atmark corporation itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd speaking of PR: This new &quot;support association&quot; in Japan has only been <br/>\nin existence a matter of weeks, and yet it already has allied itself with <br/>\nsome very controversial and powerful friends: On 29 July 2000, Atmark&#39;s <br/>\nnew Homeschool Support Association of Japan will celebrate its auspicious <br/>\ndebut by holding a symposium in Tokyo and inviting Mr. Christopher <br/>\nKlicka, senior counsel of the US-based Home School Legal Defense <br/>\nAssociation (HSLDA), as a special guest. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor more details on Atmark, this new &quot;support association&quot; and the <br/>\nJapanese educational market, take a look at a critical review by Aileen <br/>\nKawagoe, a homelearning parent in Japan and editor of a newsletter on the <br/>\n&quot;Homeschooling in Japan&quot; website. The URL to Aileen&#39;s very thorough <br/>\nwrite-up is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.gol.com/users/milkat/june00.html\">http://www2.gol.com/users/milkat/june00.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n....and continues on at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.gol.com/users/milkat/june00_2.html#starting\">http://www2.gol.com/users/milkat/june00_2.html#starting</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to keep you posted regularly on future developments with this <br/>\nnew &quot;support association&quot; here in Japan. Aileen&#39;s review is a very good <br/>\nplace to start in the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian Covert<br/>\n(KnoK NEWS)<br/>\nin Osaka, Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10692,"nextTopicId":10701}}
