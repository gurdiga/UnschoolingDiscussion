I felt very &quot;blocked&quot; and heavy<br/>\nand was having trouble thinking or communicating clearly - either on line or<br/>\nto the people in my life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found that I gained great sense of relief and release by sitting down for<br/>\na long uninterrupted session with my laptop and writing all I could remember<br/>\nabout my mother&#39;s life and my own childhood with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case it was a process of getting rid of a lot of negativity and<br/>\nreleasing anger and resentments. However recording joys and recollections of<br/>\ncloseness might also be as freeing. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me it was a case of getting this stuff out of my head, and onto &quot;paper&quot;,<br/>\nso that my thinking was released - my brain ceased feeling like it was<br/>\nstuffed with marshmallow the second I hit the final period. I was able to<br/>\nstart talking to others, and thinking logically again. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this lady is mourning and is as blocked as I was, she may be relying on<br/>\nold routines and conventions to help her feel secure. She may be simply<br/>\nunable, yet, to accept new ideas of any sort. Her son needs his time to<br/>\nmourn also, including being angry and going through a period of questioning<br/>\nor feeling everything is &quot;pointless&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf she is trying to force him to be &quot;normal&quot; because of her need for<br/>\nnormalcy, his mourning may last longer (like short circuiting deschooling<br/>\nwith &quot;suggestions&quot;). I think he will fight for autonomy because of his need<br/>\nto mourn in his own way. However perhaps they both feel if they can just<br/>\nhold on in their different ways until the summer break, that may provide an<br/>\nanticipated and comfortable change in routine that will let them both mourn<br/>\nfully. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I got a<br/>\ngreat number of wonderful entries -- far too many to publish.<br/>\nToday&#39;s column is the first of two. Here are half of the top<br/>\nentries, this week&#39;s winners, and my comments interspersed. Here<br/>\ncome the comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Kara Becker:<br/>\nOur realtor learned we were home schooling. She commented about<br/>\nthe lack of social development that would result, but tried to still<br/>\nbe positive by adding, &quot;Even though they couldn&#39;t be realtors, thank<br/>\ngoodness that there are lot of jobs out there which don&#39;t require<br/>\npeople skills.&quot;<br/>\nMike: Thank you, Dale Carnegie (author of &quot;How to Win Friends and<br/>\nInfluence People&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the Austin family:<br/>\nA stranger said, &quot;Don&#39;t you think your children are being deprived of<br/>\nthe thrill of buying school supplies at Wal-Mart when everyone else<br/>\ndoes?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Angela Blackman:<br/>\nA friend who is a paralegal at a very busy law firm said, &quot;How can<br/>\nyou ever think you can keep up with having four kids at home?<br/>\nDon&#39;t they just run you off your feet? I&#39;d be exhausted by the end<br/>\nof the day.&quot;<br/>\nMike: It is a proven fact that assisting two lawyers is the<br/>\nequivalent of having six kids or else tending a dozen snakes --<br/>\ndepending on the age of the lawyer.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Pamela Minerd:<br/>\nMy father asked, &quot;Will I have to bail you out of jail for this?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom MDT:<br/>\nMy neighbor was picking my brain about getting the public school to<br/>\nchallenge her first grader. She was concerned because my first<br/>\ngrader was already reading while her son of the same age was just<br/>\nlearning the sounds of letters. Nonetheless she challenged my home<br/>\nschooling saying my son would still miss out. &quot;It&#39;s important for<br/>\nhim socially too. He needs to be offered drugs so he can turn them<br/>\ndown.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Marci Zinn:<br/>\nA family member said, &quot;You are just doing this for yourself so you<br/>\nwon&#39;t have to buy the kids any school clothes.&quot;<br/>\nMike: Working 8+ hours a day for 12+ years just smacks of selfishness<br/>\nif you ask me.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom MDT:<br/>\nA friend asked, &quot;Do you use books?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Rose Mary Coffey:<br/>\nWhen my husband told his mother that we were going to home school,<br/>\nshe replied, &quot;What makes Rose Mary think she has the right to teach<br/>\nmy grandchildren?&quot;<br/>\nMike: It&#39;s in the same clause of the Constitution which gives<br/>\ngrandmas the right to feed cookies and candy to the grandkids an<br/>\nhour before being sent home for dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the Karoutsos Family:<br/>\nMy six year old son was very fidgety in the dentist&#39;s chair.<br/>\nAfterwards the dentist spoke to me and told me of his fidgetiness<br/>\nand said, &quot;Your son did not sit still. It is possibly due to the<br/>\nfact that you home school him.&quot;<br/>\nMike: I guess he thought that dentistry was so boring he would branch<br/>\nout into child psychology.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Pam Hynes:<br/>\nI told an old friend from high school how my son was able to progress<br/>\nin each subject at his own rate. She earnestly replied, &quot;What if he<br/>\nlearns it all before he finishes high school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the Austin family:<br/>\nA female public school teacher said, &quot;Your son will turn out to be<br/>\nmuch too feminine or gay because you home school him. Being with<br/>\nhis mother so much is not good for boys.&quot;<br/>\nMike: I guess that spending ages 5 through 12 with female public<br/>\nschool teachers would be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Laurie Winkelmann:<br/>\nI took my daughter to a podiatrist who specialized in treating<br/>\nplantar warts. I asked how children contracted these warts. He<br/>\ntold me that they often come from locker rooms or swimming pools.<br/>\nWhen I told him that since we home school it wouldn&#39;t be a locker<br/>\nroom, but we do take a swimming class, he replied, &quot;Yup, home<br/>\nschooling, that certainly explains it.&quot;<br/>\nMike: Sounds like someone needs to breath a little fresh air between<br/>\nfoot examinations.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Dawn Howey:<br/>\nA Christian friend, &quot;God didn&#39;t homeschool Jesus, He sent Him away<br/>\nto school.&quot;<br/>\nMike: I think the friend needs to be sent away to Sunday School.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Susan Shay:<br/>\n&quot;Won&#39;t they miss out on learning a lot of important stuff? I mean,<br/>\nhow will they ever learn to stand in line?&quot; (Similar statements<br/>\nwere made to Gita Schmitz and Kathi Kearney. All three get tapes.)<br/>\nMike: Thank goodness for the rigorous standards of Goals 2000.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Tracy Pina:<br/>\nAn acquaintance said, &quot;Every kid has to get beat up a few times in<br/>\npublic school or they won&#39;t be able to cope in the real world.&quot;<br/>\nMike: Sticks and stones will break my bones or else I won&#39;t be well<br/>\nrounded.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Clarence and Barbara Hawkins:<br/>\nA home school family in our town took their school days off in the<br/>\nmiddle of the week to match the father&#39;s job schedule. Some nosey<br/>\nneighbors had the family investigated for home schooling on Saturday!<br/>\nMike: Reminds me of the social services case I had in Alabama where a<br/>\nmother was hotlined for allowing her children to read books in the<br/>\nback of the van while she drove around town.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom MDT:<br/>\nA friend said, &quot;MY child is being a light in a dark place, but I<br/>\nguess SOME children are not able to do that.&quot;<br/>\nMike: With that much condescension that lady probably fogs up her<br/>\nown glasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Michelle Nichols:<br/>\nA woman asked a home school friend of mine, &quot;If you don&#39;t send your<br/>\nchildren to school, who is going to teach them their morals?&quot;<br/>\nMike: Yeah, like the moral necessity of beating up other kids on the<br/>\nplayground if we are to believe another comment we read.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Barb Palmer:<br/>\nOur girls&#39; friends from the neighborhood ask, &quot;If you are home<br/>\nschooled, who teaches you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the Austin family:<br/>\nA friend said, &quot;Won&#39;t your children miss the experience of the goods<br/>\nand bads of dating people from other cultural and religious<br/>\nbackgrounds?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Char Brady:<br/>\nA mother from my daughter&#39;s former public school class said, &quot;If you<br/>\nwere more involved in your child&#39;s education, then you wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nto home school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom MDT:<br/>\nAn acquaintance asked, &quot;How can you possibly give them enough<br/>\none-on-one time?&quot;<br/>\nMike (stolen from MDT): I guess the kids would get more one-on-one<br/>\ntime in a classroom of 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom &quot;Ozchick&quot;:<br/>\nA friend asked me what we were going to do during a public school<br/>\nsnow day. I replied that we were going ahead with school. The friend<br/>\nreplied, &quot;That&#39;s silly. Why make your kids work since no one will be<br/>\naround to grade their papers?&quot; Not to be outdone, that same friend<br/>\nheard me describe how I was teaching my children baking from the<br/>\nColonial period. A recent project was making a cake from<br/>\nscratch. She replied, &quot;Where can I buy a box of scratch,<br/>\nI&#39;ve never heard of it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Nancy Persaud<br/>\n(although this comment is not within the rules of the contest as<br/>\nNancy recognized, it is too good to pass up): From a 5th grade<br/>\ngeography textbook, &quot;Maps are smaller than the areas they represent.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Dana Estes:<br/>\nA friend said, &quot;I could NEVER home school my children. I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine spending that much time with them.&quot; She is a public school<br/>\nteacher.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106248,"nextTopicId":106518}}
