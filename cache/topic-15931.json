Farm Web","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2085713602\">Hello everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the need to share our wonderful experience this past week at the <br/>\nUnschooling Rural Oasis at Winona Farm in Winona Minnesota. Farm Web Site: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.nbci.com/winfarm/index2.htm\">http://members.nbci.com/winfarm/index2.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you live anywhere near Winona, try to make it over there!  Dick and Sue <br/>\nare two of the most fascinating people we have ever had the pleasure to <br/>\nmeet!  Dick Gallien is a man that has been many places and has done many <br/>\nthings and has some great stories to tell.  Sue (who I just noticed is on <br/>\nthis list, HI SUE!!) is Dicks partner and after nine kids has seen <br/>\neverything I think.  The four kids that live there now were fun to hang out <br/>\nwith (tell them that Ian and Riley miss them terribly already!!).  We spent <br/>\nquite a few evenings sitting around with the kids sipping hot cocoa and <br/>\nwatching them play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe farm itself is almost its own living organism.  It really has a life of <br/>\nits own.  There was so much to learn!!  Scott and I got a real taste of <br/>\nwhat it is to be unschoolers ourselves too, which was most eye <br/>\nopening.  Dick and Sue did not hold our hands and drag us around, but gave <br/>\nus space to take it all in, think about things, ask questions, and do <br/>\nthings on our own.  It was such a nice change of pace!!  Scott and I felt <br/>\nlike kids ourselves with of the questions we had and things we had to <br/>\nlearn.  We learned about composting, animal gestations, farm equipment, the <br/>\nimportance of returning what we take from the earth, recycling of all <br/>\nkinds, and what it feels like to do work, and not just a job.  We also <br/>\nlearned that chickens will eat just about anything, including chicken (we <br/>\ncity folks had assumed that chickens were vegetarians, lol!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids had a fun time sledding, snowboarding, collecting eggs, and <br/>\nplaying with the other kids.  Riley got to ride on a goat (she fell in love <br/>\nwith the goats!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me put it this way:  If we had another 8 days to take a vacation and <br/>\nhad to choose between my sisters place in Florida (where it is nice and <br/>\nwarm, and near the beach lol) and going back to see the wonderful folks at <br/>\nWinona Farm, the Farm would win hands down every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough, if you are looking for a quaint country cottage where you can sit <br/>\nsipping tea while watching the youngsters frolic in the meadows with the <br/>\nsheep, you are probably going to be disappointed.  This is a working farm, <br/>\nwhere there is a ton of work to be done and take part in.  No one is going <br/>\nto hold your hand through it all either.  Just like we leave the bulk of <br/>\nlearning up to our young unschoolers, the exact same is expected of us.  It <br/>\nwas truly a wonderful experience for our whole family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe town of Winona is GORGEOUS too.  This was our first visit to Minnesota, <br/>\nand instantly fell in love with its landscape.  I even HATED snow before <br/>\nthis visit, but now I can appreciate its beauty.  Living in a huge city <br/>\nlike St Louis, snow is usually a nightmare waiting to happen.  There it was <br/>\nalmost peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you are looking for a REAL experience and not just some manufactured <br/>\none, take a trip to meet the nice people at Winona Farm.  Open your minds <br/>\nand take in the new experience and learn along with your kids.  It is a <br/>\ngreat way to prove that we are always learning, never to old to learn <br/>\nsomething new, and that age should never be a restriction (Dick is almost <br/>\n70 and is the most agile and tenacious person I have ever met!  He makes <br/>\nmost people 1/4 his age look like slugs!!).  It is a wonderful place to <br/>\nlearn about real animals (though be warned it is NOT a petting zoo), <br/>\ncomposting, waste reductions, and just how backwards a lot of things are <br/>\ndone in our society (ie landfills, and the way we recycle waste).  If you <br/>\nare not afraid to get dirty (and you WILL get very dirty) and are open to <br/>\nnew experiences, this is worth the trip.  We drove 8 hours to get there and <br/>\nwould do it again tomorrow if my husband was not expected back at work (but <br/>\nhe works for Chrysler, so I am sure he will be laid off again soon!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else been there?
