Do you just use <br/>\n&gt; natural consequences for everything?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids who have to go to school can&#39;t stay up until 3 am and sleep <br/>\nuntil noon. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think what happens is that once you&#39;re unschooling long enough you <br/>\nstop differentiating between &quot;school&quot; or &quot;education&quot; and the rest of <br/>\nlife.  Allowing a child to learn what he wants leads naturally into <br/>\nallowing a child to eat what he wants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to learn good habits is to have a parent leading by good <br/>\nexample.  That is a real challenge for parents!  Really, it&#39;s easy <br/>\nfor me to yell at my kids and not let them get up from the table <br/>\nuntil they finish their veggies while I&#39;m standing there drinking a <br/>\ncoke and eating a cupcake.  It&#39;s much, much harder on my part to <br/>\nmodel good eating habits by not having the coke and the cupcake and <br/>\nsitting down to eat a big plate of brocolli.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think some of what people call self control and self discipline is <br/>\njust adherance to tradition.  Like telling kids that they have to get <br/>\nup and make their beds.  What is really the purpose of making beds?  <br/>\nThey just get messed up again at bedtime.  And if you don&#39;t have to <br/>\ngo anywhere the next day, why bother going to bed before midnight?  I <br/>\ndo insist that my kids brush their teeth at night.  I&#39;m not there <br/>\nyet! lol <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids still have boundaries, and those boundaries are that in our <br/>\nfamily we do not hurt each other.  For example, if someone is on the <br/>\nphone, it is rude to make so much noise that the person on the phone <br/>\ncan&#39;t hear.  It is unacceptable to knock over a tower of blocks that <br/>\nsomeone is building, or to write on someone else&#39;s picture that <br/>\nthey&#39;re drawing.  That is self control.  Learning that just because <br/>\nyou&#39;re mad doesn&#39;t give you permission to rip up someone else&#39;s <br/>\npaper.  And really, having personal boundaries is a healthy way to <br/>\nlive your life, even if you&#39;re not parenting.  You should respect <br/>\nyourself enough that you don&#39;t allow people to destroy your property <br/>\nor rudely interrupt your personal phone calls.  If you don&#39;t allow <br/>\nother people to treat you like that, you shouldn&#39;t allow your <br/>\nchildren to treat you like that either.  If you tell your <br/>\nchild, &quot;Don&#39;t color on that paper because it&#39;s real important to <br/>\nmommy&quot;, pretty soon, your kids will be telling each other, &quot;Hey, <br/>\nthat&#39;s my project, you may not destroy that&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How does religion work with unschooling?

I don&#39;t use a Bible curriculum to <br/>\ndo this though.  (I have struggled with that issue and it was the <br/>\nlast thing to remove before I could completely unschool!)

But for some people who question the need to teach their children<br/>\nmath it&#39;s a natural extension to question the need to teach their children<br/>\nanything else. If living life is enough for history, then why should<br/>\nfiguring out teeth brushing be any different?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people who try not limiting TV or food or bedtimes find that kids do<br/>\nself regulate after a few weeks or months. (They *will* glut for a while<br/>\nbecause they want whatever it was that was previously forbidden and<br/>\nunconsciously assume the controls will reappear so they need to take as much<br/>\nadvantage of the freedom as possible.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids *won&#39;t* make the same choices we would. But they won&#39;t do nothing<br/>\nbut whatever we fear they will.<br/>\n<br/>\n(It&#39;s *much* easier to discuss this around real problems rather than<br/>\ngeneralizations and what-if scenarios. Generalizations tend to gloss over<br/>\nrealities and what-ifs tend to get what-if&#39;d to death.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that&#39;s tough to get across in discussions like this is our own<br/>\nwants and needs. What we need to relearn are what are our real boundaries<br/>\nand what are the controls we&#39;re trying to impose on others just to make our<br/>\nlives easier. One way of helping us see the difference is by asking how we&#39;d<br/>\ntreat a friend in the same situation. We might be upset if our kids had been<br/>\nwatching TV for 6 hours straight but we&#39;d generally give the benefit of the<br/>\ndoubt to the friend that they were doing what they wanted to do and we<br/>\nshould go find a life for ourselves and not bother them ;-) (But since as<br/>\nunschooling parents we&#39;re responsible for our children&#39;s environment, if<br/>\nthey&#39;re watching that much TV everyday then we should make sure they have<br/>\nother options that are equally enticing and not just choosing TV because<br/>\nit&#39;s the best option available.) But if our kids wouldn&#39;t give up the TV so<br/>\nwe could watch the one program we liked then that&#39;s an issue of respect for<br/>\nother people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So if these are part of unschooling how do they learn self-<br/>\n&gt; discipline, self-control and good life habits? Do you just use<br/>\n&gt; natural consequences for everything?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Modeling. Talking to them about why we make the decisions we do (rather than<br/>\nwhy they should make the decision). Talking to them about how something make<br/>\nus feel. Letting them try things out. Helping them by making some things<br/>\nless odious. Making sure there are other options besides what they&#39;re<br/>\nchoosing. Realizing that as competent as they may seem, that perhaps they<br/>\nreally aren&#39;t as ready as we assume they are. (Like with the blueberries!<br/>\n;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a practice is good, then do we need to train kids to do them or will they<br/>\ndo them because they make sense? (Though not necessarily right away or on<br/>\n*our* time schedule!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I&#39;ve always brushed my teeth with my daughter. I remember<br/>\nbrushing teeth as a child to be a long lonely tedious process so by doing it<br/>\nwith her, I remove that one objection. It was also difficult because it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t automatic so a child is conscious of doing it. By doing it together<br/>\nmy daughter gets a social time which takes her mind off the tediousness of<br/>\nit. She&#39;s rarely chosen not to brush partly because she&#39;d give up that<br/>\nsocial time. And skipping once or twice or even a whole week isn&#39;t going to<br/>\ngive her cavities. It&#39;s habitually not brushing that will cause cavities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or do you say &quot;this is what I believe and some people<br/>\n&gt; believe such and such, and in your life the choice is yours what you<br/>\n&gt; choose to believe&quot; or something like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do. But others don&#39;t. For some people unschooling stops with academics.<br/>\nFor others it goes beyond that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing what unschoolers do and not doing what unschoolers don&#39;t do is<br/>\nprobably how many people begin unschooling. But it won&#39;t get someone very<br/>\nfar because from a school mindset or conventional parenting mindset<br/>\nunschooling doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense! It just flies in the face of<br/>\nconventional wisdom. So a helpful next step is to question our assumptions<br/>\nabout how things need to be so we can *understand* unschooling and how human<br/>\nbeing work.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":104758277,"authorName":"zandaniel","from":"&quot;zandaniel&quot; &lt;zandaniel@...&gt;","profile":"zandaniel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"just a question or 2?","postDate":"1029734325","msgId":41406,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFqcHYzbCt1ZjA0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41407,"prevInTime":41405,"nextInTime":41407,"topicId":41406,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi guys Been lurking on the list for a couple of months now but haven t posted since my stop scaring the newbie post which caused such a riot.
