As a matter of fact, I will right now.. lol<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna had her first real &quot;job&quot; tonight.. Well, she has babysat for neices and <br/>\nnephews plenty of times, but tonight she watched some &quot;non family&quot; kids.    A <br/>\nmother from our play group asked if she would like to watch some children <br/>\nduring Bible Study at thier church.   She watched 5 kids, ages 1-6, and she <br/>\nmade $10 for about and and half.    She really enjoyed it.   Tomorrow she is <br/>\ngoing over to one of the parents home to help her for a little while.  She is <br/>\nvery excited.
