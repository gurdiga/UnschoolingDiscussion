How<br/>\nare <br/>\nthey on smell, hamster cages stink! TIA, Lynn F&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLike someone already said you have probably been seeing pet store rats<br/>\nand/or rats that aren&#39;t played with enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRats can be litter trained by from what I&#39;ve read it&#39;s more a case of<br/>\nencouraging a natural tendency.  Some rats are more likely to be<br/>\nselective in where they go potty than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur rats don&#39;t smell bad as long as we clean their cage AT LEAST once a<br/>\nweek.  We use aspen bedding, it still helps with odor but doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nthe nasty oils in pine and cedar.  We tried the recycled newspaper<br/>\nbedding once but it was awful, it almost smelled like a dirty cage new in<br/>\nthe bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne good breeder uses alfalfa pellets, she says that since her ratties<br/>\nalways use the same corner to pee she just scoops up the pellets that<br/>\nhave disintegrated from being wet every day.  Then she dumps the whole<br/>\ncage of litter every week, I&#39;m going to try this next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also give our girls a bath about once a month.  We put them in a deep<br/>\nrubbermaid storage bucket with just a couple inches of warm water and bit<br/>\nof mild soap, this way they can still touch bottom.  It&#39;s not their<br/>\nfavorite activity but they don&#39;t seem to suffer from PTSD either.  We<br/>\njust rub them a bit (especially their tails) and then rinse them off with<br/>\nwarm water.  We all hold one of them, rub it dry and then put them back<br/>\nin their clean cage where they fluff and dry themselves the rest of the<br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of our would take his ratties into the shower with them, they<br/>\nseemed to love that.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today\r<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!\r<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48260,"nextTopicId":48312}}
