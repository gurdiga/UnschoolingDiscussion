I tend to get very opinionated myself and while I enjoy being stretched on occasion I also know my limits of what topics I feel strongly enough about that its best just to stay away.  After 6 years of being online it has been a long road of learning that.  I feel that I&#39;m in the minority here in a lot of my belief systems but I&#39;m willing to overlook the differences in religion, politics, parenting styles in order to gain some input on unschooling.  Sometimes I feel like unsubscribing, sometimes I do unsubscribe, but I always come back when I&#39;m in a place where I feel I need the support.  I have gone from that &quot;I&#39;m an unschooler, but we have certain things to do&quot; to total unschooling ( although I digress once or twice a year for a week or so) and I can see both sides of the &quot;what is unschooling&quot; coin.  I tend to lean more toward letting everyone have their own definition of what unschooling is to them personally, but I also see the point in not claiming to be something your not.......haven&#39;t really come to any definite answers on that one but one thing I would like to see on this list is a little more tolerance toward people who may call themselves unschoolers but don&#39;t go &quot;whole hog&quot; into the unschooling philosophy......I think there are better ways of getting your point across than saying &quot;this list isn&#39;t for you&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re wrong&quot;.......all you do is push people away...you don&#39;t give them anything to think about, you give them no options but to get defensive or hurt most of the time.  I would like to see a more......&quot;well let&#39;s talk about what your definition of unschooling is&quot; type of answer......of course that is just me and I wouldn&#39;t expect everyone to change their ways, but I think some tolerance would go a long way.<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Helen Hegener <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, September 08, 2001 10:13 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Abandon ship!
