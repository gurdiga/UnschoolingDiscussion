But even I have to agree that <br/>\nit IS sometimes pretty funny. At the LEAST, they prompt discussions on the <br/>\nsituations and reactions----and that large vocabulary! Now, Cow and Chicken? <br/>\nwell, I STILL haven&#39;t found anything redeeming about THAT one! &lt;G&gt; But Duncan <br/>\ngutgiggles all through it----so at least HE finds it entertaining! THAT&#39;s the <br/>\nredeeming quality!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The <br/>\n </span></blockquote>fairly oddparents really gets under my skin and that one we do not <br/>\nallow because I think he is too young.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, *I* happen to LIKE Fairly Oddparents! &lt;G&gt; Go figure!

At this point I feel the only <br/>\nreason he is watching is because it is on cartoon network.  I have <br/>\ntried to discuss that just because it is on that channel does not <br/>\nmean it is a good choice.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell first off,  the words &quot;intelligent choice&quot; kind of  makes me feel icky. <br/>\nIt&#39;s just a choice. Is there NOTHING better on?  To HIM? Then he&#39;s making a <br/>\nchoice that&#39;s important to him at the time. Duncan did the cartoonnetwork ONLY <br/>\nfor a couple of years, so I&#39;ve been there. He&#39;s seven now----and his choices <br/>\nare becoming more &quot;refined&quot; and more &quot;mature&quot;----but I wouldn&#39;t say they&#39;re <br/>\nnecessarily more (or less) &quot;intelligent&quot;. There&#39;s *something* he&#39;s getting out of <br/>\nCartoon Network that YOU&#39;re not seeing.
