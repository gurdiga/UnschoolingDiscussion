Beyond that......<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good and<br/>\n&gt;right.  That they would have a deep seated knowledge in their hearts that<br/>\n&gt;they are intelligent, capable human beings and can learn anything they wish.<br/>\n&gt;A sense of wonder so awesome that they will never quit seeing how magical the<br/>\n&gt;world truly is.

I came out of HS battered emotionally, not<br/>\n&gt;knowing who I was or what I really wanted. And 15 years later, I am spouting<br/>\n&gt;of ideals for my children that I couldn&#39;t have dreamed of at the time.<br/>\n&gt;I will help that along by becoming a better person myself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By reading, watching, searching and regaining that sense of wonder (they&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;helped me do this already). By delving deep into questions and not pretending<br/>\n&gt;like I know more than them. By being willing to set everything aside, change<br/>\n&gt;plans midstream and go off in a new direction when necessary. By listening<br/>\n&gt;carefully and responding appropriately.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By respecting these amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the inner<br/>\n&gt;knowledge they already posess.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love to the<br/>\n&gt;earth and my fellow human beings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, toys, art<br/>\n&gt;materials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never knew<br/>\n&gt;existed. By fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries and<br/>\n&gt;making trips to the grocery store an adventure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By making every day an adventure, by my attitude, every mundane chore or<br/>\n&gt;daily activity sacred by how I approach it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Healing myself has definitely been the most important step in assisting these<br/>\n&gt;worthy individuals in their unschooling journey.

Beyond that......<br/>\n<br/>\nThat the status quo will not matter so much to them as what is good and <br/>\nright.  That they would have a deep seated knowledge in their hearts that <br/>\nthey are intelligent, capable human beings and can learn anything they wish.<br/>\nA sense of wonder so awesome that they will never quit seeing how magical the <br/>\nworld truly is.  Be idealistic tempered with realistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpirituality that flows naturally and freely from a loving heart and kindness <br/>\nrare.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability to follow their dreams and goals, whatever those may be.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And how do you plan to help that along?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt humbles me to think about this. I came out of HS battered emotionally, not <br/>\nknowing who I was or what I really wanted. And 15 years later, I am spouting <br/>\nof ideals for my children that I couldn&#39;t have dreamed of at the time. <br/>\nI will help that along by becoming a better person myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy reading, watching, searching and regaining that sense of wonder (they&#39;ve <br/>\nhelped me do this already). By delving deep into questions and not pretending <br/>\nlike I know more than them. By being willing to set everything aside, change <br/>\nplans midstream and go off in a new direction when necessary. By listening <br/>\ncarefully and responding appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy respecting these amazing beings I&#39;ve been entrusted with and the inner <br/>\nknowledge they already posess.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy dialoguing with them, these matters of the heart and showing love to the <br/>\nearth and my fellow human beings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy filling my home with books, movies, music, instruments, nature, toys, art <br/>\nmaterials and whatever oddities my children bring home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy taking them to the places they want to go and ones they never knew <br/>\nexisted. By fixing them new and exciting foods from other countries and <br/>\nmaking trips to the grocery store an adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy making every day an adventure, by my attitude, every mundane chore or <br/>\ndaily activity sacred by how I approach it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealing myself has definitely been the most important step in assisting these <br/>\nworthy individuals in their unschooling journey. I have learned much from <br/>\nthem, thank the heavens they came here to teach me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37136,"nextTopicId":37149}}
