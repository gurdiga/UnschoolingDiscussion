For Christmas, he&#39;d planned to buy <br/>\nnew bicycles for his kids, he has 2, a boy and a girl.  <br/>\nHe phoned some folk who&#39;d put ads in the local paper, <br/>\ngot a decent bike for his son from someone who lived a <br/>\nfew doors away, but he had to travel a little further <br/>\nafield for his daughter.  When he got to the first <br/>\nhouse, he was met by an apologetic man, who told him <br/>\nthat his time had been wasted.<br/>\n&quot;I can&#39;t possibly sell you this bike, it&#39;s knackered!  <br/>\nIf you want it, take it!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Errr, OK&quot; our friend replied.  The bike turned out to <br/>\nbe rather mucky, slightly scratched and the back braked <br/>\nwere seized up.  But it was a very good quality frame <br/>\nwith an 18speed gear set.  He eventually paid £5 for <br/>\nit.  A little elbow grease and T-cut, and a new set of <br/>\nback brakes, and he has two perfectly good bikes for <br/>\nhis children, for a little over £60.  They&#39;d&#39;ve cost At <br/>\nleast £100 pounds each new, probably a lot more for the <br/>\ngirl&#39;s bike. <br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha\u000f<br/>\nWho loves to shop but a garage sales and thrift stores\u000f<br/>\nand holds Amy Dacyzn as her heroine.\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nHi Samantha,\u000f<br/>\n\u000f<br/>\nI miss the Frugal Zealot (Amy D. of The Tightwad <br/>\nGazette)...I subscribed to\u000f<br/>\nthe newsletter and have all 3 books.
