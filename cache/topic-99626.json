I was at my first local homeschooling meeting <br/>\nof the year yesterday.  There was a new family there that just <br/>\npulled their pre-teens out of school.  One of the mom&#39;s said, &quot;Oh, <br/>\ndon&#39;t forget to sign up for HSLDA.  Better to be safe than sorry.&quot;  <br/>\nThen all the other mom&#39;s nodded their heads in agreement with her.  <br/>\nI said, &quot;I just keep the phone number of a few umbrella schools on <br/>\nhand.  If the school dept ever gave me a hard time, I&#39;d just join <br/>\none of them and be considered a private schooler.&quot;  I got the &quot;your <br/>\nputting your life in jeopardy!&quot; looks.
