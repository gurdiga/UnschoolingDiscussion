They are fun but not such a good<br/>\n&gt;intro to the beauty that opera can have.<br/>\n&gt;I think kids will like  to hear The Three Tenors, and now there is a newer<br/>\n&gt;trio called the Three Mo&#39; Tenors. They sing a more Jazzy style, mixing <br/>\n&gt;blues,<br/>\n&gt;jazz and opera.<br/>\n&gt;If your local TV stations will show the &quot;Pageant of Peace&quot; White house Xmas<br/>\n&gt;tree lighting, they will be performing. Also on the bill are Sandra&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;favorite &quot;new age poofs&quot; Manaheim Steamroller.<br/>\n&gt;Elissa<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
