I gradually came to<br/>\nfeel it was very difficult unless you were alone a lot, had time and space<br/>\nto yourself, were free of the need to attend other people&#39;s urgencies all<br/>\nthe time - or the urgencies of a commercial world. How can you expect to be<br/>\nunique if every minute you draw models from other people and the shadows of<br/>\nother people drawn from television? How can the unique destiny that is in<br/>\nevery one of us exercise itself if you always submit to the scrutiny and<br/>\njudgment of authorities? Authorities on what? Certainly not on you unless<br/>\nyou have been diminished into something predictable, tamed by regulation,<br/>\nsimplification, and rationalization. A steady diet of that will waste all<br/>\nyour time.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.life.ca/nl/45/gatto.html\">http://www.life.ca/nl/45/gatto.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4840,"nextTopicId":4844}}
