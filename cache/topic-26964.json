My husband comes from a family that<br/>\ndoes believe in<br/>\nvery specific gender roles (men are the rulers and wage<br/>\nearners and women<br/>\nare the longsuffering house servants).  I don&#39;t.  I had<br/>\nthought we had come a long way until<br/>\nrecently when my daughter said something about &quot;yeah, but<br/>\nhe&#39;s a man.  Men <br/>\naren&#39;t supposed to clean the house. Men do the working.&quot;  I<br/>\nalmost passed out.  I was like &#39;I&#39;m sorry, <br/>\nare you new here?!<br/>\nSo I guess we have more work to do :)  I was in shock. But<br/>\nI realized afterwards<br/>\nthat she has only known me as  a stay at home Mommy.  Mommy<br/>\nwho is the primary caregiver and is<br/>\nalways with her (remember I work from home) while Papa goes<br/>\nout to work.  Mommy <br/>\nwho does all the cooking and cleaning.  I tried to explain<br/>\nto her that Papa and I agreed <br/>\nlong ago that we would each do what needs doing when we can<br/>\ndo it.   I do the cooking<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m here and in a position to do it - if I were<br/>\nworking outside the house and Papa<br/>\nwere home I&#39;d expect him to do it, no big deal.  I do the<br/>\ncleaning because I want it done right.<br/>\n We both work, right now Papa works out of the house but as<br/>\nsoon as it is feasible he&#39;ll be <br/>\nworking right at home, beside me.  I do the majority of the<br/>\nteaching but that is only because <br/>\nI happen to be here.  (and I have a *lot more patience, all<br/>\nhail me :)   I don&#39;t know how much <br/>\nit helped her understand because she shot me one of those<br/>\n&quot;uh,huh&quot; looks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I thought we had taken care of the gender demon long<br/>\nago but I guess our womens studies<br/>\nand her-story classes are not quite enough.

You mean girls can be nurses?!&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a good story!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids ask what I&#39;ve done as jobs before.  I&#39;ve done administrative stuff, <br/>\nteaching, and earlier-years restaurant (waitress, counter) stuff.  Many of my <br/>\nfriends are childless, and the kids see all them go to work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a family of close friends who live nearby.  We&#39;ve known them since <br/>\nKirby and their oldest girl (now 15 and 16) were babies, and we met in La <br/>\nLeche League.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents assured us all they were going to raise their daughters with no <br/>\nsexist biases.  They did a good job of trying, and we were all cooperative as <br/>\ncould be.  We had two more children, another boy for us, another girl for <br/>\nthem.   We had another, a girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrustratingly for them, their oldest, Lily, was VERY pink.  While she would <br/>\nplay with boys&#39; toys, she did it in a wimpy, girly way.  Not from example, <br/>\nbut from personality.  Meanwhile, Kirby was playing with dolls and all AND <br/>\nboy toys, and they couldn&#39;t figure out what they were doing wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll they were doing wrong was disregarding what the children wanted and <br/>\npreferred and fantasized about.  (And we lucked out with Kirby, in their eyes <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the oldest was five I found, at a thrift store, a sequined swim suit.  <br/>\nNot for swimming, I think, but like for a kid beauty pageant, or dance show.  <br/>\nIt had an anchor with a ribbom around it, like an old sailor&#39;s tatoo, all <br/>\ndone in red, white and blue sequins, on a red and white swim suit.   I <br/>\nchecked with her mom first, but I gave it to her and she LOVED it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays Lily is not what anyone would consider girly.  She wears practical <br/>\nclothes, pursues &quot;neutral&quot; friends and activities, and her younger sister is <br/>\nsomewhat more feminine but neither is a squeally, make-up-wearing <br/>\nshopping-girl at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir parents are divorced, but live two blocks apart.  The dad works at the <br/>\nHarley Davidson shop (selling clothes and gifts) and the mom is living with a <br/>\nwoman; both of them work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s the most extreme example I have in my close life.  They tried hard <br/>\nand the child still went through a decidedly girlie phase.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we&#39;ve done pretty well with our kids.  I wasn&#39;t willing to go to work <br/>\njust to allow them to see their mom working, and my husband makes more money <br/>\nas an engineer than I could make doing officework or teaching, although he&#39;s <br/>\nwilling to trade out (and might do a better job with the housekeeping if we <br/>\ndid, although we wouldn&#39;t be able to afford the house!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jennifer Deets","from":"&quot;Jennifer Deets&quot; &lt;jdeets@...&gt;","profile":"abcdeets","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"K9I7-WfGpMiDdxN9haAiAxZFUJWQD8Y783H7zloZnqOyiXbzVKy245Na7OIVJPtRrUj-QT2Og9MRSZXAk0S9h2r-ELqhkb4MHjV6","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Gender Roles and Unschooling","postDate":"1003914274","msgId":26964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDkwMWMxNWM2YSRlNjk4MTVhMCQ4MjdiYThjMEBjZmwucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26967,"prevInTime":26963,"nextInTime":26965,"topicId":26964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My husband and I both work.

He is a nurse and I am a professor. On the days he is at the hospital, I&#39;m home and when I&#39;m at the university, he&#39;s home. Occasionally we need to hire a babysitter for a few hours if a special meeting is called or something, but in general each of us has three days a week with the kids and one whole day (at least in theory) as a family. Sometimes it gets to be overwhelming, but the longer we do this, the less willing we would be to trade the beautiful time we have with our three children.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of why we unschool is to not just disrupt but to shatter the strong gender role socialization that occurs in schools and neighborhoods and on TV. When our oldest was 4, she turned to me and said, &quot;Mommy, you&#39;re a teacher and daddy&#39;s a nurse, right?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then she looked at me straight in the eye and asked, &quot;When I grow up can I be a nurse?&quot; I told her that of course she could.
