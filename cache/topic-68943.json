I was at work so missed it. One of the boys on his team came to get his waterbottle from his mom. She would not give it to him because she said he was standing around, not running hard and not paying attention to the game. She told him he was going to be further punished at home and now he couldn&#39;t have a drink for the entire game. My son was horrified and could not believe the stupidity of the parent. He could not see how the mom thought that would make the boy play better or like it at all.I too was horrified that this can happen in front of others and be tolerated. Also my heart went out for the 11 year old boy. I gotta wonder what a parent who will do that in public is doing in private.YUCK!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTim and Maureen Thomas<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stillwaters.ca\">http://www.stillwaters.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68772,"nextTopicId":68921}}
