I&#39;m not sure why but up until I <br/>\nread that I thought you were a radical unschooler. I commend you for <br/>\nyour quest to do the right thing for your children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Sandra has a great idea about passing out litriture to <br/>\nothers and let them know that we could talk to them later after they <br/>\nhave read the information. What I like about it is that it quietly <br/>\nstates a qoute/comment someone staed not to long ago on this list.<br/>\n&quot;I appreciate your concern but your approval is not nessasary&quot;. <br/>\nTaking the action of what Sandra suggest is that you are confident <br/>\nin what you are doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got a kick out of the trac ideas. I laughed about passing them out <br/>\nand I think it&#39;s a great idea. I also like the idea about the comic <br/>\nbook or whatever else others would come up with. I think just having <br/>\nanything handy would be fun to have to get the well meaning family <br/>\nmembers off you back LOL.................<br/>\n<br/>\nSonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84172,"nextTopicId":84175}}
