We lived next door ot a guy who did them and from what I <br/>\nsaw of his artwork, he was great. We were both just discussing and tossing <br/>\naround ideas and places where to put them!<br/>\n<br/>\nI came home from work one day to have Joe show me his upper arm. He had this <br/>\nhuge wolf on it. I had never seen a tatto freshly done and the look of it <br/>\nwas unreal. I laughed and told him to go and wash it off. I thought it was <br/>\none of the ugliest things I had ever seen. When he told me it was real, I <br/>\nmust admit I cried. All of a sudden this gorgeous arm on my guy was ruined <br/>\nwith a wolf that looked like he was wiggin!! I was very upset and then of <br/>\ncourse, so was Joe. The next day I was on the phone inquiring about removal. <br/>\nVery costly to have removed what he had done.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast forward about 11 years later. Joe still has a tatto although he went <br/>\nand had it fixed. It&#39;s now a tiger and I have no problems with it anymore. I <br/>\nfreaked out over something I had no right to freak out about. It wasn&#39;t my <br/>\nbody and he didn&#39;t need my permission to go and have it done. It never <br/>\ncaused any problems of any kind and really, is no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nTara had her ears pierced the first time when she was about 7. I don&#39;t <br/>\nautomatically do that when the girls are born. They decide to have it or <br/>\nnot. Tara now has her ears pierced three times each. She asked ahead of time <br/>\nand I had no problem with it. I&#39;ve seen her through her dark period when all <br/>\nthe clothing was black and her makeup was also color coordinated!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wanted her belly button pierced at 13. I wasn&#39;t sure at the time what I <br/>\nthought so I said she had to get permission from her dad. (not my husband) <br/>\nSomething like that I do need to have his okay on or else if he wanted, we <br/>\ncould have trouble. Of course he said no and to be honest, I was off the <br/>\nhook. Well she brought it up again when she was 15. Obviously something she <br/>\nhadn&#39;t forgotten about. She had grown into and incredible young lady and <br/>\nwhen I really thought about it, what was the big deal??? So again, I told <br/>\nher she had to have her dad say okay, but I helped her work on him. &lt;BG&gt; In <br/>\nthe meantime, we went through where we would go, and exactly what would <br/>\nhappen in the process. She knew if it was a hassle, she could remove it. SHe <br/>\nstill wanted to get it done, I convinced her dad and off we went. Tara, me <br/>\nand Joe. SHe got her belly button pierced while I held her hand and Joe was <br/>\nin the other room getting the wolf made into a tiger!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe belly button looks adorable and now she wants a tattoo. SHe&#39;s been <br/>\ntalking about a small one for years also. I have no problem with that <br/>\neither, but it is definitely something her dad will not give permission for. <br/>\nSo she knows she&#39;ll have to wait until she&#39;s 18. She&#39;s got another year. If <br/>\nshe still wants to, Joe said he would take her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see when I don&#39;t limit her choices, she actually makes very good <br/>\ndecisions. Even if one if adverse to piercings and tattoos, I can&#39;t see <br/>\nwhere Tara&#39;s choices offend. She works with many young adults who have <br/>\ndifferent colored hair and face piercings and tattoos. It hasn&#39;t seemed to <br/>\nhinder them from working. Possibly they might not get a certain job they may <br/>\nwant later in life, but I somehow think it won&#39;t bother them much or they <br/>\nwill find a way around it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B (sorry for the length)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OT:  The Weather in D.C.","postDate":"1042844205","msgId":55464,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFMjg4QTJELkJCNkExMDExQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTE3MjAzNDU2LjI5MDQucW1haWxAd2ViNDAxMDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":55458,"nextInTopic":55480,"prevInTime":55463,"nextInTime":55465,"topicId":55401,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
