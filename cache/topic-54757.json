No matter how many times I see <br/>\nit, I cry at the end every time. I&#39;ts a must for all my kids to see at a <br/>\ncertain point in time! True story too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother favorite is My Cousin Vinny. Totally different kind of movie but a <br/>\nclassis in my eyes none the less. I actually watched this one while Joseph <br/>\nwas being born. Even the Dr. kept turning around to see what was going on!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
