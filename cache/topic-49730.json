This colorful fok has brought forth numerous excellent <br/>\ninstrumentalists, notably violinists.  They learn to play much as an infant <br/>\nlearns to walk-without teaching methods, lessons. or drills.  No written <br/>\nmusic is used.  The youngster is merely given a small fiddle and allowed to <br/>\njoin the gypsy band.  He gets no explanations or corrections.   He causes no <br/>\ndisturbance, for his timid efforts are scarcely audible.  He listens: he <br/>\ntries to play simultaneously what he hears, and gradually succeeds in finding <br/>\nthe right notes and producing a good tone.<br/>\nWithin a few years he has developed into a full fledged member of the band <br/>\nwith complette command of his instrument.  Are these gypsy children <br/>\nparticularly gifted? No, almost any child could accomplish what they do.  The <br/>\nband acts as teacher talking to the pupil in the direct language of music.  <br/>\nThe novice, by joining the band, is immediately placed in the most helpful <br/>\nmusical atmosphere and psychological situation: thus, from the beginning, he <br/>\nfinds the right approach to musical activity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe again:<br/>\nNo, we don&#39;t have  a tribe of people playing music in our home every day. But <br/>\nthe lesson here can be used.<br/>\nSurround children with music, surround them with musicians if that&#39;s what <br/>\nthey wish. Give them access to instruments, as many as possible, access to <br/>\nteachers they can come and go from as they choose.<br/>\nLet it be THEIR experience. Hold no hopes for what you want them to get out <br/>\nof it.<br/>\nIt must be theirs and if you allow it to be totally their own way, you will <br/>\nenable them to enjoy music and instruments for life. Not turn it into a chore <br/>\nthat will snuff that joy out forever.<br/>\nDon&#39;t decide for them that they need mastery of an instrument. Only they can <br/>\ndecide how far to push themselves.  Offer, encourage, join in, but do not <br/>\npush or force.<br/>\nPlease!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, a former music lover that got ruined by lessons and is now reclaiming <br/>\nthe joy of music.....<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

He listens: he <br/>\ntries to play simultaneously what he hears, and gradually succeeds in finding <br/>\nthe right notes and producing a good tone.<br/>\nWithin a few years he has developed into a full fledged member of the band <br/>\nwith complette command of his instrument.  Are these gypsy children <br/>\nparticularly gifted? No, almost any child could accomplish what they do.  The <br/>\nband acts as teacher talking to the pupil in the direct language of music.  <br/>\nThe novice, by joining the band, is immediately placed in the most helpful <br/>\nmusical atmosphere and psychological situation: thus, from the beginning, he <br/>\nfinds the right approach to musical activity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe again:<br/>\nNo, we don&#39;t have  a tribe of people playing music in our home every day. But <br/>\nthe lesson here can be used.<br/>\nSurround children with music, surround them with musicians if that&#39;s what <br/>\nthey wish. Give them access to instruments, as many as possible, access to <br/>\nteachers they can come and go from as they choose.<br/>\nLet it be THEIR experience. Hold no hopes for what you want them to get out <br/>\nof it.<br/>\nIt must be theirs and if you allow it to be totally their own way, you will <br/>\nenable them to enjoy music and instruments for life. Not turn it into a chore <br/>\nthat will snuff that joy out forever.<br/>\nDon&#39;t decide for them that they need mastery of an instrument. Only they can <br/>\ndecide how far to push themselves.  Offer, encourage, join in, but do not <br/>\npush or force.<br/>\nPlease!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, a former music lover that got ruined by lessons and is now reclaiming <br/>\nthe joy of music.....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46814,"nextTopicId":50028}}
