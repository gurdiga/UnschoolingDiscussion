And, when you <br/>\nsaid...nah, don&#39;t like that term...too much baggage from old <br/>\nlists/posting/etc. too closely tied to TCS and all those <br/>\nLiberatarian lunatics.

I started reading/thinking/experimenting with TCS, read for <br/>\nover a year thinking...this is really cool and interesting...but I <br/>\nhave no desire to actually try it...way too scary!  Then, suddenly I <br/>\ndid feel like I wanted to try it.  One of the reasons I felt less <br/>\noverwhelmed with the thought of trying it then, was that it was <br/>\nsummer....so I didn&#39;t have to figure out the school coercion part!  <br/>\nSo, it started with the biggies being sleep, food and media.  Then, <br/>\nI found unschooling.com and realized....oh, boy...I really want to <br/>\ntake plunge!  So, for a year now, I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how <br/>\nto do that and each and every day I read on the unschooling.com <br/>\nboards my resolve got stronger.  The problem for me was that I <br/>\nreally, really, really wanted to be the one at home with the kids.  <br/>\nAnd no matter how many ways I tried to turn things upsidedown and <br/>\nbackwards to see my way clear to do that, I was stuck.  My husband <br/>\nwas a high school teacher before he left that to stay home with our <br/>\nkids...and if he were to go back to that it would pay less than half <br/>\nof what I make.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  He&#39;s been doing some <br/>\nhandyman business now that the kids are all in school, but that <br/>\nisn&#39;t panning out to have the potential to support the family <br/>\neither.  Anyway, we have finally decided to go fot it anyway and are <br/>\ntaking the kids out of school, with my husband at home.  Obviously, <br/>\nI&#39;ll be part of it too...since we all know unschooling doesn&#39;t just <br/>\nhappen during school hours, but it is really hard for me to let go <br/>\nof the fantasy of being the one with them all day, every day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTCS opened my eyes to possibilies that intrigued me.  But, it is the <br/>\nunschooling.com crew that showed me that it could really work...with <br/>\nreal people, real kids, real families.
