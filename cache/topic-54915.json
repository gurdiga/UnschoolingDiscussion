If we are happy we tend to be<br/>\nrespectful and giving and loving. It&#39;s hard to be that way if we are<br/>\nsuffering and unhappy, because those emotions color our perception of<br/>\nthe world and our actions. Even criminals and such are suffering<br/>\npeople, not just happy and *bad*. It&#39;s the suffering that prompts them<br/>\nto act violently or with no regard to others whatsoever. <br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
