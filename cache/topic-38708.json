Heck, I&#39;m sure people have thought that <br/>\nabout my kids off and on, over the years, as they&#39;ve gone through various <br/>\nstages. I mean - most of us are figuring this out as we go along and I&#39;ve <br/>\nsometimes felt a step or two behind --figuring it out, finally, AFTER we&#39;ve <br/>\nsuffered through some weeks or months of not knowing how to respond to some <br/>\nsort of behavior issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd temperament matters. It is easy to &quot;blame&quot; parenting techniques when you <br/>\nsee an intense and apparently out-of-control kid - but maybe that kid is SO <br/>\nmuch calmer and happier than he/she&#39;d be without whatever the parent IS <br/>\ndoing. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38699,"nextTopicId":38731}}
