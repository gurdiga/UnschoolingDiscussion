I am Kristin, <br/>\nmom to Chloe (10) and Ryan (8), wife to Mark.  We currently live in <br/>\nHawaii, but are hoping to move to Massachusetts by this fall.  We <br/>\ncame here from California last summer.  I have unschooled there and <br/>\ngone to the HSC conference in Sacramento many times.  It&#39;s a great <br/>\nconference, but kids must stay with the parents at all times, so it <br/>\nwas a bit hard to take kids unless you had two adults.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, since we are considering a move to New England I have been <br/>\nvery interested in the discussion of a unschooler&#39;s conference <br/>\nthere.  I had always want to go the GWS conference, but didn&#39;t make <br/>\nit.  I do have the old conference brochure and it took place at <br/>\nEisner Camp in the Berkshires.  Sounds like a fabulous place.  I was <br/>\nwondering if it might be possible to get some conference tips from <br/>\nthe people at Holt Associates.  I&#39;m not sure how much of an <br/>\norganization is left, but I hear that Pat Farenga is still making the <br/>\nrounds so he may be able to help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I just found online is the Unschoolers Network <br/>\nConference in New Jersey on June 28th.  Linda Dobson will be the <br/>\nkeynote speaker.
