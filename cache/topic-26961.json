I&#39;m assuming, then, that it&#39;s an<br/>\ninternational flight, and those are really even safer...<br/>\n<br/>\nI travel alone with my 8 yr old, who is actually much easier to travel<br/>\nwith nowadays... she&#39;s been on lots of long plane trips, though, she&#39;s a<br/>\npretty seasoned flyer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also if something did happen I have <br/>\n&gt; an incredibly sensitive child who would never get on a plane again. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have an incredibly sensitive child, and it&#39;s been a real learning<br/>\nexperience for me. Five was a hard year for her, as was six... but one<br/>\nthing I realized was that my expectations often had a lot to do with her<br/>\nresponses. When I believed that after some shock she would never do X<br/>\nagain, it seemed to hold true, but when I could start to believe that<br/>\nafter some sort of trauma she would be quite upset and would need time<br/>\nand space and support, but that she was also a tough little cookie and<br/>\nwould get through it and do what needed to be done... that&#39;s what<br/>\nhappened.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday she got bit in the face by my parents&#39; previously traumatized<br/>\ndog, for no reason that we can figure - he&#39;s done this before, although<br/>\nnot for a long time, he fear-bites and we haven&#39;t figured out the<br/>\ntrigger. It was pretty scary, for a good 20 minutes she just sat there in<br/>\nshock with my arms around her, then finally she relaxed enough to lean<br/>\nback onto me, and it took over an hour before she really came around. But<br/>\ntwo hours after it happened, she called the dog over and patted his head<br/>\nand forgave him - she does love this dog, and he does love him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, most  people might think they should get rid of this dog, but<br/>\nit&#39;s not gonna happen...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also in <br/>\n&gt; my grocery store I doubt I will see another being subdued.
