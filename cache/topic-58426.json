(Could be anything that will hold the matches.) Light the <br/>\nmatches and put a glass over the lemon/matches.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe water all swooshes up into the glass.  If you have a good seal, you <br/>\ncan even lift the glass and the plate will lift with the water still in <br/>\nthe glass.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery cool.
