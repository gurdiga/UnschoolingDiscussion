It&#39;s<br/>\nby the British soldier-poet Wilfred Owen:<br/>\n<br/>\nWilfred Owen, Dulce et Decorum est (1917)<br/>\n<br/>\nBent double, like old beggars under sacks,<br/>\nKnock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,<br/>\nTill on the haunting flares we turned our backs,<br/>\nAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge.<br/>\nMen marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,<br/>\nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame, all blind;<br/>\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br/>\nOf gas-shells dropping softly behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nGas! Gas! Quick, boys! An ecstasy of fumbling,<br/>\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,<br/>\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling<br/>\nAnd floundering like a man in fire or lime.<br/>\nDim through the misty panes and thick green light,<br/>\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.<br/>\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight,<br/>\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf in some smothering dreams, you too could pace<br/>\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in.<br/>\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br/>\nHis hanging face, like a devil&#39;s sick of sin;<br/>\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br/>\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br/>\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br/>\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,<br/>\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br/>\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,<br/>\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est<br/>\nPro patria mori.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUncoventional Ideas:  A Collection of Short Essays Which Question Mainstream<br/>\nValues<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unconventionalideas.com\">http://www.unconventionalideas.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14107,"nextTopicId":14103}}
