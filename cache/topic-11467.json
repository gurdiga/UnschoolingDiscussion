I never minded \nbeing an only. My point was that people have a misconception that raising an \nonly is less demanding. I was trying to negate that. Beleive me, I understand \nthe pluses of being an only. No one to fight with, all the toys are yours, you \nhave control of the tv, if you want quiet time you just go home. On the other \nhand, raising an only can be very demanding. The child wants to play a game and \nno one&#39;s around you&#39;re it, the child gets bored in the car you have to entertain \nthem, etc. As Olivia said every family situation has positives and \nnegatives.</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Amy</font></div>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote\n style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#000000 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;PADDING-RIGHT:0px;\">\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\">----- Original Message ----- </div>\n  <div\n style=\"BACKGROUND:#e4e4e4;FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>From:</b> \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earthmagik@...\"\n title=\"earthmagik@...\">Michelle Harper</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>To:</b> <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\"\n title=\"Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> </div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Sent:</b> Saturday, July 22, 2000 10:06 \n  AM</div>\n  <div style=\"FONT:10pt arial;\"><b>Subject:</b> [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: \n  Only&#39;s</div>\n  <div><br></div>\n  <div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">I was an only, My husband was an only, and our \n  son, at this point , is an only.&nbsp; We have constant oppurtunities to be \n  around others.&nbsp; All day, everyday.&nbsp; I kind of value the time spent, \n  as an only.&nbsp; I think the first person in the world we should really get \n  to know is ourselves.&nbsp; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I long, at times , to be in \n  sibling company, my friend for instance has 5 kids..we love to spend time with \n  them..we are today, in fact.&nbsp; Extended family really.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think \n  it&#39;s so bad to be an only, perhaps their are experiences there, that others \n  don&#39;t have time for.&nbsp; We rarely , actually have just , quiet time \n  alone.&nbsp; Few people do, I think it a healthy, meditative practice, if we \n  had some time for it, which we have to &quot;make&quot; time for too.&nbsp; But being an \n  only is cool, too.&nbsp; My 50 cents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a \n  free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11465,"nextTopicId":11462}}
