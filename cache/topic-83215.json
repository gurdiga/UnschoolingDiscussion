Well.  He had never been in on the original conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not long after that they got a Nintendo system.<br/>\nAnd they loosened up on their lessons.<br/>\nAnd the mom eventually ran the dad off (to the other end of their rambling <br/>\nhippie property, but off from the main house).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had been living off his mental disability payments (and social security <br/>\nand welfare), but the kids came up with a very cool magic and juggling act, <br/>\nand some of you probably have seen them or will someday.   &quot;The Clan Tynker.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pennsic.net/entertain/clan_tynker.html\">http://www.pennsic.net/entertain/clan_tynker.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAt one time they had a webpage (an advertisement, not much more) but I didn&#39;t <br/>\nfind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls&#39; real names were Sarah and Mary (Biblical) but they messed with <br/>\nthem (which is fine).
