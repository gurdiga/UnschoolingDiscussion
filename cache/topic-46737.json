If you know one or <br/>\nboth of those it is easy to go into countries with similar languages and <br/>\n*kind of* understand what they are talking about. I think if you are going <br/>\ninto business it would be a good idea to know either Japanese or Chinese. It <br/>\nis my personal opinion that people should be at least bilingual. I also think <br/>\nthat when going to a country where you don&#39;t speak the language that you <br/>\nshould carry and USE one of those English to _____ dictionaries. I speak <br/>\nSpanish, it helps me in the area I live in. I know a tad of Farsi, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t hear it often, nor do I have the occasion to speak it so I am limited <br/>\nto basic words. (left over from when we used to live in Iran) I can <br/>\nfollow/stumble along in German and I converse nicely in Swedish. (Only <br/>\nbecause my Great grandma didn&#39;t speak anything else. &lt;g&gt;) I really think it <br/>\nis important to know how languages work. Sometimes even if I don&#39;t speak a <br/>\nlanguage I can get a good idea of what people are saying. Darin gets a kick <br/>\nout of going somewhere with me where people maybe speaking something other <br/>\nthan English. We went to an Italian restaurant in Chicago years ago and the <br/>\nowners spoke Italian. I don&#39;t speak Italian, but I could tell Darin what <br/>\n(most) was being said. I guess, I am just lucky.

No matter what large city you&#39;re in, especially, like you say, in the southern states, you have Spanish-speaking people. Personally, I can translate written Spanish, but I can barely understand a word of spoken Spanish. I never studied it, though. I find sign language come in very handy, also. If everyone learned at least the alphabet in sign language, then everyone could make themselves understood no matter where they are. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: Alan & Brenda Leonard <br/>\n  My take on this is that a fair number of Americans *do* study other<br/>\n  languages.  It&#39;s not about narrowmindedness or lack of interest in broading<br/>\n  our horizons.  The question is, what language should we study?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you live in a non-English speaking country, the answer is fairly<br/>\n  obviously English.  That&#39;s the result of the current economic and political<br/>\n  situation where English-speaking nations dominate.  If this were the time of<br/>\n  the Roman Empire, we&#39;d all be learning Latin.  At various times in history,<br/>\n  other languages have dominated.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I studied two foreign languages, French and German.  They received<br/>\n  absolutely no use whatsoever until the Army sent us to Germany 14 years<br/>\n  after I last studied a language.  But the chances were just as good we could<br/>\n  have gone to Korea or Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Perhaps we could be more tolerant of other people&#39;s cultures and<br/>\n  particularly of those folks with accents of any sort.  But yes, I do think<br/>\n  at least a minimal amount of English is necessary when living in America.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Did you have any suggestions on what language Americans should learn?<br/>\n  Spanish has uses, particularly in the southern U.S.  Vietnamese is fairly<br/>\n  big in the West.  More people speak Manderin Chinese than anything else, but<br/>\n  depending what you&#39;d like to do with your life, Arabic is needed much more.<br/>\n  Herein lies the problem.
