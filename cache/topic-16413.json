Since then he&#39;s also learned his colors, shapes (including polygon, <br/>\noctogan and others) and numbers.  I&#39;m not sure how this happens -- whether <br/>\nits shows like Sesame Street or all the reading we do..but somehow he&#39;s <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short reason why I&#39;m joining this list now even before he&#39;s preschool <br/>\nage:  my inlaws are putting lots of pressure on getting him on a waiting list <br/>\nfor the &quot;right&#39; kind of preschool.  We told them when he was born we were <br/>\ngoing to homeschool him (we hadn&#39;t learned about unschooling then -- and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think they need to know about that for a long time.)  But they seem to <br/>\nthink the whole reason for homeschool is because we can&#39;t afford private <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading the Unschooling Handbook and I love it.  It has revitalized <br/>\nwhat I used to do with Andrew before Eli was born.  I&#39;ve always given Andrew <br/>\ninfo about the world if he was interested...for example, when we go grocery <br/>\nshopping we talk about the different veggies...even when he was a baby I&#39;d <br/>\ntalk about them.  But when I had the baby I kind of got sidetracked into day <br/>\nto day things without really involving them in whatever we were doing.  So I <br/>\nthink the Unschooling Handbook is handy even from infancy.  Its helped remind <br/>\nme that my children don&#39;t start learning magically at age 5 and don&#39;t need to <br/>\nlearn certain things in a certain order.  We can find things we are <br/>\ninterested in and learn as much or as little about them as we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I&#39;m kind of unschooling myself...I was a kitchen/bath designer <br/>\nbefore kids and I&#39;ve wanted to do interior design with the kitchen/bath <br/>\ndesigning as a home based business.  I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of going back <br/>\nto school and getting an interior design degree. But as I will be certified <br/>\nin kitchen/bath design next year I decided to develop my own college level <br/>\nhome course.  I&#39;ve printed up the course description of what our local <br/>\ncollege requires for their 3 and 4 yr degrees in design and I&#39;m learning <br/>\nabout that subject.  For example, a 3 credit class is &quot;The History of <br/>\nFabric.&quot;  So I can go to the library; check out books on that subject and <br/>\nread to my heart&#39;s content.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you all think that sounds like a crazy idea????<br/>\n<br/>\nTanya<br/>\nmom to Andrew Jordan 4/1/00 and Eli Hunter 10/29/01<br/>\nYou cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within <br/>\nhimself <br/>\n--Galileo <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] my intro","postDate":"1028121599","msgId":39615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NkQ1QzNGLkFGODIlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2LjJiMzk3YzVlLjJhNzgyZjJmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39599,"nextInTopic":41760,"prevInTime":39614,"nextInTime":39616,"topicId":16413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s what John Holt called unschooling.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes and no. Michael has a quirk about him that doesn&#39;t translate well. I understand when someone says their kid needs structure, because Michael definately does better in a more structured environment. Unfortunately for him, his mom is highly disorganised :o)<br/>\nIt did seem that his giving me permission to remind him and help him keep on schedule was a pass to push him on all kinds of other things. From what time to get up to taking out the trash. Last year I even assigned him work in Language Arts. Acckkk!  Not one of the chosen subjects. ( only for about a month before I wisened up) And the guilt because I might have jumped in too soon to help and not let him continue to work out his schedule. But Michael might not have made that jump on his own.  <br/>\nKenna asked when we were going back to school last week. I replied &quot;When do you want?&quot; She chose to start back when the middle schooler&#39;s start back. See that&#39;s why I think we don&#39;t really qualify as unschoolers because I didn&#39;t suggest that we don&#39;t go back to school. They get to decide which books to use and if they don&#39;t like one we quit using it, but this year if they said &#39;NO&#39; would I let them go back to no schedule?  <br/>\nMichael and are headed to TVI (jr college) to sign up for a few computer classes on Tuesday. Will I be able to let him drop out if he doesn&#39;t like it? Hmmm, if he wants to drop out because he can&#39;t handle it because of his disability, then probably I would. But if he wants to drop out because it&#39;s too hard, or requires more time in homework that takes time away from playing on the computer, I&#39;m not sure. Inability or laziness.<br/>\nThis summer has been great. My relaxation level is higher than ever. Kenna made up her own written language, in code. She&#39;s done several music videos with her friends and coreagraphed (sp) most of the steps. Michael has spent hours watching the History channel and conversing with friends online. I shooed him off the computer at 6 am this morning.  <br/>\nMainly I&#39;m comfortable with where we are.  I fully believe in unschooling.  <br/>\nMost days I feel I&#39;m deschooling myself, unschooling Kenna and homeschooling Michael.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BkZWXCo_DefzwiqrCE25ZFkxvjuukeYbU4mHVXywagbdiP0KctdQRI0Jbj_q44wg-v1xtBT-pq3d-oisT-WWKPAjBs8WQmRV7Qw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] my intro","postDate":"997629438","msgId":23187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMDgxMjA4MTAzOS4wMGExZDg3MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PE9FMTAzWGNwakE1YVVPbnRNemswMDAyMWM4YkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23166,"nextInTopic":23194,"prevInTime":23186,"nextInTime":23188,"topicId":16413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What if I miss something? <br>What if he just watches tv all day, \nevery day?? And so I started with <br>the curriculum.......first this one, then \nthat one......and over the <br>past 2 years I&#39;ve gone through just about every \npopular curriculum <br>you&#39;ve heard of.......all to be abandoned because I \n&quot;realize the <br>error of my ways&quot; only to get panicky again and start all \nover.&nbsp; My <br>children have been quite forgiving and don&#39;t seem to notice \nmy <br>psychotic episodes much anymore except for the sudden influx of \n<br>worksheets and &quot;sit down&quot; time at the table.....
