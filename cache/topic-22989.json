We repeatedly ask them to stop,<br/>\n&gt;   move their sprinklers while they watch, turn them down, etc.  Now<br/>\n&gt;   that we are preparing to sell our home, we may have to repaint the<br/>\n&gt;   south side of our house from the water damage.

He first spoke to the<br/>\n&gt;   teenage daughter, as her mother was asleep, and she was flippant,<br/>\n&gt;   rude and unreasonable.  Then she went and woke her mother up.  When<br/>\n&gt;   we noticed her outside, my husand tried again to talk to them, saying<br/>\n&gt;   very nicely &quot;Hello...&quot;  which was all he got out of his mouth because<br/>\n&gt;   she proceeded to scream at him.  SO....he called the police.  We<br/>\n&gt;   thought maybe she would listen to an officer.  When he arrived he<br/>\n&gt;   commented that he heard them screaming something and running into the<br/>\n&gt;   house, no doubt because they were angry that we called the police.<br/>\n&gt;   But what else can we do, short of suing them?
