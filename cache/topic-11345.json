Also, goat&#39;s milk<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; often easier to digest than cow&#39;s.  If allergies are an issue in your<br/>\nfamily,<br/>\n&gt; you may get ahead even more by avoiding allergens in the goats feed.  Be<br/>\n&gt; careful what you feed the goat because the milk flavor changes (i.e. give<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; lots of peaches or peach peels and you&#39;ll get milk that tastes much<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\n&gt; than fed only on grain and hay!). (they do like the glue on the<br/>\n&gt; cans and can be a friendly lot, which leads to &#39;nibbling&#39; on people.  I<br/>\nnever<br/>\n&gt; received any more injury from a goat than getting my foot stepped on and<br/>\n&gt; bruised...once.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t bother keeping a billy goat on the same property with a nanny!  The<br/>\n&gt; billy goat hormones/phermones will cause the milk to smell and taste<br/>\n&gt; different...it can be quite nasty.  Besides you only need a billy around<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; breeding...for that you can transport the nanny for a visit to a local<br/>\n&gt; breeder or artificial inseminate.  Believe me, billy goats smell!  Nannies<br/>\n&gt; only are not at all bad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been out of town (and on no mail) for a few days...so if this little<br/>\n&gt; rant of mine has nothing at all to do with the current thread...my<br/>\napologies!<br/>\n&gt;  It&#39;ll either be the start of a new one or cheerfully (I hope!) ignored.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; FWIW,<br/>\n&gt; Eiraul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963995083/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/963995083/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11396,"nextTopicId":11412}}
