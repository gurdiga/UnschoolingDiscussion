I could certainly be wrong, but a lot of &quot;modern <br/>\nliterature&quot; seems thin and sloppy to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are probably more really great writings rejected every month these days <br/>\nthan were published in the 19th century altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back at the 20th century from this perspective (2003, ha!) I would <br/>\nenshrine Kahlil Gibran and Kurt Vonnegut.  Hermann Hesse, maybe.  Proves <br/>\nnothing except I&#39;m some kind of hippie.   But if I were teaching a literature <br/>\nclass, it would also be north America, Europe and the Middle East.   Ah.  I <br/>\nfeel virtue just oozing up around me.  Oh wait.  Let&#39;s call it English, <br/>\nGerman and Arabic.  That will make more parts of the world feel represented.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re all Christian, so that spoils my virtue some, but ethnocentricity is <br/>\njust one of those things we&#39;ll write off to &quot;that&#39;s the way the 20th century <br/>\nwas, before the current enlightenment.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65904,"nextTopicId":65878}}
