But they love to look at the toys when we go to Target and ask to go to Toys R Us just to look.  I use to love to go and look at toys in toy stores when I was young.  I don&#39;t think a parent is mean or &quot;controlling&quot; just because she won&#39;t buy her child a toy when asked.  I can&#39;t afford to buy many things for myself either.  It&#39;s just the reality of our financial situation.  Kids, just like adults, need to understand that they can&#39;t have or do everything.
