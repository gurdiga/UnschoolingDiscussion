It&#39;s as if the code is finally <br/>\nbroken and you&#39;re seeing the words on the page for what they really are.  <br/>\nMine came while I was reading a Family Circus comic strip.  Thelma (Mom) is <br/>\nstanding in the bathtub holding a part for the plumber, who is working on the <br/>\nfaucet.  Dolly comes in and says, &quot;That was [so and so] on the phone.  I told <br/>\nher you couldn&#39;t talk right now because you are in the bathtub with the <br/>\nplumber.&quot;  I sounded it out, then again, and suddenly I could just READ the <br/>\nwhole thing without sounding it out at all!   I just looked at all the words <br/>\non the page at once, and they stood on their own, as if they had come to <br/>\nlife.  I was 4 at the time, I think.  We were on vacation in Kansas City, at <br/>\na hotel with a pool on the roof, and my sister threw up in the hallway on the <br/>\nway back to our room after dinner that night.  She&#39;d had fish.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone else share their reading epiphany?  I&#39;m still waiting for that <br/>\nmoment in my younger son.  Last night I bought him a look-and-find book (like <br/>\nWhere&#39;s Waldo) without picture clues.  It only has written clues.  He <br/>\nLOOOOOOVES look-and-finds, so I think he just might do it.  I didn&#39;t make a <br/>\nproduction of it, just handed him the book and said &quot;Here, I thought you <br/>\nmight like this&quot;.  He opened it up and when he saw that the clues were <br/>\nwritten his forehead kinda wrinkled up and he took a quick, secret glance at <br/>\nme to see what I was going to do.  I pretended I didn&#39;t notice and kept <br/>\nunloading my shopping bags.  He didn&#39;t say a word.  He left the book on the <br/>\ntable, but when I got up this morning I found it peeking out from under his <br/>\npillow.  Hmmmm.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** KiM ***<br/>\nruns with scissors</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7831,"nextTopicId":7861}}
