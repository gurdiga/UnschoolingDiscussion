My youngest is now 10 1/2.  The <br/>\noldest is almost 15.  Both kids have mood disorders as do I.  They grew up <br/>\nin a household that was initially full of anxiety and anger so this may not <br/>\nhave any match with yours.  Insecurity has a lot to do with my daughter&#39;s <br/>\nobsession with the subject of my dying.  Medication for her and I both made <br/>\nit better, but whenever she would ask if I was going to die soon, I would <br/>\nask her what she was afraid was going to happen if I did.  The we would go <br/>\nthrough the scenario about that Daddy would still be here and her <br/>\ngrandparents and so on.  Or I would say, &quot;Look at your grandmother, she&#39;s <br/>\n96 and so I&#39;ll still be here when you have kids!&quot;  Or just keep talking <br/>\nuntil I would find out what event happened that day that caused her to <br/>\nthink about me and death, not always related.  Distraction wasn&#39;t always <br/>\nwhat she wanted, but she did want to talk about it somehow and be reassured <br/>\nthat she was loved and would be taken cared of and not abandoned (until she <br/>\nwas ready).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the topic will not go away, nor will the emotions.  So you listen, you <br/>\ncuddle, you reassure, and you empathize that yes, you will miss each other <br/>\nwhen that day ever comes, but that to worry about something sooooo far <br/>\nahead from today will just make you more sad than you want to be, and you <br/>\nwant to be happy hugging each other for now, and how we go and do.......OK?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina in Seattle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;like I might disappear any second &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if he was worried about me <br/>\n&gt;getting old and he burst into tears. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;that it is weighing on <br/>\n&gt;his little heart.

I showed my husband and made a comment about getting old. Jess (9) said &quot;don&#39;t grow old Mum&quot; and Mia (4) said &quot;you need a walking stick Mummy&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nTonight I went into the bathroom to help my other son Jacob (6) out of the shower and found him sobbing. I thought he was hurt at first but he said he wasn&#39;t. I got him out and wrapped him up and just cuddled him till he calmed down. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t want to talk about it but  I reminded him how much better he always felt when were able to talk. I asked him if he were worried about something  and he said yes, it&#39;s something I know is going to happen. <br/>\n<br/>\n I realized straight away what it was-he was looking at me like I might disappear any second and I asked if he was worried about me getting old and he burst into tears. We had another long hug and I told him that 32 wasn&#39;t all that old really and that I was pretty healthy and barring accidents I should live  for a long time to come. We talked about the stuff in life that is out of our control and we can&#39;t spend our whole life worrying about it. I said I wouldn&#39;t talk about me getting old if it was going to upset him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me feel really loved but I feel  bad that it is weighing on his little heart.
