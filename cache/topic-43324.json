The debate over who <br/>\nThomas Crapper was  or even if there was a Thomas Crapper at all<br/>\n <br/>\ncontinues. Below are some of the facts flushed out by Dr. Andy <br/>\nGibbons, historian of the International Thomas Crapper Society, and <br/>\nKen Grabowski, a researcher and author who is writing a book on <br/>\nCrapper&#39;s life. <br/>\n<br/>\nMyth: Thomas Crapper as a person never existed. <br/>\n<br/>\nFact: Though we do not know his actual date of birth, we can say a <br/>\nman, Thomas Crapper, was probably born in September, 1836, since he <br/>\nwas baptized the 28th of that month. He died on January 27, 1910. <br/>\n<br/>\nMyth: Thomas Crapper invented the toilet. <br/>\n<br/>\nFact: Although from 1861 to 1904 Crapper did have a successful career <br/>\nin the plumbing industry, holding nine patents for plumbing-related <br/>\nproducts in England, he did not invent the toilet. Albert Giblin <br/>\nholds the 1819 British Patent for the Silent Valveless Water Waste <br/>\nPreventer, a system that allowed a toilet to flush effectively. <br/>\nGiblin worked for Crapper as an employee and the most likely scenario <br/>\nis that Crapper bought the patent rights from Giblin and marketed the <br/>\ndevice himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nMyth: The word crap is derived from Thomas Crapper&#39;s name. <br/>\n<br/>\nFact: World War 1 doughboys passing through England saw the words T. <br/>\nCrapper Chelsea printed on the water tanks and coined the slang <br/>\ncrapper meaning toilet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":88778760,"authorName":"debi watson","from":"debi watson &lt;debiwatson@...&gt;","profile":"sheplusthree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: taboo words, was bedtimes","postDate":"1031515850","msgId":43342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWMyNTc3MyRkNDMwODNjMCQyN2E2NTYxOEBlZC5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGFsZ2Fybityam1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43340,"nextInTopic":43360,"prevInTime":43341,"nextInTime":43343,"topicId":43324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Crap is considered just as foul, if not more so, in South Africa.
