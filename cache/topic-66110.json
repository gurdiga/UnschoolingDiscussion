As <br/>\nI mentioned before, I also think it fits in perfectly with Unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of the book is to figure out what you want and get it, even if, as <br/>\nshe says, you have no money, no character, and are often grouchy.  She talks <br/>\nabout what your life would have been like if your parents had joyfully <br/>\nsupported your dreams, emotionally and with real help and resources.
