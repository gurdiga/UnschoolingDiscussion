I seem to remember him <br/>\n&gt; &gt;talking about kids staying home alone at very young ages.

My mum was a single <br/>\n&gt; parent of three. We often would get in from school around 4pm, eat the <br/>\n&gt; sadwhiches she&#39;d left for us and then go out and play until she got home <br/>\n&gt; from work about 6 or 7. That wasn&#39;t neglect. That was normal. While none <br/>\n&gt; of the neighbours were particuarly keeping an eye on us we knew we could <br/>\n&gt; knock on most of the doors if there was a problem and we&#39;d been taught <br/>\n&gt; to use the phone box across the street to dial 999 if it was serious.<br/>\n&gt; I recall times when she worked in the school,holidays so we would be <br/>\n&gt; alone all day. She gave us a list of chores, shopping to fetch and left <br/>\n&gt; us food. My only gripe was that, as the ledest , I was meant to be <br/>\n&gt; responsible for my brother sister. So I&#39;d get into trouble :-(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That wqas kind of our life growing up. My mom always worked, and we&#39;d come <br/>\nhome from school and watch tv, or play, or whatever. We played outside with <br/>\nfriends, and we were allowed to have friends my parents knew play at my house (if <br/>\nthey were allowed)  None of our friends&#39; moms worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe liked it a lot. My sister and I fought a lot, but I&#39;m not sure we wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave had my mom been home.
