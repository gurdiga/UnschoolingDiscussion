I&#39;ve been reading this list for a couple months, this is the topic<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s begged my reply, so I need to introduce myself, my name is Larla.<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; a grown unschooler from NJ, age twenty, who&#39;s learned to use the world as<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; teacher including books, textbooks, kind folks, art supplies, and even<br/>\n&gt; schools. I&#39;m finishing my last year at Sarah Lawrence College in New York,<br/>\n&gt; studying theater (multimedia activist performance art) and educational<br/>\n&gt; reform, cause I&#39;ve got a lot of empathy for kids that have unfree schools<br/>\n&gt; and don&#39;t yet have the options to leave school...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going into education for a little while as a theater teacher to<br/>\n&gt; facilitate free expression in schools and help deconstruct emotional,<br/>\n&gt; academic and physical walls that keep kids in school... am writing a book<br/>\n&gt; called Homeschooling, The Arts, and Educational Reform, which is why I<br/>\n&gt; subscribed to this list. If anybody has any suggestions of books to read<br/>\n&gt; that will help me articulate ideas of unschooling, my goal is to share the<br/>\n&gt; things that I&#39;ve learned from unschooling and arts with teachers, artists,<br/>\n&gt; parents and kids, to help inspire change toward holistic free learning in<br/>\n&gt; and out of schools.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; okay, and the reason that i am writing now is cause i agree with sandra,<br/>\n&gt; that forcing anyone to use any particular book is not unschooling.<br/>\nhowever,<br/>\n&gt; books are neutral tools in the world like any other tool. if made to use a<br/>\n&gt; book the kid may well resent the book. if a kid chooses to use a book and<br/>\n&gt; truly wants to learn what&#39;s inside it, that is a valid unschooling choice<br/>\n&gt; and positive use of a tool whether it is a math textbook or calvin and<br/>\n&gt; hobbes comic book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; math is indeed a language that is used to decribe the world, and most of<br/>\nus<br/>\n&gt; have learned languages with the help of books. it is dangerous to learn<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; from books, yet i think it is dangerous also to say flat out that what<br/>\n&gt; another is doing is not unschooling. i chose to use lots of books as an<br/>\n&gt; unschooler, chose to abandon them when they were boring. if your kids are<br/>\n&gt; learning everything they want to without books, that&#39;s all good, and if<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; one day say, mama i want to read this book now! then that&#39;s all good too<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m fairly confident that your unschooling path is wide enough to<br/>\naccomodate<br/>\n&gt; and make connections between that book and everything else in the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to the mama bear who&#39;s wondering about the math books she&#39;s using, maybe<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; kid needs a break from math books. or from being told to use them. in the<br/>\n&gt; meantime find the math in everyday life, cooking and sewing and buying<br/>\n&gt; groceries and drawing patterns, and if a math book becomes an interest to<br/>\n&gt; little bear, maybe check out saxon math texts, i used them as a kid, liked<br/>\n&gt; them cause they had lessons i could teach myself from and included lots of<br/>\n&gt; examples from real life including science language and experiments, i was<br/>\n&gt; into science...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; keep in mind tho that i liked them only after a long break from math, and<br/>\n&gt; only when i had picked them out, chose how much to do from them at any<br/>\ngiven<br/>\n&gt; time, checked my own work with full access to the teacher&#39;s manual and<br/>\n&gt; answer guide, fixed my own mistakes with a little input from my papa, and<br/>\n&gt; was free to skip problems in their often lengthy problem sets, and of<br/>\n&gt; course, was free to bring the book to the park or coffee shop and to do<br/>\n&gt; countless hours of doing &#39;nothing&#39;, painting, biking, running around,<br/>\n&gt; climbing trees, and reading other interesting books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hmmm a lengthy intro, many thanks to the thoughts that reach me every day<br/>\n&gt; from this very conscious group of people.<br/>\n&gt; peace and love,<br/>\n&gt; larla dey maloney :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Beyond that we are just exploring, living, being....<br/>\nI think that is why when someone starts asking me alot of questions about<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling...or how I do it, I am usually stymied.

If anybody has any suggestions of books to read<br/>\n&gt; that will help me articulate ideas of unschooling, my goal is to share the<br/>\n&gt; things that I&#39;ve learned from unschooling and arts with teachers, artists,<br/>\n&gt; parents and kids, to help inspire change toward holistic free learning in<br/>\n&gt; and out of schools.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; okay, and the reason that i am writing now is cause i agree with sandra,<br/>\n&gt; that forcing anyone to use any particular book is not unschooling. however,<br/>\n&gt; books are neutral tools in the world like any other tool. if made to use a<br/>\n&gt; book the kid may well resent the book. if a kid chooses to use a book and<br/>\n&gt; truly wants to learn what&#39;s inside it, that is a valid unschooling choice<br/>\n&gt; and positive use of a tool whether it is a math textbook or calvin and<br/>\n&gt; hobbes comic book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; math is indeed a language that is used to decribe the world, and most of us<br/>\n&gt; have learned languages with the help of books. it is dangerous to learn only<br/>\n&gt; from books, yet i think it is dangerous also to say flat out that what<br/>\n&gt; another is doing is not unschooling. i chose to use lots of books as an<br/>\n&gt; unschooler, chose to abandon them when they were boring. if your kids are<br/>\n&gt; learning everything they want to without books, that&#39;s all good, and if they<br/>\n&gt; one day say, mama i want to read this book now! then that&#39;s all good too and<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m fairly confident that your unschooling path is wide enough to accomodate<br/>\n&gt; and make connections between that book and everything else in the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to the mama bear who&#39;s wondering about the math books she&#39;s using, maybe the<br/>\n&gt; kid needs a break from math books. or from being told to use them. in the<br/>\n&gt; meantime find the math in everyday life, cooking and sewing and buying<br/>\n&gt; groceries and drawing patterns, and if a math book becomes an interest to<br/>\n&gt; little bear, maybe check out saxon math texts, i used them as a kid, liked<br/>\n&gt; them cause they had lessons i could teach myself from and included lots of<br/>\n&gt; examples from real life including science language and experiments, i was<br/>\n&gt; into science...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; keep in mind tho that i liked them only after a long break from math, and<br/>\n&gt; only when i had picked them out, chose how much to do from them at any given<br/>\n&gt; time, checked my own work with full access to the teacher&#39;s manual and<br/>\n&gt; answer guide, fixed my own mistakes with a little input from my papa, and<br/>\n&gt; was free to skip problems in their often lengthy problem sets, and of<br/>\n&gt; course, was free to bring the book to the park or coffee shop and to do<br/>\n&gt; countless hours of doing &#39;nothing&#39;, painting, biking, running around,<br/>\n&gt; climbing trees, and reading other interesting books.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hmmm a lengthy intro, many thanks to the thoughts that reach me every day<br/>\n&gt; from this very conscious group of people.<br/>\n&gt; peace and love,<br/>\n&gt; larla dey maloney :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

What I&#39;m curious<br/>\nabout is, in what way do you think it is dangerous to say what someone is<br/>\ndoing is not unschooling?  The word unschooling has to mean SOMETHING, just<br/>\nlike any other word, and I feel very confident in saying that making someone<br/>\ndo math is not unschooling.  Of course, if my kids want to use a textbook<br/>\n(or any other resource), pick it up themselves, and use it how and when they<br/>\nchoose to that can be part of their unschooling experience.  But if I tell<br/>\nmy kids, &quot;it&#39;s math time, here&#39;s your book&quot;, or if I make sure we play<br/>\nYahtzee once a week to sneak some math in they are not directing their own<br/>\nlearning; they are NOT unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I&#39;m curious about (but this part isn&#39;t directed at Larla), is<br/>\nwhy people are so anxious to be called unschoolers.  If a parent doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to send their kids to school, but believes they need to be taught<br/>\ncertain subjects, we have a word for that -  homeschooler.  For me it&#39;s a<br/>\ntotally different set of beliefs.    -Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Larla Dey [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:larladey@...\">larladey@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 08, 2001 4:39 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschoolers choosing to use books<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;.  She has a 10 year<br/>\n&lt;&lt;old who hates math and is using a textbook.   Do you have any<br/>\n&lt;&lt;suggestions for user friendly math books.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;If she uses a textbook or makes her kids use even user-friendly &lt;&lt;&lt;math<br/>\nbooks,<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;she&#39;s not unschooling and to pretend or believe otherwise will be a<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;big rock<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;in the road for her getting to real unschooling and (MAYBE) &lt;&lt;&lt;arranging<br/>\nlife so<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;that her 10 year old doesn&#39;t hate math from now on.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\nHi!
