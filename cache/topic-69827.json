But watching how people treat children <br/>\nhas made me not associate with some people as much. A year or so ago I was <br/>\nfeeling quite alone.  Like I was the only one that could see children as <br/>\npeople with feelings and ideas all their own.  I felt that, other than <br/>\nJackson, I had no one that I could talk to about my boys. The people around <br/>\nhere seem very much the &quot;children should be seen and not heard&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t speak <br/>\nunless you are spoken to&quot; kind.  That was what was so helpful about the <br/>\nconference last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that I was not alone.  Of course that led to this and a couple of <br/>\nother E groups.  From the groups I have met a couple of other unschoolers.  <br/>\nAlthough in this area they are a rare breed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway enough rambling,<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: peace and dramatic cluelessness  - Parking","postDate":"1053318579","msgId":69859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNTE4LjIyMjk0MC42MjQuMzAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69854,"nextInTopic":69936,"prevInTime":69858,"nextInTime":69860,"topicId":69827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I can parallel park too.
