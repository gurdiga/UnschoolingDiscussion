He also <br/>\nhad problems during the day with his feet.  Then when my son jumped <br/>\ninto one of those ball pits he hurt his ankle and could not walk.  <br/>\nOur homeopath suggested we take him to a chiropractor.  They did an <br/>\nadjustment on him and it was amazing.  He felt better right away.  <br/>\nThen the next week when he was jumping around as he loves to do he <br/>\nlater said he felt fuzzy in his leg.  We went the following day and <br/>\nwhen Sam got on the table she could even see which leg was out of <br/>\nalignment.  My son has such better health do to his visits to a <br/>\nchiropractor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there are different methods we use the Activator method.<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************************<br/>\nHere is something from a Chiropractor in Texas <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.babycottagehealth.com/\">http://www.babycottagehealth.com/</a><br/>\nGo to the heading<br/>\nKids and Chiropractic<br/>\nAs a concerned parent, you want the best for your child and no doubt <br/>\nwonder if your child is as healthy as he or she could be. Several <br/>\nfactors determine your child  &#39;²s overall health. These include:<br/>\ndiet, <br/>\nexercise, proper rest, emotional and spiritual support, and a <br/>\nproperly functioning nerve system.<br/>\n<br/>\nA major component for health is the communication between your <br/>\nchild  &#39;²s brain and body. This vital link controls the growth,<br/>\nrepair, <br/>\n& function of every tissue and organ. The spinal cord sends messages <br/>\nfrom the brain throughout the body via billions of nerves. <br/>\nInterference (nerve pressure or irritation) places the body in a <br/>\nstate of disharmony. This can lead to decreased immune function and <br/>\nsickness.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting with the birthing process itself, our bodies are subjected <br/>\nto many spinal traumas. Even the most natural of births can cause <br/>\nstress and strain to the tiny developing spine. This initial damage <br/>\ncan be compounded when the child is developing proper head support <br/>\nand learning to sit up, crawl, stand and walk. During this time of <br/>\nrapid spinal growth, these bumps and falls can be the cause of many <br/>\nunexplained health problems.........................(go to the site <br/>\nto read more)<br/>\n*******************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some links<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.activator.com/index.html\">http://www.activator.com/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLook up a chiropractor:<br/>\n Click here: Yahoo!
