Paint (dry, tempura, finger,<br/>\nfabric, do-a-dot), clay, glue, paint stamp things, things to glue (yarn,<br/>\nbuttons, etc.).  Basically anything that would ruin the carpet is out here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving two areas for the art has been great for us.  It is helpful in our<br/>\nfamily to have enough space so that the kids can play together or spread out<br/>\nwhen they feel the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8023463,"authorName":"Beth Jesch","from":"&quot;Beth Jesch&quot; &lt;bjesch@...&gt;","profile":"bjesch2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Storing Art Supplies","postDate":"1094954134","msgId":99528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNDM0QTI2LjI1Mzg0LkFDRUQ0QzlAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwOTQ5NTA5MjYuMTc2OS4yOTg2Ni5tOEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":99521,"nextInTopic":99564,"prevInTime":99527,"nextInTime":99529,"topicId":99521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We use a hardware storage box for the little things like, beads, foam cutouts, paperclips, rocks, stickers, bells, wire, plastic lacing, googly eyes....
