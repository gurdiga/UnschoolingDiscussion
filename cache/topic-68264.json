You may not feel like &quot;the perfect <br/>\nunschooler,&quot;  but I suspect that even when you&#39;re not, you pretty much know <br/>\nthe direction you need to go in. There is a reason that people come to hear <br/>\nyou speak at conferences, and it&#39;s not JUST cuz yer cute.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy even the standards of mainstream society, you have a reputation (some <br/>\nmight even say notoriety!) in your field.  You&#39;re an expert -- you know <br/>\nstuff! If you decided to write a book about it, your expertise and reputation <br/>\nwould get you a book contract. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68069,"nextTopicId":68236}}
