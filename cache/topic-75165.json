Leann<br/>\nDear Leann,<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family spent 3 1/2 years in the schools trying to help our son read. (He <br/>\nread better before he began)<br/>\nTo make a long story short and what brought us to Unschooling was letting him <br/>\ngo.<br/>\nWhat I mean is I let him read, view look at whatever he wanted. Magazines, <br/>\nClosed Captioning (while baby slept in my room and we sat together), Video <br/>\ngames, comic books anything he wanted. Eventually he requested the larger books, <br/>\nnovels to be precise. Our son went from mags to adultish chapter books. Once he <br/>\nfound he liked to follow the stories he jumped in and hasn&#39;t stopped. <br/>\nUnlike yours our son disliked reading. He would not pick one up let alone <br/>\neven let me buy one just to have around. Now he asks to go to the book store. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I have said it before but because of my joy I&#39;ll repeat myself. Our <br/>\nson was labeled LD in school and told us he will always struggle. They had no <br/>\nfaith in him and one private school even told us he was lazy (never looked at <br/>\nhis records nor spoke with me before making that statement though I had written <br/>\ntwo notes to her telling her as an FYI that he had some struggles. I met with <br/>\nher, told her and she said it again so I pulled him out. Funny thing is they <br/>\nare still demanding the rest of that school years tuition and have sent me to <br/>\ncollections. I am not paying it and as a matter of fact I told the collector <br/>\nthat called the other day that I just might sue them for damages. lol,after I <br/>\ntold the collector the story she told me to send in all his HS stuff, the letter <br/>\nfrom the teacher calling him lazy and they would close the account and tell <br/>\nthe school they would not collect on such a situation. HUH!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, SO what I am saying is have fun enjoy your children and let them read <br/>\nwhat they want. Also if the older one reads the younger one just might she <br/>\nthat and follow I know my daughter 3 1/2 is taking interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Mother of two, have questions regarding reading","postDate":"1056339712","msgId":75181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMS5jNjdkNzQ3LjJjMjdkMTAwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75180,"nextInTopic":75182,"prevInTime":75180,"nextInTime":75182,"topicId":75165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/22/2003 9:18:02 PM Mountain Daylight Time, ...

It&#39;s a pretty good book to teach reading.  She was <br/>\ntotally into it.  For the first few days she worked 10-15 pages a day. <br/>\n One night she announced she was staying up and studying ALL NIGHT.  She <br/>\ntold me I could sleep on the couch because she was lying in my spot on <br/>\nthe bed so she could work better with the light.  She picked the book <br/>\n(with my guidance) and worked through it (with my help) but she asked <br/>\nfor the book.  We read aloud to her a great deal, she writes constantly, <br/>\nour home is FILLED with books, (one job that has to be done regularly is <br/>\nto empty the bathrooms of reading material, and reshelve the books that <br/>\nare left by various locations including the beds and chairs and kitchen <br/>\ntable.)  Reading is everywhere, so I know Janene will learn to read. <br/>\n But she has ASKED to learn to read now so I am helping her.  I have <br/>\ntold her what things we can do (the explode the code book, flash cards, <br/>\nbob books, etc.) and she picked the explode the code, bob books, and <br/>\nreading games.  We have always played rhyming and word games, and she <br/>\nbegan writing by herself a long time ago.  Life creates so many writing <br/>\nopportunities, she writes down my order when she&#39;s playing waitress, <br/>\nwrites menus, writes notes to me or to her friends, she is writing all <br/>\nthe time and through writing she is learning to read.  Through reading <br/>\nshe is learning to write.  I know that if I wanted to I could do nothing <br/>\nand she&#39;d learn to read, because reading and writing are part of our <br/>\nlife, our culture and it would simply happen.  But I also know that <br/>\nJanene wants to learn now, has asked to learn, and so I am helping her. <br/>\n If she had asked to learn how to make cookies, Iwould provide the <br/>\nmaterials and the help and we would make cookies.  Same with reading.  I <br/>\nprovide the materials and help her and we learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI should note, she works in the book as she chooses.  I don&#39;t make her <br/>\ndo five pages a day, or ask her.  It&#39;s there, on the table.  She&#39;s been <br/>\nbusy the last few days with the new HP book and her birthday party.  So <br/>\nshe hasn&#39;t done anything in it.  It&#39;ll happen.  Just like everything <br/>\nelse, she will start college reading, she will be weaned, will no longer <br/>\nbe sleeping in the bed with me, she will not wet her college dorm bed, <br/>\nand she will have learned how to fold her own laundry and scrub a <br/>\ntoilet.   Well, no guarantees on the last two things.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nLeAnn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi everyone, I am a young mother of two boys, aged four and one.

I have two kids age 8 and 10.  The 10 yo <br/>\nloved books almost from the moment of her birth.  I thought she would <br/>\nread really early, like 4 or 5.  As it turned out, she could read a <br/>\nfew selected words at those ages like our names and the word love <br/>\n(always a favorite!).  However, she didn&#39;t read a book until age 7.5 <br/>\n(with no reading lessons, just answering her questions when she had <br/>\nthem).  She is a Harry Potter fan and is in the middle of the new <br/>\nbook now.  This is first one that she is reading on her own.  In the <br/>\npast I read them all to her, but she was so anxious to get going on <br/>\nit she couldn&#39;t wait for me this time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ok to just read aloud and encourage a love of books without <br/>\nthinking they need to learn to read right away.  Right now, my son <br/>\nwho will be 9 in 3 months is not a reader, but he absolutely loves <br/>\nbooks.  He was the complete opposite of his sister, he couldn&#39;t even <br/>\nsit for a read aloud until he was 5.5.  I despaired for years that he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t love books, and then boom, he did.  Now, he loves to be read <br/>\nto, loves to sit and look at picture books on his own.  I&#39;m sure that <br/>\nhe won&#39;t be able to read books for a long time, but that&#39;s ok.  He <br/>\ndoes recognize his name.  In fact, he went out the mailbox yesterday <br/>\nand came back with the mail saying he got two letters!  I was very <br/>\nsurprised, but he did read his name on the letters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, let your son come to reading on his own.

I&#39;m sure you <br/>\nall can identify with my excitement over his eagerness, I just don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to mess it up.  I don&#39;t want to do nothing if that is <br/>\nthe &quot;wrong&quot; thing to do, and make him have a hard time with reading <br/>\nin the future.  But on the other hand I don&#39;t want to push and poke <br/>\nat him to make him do something he could do on his own.  Any <br/>\nsuggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!<br/>\nLeAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75394,"nextTopicId":75400}}
