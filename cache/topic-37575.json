But we have the most wonderful conversations<br/>\nand find new directions to explore when we take the time to do this.<br/>\nYesterday a friend brought over the DVD of a movie about the crusades which<br/>\nwe watched together and even though ds didn&#39;t stay for the whole flick, we<br/>\nknew he&#39;d want to come back for the special features on castles and medieval<br/>\nweapons.

That&#39;s too much waiting. I mean, just take the example of games  <br/>\n- there are LOTS of times that kids can&#39;t imagine how much fun a game  <br/>\nis going to be, just from looking at the box, for example. If YOU  <br/>\nknow that she LOVED Candyland, then you might pick up Chutes and  <br/>\nLadders because it is also likely to be fun for her - you don&#39;t need  <br/>\nto wait for her to ask for it. She might never happen to see it and  <br/>\nmight very likely never realize that it is a game she&#39;d like a lot.  <br/>\nOr maybe she loves CLUE - she&#39;d likely enjoy MASTERMIND - both  <br/>\ninvolve the same kind of logical thinking. So - how is she going to  <br/>\nknow that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard of unschoolers who say they never bring home anything for  <br/>\ntheir kids - because they feel that puts subtle pressure on them to  <br/>\nlearn what the parents are promoting. I say hogwash to that &lt;G&gt;. I  <br/>\npick up stuff ALL the time - STILL do it and mine are 14, 18, and  <br/>\nalmost 21. If I see an unusual fruit in the grocery store, I buy it  <br/>\nand take it home and put it on the table for others to notice. If a  <br/>\nkid is in the store with me I might say, &quot;Oooh look at this. Let&#39;s  <br/>\ntake it home and cut it open.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why some of us dislike the term &quot;child-led&quot; or &quot;child- <br/>\ndirected&quot; learning --- unschooling is not child-led or child-directed  <br/>\nlearning - that makes it sound like the parent should just be a  <br/>\n&quot;follower.&quot; Not so - parents are active participants and part of the  <br/>\njob of an unschooling parent is to keep the child in mind and to fill  <br/>\nhis/her life with just the right amount of interesting new  <br/>\nexperience, chances to repeat experiences, down time, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way to make it &quot;just right&quot; is to offer and not coerce. If  <br/>\nyou don&#39;t &quot;offer&quot; stuff/ideas/experiences, then the kids aren&#39;t going  <br/>\nto even know what&#39;s out there. If you push too much on them, they can  <br/>\nfeel pressured and that their learning is being taken over by you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t all that tricky, though, when you live with a kid and pay  <br/>\nattention and care deeply - to keep that child in mind and provide  <br/>\nhim/her with a pretty steady stream of options/possibilities/ideas/ <br/>\nstuff, etc. Invite and offer a lot - it is your job to create a  <br/>\nstimulating and interesting environment around her.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105602864,"authorName":"Wendy S.","from":"&quot;Wendy S.&quot; &lt;winksst@...&gt;","profile":"winksst","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Strewing","postDate":"1131259925","msgId":109358,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDREQjBDRDI5LTZGNTktNDE0Ri1BODI3LTNERDU3NTdERUUwRkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":102321,"nextInTopic":109359,"prevInTime":109357,"nextInTime":109359,"topicId":37575,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all.

If I had spent any extra time<br/>\nthinking about what to put in front of them and procuring it and<br/>\nleaving it about for them, they would not have had any free time.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not the strewing queen, and I may not even being doing the strewing<br/>\nthing &quot;right&quot;, but I&#39;ll add my two cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nPurposeful strewing is not something that I do or think about<br/>\nconstantly.  It really only comes up when we have a lull, or when my son<br/>\nsleeps in a long time in the morning and I get bored.  (Not enough email<br/>\nthat day?)  Then, in the process of tidying up, I might find a book or a<br/>\ntoy that has never been used or not been used recently and I&#39;ll put it<br/>\nin a prominent place.  The tiniest example I can think of is once I had<br/>\nmoved the K&#39;nex into a dresser drawer instead of a transparent storage<br/>\nbox.  I &quot;strewed&quot; them, when they hadn&#39;t been touched for awhile, by<br/>\njust pulling the drawer open so he could see them and be reminded of<br/>\nthem.  Our board games are overflowing the storage that we have in the<br/>\nliving room, so every so often, when I&#39;m pondering whether I can get rid<br/>\nof any of the overflow, I rotate one or two games back in from the<br/>\ngarage.  I bring them in and stick them on a table, rather than inside<br/>\nthe cabinet we have.  One of my main objectives with strewing is to<br/>\ncirculate things.  I believe if unschooling/life ever gets dull a fine<br/>\nway to liven it up is to clean out a closet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do strewing for a few minutes a couple of times a month, if I think<br/>\nabout it.  If I tidied up more often, I might strew more often.  When I<br/>\nclean up I&#39;m always amazed at the things that I find that *I* have<br/>\nforgotten we have.  If I have a problem, &lt;g&gt; it&#39;s compulsive shopping<br/>\n(thrift shops), not compulsive strewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure I waste more of my time stepping over stuff my son has<br/>\nstrewn on the floor than he could possibly waste swerving or detouring<br/>\nover what I put out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly think that school-at-home parents who make their kids spend<br/>\ntime on a subject they select are warping their kids, or at least<br/>\nsquandering some of their time that could be spent better.  However, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think my kid is going to be lured away from his own developmental<br/>\njourney because I&#39;m rolling golden apples across his path.  He has a<br/>\npowerful ability to make his own choices and to say &quot;no&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Strewing","postDate":"1022687783","msgId":37766,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNS5lZjkzMWJkLjJhMjY1NDI3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37763,"nextInTopic":102279,"prevInTime":37765,"nextInTime":37767,"topicId":37575,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/29/02 9:47:39 AM, ecsamhill@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2051983636\">In a message dated 5/29/02 9:47:39 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  However, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think my kid is going to be lured away from his own developmental<br/>\njourney because I&#39;m rolling golden apples across his path.
