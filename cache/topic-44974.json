Still does.  If I sit on the floor he will come over and <br/>\nsit his rear in my lap...mind you he is towering over me.  Once when <br/>\nhe was sick he tried for a good 15 minutes to get in my lap...gave <br/>\nup and lied down next to me.  He will also back up to the couch and <br/>\nsit down on it with all four feet still on the floor! What a site.  <br/>\nWhat&#39;s worse is his expression because he is not allowed on the <br/>\ncouch and he knows it!  We had to watch him with my youngest one too <br/>\nfor a while because his tail could pack a punch.  There was one <br/>\nincident where my husband had been gone for a long time.  He drove <br/>\nup in the driveway (diesel truck)and the kids ran out the door <br/>\nscreaming for daddy.  Zade was at the window whimpering like crazy, <br/>\nso I let him run out too.  Big mistake.  He made a bee line for kid <br/>\n#1 and boom...knocked him off his feet...then kid #2, same thing.  <br/>\nThen ran happily to dad with two kids crying in the background.  As <br/>\nupset as we were with him it really was funny.  That only happened <br/>\nonce though.  Zade tried to chew on a piece of furniture once and we <br/>\nsprayed it with bitter apple spray and he never touched it again, <br/>\nbut I&#39;ve heard that the spray doesn&#39;t phase some dogs.

He is three years old this month <br/>\nand we are in the process of having him flown over to Okinawa in a <br/>\nweek.  We miss him so much...but had to wait for the heat <br/>\nrestrictions to pass.  We have not had too many challenges with <br/>\nZade.  He is such a great dog!  What kind of challenges are you <br/>\nfacing?  Zade is with our breeder right now in Oregon.  She is a <br/>\nwonderful person and we did our homework...no backyard breeders!  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been around many Mastiffs and never encountered a negative <br/>\ndisposition.  They of course need socialization as with any dog and <br/>\nbecome very attached to their families.  So many of these large <br/>\nbreeds are abandoned once people realize how big they get ...very <br/>\nsad.  We have 4 years and 4 months left in the military and when we <br/>\nare done we plan on doing a few Mastiff rescues.  We would like to <br/>\nhave a few more, but our current lifestyle isn&#39;t appropriate for <br/>\na &quot;few&quot; more.  I just love Mastiffs...so sweet and gentle..except <br/>\nfor the tail.  The kids will lie down on the floor with him and lift <br/>\nhis jowls to see his teeth, they look into his ears and check his <br/>\ntoes...he doesn&#39;t mind a bit.  We did crate train Zade too for a <br/>\nlittle over a year.  That helped tremendously.
