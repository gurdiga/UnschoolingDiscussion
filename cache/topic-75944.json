Wow.  Is this a creature menagerie from FLA. or from another dimension or have I been too sheltered?  Do tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, our new ants were very busy in their &quot;farm &quot; last night and have created all kinds of tunnels.  They remove one grain of sand at a time, bringing it all the way out of the tunnel and then going back for the next one.  Infinite patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nn&#39;t forget!

Just a few hours ago we received the ants we ordered a month ago.  We have had this ant farm kit since last summer.  We were inspired to finally order the ants when Gillen and Jesse and I spent about twenty minutes one afternoon on our deck watching one ant carry a piece of dead insect- that was bigger than the ant - to its nest in our house wall. It had to crawl across many gaps in the wooden boards and we were cheering it on the whoe way.  I have gotten so into watching animals with theboys that I started video taping all of our animal finds several years ago- our own nature video.  The I saw &quot;Microcosmos&quot; last week (a movie with amazing close up animal photography) and I have taken a break.  It is more fun to just watch live, for now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe irony of the ants we ordered is that they are fire ants - the same ants that farmer DH is attempting to get rid of at the farm on a daily basis (grits works pretty well).  Here I am trying to find the perfect little water dish for them and telling the kids not to jostle them too much in their vial.  I&#39;m essentially nurturing the ants!  Ants that had been flown across the country to us (free coupon at least) so that I wouldn&#39;t have to go risk being bitten by finding them at the farm!  Of course, if these die too soon, I&#39;m in trouble. <br/>\n<br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo! Groups SponsorADVERTISEMENT<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
