If<br/>\n&gt; a child likes to paint, a prent can incorp. history,<br/>\n&gt; science and math into it.  A child likes to cook,<br/>\n&gt; measuring cup is math, evolution from cake batter to<br/>\n&gt; cake bread is science and so on.  If a parent teaches<br/>\n&gt; math one week, science the next, that is learning.  If<br/>\n&gt; you take a drive and the sign says ten miles to go and<br/>\n&gt; then 8 miles to go then you can incorp. that as<br/>\n&gt; educational teaching of math.  One last time, how you<br/>\n&gt; teach your child is your choice,  to out right refuse<br/>\n&gt; to teach your child is another!  Child led learning<br/>\n&gt; allows the child to learn in the manner the parent<br/>\n&gt; decides is suited to that child.  Child led learning<br/>\n&gt; is still guided with the parents help and the parent<br/>\n&gt; keeping a record of that childs progress with or<br/>\n&gt; without an actual grading system of points.  I am only<br/>\n&gt; saying a parent who thinks unschooling means your<br/>\n&gt; child does not have to leearn to read and write, add<br/>\n&gt; and subtract just because the world  requires this or<br/>\n&gt; the child feels they don&#39;t want to is taking the term<br/>\n&gt; unschooling out of context.  Your can teach your child<br/>\n&gt; using unconvetional methods, you have to keep a<br/>\n&gt; portfolio of your childs learning progress, and the<br/>\n&gt; law does mandate required subjects and it mandates 180<br/>\n&gt; days of such learning.  If you are teaching or<br/>\n&gt; allowing your child to learn in a manner that is<br/>\n&gt; learning, your teaching!  If your child plays all day,<br/>\n&gt; has no clue at age 9 how to read see spot run, you are<br/>\n&gt; not unschooling, you are just not schooling period!<br/>\n&gt; That is the point I am trying to get across.
