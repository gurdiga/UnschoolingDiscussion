We&#39;ve never really used one with <br/>\n&gt;Accalia.<br/>\n&gt;I have a NoJo but really don&#39;t like it, and I&#39;m contemplating buying a Maya<br/>\n&gt;Wrap Pouch. I always hear such good things about OTSBH, but I&#39;m not a big<br/>\n&gt;fan of all of that padding.<br/>\n&gt;    Hey, isn&#39;t babywearing in different cultures a great topic for your <br/>\n&gt;kids<br/>\n&gt;to learn about?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;Amy Nelson<br/>\n&gt;Mama to Accalia (6/14/99)<br/>\n&gt;&quot;The hardest to learn was the least complicated.&quot; - The Indigo Girls<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I know how you feel. A couple of my best friends got together and bought<br/>\n&gt;me a very nice playpen/sleeper before Gary was born and I never used it.We<br/>\n&gt;always either held him or kept him in a sling. I didn&#39;t conciously choose <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;be an attachment parent, I&#39;d never heard the term before, it was just<br/>\n&gt;natural to me.It was what my instinct told me to do.<br/>\n&gt;My own father never quite got it.He asked me once when Gary was about four<br/>\n&gt;months old &quot; If he doesn&#39;t sleep during the day, what does he do?&quot; he<br/>\n&gt;couldn&#39;t understand why I wouldn&#39;t put him in a crib and leave him in<br/>\n&gt;another room! And this is a  man who has 3 children of his own!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9413,"nextTopicId":9420}}
