When she got to the circle (after about 15 min.) she said, <br/>\n&quot;You know, a covenant group doesn&#39;t look like ANYTHING from outside.  <br/>\nIt looks like you are all just sitting there doing nothing.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\neven look like anyone is talking.&quot;  Well, a covenant group is a way to <br/>\ndeeply connect with others - with very intentional listening happening <br/>\nwhen anyone is talking.
