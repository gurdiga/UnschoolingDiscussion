We live below our means, on a budget. We don&#39;t<br/>\nconsider shopping a pastime.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not always this way.  I&#39;ve been on the buybuybuy treadmill, I<br/>\nremember the nagging guilty feelings at the cash register, the night-time<br/>\nworrying, and the thrill of finding a &#39;bargain&#39; on some unnecessary item<br/>\nthat I just had to have.  When we decided that something had to change, we<br/>\njust stopped shopping.  That simple.  We throw away catalogs without looking<br/>\nat them.  We came up with a yearly budget.  We agreed never to have another<br/>\ncredit card.  We only go to a store when there is something we NEED.<br/>\nThinking about what a need is made a huge difference for us.  We started<br/>\nputting any money we could find into savings - even if it was .02.  If the<br/>\nelectric budget was $50, and the bill was $48.50, $1.50 went into savings.<br/>\nWe couldn&#39;t believe how quickly those small amounts added up.  We do buy<br/>\nthings that we want, but not on impulse, and not without making sure we can<br/>\nspare the money first.  Our whole perspective has changed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are by no means wealthy, and Jon had been laid off for over a year, but<br/>\nwe are in control of what money we do have.  I don&#39;t think it matters how<br/>\nmuch you make (I&#39;m not talking about truly impoverished families) - anyone<br/>\ncan make a budget and stick to it if they decide to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re all responsible for our own grass.  If it doesn&#39;t look green enough,<br/>\nwe&#39;re the only ones who can change it.  The same way we can be at peace in<br/>\nour families because of the choices we make, we can be at peace with our<br/>\nmoney because of the choices we make.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143181466,"authorName":"melissa4123","from":"&quot;melissa4123&quot; &lt;melissa4123@...&gt;","profile":"melissa4123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and funds was  Feeling alienated from non-homeschool moms","postDate":"1052763499","msgId":68717,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5b29oYityZ2kyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI5b205aCs0ZnVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68715,"nextInTopic":68731,"prevInTime":68716,"nextInTime":68718,"topicId":68694,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Laura, reading you post brought tears to my eyes.

My DH and I have just<br/>\ncrawled out of that hole you are talking about.  He was laid off after<br/>\n9/11 (he worked for American Airlines in SF).  Luckily, I was able to<br/>\ngo back to my pre-mommy job and we earned the same amount of money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that ended when my DH decided that he wanted to move us to Fresno,<br/>\nCA to be closer to his family.  He just didn&#39;t feel like a man when he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be the one to &quot;bring home the bacon.&quot;  So...off we moved<br/>\n(about 3 to 4 hours south of where we were).  He worked several<br/>\ndifferent jobs, trying to find something that not only paid the bills<br/>\nbut made him happy as well.  We lived with his parents for about a<br/>\nmonth before he just couldn&#39;t take it any more and we moved to an apt.<br/>\n Shortly after that, he quit his next job and we were both unemployed<br/>\nfor about a month.  We had no savings and no income, I still don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how I managed to pay the bills.  And, let me tell you, there was<br/>\nNOTHING extra and I mean nothing.  We turned off the cable and were<br/>\nthinking of having the phone turned off when his brother sent us a<br/>\ncheck for $1000!  They didn&#39;t even call to say the money was<br/>\ncoming...I just went out the mail box one afternoon and there it was.<br/>\n When we called to say thank you they just said that they had been<br/>\nthere and do that and they wanted to help.  Told us if we needed more,<br/>\nto call and not to worry about paying them back.  That&#39;s when things<br/>\nstarted to change for the better.  My husband, through a network of<br/>\nold friends, got a great job working for an airline here in town. <br/>\nNow, a year later, we own a home and have started to pay some of the<br/>\ncredit card bills down.  We can just now go to Target or Wal-mart and<br/>\nbuy a pair of jeans, if we need them.  That&#39;s not to say that we just<br/>\ngo and spend only that we have less worries now than before.  But, we<br/>\nalso learned from our mistakes of spending beyond our means.  If we<br/>\nhad saved when he had that great job with American, we never would<br/>\nhave been in that mess to begin with.  So....now we put money into a<br/>\nsavings account every month.  There&#39;s not much there now but, there<br/>\nwill be soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can honestly say that, we never once fought over money.  Both of us<br/>\nhave seen what can happen when you start to do that and just didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to go there.  That experience only made us more solid that we<br/>\nalready were.  We can even look back and smile at that time and wonder<br/>\nhow we ever paid bills and put food on the table.  But, it is true<br/>\nwhat Olga said about the wealthy also living beyond their means.  The<br/>\nmore money you make, the more you spend.  If you can just hand in<br/>\nthere, I&#39;m sure things will start to look up.  Something I started to<br/>\ndo that made me feel better every day.  I kept a journal and every<br/>\nnight, after my little girl had gone to bed, I wrote 5 things that I<br/>\nwas thankful for during that day.  Once you start to be grateful and<br/>\nthankful for what you DO have, it makes the negitave much easier to<br/>\ndeal with.  You aren&#39;t alone, try to remember that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Olga&quot; &lt;britcontoo@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Laura,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am sorry you are struggling.

We have been lucky thus far in that <br/>\nwe have enough to get by and a little extra but who knows what the <br/>\nfuture holds.  It does give me alot of faith when I hear others tell <br/>\nme they are happy with less and are managing.  I am trying to make <br/>\nsteps towards that on a daily basis.  My dh could care less, he is <br/>\nwonderful about being happy with where he is.  His family lost his <br/>\nbrother in a fire before he was born but that loss effects my dh to <br/>\nthis day.  He is not materialistic and I am  trying to get better <br/>\nabout it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a very affluent neighborhood (we bought our house for <br/>\nalmost nothing and then there was a huge boom).  We have been fixing <br/>\nour house ourselves slowly.  Homes in our neighborhood are benig <br/>\nknocked down to make way for million dollar homes on the water.  The <br/>\nfunny thing is me and dh were discussing this the other day.  He <br/>\nsaid, we all spend the same in a sense.  If you have more, you spend <br/>\nmore but are we truley more free?  For example, I had to pick up <br/>\nsomething from a mom from my mommy & me program.  She lives on the <br/>\nwater in a very wealthy area.  Her house was all remodoled, HUGE.  <br/>\nBut, I noticed her windows were still old and so was her kitchen.  I <br/>\nthought, here is this woman who probably pays about $20,000 a year a <br/>\nin taxes alone and they can&#39;t even have it all.  Even the wealthy <br/>\nlive above their means, it is just not so obvious to the rest of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it is frustrating.  I have a friends who both work and their <br/>\nkids are in preschool.  They did the Disney cruise and are planning <br/>\nto go again.  I had this twinge of jealousy.  Then I thought, you <br/>\nknow what I am on vacation with my kids everday!  I could go to work <br/>\nand make a nice income and we could have vacations and a bigger house <br/>\nbut my choices tell me that is not important.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour beleifs and choices tell you it is more important to give your <br/>\nson an amazing childhood and memories.  That family is more important <br/>\nthan money.  Just try and remember what you enjoy about these choices <br/>\nbecause it is all too easy to see what we do not have.  Lord knows, I <br/>\nam trying to remember that too!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, HMSL2@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 5/12/2003 9:58:54 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt; diamondair@e... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; One thing I&#39;ve noted that is interesting (this is veering off on <br/>\na tangent,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but oh well here goes) is when people post about their <br/>\nunschooling days,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; almost all of the posts I&#39;ve read involved going somewhere and <br/>\nbuying<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something - Target, WalMart, whatever.

We are actually the ones that went to B & N and I spent <br/>\n40.00 and <br/>\n&gt; sat and had a capachino (sp) with my son.
