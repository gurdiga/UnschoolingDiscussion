(I also studied how the casinos <br/>\noperate psychologically, but that is for another thread!)<br/>\n<br/>\n       A big eye-opener for me was realizing that gambling games are math <br/>\nmagic and that math magic and illusions are just like all magic and illusions -- <br/>\nfrom tic-tac-toe to Houdini -- once you &quot;get&quot; the underlying structure and why <br/>\nit works, it is less interesting to just see it or do it over and over the <br/>\nsame way. The fun is in the discovery of new tricks and then sharing them with <br/>\neach other! &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are lots of ways to change game rules - sometimes a simple <br/>\n&gt; seemingly innocuous change can have major impacts on how the game plays <br/>\n&gt; out and what the outcome is.  What if you let people have the option of <br/>\n&gt; skipping a turn, for example? Or - what if at the end of a turn they <br/>\n&gt; roll a die and call out a number - if they get a match with the number <br/>\n&gt; on the die, they get an extra turn.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh - and when you make up games and they flop - be sure to examine why <br/>\n&gt; they flop - that is a big huge part of what mathematicians do, too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82293,"nextTopicId":82290}}
