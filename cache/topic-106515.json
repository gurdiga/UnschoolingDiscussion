And it sounds like your daughter is just thrilled with <br/>\nthe decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is truly inspirational, and I would strongly encourage you to <br/>\nattend the Live and Learn Conference Kelly mentioned--you will leave <br/>\nthoroughly inspired and recharged after spending several days in a hotel <br/>\nfull of other Unschoolers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also like to invite you to join the AlwaysUnschooled e-list ( <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a> ) as well where you&#39;ll <br/>\nbe able to chat with lots of moms and a dad or two who Unschool young <br/>\nchildren. It&#39;s great to &quot;hang out&quot; with a bunch of parents dealing with <br/>\nthe same joys and the same struggles, and it compliments the veteran <br/>\nwisdom you&#39;ll find here at UnschoolingDiscussion very nicely, I think. <br/>\nFor me, it&#39;s nice to hear both the &quot;I&#39;m going through that now, too, and <br/>\nhere&#39;s how I&#39;m dealing with it&quot; as well as the &quot;I&#39;ve been there done <br/>\nthat and it will all work out if you just relax and trust them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re also welcome to check out my webpage and my blog linked from it ( <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a> ) where you <br/>\ncan read lots about my three children, Emily (7), Julia (6) and Sam (5). <br/>\nWe&#39;re getting ready to move to a 5.24 acre farmette, and we&#39;re very <br/>\nexcited!

I have no doubt it will all fall into place <br/>\nover night when it becomes important to her. My 6 year old is no where <br/>\nclose to reading, but she likes to &quot;work&quot; at it. She likes to sit down <br/>\nand *do* things, but often in fleeting bursts. Again, I trust that her <br/>\napproach is exactly what *she* needs and that it will all fall into <br/>\nplace for her as well when she&#39;s ready.

We grow corn <br/>\nand beans, and have a stable where we board horses. My husband works <br/>\na day job for half the year usually, though it looks like he will <br/>\nwork all year this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stumbled across &quot;unschooling&quot; when looking for homeschooling <br/>\ninformation when my daughter was only 3...I had her in preschool for <br/>\n6 weeks and yanked her out immediatly after we visited and observed <br/>\nthe class inconspicuoisly. Shortly after that I read the Unschooling <br/>\nHandbook and, well, never looked back. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom time to time I get hung up on &quot;homeschooling&quot; because part of <br/>\nme really feels like she will really enjoy life more if &quot;she&#39;d just <br/>\nlearn to read!&quot;...but she is teaching herself to some degree - site <br/>\nreading many words and even sounding out a few. But she has a speech <br/>\nhang up (impediment, whatever) and it really seems to impede her <br/>\nunderstanding of word structure. I keep waiting for *that* to <br/>\nmagically fix itself because the alternative is speech therapy. <br/>\nAND....that would mean taking her to the school district and it <br/>\nwould mean getting her shots up to date (I&#39;m not crazy about it and <br/>\nfrankly neither is Jocelyn - my husband on the other hand is crazy <br/>\nwith anxiety that she hasn&#39;t had all of her shots *sigh*).<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from running the stable, I was running a small business <br/>\nselling handmade soaps and lotions. That business really took off <br/>\nand I became so busy that recently it occurred to me that I <br/>\nwas &quot;working&quot; and my daughter, house, diet, health, and sanity were <br/>\nall suffering because of it. My house became a pig-sty, I became <br/>\nanxious and resentful (my hobby was taking over my life and ruining <br/>\nmy day...even the horses were suffering because of my lack of time <br/>\nand organization). So last month I quit...closed up shop. Jocelyn <br/>\nwas so glad when I made the decision that she ran up to her daddy <br/>\nwhen he walked in and said &quot;Mommy&#39;s not going to sell soap anymore, <br/>\nso now she can spend time with me!&quot;...pretty clear that I made the <br/>\nright choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have spent the last month playing with the horses (no big <br/>\nsurprise that as Unschoolers we also practice Natural Horsemanship, <br/>\nwhich is basically Unschooling for horses), working in the garden, <br/>\nand TRYING to get the house organized. But I&#39;ve lost something over <br/>\nthe last 2 years since my business overwhelmed me: <br/>\ndirection and motivation. I still can&#39;t seem to get the house <br/>\norganized and I&#39;m not used to focusing on &quot;play&quot; with Jocelyn.
