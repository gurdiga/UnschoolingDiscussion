It&#39;s been <br/>\nvery confusing and a wee bit frustrating so far as I haven&#39;t been <br/>\nable to get any definitive answers from the folks I&#39;ve queried <br/>\nonline or off.

Our ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1323198211\">Hi Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI skimmed through Sandra&#39;s SCA pages again and followed a few links, <br/>\nbut wanted to ask if anyone here has a favorite supplier or two.  Our <br/>\ndaughter, Fawn, is celebrating her twelfth today, and her fondest <br/>\nbirthday wish was to find material and notions to make the Renaissance <br/>\ncostume pattern (Simplicity) we bought months ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been having a tough time finding materials and notions as newbie <br/>\nRenaissance wannabees and seamstresses, especially since my research <br/>\ntime has been limited due to a computer crash.   I&#39;ve been posting on <br/>\nborrowed time (thanks to my kids&#39; generosity :o) for longer than I&#39;d <br/>\nlike *understatement.*  You never know how much you rely on a machine <br/>\nuntil it&#39;s gone, eh?  Anyway, we could use some help from all you <br/>\ncreative folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe family attended our first Renfest in GA last year and my older <br/>\ndaughter, Nike, found a beautiful outfit with a vest that is close to <br/>\nour family tartan.  The pattern Fawn picked out is similar in style, <br/>\nand we have some extra tartan material to use for the vest.  Now the <br/>\ndevil is in the details, and I&#39;d really like to follow the next <br/>\nproject through to completion -- Nike&#39;s Civil War dress is still in <br/>\npieces after unsuccessfully trying to adapt a wedding dress to the <br/>\nright configurations... novices &#39;r&#39; us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe local fabric shops don&#39;t carry the items that the pattern requires <br/>\n(and don&#39;t know who does around here,) and we have no idea where to <br/>\nbegin to find what we need online. Any advice would be greatly <br/>\nappreciated.  Thanks!  Penne & the Clan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105373,"nextTopicId":105400}}
