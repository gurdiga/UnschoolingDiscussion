The following letter was cc&#39;d to me: <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Dear<br/>\nDebra, Many thanks for the email. Unfortunately the Judge decided<br/>\nagainst us. She seemed to think that because William is a shy and<br/>\nsensitive boy that it would be better for him to be in a place where<br/>\nhe can interact with other children - ie school. Personally I think<br/>\nthat school is one of the reasons why he has a problem interacting. <br/>\nTo<br/>\nbe honest I think that the Judge just couldn&#39;t bring herself to<br/>\ndismiss the case and she just had to find something to justify her<br/>\ndecision. She couldn&#39;t do it t on the standard of education and so <br/>\nshe<br/>\ndid it on the socializing. The solicitor said afterwards that she was<br/>\nvery wrong in her decision so he is still behind us, and even the<br/>\nreporters afterwards were saying that it didn&#39;t make sense. I hope to<br/>\nget a copy of the Judgement which I will forward to HEN [Home<br/>\nEducation Network]. We are going to appeal the decision as I have<br/>\nabsolutely no intention of sending William to school against his<br/>\nwishes. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe fear that the authorities will use &quot;socialisation&quot; as their excuse<br/>\nin the future for insisting that &quot;every child&#39;s educational needs<br/>\nwould best be met in school&quot; .<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we are investigating whether there is any research out there on <br/>\nthe<br/>\nrelative merits of socialisation in school and socialisation in the<br/>\nhome. Paula Rothermel, Amanda Petrie and Alan Thomas are all <br/>\nbeing<br/>\ncontacted for their advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any ideas about lines of inquiry we could pursue, please<br/>\nlet me know!<br/>\n<br/>\nBws<br/>\nDonal<br/>\n------- End of forwarded message -------</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13108,"nextTopicId":13217}}
