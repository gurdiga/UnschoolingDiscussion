Although, I do <br/>\nnot know what level his instructor is ( brown, black belt, etc)   He is a <br/>\nvery nice man.  Very &quot;formal&quot; karate stuff, ( yessir, no sir, all that stuff) <br/>\n But, he does a great job with the kids, he is very aware and attentive to <br/>\nwhat each student needs to work on.  He kind of reminds me of a vietnam vet <br/>\nhippie type dude.  very cool.  :-).  Anyway, back to the fees.  This fella <br/>\noffers a 2 week free trial at the beginning of every summer to homeschoolers <br/>\nto see if they would like to sign up for the summer class.   About 30 folks <br/>\nsigned up for the trial, about 20 showed up, and only 4 stayed. ( I have no <br/>\nidea why, I guess it was not thier cuppa tea)  He already had about a dozen <br/>\nstudents.    He has class 3 times a week MWF, for an hour (1:30-2:30)  They <br/>\nhold class at the local boys and girls club at the Salvation Army rec center. <br/>\n I was shocked when he told me the monthly fee.  I was expecting it to be a <br/>\nlot, since he offered  a free trial to get us hooked.. lol.   We had to pay a <br/>\nyearly fee of $10 to use the rec center.  The instructor charges $27/month <br/>\nfor the class.  I was expecting something well over $50.    I do know they <br/>\nhave tests, because JP was talking about them  They have some yellow and <br/>\norange belts in the class.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been SOO lucky in finding wonderful folks and programs for my kids <br/>\ninterests that  I can not help them learn ( not to the extent they want to <br/>\nlearn)   I barter french  &quot;time&quot; with a lady for Anna.  Her daughter comes <br/>\nover and takes guitar  from my Dh.  Anna&#39;s piano lessons are only $10 per <br/>\nweek for a 45 min lesson.  We paid $27.50 for that length of lesson for <br/>\nLandon about 5 years ago!!.   And now, JP&#39;s karate class turns out to be very <br/>\naffordable too.  The resources are out there, you just have to network and <br/>\nLOOK!<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68041,"nextTopicId":67556}}
