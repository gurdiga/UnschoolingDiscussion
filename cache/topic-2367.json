Rather, WHY most children come? It is a mistake, an error, an accident. Most children are not planned, and something in me says we push each other around something awful. Darned if we do and darned if we don\u0012t. Lots of people do not want children. Abortion, though legal, is frowned upon. Responsibility is out of fashion. So ------- babies are born! We who love our children and we who LIKE our children, even we who VALUE our children are not necessarily the majority. But we ARE the lucky ones, the blessed ones. We can certainly celebrate THAT, can\u0012t we? <br/>\n<br/>\n\u0013. . . . Elizabeth: I&#39;m interested in the apprenticeship question too. I&#39;m curious to see the responses you get. . . .  Beth O in IL\u0014<br/>\nOSHA happened to the apprenticeship, or at least to the allowing of the youngsters to work around \u0013hazardous\u0014 machinery. The apprenticeship was gone long before that, however, when the society became affluent enough to allow children to stay in school years longer and longer. Society moved ages back to match the needs. Schools slowed down \u0016 to snail\u0012s pace in some cases!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nNancy or Brandy or Mildred, probably Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n     Experts aren&#39;t.
