We did that one spring and I tell you, it is still a<br/>\nfavorite memory for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter spent months working on ballet with a book from the<br/>\nlibrary without any lessons at all.

What I noticed was the creeping way that the school had<br/>\n&quot;requirements.&quot; I hear about them now all the time as a business owner<br/>\nwho offers services that the charter schools want to pay for. Kids are<br/>\nexpected to &quot;produce&quot; X number of essays in a year or they haven&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;moved up&quot; to the next grade level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve discovered that many of us (businesses) won&#39;t work with<br/>\ncharter schools because they are notoriously bad at paying on time or<br/>\nat all.

The ES may be willing to meet<br/>\nyou somewhere without Rachael present if that is helpful.  As for testing,<br/>\nMy charter (one county over from you) doesn&#39;t require testing for K-3.  They<br/>\ndo for the older grades.  But that gives you 4 years to dicker before having<br/>\nto make that difficult decision. <br/>\nMy last recommendation is to find out who the best es is for unschoolers and<br/>\ntry to get a transfer to her.

Thing is, in my financial situation<br/>\n&gt; $600/yr would be A LOT to buy some books, or craft<br/>\n&gt; type stuff or let her take ballet or gymnastics or<br/>\n&gt; iceskating (things dd has asked for).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in CA, too, and I think I know the charter you&#39;re talking about. I have<br/>\nfriends in it. So, some of what I&#39;m going to write will be specific to that<br/>\ncharter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, the money that is apparently now $600 a year was originally, I<br/>\nthink, $1200-$1500 a year. It has been gradually reduced over the last few<br/>\nyears. The items you buy with the money have to be, by the school&#39;s jargon,<br/>\nconsumed -- like classes or paper & crayons -- or they must be returned. So,<br/>\nthe people who were prompted to join by the idea of $1200 in school supplies<br/>\nnow have to go through the same hassle of record-keeping and meetings with<br/>\nthe ES for half the money. I could see it getting even lower. The ESes, BTW,<br/>\nget paid more than $1,000 a student for their every-20-days meetings and<br/>\npaperwork. You can&#39;t buy from any vendor that has any religious materials in<br/>\ntheir catalog. You can&#39;t buy anything that remotely resembles clothing -- no<br/>\ncostumes or those nice silky squares that you&#39;ll see in Waldorfy catalogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homeschool charters I&#39;m familiar with in CA all require standardized<br/>\ntesting. A lot of the parents realized that they actually didn&#39;t legally<br/>\nhave to test, but since it&#39;s a charter school, the school was able to say,<br/>\n&quot;No, you&#39;re not legally required to test in public school, but we can say<br/>\nthat if you want to be in our special public school you have to test.&quot; I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know all the details. It was apparently painful for the school<br/>\nadministration to make this pronouncement, because it was started by people<br/>\nwith a strong unschooling or at least relaxed homeschooling bent, but<br/>\nthere&#39;s a certain percentage of students who are required to test or the<br/>\nschool&#39;s existence/funding is as risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not in any charter because I consider my time and freedom for my kids as<br/>\nmuch more valuable than the money, which at this point is truly a pittance<br/>\ncompared to the hassle. I don&#39;t want someone in my house -- or to have to<br/>\nmake arrangements to meet somewhere else every three weeks. I don&#39;t want<br/>\nsomeone quizzing my kids. I don&#39;t want to sit down and analyze what we do<br/>\nevery day. I don&#39;t want to give someone else, someone whom I would be<br/>\nexpected to please, so much power in my life. The ESes vary in quality as<br/>\nwell. Some are very focused on bureaucracy -- one ES threatened a friend of<br/>\nmine with reporting her children as truant when they had a miscommunication<br/>\nabout an appointment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also nowhere near wealthy, although we undoubtedly have fewer<br/>\nfinancial pressures than many. We live in LA, where renting a house that is<br/>\nappropriate for a family with four children costs nearly 50 percent of my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s income (some of that is because we&#39;re new to the area -- people<br/>\nwho have been here for years previously have lower rents or mortgage<br/>\npayments -- and some is because journalists don&#39;t get paid all that much).<br/>\nWe shopped around for six months to find this place. I spend most of my work<br/>\ntime (I work from home) on a project for a nonprofit that is an extension of<br/>\nmy volunteer work and doesn&#39;t pay market rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we seriously watch our pennies, but I really don&#39;t feel like the kids are<br/>\nmissing out. My 7yo is doing a lot of ice skating (she did gymnastics during<br/>\nthe school year), and my son plays organized baseball year-round. In LA,<br/>\nthere is always a super-expensive way to do things, and it&#39;s easy to feel<br/>\ndeprived if that&#39;s all you know about. But there are always less-expensive<br/>\noptions, too. I&#39;ve chosen to take the time I would be spending going through<br/>\ncharter school hassles to bargain hunt!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I could say my main point about enrolling in a charter more<br/>\nsuccinctly: I&#39;ve watched my friends in the charters jump through more and<br/>\nmore hoops for less and less money.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\nin LA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooling and Charters - a Conundrum of Sorts","postDate":"1125036375","msgId":107946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwODI1MTUxNTQxLjIxNTAwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyODAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":107943,"nextInTopic":107950,"prevInTime":107945,"nextInTime":107947,"topicId":107933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-313422861\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I work part-time from home less than 20 hrs a week<br/>\ncurrently.

The fact that school for me is in the<br/>\nevenings leads me to feel that sending her off to<br/>\nschool is not going to really make much of a<br/>\ndiffference and that if I can find a good support<br/>\nsystem  (which I already am doing), then I&#39;ll still<br/>\nhave the needed time to study and continue to<br/>\nunschool. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of homeschooling support groups in California. Try www.nhen.org or<br/>\nemail me privately with your locality (in case we are neighbors - I have<br/>\nsome useful inexpensive resources).  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And now I&#39;m going to whine....I don&#39;t want to have to<br/>\nwrite down everything we did on every school day in<br/>\n&quot;educationalese&quot;.....I quite enjoy leaving the idea of<br/>\n&quot;subjects&quot; in the far back of my consciousness where<br/>\nit belongs.  But, there are 6 subjects and they<br/>\nrequire me to write what we did every day for those 6<br/>\nsubjects and to hand in a sample once every 20<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; days from each subject. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about living in California is that there is no<br/>\nrequirement from the State to do *any* of this stuff - as you said - the<br/>\nstate does not require any form of assessments or testing if you use one of<br/>\nthe private school options. Therefore this assessing and assigning and<br/>\nrequiring really is coming entirely from the Charter School. Maybe you can<br/>\nask for another ES or negotiate something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people who do Charter want the &quot;help&quot; and guidance. The idea of having<br/>\nsome money to buy any educational material they want sounds like freedom in<br/>\ncomparison to the strictures and book lists and required stationary lists of<br/>\nregular schools. I agree that you have to ask yourself whether the money is<br/>\nworth the unpleasant obligations. It is not for me. Just the ideas that<br/>\nthere is some teacher judging Jayn and some files placed somewhere<br/>\ncontaining these evaluations, are so abhorrent to me that I chose to home<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust in passing I don&#39;t even consider the idea of &quot;subjects&quot; as belonging<br/>\neven deep in my consciousness, but rather actively purge it with the<br/>\nopposing concept of connections and gestalt learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the Unschoolers I know IRL locally are in Charters, so I have no<br/>\nrecommendations of other Charter schools that might be more genuinely US<br/>\nfriendly. However that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist. You might try asking<br/>\non the HSC e-list ( www.hsc.org )<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly you can decide if you genuinely have the time and energy to combine<br/>\nUnschooling with both work and your studies. Sometimes it takes difficult<br/>\nprioritizing. It may be that you have to cut back on some classes and take<br/>\njust a little longer to complete your degree. OTOH it may be that you will<br/>\nfind some other parents in similar situations to trade off playdates/study<br/>\ntime. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m<br/>\njust whining, but it seems like such a huge<br/>\ninterruption of my time and real unschooling to have<br/>\nto do this stuff.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an interruption and you do have better things to do with your time. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I wanted to continue with the plan of<br/>\nunschooling my 5 yr old dd.  However, as a single mom<br/>\ngoing to school myself and trying to make everything<br/>\nwork financially, I&#39;ve been feeling much pressure to<br/>\njust put her into the ps this fall for Kindergarten. <br/>\nIt&#39;s really difficult when people who are in the same<br/>\nsituation and even vastly better situations<br/>\nfinancailly are sending their kids off to school after<br/>\nhaving homeschooled/unschooled for several years. <br/>\nBut, that&#39;s beside the point.  Here, I&#39;m looking at<br/>\nour individual circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work part-time from home less than 20 hrs a week<br/>\ncurrently.  I also am going to be in grad school 2<br/>\nnights a week.  The fact that school for me is in the<br/>\nevenings leads me to feel that sending her off to<br/>\nschool is not going to really make much of a<br/>\ndiffference and that if I can find a good support<br/>\nsystem  (which I already am doing), then I&#39;ll still<br/>\nhave the needed time to study and continue to<br/>\nunschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my question:  I&#39;ve signed up for a charter<br/>\nschool that &quot;says&quot; they support unschooling, but when<br/>\nI spoke with the ES (Education Specialist) last night,<br/>\nit&#39;s clear she really has no clue what unschooling<br/>\nreally means and certainly does not support it, she<br/>\nfears it in fact.  Thing is, in my financial situation<br/>\n$600/yr would be A LOT to buy some books, or craft<br/>\ntype stuff or let her take ballet or gymnastics or<br/>\niceskating (things dd has asked for).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, after talking to the ES, it seems that quite a<br/>\npercentage would have to be used for &quot;curriculum&quot;-type<br/>\nstuff.  And that probably reatlistically leaves about<br/>\n$400 or less for the year for our own discretion. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not like i&#39;d use the curriculum anyhow, but would<br/>\njust buy it to appease the ES and leave it on the<br/>\nbookshelf.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I&#39;m going to whine....I don&#39;t want to have to<br/>\nwrite down everything we did on every school day in<br/>\n&quot;educationalese&quot;.....I quite enjoy leaving the idea of<br/>\n&quot;subjects&quot; in the far back of my consciousness where<br/>\nit belongs.  But, there are 6 subjects and they<br/>\nrequire me to write what we did every day for those 6<br/>\nsubjects and to hand in a sample once every 20<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; days from each subject.  I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m<br/>\njust whining, but it seems like such a huge<br/>\ninterruption of my time and real unschooling to have<br/>\nto do this stuff.   The state does not require it and<br/>\nI am personally not worried at all about it.  DD is a<br/>\nvery curious child and has picked up WAY more than<br/>\nmost K aged kids that have been in preschool and K<br/>\ntheir whole lives.  I have not sat down and taught her<br/>\nanything, but she loves to write constantly and she&#39;s<br/>\npretty good at basic math too, just from being<br/>\ncurious.  And she knows a lot about the world and<br/>\nnature....it&#39;s incredible how unschooling (or living<br/>\nlife!)  has been working.  We are very active most<br/>\ndays and yet she has days to just veg at home if she<br/>\nwants interspersed in there.  The playdates have<br/>\npicked up quite a bit recently though and she&#39;s been<br/>\nenjoying them, as have I.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe money is appealing....it would give us a chance to<br/>\nDO a bit more.  I&#39;m just worried that it is too big a<br/>\nprice to pay.  I don&#39;t know if I should just suck it<br/>\nup and jump through a few/several hoops.
