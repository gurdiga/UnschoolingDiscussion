Showing joy simply because your child is doing something seems better.  You don&#39;t have to horn in on what they&#39;re doing, but showing satisfaction in their activities would be good.

What is being said is more that your child&#39;s<br/>\ninterests lead them to learn what they need to know whether you take it<br/>\nfrom them and make it a teaching moment.  Am I getting that correctly?<br/>\nAnd yes, I see what I wrote and realized that just saying &quot;take it from<br/>\nthem&quot; sounded awful although that&#39;s what I was doing.  So the YuGiOh<br/>\ncards . if your child develops an interest in them, let them be unless<br/>\nthey ask you for help or want you to join them . don&#39;t look at one of<br/>\nthe cards and start showing them how they relate to math.

I explained to my parents I was not going to be doing<br/>\nschool at home and tried to explain the basics of unschooling.  Now when<br/>\nmy 5 yo, Isabel, brings my mom a piece of paper with her name written on<br/>\nit, my mother makes her watch while she writes it neatly and in caps and<br/>\nlower case and then makes her sit and do it her way.

I have to not<br/>\njust daily remind myself to back off and allow my girls to enjoy life, but<br/>\nsometimes moment after moment.  HOWEVER.......One of the biggest blessings<br/>\nfor me has been relaxing enough to enjoy them.  This for me has been the key<br/>\nto it all.  Before I brought them home from public school I didn&#39;t have the<br/>\ntime or energy left to really KNOW them.  As I watch my 8 yo watch tv all<br/>\nday and I do mean all day sometimes,  I now go and snuggle up in her bed or<br/>\non the couch and watch tv with her.  Those have been some priceless times.<br/>\nShe enjoys cooking so I give her full access to the kitchen and boy can she<br/>\ncook!  My 11yo daughter&#39;s passion is drawing/painting and horses.  She is<br/>\nreally an amazing artist and her mind never shuts off.  She also loves her<br/>\nhorses .  She wears horse ears, a horse tail and has huffs she has made to<br/>\nkeep up with her growing taller.  I had someone a couple of months ago tell<br/>\nme I shouldn&#39;t allow her to walk like a horse or wear the tail and ears.<br/>\nWhy? I thought.  That is who she is, why would I take that from her?  But an<br/>\n11 yo running around like a horse isn&#39;t sociable acceptable I guess....who<br/>\ncares?!   She too will wake me or interupt me to show a horse she has found<br/>\non Stablemates.com and how if she sells &quot;x&quot; amount of paintings at &quot;x&quot; price<br/>\nshe could buy the horse.  Now, why did I tell you all of this?......I used<br/>\nto think she needed to be reading, doing a math related activity (like a<br/>\nworksheet I guess) or writing a report on horses instead.  What I now<br/>\nrealize is that she is learning all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the others who have said, your son  is learning and taking in<br/>\nso much.  Our job as the parent is to be a resource for our children.  Be<br/>\nresourceful, show him where he can learn more about the Yu-Gi-Oh cards or be<br/>\nbetter at playing.  I am not real up on these cards but I know there is much<br/>\nhe can do with them.

I really did have OCD as a child, which has <br/>\nturned into anxiety problems today.  For some reason the above line kind of <br/>\nrubbed me the wrong way - not so much that I am upset, just that I wish you <br/>\ncould understand how it feels to deal with that type of mindset (perhaps you <br/>\nalready do? - often it runs in families).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my point is that my parents were always very controlling.  In <br/>\naddition, they also would look down on activities that I did that they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think were &quot;worthwhile.&quot;  They would charge into my room and turn on <br/>\nthe light if I slept in too long.  My mother also forced me to practice <br/>\nviolin for 8 years even though I obviously hated it because she believed <br/>\nthat someday I would &quot;thank&quot; her.  (I know she meant well at the time.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not blaming my parents for my having OCD; more that if they had not <br/>\nbeen so nit picky, controlling, and constantly in my space that I would <br/>\nprobably have not been such an extremely uptight and unhappy child (and I <br/>\nguess, yes, I don&#39;t really think that my OCD would have amounted to much of <br/>\nanything).  Even today, my mother can say one slightly negative thing and I <br/>\nwill immediately feel extremely stressed and start doing some of my old OCD <br/>\nhabits.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am not at all saying that you are the cause of your son having OCD!!!  <br/>\nJust that I have been there, and the best thing you can do for your son is <br/>\nto RELAX and let him feel in control of himself and be happy with what he <br/>\ndoes.  Believe me, dealing with OCD is no joke and it is horrible to live <br/>\nwith.  In addition, a person who does OCD-type behavious is generally a <br/>\nconsequence of them feeling a personal lack of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nErika  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTake off on a romantic weekend or a family adventure to these great U.S. <br/>\nlocations. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://special.msn.com/local/hotdestinations.armx\">http://special.msn.com/local/hotdestinations.armx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166495566,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"&quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"rooh_","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Learning to see differently","postDate":"1077401939","msgId":91268,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmEwMWMzZjhjOCRiNGYwNGEyMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFjNS4xNGNkMTFhZi4yZDY4NTE0Y0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8MDNkZTAxYzNmODhkJGQ1MjQ5ZWQwJDAzMDBhOGMwQFRpbmtlcmJlbGw+"},"prevInTopic":91265,"nextInTopic":91269,"prevInTime":91267,"nextInTime":91269,"topicId":91221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Part of the journey to unschooling, or learning to see differently, is let go of ALL your preconceived, schoolish notions about learning and really just be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-244486246\">Part of the journey to unschooling, or learning to see differently, is let go of ALL your preconceived, &quot;schoolish&quot; notions about learning and really just be with your kids while they are doing what they enjoy.

One of the other issues I&#39;d like to bring out is the <br/>\nmeasuring tools used in education. Grades, prizes for fact mastery, privileges, <br/>\npunishments.... Unfortunately for us, my son started part time enrollment at the local high <br/>\nschool before we made the unschooling decision. During that year, I watched my <br/>\nconfidence in my son (that he is incredibly talented, able to teach himself loads of <br/>\ncomplicated stuff, motivated and competent) slowly drain. I watched him do poorly in <br/>\nalgebra II and I&#39;ve watched him continue to &quot;not care&quot; in two other classes that he chose to <br/>\ntake this year. To my surprise, my feelings about him were impacted by his school <br/>\nperformance which I had assumed would be stellar, in the tradition of all those <br/>\npropaganda articles that homeschoolers put out. :) I took his lack of success there as a <br/>\nreflection on both me as his teacher and on him as a learner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, he&#39;s taught himself to play electric guitar without ever taking a lesson (showed <br/>\nus how to go up and down the scales in finger picking at top speed last night), he&#39;s <br/>\nlearned two computer languages well enough to play around with them and create <br/>\nprograms, he plays X Box round the clock, dislikes inane TV but watches loads of movies, <br/>\nreads classics and science magazines, is learning Klingon and bought four books with his <br/>\nown money to learn it... And more. He is a sponge when he has the time and space to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet I still find myself &quot;disappointed&quot; when his grades aren&#39;t &quot;high&quot; in those couple of <br/>\nschool classes he chose to take. Horrid! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently sat down with him and he shared just what he wants from life and how he&#39;d <br/>\nprefer to spend his time.  He dropped a class, quit his job, quit the sport&#39;s team he&#39;s on <br/>\nand promptly looked up job requirements for game programming. Then he borrowed a <br/>\nC++ programming book from his computer teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s odd, but in our attempts to &quot;prepare&quot; him for real life, real life got left out.

Our unschooling odyssey began with Yu-Gi-Oh cards. My then 8 yo <br/>\nson loved them and the show too. I asked him to teach me how to play (I so didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nlearn) and got confused immediately. He did too. So I took out the playbook and learned <br/>\nwith him. Do you know the game became fun, even for me? I mean, I won&#39;t go out and play <br/>\non my own, but I suddenly saw the genius of this game and why it&#39;s compelling to my son, <br/>\nwhich in turn helped me to understand  him better (and who he is and why this stuff <br/>\nfascinates him and how it stimulates his imagination...) I also discovered that the math <br/>\nbook we had been using just a month prior was waaaay under his ability. I just hadn&#39;t <br/>\nknown because I had never seen him using math in context. He was adding and <br/>\nsubtracting complex four digit numbes in his head (at 8) when I thought he had to learn <br/>\nhow to carry or borrow in two digit operations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most important shifts in my attitude toward unschool came when I took <br/>\nSandra&#39;s advice - spend all day with your kids doing what they&#39;re doing. I did this for <br/>\nmonths and it made all the difference in the world. I stopped worrying about what they <br/>\nwere learning because I got to know them as they are and saw learning in all its variety.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Learning to see differently","postDate":"1077387912","msgId":91249,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjEwMWMzZjhhOCQwYmE1OTEyMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGQ3LjNlNTMzM2MuMmQ2ODE5OWJAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDAwMmYwMWMzZjgyNCQyZjU4ZGQ5MCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPiA8QkFZNS1EQVYyMW9tUlhmMkxUcjAwMDAwNTU3QGhvdG1haWwuY29tPiA8MDAyMTAxYzNmODg0JGY5MTk2YjMwJDY1MDFhOGMwQGpnazY5MDA+"},"prevInTopic":91246,"nextInTopic":91252,"prevInTime":91248,"nextInTime":91250,"topicId":91221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-872742127\">&lt;&lt; Wendy wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I am still not to this point.

It isn&#39;t any longer, but if it still was, it would be no big<br/>\ndeal. He enjoyed it so much and got so much out of it, how could I possibly<br/>\nobject to him enjoying and having fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nHis memory with that game was astounding to me. I couldn&#39;t believe how he<br/>\nknew all the stats on each card. Just from looking at the picture or hearing<br/>\nthe name of the card, he could recite everything on the card. He watched the<br/>\nshow, collected the cards, played the game at home and with friends, taught<br/>\nthe game and went to a gaming store to play and trade. He still plays every<br/>\nonce in awhile but not like he did before. I too had no interest in YuGiOh<br/>\nitself. I couldn&#39;t get the hang of it and couldn&#39;t see the fascination. That<br/>\ndidn&#39;t stop me from listening to him in regard to the game and the cards. It<br/>\ndidn&#39;t stop me from driving him all over looking for cards, setting up days<br/>\nso he could play the game with friends and  from taking him to the gaming<br/>\nstore when he wanted. Those were things that were very important to him, for<br/>\nreasons I didn&#39;t understand, but still important to me that he was doing<br/>\nwhat he loved. I was totally taken aback when I went with him for the first<br/>\ntime to the gaming store. His dad took him before. So here&#39;s my quiet little<br/>\n7 year old boy walking into the gaming store with more confidence than I<br/>\nhad. He went up to kids he never met before, some as old as 19 and 20, and<br/>\nasked to trade or play the game. Wow!!!! Whatever he was getting out of this<br/>\ngame was certainly influencing him in a good way. I let him run with it,<br/>\njust like I do when he gets into anything else that peaks his interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 9 now and off into other directions.

To me, learning to see differently really has been (and still is) a wonderful, personal journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first big step was to let go of my own ideas about what learning looked like (take off my &quot;schoolish&quot; glasses) and be with my kids.  Watching them, playing with them, taking them places we didn&#39;t have time to visit when they were in school, just slowing down and letting them get their fill of what they enjoyed.  This is definitely the deschooling phase, and I definitely had the most deschooling to do.  It involved a lot of thinking, a lot of intense questioning of myself to try to get to the root of what I really wanted to give my kids.  And the really fun part, being with them and seeing just how much they were learning pursuing their own interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids had some deschooling of their to get through too, some school-inspired intense dislikes: my eldest son (he was almost 10 when he came home) to writing and it was a year I think before he even picked up a pen or pencil; and my daughter (she was almost 8) to reading, which she only came to recently.  My youngest was only in school half-day for a few months so he didn&#39;t have much to &quot;recover&quot; from, other than the schedule. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been almost two years now and I&#39;m pretty confident that we are now easing out of the deschooling phase into &quot;real&quot; unschooling - the next phase of the journey.  I see learning in everything they do!  I no longer see some learning (topics or &quot;schoolish&quot; bent) as &quot;more valuable&quot; than others.  I&#39;ve been keeping a journal on and off (on right now) and I have exciting things to write in it every day ... and I know our days are typical ... I just see things so differently now!  I don&#39;t write things in schoolish terms, just in terms of the activities of living a joyful life, but boy does the learning jump out at me (and I think to the small circle of family to which I send it to help them better understand what we do).  In this phase though we&#39;re pretty much actively avoiding anything that looks academic.  Not consciously as in that&#39;s schoolish so we can&#39;t do it, but as in anything with an obvious (and even not so obvious) teacher/student setup is not interesting to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNor frankly, is it something I wish them to do.  I want them to completely break free of the idea that if they want to learn something they should just find a &quot;teacher&quot;, open up, and let them pour their &quot;knowledge&quot; in.  I want them to actively experience learning as the pursuit of knowledge on any topic ... from books, the internet, experiencing it, meeting other people who enjoy the topic, mentors and so on.  To enjoy the connections they find between seemingly unrelated bits of information.  To learn that &quot;teachers&quot; are not the only source of information out there, just one of many.  So right now, when someone expresses an interest in something, &quot;let&#39;s find a teacher&quot; is definitely not my first reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we will eventually get to the &quot;experienced unschoolers&quot; phase, where I imagine my first thoughts when I see my kids enjoying an activity won&#39;t be &quot;wow, look how much they&#39;re learning!&quot;; my mind will go directly to the thought that they&#39;re enjoying what they&#39;re doing.  Where the idea of an &quot;academic&quot; situation won&#39;t seem completely unappealing to my kids - they will see it as another option to dabble in while pursuing their interests.  And where I will be able to detach myself from the whole punishment / reward system built into school and just enjoy seeing them get what they want out of any academic situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not there yet, but I&#39;m really enjoying the journey!<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7143857,"authorName":"jrossedd@aol.com","from":"jrossedd@...","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Learning to see differently","postDate":"1077374966","msgId":91239,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4LjNiNWYzYmZkLjJkNjhjOWY2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":91237,"nextInTopic":91240,"prevInTime":91238,"nextInTime":91240,"topicId":91221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I envy you! Ive had my son out of school since Sept, and everyday when he is playing his game boy, or thumbing through his huge stack of Yu-gi-yo cards, I wonder when he will ever learn anything! It just seems that&#39;s all he wants to do. That&#39;s all he talks about. Yu-Gi-Yo Cards.... And he doesn&#39;t know how to play the game, and I am so not interested in trying to teach the game. Those games are hard even for me to understand. <br/>\n  I am ready for his Obsession with these cards to be gone. He&#39;s always been a little OCD about things he likes. <br/>\n  But really when I look at it from another point of view...he reads the cards, counts up and subtracts the life points and attack points they have ect... but still, Id rather him not be sooooo obsessed. He has woke me up at night just to tell me about a card!<br/>\n  ==================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the main reasons why I think it is easier to unschool from the beginning and why I feel so lucky to have come to it this early (kids 6, 5 and 3). I&#39;ve learned to see the value in everything my kids do because I&#39;ve always been with them, participating in their lives and listening to their passions.  I&#39;ve seen how much they learn without school every day since they were born, so there is no rational reason to send them into some artificially constructed learning place. I trust my children and *know* how capable they are, so it really doesn&#39;t matter to me if they learn something on someone else&#39;s timetable, for someone else&#39;s reasons. I *know* that they will be perfectly capable of learning it if and when they decide they want/need to based on intrinsic motivation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what is so hard for people to grasp. My mother keeps asking me about Emily&#39;s (6) reading. The other day I finally said to her, &quot;Em reads when she&#39;s interested in reading. She&#39;s not going to be 50 and still not reading,&quot; to which my mother responded, &quot;I&#39;m afraid she might be.&quot; I just told her that I wasn&#39;t the least bit concerned about Emily&#39;s ability to read, what I am concerned about is teaching her to hate reading, and that is about the only thing I could *teach* her right now about reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve recently broken away from an online parents group that I&#39;ve been with since I was pregnant with Emily. The space was becoming very oppressive to me with all the discussion of academics, intervention, comparison, etc. I&#39;m finding that I need to separate myself from the school mentality because I feel it&#39;s so destructive. I don&#39;t want to get caught up in the whole comparison game. I said as much and started a firestorm. Reading this list and the unschooling.com message boards is incredibly helpful. I&#39;m trying to *surround* myself with people who are supportive of the way we live our lives instead of those who constantly judge it, which goes a long way to quiet any nagging voices in the back of my mind. It&#39;s a whole lot easier to focus on my children, who they are as whole beings, when I&#39;m not surrounded by folks who are constantly comparing and worrying about their children&#39;s academic progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to suggest replacing &quot;obsession&quot; in your mind with &quot;passion.&quot; When I am passionately learning about something, which is exactly how I tend to learn things, it looks &quot;obsessive&quot; to some other point of view. When I started gardening, I passionately read about it, poured over beautiful pictures in magazines and  landscaping books, wrote and drew daily in my garden journal, designing and redesigning all the things I wanted to do. I *loved* doing it, and that&#39;s what I wanted to do and think about whenever I could. I can&#39;t imagine someone coming and telling me how stupid and obsessive I was being over something as ridiculous as a plant. In the aftermath of 9/11/01 (my dh works on a naval base next to an AFB in DC, my sil works in NYC and her then-husband worked and was in the Trade Center that day, so it hit pretty close), gardening was my outlet and my therapy. It gave me peace and made me feel like I was doing something to make the world beautiful. What if someone told me how stupid that was? It would have completely negated a very important part of me, of who I was at that moment and what I needed to be doing.  I learned so much by following my passion, it healed my soul and I made a small part of the world a more beautiful and hospitable place. Parts of my yard are sanctuaries for me, my kids, friends, birds, butterflies, caterpillars, frogs and loads of other wildlife. And, my kids have learned a ton from exposure to my passion. Open yourself up, and I&#39;m betting that you could learn something by embracing your son&#39;s passion, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175898140,"authorName":"Marti","from":"Marti &lt;marti@...&gt;","profile":"nestmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Learning to see differently","postDate":"1077372739","msgId":91236,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4zLjAuMC4yMDA0MDIyMTA5MDI1Mi4wMWI1N2VjMEAxMjcuMC4wLjE+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwMjIxMTM1MjM0LkRFMjc5MjJFQ0VAd3MxLTgudXM0Lm91dGJsYXplLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwMjIxMTM1MjM0LkRFMjc5MjJFQ0VAd3MxLTgudXM0Lm91dGJsYXplLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":91235,"nextInTopic":91237,"prevInTime":91235,"nextInTime":91237,"topicId":91221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The problem is, he&#39;s already there, he&#39;s just waiting for you to catch up!  You&#39;re the one that&#39;s behind.  He&#39;s doing the learning, he&#39;s moved on, and you&#39;re still stuck on the same chapter.  It&#39;s time to turn the page.

Would you be interested in teaching him geography?  Biology?  Seismology?  Are those the important things?  Your things are important and his things are crap?  If that&#39;s true, I don&#39;t blame him for not being interested in your stuff.  Why should he get excited about your stuff when you look at his stuff with disdain and revulsion?  Don&#39;t forget that he&#39;s learning something about the signals you&#39;re sending him too.  He&#39;s learning ALL the time.  Don&#39;t let him learn that his mom thinks what he does is stupid.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Those games are hard even for me to understand.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s your attitude that makes it hard.  I&#39;m a duelist.  I&#39;ve got my own deck.  We have a blast dueling at our house.  Yes, it took me a while to learn, and I can rarely ever beat Dylan, but I have a lot of fun playing.  The &quot;hard&quot; was worth it.  If you&#39;re not willing to put out the effort to learn something that&#39;s hard for you, how can you ever expect your son to?  Model the attitude you would like him to follow.  Right now he&#39;s modeling it for you.  He wants to learn something hard, help him do it.  If you can&#39;t do it, find someone that can.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am ready for his Obsession with these cards to be gone.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He&#39;s learning about the cards.  He wants to learn to duel.  He&#39;s found something that fascinates him, and has a deep passion for, and you don&#39;t want to help.  I think you&#39;re the one with the obsession.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We all went to the SC Aquarium over Valentines Weekend!&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Learned a lot about Fish and Water, and wildlife.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool!  Sounds great!  And when you can show the same excitement about every other thing he does, you will be officially deschooled!  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re still looking for the learning, and I know that&#39;s a tough habit to get out of.  But, you can do it, with a lot of conscious effort on your part.  Going to the aquarium is not better than dueling or playing a GameBoy.  Different, but not better.  I&#39;ll bet that the kids he knows talk more about dueling or video games than they do about fish and wildlife.  He&#39;s in touch with what goes on around him, the people he knows and the things that they do.  Including you.  He enjoys Yu-Gi-Oh AND the aquarium.

My kids maybe could be said to have <br/>\n&quot;dabbled&quot; in college. And that&#39;s usually considered a negative. But <br/>\nthat&#39;s the closest I can come to describing how they view their <br/>\nclasses. And they would be the FIRST to tell you that the classes were <br/>\nnice, but that they were just a little &quot;extra&quot; - not the basis of their <br/>\neducation/learning. They view the classes as just another item on the <br/>\nHUGE menu of options. They don&#39;t view the classes as &quot;where they learn&quot; <br/>\nor at least no more so than the other ways they learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know  - I agree with Sandra wholeheartedly on this, but also <br/>\nfind it difficult to articulate. I just want people new to unschooling <br/>\nto try to understand that we did first leave all &quot;teacher-directed&quot; <br/>\ntype of schooling entirely behind for many years before my kids started <br/>\ntaking classes. Now they view the teacher as a resource person and <br/>\nthemselves as responsible for their own learning. It is VERY different <br/>\nthan most of my students who think that I, as their teacher, run the <br/>\nshow. My teens are running their own show, they are the directors, and <br/>\nthe teachers of any classes they take are thought of more as useful <br/>\ntechnicians.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Learning to see differently","postDate":"1077344076","msgId":91232,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjNS4xNGNkMTFhZi4yZDY4NTE0Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91230,"nextInTopic":91233,"prevInTime":91231,"nextInTime":91233,"topicId":91221,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/20/04 11:05:03 PM, WendyWCarr@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-308963541\">In a message dated 2/20/04 11:05:03 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:WendyWCarr@...\">WendyWCarr@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; when he is playing his game boy, or thumbing through his huge stack of <br/>\nYu-gi-yo cards, I wonder when he will ever learn anything! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen will you learn to see the value in video games and collectible card <br/>\ngames?<br/>\nSeriously.

If you turn away from the academics and truly, really, calmly <br/>\nand fully believe that there is a world that doesn&#39;t revolve around or even <br/>\nrequire or even benefit from academic traditions, *then* after a while you can see <br/>\nacademics (research into education, or classes, or college) from another <br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce there was heavy fog at our house.  Kirby was four or five.  He had never <br/>\nseen it at all, and this was as thick as I have ever seen fog.   He wanted to <br/>\ngo and touch it.  I yelled &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; and we ran up the road, and ran, and <br/>\nran.   About seven houses up we got tired, and I said &quot;Look&quot; and pointed back <br/>\ntoward our house, which was gone in the fog.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did NOT say &quot;See?

He learned by running in fog and smelling it, <br/>\nand losing his house in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor someone who has been out of and away from school for six months to take a <br/>\nclass will not be the same experience as someone (child or parent) who has <br/>\nbeen out and away for eight or ten years.   It will be different in very, very <br/>\nprofound ways.  And &quot;profound&quot; doesn&#39;t show from the house.  You have to run <br/>\nuntil you can&#39;t see the house, and then profundity kicks in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone who understands what I&#39;m saying can think of another way to say it, <br/>\nhelp would be great.
