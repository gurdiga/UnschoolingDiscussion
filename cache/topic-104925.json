My 3 kids have been out of <br/>\nschool for 4 years (the best 4 years of my life) and I have been <br/>\ntrying to create a positive unschooling life for the entire 4 <br/>\nyears.  I&#39;ve come to believe that unschooling is an extension of a <br/>\ncompletely positive parenting style, so I&#39;ve shifted my parenting <br/>\nstyle to a much healthier place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my son Ben has insisted that he wants to take the SAT test and <br/>\ngo to a 4 year university for film making and writing.(I do not want <br/>\nhim to take the SAT).  We discussed this at length - the pro&#39;s and <br/>\ncon&#39;s  and ways that he can get into a college without the SAT- and <br/>\nhe made the final decision that he wants to take the SAT and that he <br/>\nneeds the SAT prep class.  I really believe that he got caught up in <br/>\nthe hype with some of his friends who are preparing to take the <br/>\nSAT&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I signed him up for the SAT prep class (at the local high school)<br/>\nfor a fee of $250.  I also signed him up for a creative writing <br/>\nclass that he REALLY wanted to take at the local adult ed. center, <br/>\nfor a fee of $39.  He got home from the 1st SAT prep class and he <br/>\nwas totally disgusted with it.  He was in a state of shock at the <br/>\nway he was treated, and he was reminded of all the reasons that he <br/>\nleft school.  He hates the class and doesn&#39;t want to go back!  In <br/>\ncontrast, he went to the first writing class and was treated as an <br/>\nequal, published authors were talking to him as though his <br/>\nconversation was important.  Ben is to call the instructor by his <br/>\nfirst name (this was very important to Ben for some reason).  Well, <br/>\nhe is so inspired, that he is again writing every day, he is <br/>\ndeveloping ideas etc..  He really wants his future to be filled with <br/>\nwriting books and making films.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dilema is that I spent $250 of not so easy to come by cash.  My <br/>\nhusband is opposed to letting him drop the class, because of the <br/>\nmoney issue and that we advised him against taking the class to <br/>\nbegin with.
