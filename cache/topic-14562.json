Because I feel it is important for my kids to learn<br/>\nthings or change at the point in their lives when they are ready to do so.<br/>\nThis applies as much to child-led weaning as it does to child-led learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think you<br/>\n&gt; folks would agree that a 4 or 5 year old with a bottle would be a bit<br/>\n&gt; ridiculous!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why?? Only because society does not accept that the needs of these children<br/>\nare valid? Every society, every culture has different norms and values. I<br/>\ncertainly do *not* accept that our culture&#39;s norm of forcing independence on<br/>\nchildren before they are ready (forcing them to wean early, sleep through<br/>\nthe night without comfort, etc.) are valid. In the same vein, I do not<br/>\naccept that our culture&#39;s norm of forcing children to all learn the same<br/>\nthing at the same time is valid. Allowing my children to take their own<br/>\nsteps toward independence from me is part and parcel of unschooling, whether<br/>\nthat independence be weaning from the breast or going off to their first<br/>\njob.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What is the difference with the breast?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmmm, now *that* could take up an entire digest in itself :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;       Please inform me now if this list goes off-topic habitually.
