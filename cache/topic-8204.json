There s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1094223500\">Commenting on the thread of the &#39;shy&#39; child.  I personally don&#39;t like the <br/>\nterm &#39;shy&#39;.  In my experience, a &#39;shy&#39; person is generally an introvert.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing wrong with being an introvert.  But it can be important for <br/>\nintroverts to learn the skills that allow comfortable social interactions, <br/>\njust as it can be important for extroverts to learn skills to allow them to <br/>\nbe comfortable by themselves or in very small groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the term &#39;shy&#39; because there&#39;s a sense of there being something <br/>\nwrong with the child, when the only thing wrong is assuming all people should <br/>\nbe equally comfortable with strangers and large groups.  OTOH, if I think of <br/>\n&#39;skills&#39; rather than &#39;something&#39;s wrong with the child&#39;, then I can focus on <br/>\neasy ways to learn those skills, rather than forcing my child to act <br/>\nextroverted when in fact she&#39;s an introvert.  My focus would be in helping <br/>\nher feel confident rather than making her fit someone else&#39;s definition of <br/>\nextroverted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hjshaltz@...\">hjshaltz@...</a><br/>\nHJS Studio and Shaltz Farm Shetlands and Angora Rabbits<br/>\nList Mom, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberFlock@onelist.com\">FiberFlock@onelist.com</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FiberProfessionals@onelist.com\">FiberProfessionals@onelist.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8188,"nextTopicId":8205}}
