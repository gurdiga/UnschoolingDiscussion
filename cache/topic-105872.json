She <br/>\nmisspelled a few other things, and was funky with capitalization, but it was  an <br/>\ne-mail to her mom in the middle of the night so no biggie.

No e-mail.  That happened once  before, <br/>\nwhen he stayed where the internet connection was down.  He was  young then, he&#39;s <br/>\n18 now, and I wasn&#39;t worried.  He called at noon,  apologizing.  I asked if <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t have e-mail, and he said he fell  asleep without realizing it and <br/>\nhad just woken up. New gaming friends, from a  gaming shop other than the one he <br/>\nworked in for so long, and they&#39;re not on this  side of town.  <br/>\nUnderstandable, as they played until the shop closed and  went to a house to play some more. <br/>\n Sober and geeky and not in  danger.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105869,"nextTopicId":105816}}
