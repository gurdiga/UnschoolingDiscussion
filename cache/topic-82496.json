Not unlike <br/>\nsand, the kids (11, 9 and 7) were mesmerized. We scooped, <br/>\npoured them from one container to another and counted them. <br/>\nWe figured out how many lentils are in a one pound bag: 6, 600.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat got us wondering how many lentils it would take to make a <br/>\nstraight line from Los Angeles CA to New York City NY. We <br/>\nbegan measuring one inch, then multiplied it by twelve inches for <br/>\na foot. Then we figured out how many feet in a mile and THEN, <br/>\nwe figured out how many miles (using mapquest) between LA <br/>\nand NYC (we used our rounding skills and rounded that number <br/>\nto 2800).<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you know that it would take 887, 040, 000 to make a straight <br/>\nline from LA to NYC? When we guessed before we began, we <br/>\nhad these guesses: 87 billion, 50 billion, and 11 billion. We were <br/>\nnowhere close. I would *never* have guessed that you could put <br/>\nlentils end to end next to each other and get from LA to NYC <br/>\nwithout going past 1 billion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat made me suddenly acutely aware of just how big a billion <br/>\ndollars is (imagine housing one billion dollar bills, for instance, if  <br/>\nless than a billion tiny lentils end to end will cross the USA). I <br/>\nbegan to understand the nature of the huge deficit CA is facing <br/>\nand the nation is spending on the war etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never really got &quot;one billion&quot; until today. And we had fun. And <br/>\nsuddenly I enjoyed a moment of math!
