Our<br/>\nneighbor friend back in Pensacola (schooled) asked us what the tallest<br/>\nwaterfall in the world was. I guessed Angel Falls and when we looked<br/>\nit up, it WAS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then, we took some big paper and I drew Angel Falls height (I think<br/>\nwe used 1&quot;=10 feet or something) and compared it to Niagara (which she<br/>\nthought was the tallest, but is actually highest volume).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then they wanted to know how some buildings compared, so we added<br/>\nthe Empire State building, the Sears tower and some building in Japan.<br/>\nBy then, we had no room left on the paper, so we took the measuring<br/>\ntape and laid it out on the sidewalk. They were flipping out!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur little friend said &quot;NOW I see how learning can be fun!!!&quot;<br/>\nShe has vowed to homeschool her own children. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":11046692,"authorName":"sahm2cody","from":"&quot;sahm2cody&quot; &lt;CXFiles@...&gt;","profile":"sahm2cody","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: today&#39;s questions","postDate":"1139889475","msgId":112037,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRzcmtnMytkZm12QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":112043,"prevInTime":112036,"nextInTime":112038,"topicId":112037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love the idea of a question notebook!
