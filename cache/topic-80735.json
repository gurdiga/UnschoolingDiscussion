I am normally a reserved personal person esp with my body. With <br/>\nmy first I was a wreck nursing in public but with my last two I have been much <br/>\nmore relaxed. <br/>\nI nursed with my sling every where. The mall, dinner, holidays with family, <br/>\ngrocery shopping, outings, church (where it was well accepted even without a <br/>\nsling) and others. I dont recall not feeling comfortable to nurse anywhere.  The <br/>\nslings are big enough with an infant that you are totally covered as is the <br/>\nbaby.  <br/>\nI have never made it past 7-8mo in my nursing so I have no clue what it is <br/>\nlike to nurse a toddler as that would be out of the sling, bigger and much more <br/>\nobvious.  But getting to the 8 mo mark and knowing and wishing I had gone <br/>\nlonger I plan to with this next baby/s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura <br/>\n7 weeks preg<br/>\nWho cant figure out why I have gained 8-10 pounds in 2 weeks! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I used a sling for both children and nursed comfortably in a sling.  I <br/>\nhave <br/>\nnursed a single child on airplanes and even tandem nursed on airplanes (no <br/>\nway <br/>\nto be discreet with that).  I nursed my children during both my mother&#39;s and <br/>\nfather&#39;s funerals, yes in the front row.  Nursed while sitting on a street <br/>\nbench in the city. On buses and on subways.  My oldest nursed in public until <br/>\nhe <br/>\nwas about 4ish then his nursing slowed to only before bed. I have nursed my <br/>\nchildren just about everywhere and have never had a negative comment.  Never <br/>\n&quot;covered up&quot; with a cloth. Maybe my experience is unique but I have never had <br/>\nanyone run away from me or say anything but positive comments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] breastfeeding was: more clarifying","postDate":"1063801897","msgId":80735,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdlLjNlMmM4ZGY1LjJjOTlhZTI5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":80738,"prevInTime":80734,"nextInTime":80736,"topicId":80735,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/16/03 11:27:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time, HMSL2@aol.com ...
