Up here a family<br/>\nwas taking advantage of the BOGGs (Board of Govenors&#39; Grants, which pays for<br/>\nunits) and enrolling 6 year olds, etc.  The children were not &quot;taking&quot; the<br/>\nclasses and were disruptive.  So now, compliments of this family, the kids<br/>\ncan&#39;t take classes before they are 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the jr. college where I use to work, there was no minimum age but kids<br/>\nunder high school age had to be interviewed.  We had some kids as young as<br/>\n10 taking classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Sarah Carothers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, November 26, 2001 2:21 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:new subject!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Do any of you have experience with your older children attending local<br/>\ncommunity colleges?
