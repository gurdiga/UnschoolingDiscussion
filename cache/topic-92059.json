It took me a long<br/>\ntime to &quot;come out&quot; as an unschooler because I feared they would not welcome<br/>\nJayn to play. That has turned out to be groundless. I simply walk away from<br/>\nthe curriculum conversations, and now it seems there are two other<br/>\nunschooling families in the group (I may be the only Radical Unschooler). It<br/>\nis the almost universal focus on gentler parenting that keeps me in the<br/>\ngroup, especially amongst the longer term members. I don&#39;t proselytize<br/>\nunschooling, but do answer questions when asked. If someone talks about how<br/>\nthey &quot;do&quot; x pages or hours or starts complaining about the time it takes, I<br/>\njust go away. Sometimes I just say &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m an unschooler so I<br/>\ndon&#39;t use any curriculum.&quot; <br/>\nMy point is that we are in the group for Jayn&#39;s sake, not mine - having<br/>\nother gently parented children to play with in a non-judgmental free-play<br/>\nsituation without the excessive parental mediation in their activities and<br/>\ninteractions that so characterizes ordinary park visit experiences. I have<br/>\nmade some friends that we see outside of the group too. I sometimes feel<br/>\nlike they look upon me with humor - as if I was the local harmless eccentric<br/>\ncrackpot.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Also, I am needing advice on what to tell my 12 yo<br/>\n(Suzi). Suzi&#39;s best friend comes over everyday<br/>\n(instead of being a latchkey kid) and frequently says<br/>\nthings to Suzi such as &quot;you&#39;re not going to learn<br/>\nanything&quot;, &quot;you should go back to school&quot;, &quot;how are<br/>\nyou ever going to get into college/scholarships etc&quot;,<br/>\nand &quot;you&#39;re going to be dumb&quot;. I try to reassure Suzi<br/>\nthat she will learn as much as or more (though not in<br/>\nthe same order) as the kids in school and we have had<br/>\ntalks about what she wants (doesn&#39;t want to go back to<br/>\nschool, doesn&#39;t want to stick her nose in a book all<br/>\nday).

It sounds clear to me that she is already<br/>\nfeeling jealous on several levels, and finding it hard to adjust to a major<br/>\nchange in her circumstances. The balance of power at school is no doubt<br/>\naltered without Suzi, and the friend is speaking from her needs, not Suzi&#39;s<br/>\nbest interest. No one needs to have &quot;friends&quot; who see it as their job to<br/>\npull you down, criticize you and hurt your feelings. I think saying personal<br/>\ndisparagments like &quot;you&#39;re going to be dumb&quot; crosses a line, beyond<br/>\nexpressing doubts about colleges - the latter can be easily refuted with<br/>\ninformation, which may reassure Suzi. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not above using the fact that other children are rule-bound and<br/>\nbrainwashed by saying something along the lines of &quot;respecting the house<br/>\nrules&quot; - even though we don&#39;t actually have any! We had to speak to Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nfriend about not trying to draw Jayn into schemes to hide candy, and I have<br/>\ntold her to change her blackmailing type behavior or go home in the past<br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzi is still deschooling. She is having to change from a peer dominated<br/>\nreality fraught with manipulations, to a family centered one. My immediate<br/>\nknee jerk reaction would be to find ways to lessen the time the other girl<br/>\nis spending with her for now - by going on interesting outings so you aren&#39;t<br/>\nhome in the afternoon, for example. It should not be your responsibility to<br/>\ncare for her (as a latchkey kid as you mention) if it is detrimental to your<br/>\nown daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, there are several other families unschooling Asperger&#39;s and Autism<br/>\nspectrum children.
