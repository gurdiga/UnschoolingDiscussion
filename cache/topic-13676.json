I was a<br/>\nstrep carrier - so, once we tackled these two things - she never had an ear<br/>\ninfection again until I tried dairy about 12 months later.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, she is now 5 and can handle dairy in her diet (no, she does<br/>\nnot drink cows milk or eat ice cream) - but limited dairy does not affect<br/>\nher anymore.  My friend had told me that she had read somewhere that kids,<br/>\nif they show early signs of dairy allergies, once the product is removed and<br/>\nslowly introduced, by age 5 they have usually grown out of the problem.  So<br/>\nfar, this seems to be the case for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we too began calling ourselves unschoolers when Dana was 22mos.  Folks<br/>\nwould look at us funny, and other people on other lists chastised me for<br/>\n&quot;labelling&quot; her that - but we did anyway and we still do - and we are all<br/>\nthe better for it.  Had I not given myself permission to &quot;wander&quot;, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink I would have become the person I am today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nkaren mowery</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13673,"nextTopicId":13678}}
