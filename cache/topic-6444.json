After he became diabetic, I looked at what he had been eating all<br/>\nhis life (canned food or dry food) and thought, how would I do on a diet<br/>\nof only canned or dry food? (Answer -- I&#39;d be sick, too!)  I found a book<br/>\nby Anitra Frazier &quot;The New Natural Cat&quot; and she has recipes for a good cat<br/>\ndiet, plus recipes for your cat if he or she has certain illnesses.  The<br/>\ndiets usually involve throwing raw meat with rice or oatmeal and broccoli<br/>\ninto a blender a few times a week, but for us, its been worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nWini<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________<br/>\nWINIFRED HAUN & DANCERS<br/>\n4225 N.
