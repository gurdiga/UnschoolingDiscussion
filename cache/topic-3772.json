For us,  the<br/>\npast two years have been so challenging for ME.  During my pregnancy with my<br/>\nthird child,  I was really struggling with some work issues and feeling<br/>\nphysically extremely exhausted all the time.  We finally decided I needed to<br/>\nput my part time career behind me for awhile and I&#39;d be SAHM.  Well,<br/>\nquitting was quite and adjustment for me...I had loved my job.   When the<br/>\nbaby arrived.....things were rough.  She was jauncide for a month and a poor<br/>\nlatcher/nurser ...so no sleep for mom.  We struggled for several months.  I<br/>\ntried to begin exercising,  but it was literally painful to even walk.   I<br/>\nfinally decided to see the doctor and made an appt.  The day of the appt,  I<br/>\nnoticed while getting ready,  that my eyeballs were yellow!! And my urine<br/>\ndiscolored.  The only people I had ever seen jaundiced were hospice patients<br/>\nwith liver failure.  The Dr. suspected hepatitis C,  took blood work,  and<br/>\nrequested an ultrasound to check gall bladder.   I never made it until the<br/>\nultrasound test.....the day after seeing the doctor I awakened in the night<br/>\nwith extreme pain and vomiting.  Turns out I had acute pancreatitis due to<br/>\ngallstones in the bile duct.<br/>\n    To try and make a long story short.....I have really had to struggle<br/>\nwith healing while trying to manage our home and family (three youngsters).<br/>\n    Finding ways to get my healing/nurturing needs met and trying to be<br/>\nthere for my husband to nurture him .... and the children.

About 2 weeks after he came <br/>\nhome,  I was hospitalized and ended up having my gall bladder removed <br/>\nthe old fashioned way. (I&#39;ve read that this is the most common dual <br/>\nhospitalization - pregnancy followed by gall bladder surgery).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDh helped as much as he could,  but he had <br/>\nused his vacation when ds was sick and in the hospital.  My older <br/>\nchild was in Kindergarten and really was helpful,  but I felt like <br/>\nshe was being ignored.  I ended up having wonderful friends that <br/>\nhelped by having her over to play, etc.  Also,  we flew my mil out <br/>\nfor two weeks to help with the baby.  It was an unbelievable time, <br/>\nbut a lot of good came out of it.  Mil and ds bonded like they never <br/>\nwould have had she been 500 miles away.  They&#39;re close to this day, <br/>\neven now that he&#39;s 13 and she&#39;s 800 miles away.  Also,  we really <br/>\nlearned to prioritize.  It&#39;s so easy when things are running smoothly <br/>\nto let the details get in the way.  I believe that stressful times <br/>\nlike this help me realize what&#39;s really important.  I know that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help you much  right now.  Just,  do what you have to and everything <br/>\nelse will fall into place.
