We were driving<br/>\ndown the road one day and say a dog chained inside this little open fronted<br/>\nshed.  She was about 9 months old.  She had exactly enough length of chain<br/>\nto sit down but not lay down.  Her neck was a mess, not only raw but the<br/>\nbugs had been visiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe &quot;bought&quot; her and took her home and took care of her injuries.  However,<br/>\nfor the rest of her life if you pulled on her neck she would snap.  this was<br/>\na reflex.  She would let go as soon as she realised that she had hold of a<br/>\nhuman body that wasn&#39;t trying to hurt her.  She never broke the skin but she<br/>\nbit a whole bunch of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe eventually gave her to a woman that raised sheep that the coyotes had<br/>\nbeen getting too and Just Plain Kate became a sheep guardian, which she was<br/>\nvery good at!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son (6 at the time) was more hysterical over giving her away than when<br/>\nshe bit him.  And he was hysterical then because he thought she would get in<br/>\ntrouble, not because she bit him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just really depends on the dog and how/why they bite.  It also always<br/>\namazed me that no matter how many times we explained to folks that they<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t pull on her collar or leash, they always did it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Julie Stauffer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 26, 2001 2:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1548<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I still wouldn&#39;t let my child play with a dog that has a tendency to<br/>\n&gt; bite&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it depends on the dog, the kid, and the circumstances.
