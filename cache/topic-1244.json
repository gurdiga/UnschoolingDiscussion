The female was<br/>\ndepositing eggs on a<br/>\nleaf, while the male was fertilizing them as they<br/>\ncame out (or so it<br/>\nappeared without a magnifying glass).  Anyway, Zac<br/>\nhad removed the leaf<br/>\nfrom the tree it was growing on, so we then decided<br/>\nto place it gently<br/>\nin our flower garden.  After a short while, both<br/>\nladybugs flew away.<br/>\nNow the leaf is turning brown, but the eggs are<br/>\nstill on it, looking the<br/>\nsame.  We&#39;re hoping they &quot;do their thing&quot; and hatch,<br/>\nor whatever is<br/>\nsupposed to happen to them.  It&#39;s pretty amazing the<br/>\nthings you find<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re not even looking, isn&#39;t it?  We were<br/>\njust outside, mowing<br/>\nthe grass and planting the garden.  Nothing too<br/>\nspectacular... then the<br/>\nladybugs and bright yellow spider came our way, and<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been<br/>\n&quot;scientists&quot; ever since!<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte:  Great to &quot;see&quot; you, too!!!!! :-)  We&#39;re<br/>\nhappy and well.<br/>\nThanks for asking!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Monica</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1235,"nextTopicId":1245}}
