She has incredible insight into human nature and the influence of society on the family. This novel is one of her best. From what you write about your understanding of your child, the stress and confusion about your relationship with him and his influence on your family, I believe that this novel could unlock some answers for you. From the little I know of your situation it would appear that this novel could be about you and it certainly reflects the struggles we all encounter as mothers. Her work is a little difficult and a follow up discussion can be very helpful too so if you decide to read it and you want to discuss the ideas I&#39;d be happy to participate. <br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Bridget/Wyndham","postDate":"1007821787","msgId":29657,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDl1dDg0cit2NWtlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwODUwMWMxN2ZiMyQwZTg4YmI4MCQyYzBkOGMxOEBzc3NuZXQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29637,"nextInTopic":29661,"prevInTime":29656,"nextInTime":29658,"topicId":29637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
