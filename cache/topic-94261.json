I&#39;ve known some never said as much, but clearly should never have had &#39;more&#39; children at whatever point.  I think deciding to adopt is much the same -- it&#39;s about knowing your limits and when to say no to the idea of adding a child, whether bio or adopted.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it also has to do with your reasons or needs -- is someone adopting to get the boy or girl they always wanted but never got? That&#39;s such a bad reason to have or adopt another child.  I remember the story my Mom and her sisters tell about the birth of the youngest sister.  Mom&#39;s the oldest of 5 girls, in pursuit of a boy.  When the youngest was due and Grandma went to the hospital for her birth, the other girls asked their Dad if they could go see Mom and the baby at the hospital, he answered &#39;if it&#39;s a boy, we&#39;ll go to see him.  Otherwise, just wait for Mama to come home.&quot;  He ltold the girls he loved them, but was clearly going to be hugely disappointed if (when, actually) the new baby was a girl.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s why it always bothers me when people (complete strangers, mind you) ask if we&#39;re going to try for a girl.
