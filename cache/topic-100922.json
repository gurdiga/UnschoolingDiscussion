It is full of people who can spin a good<br/>\nline to get what they want - they usually become producers or location<br/>\nmanagers. There is a reason why so much of politics seems to be like the<br/>\nentertainment business. Both are founded on manipulating information for<br/>\nemotional response.

They do whatever it takes to make it good, not just for the grade.<br/>\n&quot;Good&quot; means has the possibility of being sellable and/or getting into the<br/>\nbetter festivals. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to remind anyone concerned about the concept of looking boring<br/>\n- documentaries are made in the editing room. Massive amounts are usually<br/>\nshot and the footage is then cut - for effect, for commentary, for humor,<br/>\nfor impact, for controversy, for irony. Just because it is a documentary<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that the fundamentals of filmmaking don&#39;t apply, and 25 minutes<br/>\nis a long time. Rule one: the only thing that holds interest is conflict. If<br/>\nthere is no conflict happening in the story or between the characters, then<br/>\nthere needs to be conflict between the on screen world and the audience&#39;s<br/>\nperceptions and prior understanding, beliefs and expectations. Even the most<br/>\ninnocuous day can be intercut with other days or people to look...different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll give you an entirely hypothetical example. Suppose he has masses of<br/>\nfootage of several families&#39; kids playing video games &quot;all day long&quot;. This<br/>\nis dull on screen. So he interviews someone, some education expert talking<br/>\nabout the &quot;dangers of electronic media&quot;. He can probably find plenty of<br/>\nexperts in his own faculty at UCB. He intercuts between &quot;statements&quot; and the<br/>\nkids playing, and playing. This is starting to look interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK now for some humor...he shows some footage of one of the mothers talking<br/>\nabout the variety of cool things their family does each day. Then he<br/>\nintercuts between that &quot;enthusiasm&quot; and the kids still playing, and playing,<br/>\nand playing video games. OK. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow his documentary needs some serious social commentary. So he interviews<br/>\nsome health person who talks about the growing trend of obesity and<br/>\nunfitness amongst youngsters, or RSI, or eye damage, and then intercuts with<br/>\nthe kids, now with the lights on because night has apparently fallen, still<br/>\nsupposedly playing the video games. Maybe just to cap it off, he shows one<br/>\nkid calling out for some food, and Mom bringing in something, as we often<br/>\nall do. Well that takes care of a good seven minutes of his documentary, and<br/>\nhe is starting to look like an employable director who can generate conflict<br/>\nand insert a point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, I&#39;m a cynic AND paranoid - but I was a student making films for grades<br/>\nonce too. Don&#39;t show him this email - he may get ideas from it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only person I would trust to make a documentary that did not end up<br/>\nmaking unschoolers look like oddballs at best would be another unschooler,<br/>\nlike Cameron Lovejoy for example.
