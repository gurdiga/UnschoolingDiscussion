I have no pearls of wisdom about how to handle your son \nwhen he tantrums except to say that I too have been where you are at and the \nbest advice I can give you is this time will pass and better moments lay \nahead.&nbsp; What I find helps me in those very trying moments is to try to \ngrasp (this can be very difficult at times!) where your son is coming \nfrom.&nbsp; Was his day really stressful and stimulating, was he feeling unwell, \ndid his sheets itch him...and so on.&nbsp; A book that has really helped us is \nthe Out of Sync Child by Carol Kranowitz.&nbsp; If you haven&#39;t read it, it is \nreally a great book for kids like ours.&nbsp; Another great resource has been \nthe Sensory Integration e-group on One List.&nbsp; I have found many great \ninsights and comfort in reading snippets from other people&#39;s lives.&nbsp; \nKnowing that I am not the only one experiencing a child that responds like \nmine&nbsp;has been very helpful.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">W</font><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">ishing you a \npeaceful day tomorrow!</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Tiffany</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Olympia, Washington</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Andi Kaufman","from":"Andi Kaufman &lt;tl2b@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"VrKKU27ki6wL5wzaZIPf6qvdhHfeI5lOkorLiWuDEVoYBXk50yhd5oWkD-1viP5CFON-ge9a-7AO9pX9y19R1kdX95T1hb2jlA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: HELP!!","postDate":"934545745","msgId":1962,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNTAuMTk2Mi45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1948,"nextInTopic":13913,"prevInTime":1961,"nextInTime":1963,"topicId":1948,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"nanci, please foward any info you get. we are in exactly the same position. we have been looking for a child for at least 6 mo probably more and the system is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1895989904\">nanci,<br/>\n<br/>\nplease foward any info you get. we are in exactly the same position. we<br/>\nhave been looking for a child for at least 6 mo probably more and the<br/>\nsystem is so screwed up. but i have researched everything and i am not<br/>\nlooking inot the ADD issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndi...domestic goddess and active volunteer<br/>\n\t  mom to Isaac<br/>\n\t  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tl2b@...\">tl2b@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNever Underestimate the Power of This Woman!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;tn-k4of5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"dXls-tL8SxYRBWWfoNfiV4F4u3FDQympL-ocbuk5XqQugqt9_FOyKQMEmydyqVz1XxmHsdbyXVrkUHPRWw9U6kg2zyc88cm1oh7PTmM33-L-axtNboZQMfs","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: HELP!!","postDate":"934507172","msgId":1948,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNDkuMTk0OC45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1962,"prevInTime":1947,"nextInTime":1949,"topicId":1948,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... while people with ADHD cannot help that they ...

I wanted to put a<br/>\nquestion to you about some of the kids that we have seen in the listings.<br/>\nWe are looking to adopt a girl from foster care between the ages of 3 and<br/>\n9, and we have seen a LOT of ADD or ADHD labeled kids who are being<br/>\n&quot;medicated&quot; for that.  What are some opinions about the probability of many<br/>\nof these children having been misdiagnosed, medicated without need,<br/>\npossibly having emotional issues stemming from foster care or previous<br/>\nproblems that &quot;look&quot; like ADD symptoms, etc.??  How difficult is it to take<br/>\na child off medication?  How would you assess the true nature of a child&#39;s<br/>\ncondition, abilities and needs when they are already on medication?  How do<br/>\nyou approach this issue in a way that is healthy and non-threatening to the<br/>\nchild?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have to be careful about what we do also, as this child will not be<br/>\nconsidered &quot;ours&quot; until the adoption is finalized (possibly up to a year<br/>\nafter they enter our family) and social workers could attempt to block the<br/>\nprocess if they think we are not doing what is in the &quot;best interests of<br/>\nthe child.&quot;  We have to make a decision about which children to persue<br/>\nbased on limited information that is available to the Case Worker, which<br/>\nmay include an ADD diagnosis and the presence of medication.  We can meet a<br/>\nchild, talk with Foster Families, etc, but not without investing time and<br/>\nmoney in traveling to the child&#39;s state/area, so we want to be fairly<br/>\ncertain of the likelihood of a child being a good match for us before that<br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I avoid children who are being medicated as a matter of course?<br/>\nWould the situation be too sticky to embroil ourselves in if there is<br/>\npsychological drugs present?  Anyone have any info to share?  Anyone also<br/>\nhave any leads or suggestions of areas/agencies for us to check into for kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13885,"nextTopicId":13898}}
