At the Brownie meeting, we were making signs for selling cookies. We had a bunch of ribbon, and the girls ended up cutting lengths and putting them in their hair by about halfway through the meeting. Sarah wanted some too, so I put some in after brushing her hair up into a ponytail. <br/>\n<br/>\nSarah has NEVER liked having anything on her head, or hairbows, and only once in awhile will tolerate having her hair up. She was a forceps birth, and it left her with a dislocated jaw and nearly poked her eye out. She would wiggle and wiggle to get out of the little hats they put on newborns in the hospital. Put one on her, and within 10 minutes she&#39;d have it off her head. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust before the meeting ended, Sarah came to me and asked me to take hers out. I jokingly said &quot;Don&#39;t you want to do what everyone else is doing?&quot; and she said said &quot;No, I&#39;m special in my own way and I don&#39;t like having things in my hair or my hair up.&quot; I said &quot;I&#39;m proud of you for not going along with everyone when you don&#39;t really want to!&quot; and I took them out of her hair. <br/>\n<br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not?!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
