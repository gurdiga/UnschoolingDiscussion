What TV shows does she enjoy now?  Watch those <br/>\nwith her and see if you can find shows/videos that are about things she has <br/>\nshown interest in.  Also look for stuff about your interests  &quot;Field trips&quot; <br/>\nare a school-term, along with educational vs. junk TV, videos, books,etc. <br/>\nand curriculum.  When you go places now with your daughter, what do you call <br/>\nit then?  Going to the zoo, playground, park,etc.  Just keep calling it that <br/>\nand save the school-terms for any reports you have to give to the school <br/>\ndistrict.<br/>\nAs for places to go, take her places she likes and that you think she might <br/>\nlike.
