It is structured sort of like sports competitions, so I  <br/>\ncan see that it might not be everybody&#39;s cup of tea, but it has been  <br/>\nreally fun for us. This is our fifth year and the team of 6 kids is  <br/>\nadamant that they don&#39;t even care how they do at the tournament, they  <br/>\njust want to do it because they enjoy the process. I think it has  <br/>\nbeen REALLY good for them in learning to problem-solve  <br/>\ncollaboratively, for one thing, but also how to put together a  <br/>\ncoherent sequence of events - it can be hard but really useful for  <br/>\npeople to be REALLY creative, off-the-wall, outside the box - and  <br/>\nstill be intelligible, internally consistent in telling stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this activity allowed my kids to keep &quot;playing pretend&quot; long  <br/>\npast the age that most children seem to give it up.
