Any other hot spots like this, organic buying clubs (I&#39;m<br/>\nhaving no luck getting information from the Ozark Co-op to get<br/>\nconnected with one in Florida,) or family-friendly restaurants for<br/>\nthe mainstream diners in our crowd while we&#39;re visiting Toronto?<br/>\n<br/>\nDH went ahead and reserved a couple of suites at the airport and<br/>\nMississauga; all the B&B&#39;s in the High Park area (where our daughter<br/>\nwill be staying) were full. They seemed to be more conveniently<br/>\nlocated, but no more affordable than the hotels offering full<br/>\nbreakfast and a kitchenette. Still open to ideas.

Our oldest daughter will be entering her<br/>\nfirst-ever formal study program at the Academy of Realist Art(.com)<br/>\nthis August. We&#39;ll be tagging along behind her car on the way up to<br/>\nToronto so we can help her get settled in to her new digs. First<br/>\ntime away from home in her tender nineteen-going-on-twentieth year,<br/>\ntoo! Okay *deep breath* I&#39;m ready to let go. Seriously, she&#39;s been<br/>\ndreaming and planning this for the past year -- so we are very<br/>\nexcited that it&#39;s about to happen for her!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, everything seems to be coming together -- Nike found a<br/>\nlovely woman (French translator by profession) on Roommates.com<br/>\noffering a large, sunny room in her home just six blocks or so from<br/>\nthe Academy (Bloor/High Park.) Her director checked it out and gave<br/>\nthe go-ahead, so she&#39;s got that covered. Now we&#39;re checking out the<br/>\noptions to affordably accommodate our crew of nine/ten during our<br/>\nstay (four nights, July 31-August 4.) The kids range in age from 2<br/>\nto 16 (excluding our oldest who won&#39;t be staying in the hotel after<br/>\nthe first night.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso interested in learning about favorite hot spots of the<br/>\nunschooling crowd, and if anything special will be happening on<br/>\nthose dates. We won&#39;t have much time to play while helping Nike get<br/>\neverything set up, but I definitely don&#39;t expect to leave without<br/>\nmaking a memory or two! Thrilled to know there&#39;s a strong<br/>\nunschooling movement afoot in Canada -- we heard about your<br/>\nstruggles many years ago through the Moore Foundation when we were<br/>\nfirst starting out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best from the Ard Family & me ~<br/>\nPenne<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clandees.ardfamilyco-op.net\">http://clandees.ardfamilyco-op.net</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107092,"nextTopicId":107111}}
