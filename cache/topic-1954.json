I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the main reason I got great grades all<br/>\nthrough p.s. -- I could quickly and easily read and write tests and<br/>\npapers.  (I don&#39;t remember any of it though!)  Anyway, I was on my way to<br/>\nour hs parkday and saw &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;danger&quot; on a sign and wondered, what<br/>\non earth are the phonics rules that a beginning reader would use to<br/>\nfigure out how to pronounce those two words (say them out loud if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand what I&#39;m asking).  When I brought it up at the park, a<br/>\nmom (who used to teach in p.s.) explained that anger comes from the<br/>\nGerman language and danger from French.  Well, I imagine that would<br/>\nsimplify things for the average 5-7 year old!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd took off with reading this year.  She was 5 in Sep 98 when we<br/>\nofficially began hs.  I introduced some basic phonics, not in any<br/>\norganized manner, and backed off the minute she seemed to lose interest. <br/>\nI tried to get her to read some 3 letter words, but it was obvious she<br/>\nwas only guessing and didn&#39;t really get it.  Over the course of the year<br/>\nI learned more about unschooling and gained some confidence that it<br/>\nreally is OK to let young children PLAY.  So we spent very little time<br/>\ndoing what most people consider school (like maybe an average of 30<br/>\nminutes a WEEK).  In April and May it clicked for her and she now amazes<br/>\nme with how well she can read.  I don&#39;t take any credit for her &quot;early&quot;<br/>\nreading, she&#39;s just a verbal kid.  Except that I read aloud to them a<br/>\nlot.  And dh reads aloud to them, and now they read aloud to us too (4<br/>\nyear old has memorized some of her picture books).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ironic that some schooling friends are impressed by this -- bc she<br/>\nreads we&#39;re &quot;successful&quot; homeschoolers.  I know that this child has<br/>\nalways been verbal, at age two she could speak incredibly well.  But was<br/>\nalso the LAST one in our &#39;hood to ride without training wheels.  Soooo,<br/>\njust to keep me humble, my 4 year old dd can&#39;t pronounce several<br/>\nconsonant sounds (even I can&#39;t understand her sometimes) & doesn&#39;t want<br/>\nto stop wearing diapers.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be in speech therapy in ps, but<br/>\nI believe she&#39;ll outgrow it.  (Her hearing is fine)  I meanwhile, am<br/>\nstriving to let go and let them be who and what they will.  It&#39;s so hard<br/>\nto let go of all those school lessons after 16 years of it myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nLearning how to be a Mom and a Real Person in Eastern Washington</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lisa Bugg","from":"&quot;Lisa Bugg&quot; &lt;LisaBugg@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"veuo8b2FhZaNjzhlBmMZ9BrzqCfRg6eZ0UhNUBiO_yX4xV5TGTtRbSgTk7yWTs9iXWTeiiTEQDdKR28tPjThuGDpQMAXcWMCUr8a_1Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: phonics","postDate":"934520233","msgId":1955,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNDkuMTk1NS45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1954,"nextInTopic":1976,"prevInTime":1954,"nextInTime":1956,"topicId":1954,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":".
