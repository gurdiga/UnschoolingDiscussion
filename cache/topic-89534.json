I have practiced my faith (I hate <br/>\nthe word religion too)in Christ for almost 20 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deal is this with those of us that are &quot;christian unschoolers&quot; <br/>\nand it&#39;s like Kit said, we were living this lifestyle and found out <br/>\nlater that someone had given it a name, attachment <br/>\nparenting/unschooling.  Now, for the &quot;other than christian&quot; <br/>\nunschoolers out there, I don&#39;t think it is fair for you to say that <br/>\nbecause we christians may have christian moral absolutes we live by <br/>\nthat we can&#39;t be unschoolers.  Are we actually going to get into who <br/>\ncan and can&#39;t be an unschooler?<br/>\nAlso, as a person with a passion for christian theology/history, <br/>\nthere many things that christians in mainstream north american <br/>\nsociety do that are more cultural, than say,biblical.  There wasn&#39;t <br/>\ncompulsory schooling in biblical times, I am not saying there were <br/>\nnot modes of formal learning, but that is different than what we have <br/>\nnow.  Actually, in Deutoronomy (Old Testament book) there is a verse <br/>\nthat goes something like &quot;you will teach your child when he wakes in <br/>\nthe morning, while working in the field and walking in the road...&quot;  <br/>\nI always loved that for unschooling because I thought that is how <br/>\nunschooling parents teach&quot; if you will,just by living day to day with <br/>\nour kids, in the typical moments of a given day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI joke with more traditional homeschool type christian friends that <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t anything in the Bible that says, &quot;Thou shalt sitteth thy <br/>\nchildren down and makest them do school work from 9 to 3pm.&quot;  C&#39;mon!<br/>\nMost of all Jesus,himself, was unschooled, and that is more than good <br/>\nenough for me. :-)And like John Taylor Gatto said( in a great lecture <br/>\non how Christ made disciples) paraphrasing here: Christ didn&#39;t coerce <br/>\npeople to follow him.  He asked everyone to follow him, but not <br/>\neveryone did or has. He gave everyone a choice, theirs free to make.<br/>\nThose that wanted to follow him and hear his teachings stayed.  Same <br/>\nthing with my kids.  I don&#39;t coerce,at least not with Ben and Autumn, <br/>\nand thankfully not with Andrew right now (I got my husband to see the <br/>\nlight another post another time)if they want to know something I help <br/>\nthem, if they want to figure it out themselves fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I will say, that because my husband and I are catholic, we are <br/>\nraising our children in the faith tradition.  It does not mean that <br/>\nour kids can&#39;t question it. It also does not mean that they may not <br/>\nleave it someday. However, whether people here agree or not (and hey <br/>\nthey are my kids not yours)as their parents we want to give our kids <br/>\na faith to cling to as kids. They enjoy going to Mass, enjoy CCD once <br/>\na week (and all the fun social outings there too). As a family we <br/>\nenjoy being in a wonderful faith community.  No matter what one <br/>\nbelieves those are nice things to give a child. However, I understand <br/>\nand respect those who let their kids choose whatever they want. I <br/>\njust would hope that people like me got the same respect in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace out,this is the coolest list ever. I think everyone here is <br/>\njust great!<br/>\nRachel</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Christian Unschooling//Re: WItchcraft type play ...","postDate":"1074577299","msgId":89560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBmMGEwMWMzZGYxOCQxM2QxMDM2MCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PDg3RjFDREUyLTRCMDUtMTFEOC05NDYxLTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":89559,"nextInTopic":89566,"prevInTime":89559,"nextInTime":89561,"topicId":89534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
