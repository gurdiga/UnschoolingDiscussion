It would make sense to most all of us that of course being in school is terrible preparation for becoming a creative person, and being out of school is much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"diana jenner &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Wisdom of Stephen King","postDate":"1110406427","msgId":104336,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyMkY3NTFCLjQwNDAxMDVAc2lvLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":104337,"prevInTime":104335,"nextInTime":104337,"topicId":104336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I find inspiration in the strangest places ...

You&#39;re talented.  Why do you want to <br/>\nwaste your abilities?&quot;... She waited for me to answer -- to her credit <br/>\nthe question was not entirely rhetorical -- but I had no good answer to <br/>\ngive.  I was ashamed.  I have spent a good many years since -- too many <br/>\nI think -- being ashamed about what I write.  I think I was forty before <br/>\nI realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever <br/>\npublished a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her <br/>\nGod-given talent.  If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I <br/>\nsuppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that&#39;s all.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as I see them.&quot; <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n    &quot;My wife made a crucial difference during those two years I spent <br/>\nteaching at Hampden (and washing sheets at New Franklin Laundry during <br/>\nsummer vacation).  If she had suggested that the time I spent writing <br/>\nstories on the front porch of our rented house on Pond Street or in the <br/>\nlaundry room of our rented trailer on Klatt Road in Hermon was wasted <br/>\ntime, I think a lot of the heart would have gone out of me.  Tabby never <br/>\nvoiced a single doubt, however.  Her support was a constant, one of the <br/>\nfew things I could take as a given. And whenever I see a first novel <br/>\ndedicated to a wife (or husband), I smile and think, /There&#39;s someone <br/>\nwho knows/.  Writing is a lonely job.  Having someone who believes in <br/>\nyou makes a lot of difference.  They don&#39;t have to make speeches.  Just <br/>\nbelieving is usually enough.&quot; <br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n    &quot;You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, <br/>\nhopefulness, or even despair -- the sense that you can never completely <br/>\nput on a page what&#39;s in your mind and heart.  You can come to the act <br/>\nwith your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and <br/>\ntake down names.  You can come to it because you want a girl to marry <br/>\nyou or because you want to change the world.  Come to it any way but <br/>\nlightly.  Let me say it again: */you must not come lightly to the blank <br/>\npage/*. <br/>\n    I&#39;m not asking you to come reverently or unquestioningly; I&#39;m not <br/>\nasking you to be politically correct or cast aside your sense of humor <br/>\n(please God you have one).  This isn&#39;t a popularity contest, it&#39;s not <br/>\nthe moral Olympics, and it&#39;s not church.  But it&#39;s /writing/, damn it, <br/>\nnot washing the car or putting on eyeliner.  If you can take it <br/>\nseriously, we can do business.  If you can&#39;t or won&#39;t, it&#39;s time for you <br/>\nto close the book and do something else. <br/>\n    Wash the car, maybe.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n[diana again]<br/>\nThis last one really struck me when you replace the writing concepts <br/>\nwith unschooling ones -- take your whole kid seriously, take your job as <br/>\nparent/life coach seriously... if you can&#39;t or won&#39;t, send those kids to <br/>\nschool.  I don&#39;t want my kids to have memories of me that sound like <br/>\nStephen&#39;s interaction with his principal, I want to create LOTS of <br/>\nmemories like the ones he has of his wife&#39;s constant support of his <br/>\ndreams/who he Is.  This *isn&#39;t* something to be done half-assed.  We and <br/>\nour children deserve more. <br/>\n<br/>\n:) diana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104313,"nextTopicId":104344}}
