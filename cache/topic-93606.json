He likes to watch movies.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, let me try again.  He told me himself that he is bored.  I use <br/>\nthe term &quot;interested&quot; loosely.  When we talk about what he is <br/>\ninterested in conversations he always wants to do more with cooking.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s not to say that he&#39;s doing much with it.  I try to keep <br/>\nopportunity available so that he has opportunity to do what he says <br/>\nhe&#39;s interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as &quot;exploring art&quot; goes.  He has begun an interest in comics.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s not been too artistically inclined for about a year or more.  He <br/>\ngot a little discouraged by two of our other childen&#39;s natural <br/>\nability budding.  He is a perfectionist and doesn&#39;t want to do <br/>\nanything he can&#39;t do perfectly.  That comes into play with the art.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the beauty of a list like this.  Maybe it took me &quot;talking&quot; to <br/>\nyou all to realize that there are things that spark his interest.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s just not really into anything, and maybe it bothers me to see <br/>\nhim so blah so often.  I remember reading that children in this <br/>\nsituation go through that and that it&#39;s normal.  That is the reason I <br/>\nposted about it.  I thought it would be encouraging to hear what <br/>\nothers have been through in similar situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we have been discussing this topic he has been a bit more <br/>\nactive.  He&#39;s not laying around as much.  He&#39;s no longer wandering <br/>\naround aimlessly with a blank expression on his face.  It has been <br/>\nabout a week now since I posted, and it had been going on for quite <br/>\nsome time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Maybe you&#39;re a type A personality and he&#39;s not?

He is very laid <br/>\nback and doesn&#39;t like to be overstimulated.  He&#39;s more of a one on <br/>\none person, as am I.  I like a slower pace, but life doesn&#39;t allow <br/>\nright now.

He also <br/>\n&gt; uses cardboard, books, shoes, cooking spoons, whatever, to build <br/>\n&gt; roadways and garages, etc, for his toy cars... and cars are his <br/>\n&gt; thing.

I&#39;ve only been <br/>\ndoing this 2 years... 1 1/2 years unschooling.  The adjustment was <br/>\nawkward and we initially had periods of boredom... I know what <br/>\nyou&#39;re talking about anyway.  Initially when you&#39;re doing scheduled <br/>\nstuff or whatnot, you don&#39;t have time to be bored but you sure have <br/>\ntime to be miserable.  Suddenly, you have all this time to do what <br/>\nyou want and you just don&#39;t have a clue what in the world to do.  So <br/>\naccustomed to being told &quot;do this, then that&quot; etc.  Is he fully <br/>\naware that he can really do almost anything he wants?  When this <br/>\nkicked in with my youngest (now almost 8) he spents weeks just <br/>\ncutting paper up into little pieces and making a huge mess... but he <br/>\nwas content.  Then the pieces began to take form... animals, <br/>\nletters, etc.  That&#39;s done now.  :)  He&#39;s finally &quot;got it&quot; that if <br/>\nhe comes up with an idea that&#39;s remotely doable (and most everything <br/>\nis doable at least on some level...be creative), he can go for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe spent the first year at home taking everything apart - toys, <br/>\nbroken electronics, etc.  I just supervised the screwdrivers, etc.  <br/>\nThe last couple of months he&#39;s been building completely new things <br/>\nout of all these random parts and having a good old time.  He also <br/>\nuses cardboard, books, shoes, cooking spoons, whatever, to build <br/>\nroadways and garages, etc, for his toy cars... and cars are his <br/>\nthing.  He likes toys that are replicas of actual vehicles you&#39;d see <br/>\non the road.  He can spot a cadillac from 3 blocks away (one of his <br/>\nfaves)... followed by the late 60&#39;s mustang.  lol... (more my speed <br/>\nthere)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also spends a lot of time in the tree outside tying a rope in a <br/>\nhundred different ways... creating some combo of an obstacle course <br/>\nand additional climbing/navigating options... one day he asked for a <br/>\nrope... we bought it... he&#39;s played with it til it&#39;s brown!  It&#39;s <br/>\nonly been a few weeks.  1,000 different uses... that I never thought <br/>\nof.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I ask... does your son completely grasp that any idea that <br/>\nhe comes up with is an idea worth pursuing?  Or is he still in <br/>\nschooly mode where you can&#39;t cross those &quot;lines&quot; or make a mess?  My <br/>\nhouse is a perpetual mess of clay creations, parts of things that <br/>\nwere once whole... magazine clippings (my daughter - 14 spent the <br/>\nentire day yesterday building a scrap book from magazine <br/>\nclippings... she&#39;s taking a fashion design class and has suddenly <br/>\ndeveloped an interest in wedding planning!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an adjustment, yes, I can speak to that.

I think <br/>\nmy &quot;waiting period&quot; is up, so I am eager to start picking your <br/>\nbrains.  That is, of course, if you feel like sharing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a combined family of seven children.  They are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nTabitha, 18 - Public School Senior<br/>\nAmy, 17 - Public School Senior<br/>\nTammi and Tracey, 16 - Public School Junior<br/>\nAmie, 14 - Charter School 8th Grade<br/>\nAndrew, 12 - Charter School 6th Grade<br/>\nAdrian, 10 - Home School <br/>\n<br/>\nI shared the above to give you a feel for the dynamics of our <br/>\nfamily.  It&#39;s a VERY long story...Amy, 17 and Adrian, 10 are my <br/>\nbiological children.  I learned about homeschooling too late to start <br/>\nwith Amy, or so I thought.  Right from the beginning, we knew that we <br/>\nwere going to home school Adrian due to the terrible school system.  <br/>\nWe just didn&#39;t want to put another child in that system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not figured out how to LEGALLY homeschool Amie and Andrew, <br/>\notherwise I would for sure.  They actually request to be home <br/>\nschooled.  I do include them in our summer activities as learning is <br/>\na year long practice not devided into quarters and holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started homeschooling Adrian from the beginning and only made it <br/>\nthrough to kindergarden as we thought the smart choice was to put our <br/>\nthree youngest in a highly acclaimed partnership school.  Bad choice <br/>\nthere!  Live and learn.  Fortunately, I continuously educate myself.  <br/>\nAfter changes were made to the educational institution that we <br/>\nenrolled them in we quickly figured out that it would not work for <br/>\nour family.  I pulled Adrian out after Christmas break in third grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince that time I have read numerous books.  I am a true book worm, <br/>\nso this comes completely natural.  I love research, so what better <br/>\ntopic?  We started out very scheduled because that was what Adrian <br/>\nwanted.  Our lives continued to shift and change, so it warranted <br/>\nchange in our approach to education.  Throughout our journey I have <br/>\nlearned more and more about the philosophy of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have instituted the philosophy of unschooling in our home this <br/>\nyear.  So, needless to say it is VERY new to us.  I understand and <br/>\nagree with the philosophy to the best of my ability.  I know it&#39;s a <br/>\njourney and a process, especially given our history.  We are <br/>\ncurrently reading &quot;I Learn Better by Teaching Myself&quot; by Agnes <br/>\nLeistico and plan to read the follow up book &quot;Still Teaching <br/>\nOurselves&quot; as soon as we finish this one.  I thought it a good idea <br/>\nfor us to read it together.  I wanted Adrian to have a little <br/>\nunderstanding of what we were doing, and he absolutely loves to be <br/>\nread to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all that, my question is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you make it through the boredom stage?  Right now he doesn&#39;t <br/>\ndo a whole lot.  When I ask him what he&#39;s interested in he <br/>\nsays, &quot;Nothing.&quot;  I know that eventually he will get into something, <br/>\nbut what is so called normal for this time period of adjustment?  We <br/>\nhave made it through things that were difficult for me to not <br/>\ninterfere with like playing PS2 all day, everyday.  I know and accept <br/>\nthat this is perfectly normal and acceptable in the unschooling <br/>\nphilosoply, but it goes against everything ingrained in our heads.  <br/>\nYou know where I&#39;m coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has gone through this from a <br/>\nsimilar situation.  I&#39;d love to hear how you and your children <br/>\nadjusted as former institutional schoolers, to structured <br/>\nhomeschoolers, to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI welcome your wisdom...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94830,"nextTopicId":94849}}
