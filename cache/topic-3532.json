Aside from that, I also find things that come up that may just<br/>\ninterest them also, without them thinking about it. Just like I would say,<br/>\n&quot;hey there&#39;s a new movie coming out about______, do you want to go and see<br/>\nit?&quot; I would also ask if they are interested in swimming class or baseball<br/>\nor whatever. The decision is always there. Sometimes they come up with<br/>\nthings and sometimes I do. If I get a notion that it&#39;s a beautiful day for<br/>\nthe park, I&#39;ll ask. If they want to go, we&#39;re there. If not, we stay put. I<br/>\nnever push, in any way, any of the above mentioned issues. Not movies,<br/>\nsports ,math, reading or anything.

As long as<br/>\nno one says, &quot;you really NEED to go to the park with me or you NEED to stop<br/>\nwatching tv or even why don&#39;t you stop doing that and find something else to<br/>\ndo for awhile&quot; then suggesting when an interest could be there is great.<br/>\nIt&#39;s pushing when no interest exists that is harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] need advice","postDate":"1050366526","msgId":64891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Ni4xZWNlODE1Yi4yYmNjYWMzZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64878,"nextInTopic":64892,"prevInTime":64890,"nextInTime":64892,"topicId":3532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/14/03 12:55:09 PM, rubyprincesstsg@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-177791652\">In a message dated 4/14/03 12:55:09 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I also got told I was WRONG, totally wrong for buying a computer <br/>\ngame and leaving it for my daughter to play or not play, no expectations.  <br/>\nThat I shouldn&#39;t even be sending her links that I think are interesting,  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this list missing a lot of posts still?

Tell him he <br/>\nwill get his way more if he allows other people to feel, sometimes, that <br/>\nthey&#39;re getting their way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two stories.   One is Kirby, who is often the most sparkly, <br/>\nknowledgeable and verbal guy in a conversation.  After noting a few times <br/>\nthat one person or another was feeling unable to get into the exchange, I got <br/>\na chance to be alone with Kirby (driving him to karate) and said I thing X <br/>\nwas uncomfortable yesterday, because the conversation was moving so fast and <br/>\nso focussed on you.  Maybe part of being a good host is trying to draw <br/>\neveryone into the conversation.  You&#39;re so interesting it&#39;s hard for them to <br/>\ncompete.  Don&#39;t hog the air.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other time I just said &quot;Don&#39;t breathe more than your share of the air&quot; <br/>\nand he backed down from the spotlight and listened to the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other story is older, but involves a club&#39;s politics.  I learned this <br/>\ntrick on my own, and have passed it on to others with good results.  When <br/>\nclubs or projects are running by consensus and group effort, it can happen <br/>\nthat one person is getting his way a lot, not because he&#39;s a bully, but <br/>\nbecause his ideas are good and workable.  Still, no matter how workable, <br/>\nthere is an overlay in this society of taking turns and sharing, and <br/>\nequality.  So at some point someone will say &quot;Well, Mark (to use a real <br/>\nexample &lt;g&gt;) has gotten his way the last five times, so let&#39;s let Kathryn (to <br/>\nuse a similar real name from the early situations) run it her way this time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appeases Kathryn, but is it good for the group?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they won&#39;t really SAY &quot;You&#39;ve maxed out your quota of influence, so your <br/>\nideas will be rejected until you&#39;re back to acceptable levels.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the way for that person to get the good ideas accepted is to plant them in <br/>\nother people.  Either give them away so they can be presented by others who <br/>\nknow they were your ideas but who will accept credit just for the sake of <br/>\ngetting the idea accepted, or putting it into the mind of a more selfish, <br/>\nsusceptible, needy person who WANTS to have his way, and just needed a good <br/>\nidea to run with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis can work two ways with a battering-ram of a kid.  You can teach him that <br/>\ntrick.  Or you can use that trick on him.  If he&#39;s not going to take your <br/>\nadvice one more time, get someone else to drop a factoid or suggestion or a <br/>\n&quot;y&#39;know...&quot; his way.  If they come from various places, he can&#39;t &quot;ignore <br/>\nmom.&quot;  And when he&#39;s old enough to KNOW he wants his own way and to be <br/>\nanalytical about it, you could say &quot;If you want to go to the movie you want <br/>\nto go to, convince one of the other kids to want to go to it and to propose <br/>\nit as HIS choice.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA criticism of this is that it&#39;s teaching a child to be manipulative, but <br/>\nmanipulation by another name is...  management.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s already BEING manipulative, teaching him to do it gently and <br/>\nunselfishly and convincing him (honestly) that it will up his stock and <br/>\npopularity is a kindness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"Mark & Julie","from":"&quot;Mark & Julie&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"need advice","postDate":"1048061704","msgId":61356,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMyZWRlZiRhNjI2NzRlMCRlMTY4MzJkMkBtYXJrPg=="},"prevInTopic":3532,"nextInTopic":61357,"prevInTime":61355,"nextInTime":61357,"topicId":3532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest child is nearly nine.
