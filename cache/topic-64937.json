Mine went through the pink, blue and purple hair. {even the then 2 year old} I liked the purple the best. It was semi-perm but because they had naturally blonde hair, and the two oldest&#39;s hair had a previous chemical {I&#39;m a cosmetologist and streaked their hair for them} it grabbed. They wore it for a while but got tired of it and I got it out for them. They may try it again later, if so it&#39;s cool with me.

My son, who is 8, has been wearing a<br/>\nbra for the past year (I bought it for him and he stuffs it with the<br/>\nplastic tops from the Bionicle containers).  He wears it to bed, to the<br/>\nbeach, out to lunch, everywhere.  He&#39;s gotten used to stares from<br/>\npeople, but he is protected by me, his dad and his papa from others who<br/>\nwant to comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was 2 1/2 he asked me if I would make him a sparkly dress (we<br/>\nwere watching a lot of Fred and Ginger movies at the time and he wanted<br/>\nto be Ginger Rogers).  We went to the fabric store and he picked out the<br/>\nmaterial and the pattern.  It was a beautiful dress! and he wore it for<br/>\na few years - then I made him a new one and his sister wore the old one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a party one day (Robin - son - was about 4) I was talking to a male<br/>\nteacher friend about unschooling, Robin&#39;s dress, etc....  He stared at<br/>\nme in disbelief, I thought - oh boy, here it comes.  Then he said very<br/>\nquietly, &quot;I wish my mom had made me a sparkly dress.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMade me glad that we are doing what we are for our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho spent the whole day at the beach with her dad and her kids flying<br/>\nkites and visiting.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Another parenting question","postDate":"1050406905","msgId":64937,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhLjNjNjgzMTkzLjJiY2Q0OWY5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65013,"prevInTime":64936,"nextInTime":64938,"topicId":64937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/14/2003 11:37:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
