I can <br/>\ngive you one reason that golfing or baseball or basketball MIGHT require a <br/>\ncoach and SCA combat (which I am completely unfamiliar with but trust your <br/>\njudgment that it doesn&#39;t require a coach) the one BIG difference, THOUSANDS <br/>\nof dollars in scholarships, endorsements, and a possible pro career.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nsaying it&#39;s good or bad but if your child appears to have a natural talent <br/>\nand loves something that could very well lead to a multi million dollar <br/>\ncareer, to me that would be reasons parents choose private coaches.  Again, <br/>\nnot my judgment as to whether it&#39;s right or wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already said we&#39;ve had private coaches for different things my children <br/>\nwanted to do, even the child who was practically born with a baseball in his <br/>\nhand wanted private coaches at some point, he got them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s just simply about what the child WANTS.  If they ask, then it&#39;s OK <br/>\nto provide that for them, but if the parent is PUSHING it, it&#39;s probably not <br/>\na good thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think sometimes it just  a play on words.  If you child had the opportunity <br/>\nto study/play with someone they highly looked up to for their skill at what <br/>\never you child enjoys and your child spent a given amount of time with them <br/>\nsay playing games or SCA or whatever, it would be like mentoring and a good <br/>\nthing.  Basically with some coaches it&#39;s the same thing, you get to spend <br/>\ntime with them learning the things YOU want so much to like them but sports <br/>\npeople charge you for it and call it coaching.  Some don&#39;t charge all the <br/>\ntime though, if they think you&#39;re good enough, they&#39;re glad to have the <br/>\nopportunity to say they coached __________________.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while a lot of changing in thinking has to be done to get to the point <br/>\nsome of you are in your unschooling journey, sometimes I&#39;m finding out it&#39;s <br/>\njust different words for the same thing.

Knowledge is power.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found unschooling.com very early in my homeschooling decision.  Katy<br/>\nwent to kindergarten and we decided during that year to homeschool.  I<br/>\nmet someone who had started homeschooling that year,  and unschooled.  I<br/>\nread at the website and began reading at this e-list.  That was almost 6<br/>\nyears ago.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even after reading and thinking I understood unschooling ideas,  I<br/>\nfound myself in periods of frustration and impatience about reading.  I<br/>\nfound within my mind all the ideas that had been ingrained:  if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t read early,  you are less intelligent,  without reading you cannot<br/>\ngain knowledge.  I *knew* on some levels (through reading mostly LOL)<br/>\nthat there are other forms of intelligence.  But the idea of reading<br/>\nlate and all the little goblins society had planted in my psyche about<br/>\nit have haunted me for years.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have gradually let them go as I become aware of them.  I believe my<br/>\nyounger children will benefit most.  I believe my attitudes,  mental<br/>\nfears and creepy doubts have hindered Katy in learning to read.  And I<br/>\nbelieve she will read well at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find my own journey in unschooling as powerful in enabling me to work<br/>\ntoward what Maslow would call self actualization.  Two recent things<br/>\nhave brought me even further on this journey in regard to reading.<br/>\nFirst,  my parents died last fall.  (each of separate illnesses, nine<br/>\ndays apart)  And we moved to a new home/neighborhood.  The drama and<br/>\nbusyness of real life consumed me and there was no time to read.  After<br/>\nthe deaths and funerals, etc.  I found several what I call &quot;grief<br/>\nhandicaps&quot;.  One was that I was not capable of reading.  Oh,  I could<br/>\nread words,  but I didn&#39;t care to,  and had little to no comprehension.<br/>\nMore than a few paragraphs on something absolutely pertinent to my needs<br/>\ndid not compute.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have learned more in some ways in the past 6 months than I can<br/>\neven explain.  I have learned how *I* am capable of learning in other<br/>\nways besides reading.  And how limiting it is to learn primarily through<br/>\nreading.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mental breakthrough came through Sandra.  Her descriptions of<br/>\nHolly being in the theater production.  Sandra explained how Holly<br/>\nmemorized her lines (this came up here again recently).  And Sandra&#39;s<br/>\ndescription of Holly doing a presentation with her Girl Scout Troop was<br/>\na big &quot;AHA&quot; thing for me.  To paraphrase and summarize,  Sandra<br/>\ndescribed how Holly,  though she wasn&#39;t reading, was able to present her<br/>\ntopic in a lively way.  Holly really *knew* her stuff.  Whereas,  most<br/>\nof the &#39;reading&#39; scouts read reports in a monotone and showed little<br/>\ndepth of knowledge or real enjoyment of the subject.<br/>\n(Thanks,  Sandra....one more example of how you impact others for the<br/>\ngreater good.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting note,  during the past 6 months,  Katy has begun to show<br/>\nan interest and growth in reading.

He spent the next 4 years gathering more and <br/>\nmore information.  At 7 and one month, he read Green Eggs and Ham with no <br/>\nassistance.  I was just patient and didn&#39;t push the issue. I never tested him <br/>\nor quizzed him or tried to get him to read.  If he became interested in <br/>\nknowing what something said, I would let him know I was present to him and he <br/>\ncould ask me if he needed help.  I trusted him and knew that he wanted to <br/>\nread, and that it would just be a matter of brain development.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him anything about reading.  We lived our life and words and <br/>\nletters and ideas attached to them occurred (and still occur) as a part of it <br/>\nevery day.  I shared with him about letters and reading the same way I shared <br/>\nhow to cut up his pancakes.  I read to him when he asked and interpreted <br/>\nsigns for him and didn&#39;t push.    I made sure I affirmed to him that reading <br/>\nwas something he would develop into, just like getting better at baseball (in <br/>\nwhich he is intensely interested).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son doesn&#39;t like to be read to, by the way.  That&#39;s a standard thing <br/>\npeople say about kids and education, both schoolers and homeschoolers--just <br/>\nread to them, that&#39;s the best thing you can do for their education.  When he <br/>\nwas a toddler, I read to him all the regular books, but he had little <br/>\npatience for all the words.  He wanted to see the pictures.  If I wanted to <br/>\nread it all, I had to read FAST!   Now that he is reading fluently and longer <br/>\nbooks, he still doesn&#39;t want to be read to.  But he will listen to books on <br/>\ntape, especially if they are acted instead of read.  He doesn&#39;t always pay <br/>\nattention to those, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach child is different.
