I get a lot of emails for various projects and <br/>\nhave sorted them on yahoo.  (I love yahoo.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did to resolve this:  Go to the section for your group <br/>\nsettings and click on the part that says no emails.  Then once a day, <br/>\nor once a week, or whenever, you can just to to the group as it is <br/>\nsaved in your section in yahoo called &quot;my groups.&quot;  I love this <br/>\nfeature because it lowers my incoming emails.  The downside is that <br/>\nyou might miss something. but these days, being so busy, it is good <br/>\nfor me to miss something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I love Raymond.  Please tell us what happened!<br/>\n<br/>\nSheree</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44869,"nextTopicId":44918}}
