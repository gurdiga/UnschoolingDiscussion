We had signed up for a workshop called, <br/>\n&quot;Re-creating Radio.&quot; We were 12 kids and 7 moms. Some did performance <br/>\nparts and others did sound effects and we put on a radio drama - aliens <br/>\ninvading and a planet being destroyed, etc. Pretty cool script with a <br/>\nsurprise twist at the end. The sound effect stuff was very cool, too - <br/>\nlots of gizmos and also everyday things used. We did one rehearsal and <br/>\nthen recorded the program. The kids were AWESOME - these are very <br/>\ntheatrically-oriented kids and the museum people were very impressed. <br/>\nThey usually just give you the tape of the show, but they wanted to <br/>\nkeep it to use as a sample for other groups or to play for people when <br/>\nthey&#39;re trying to get them to contribute to the museum, so they&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to send us copies of the recording later this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a Museum of Radio and Television in New York City, too, as <br/>\nwell as here in Beverly Hills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - after the workshop, the museum was open to the public and we <br/>\nstayed. It was just such a gratifying feeling to be in such a BEAUTIFUL <br/>\nplace - the museum architecture is spacious and gorgeous - that is <br/>\ndevoted to tv and takes it seriously and is just unabashed about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe have various screening rooms with big screens and a schedule of <br/>\nshows being broadcast each day - so you can just go and watch. And they <br/>\nhave a huge library of shows - you select what you want to watch and <br/>\nsit at a personal &quot;console&quot; to watch it. On a big-screen, I watched a <br/>\nAlfred Hitchcock piece about a man who was thought to be dead, after a <br/>\ncar crash, but wasn&#39;t. I also listened, in the listening room, to an <br/>\nhour&#39;s worth of &quot;I&#39;m Sorry, I&#39;ll Read that Again,&quot; which was John <br/>\nCleese and Eric Idle and Graham Chapman and some other comedians in a <br/>\nradio show they did pre-Monty Python days. It was very very good - very <br/>\nfunny. Some of the kids watched old Twilight Zone episodes in a group <br/>\nscreening room. Roxana watched a video of &quot;Company&quot; - the musical. I <br/>\nalso watched the Ed Sullivan show with the Beatles appearing for the <br/>\nfirst time. They were showing the various Simpsons Halloween specials <br/>\nin a big-screen viewing room, too, but we went out to get lunch and <br/>\nmissed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be going back, for sure. It was free, by the way - although they <br/>\nhave suggested donation amounts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to think, in advance, of what I might like to see and things <br/>\nthe kids might like. I know one thing is a broadcast of the first moon <br/>\nlanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - any other suggestions?
