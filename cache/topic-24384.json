Did you find anything objectionable in <br/>\n&gt; the software?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First, it&#39;s absolutely worth buying. Lots of fun, problem solving...oh, <br/>\nforget the list of the educational value...there&#39;s probably plenty, but it&#39;s <br/>\njust lots of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to buy The Sims first, then you can add expansion packs. You can <br/>\nalso download stuff from the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is rated Teen. The first pack mostly involves people kissing, and when <br/>\nthey REALLY like each other they grab each other&#39;s butts.  If you get the <br/>\nLiving Large expansion pack, it includes a &quot;Love Bed,&quot; where there&#39;s an <br/>\noption to &quot;Play in bed.&quot; The involves the Sims getting naked (which is <br/>\nblurred out...the Sims are not graphic kinda folks), going under the covers <br/>\ncompletely and lumps jiggling around. There are giggling sounds.  The next <br/>\nexpansion pack, House Party, has a cake that either a male or female dancer <br/>\njumps out of and dances sort of suggestively.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy almost 12 year old son and his friend recently spent an entire day having <br/>\none character gather many &quot;lovers,&quot; male and female, and &quot;making out&quot; with <br/>\nthem. Some they &quot;played in bed&quot; with. Every time they&#39;d get another &quot;lover&quot; <br/>\nthey&#39;d gleefully run in and tell me about it. These are two YOUNG twelve year <br/>\nolds--first time really expressing any interest in sexuality like this (other <br/>\nthan those conversations wih their respective parents.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t have any problem with it because I know what kind of values both <br/>\nboys have (and Friend&#39;s parents are VERY good friends of mine...I might have <br/>\ndiscouraged this if it had been another friend). You may have different <br/>\nfeelings about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part, I find the Sims fine on his stuff. Adults will only sleep <br/>\n(Sleep, not other stuff) with other adults who are &quot;friends.&quot; (Based on <br/>\nrelationship score). They&#39;ll only &quot;&quot;Play in bed&quot; with adults they &quot;love.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other potential concern would be &quot;animated violence.&quot; Sims who hate each <br/>\nother sometimes slap or fight. However, it&#39;s programmed in that men do not <br/>\nhit or fight women, and  NO ONE hits or fights kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24902,"nextTopicId":24972}}
