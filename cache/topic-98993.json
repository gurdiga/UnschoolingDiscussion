My son (also David) is 8yo. He learned his letters &quot;on <br/>\nschedule&quot; but was &quot;behind&quot; (according to my mom) on putting sounds <br/>\nand words together. I&#39;ve been very relaxed about the whole reading <br/>\nthing, expecting that it would come when he was ready. He&#39;s been <br/>\nlearning how to spell a lot of words the past year or so, and we read <br/>\nto him all the time. I could see him absorbing and digesting the <br/>\nwords as we spelled for him and as we read to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, we were on a weekend away with my mom, when she asked David <br/>\nto read something. He piped up with &quot;I can&#39;t read!&quot; Well, I could see <br/>\nin her face what she was thinking, but she didn&#39;t say anything. The <br/>\nvery next day we were in a bookstore and David picked up a simple <br/>\nbook (Biscuit) and read the whole thing to me (of course, I helped <br/>\nhim with any words he couldn&#39;t figure out). Just like that, he&#39;s now <br/>\na reader. He&#39;s into very simple books for now - we&#39;re just moving <br/>\ninto some of the easier Step 1 books about animals. He&#39;ll stay at <br/>\nthis level for as long as he needs then he&#39;ll move up on his own. He <br/>\nreads to me every day and he chose when to move into a slightly more <br/>\ndifficult book.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing - he told me last week &quot;Mom, I love to read.&quot; That&#39;s <br/>\nwhat I wanted to hear from him. I don&#39;t want to raise a child who <br/>\nreads because he&#39;s supposed to. I want to raise a child who loves to <br/>\nread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planning to wait longer (years) if that&#39;s what he needed. It <br/>\nwould have gotten more and more difficult (for me), but I was willing <br/>\nto do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie<br/>\nHighland, NY</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] When does a person become a &quot;reader&quot;?","postDate":"1094183254","msgId":99002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEQTNFMDZFLUZENUItMTFEOC1CN0M1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNoN2kxYitnNTZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNoN2kxYitnNTZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":98998,"nextInTopic":99017,"prevInTime":99001,"nextInTime":99003,"topicId":98993,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
