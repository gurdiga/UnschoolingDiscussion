Can you move the cursor around on the screen?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There isn&#39;t any cursor, I told you, it won&#39;t accept anything I type.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Does your monitor have a power indicator?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s a monitor?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV.  Does it <br/>\nhave a <br/>\nlittle light that tells you when it&#39;s on?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power <br/>\ncord goes <br/>\ninto it. Can you see that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it&#39;s plugged into <br/>\nthe wall.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;.......Yes, it is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two <br/>\ncables <br/>\nplugged into the back of it, not just one?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the <br/>\nother cable.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;.......Okay, here it is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Follow it for me, and tell me if it&#39;s plugged securely into the back <br/>\nof your <br/>\ncomputer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I can&#39;t reach.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh, it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t have the right angle - it&#39;s because <br/>\nit&#39;s dark.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Dark?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming <br/>\nin  from <br/>\nthe window.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, turn on the office light then.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No? Why not?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Because there&#39;s a power outage.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A power... A power outage? Ah, Okay, we&#39;ve got it licked now. Do you <br/>\nstill <br/>\nhave the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like <br/>\nit was when <br/>\nyou got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Really? Is it that bad?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid it is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, all right then, I suppose.
