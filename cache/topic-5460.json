OY OY OY.<br/>\ni find the thoughts and judgments of others to be very loud and invasive<br/>\nand i&#39;ve struggled with the expectations of others.  i  found it hard to<br/>\nrespond to situations the way i wanted to with this &#39;yammering&#39; in my<br/>\nears.  finally i just made a hard personal stand to let the judgments be<br/>\nand just ignore them - this was very difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing you mean play in general, not play to find a way to make<br/>\nthem give up their toys!  :)<br/>\nabsolutely as tempting as coercion maybe in the long run i believe it<br/>\nundermines the child&#39;s ability to be trusting and honest - the ends<br/>\ndon&#39;t justify the means.<br/>\n<br/>\nA man at our Ethical culture meeting recently told a story about how he<br/>\nfound a little boy throwing rocks at a squirrel in a tree.  He was<br/>\ninternally appalled but then he asked the little boy *why* he was doing<br/>\nit. The boy replied &quot;so I can get the squirrel to come down and I can<br/>\ntake care of him and have him as a pet.&quot;  Man.  That story has stayed<br/>\nwith me.  I always try to ask Annie (even at her age--I hope that it<br/>\nwill rub off) what she&#39;s trying to do when something happens that<br/>\nsurprises me.<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is a great example of just how differently a child perceives his<br/>\nown actions.  it&#39;s our responsibility to understand the perspective of<br/>\nthe child to help them learn to act and communicate just what they<br/>\nintend.  it&#39;s not that we should let the child continue to &#39;throw rocks<br/>\nat a squirrel in a tree&#39; but to help them find ways in which their goal<br/>\nwill be achieved (bring some food and water out and give the squirrel<br/>\nsome distance)<br/>\n<br/>\nhere&#39;s a recent experience we&#39;ve had.   rene&#39; (4) is very physical.  he<br/>\nlikes to &#39;boink and be boinked :)  he&#39;s extremely exuberant and vocal<br/>\nand we&#39;ve been &#39;struggling&#39; with getting him to understand that most<br/>\npeople are different from him and don&#39;t like being &#39;boinked&#39;.<br/>\nintellectually he comprehends but he has yet to make this an instinctive<br/>\nthing, so he spends lots of time saying he&#39;s sorry.   we&#39;ve tried<br/>\neverything,  holding him, talking to him, removing him, spanking<br/>\nhim-nothing works.  so now i&#39;ve been asking him what he would need for<br/>\nhim to stop and he said, after sometime, that i needed to teach him<br/>\nmanners and that was my job.   i said i&#39;ve been trying but nothing seems<br/>\nto work.  his reply was &#39; you need to be in my brain and stop me before<br/>\ni do it&#39;.   my conclusion is that we all have our struggles and for some<br/>\nfitting in and conforming to what is considered acceptable behavior is<br/>\ntheir big hurdle.  so my job is not to force conformity but to point out<br/>\noptions and alternatives he could choose and be patient and loving - but<br/>\ndiligent.  for myself i needed to understand that often the answer is<br/>\nnot immediate or simple but developes over time.<br/>\n<br/>\ni realized his behavior was merely a reflection of his relationship to<br/>\nthe world and that that relationship was facilitated not only by me but<br/>\nby his age and every other relationship he had.  what i needed to do was<br/>\nto interpret what he was communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis end-part sounds kind of like the ethical culture story...but I&#39;d<br/>\nreally appreciate it if you would say more on &quot;his behavior was a<br/>\nreflection of his relationship to the world&quot;, either on- or off-list.<br/>\n<br/>\n i find in my own life that if i&#39;m always being corrected or questioned<br/>\ni spend most of my time and energy being defensive and virtually no<br/>\ntime  or energy becoming the kind of person that i want to be.  i think<br/>\nwe, culturally, size kids up (and their parents &#39;good kid=good<br/>\nparent/bad kid=bad parent) and this, though often unspoken, is very much<br/>\nfelt and evokes a defensive attitude or perspective which detracts from<br/>\nall relationships including the one we have with ourselves.   children<br/>\nneed to learn to understand and communicate what is happening inside<br/>\nthem so they can develop compassion and understanding for themselves and<br/>\nothers but if conformity is all we want then the individual is lost.<br/>\nit&#39;s important for children to learn that they are part of something<br/>\nbigger than themselves but that the self is the vehicle for the<br/>\nmanifestation of this understanding.   children need to separate<br/>\nthemselves and create an identity in a loving and compassionate<br/>\nenvironment so that later they can be compassionate, understanding and<br/>\ndynamic members of society.<br/>\n<br/>\nif a child experiences constant judgment and correction they begin to<br/>\nsee the world as merely a place of power - who has it and who doesn&#39;t.<br/>\nbut if we reflect a different sort of world - one where their desires<br/>\nand opinions matter (i don&#39;t want to share) then later they will ask and<br/>\ncare what is happening to others (since their own needs were recognized)<br/>\nand for me this is the basic component of community.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy son knows that i have &#39;ultimate veto power&#39;  though he also knows i<br/>\nnever exercise this without completely hearing him out and if i do<br/>\n&#39;veto&#39; something we discuss the reasons.  yes this process is long and<br/>\ninvolved and i&#39;ve begun a discussion completely against something and<br/>\nhis stance has been compelling and i&#39;ve changed my position.  this<br/>\nrelationship is very fluid and though i do maintain a position of<br/>\nauthority, it is always in the context of trust and understanding.  if<br/>\nhe does not feel understood he will never trust me and then my authority<br/>\nwould be merely power and that, in my opinion, would not help him<br/>\ndevelop into a strong contributing member of society nor a happy and<br/>\nsatisfied individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a very instructive story, especially in the health-situation I&#39;m<br/>\nin right now. Thanks.<br/>\nwould you elaborate on your health situation.  i came down with an<br/>\nautoimmune disease, still&#39;s disease (believed to be vaccine related),<br/>\nwhen rene&#39; was 20 months old and it has radically changed our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmy thoughts,<br/>\nsusan austin, tx</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5454,"nextTopicId":5461}}
