I ordered and<br/>\nowned the first rootbeer brown and cream truck that became quite the in<br/>\nthing after that dumb Travolta movie.  From there it was downhill!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, once they became &quot;in&quot; the manufacturers started adding all kinds<br/>\nof toys to them all of which have added to the price and reduced the<br/>\nefficiency of the vehicles.  I use to get 17 mpg pulling a trailer loaded<br/>\nwith 5 horses and 250 pounds of feed plus tack AND with a cabover camper and<br/>\n5 kids and two dogs and that was going up the Grapevine!  There is no way<br/>\nthese newer &quot;efficient&quot; smogged up, electronic gadgeted things could do<br/>\nthat!  And, before someone jumps on the whole smog thing, my trucks (I won&#39;t<br/>\nown anything built after 1971) still pass tests with a better rating than<br/>\nbrand new vehicles and that is with all the smog garbage removed!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as long as I&#39;m on this soapbox &lt;g&gt; I think folks that drive minivans<br/>\nshould have to take a behind-the-wheel driving test, also!  And I won&#39;t even<br/>\ngo into the driving ability of most folks with van conversions!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;And , I have to admit, if you actually USE<br/>\n&gt; the SUV as a SPORT UTILITY VEHICLE, thats great, but<br/>\n&gt; there are so many out there buying those things just<br/>\n&gt; to look good at the mall parking lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Have you read Bobos in Paradise?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mary Ellen </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"megates@juno.com","from":"megates@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"xTw51-FvP5mbXAGmK-5JUMfOeGRlh79aRqrLpPGVHUhTteYEMnUejb8hYyZugyHYhbrieaiXCw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: SUV&#39;s","postDate":"981053781","msgId":15755,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMjAyLjA3MjcwNS4tMjg5OTM5LjAubWVnYXRlc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15762,"prevInTime":15754,"nextInTime":15756,"topicId":15755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the SUV as a SPORT UTILITY VEHICLE, thats great, but there are so many out there buying those things just to look good at the mall parking lot.
