So it&#39;s more like reading a <br/>\npoem aloud in a foreign language for most people, maybe.  You need to work <br/>\nthrough each phrase, find out what it means, double-check your accent, learn to <br/>\ndo it without tongue-stumbling, learn to do it so that you sound like a <br/>\nnative, and a native who understands it and is reading well, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think when beginners to reading music see the music, they balk and <br/>\nfreeze up, thinking &quot;reading&quot; is coming to a point where they just see it and it <br/>\ncomes out of their hands or mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s even much harder, reading music vocally.   Most people will play <br/>\nit out on a piano (or have someone else do that) the first many times.  They&#39;re <br/>\nstill reading along, but there are intervals (jumps from note to note) that <br/>\nare just difficult to guess.  Maybe in that case it&#39;s like a dancer reading <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s choreographic notations.  They&#39;re not going to hold the book in <br/>\nhand and dance the whole thing  as intened.  They&#39;re going to study little <br/>\nsections at a time and eventually put it all together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo some people say &quot;I can&#39;t read music&quot; because in their imaginations they <br/>\nhave overshot the mark most people who feel themelves to be competent music <br/>\nreaders have settled  on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are people who can write a tune down as they hear it (but will ask <br/>\nfor pauses or second hearings, maybe), but they&#39;re rare and have a <br/>\nparticularly concentrated/freakish talent.   Y&#39;know how people will videotape a movie in <br/>\na theatre nowadays (in Asian countries, the stereotype goes &lt;g&gt;) and then make <br/>\ncopies?   There are stories of people having gone to Gilbert and Sullivan <br/>\noperettas in the1890s, writing music down as they sat, and publishing it the next <br/>\nday or so.  I&#39;m guessing maybe hey had friends with them to also swipe lyrics <br/>\nand help them remember hazy parts.  Maybe they went back twice to <br/>\ndouble-check their notes. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a dying art, in the face of modern technology.  Even working from a <br/>\nrecording like a dictophone transcriptionist is too much work when one can play <br/>\nthe tune on a MIDI keyboard and have a computer program throw a basic guess at <br/>\nputting it into notation.  Then with a mouse and the pulldown menus of other <br/>\npeople&#39;s programs, it can be tweaked and polished, other voices added, and <br/>\nthen the computer can read it all back in the instruments&#39;  voices you&#39;ve <br/>\nspecified, or you can print it out for live musicians with instruments made out of <br/>\nwood or metal or something. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Kinesthetic/Random-Abstract","postDate":"1099147254","msgId":100901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI0MTlDREQ1LTJBODEtMTFEOS05RDgxLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNsdjhyaStqbmg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNsdjhyaStqbmg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100900,"nextInTopic":100902,"prevInTime":100900,"nextInTime":100902,"topicId":100874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s on physics, but includes <br/>\nthe necessary math.  (Doesn&#39;t actually look like there&#39;s much <br/>\ncalculus in there.  Highest it seems to be is trig.)  It&#39;s called <br/>\nPhysics Demystified, by Stan Gibilisco.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the back cover:<br/>\n<br/>\nNow anyone with an interest in the physical sciences can master <br/>\nphysics -- without formal training or drowning in a sea of <br/>\ncomplicated formulas and equations. In Physics Demystified best-<br/>\nselling author Stan Gibilisco offers a fun, effective, and totally <br/>\npainless way to learn the fundamentals and general concepts of <br/>\nphysics. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Physics Demystified you master the subject one simple step at a <br/>\ntime â&quot; at your own speed. Unlike most books on physics, general <br/>\nprinciples are presented first â&quot; and the details follow. In order to <br/>\nmake the learning process as clear and simple as possible, heavy-duty <br/>\nmath, formulas, and equations are kept to a minimum. This unique self-<br/>\nteaching guide offers questions at the end of each chapter and <br/>\nsection to pinpoint weaknesses, and a 100-question final exam to <br/>\nreinforce the entire book.  &lt;Me: I don&#39;t know about THIS. :-)&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSimple enough for a beginner but challenging enough for an advanced <br/>\nstudent, Physics Demystified is your direct route to learning or <br/>\nbrushing up on physics.<br/>\n<br/>\nHEREâS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO:<br/>\n* Understand the math used in physical science<br/>\n* Solve mass/force/acceleration problems<br/>\n* Create mathematical models of physical phenomena<br/>\n* Perform distance vs. time calculations<br/>\n* Determine potential and kinetic energy<br/>\n* Calculate the wavelength of sounds and radio signals<br/>\n* Understand visible light interference patterns<br/>\n* Calculate the energy and frequency of a moving particle<br/>\n* Understand atomic structure<br/>\n* Learn about electric current, voltage, resistance, power, and <br/>\nenergy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7603095,"authorName":"Jen R.","from":"&quot;Jen R.&quot; &lt;xochitl24@...&gt;","profile":"xochitl24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Kinesthetic/Random-Abstract","postDate":"1098992930","msgId":100890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDI4MTk0ODUwLjIzNDgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwNDAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNscmdvaituNmhqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":100888,"nextInTopic":100898,"prevInTime":100889,"nextInTime":100891,"topicId":100874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I like this book (for me) Calculus Lite (Third Edition) by Frank Morgan Book Description Calculus Lite breaks the mold of heavyweight calculus books and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1669597218\">I like this book (for me)  <br/>\n <br/>\nCalculus Lite (Third Edition)<br/>\nby Frank Morgan <br/>\n<br/>\nBook Description<br/>\nCalculus Lite breaks the mold of heavyweight calculus books and presents a straightforward introduction to calculus. The author uses an intuitive approach to explain real world problems and then develops a rigorous mathematical treatment for their solution. Standard preliminary topics like trigonometry and limits are introduced by using them in context. This book can serve as an excellent tutorial for self-study and exam preparation. It is also currently being used as a text for beginning courses at major universities and colleges. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
