But, my 2 <br/>\nsisters, AND my mother and I, often ended up laughing and &quot;carrying on&quot; during <br/>\ndinner.  Mom would stifle a giggle and try to act like she wasnt in on the fun..  <br/>\nBut, we would keep on and on til we were all dying out belly laughing ( <br/>\nincluding Mom)  Daddy would get mad shove himself away from the table and storm into <br/>\nthe living room.  Then we would REALLY get to rolling laughing, and he would <br/>\nsulk in the living room til we finally wound down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   Every time we went out to eat, we would get a &quot;warning talk&quot; from Daddy.. <br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t you girls go in here  and act up, now, ya hear?&quot;  Of course, that only <br/>\nserved as fuel to make us loud and giggly.  Daddy would give us an evil eye <br/>\nand lean in and whisper to us.. &quot;Everybody knows your here&quot;.    My sisters and <br/>\nMom and I still  use this line when we go out with just &quot;the girls&quot; and we get <br/>\nloud and rowdy.. &quot;Alright now, everybody knows you&#39;re here&quot;  LMBO.. As <br/>\nchildren, we might say, &quot; I&#39;m thirsty, I want something to drink&quot;, Daddy&#39;s solution:  <br/>\n&quot;Get in there and hook your lip around that spigot&quot;.  We would plead,   <br/>\n&quot;Daddy, we&#39;re hungry, let&#39;s stop to get something to eat&quot;  ( on a long road trip <br/>\nback from Grandma&#39;s).  Daddy replies,  &quot;I&#39;m gonna take you to a restaurant, you <br/>\ncan get something real good to eat&quot;  We are so excited,  &quot;Yay, yay, where is <br/>\nit? when are we stopping?&quot;   Daddy&#39;s answer, &quot;We&#39;re going to Banner&#39;s <br/>\nRestaurant, that&#39;s where we are going&quot; ..  Of course, Banners Restaurant was HOME. .. <br/>\nWe went through this &quot;Banner&#39;s Restaurant&quot; scenario almost every time we took a <br/>\nlong road trip.   We really knew he wasn&#39;t going to stop.. BUT, sometimes he <br/>\ndid.stop.  Occasionally, if HE was hungry, he would stop at a restaurant on <br/>\nthe way home from Grandma&#39;s.  And then we got the &quot;you better not act up in <br/>\nhere&quot; talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder, what is the difference that I recall these childhood memories with <br/>\nfondness and affection rather than resentment and hostility towards my Daddy?  <br/>\n I think it&#39;s because for all the &quot;wrong things&quot; my Daddy did, he done many <br/>\ntimes over more &quot;right things&quot;   Thank goodness for that, otherwise, I might <br/>\nhave been scarred for life.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70210,"nextTopicId":69558}}
