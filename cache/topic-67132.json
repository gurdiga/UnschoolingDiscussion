I also have beliefs about spirituality.<br/>\nAs of yet my kids do not share my paganism deep down. They can name deities, know how a circle goes, celebrate the 8 festivals. They are free to choose not to come with me and they are free to explore<br/>\nother faiths. If they choose the pagan path when older that is up to them. I believe spirituality is a personal thing and while we might wave incense around in company or whatever, what goes on<br/>\ninternally is between a person and the universe.<br/>\nWhatever my kids choose I will siuport them 100%. Iif they become conservative evangelicals or choose to follow Islam or join that guy who dresses in orange or go to India  to find a guru. Whatever.
