He and his ex have joint legal custody of the 14yos and 15yos. Both have been &quot;diagnosed&quot; by the schools as being ADD and, therefore, mandated to have Ritalin. The mother is in full support of the course and will not hear of another approach. The young men in question do not want to be drugged and the father supports them. The elder son has flat out refused to take any meds and has weaned himself off but is now miserable living with the school system and the mother. The younger son will not be permitted to attend school in the father&#39;s town without meds unless the mother signs an educational consent form which she will not do. Last year, the father had to pay $650 each month to his school district to allow the younger son to attend school there as a non-resident because the mother would not sign the paper. Apparently, this boy encountered some fairly awful situations while in school in the mother&#39;s town because the father feels that to return there would be life-threatening for the boy. Resultingly, the father and step-mother want to homeschool the 14yos.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe biggest stumbling block in their situation is that the father encounters attorney after attorney, and even the magistrate in charge of his case, who has a son on Ritalin and keeps espousing the benefits.
