My son never lost the Moro reflex (where <br/>\nbabies fling their arms out when startled). As a big kid, this means <br/>\nhe sometimes knocks into things abruptly with his arms if he is <br/>\nsurprised. Also, it means that his body doesn&#39;t uncurl very easily. <br/>\nHe can&#39;t sit upright in a chair, for instance. This makes it hard to <br/>\nplay games on our computer, because he can&#39;t put his feet up on the <br/>\ndesk and simultaneously reach the keyboard. He has to kneel on the <br/>\nchair or somehow get his body into a position that works. Eating is <br/>\nhard too, and food gets dropped on the floor frequently (good thing <br/>\nwe have a dog!) because he can&#39;t sit up straight over his plate (good <br/>\nthing he didn&#39;t grow up in my house, LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, he he had problems with the left-right aspects of his body. His <br/>\nhands have trouble crossing the center line of his body (he used to <br/>\ndraw and write on the left side of the page with his left hand, and <br/>\nthe right side with his right). This makes things like getting <br/>\ndressed tough, because you have to be able to hold your left sleeve <br/>\nwith your right hand and that is incredibly hard for him. It also <br/>\nmakes it hard for him to play some video games - he&#39;s told me that he <br/>\nhas a tough time on games where he has to use his right hand to hit <br/>\nkeys on the left side of the keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, these are all things that are being addressed in vision <br/>\ntherapy, so that basic life skills like eating and getting dressed, <br/>\nas well as stuff like video games, drawing, and writing, are all <br/>\ngetting easier. Much less frustrating for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I&#39;d throw that out in case anyone else has encountered this. <br/>\nI never would&#39;ve thought that all these things are connected, or that <br/>\nthey could be helped with visual and body-patterning exercises.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153142310,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;tri_mom@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: dyslexic?","postDate":"1085323929","msgId":94509,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM4cWRxcCtmNXJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzMjEwMWM0NDBjMSQ4YTA5N2Q0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBNT0xFMjY5MDA+"},"prevInTopic":94506,"nextInTopic":94517,"prevInTime":94508,"nextInTime":94510,"topicId":94304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... was ... being ... muscles in my ...

Our area has many <br/>\nalternative schools and plenty of homeschoolers. It&#39;s considered more <br/>\nor less normal here for a child not to be in the regular ol&#39; public <br/>\nschool. Of the 25 kids in our immediate neighborhood, less than 10 go <br/>\nto the public school that is in our area. I&#39;m sure that colors not <br/>\nonly the perceptions of parents, but of experts that these parents <br/>\nmight or might not choose to go to. People her are pretty used to <br/>\ndiffering educational choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What perentage of all the experts in the world are your vision <br/>\n </span></blockquote>therapists?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Your exception doesn&#39;t disprove my generality.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, perhaps not. Though I&#39;m not convinced that your generality is <br/>\naccurate either. I know more than a few homeschoolers who have used <br/>\ntherapists of one stripe or another - OTs (occupational therapists), <br/>\nvision therapists, language therapists, etc. and none of them have <br/>\nencountered the attitude that you paint here. I think most therapists <br/>\nare in the game to help kids, and I think more than a few of them <br/>\nrecognize that homeschooling families are going out of their way to <br/>\nprovide the best possible environment for these kids. Most of them <br/>\nare also pretty familiar with what kids who are &quot;different&quot; encounter <br/>\nin the school system - from teasing and bullying to labeling and <br/>\nbeing considered &quot;behind&quot; in the system. They can see first-hand the <br/>\nadvantages of homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I think it&#39;s wrong to tell another parent to avoid a specialist <br/>\n </span></blockquote>who <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; might help their child, just based on the (often mistaken) belief <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; that all specialists are label-loving homeschool-haters.

She listed specific vision <br/>\nareas that he was having trouble with and discussed seeing an <br/>\noptemetrist and a vision therapist. The title of the post was a bit <br/>\nmisleading, but other than that, I didn&#39;t see this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;For one thing, dyslexic kids can and DO figure out <br/>\n&gt; how to deal with their own perceptions. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That may or may not be true. Some do, some that I&#39;ve known never do. <br/>\nRegardless, vision problems are not the same as dyslexia. A vision <br/>\ntherapist is not the same thing as a reading therapist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Unschoolers don&#39;t need that label.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And from the description of the problem in that one first post, it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>neither <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; seemed like dyslexia NOR like a problem that needed professional <br/>\n </span></blockquote>help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I have to disagree. When someone says &quot;his eyes don&#39;t track <br/>\nwell together and he has some vision problems&quot;, that sounds like a <br/>\nproblem that might just need professional help, to me at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kids don&#39;t decide they &quot;don&#39;t want to&quot; read at eight, unless at <br/>\n </span></blockquote>five, six and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; seven someone was trying to force them to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I disagree. I know plenty of unschoolers who were just uninterested, <br/>\nand had their parents read to them until they *were* interested. Just <br/>\nlike some kids aren&#39;t interested in riding bicycles, painting <br/>\npictures, or doing other things at that age. It&#39;s not a big deal <br/>\nuntil someone makes it a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kids who don&#39;t read early aren&#39;t ready to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless they are ready to do it and vision problems are stopping them. <br/>\nMy son loves to read, wants to read, and can read anything if the <br/>\ntext is big enough. What frustrates him is that he *wants* to read <br/>\nbooks like Harry Potter (and yes, I&#39;ve read them to him and continue <br/>\nto do so, but he wants to read them himself) but he can&#39;t because the <br/>\ntext is small, his eyes don&#39;t track, he gets blurred and doubled <br/>\nvision and his head hurts after 3 or 4 minutes. Heck, if my head hurt <br/>\nafter 3 minutes of reading I&#39;d be mightily upset as I love to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;Wanting&quot; to read at eight with or without clear vision isn&#39;t going <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what causes reading to kick in. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wanting and being able to read large print words, but not being able <br/>\nto read closely spaced or smaller print words is a far cry from what <br/>\nyou&#39;re talking about (not being ready to read or not being interested <br/>\nin reading). If a child&#39;s brain is totally ready to read and *can* <br/>\nread words that are far spaced and big, they&#39;re reading but just <br/>\nunable to process a book. I see that as a totally different thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  For little kids, most tiny print is blurry.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All the letters look the same to kids at some point.  When that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>changes is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; different from child to child.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And for some kids it never changes, if their eyes don&#39;t work right. <br/>\nI&#39;ve met more than a few adults who have this problem and it&#39;s much <br/>\nharder to fix at age 35 or 40, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My kids didn&#39;t learn to read with large-print beginner books.  They <br/>\n </span></blockquote>learned <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from regular small print, and even TINY print (Holly, Harry Potter <br/>\n </span></blockquote>cards were <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her first real reading).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bully for your kids. I&#39;m glad that their eyes work well enough to do <br/>\nso. My son could read Harry Potter books if the print was big enough <br/>\nto take up the living room wall, but he can&#39;t read them if the print <br/>\nis tiny. He&#39;s more than ecstatic that after some therapy, his eyes <br/>\nare working well enough to let him see smaller and smaller print.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I run into things I don&#39;t see becuase I don&#39;t look sometimes.  I&#39;ve <br/>\n </span></blockquote>closed my <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; left hand in a drawer with my right hand half a dozen times in my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>life.

Something that&#39;s always been there.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I&#39;m glad to hear that your vision works well enough for this <br/>\nnot to be an hourly or daily problem for you, but a half-a-dozen-<br/>\ntimes-in-a-life problem. For someone with vision problems, this stuff <br/>\nhappens on a minute-by-minute basis. Again, I&#39;m glad that my son <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to live with that forever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this seems to me like saying to a person in a <br/>\nwheelchair &quot;Well, a few times in my life, my legs have gone to sleep <br/>\nand when I tried to stand up, they didn&#39;t work. But hey, *I* don&#39;t <br/>\nneed a wheelchair to get around.&quot; It&#39;s apples and oranges. Your eyes <br/>\nwork well, you have very occasional problems where you run into <br/>\nthings because you aren&#39;t paying attention. My son&#39;s eyes don&#39;t work <br/>\nwell, he frequently does things like run into doorways, walls, car <br/>\ndoors, etc.  This winter, he ran into a doorway hard enough to knock <br/>\nhimself out. I don&#39;t see any reason why he needs to live with poor <br/>\nvision just because other people might have these kinds of problems <br/>\noccasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Holly&#39;s running into things lately and banging her elbow and her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>head.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s because she&#39;s getting tall fast, and she forgets where the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>new ends of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; herself are.  That is absolutely normal.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right. Apples and oranges. It&#39;s normal for her. I have one normal kid <br/>\ntoo. Her eyes work fine, she gets the occasional bumps and bruises. <br/>\nPerhaps if all my kids were like her, I wouldn&#39;t understand vision <br/>\nissues either. But my son is another case entirely, he&#39;s not like <br/>\nher, his eyes don&#39;t work like hers, and I&#39;m glad that there&#39;s a way <br/>\nto help his eyes change so that they work together. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Based on the original account and the experiences of lots and lots <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unschooling families, I don&#39;t think my simple suggestion for them <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to stall on getting <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; professional help was worth you getting this worked up about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I understand that you feel that way. I hold a different <br/>\nopinion. I think to tell a family that their child is perfectly fine <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t need help based on one email is at best irresponsible. <br/>\nI&#39;m &quot;worked up about it&quot; as you say, because I can see the difference <br/>\nthat vision therapy has made in my kid&#39;s life. It&#39;s very near and <br/>\ndear to my heart right now. I get equally &quot;worked up&quot; about <br/>\nunschooling, as do many people on this list, because we can see how <br/>\nbig a difference it makes in children&#39;s lives. And when people slag <br/>\nunschooling, especially people who don&#39;t know anything about it, it&#39;s <br/>\nworth getting &quot;worked up&quot; about to let people know. I feel the same <br/>\nway about the vision therapy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You countered the advice with a story of your own.

I still disagree, but I see a bit where <br/>\nyou&#39;re coming from. I&#39;m not trying to hound you or make you feel <br/>\nguilty, but I do feel that your advice was wrong, and I think it&#39;s <br/>\nimportant enough to counter it (as you do so many times with people&#39;s <br/>\nunschooling advice, for largely the same reasons).  I hope this list <br/>\nwill always be a place where people get to see more than one side of <br/>\nunschooling, more than one family&#39;s vision. My family are <br/>\nunschoolers, we love everything about it.

So often, it seems, folks think the best way to get any kind of special help is thru the public schools, because after all it&#39;s free and the &#39;experts&#39; have been chosen by the school.  For people who think school is a good place and that the education folks have a child&#39;s best interest at heart don&#39;t seem to understand why anyone would decline a free service offered by the local free schools.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when Will was in public school and I agreed to have him tested for learning disabilities.  When it was determined he was &#39;normal&#39; I actually had teachers encourage me to challenge the findings and insist on more testing until they could find his problems.  These people genuinely believed the only way to help my son was to keep fighting for more services.  Sure, some of that may have been to make their own jobs easier (since it would have gotten him out of their classroom for a part of each day) but a few were sincerely convinced it would help Will.  They were just baffled when I was happy with the finding that he had no disabilities and chose not to fight for services.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a mindset among some specialists and therapists that more intervention is better -- always.  And that the only reason parents would declind more intervention is to save money, or because they can&#39;t afford the best for their child.  They see the public school programs as a way to meet that child&#39;s need, and don&#39;t understand a parent who doesn&#39;t want the state&#39;s involvement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that vision problems are about more than one&#39;s ability to read, and when they&#39;re causing a child problems (even if it&#39;s just that he wants to read but can&#39;t) treatment should be sought.  I&#39;m also not surprised when I hear that a therapist or expert strongly pushed public school and discouraged homeschool.  There seems to be a perception that parents who don&#39;t avail themselves of every program are either negligent or in denial about their child&#39;s challenges.  That, and it devalues everything they&#39;ve worked for to have a parent tell them aren&#39;t needed after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

In fact, the <br/>\nschools aren&#39;t all that experienced with vision therapy, and the <br/>\ntherapists often have to fight like heck to get kids the help they <br/>\nneed with their vision. Schools mainly label kids with vision <br/>\nproblems as having &quot;attention deficits&quot; and try to go the medication <br/>\nroute, which does no good. Lots of the literature out there on vision <br/>\ntherapy talks about the struggles that vision therapists have in <br/>\ntrying to help kids in school situations. My experience has been that <br/>\nthe vision therapists we&#39;ve met have made a career out of helping <br/>\nkids and adults see better, and that&#39;s what makes these people tick. <br/>\nThey&#39;ve all been super sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And experts tend toward suggesting that <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling isn&#39;t good for children with special needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Really?

Our other therapist lives 3 doors down from us. Her husband <br/>\nteaches higher math to homeschooled kids who want it. He says he <br/>\nloves homeschoolers because they come to him eager to learn and know, <br/>\nand it&#39;s a mile different than teaching kids who don&#39;t care.

What if there was a very simple therapy that would <br/>\nlet that child walk within a few months?? Would it be a good idea to <br/>\ntell that child that they were just fine the way they were? <br/>\nWouldn&#39;t the child know, without anyone telling them, that there were <br/>\nthings that they could not do that other kids could do, that other <br/>\nkids were running and jumping while they were sitting in a <br/>\nwheelchair? Would that be just okay, for that child? Somehow, I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink so. And I think the situation is directly analagous. My son <br/>\nknew that things weren&#39;t working right for him, that there were <br/>\nthings *he* wanted to do that he could not. Who am I to tell him that <br/>\nhe is just okay, for him??

My son will be 8 this summer and we&#39;ve always unschooled. He sounds remarkably similar to your son, and actually is in the middle of vision therapy right now. I have to say that I *strongly* disagree with the advice to cancel the appointment with the vision therapist. If something physical on a child doesn&#39;t work the way it&#39;s supposed to (let&#39;s say, for instance, that your child&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t coordinate so that he couldn&#39;t walk), I can&#39;t imagine thinking that it would be a good idea to just cancel any appointments with specialists and tell him it&#39;s just fine to drag himself around on his arms until things come together in his brain so that his legs work together the way they&#39;re supposed to. If a child&#39;s eyes don&#39;t work in tandem, more than just reading is at stake. Their whole visual perception of the world can be skewed. They have no depth perception, they run into walls, doors, they stub and break toes, they crash bicycles and scooters (or give up in frustration before they can&#39;t ride them). IMHO, there&#39;s no reason to let a child hobble on in a world that feels difficult and frustrating to them when something as painless and simple as vision therapy can make everything work well and easily. Vision therapists are masters at making therapy fun for the kids. Ours sends my son home with Pokemon-themed exercises and &quot;Where&#39;s Waldo&quot; books. They change his exercises up every week and he is amazed and happy at how much easier not only reading, but *all of life* is for him now that he&#39;s been doing therapy for a couple of months. Just this week, he has discovered that he can now make his hand and eye do what his brain imagines and he can draw Pokemon characters. He was actually shouting out loud &quot;Mom, I can draw a straight line! Mom, a straight line!!!&quot; Please note, I&#39;ve never asked him to draw a straight line in his life, but he really wants to draw Pokemon characters and before the vision therapy, he couldn&#39;t make his hand and eyes work together to draw what he was seeing in his head.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">       &gt;&quot;He also is very impulsive or&quot;clumsy&quot; as he<br/>\n      &gt;calls it. The other day he flung a door open on our truck right into another<br/>\n      &gt;car so we&#39;ll be paying for that.(I know this was just an accident but this is<br/>\n      &gt;just a good example of the type of things he does. He saw the car and then just<br/>\n      &gt;flung the door open without considering the distance at all) Walks on things,<br/>\n      &gt;into things, you get the idea. He ask me the other day why he was so &quot;clumsy&quot;<br/>\n      &gt;(we don&#39;t tell him this, I don&#39;t know where he<br/>\n      &gt;got it).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>      He knows. I knew it as a kid too. I sure wish I knew then that there was a relatively easy solution for it. I&#39;ve broken so many toes and banged my head into things so many times I can&#39;t count. My parents were baffled at why I was so clumsy. It&#39;s wonderful to watch my son&#39;s body come together as the brain-vision-body connection is strengthened through therapy. He can actually run in a straight line now (he used to go semi-sideways, one reason he always ran into things or into other people), he can skip and hop (and no, for those who might be wondering, we never asked him to do those either, but he knew that other kids can do things that he can&#39;t, and he&#39;s ecstatic now that he can join in riding scooters or jumping rope).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">       &gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, he is a great kid. He is very<br/>\n      &gt;smart, gets very involved in whatever his interest at the time may be. The<br/>\n      &gt;school he was at also suggested that he was also gifted(another label!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>      Well, that&#39;s the great thing about unschooling, you just don&#39;t have to worry about all those labels. It&#39;s very freeing. But still, a child can face problems, with or without a label. And helping them through challenges that confront them is part of being an unschooling parent, to me. Whether it&#39;s getting them to the library and helping them find a book or video about a subject that they&#39;re interested in, or helping them find a way to make their eyes work in a coordinated pair, I guess I just don&#39;t see it as all that different. With unschooling, they can just be who and what they are, and we can help them with what they might need help with, and not have to bother about the label that someone might come up with that might or might not fit all or part of who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">        &gt; He likes older kids to hang out with usually, although<br/>\n      &gt;thankfully with home schooling this isn&#39;t a big deal anymore. But impulse<br/>\n      &gt;control can be really hard for him and sometimes this leads to problems with<br/>\n      &gt;other kids. We just let him be himself and focus on the things he does well.<br/>\n      &gt;This has helped his self-esteem enormously but sometimes I wonder if I should be<br/>\n      &gt;doing more! Has anyone heard of vision training helping<br/>\n      &gt;these kind of things? From what I&#39;ve read it seems like it can but if this is<br/>\n      &gt;dyslexia or dysgraphia should we be getting him more help? What&#39;s the<br/>\n      &gt;unschooling perspective on these things? Thanks for reading.<br/>\n      &gt;Linda<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>      I think every unschooler will probably have a different perspective on this. The important thing, IMHO is to find what works, really works, for you and your child. It&#39;s more important than a label, more important even than the label of &quot;unschooler&quot;. To me, to my son, to our family, vision therapy has worked well within an unschooling perspective. It&#39;s something that my son noticed, something that he asked for help with, and thankfully something that we found a great resource that was able to give him that help. Our vision therapist is actually a neighbor, a wonderful woman that our son was already comfortable with. The therapists go out of their way to find fun and engaging activities for him to do, both at the office visits and at home. We&#39;re only 10 weeks into a 30-week course of therapy, but we had a midway checkup yesterday and his vision is so vastly improved, it&#39;s amazing. Things that were blurry to him before are now clear. Things that he wanted his body to do before, he can now do. Every day almost there is something new that he discovers that he can do, and he&#39;s so excited about it, it&#39;s almost like when he was 2 years old again. Not having been in school, he didn&#39;t have to go through any comparison with his age peers, but all the same he had started noticing that there were things *he* wanted to do that he couldn&#39;t, and it wasn&#39;t getting any better. Just this week, he discovered he could read the tiny print on Pokemon cards, could draw straight lines, could ride a scooter without tipping sideways. Just leaps and bounds here.<br/>\n<br/>\n      I actually just finished writing an article about our experiences with deciding to pursue vision therapy and how we thought about that interacting with our family&#39;s unschooling lifestyle. Making the decision was a journey that required a lot of thought on our part - about what the implications could be, both positive and negative. So far, for our son, the decision seems to have been unilaterally positive. Since making this decision, I&#39;ve met several adults who struggled with vision issues until they got therapy as an adult. All of them said without a doubt that they&#39;d wished that they&#39;d had it available to them as children, since they&#39;ve gone through decades of seeing double, running into walls, not being able to read well, being turned down for pilot&#39;s licenses, and other issues where their vision held them back from the things that they wanted to do in life. <br/>\n<br/>\n      If you feel like discussing our experiences personally, feel free to email me: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tri_mom@...\">tri_mom@...</a> . It has really been such a positive thing in our son&#39;s life to have done this, and it has interfered not at all with his usual unschooling enthusiasm for life.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Blue Skies,<br/>\n      -Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] dyslexic?","postDate":"1085148355","msgId":94397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTIxMTQwNTU1LjU4ODQ4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNzA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDIwMWM0M2VjMSQxYTJlYzcyMCQ3YTRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":94354,"nextInTopic":94415,"prevInTime":94396,"nextInTime":94398,"topicId":94304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A book I found helpful was The Out of Sync Child, Carol Stock Kranowitz.

My name is Linda and I&#39;ve only posted once so far.  I have an<br/>\nissue I could use some feed back on.  My oldest, Logan, is eight right<br/>\nnow,we pulled him out of public school at the beginning of last year.  He<br/>\nhad already been labeled  &quot;learning disabled with possible attention<br/>\nissues&quot;.  I had tried the &quot;school at home&quot; and we were both miserable.<br/>\nThat&#39;s when I found John Holt&#39;s books.  Absolutely amazing man, wish I could<br/>\nhave met him!  So now we try to follow the unschooling philosophy ,although<br/>\nI&#39;m still new and probably screw up a lot!  Anyway here&#39;s the thing, Logan<br/>\nis still having tons of trouble with writing and small motor skills are<br/>\nreally tough for him(like cutting, spreading peanut butter, etc...)  He<br/>\nreverses all the letters, often having them facing different directions on<br/>\nthe same page and writing is very hard for him.  His writing is also very<br/>\nhard to read,even for him.  He&#39;s a good reader (reads young adult books)<br/>\nbut, avoids books with small print like the<br/>\n&gt;  plague.  I DO NOT make a big deal out out of this, I don&#39;t even mention<br/>\nit, but he does.  It does frustrate him that these things seem to come so<br/>\neasy to his six year old brother and he has to struggle so hard.

His vision is 20/20,it&#39;s more the way his eyes work together<br/>\nwith his brain, I guess. We have another appt. next week so I should learn<br/>\nmore then.  I found a great website on this HTTP://www.pavevision.org .  He<br/>\nalso is very impulsive or&quot;clumsy&quot; as he calls it.

He saw the car and then just flung the door open without<br/>\nconsidering the distance at all)  Walks on things, into things, you get the<br/>\nidea. He ask me the other day why he was so &quot;clumsy&quot; (we don&#39;t tell him<br/>\nthis, I don&#39;t know  where he<br/>\n&gt;  got it).  We just try to tell him to pay more attention to what he&#39;s<br/>\ndoing.  It&#39;s kind of like he has no spacial perception, which is one of the<br/>\nthings they had said at the school too.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, he is a great<br/>\nkid.  He is very smart, gets very involved in whatever his interest at the<br/>\ntime may be.  The school he was at also suggested that he was also<br/>\ngifted(another label!)  in science and social studies, he had scored way<br/>\nabove grade level.

What did the people telling me this mean? Look harder at what I was supposed to be paying attention to? Just move slower? <br/>\n  There&#39;s no moment between the thought and the action to stop and pay attention. It&#39;s like telling a kid who&#39;s walking from one pasture to the next to mind the fence, meanwhile the child can&#39;t see the fence and doesn&#39;t even know it&#39;s there. I&#39;m not sure what to do about it but I&#39;d suggest you maybe do some reading on ADHD and such, NOT because your son might have it but simply because some books have some good advice for helping a person with impulse control problems.  I know I&#39;ve managed to work out a lot of issues regarding impulse control but for a very long time it meant a LOT of work to stop when impulse struck, a constant internal dialogue that I would not do whatever I was about to do (lots of focus needed there, a distraction would mean all that dialogue was forgotten). Most importantly and probably hardest was learning to recognize those impulses in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175209246,"authorName":"Linda Johnson","from":"Linda Johnson &lt;linj777@...&gt;","profile":"linj777","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"dyslexic?","postDate":"1085014863","msgId":94304,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTIwMDEwMTAzLjgzMDUwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjExOTA1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94313,"prevInTime":94303,"nextInTime":94305,"topicId":94304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All.

I have an issue I could use some feed back on.  My oldest, Logan, is eight right now,we pulled him out of public school at the beginning of last year.  He had already been labeled  &quot;learning disabled with possible attention issues&quot;.  I had tried the &quot;school at home&quot; and we were both miserable.  That&#39;s when I found John Holt&#39;s books.  Absolutely amazing man, wish I could have met him!  So now we try to follow the unschooling philosophy ,although I&#39;m still new and probably screw up a lot!  Anyway here&#39;s the thing, Logan is still having tons of trouble with writing and small motor skills are really tough for him(like cutting, spreading peanut butter, etc...)  He reverses all the letters, often having them facing different directions on the same page and writing is very hard for him.  His writing is also very hard to read,even for him.  He&#39;s a good reader (reads young adult books) but, avoids books with small print like the<br/>\n plague.  I DO NOT make a big deal out out of this, I don&#39;t even mention it, but he does.  It does frustrate him that these things seem to come so easy to his six year old brother and he has to struggle so hard.  We did find out that his eyes don&#39;t track well together and he has some vision problems.   His vision is 20/20,it&#39;s more the way his eyes work together with his brain, I guess. We have another appt. next week so I should learn more then.  I found a great website on this HTTP://www.pavevision.org .  He also is very impulsive or&quot;clumsy&quot; as he calls it.  The other day he flung a door open on our truck right into another car so we&#39;ll be paying for that.(I know this was just an accident but this is just a good example of the type of things he does.  He saw the car and then just flung the door open without considering the distance at all)  Walks on things, into things, you get the idea. He ask me the other day why he was so &quot;clumsy&quot; (we don&#39;t tell him this, I don&#39;t know  where he<br/>\n got it).  We just try to tell him to pay more attention to what he&#39;s doing.  It&#39;s kind of like he has no spacial perception, which is one of the things they had said at the school too.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, he is a great kid.  He is very smart, gets very involved in whatever his interest at the time may be.  The school he was at also suggested that he was also gifted(another label!)  in science and social studies, he had scored way above grade level.  He&#39;s extremely lovable,still loves to cuddle!  In some ways, when you talk to him, he comes across older then he is.  He likes older kids to hang out with usually, although thankfully with home schooling this isn&#39;t a big deal anymore.  But impulse control can be really hard for him and sometimes this leads to problems with other kids.  We just let him be himself and focus on the things he does well.  This has helped his self-esteem enormously but sometimes I wonder if I should be doing more!  Has anyone heard of vision training helping<br/>\n these kind of things?  From what I&#39;ve read it seems like it can but if this is dyslexia or dysgraphia should we be getting him more help?  What&#39;s the unschooling perspective on these things?
