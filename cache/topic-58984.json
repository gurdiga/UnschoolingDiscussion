I guess that <br/>\nsounds flippant, but it&#39;s really the only way I can explain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI provide him with lots of textured materials, because he&#39;s a tactile <br/>\nlearner (he&#39;s vision impaired); I give him a safe place with lots of <br/>\nthings to explore...poke his fingers into, push over, taste, hear, <br/>\nsmell, etc.  I am with him, talking to him, telling him what he&#39;s <br/>\nfeeling, what he&#39;s seeing, what he&#39;s hearing...keeping him safe; <br/>\nhelping him crawl up onto the couch so he can touch the cold <br/>\nwindowpane, and I tell him about winter, pointing out the clingy <br/>\nsnowflakes I had put there another day that he can peel off; he <br/>\ncrawls over to the piano and pats the leg - his sign for me to lift <br/>\nhim up so he can *play* the piano...and I talk about what beautiful <br/>\nmusic he makes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI make books for him because book publishers don&#39;t cater to the small <br/>\nmarket of kids with vision impairment; but he loves books and he <br/>\ndeserves to have books to enjoy.  If he wants to spend an entire day <br/>\ngoing through his &quot;books&quot;, then that&#39;s what we do; if he wants to <br/>\nspend the day in his specially-designed swing listening to his &quot;Best <br/>\nof Sesame Street&quot; CD, then that&#39;s what we do.  My job is to provide <br/>\nan environment that supports learning; he does the learning himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am there with him, giving him whatever help or information he needs <br/>\nto make sense of his world, and along the way he learns that he&#39;s <br/>\nvalued as a human being, he&#39;s loved, he&#39;s respected.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for Kevin, unschooling doesn&#39;t fit into his life...it IS his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy understanding of this gradually changed the way my other children <br/>\nhomeschool.  Unschooling Kevin came so naturally to me, because my <br/>\nonly expectation for him was to be happy.  It hasn&#39;t been so easy for <br/>\nme to let go of expectations for my other kids...but we&#39;re getting <br/>\nthere...thanks to Kevin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you understand unschooling in a family loving a <br/>\nchild with severe multiple disabilities...who also has a gorgeous <br/>\nsmile, an infectious belly-laugh, and the heart of a hero in a frail <br/>\nbody.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling, what a concept!","postDate":"1045332473","msgId":58984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzLjNhNWRiMmQ3LjJiN2ZkYmY5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59047,"prevInTime":58983,"nextInTime":58985,"topicId":58984,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/15/03 12:42:34 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...

She&#39;s moaning and flailing <br/>\n&gt; like she&#39;s possessed. I&#39;ve tried all my loving, caring and understanding <br/>\n&gt; ways. I&#39;ve tried hugging and distracting and reasoning and breathing <br/>\n&gt; suggestions. I&#39;ve tried moving her and letting her be. It&#39;s not working. <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a pain in her soul right now that I cannot seem to reach. As a <br/>\n&gt; mother, this is very hard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But it&#39;s not the unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess we&#39;re all just going to ride this one out till she&#39;s exhausted. So <br/>\n&gt; hard. After it&#39;s over I&#39;ll try again to connect with her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, yes, I understand extremes. I just try VERY hard to not let her <br/>\n&gt; emotions <br/>\n&gt; become my emotions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Life is good.<br/>\n&gt; ~Mary<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, Mary, been there done that.. I feel ya, girl.  Sometimes you can&#39;t even <br/>\nhold them because they are flailing, kicking and resisting so much. <br/>\n<br/>\n   You know, my boys have been &quot;like this&quot; since they were born. .NOT just <br/>\nsince we started unschooling.    I sometimes find it confusing figuring out <br/>\nhow unschooling &quot;works&quot; or fits into our lives with kids who have special <br/>\nneeds.  I dont know how the idea got planted that I blame unschooling for my <br/>\nkids behavior.. Or that I dont think it can work for my kids. Or that I am <br/>\nagainst unschooling or that I dont practice it.   It DOES work for them, but <br/>\nsometimes I have to figure out how to implement it.  Because I have questions <br/>\nand concerns about how to unschool my special needs kids, because what works <br/>\nfor others may not always work for us, does not mean I am not unschooling or <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t condone the approach.   Something has been misread in this <br/>\ninterpretation.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58951,"nextTopicId":59057}}
