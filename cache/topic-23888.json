That is a lot of wine for an adult!  I would<br/>\nbe falling over drunk and then hung over for probably two days<br/>\nafterwards!<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the Am. Acad. of Pediatrics (in case anyone has any faith in<br/>\ntheir opinions) alcohol consumption is compatible with breastfeeding in<br/>\namounts of one or fewer drinks per day.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Alcohol passes freely into mother&#39;s milk and has been found to peak<br/>\nabout 30 to 60 minutes after consumption, 60 to 90 minutes with food<br/>\n(lawton 1985)  Alcohol also passes freely out of a mother&#39;s milk and her<br/>\nsystem.  It takes a 120 pound woman about two to three hours to eliminate<br/>\nfrom her body the alcohol is one serving of beer or wine (Schulte 1995). <br/>\nHowever, the more alcohol is consumed, the longer it takes for it to be<br/>\neliminated.  It takes up to 13 hours for a 120 pound woman to eliminate<br/>\nthe alcohol from one high-alcohol drink [high alcohol was not defined]. <br/>\nThe effects of alcohol on the breastfeeding baby are directly related to<br/>\nthe amount the mother consumes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone else said, this can all vary depending on an individual&#39;s<br/>\nconstitution.  IMO, the bottom line is that it is better to breastfeed<br/>\neven if mom enjoys a drink now and then, but heavy drinkers probably need<br/>\nto think about their parenting.  How can you take care of your child if<br/>\nyou are drunk or hung over?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23772,"nextTopicId":23886}}
