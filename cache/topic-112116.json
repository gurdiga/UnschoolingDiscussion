(One of the things we&#39;re NOT liking about some of the kits we&#39;ve seen online: the vials/containers are plastic... my son just turned his nose up at that part! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now my kids are having a blast with their new Lego bionicles... another mini-obsession around here... <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJessica</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111978,"nextTopicId":112101}}
