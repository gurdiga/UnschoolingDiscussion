I don&#39;t understand why people are getting all <br/>\nruffled about the debates. It&#39;s like watching a heated talk show and then <br/>\ncomplaining that it&#39;s on tv, yet tuning in daily. If I don&#39;t want to see it, <br/>\nI turn it off. And as far as someone running a point into the ground, if I <br/>\nfeel strongly on a certain point I may do that myself. If I feel strongly <br/>\nabout something, and I&#39;m in a free forum for exchanging viewpoints, I&#39;ll go <br/>\non for as long as people wili listen. I mean if anyone hear had the open ear <br/>\nof a structured homeschooler wouldn&#39;t they get in as many points as they were <br/>\nallowed? I don&#39;t understand why some people want to stop certain topics and <br/>\ndebates. If you don&#39;t want in them, don&#39;t read them. But the people debating <br/>\nobviously have something to iron out, I say leave them to it. When they&#39;re <br/>\nall done, they&#39;ll quit. If you&#39;re fed up with the debate, drop out and don&#39;t <br/>\nread them. It almost seems borderline censorship to me, saying what can and <br/>\ncan&#39;t be talked about. Just my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24094,"nextTopicId":24006}}
