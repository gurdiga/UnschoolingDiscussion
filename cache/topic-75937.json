I think mine may have been in our P.O. box for a few days before we even got them.  Though they seemed like they were dying after having been in the fridge for ten min. (booklet advised this to keep them from moving too quickly when you put them in the farm) they all revived.  All fifteen or so are alive and tunneling and it soo neat.

I&#39;m too cheap to<br/>\nbuy one and figure I can&#39;t take it back to the U.S. when we return from our<br/>\ncurrent tour of Germany (dh is army).  So can you make your own ant farm?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have to have a queen to do this, or will just a bunch of worker ants<br/>\ncollected off the groud do?  And what sort of container would I use?  Food?<br/>\nRight now my son is collecting ants in a plastic ziplock tub, which was<br/>\ncheap enough that I didnt&#39; mind punching holes in the top.  But it&#39;s pretty<br/>\nsmall in my mind! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m open to ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 2<br/>\n    Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2003 16:47:29 EDT<br/>\n    From: NarigonC@...<br/>\nSubject: Ant Farms<br/>\n<br/>\nI put &lt;ant farm make own -alien&gt; into Google and here are some ideas I found.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a website that tells how to make your own ant farm: &lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;http://www.homeschoolwiththeweb.com/antfarm.htm&quot;&gt;<br/>\nhttp://www.homeschoolwiththeweb.com/antfarm.htm&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one with good pictures and directions for making your own:<br/>\n&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Tower/4636/antz.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Tower/4636/antz.htm&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a cool site with a bazillion recipes and crafts, including an ant<br/>\nfarm:<br/>\n&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;http://www.essortment.com/in/Crafts.Craft.Recipes/&quot;&gt;http://www.essortment.com/in/Crafts.Craft.Recipes/&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one is for the truly interested ant farmer, not the novice:<br/>\n&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;http://www.antcam.com/antfarm/howtobuild/&quot;&gt;http://www.antcam.com/antfarm/howtobuild/&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA unit study on ants:<br/>\n&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;http://www.themeunits.com/Ants_bk.html&quot;&gt;http://www.themeunits.com/Ants_bk.html&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA sarcastic essay from Onion about what kids can learn from an ant farm<br/>\n(caution, this site is not for sissies):<br/>\n&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/onion3621/ant_farm.html&quot;&gt;http://www.theonion.com/onion3621/ant_farm.html&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA kid-friendly site:<br/>\n&lt;A <br/>\nHREF=&quot;http://www.doctorcoughdrop.com/lab.html&quot;&gt;http://www.doctorcoughdrop.com/lab.html&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLast one, with lots of good info on ants:<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.antcolony.org&quot;&gt;http://www.antcolony.org&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\nwww.home-ed-magazine.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70316959,"authorName":"AimeeL73@cs.com","from":"AimeeL73@...","profile":"aimeels73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion]   Ant farms and Newbie list was List Changes and","postDate":"1057154297","msgId":75937,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExYS4yNTRmMTU1NS4yYzM0M2VmOUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75945,"prevInTime":75936,"nextInTime":75938,"topicId":75937,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/1/03 12:42:34 PM Central Daylight Time, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes:  If anyone notices a dearth of experienced unschoolers on there,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-974900733\">In a message dated 7/1/03 12:42:34 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &gt; If anyone notices a dearth of experienced unschoolers on there, and they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; wanna unsubcribe, post on here, and maybe a few of us will subscribe for a <br/>\n &gt; while.  <br/>\n &gt; I volunteer.  <br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n &gt; ~Aimee<br/>\n &gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote> Tag.
