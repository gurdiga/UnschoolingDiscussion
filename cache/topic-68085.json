Now there&#39;s a question.  Well, Anglicans come in several &quot;brands&quot;, for<br/>\nlack of a better word, just like the Baptists do.  So I&#39;ll tell you what my<br/>\nchurch believes, and other Anglicans are likely is pretty much in agreement<br/>\nwith, too.  (Correction: my husband tells me that Church of Scotland is<br/>\nPresbyterian.  A different brand of mainline Christianity.)  But don&#39;t sue<br/>\nme because you can name three Anglicans who don&#39;t believe this, because<br/>\nthat&#39;s the nature of religious faith, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nEpiscopalians (the American version of Anglicans) believe that the Bible is<br/>\nthe history of the people of God.  It was written by people who were<br/>\ninspired by God, but we do not take the Bible literally.  That makes a huge<br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that when I first became Episcopalian, the other thing that struck<br/>\nme as very different than other Protestants is that scripture (the Bible) is<br/>\nseen as an equal partner with tradition and reason.  The image used is a<br/>\nthree-legged stool; scripture is one leg of it only.  It is not the sole<br/>\ndevice by which the church considers issues, problems, etc.; traditions of<br/>\nthe church and our God-given ability to reason out a situation are also<br/>\ngiven an equal place.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously there are worship difference, and such, too, but they&#39;re not<br/>\nnecessarily what you&#39;re asking about here.  But I have been told before, and<br/>\nit&#39;s often implied, that I&#39;m not a &quot;true Christian&quot; because of those types<br/>\nof beliefs.  Hence my sarcastic comment before.  I am truly sorry if what I<br/>\nsaid offended you, it wasn&#39;t my intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68084,"nextTopicId":68089}}
