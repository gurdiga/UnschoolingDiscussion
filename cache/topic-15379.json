I have already sent it out to be published, so <br/>\nplease dont call it your own. I have seen alot of this on the net, no <br/>\nI&#39;m not nuts, well, yes, I am but.....Oh nevermind, heres the story!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son, Jay , was born we received a piggy bank as a gift. As he <br/>\ngrew, he enjoyed putting the spare change he would find into it. He <br/>\nasked me what he was saving for when he was2 and when I told <br/>\nhim &quot;college&quot;, he never questioned it.<br/>\nShortly after we returned from a Cape Cod vacation a year later, Jay <br/>\nwas dropping his pennies in the bank and told me he couldnt wait to <br/>\nhave enough money for cottage.<br/>\n&quot;College&quot;, I corrected.<br/>\n&quot;Whats that?&quot; he asked.<br/>\nI explained to him that college was school you go to after you finish <br/>\nhigh school. The look on his face was priceless as he cried &quot;Oh no! I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go to school! I want to go to the beach!&quot;<br/>\nAll along he had thought he was saving for a cottage at the beach!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t give it much thought at the time, but I guess he has always <br/>\nbeen an unschooler at heart!<br/>\n:)Kerry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15170,"nextTopicId":15367}}
