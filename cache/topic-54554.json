Then <br/>\nyou need a common language.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved math when I was in school, and I even thought I wanted to become <br/>\na physicist, but later on I changed my mind and studied English <br/>\nLiterature instead! Go figure...<br/>\nMy second major was music, which I think has a lot to do with math, but <br/>\nin a very practical way. No need to write divisions on paper, or <br/>\nanything like that. You need to understand the language in order to make <br/>\nmusic or write music so that others can read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s how I see math, as a language. The way it&#39;s taught in <br/>\nschool it is mostly used to separate so-called intelligent kids from <br/>\nso-called dumb ones. It serves the school system and the political <br/>\nagendas in order... Divide and you will conquer. It&#39;s not just math, of <br/>\ncourse, but it&#39;s well intertwined with other values and myths within the <br/>\nsystem.<br/>\n<br/>\nYol<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Lotus Therapeutics -<br/>\nAyurveda, Homeopathy, Yoga & Therapeutic Massage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com\">http://www.bluelotustherapeutics.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDhyanyoga Center of NC -<br/>\nMeditation - Kundalini Maha Yoga<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyc-nc.org\">http://www.dyc-nc.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************<br/>\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
