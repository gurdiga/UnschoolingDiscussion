I<br/>\nthink you can get ideas here and other places and if they sound right for<br/>\nyour child try them.  If they don&#39;t sound right for your child forget it -<br/>\nat least for the time being.  Every child is different and it definitely<br/>\nworks best for me to let my son &quot;be&quot;.  I really have had to train myself to<br/>\n&quot;keep out of his way&quot;.  I have found it helpful to not worry if a particular<br/>\nactivity is teaching him something.  If he enjoys it - he will get what he<br/>\nneeds out of it and then move onto something else.  It something bores him<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t matter how educational it is my son will not learn anything from<br/>\nit.

Fun is good for the child&#39;s mind!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll toys are *educational*, and so is everything else in the world. That is my<br/>\nbasic unschooling philosophy. Toys (as with everything else) are more or less<br/>\ncomplex. For example, the little battery operated toy that makes sounds and<br/>\nlights up is simple, you can only do one thing with it -- push the button and<br/>\nwatch it light up. Although my 2 yog is bored by it (she&#39;s figured it out<br/>\nalready) my 5 mos old thinks its the best thing in the world. He&#39;s bored by the<br/>\nmore complex toys (i.e. a dish set or toilet paper tubes) because he can&#39;t play<br/>\ncomplexly yet. Although the battery operated toy drives me nuts (grandma gift :)<br/>\nit still has value. It is teaching my son that his movements (and very specific<br/>\nmovements at that) cause extrordinary things to happen. Play at every age is<br/>\nvitally important. Just think, if your kids thought of life and learning as play<br/>\nthen everything would be fun, from cleaning the house to going to work to<br/>\nscrubbing the toilet (my dd thinks this is the most fun, she wears fun gloves<br/>\nand since we use baking soda and vinegar to clean everything she can &quot;play&quot; in<br/>\nthe toilet as long as she wants -- its amazing how clean she gets it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even if something appears to be for playing, look beyond and see what the<br/>\nkids are actually doing when they play. If you need help, read something on<br/>\nchild development (not what kids are supposed to be doing, but what skills kids<br/>\nare capable of doing or are concentrating on like fine motor skills in<br/>\ntoddlerhood, or emotional self-regulation in the preschool years) A good author<br/>\nto read Gonzalez-Mena, but there are many others out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Wilkins-Hubley wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Susan Wilkins-Hubley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swclub@...\">swclub@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  hope some of this helps...  sorry it got so long.  btw, if your son<br/>\n&gt; &gt;likes puzzle and brain teasers books, has he ever gotten the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&quot;hilights puzzelmania&quot; books?  i didn&#39;t even know Hilights<br/>\n&gt; &gt;published puzzle books until recently.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No... he doesn&#39;t have any of those.....  can you buy them or see them<br/>\n&gt; online?

Well it didn&#39;t - so here I am :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  My son turned 3 in May and this is one of the same reasons that <br/>\nkeeps shouting &quot;homeschool/unschool&quot; to me.  He is very bright and high <br/>\nin energy with a learning style that is not typically accomodated by <br/>\nthe majority of schools.   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; My question to any of you is.....  is a child who has absolutely NO<br/>\n&gt; attention span and who is conversely brilliant - the child who<br/>\n&gt; thrives without school?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  My personal opinion would be absolutely yes.  first of all, if he <br/>\nbrilliant, he probably doesn&#39;t need an attention span of more than a <br/>\nfew seconds to learn something new.  he&#39;s probably also intelligent <br/>\nenough to realize that &quot;okay, i&#39;ve learned this, no point in wasting <br/>\ntime dwelling on it, time to go learn something else!&quot;  you can go <br/>\nwith that flow while the schools are going to expect him to sit <br/>\ntolerantly while they teach the rest of the students.  and i&#39;m <br/>\ncurious... who&#39;s opinion is it that he has NO attention span?  <br/>\nSterling would appear to also have NO attention span &quot;most&quot; of the <br/>\ntime when in actuality he has a very &quot;multi-tasking&quot; type attention <br/>\nspan.  just because it appears to me that he isn&#39;t paying attention <br/>\nto what i am expecting that he should be paying attention to at that <br/>\nvery instant, doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t paying attention.  He <br/>\nusually has several things going on in that busy little mind.  He&#39;ll <br/>\ncome back several hours later after he&#39;s had a chance to absorb and <br/>\nponder something i was trying to do with him and start asking all <br/>\nsorts of questions or he might say/do something related that makes me <br/>\nrealize he certainly was paying very close attention - and probably <br/>\nwas thoughfully engaged for quite some time!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that this child is the one who<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; will do well as an unschooler, but he has mentioned that he would<br/>\n&gt; LIKE to work in some math books and some brain teasing work books -<br/>\n&gt; so I think I will let him, and encourage him as long as he is happy,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  With Sterling only 3 yo, learning about &quot;unschooling&quot; just made me <br/>\nrealize the name for what i had been doing all along.  doing, doing, <br/>\ndoing...  following his cues and giving him the resources to be more <br/>\ninvolved in those things that he showed an obvious interest in.  <br/>\nThose resources range from going to places to see and do more on the <br/>\nsubject, interrelating it with our every day activities in and around <br/>\nthe house, the internet (some really great sites out there!), his own <br/>\ncomputer software, videos, educational TV, music, storybooks and<br/>\nyes.... workbooks and puzzle books. <br/>\n To Sterling it&#39;s all part of the fun of playing and &quot;things to do&quot; <br/>\nrather than &quot;school&quot;.  and toys?  oh yes... LOTS!  but toys that have <br/>\nmultiple educational/developmental value.  mindless toys don&#39;t <br/>\nhold his interest for very long.  i mentioned the appearance of NO <br/>\nattention span &quot;most&quot; of the time...  so i also have to mention that <br/>\nthere are times when he gets very obviously focused in learning.  He <br/>\nwill get lost in a jigsaw puzzle, lego&#39;s, and some types of books <br/>\n(mazes, dot-to-dot, etc) and other learning.  he&#39;s very intense so <br/>\nwhen he does get involved with something that challenges him and that <br/>\nhe likes, he can get locked in for quite some time.  We recently did <br/>\na science volcano project.  he thought it was so cool that we had to <br/>\nmake it erupt over and over and over and over (like the energizer <br/>\nbunny, he didn&#39;t want to quit or do anything else most of the day!).  <br/>\nhe even decided we had to build a town around it for the dinosaurs.  <br/>\nand THEN he decided the dinosaurs would die with no water so we had <br/>\nto add a pond by putting blue colored water into a deep jar cover and <br/>\nburying it in sand up to the rim.  How does he know these things is <br/>\nwhat i would like to know!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I am worried that he will become bored without the chaos of the<br/>\n&gt; school environment.....  should this be a concern?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  i saw a couple other posts mention that he would find his own <br/>\nchaos.  i think that is so true.  given a little guidance to <br/>\nencourage his creativity, believe me...  he WILL create his own <br/>\nconstructive chaos.  our family is always in a state of chaos.  <br/>\nbetween all the &quot;work-in-progress&quot; playing that Sterling dreams up <br/>\nand spread throughout the house, special projects, this and that,<br/>\nexternal activities, crammed schedules, etc, etc, etc, there&#39;s plenty <br/>\nof chaos. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Don&#39;t get me<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wrong, I&#39;m committed to having him home and educating him at home,<br/>\n&gt; and I do think it is best for him, but I guess I&#39;m just concerned<br/>\n&gt; hypothetically (again)  :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts are most appreciated !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  hope some of this helps...  sorry it got so long.  btw, if your son <br/>\nlikes puzzle and brain teasers books, has he ever gotten the <br/>\n&quot;hilights puzzelmania&quot; books?  i didn&#39;t even know Hilights <br/>\npublished puzzle books until recently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Susan Wilkins-Hubley","from":"&quot;Susan Wilkins-Hubley&quot; &lt;swclub@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fxM2qXWthjrrR6NjZCYvDU2jXbaCvde86WpSz_mFPN0_3u_tWU71SA5QmRFnpOeYxJV5MXpKDD3hlDZsZqXkSb9p03Nlx7rNFij5y3AGAg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I&#39;m new here","postDate":"934024388","msgId":1782,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNDAuMTc4Mi45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1781,"nextInTopic":1786,"prevInTime":1781,"nextInTime":1783,"topicId":1753,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you, I think I will see if that book is in our library.  :)  I heard a lot about it but no really great testimonials.

It took my kids quite a while.  My 13 year old still <br/>\nspends a lot of time playing,  but from other homeschoolers,  I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned that it&#39;s quite common at this age.  Their bodies are <br/>\nchanging so fast, hormones are running rampant - sometimes it&#39;s all <br/>\nthey can do to just exist.  A long time unschooler told me that this <br/>\nis one of the reasons middle schools don&#39;t introduce new information <br/>\nat this age.  I think you&#39;re on the right track.  I often show <br/>\ninterest in something in front of my son,  or just leave things I <br/>\nthink he might be interested in laying around.  I know of one <br/>\nunschooler that puts interesting posters and reading material in the <br/>\nbathroom.

Sadly a lot of that chaos is the result of<br/>\nunhappy interactions of kids who are little better than prisoners.....taking out<br/>\ntheir frustration on those weaker than themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember,  home extends beyond walls, right out the door,  into the<br/>\nfascinating, exciting, totally engaging world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan Wilkins-Hubley wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Susan Wilkins-Hubley&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:swclub@...\">swclub@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi there,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been on this list for about a month or so, and when I can, I read the<br/>\n&gt; posts with great interest.

Last April I decided<br/>\n&gt; that year would be his last in formal school.  I decided this because I<br/>\n&gt; found that the school and the teachers did not understand my son the way I<br/>\n&gt; do, it was just a matter of his learning style and whether it fit into the<br/>\n&gt; way they did things.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m committed to having him home and<br/>\n&gt; educating him at home, and I do think it is best for him, but I guess I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; just concerned hypothetically (again)  :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any thoughts are most appreciated !<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Warmest Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Susan Wilkins-Hubley - Founder<br/>\n&gt; The Second Wives Club<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nbest wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.

My son has no desire to pay attention <br/>\nto things that don&#39;t interest him.  As far as math books and brain <br/>\nteasers.  We have used these types of things.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean that you can&#39;t use anything, even text books.  Anything can be a <br/>\nresource.  The difference is that the child can decide what to use, <br/>\nwhen and how much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince your son has been in school,  he&#39;ll probably need what we call <br/>\ndeschooling time - time to recover from school and get used to what <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; is for your family.  When we first took my son out of <br/>\nschool at 10,  he worried that he wasn&#39;t doing enough, that he needed <br/>\nto take spelling tests, etc.  I had to work to convince him at the <br/>\nsame time I was reassuring myself that this would work.  Now at 13,  <br/>\nhe never needs reassurance, but sometimes I still do.  Sometimes,  <br/>\nwhen deschooling,  parents become concerned about the  amount of tv <br/>\nwatched, video games played,  and the amount of time spent doing what <br/>\nappears to be nothing.  It passes.  Be patient,  and he&#39;ll find his <br/>\nway back to a genuine love of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1689,"nextTopicId":1820}}
