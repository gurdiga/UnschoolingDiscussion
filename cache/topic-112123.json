Just<br/>\nsomething I picked up at the $1 store one day thinking it might<br/>\ninterest her and looked like something we were capable of doing<br/>\ntogether. If she ever got interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here she was just happily working along not even seeming to need<br/>\nany help and I was thinking; there is no way she can get through that,<br/>\nwe haven&#39;t worked on it, we&#39;ve barely talked about it. There are place<br/>\nvalue issues she is going to run into....<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked me a few questions as she worked and tho I was running the<br/>\nnumbers on a side piece of paper I was careful to just explain what<br/>\nshe asked for only when she asked me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater she went to bed not quite finished with the puzzle tired but<br/>\nfeeling happy and satisfied. The next morning she was right back at it<br/>\nwhen she woke up till she finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching her I was thinking if I had been insisting she work on math<br/>\nin an &#39;appropriate&#39; way based on what a school system or even society<br/>\nwould say I would have no anxiety about what she knew in terms of her<br/>\npicking up a text or workbook to spend some time working in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut would she have the same kind of joy over what she were doing?<br/>\nBased on my own experiences and stories I hear from others I think not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis just renewed my faith in the process of just letting her live<br/>\nand not forcing her to perform and repeat for my benefit under the<br/>\nmistaken idea that it is best for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently she became hooked on the Disney channel.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe used to watch very little TV right up until my parents put a<br/>\nsatellite dish link on the TV in the family room and boom within a few<br/>\nweeks. Yikes lol sigh<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has books, games, puzzles, crafts, friends all kinds of other<br/>\noptions to choose from which we have done for years but TV is suddenly<br/>\njust a top priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been mostly biting my tongue but it is hard to just wait this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one day a few weeks ago I bought a 1000 piece jig saw puzzle and<br/>\nset it up in the room we share. That night long before bed time she<br/>\nshut off the TV and came in to work on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTucking in my surprise I mentioned that it seemed odd for her to be<br/>\naway from the TV during prime time if you will. She explained to me<br/>\nthat she didn&#39;t want to spend all her time watching TV and not have<br/>\nany time to work on the puzzle. I didn&#39;t say anything else to her and<br/>\ncontinued with what I was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a bit later she added &quot;My life doesn&#39;t revolve around TV you know&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI really had to bite my tongue as I laughed inside but it too renewed<br/>\nmy trust in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nTosca & Lenelle (9)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90576071,"authorName":"Name Location get it?","from":"&quot;Name Location get it?&quot; &lt;toscasac@...&gt;","profile":"toscasac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Packing","postDate":"1140259973","msgId":112258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0NnVhNSs4bDVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEVFMTFCQ0E1LTREMzMtNDE1RS1CQzEzLUVCNjJBRkY1Rjc3REBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":112234,"nextInTopic":112259,"prevInTime":112257,"nextInTime":112259,"topicId":112123,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heyas Pam, Thanks for your post.

It was weird for my kids because the sun was so bright  <br/>\nand the sky so clear and blue, but the air was very cold - colder  <br/>\nthan we ever have, here in Southern California. When it is that sunny  <br/>\nand clear here, it is usually reasonably warm, too.

So every time we  <br/>\nleft the house, I picked up some jackets and sweatshirts. I also  <br/>\nlooked at their feet and if they went out wearing flip-flops, I&#39;d  <br/>\ngrab socks and shoes, too.

It is not what she sees<br/>\nherself as doing or wanting to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I love to bake and cook she has always been exposed to all of<br/>\nthat and could have and has joined in in different ways. She&#39;s never<br/>\nshown a serious interest in anything but the finished products :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow all of a sudden she is Julia Childs, Martha or Emril? Leave me<br/>\nalone in the kitchen mom? Just not what I was expecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we entering a new stage of development or is this just a<br/>\nrelationship glitch we have never gotten over? LOL it seems like both<br/>\nthe more I write and think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will give you a non food/kitchen example.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne evening we are headed to the store or must have been a drive<br/>\nthrough because she decides to travel without shoes and I am thinking<br/>\n&quot;riduculous, no no no&quot; but I don&#39;t say anything. As we are out I<br/>\nrealize I want to run into a local store, might have been a sale going<br/>\non or something I forgot we needed, what ever it is I could not<br/>\nbecause she is shoe less. ggggrrrr<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about this and I explain to her how this has inconvenienced us<br/>\nas a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeeks later we are headed to a roller skating rink. She decides to<br/>\nwear skates only and not take any shoes. Again I am not thrilled about<br/>\nthe idea but I say nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Because there is this issue of her rejecting my advice)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut half way through our double skating session her feet start hurting<br/>\nor she just decided she wanted to hang out with her friends rather<br/>\nthan skate whichever. So off came the skates and she shuffled around<br/>\nshoe less for the next couple of hours. A violation of the rules of<br/>\nthe establishment and to my dismay for the poor socks. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were leaving it was evening. She took her socks off to save<br/>\nthem from pavement dirt on the way to the car but she was cold. We<br/>\nstopped at her friends house to drop them off at home afterwards and<br/>\nit got later as we were hanging out. On her way home her feet were cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about the fact that she could have brought shoes even if she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to wear them out the door. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe NEXT day we are headed to a park day. There is no sun in the sky<br/>\nand tho this is CA where we in Northern to Middle CA have had a record<br/>\nwinter in terms of lovely temps it was nippy that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we are getting ready she decides she is wearing flip flops. I said<br/>\nget some shoes and socks. Now I meant wear them but I didn&#39;t utter<br/>\nthat and all I really needed her to do was bring them along.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe starts to argue with me and I start to argue with her. But I catch<br/>\nmyself. I am upset because it amazes me with this recent history of<br/>\nher shoe choices and the problems it has created she wouldn&#39;t think<br/>\nahead with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI calmly tell her all she has to do is bring the shoes.  I ask her<br/>\nwhat she has planned should she get cold while we are at the park<br/>\nbecause I tell her since I am packing and preparing it is unlikely<br/>\nthat I will want to turn around and come home over this issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nPouting she gathers them and I ask her to start packing the car. Just<br/>\ngoing from inside to the garage and putting things in the trunk she<br/>\ndecides her feet are FREEZING and opts against flip flops.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got to the park she was so cold she wanted to leave early (she<br/>\nalso didn&#39;t find any specific friends she wanted to play with so it&#39;s<br/>\nnot like she was too cold to have any fun.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried letting her reap her own consequences, and long before I<br/>\ntried having her be part of the decision making and plan for her own<br/>\ncomfort but she fought me on that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTosca & Lenelle (9)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110659280,"authorName":"Jen and Scott Lynch","from":"Jen and Scott Lynch &lt;j.slynch@...&gt;","profile":"eviemom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Experimental Baking","postDate":"1140091732","msgId":112123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5NjExNTUwOWE5NDFmZDgwMDRkZjI2YzgzMzk3N2RhQGNoYXJ0ZXIubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNDAwNTQ3MTAuMjA0NC44MzM4My5tMjZAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDExNDAwNTQ3MTAuMjA0NC44MzM4My5tMjZAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":112139,"prevInTime":112122,"nextInTime":112124,"topicId":112123,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Do you have to have &quot;mastered&quot; something to be able to do <br/>\nit alone?  If so, I need some serious supervision in my life because <br/>\nexcept maybe for breathing, I haven&#39;t mastered anything!LOL!  You only <br/>\ngave the example of cooking so I can&#39;t comment on any other situations <br/>\nof this phenomenon that is producing tension for you and your daughter. <br/>\nCooking seems to be an ideal venue for trying out independence.  It is <br/>\ncheap, very safe and endlessly variable.  If she wants to cook and bake <br/>\nwithout you, let her!  Then try the food and unless asked, hold the <br/>\ncomments to yourself!  My daughter will be six next month and has been <br/>\ncooking and baking (with an Easy Bake and in the regular kitchen) since <br/>\nshe was so small she couldn&#39;t even see the top of the counter.  Her <br/>\ncakes used to be a mixture of all sorts of &quot;un-cake-like&quot; things <br/>\n(paprika, flour, jelly) they were horrible to taste but a joy for her <br/>\nto make.  Over the years she has cooked with other people (mostly me) a <br/>\nlot.  She has watched A LOT of cooking shows and now she can even read <br/>\ncookbooks.  She has invented some delicious cakes (chocolate ginger is <br/>\nthe best.)  Except for taking things out of the big oven when she was <br/>\nlittler these are completely her projects.  Who cares if a cake doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave butter of leavening.  It might be good, it might be bad and it <br/>\nmight be different next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter might be on the cusp of a new development stage in her <br/>\nlife that is making her want your companionship but not your input (in <br/>\nother words, physically being there but not saying a word!)  Having <br/>\nbeen a being that experienced everything through her body in the early <br/>\nyears, she may be moving into a time when her emotions rule her <br/>\nthoughts and all experiences are filtered through those emotions.  This <br/>\nnew stage of life is often earmarked by increasing abilities and also <br/>\nincreasing desire to be able to &quot;do for oneself.&quot;  Appearance suddenly <br/>\nbecomes more important as does skills competence. (Steiner, Joseph <br/>\nChilton Pearce, Montessori--they all describe these various stages in <br/>\ndifferent ways.  There is a book called &quot;Natural Learning Rhythms&quot; by <br/>\nJosette and Sambatha Luvmour that distills it all nicely).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am trying to say is let her hurtle on ahead, trying <br/>\nthings, experimenting, succeeding, failing as Ms. Frizzle (Magic School <br/>\nBus) is fond of saying &quot;Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!&quot;  It <br/>\nmight be uncomfortable or even sad for your to &quot;watch from the outside&quot; <br/>\n  for awhile. But as long as she stills invites you in when she is <br/>\nexuberant or overwhelmed, you will be in good shape.  A person need not <br/>\n&quot;master&quot; something to do it, one just needs to DO IT!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes to you and your daughter!<br/>\n<br/>\nJen (who is eating a muffin experiment as we speak!)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://circletheworld.blogspot.com\">http://circletheworld.blogspot.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112313,"nextTopicId":112402}}
