It will  be <br/>\ninteresting to see if she&#39;s more likely to do her own talking without even  <br/>\nglancing <br/>\nback at me (as Kirby does) when she&#39;s home. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUpdate, on kid-confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly had a problem she wanted my help with before she&#39;d been home half a <br/>\nday.  A little neighbor had come over to see her (he&#39;s maybe 8 or 9, and she&#39;s <br/>\nknown him a long time), and I told him she was in England and wouldn&#39;t be back <br/>\nuntil the next day.  He came back.   She doesn&#39;t want to get involved with him <br/>\n(or his family) again, and though she sent him away, he lurked in the front <br/>\nyard, hiding, waiting for her to come out.  (He wanted her to go to the park <br/>\nwhere the free lunch is and she said she would be there after a while.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe cried, though, after he had gone (she thought), because she has tried in <br/>\nthe past to tell him no, don&#39;t come over; no, I don&#39;t want to hang out.  She <br/>\nsaid &quot;I wish Zeke (not his real name) didn&#39;t even know where I lived.&quot;  I said <br/>\nit might be a better wish to wish Zeke had some friends.&quot;   She said &quot;Zeke <br/>\nneeds a family that knows his name.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe feels he&#39;s just neglected and ignored bigtime at home.  She&#39;s been there <br/>\nlots, and would know.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe discussed strategies and the briefest, strongest things she might say <br/>\nwithout being cruel.  She can&#39;t figure out a way that won&#39;t make her seem like a <br/>\nhorrible person.  She cried some more.   I asked if she wanted me to talk to <br/>\nhim if he comes back and she seemed really relieved.  It will make me seem mean <br/>\ntoo, but Holly doesn&#39;t have an obligation to make him happy, and I do have <br/>\nsome obligation to help Holly live in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she found out he was hiding in the bushes out front and had never left, <br/>\nshe was less sympathetic, but she went with him to the park and then hung out <br/>\nwith another family when they got there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason he doesn&#39;t understand &quot;no&quot; is that he hears it too much at home.  <br/>\nHe has to remain hopeful in the face of &quot;no.&quot;   This is hard for Holly all <br/>\nkinds of ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106542,"nextTopicId":106515}}
