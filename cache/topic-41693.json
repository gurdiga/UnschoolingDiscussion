If people could see that the choice<br/>\nof language (in a lot of cases I know of personally, others I can&#39;t<br/>\ncomment on) is a message itself.  Saying things like &quot;you will only<br/>\nlisten if i talk like this&quot; or &quot;you aren&#39;t going to take me seriously no<br/>\nmatter what i do, so shock value will at least make you take notice of<br/>\nthis situation&quot; or &quot;i use this to put up a barrier between me and<br/>\neveryone who has hurt me&quot; or just &quot;you and people like you piss me off&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know I am getting up there (just 27 years old, but in the music<br/>\nbusiness that&#39;s almost over the hill!

IMO your son is reacting normally and you are doing a great<br/>\njob in keeping the line of communication open.
