Although I may not always agree with all <br/>\nof you ( I really think that is plain impossible with this bunch of ladies <br/>\nsince you&#39;re all SO different. Which keeps us all thinking, so it&#39;s a good <br/>\nthing lol),  I learn alot by you all making me think about things a little <br/>\nmore. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me share with you my EUREKA moment, and I know many will not agree with <br/>\nmy thinking, but I&#39;m hitting myself on the head over what I didnt&#39; see <br/>\nbefore. It hit me as I was thinking about how the more &quot;radical&quot; ladies allow <br/>\ntheir children to stay up to whatever hour they feel like TRUSTING their <br/>\nchild, letting their child play guns TRUSTING their child, etc. And, of <br/>\ncourse, I was thinking of the recent heated posts I&#39;ve read. I believe it was <br/>\nDawn who shared about the good thing about homeschooling is that in PS it&#39;s a <br/>\ndictatorship (I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve got the wrong person and I&#39;m sorry for <br/>\ntotally not saying it as eloquently as it was originally put). I was thinking <br/>\nabout that post when EUREKA. I am a hypocrite. I tell others I want to be <br/>\nrespected for having my own beliefs, that I don&#39;t like being told my way of <br/>\ndoing things is wrong, that I want to be respected. YET, I tell my children <br/>\nwhat they are allowed to play with, where they are allowed to go, when they <br/>\nare allowed to go there, what television shows they are allowed to watch, <br/>\nwhat things they are allowed and not allowed to say. I understand and respect <br/>\nthat many people need those limits, as I strongly felt I needed. But for ME, <br/>\nMYSELF, MY OWN PERSONAL SELF, I hit a EUREKA moment. Who am I to tell others <br/>\nI want to be fully respected when I don&#39;t fully respect my children. Who am I <br/>\nto dictate my children&#39;s lives to the extent that I do when I despise anyone <br/>\ndictating my life in any way, shape, or form. Who am I to be a hypocrite.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been a dictator in our home. I have told my fiance that I do NOT want <br/>\nhim having encouraging my son to follow certain interests becaus I do not <br/>\nagree with them. I haven&#39;t allowed my children to watch certain television <br/>\nshows because I<br/>\nfeel they are against MY beliefs. I sit there and say I want my children to <br/>\nchoose to be christian for themselves, yet I push my christian beliefs on <br/>\nthem. Yet I tell others that I would never push my christian beliefs on <br/>\nanother person. I am a hypocrite. That is the conclusion I have come to. I <br/>\nhave tumbled it through my head most of the day. I debated about should I <br/>\nRELAX a bit more? Should I TRUST my children? Well, after that EUREKA moment, <br/>\nthe answer was YES (although a shaky yes because I have some very strong <br/>\nopinions about things that I know my children will pursue once I relax) I sat <br/>\ndown and shared this with my life partner and he got that &quot;dear in the <br/>\nheadlights&quot; look. I can only imagine the shock in his mind as I&#39;m telling him <br/>\nthat I&#39;m WRONG and I need to RELAX. He jumped up with how he&#39;s always wanted <br/>\nto take his son shooting, but he knows how I feel about guns. He wanted to <br/>\ntake our son to a monster truck race, BOY did I go off on him over that one! <br/>\nI have decided what my children will not watch, where they will not go, as <br/>\nwell as so much more. I have been a dictator, something I have said I detest. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s my EUREKA moment. Thanks to the debate this board offers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have come to these views of my own free will. No one from this board or <br/>\nanywhere else is standing behind me with a shotgun to my head. I have not <br/>\nbeen hypnotized, brainwashed, or drugged into a false conciesness.
