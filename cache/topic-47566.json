Dang!   He is honest,  but I think, again, he doesn&#39;t know-all and isn&#39;t the-end-all on everything!!<br/>\nNow, since he&#39;s on primetime TV,  tons of people will jump to the conclusion that he is right!<br/>\nCan you imagine,  making a child sit there when they are throwing up????   That&#39;s where common sense and compassion is totally absent.  &lt;sad&gt;  He&#39;s totally forcing them into their narrow mind set!  Yuck!<br/>\n <br/>\nOK,  I&#39;m calm now.<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n <br/>\n Mary Bianco &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a>&gt; wrote:&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The whole premise of a child lying about being tired (Myranda&#39;s response <br/>\nto Sandra&#39;s garage sale, mean Mom scenario) is really, really bugging me. <br/>\nHow would you decide as a parent when your child is truly tired or simply <br/>\nmanipulating you? UGH! If you trust your child from the beginning, they have <br/>\nno need to lie....no need to &quot;manipulate&quot; because they know that the adults <br/>\nare going to heed their requests and fulfill their needs. A parent that has <br/>\ndecided a child is lying about being tired (or hungry or anything else) is <br/>\nreally needing some help imo.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah this one gets me too. I had on Dr. Phil today while the baby was <br/>\nnapping and I was trying to catch up on my e-mail. I usually like what he <br/>\nsays but today was different. I never heard his views on children and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like what I heard. He was talking about discipline and taking things <br/>\naway from kids when they are &quot;bad.&quot; The one good thing I heard was him <br/>\ntrying to tell parents that spanking doesn&#39;t work. But I digress. He <br/>\nactually said that children have a dark side and will manipulate and conive <br/>\nto get their way. He was talking about time outs and this one couple said <br/>\ntheir child wouldn&#39;t stay in a time out. Dr. Phil asked how big the child <br/>\nwas and why couldn&#39;t the parent make then stay there? They said the kid <br/>\nwould scream the whole time. Dr. Phil said to force them to stay there and <br/>\nthen when they calmed down, inform them that their time out was now <br/>\nstarting. The parents said he would just start up again. Now this is the <br/>\nworst part. Dr. Phil said he&#39;s actually had kids that threw up and said they <br/>\nwere choking and dying while being made to stay there, just to ignore it and <br/>\nbe consistent. I had to turn off the TV. Don&#39;t think I can stomach to listen <br/>\nto him again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Myranda&#39;s view that most parent&#39;s don&#39;t make harmful choices does not hold <br/>\nwater. Having been involved in homeschooling for 15 years? How is it <br/>\npossible to not see this? In 1987 I was graduating from High School. And I <br/>\nbelieve you are younger than I Myranda. Just how is it possible that you <br/>\nhave been heavily involved in homeschooling before ever having children and <br/>\nwhile you were in HS? Or were you simply aware of it back then? &#39;Cuz <br/>\ninvolvement and awareness are two different things. I don&#39;t see how most <br/>\npeople are going to be heavily involved unless they are<br/>\nactually homeschooling, although there are rare exceptions.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of parents make harmful choices just out of ignorance as to <br/>\nother ways and also because how they have been raised. I know it was like <br/>\nthat with me. I can&#39;t say most or all or even halfd because I just don&#39;t <br/>\nknow. I just wish I had someone like the people on this list when I was <br/>\nraising my first. Whether it friends or just someone saying something in a <br/>\nstore. Maybe I would have come to a realization sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I was also wondering about the whole 15 year thing.

UGH! If you trust your child from the beginning, they have <br/>\nno need to lie....no need to &quot;manipulate&quot; because they know that the adults <br/>\nare going to heed their requests and fulfill their needs. A parent that has <br/>\ndecided a child is lying about being tired (or hungry or anything else) is <br/>\nreally needing some help imo.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah this one gets me too. I had on Dr. Phil today while the baby was <br/>\nnapping and I was trying to catch up on my e-mail. I usually like what he <br/>\nsays but today was different. I never heard his views on children and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like what I heard. He was talking about discipline and taking things <br/>\naway from kids when they are &quot;bad.&quot; The one good thing I heard was him <br/>\ntrying to tell parents that spanking doesn&#39;t work. But I digress. He <br/>\nactually said that children have a dark side and will manipulate and conive <br/>\nto get their way. He was talking about time outs and this one couple said <br/>\ntheir child wouldn&#39;t stay in a time out. Dr. Phil asked how big the child <br/>\nwas and why couldn&#39;t the parent make then stay there? They said the kid <br/>\nwould scream the whole time. Dr. Phil said to force them to stay there and <br/>\nthen when they calmed down, inform them that their time out was now <br/>\nstarting. The parents said he would just start up again. Now this is the <br/>\nworst part. Dr. Phil said he&#39;s actually had kids that threw up and said they <br/>\nwere choking and dying while being made to stay there, just to ignore it and <br/>\nbe consistent. I had to turn off the TV. Don&#39;t think I can stomach to listen <br/>\nto him again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Myranda&#39;s view that most parent&#39;s don&#39;t make harmful choices does not hold <br/>\nwater. Having been involved in homeschooling for 15 years? How is it <br/>\npossible to not see this? In 1987 I was graduating from High School. And I <br/>\nbelieve you are younger than I Myranda. Just how is it possible that you <br/>\nhave been heavily involved in homeschooling before ever having children and <br/>\nwhile you were in HS? Or were you simply aware of it back then? &#39;Cuz <br/>\ninvolvement and awareness are two different things. I don&#39;t see how most <br/>\npeople are going to be heavily involved unless they are<br/>\nactually homeschooling, although there are rare exceptions.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of parents make harmful choices just out of ignorance as to <br/>\nother ways and also because how they have been raised. I know it was like <br/>\nthat with me. I can&#39;t say most or all or even halfd because I just don&#39;t <br/>\nknow. I just wish I had someone like the people on this list when I was <br/>\nraising my first. Whether it friends or just someone saying something in a <br/>\nstore. Maybe I would have come to a realization sooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I was also wondering about the whole 15 year thing. Isn&#39;t Myranda one of <br/>\nthe youngest if not the youngest on the list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nInternet access plans that fit your lifestyle -- join MSN. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10294444,"authorName":"Myranda","from":"&quot;Myranda&quot; &lt;myrandab@...&gt;","profile":"randascloudream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] trusting children","postDate":"1035405842","msgId":47570,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1NzcwMWMyN2FkNCRlZDI2ZTVjMCQwMTNmZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDExOC4xOTk5MDZmOS4yYWU4NWY5OUBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47566,"nextInTopic":47606,"prevInTime":47569,"nextInTime":47571,"topicId":47566,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Having been involved in homeschooling for 15 years?

I can&#39;t STAND this particular <br/>\nteacher, but it was only a make up lesson, not her regular coach and she <br/>\nwanted to go.<br/>\nThe teacher makes 3 and 4 year olds get in line, name letters of the alphabet <br/>\netc.... all in the gymnastics class and gives them time out if they don&#39;t do <br/>\nas they&#39;re told.<br/>\nAll the parents applaud the whole sick class, probably feeling their little <br/>\ndarlings are being prepared for school better (well sure, start sucking their <br/>\nability to think for themselves even sooner) but I can hardly stand to sit <br/>\nthere.<br/>\nFirst of all, most 3 and 4 year olds don&#39;t need to take any kind of class to <br/>\nenjoy tumbling.<br/>\nAnd then, to add insult to injury, the parents berate their own children when <br/>\nthey cry after being put in time out.<br/>\nSick, sick, sick. If it were up to me, I&#39;d never, ever go back. But Sierra <br/>\nseems oblivious because SHE is always doing exactly as the teacher says, <br/>\nloves it.<br/>\nAs I sit there, I see toddlers strapped into strollers even against their <br/>\nwill.<br/>\nI am the ONLY Mom that will follow her toddler around, even walking outside <br/>\nfor long periods of time to splash in puddles or find rocks.<br/>\nI hear scoldings and withholding of desired items, all for a damn class that <br/>\nis supposed to be FUN!! So much for most parents not making harmful choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a problem today within our support group in which a boy was name <br/>\ncalling a lot and the other kids asked him to please go away until he could <br/>\nstop.<br/>\nIt ended up with the Mother feeling defensive, the child being in denial <br/>\nabout what he had done and the unschooling kids scratching their heads trying <br/>\nto figure out how to deal with people like this.<br/>\nI see so much destructive behavior, even among homeschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyranda&#39;s view that most parent&#39;s don&#39;t make harmful choices does not hold <br/>\nwater.<br/>\nHaving been involved in homeschooling for 15 years?
