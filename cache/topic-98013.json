We  have two children, 18 & 10. Both of my sons attended private school last year due to a serious car accident one of our relatives was in and some other personal issues.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have been fascinated by homeschooling and especially unschooling. MY 10 year old has begged to homeschool this year. His classroom size would be 24 in this private school and he really wants to be home. He would be attending fourth grade due to the high academic regiment. Yuk!<br/>\nI am sure many of you have faced trails in your own families. Where do I start? What can I do for him to make his year easier and also not have family/friends question my ability to homeschool him since we have had trauma in our family from these accidents? Why do people think we need to put our children in school and this will be better for them when they beg you to keep them home? I know I am ranting a little here...Unschooling just seems to fit our family. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for reading and I enjoy getting to know you all alittle more. <br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
