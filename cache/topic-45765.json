Who wait until<br/>\nthey are good and ready to do something and then do it practically <br/>\novernight? For whom frustration can be often be overwhelming? In my<br/>\nson&#39;s case, frustration seems to be more of a hindrance then a help.<br/>\nSo yes, I try to help him avoid frustration...he gets so mad at himself<br/>\nwhen he tries to write and the letters do not look good enough (for him,<br/>\nnot for me). We have talked about how practice will help him improve and<br/>\nhow things do not have to be perfect. But he still gets so mad at himself.<br/>\nSo I do not push it and I am sure that he most likely will pick it up <br/>\novernight. The way that he learns is to *watch*, not necessarily do. We have<br/>\na Lemmings computer game...he likes me to play while he watches. He has gradually<br/>\nincreased the levels that he will try on his own. This does not mean that he<br/>\nwill not try something on his own, just that if the frustration level gets too<br/>\nhigh for him, he shuts down. So I guess that I see frustration as more of a hindrance<br/>\nthen a motivating factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also been looking at why I learn things and sometimes it is because I get<br/>\nfrustrated and want a better way, but most times it is more from a desire to learn<br/>\nmore about the subject. I started looking into hsing because I met some folks online<br/>\nwho talked about it and it seemed like a really neat way to learn. Before meeting<br/>\nthem I would have been perfectly fine sending Jason to school. I loved it myself.<br/>\nAfter reading and thinking more about it, I realized that learning from life was just a <br/>\ncool way to learn. There have been lots of things that I have learned in my life that<br/>\nwere easy to learn and did not involve frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it is just the connotation of the word for me. I see frustration like the dictionary<br/>\ndefinition as a negative. Learning for me is not a negative thing. It is born out of a <br/>\ndesire to learn more. If it is something challenging, there may be frustration involved,<br/>\nbut I do not see that frustration is required in order to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely love American History. I find it fascinating. I am not frustrated by my<br/>\nlack of knowledge, but if there is a pbs show that sounds interesting, I will watch it.<br/>\nIf I find a good book that sounds interesting I read it. Because it interests me. As<br/>\nan aside...I was watching the pbs show Founding Fathers and I learned something that <br/>\nfascinated me...when there was debate about whether to start a national bank, Hamilton<br/>\nand Jefferson argued about whether to do so was constitutional (Hamilton for and Jefferson<br/>\nagainst). I just thought that it was so neat to think that even the people who wrote<br/>\nthe constitution had debates over what was constitutional or not. Call me weird I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the rambling...just still mulling over whether frustration is necessary for <br/>\nlearning...<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":234387,"authorName":"Andrea","from":"Andrea &lt;andrea@...&gt;","profile":"runmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: the role of frustration","postDate":"1034214690","msgId":46039,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjEuMjAwMjEwMDkyMjQzMzQuMDBhMjhlYzBAcG9wMS5ucy5zeW1wYXRpY28uY2E+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMzQxOTc1NTEuMzUyMi4zNjc4My5tNEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46002,"nextInTopic":46041,"prevInTime":46038,"nextInTime":46040,"topicId":45765,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Gestures of kindness.<br/>\nHow are you going to discern when your child really needs help if you think <br/>\nyou can tell without asking? You are claiming to know a real cry from a not <br/>\nneedy one. How? You can&#39;t feel what that person is feeling. I assume that my <br/>\nchild needs something when they cry. I assume they need some assistance when <br/>\nfrustrated. If I&#39;ve assumed wrong, there is no harm done because they will <br/>\nlet me know that I am not needed at that particular point.But if I withhold <br/>\nmy help, they will learn that I&#39;m not to be trusted.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading these posts and have to agree with Ren&#39;s line of thinking. <br/>\n(don&#39;t get a big head Ren!) I think we all at some time or another feel <br/>\nfrustration. I don&#39;t think it feels good or is absolutely necessary for us <br/>\nto learn something. I think it is important when one sees it to offer any <br/>\nhelp or suggestions and like Ren said, no when to back off is that person <br/>\nwants to do it themselves. My daughter will take an offer of help readily, <br/>\nmy son wants to be left to his own devices. With him, I don&#39;t see it as <br/>\nfrustration as much as determination. I always offer, and once in awhile he <br/>\nwill let me suggest or help. That may ver well be when he IS getting <br/>\nfrustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as a baby crying, I think all cries need to be attended to. A <br/>\nlittle squirming or fussing when a baby is trying to settle down is one <br/>\nthing, as someone else mentioned. Crying is another. We always had a saying <br/>\naround here when the kids were little. &quot;No crying babies in this house.&quot; <br/>\nThat meant we did whatever we could to comfort to make the crying go away. <br/>\nIt worked and our kids are better because of it. I don&#39;t how many times I <br/>\nhad been reprimanded by &#39;well meaning&#39; people? who said to them let them cry <br/>\nit out.
