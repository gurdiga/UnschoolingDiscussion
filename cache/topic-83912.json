I recently read something about <br/>\n&quot;biblical sexual feats&quot; about David and Bathsheba&#39;s affair.. it was.. ahem.. <br/>\ninteresting.. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n###########<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere did you read it? Book, Internet, magazine??? Do tell me please! <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I think Bathsheba is one of the most maligned women in the Bible. <br/>\nPeople (preachers, historians...) place the blame squarely on her, when it was <br/>\nDavid who wasn&#39;t where HE was supposed to be. Back in the day kings went off <br/>\nto war. But David, for some reason stayed at home. Maybe he was too old, but <br/>\ntwice the writer of these verses tells us that David stayed at home, reinforcing <br/>\nthe idea that David, obviously wasn&#39;t where he was supposed to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2 Samuel 1:12; we are told that David has risen from his couch and takes a <br/>\nwalk on the roof of his house, where he sees a woman bathing, and that she <br/>\nwas very beautiful. It doesn&#39;t state that Bathsheba flaunted herself, it states <br/>\nthat David was watching her, unknown to her. Then he sends some guys to go get <br/>\nher, and commands that she come to him. As a good subject she goes. He bids <br/>\nher to lay with him and then we are told that she just gets up and goes home. <br/>\nSo she isn&#39;t the greedy manipulator so often portrayed. Later she has to send <br/>\nword to David that she is pregnant. Some have said that she planned the <br/>\npregnancy, but how? If she didn&#39;t know that the king was a peeping tom, and she only <br/>\nwent to him as a subject of a king, and although she did have sex with him, <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t hang around plotting something, she went home. So David calls her <br/>\nhusband home from battle and tries to get him to take a little R&R, but being the <br/>\nloyal soldier, Uriah will have none of it. Here we see that Uriah, the <br/>\nforeigner is a better man than the king he is serving. David tries two or three <br/>\ntimes to get the guy to go home. (He wants Uriah to go home and do what all men do <br/>\non return to their wives after a long campaign, so maybe Uriah will think the <br/>\nchild is his.) Finally David sends Uriah back out to war, and sends him to <br/>\nthe front lines where he is sure to get killed. At this point, Bathsheba becomes <br/>\nDavid&#39;s wife and because of this, many would tell us that Bathsheba is the <br/>\ninstigator of this devious little plan, but really it is David who has committed <br/>\nthe sin and then makes even bigger sins trying in vain to cover up. Alas, he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get away with it. Nathan delivers a prophesy telling David that his <br/>\nson will be struck down. And he is. We would assume that David would then not go <br/>\nback and &quot;be&quot; with Bathsheba, but he does and eventually he and she have <br/>\nanother son, Solomon. And that is a whole &#39;nother story. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, you didn&#39;t want a Bible lesson? Sorry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"Julie Solich","from":"&quot;Julie Solich&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","profile":"foxymophandlemama32","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: tracts- Trunk or Treat","postDate":"1068168678","msgId":84076,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTYwMWMzYTRjZSRkODYzMjNlMCQ3YjY5MzJkMkBtYXJrPg==","referencesHeader":"PDJmLjQxMWUyNjU4LjJjZGJkMGZiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":84075,"nextInTopic":84092,"prevInTime":84075,"nextInTime":84077,"topicId":83912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... she ... of ... red ... pillar of salt.

Many of <br/>\nthem with strong, smart, biding their time, women behind them. <br/>\n<br/>\nJezebel helped her husband out. He had more land than he knew what to do <br/>\nwith, yet he still wanted this one small vineyard, so Jezebel frames the man. He <br/>\nis charged with the capital offense of cursing God&#39;s name, and is stoned to <br/>\ndeath. However, God punishes her as she is cursed to be eaten by dogs within the <br/>\ncity walls, her corpse would be like dung on fields so no one could bury her, <br/>\nor say *this is Jezebel*. Meaning that no trace of her would exist and no one <br/>\ncould go to a grave and say &quot;here she is.&quot;  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;A girl could dress up like Jezebel and hang stuffed dogs off of herself, as <br/>\n </span></blockquote>if they were biting and eating her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is Bathsheba; King David fell so hopelessly in love with her he calls <br/>\nfor her, has sex with her and knocks her up. Oops! She has a husband, So David <br/>\nsends her husband, Uriah, back out into battle. Specifically the front lines <br/>\nso he would be killed so David and Bathsheba could keep their little secret. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;A girl could dress up as if she were pregnant and drag around the corpse of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her murdered husband. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid sends Rizpah&#39;s, a concubine of Saul, son&#39;s into the hands of the <br/>\nGibeonites. The Gibeonites impaled the men and left their bodies out in the <br/>\nelements. Rizpah bravely leaves her home, and goes out to sit with the men&#39;s bodies, <br/>\nkeeping birds and animals from further desecrating the bodies. She stands out <br/>\nthere by her children, away from her duties at home for months! Rotting <br/>\ndecaying bodies, and she stays by them to keep them from suffering further insult by <br/>\nbecoming carrion. David sees her loyalty and brave actions and has the bodies <br/>\nremoved for proper, honorable burial. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Dress up in sackcloth and have two dolls spiked beside you? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is Delilah; she was a paid &quot;spy&quot;. She gained Samson&#39;s &quot;love&quot; and <br/>\ntricked him into telling her the source of his strength. The problem with this story <br/>\nis that she had to trick Samson three or four times before he would tell her <br/>\nabout his hair, and each time she was caught in the act and yet he still goes <br/>\nback to her and tells her more and more! <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;A girl could dress up as a slutty hairdresser of Israel and a boy could <br/>\n </span></blockquote>dress up as the stupid Samson. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJael goes out and tricks an enemy of the Israelites, killing him with <br/>\nkindness, and finally a tent peg. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;A blood covered woman with a tent peg in her hand and a bloody head in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>other?<br/>\n<br/>\nI love reading about the women in the bible. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133144498,"authorName":"The Scanlons","from":"&quot;The Scanlons&quot; &lt;scanlon36@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: tracts- Trunk or Treat","postDate":"1068147958","msgId":84023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMGEwMWMzYTQ5ZSQ5YTczMjAxMCQ1OWE0NGVkNUBST0JFUlRCQ1hHUzBGTD4=","referencesHeader":"PDFlMS4xMmQ1Y2JkYS4yY2RiYzhiM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84011,"nextInTopic":84025,"prevInTime":84022,"nextInTime":84024,"topicId":83912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-637467456\">&lt;&lt;The boys would have much better choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls could be any of those choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: tracts- Trunk or Treat","postDate":"1068146902","msgId":84027,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCRDAwQjA2LjIwODVDJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMGEwMWMzYTQ5ZSQ5YTczMjAxMCQ1OWE0NGVkNUBST0JFUlRCQ1hHUzBGTD4="},"prevInTopic":84025,"nextInTopic":84034,"prevInTime":84026,"nextInTime":84028,"topicId":83912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Every reason I gave had to do with convenience, not fear.   Pam <br/>\nmentioned that she was not comfortable getting candy from folks she didn&#39;t know.. I <br/>\ncan certainly respect that.. But, in my case, I was born and raised here, .. <br/>\n36 years of living in the same community.. I DO know the folks that live around <br/>\nme, and I trust them.     My children choose what they want to do for <br/>\nHalloween, and since our local churches began trunk or treat, that is their choice.   <br/>\nIt has nothing to do with fear, it has to do with fun.
