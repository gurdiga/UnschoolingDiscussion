Different cultures receive their gifts on different days. <br/>\nSt. Nicholas Day, Ephiphany Sunday and the Ukrainian Christmas aren&#39;t on <br/>\n12/25.  Given all this, I&#39;d say that the numbers of deliveries are greatly <br/>\nreduced, thereby changing the calculations.<br/>\nAnimals other than reindeer are believed to be used in other countries, so <br/>\nthe reindeer can rest or be replaced.
