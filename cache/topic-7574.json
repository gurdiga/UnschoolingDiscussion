We<br/>\nbought cheap clay pots which we had the kids (14 of them ranging in age from<br/>\n3 to 12) paint and then take home fullid with , among other things seeds to<br/>\nplant some flowers in the pots. They all ended up enjoying the pot-painting.<br/>\nI learned so much at this party... one thing was how important the gift<br/>\nopening part is... we did the gift opening relatively early on so it was<br/>\ncompletely relaxed and there was lots of time to fully appreciate what each<br/>\nchild had brought.  The other main event was a treasure hunt.... and then a<br/>\nlittle free time while wating for all the parents to show up.  For the<br/>\ntreasure hunt I made a detailed map of our house and yard, and then cut it<br/>\nup into 6 pieces and wrote a rather complicated clue on each peice...  They<br/>\nhad to save all the clues to put together at the end to find the treasure on<br/>\nthe map.  (it was buried 2 feet under in the garden :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWHen it was all over I felt like I had been run over by a mack truck... but<br/>\nI think next time will not be so stressful.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoshua<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 29, 2000 10:01 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Typical unschooling day(long)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 03/29/2000 5:46:33 PM !!!First Boot!!!,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a><br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;  Your post should have come with a disclaimer in Bold to the effect that<br/>\n&gt; while<br/>\n&gt;  this is a &quot;typical&quot; day for your family it&#39;s not what you&#39;d be doing<br/>\nevery<br/>\n&gt;  day and &quot;typically&quot; leads to exhaustion and a need for a restorative day.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt;  envision some poor newbie mom out there who signed off the list convinced<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt;  just doesn&#39;t have the stamina to &quot;do unschooling.&quot;  :) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Even the &quot;off&quot; days seem like a lot when you sit down and think about what<br/>\n&gt; you did.
