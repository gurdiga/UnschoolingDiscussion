I have four children<br/>\n&gt; ages 16, 14, 12, 10. We have always homeschooled. We started out quite<br/>\n&gt; structured and have been loosing up more and more each year. I first heard<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; unschooling when we went online a few years ago. Now I consider us to be<br/>\n&gt; apart of this wonderful lifestyle. The kids do use Math-u-See math books<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; it is their choice and I do not require it. Matter of fact my 10 year old<br/>\n&gt; said he does not want to do it for a while and that is ok. We also read<br/>\naloud<br/>\n&gt; together almost daily and enjoy it very much. Right now we all have an<br/>\n&gt; interest in ancient history, so that is what we have been reading. Boy I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt; learned a lot. It is so interesting. (But we did take a break to read the<br/>\n&gt; newest Harry Potter book recently!) The kids came to me yesterday telling<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; somethings they would like to check out. The oldest saw the book<br/>\nBlueprints<br/>\n&gt; for Geometry in a catalog and wants to try it. The 14 yr. old wants to<br/>\nlearn<br/>\n&gt; Japanese, an interest that stems from the Japanese terms they use in<br/>\nkarate.<br/>\n&gt; All the sudden this summer all the kids have gotten excited about playing<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; sax and clarinet we have here. The boys found art and science books they<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; to try.  And this is pretty much how it goes. We live in the country on a<br/>\nfew<br/>\n&gt; acres. We live pretty simply except for this pc which has become a<br/>\nnecessity.<br/>\n&gt; We do love the internet! :)<br/>\n&gt;     My husband works a lot of hours in the summer for a construction<br/>\ncompany<br/>\n&gt; but winter is coming. The kids and I earn money selling items on ebay. And<br/>\n&gt; the kids clean a house for a neighbor to pay for karate classes. The kids<br/>\n&gt; also race BMX. Seems like we are seldom bored.<br/>\n&gt;     I look forward to meeting you all<br/>\n&gt; Candy<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I never let schoolin interfer with my education&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Mark Twain<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Whyner@aol.com","from":"Whyner@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Sb1XI1iH785O17Fa10sI1TUK2r7_6jKL3Vj1kHPAN1YsCEi9eYclP1WLyVN3TkyltgetB-A","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New Here","postDate":"965424314","msgId":11747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkuOGY5YmIyYS4yNmJjOGViYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11746,"nextInTopic":11750,"prevInTime":11746,"nextInTime":11748,"topicId":11739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/4/00 1:18:17 PM Eastern Daylight Time, discovery6@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1073945223\">In a message dated 8/4/00 1:18:17 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:discovery6@...\">discovery6@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  look forward to meeting you all<br/>\n Candy<br/>\n &quot;I never let schoolin interfer with my education&quot;<br/>\n Mark Twain<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nice to meet you Candy!
