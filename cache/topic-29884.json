Supposedly,<br/>\nthere was a disorder which caused certain children to &quot;mispronounce&quot; certain<br/>\nwords in certain ways, and these children were much more likely to later<br/>\nexhibit violent or delinquent behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....guess how they pronounced the words? Like people who speak Black<br/>\nEnglish (or whatever it&#39;s called now - I was out of the country for years)<br/>\ndo. Why did they speak this way? Because they were disproportionately<br/>\nAfrican American, and lived in high crime areas in low-income families,<br/>\nwhere Black English is most commonly spoken.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, nothing new had really been discovered. But if somebody had<br/>\nannounced that low-income African American kids from high-crime areas were<br/>\ndisproportionately represented in juvenile lockups, it wouldn&#39;t have made<br/>\nheadlines. It probably wouldn&#39;t even have made headlines if somebody had<br/>\nsaid this was the case with kids who spoke Black English. (Yes, I know that<br/>\nthese kids are also disproportionately found guilty when they&#39;re really<br/>\ninnocent.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it was dressed it up as a neurologically-based disorder (the<br/>\n&quot;symptom&quot; was something very specific, like dropping the final &quot;s&quot; on verbs<br/>\nin the third person), and it was &quot;discovered&quot; by means of a big scientific<br/>\nstudy, it sounded like a breakthrough.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the &quot;neatness&quot; study itself: I would think that any sample might include,<br/>\nfor example, families that are on the brink of falling apart in all ways. I<br/>\nmean, if your mom&#39;s an alcoholic and your dad&#39;s suicidal, the house is<br/>\nlikely to be a mess, but we couldn&#39;t conclude that the cause of your failing<br/>\ngrades is simply messiness and that you&#39;d pass your tests if somebody got a<br/>\ncleaning service in there once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question, of course, is whether &quot;performing better academically&quot;<br/>\njust means jumping through the hoops in school (which you might be more<br/>\nlikely to do if you came from the kind of home where the parents are<br/>\ngenerally strict, both about schoolwork and about neatness). If that&#39;s the<br/>\nkind of &quot;success&quot; the study is pointing to, why do we care? If it&#39;s IQ<br/>\nscores, I&#39;m still unimpressed, both because I don&#39;t believe those scores<br/>\nmean much and because of the iffiness of neatness as the cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main point is that there&#39;s a big difference between showing some kind of<br/>\nlink and showing that one thing caused the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nElsa Haas<br/>\n<br/>\n  Susan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n   &lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just tossing this out for consideration.......<br/>\n<br/>\n  I saw a blurb in a magazine (Family Life or Family Fun) which staed a &quot;new<br/>\n  study&quot; has found that childrn who come from neat and clean homes perform<br/>\n  better academically.

I think <br/>\nchildren from organized homes probably do better in public schools <br/>\nfor a couple of reasons.  One, they can find their homework (and are <br/>\nprobably forced to do it at a specific time every day) and so always <br/>\nhave it ready to turn in.

I have a sil who keeps her house sp tidy,  people<br/>\nget uncomfortable.  I remember once while visiting,  her 13 yo son asked if<br/>\nhe could have hot cocoa.

He was not allowed because she felt she couldn&#39;t trust him to<br/>\nmake it without creating a mess.
