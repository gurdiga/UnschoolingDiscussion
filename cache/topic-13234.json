I&#39;d never heard of it before.  I <br/>\nknew the HP stuff was pure garbage because I read the books (actually I knew <br/>\neven before that because my son tells me all about what he reads.  A very <br/>\nvocal kid, that one is.  Book reports.  Yep.  We can check that off on our <br/>\nschool to-do list.  Ours are given orally and take longer than it took to <br/>\nread the book to begin with.  But, I digress...again!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I appreciate seeing what&#39;s going around.  I run into uninformed <br/>\npeople who think they have opinions.  One in particular, is the father of my <br/>\n12yr old ds.  The &#39;opinion&#39; posted about HP (based on Onion &#39;report&#39;) is <br/>\nprecisely the sort of thing he tries to use as logic to show that I&#39;m not a <br/>\ngood enough parent.  You would not believe what I got about Pokemon!  (You&#39;d <br/>\nhave to know this guy.  There is no way he has enough actual intelligence to <br/>\ncome up with this stuff on his own.  But he sure thinks he knows what he&#39;s <br/>\ntalking about and he tells the rest of us how much we are contributing the <br/>\nevil in the world at large.  I&#39;m ornery, if he states these &#39;opinions&#39; in <br/>\nfront of my ds, I argue with him.  Can&#39;t let such stupidity go unchallenged <br/>\nin front of my impressionable child.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least I now have a little better understanding of how these sorts of &#39;fact <br/>\nfilled opinions&#39; get started in the first place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUgh.<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13221,"nextTopicId":13208}}
