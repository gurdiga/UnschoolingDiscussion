There&#39;s a LOT of coins, and many, many of them are duplicates.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll sort you out some before I leave, if I have time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll be easy to find -- I&#39;ll be the one Kelly is running around like her<br/>\n&gt; personal conference-slave!  (I&#39;m coming in early and hanging around in S.C.<br/>\n&gt; for two weeks beforehand to see old friends, new friends, and hopefully be<br/>\n&gt; reasonably useful to Kelly.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ll find each other.
